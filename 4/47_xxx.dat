40|$|Abstract Introduction To {{the best}} of our knowledge, this is the first report of a {{comorbidity}} between Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome and <b>47</b> (<b>XXX)</b> syndrome. The clinical picture of Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome is well described, while <b>47</b> (<b>XXX)</b> syndrome is much more rare and has a broader spectrum of possible phenotypic presentations. Case presentation An Italian Caucasian girl was referred at the age of 11 to our Rehabilitation Center for anxiety and learning difficulties. The girl had already been diagnosed as having <b>47</b> (<b>XXX)</b> syndrome; she had some rather typical features of the chromosomal abnormality, but she also showed a high level of anxiety and the presence of motor and vocal tics. When an accurate history was taken, a diagnosis of Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome emerged. Conclusions The possible interaction between peculiar features of these two syndromes in terms of neuropsychological and affective functioning is both interesting for the specific case and to hypothesize models of rehabilitation for patients with one or both syndromes. Executive functions are specifically reduced in both syndromes, therefore it might be hard to discriminate the contribution of each one to the general impairment; the same applies to anxiety. Moreover, mental retardation (with a significantly lower verbal cognitive functioning) poses relevant problems when suggesting cognitive behavioral or psychoeducational rehabilitative approaches. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Turner {{syndrome}} is a chromosomal abnormality {{in which the}} majority of patients have a 45 XO karyotype, while a small number have a 45 XO/ <b>47</b> <b>XXX</b> karyotype. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia has been previously reported in patients with Turner syndrome. Although insulinomas {{are the most common}} type of functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and have been reported in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasias, the tumors have not been reported in patients with mosaic Turner syndrome. The present study reports the first case of an insulinoma in a patient with 45 XO/ <b>47</b> <b>XXX</b> mosaic Turner syndrome. The patient suffered from recurrent hypoglycemia, which was relieved following ingestion of glucose or food. A 5 -h glucose tolerance test was performed and the levels of glucose, C-Peptide and insulin were detected. In addition, computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound scanning were performed to evaluate the possibility of an insulinoma. Pathological examina-tion and karyotyping were performed on a surgical specimen and a whole blood sample, respectively. The patient was found to suffer from premature ovarian failure, and a physical exami-nation was consistent with a diagnosis of Turner syndrome. An ultrasound scan demonstrated streak ovaries and the patient was found to have a 45 XO/ <b>47</b> <b>XXX</b> karyotype. Furthermore, a lesion was detected in the pancreas following CT scanning, which was identified as an insulinoma following surgical removal and histological examination. In conclusion, the present study reports the first case of an insulinoma in a patient with mosaic Turner syndrome. Since mosaic Turner syndrome and insuli-noma are rare diseases, an association may exist that has not been previously identified...|$|E
40|$|Turner {{syndrome}} (TS), one of {{the most}} common sex chromosome disorders, is caused by numeric or structural abnormalities of the X chromosome. It occurs in approximately 1 in every 2, 500 newborns with female phenotype. The karyotypes are nonmosaic or mosaic, including 45,X, 46,X,del(Xp), 46,X,i(Xq), 45,X/ 46,XX, 45,X/ 46,XrX, 45,X/ 46,XY, 45 X/ <b>47</b> <b>XXX.</b> 45,X is a classical type. TS is associated with a variable spectrum of clinical features, the defi ning features being short stature, gonadal dysgenesis and infertility. 1 Numerous autoimmune diseases in TS patients have been reported, such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, Addison’s disease, psoriasis, celiac disease, vitiligo, alopecia areata. 2 However, SLE associated with TS has been rarely reported.

40|$|Background: Triple X {{syndrome}} (<b>47,</b> <b>XXX</b> or trisomy X) is {{a relatively}} frequent cytogenetic condition with a large variety of physical and behavioural phenotypes. Method: Two adult patients with a triple X karyotype are described. Results: Their karyotype was unknown until some years ago. What these patients {{have in common is}} that they were diagnosed with a broader autism phenotype, they were sexually abused, they suffer from psychotic illness and they show challenging behaviour, suicidality and a decline in occupational capacity. Discussion: These gene-environment interactions are discussed. Gene-environment interactions may explain the variety of behavioural and psychiatric phenotypes in triple X syndrome. Ongoing atypical development in adults is hypothesized. Conclusions: Gene-environment interactions and ongoing atypical development in adults should be taken into account in research concerning the psychiatric phenotype of developmental disorders, especially those involving triple X syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Fetal {{congenital}} chylothorax {{is a rare}} {{condition that}} occurs sporadically or {{can be associated with}} abnormal karyotype or structural chromosomal anomalies. We report a unique case of fetal congenital bilateral chylothorax associated with mosaicism 47,XXX/ 46,XX. A female fetus affected by massive bilateral hydrothorax and ascites was diagnosed at 34 + 1 weeks of gestation. Previous ultrasonographic exams were completely normal. Immune causes of hydrops were excluded. Elective cesarean section was performed soon after bilateral thoracocentesis. The analysis of drained pleural fluid revealed its lymphatic nature. The fetal karyotyping, performed on chorionic villi at the 11 th week, had shown mosaicism 47,XXX/ 46,XX, later confirmed in the newborn's blood. We hypothesized that chylothorax may be part of the phenotypic spectrum of <b>47</b> <b>XXX</b> karyotype and we suggest an ultrasound follow-up of the fetus at closer intervals than the routine timing for this condition, even if it is not usually characterized by severe phenotypic feature...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Turner Syndrome (TS) {{is caused}} by {{monosomy}} or structural abnormalities of the X chromosome, with a prevalence of about 1 / 2000 females live birth. Most important clinical features of TS are short stature and gonadal failure. Approximately one third of girls with TS may undergo spontaneous puberty. Here {{we report on the}} case of a girl with a rare 45 X 0 / <b>47</b> <b>XXX</b> mosaic TS exhibiting a precocious puberty. Case report The patient was diagnosed with TS at the age of 4 years, upon a diagnostic work-up for dysmorphic features. Chromosome analysis revealed a mosaic karyotype (45 X 0 / <b>47</b> <b>XXX).</b> She presented with normal height and normal growth velocity so that Growth Hormone (GH) therapy was not started. She was referred to our Department at the age of 7 years and 10 months, because of vaginal bleeding. A physical examination revealed a Tanner stage III for breast and Tanner stage III for pubic hair development. Height and weight were within the normal range for age. Psychological evaluation showed moderate global developmental delay, together with emotional and social immaturity and reading difficulties. The growth rate was accelerated. Her bone age was 10 years. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated increased size for age of both the uterus and the ovaries, with bilateral ovarian follicles. GnRH stimulation test revealed pubertal response of gonadotropins (peak LH 22. 5 mIU/ml). MRI of the brain was normal. These clinical, radiologic and laboratory findings were consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic central precocious puberty; therefore, GnRH analog therapy was started, in order to slow pubertal progression and to preserve adult stature. Furthermore, GH treatment was added to further improve adult height. CONCLUSION: Our case highlights the possibility of precocious puberty as an atypical clinical feature of TS. Thus, precocious puberty may occur in TS girls when a dosage compensation by the cell line with more than two X chromosomes allows normal ovarian function. GnRH analog therapy in addition to GH treatment should be recommended in TS girls with precocious puberty in order to slow pubertal progression and to preserve adult stature...|$|E
40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND—Females with Turner {{syndrome}} commonly exhibit ophthalmological abnormalities, {{although there}} is little information in the literature documenting findings specific to Turner syndrome mosaics. Ophthalmic findings are described in four patients with mosaic Turner syndrome. All had anterior chamber abnormalities and all four had karyotypic abnormalities with a 45, X cell line. The possible relation between the karyotypic and the phenotypic findings in these patients is discussed.  METHODS—Four girls with mosaic Turner syndrome underwent a full ophthalmological assessment, including examination under anaesthesia where indicated.  RESULTS—Three of the four patients presented with congenital glaucoma. Two had the karyotype 45, X/ 46, X, idic(Y) and one a 45, X/ <b>47,</b> <b>XXX</b> karyotype. The remaining child had a Rieger malformation of the iris and the karyotype 45, X/ 46, X, r(X).  CONCLUSIONS—These findings suggest that Turner syndrome mosaicism (where there are two abnormal cell lines) is associated with anterior segment dysgenesis. The findings in these four patients are compared with those seen in other mosaic phenotypes and it is postulated {{that the presence of}} two or more genetically different cell lines may have an adverse effect on anterior segment development. ...|$|E
40|$|The temperature-sensitive ts A 1 S 9 {{mutation}} of mouse L cells {{was previously}} shown to affect nuclear DNA replication {{and to be}} complemented by active and inactive human X chromosomes in human-ts A 1 S 9 somatic cell hybrids. We report the isolation of cDNA clones which correct the ts A 1 S 9 lesion, using as a probe a genomic fragment derived from the human A 1 S 9 locus. The nucleotide sequence of the A 1 S 9 cDNA encompasses a single open reading frame of 2409 bp which could encode a heretofore unreported protein of 90 393 daltons. Southern blot hybridization of the A 1 S 9 cDNA probe with DNA from various species revealed homologous sequences in vertebrates but not in yeast. Northern blot analysis of serum-starved, synchronized cells demonstrated that the A 1 S 9 gene was expressed at a relatively low level in quiescent cells and at a higher and constant level throughout the cell cycle. Human cell lines harbouring increasing numbers of inactive X chromosomes (<b>47,</b> <b>XXX,</b> 49, XXXXX) were found to express the A 1 S 9 gene {{at the same level}} as control cells (45, X), suggesting that the gene does not escape X chromosome inactivation...|$|E
40|$|Aneuploidies are {{the most}} {{frequent}} chromosomal abnormalities at birth. Autosomal aneuploidies cause serious malformations like trisomy 21, trisomy 18 and trisomy 13. However sex chromosome aneuploidies are causing less severe syndromes. For the detection of these aneuploidies, the “gold standard” method is the cytogenetic analysis of fetal cells, karyograms show all numerical and structural abnormalities, but it takes 2 – 4 weeks to get the reports. Molecular biological methods were developed to overcome the long culture time, thus, FISH and quantitative fluorescent PCR were introduced. In this work we show our experience with a commercial kit {{for the detection of}} sex chromosome aneuploidies. MethodsWe analyzed 20. 173 amniotic fluid samples for the period of 2006 – 2013 in our department. A conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed on the samples. We checked the reliability of quantitative fluorescent PCR and DNA fragment analysis on those samples where sex chromosomal aneuploidy was diagnosed. ResultsFrom the 20. 173 amniotic fluid samples we found 50 samples with sex chromosome aneuploidy. There were 19 samples showing 46, XO, 17 samples with 46, XXY, 9 samples with <b>47,</b> <b>XXX</b> and 5 samples with 47, XYY karyotypes. The applied quantitative fluorescent PCR and DNA fragment analyses method are suitable to detect all abnormal sex chromosome aneuploidies. ConclusionsQuantitative fluorescent PCR is a fast and reliable method for detection of sex chromosome aneuploidies...|$|E
40|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} polycystic {{liver disease}} (ADPLD) {{is caused by}} variants in PRKCSH, SEC 63, and LRP 5, whereas autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is caused by variants in PKD 1 and PKD 2. Liver cyst development in these disorders is explained by somatic loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type allele in the developing cyst. We hypothesize {{that we can use}} this mechanism to identify novel disease genes that reside in LOH regions. In this study, we aim to map abnormal genomic regions using high-density SNP microarrays to find novel PLD genes. We collected 46 cysts from 23 patients with polycystic or sporadic hepatic cysts, and analyzed DNA from those cysts using high-resolution microarray (n= 24) or Sanger sequencing (n= 22). We here focused on regions of homozygosity on the autosomes (> 3. 0 Mb) and large CNVs (> 1. 0 Mb). We found frequent LOH in PRKCSH (22 / 29) and PKD 1 /PKD 2 (2 / 3) cysts of patients with known heterozygous germline variants in the respective genes. In the total cohort, 12 / 23 patients harbored abnormalities outside of familiar areas. In individual ADPLD cases, we identified germline events: a 2 q 13 complex rearrangement resulting in BUB 1 haploinsufficiency, a <b>47</b> <b>XXX</b> karyotype, chromosome 9 q copy-number loss, and LOH on chromosome 3 p. The latter region was overlapping with an LOH region identified in two other cysts. Unique germline and somatic abnormalities occur frequently in and outside of known genes underlying cysts. Each liver cyst has a unique genetic makeup. LOH driver gene BUB 1 may imply germline causes of genetic instability in PLD...|$|E
