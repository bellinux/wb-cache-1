5000|$|... <b>4-Aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> (p-aminobenzoic acid or para-aminobenzoic acid) ...|$|E
50|$|Diethylethanolamine {{can be used}} as a {{precursor}} chemical to procaine. It can be reacted with <b>4-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> to make procaine.|$|E
50|$|Azide {{has been}} used {{traditionally}} as an MPO inhibitor, but <b>4-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> hydrazide (4-ABH) is a more specific inhibitor of MPO.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-Nitrobenzoic acid is a {{precursor}} to <b>4-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> which is in turn used to prepare the anesthetic procaine. 4-Nitrobenzoic acid is prepared by oxidation of 4-nitrotoluene.|$|E
50|$|Examples in {{chemistry}} include Tyrosine and <b>4-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid.</b> The former may be deprotonated {{to form the}} carboxylate and phenoxide anions, and the later may be protonated at the amino or carboxyl groups.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} drugs {{interfere}} with the biosynthesis of folic acid and THF. Among them are the [...] such as trimethoprim, pyrimethamine, and methotrexate; the sulfonamides (competitive inhibitors of <b>4-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> in the reactions of dihydropteroate synthetase).|$|E
50|$|Pteridine is a {{precursor}} in {{the synthesis of}} dihydrofolic acid in many microorganisms. The enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase converts pteridine and <b>4-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> to dihydrofolic acid {{in the presence of}} glutamate. The enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase is inhibited by sulfonamide antibiotics.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-Nitrobenzoic acid is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C6H4(NO2)CO2H. It is a pale yellow solid. It is {{a precursor to}} 4-nitrobenzoyl chloride, the precursor to the anestheic Procaine and folic acid. It is also a precursor to <b>4-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 4-Fluorobenzoic acid is commercially available. It may be {{prepared}} via the Schiemann reaction, {{in which a}} <b>4-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> protected as the ethyl ester, is diazotised and then fluoride introduced using tetrafluoroborate. Hydrolysis of the ester converts {{it back to the}} free acid.|$|E
5000|$|Benzocaine can be {{prepared}} by esterification using <b>4-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> and ethanol. [...] It can also {{be prepared}} by reduction of ethyl 4-nitrobenzoate to the amine. [...] In industrial practice, the reducing agent is usually iron and water {{in the presence of}} a little acid.|$|E
50|$|Padimate O is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{related to the}} water-soluble compound PABA (<b>4-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid)</b> that is used as an ingredient in some sunscreens. This yellowish water-insoluble oily liquid is an ester formed by the condensation of 2-ethylhexanol with dimethylaminobenzoic acid. Other names for padimate O include 2-ethylhexyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate, Escalol 507, octyldimethyl PABA, and OD-PABA.|$|E
50|$|Procaine can be {{synthesized}} in two ways. The first {{consists of}} the direct reaction of the <b>4-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> ethyl ester with 2-diethylaminoethanol {{in the presence of}} sodium ethoxide. The second is by oxidizing 4-nitrotoluene to 4-nitrobenzoic acid, which is further reacted with thionyl chloride, the resulting acid chloride is then esterified with 2-diethylaminoethanol. Finally, the nitro group is reduced by hydrogenation over Raney nickel catalyst.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>4-Aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> (also {{known as}} para-aminobenzoic acid or PABA {{because the number}} 4 carbon in the benzene ring {{is also known as}} the para position) is an organic {{compound}} with the formula H2NC6H4CO2H. PABA is a white solid, although commercial samples can appear gray. It is slightly soluble in water. It consists of a benzene ring substituted with amino and a carboxyl groups. The compound occurs naturally.|$|E
5000|$|... (6S)-6-Fluoroshikimic acid is an {{antibacterial}} agent {{acting on the}} aromatic biosynthetic pathway. It may be used against Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. The molecule is targeting the enzymes of the shikimate pathway. This metabolic pathway is not present in mammals. The mechanism of action of the molecule is not through the inhibition of chorismate synthase but by the inhibition of <b>4-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis.|$|E
50|$|Butamben {{is a local}} anesthetic. It is the ester of <b>4-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> and butanol.A white, odourless, {{crystalline}} powder. that is mildy soluble {{in water}} (1 part in 7000) and soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform, fixed oils, and dilute acids. It slowly hydrolyses when boiled with water. Synonyms include Butamben, Butilaminobenzoato, and Butoforme. Proprietary names includes Alvogil in Spain and Alvogyl in Switzerland. It {{is one of three}} components in the topical anesthetic Cetacaine.|$|E
5000|$|Bentiromide is a peptide {{used as a}} {{screening}} test for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and to monitor the adequacy of supplemental pancreatic therapy. It is given by mouth as a noninvasive test. The amount of <b>4-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> and its metabolites excreted in the urine is taken {{as a measure of}} the chymotrypsin-secreting activity of the pancreas. Headache and gastrointestinal disturbances have been reported in patients taking bentiromide. Bentiromide is not available in the United States or Canada (it was withdrawn in the U.S. in October 1996.) ...|$|E
50|$|Many {{lubricants}} {{are safe}} for anal sex, but there are products that are specifically marketed or designed to enhance enjoyment of anal sex. Often, this is simply a thicker gel rather than a liquid. This thicker consistency is preferable because it helps the lubricant stay in place. Some anal lubricants contain numbing agents to relieve discomfort during anal sex, although it is generally inadvisable {{as a lack of}} sensation makes accidental injury more likely. Additionally, a commonly used numbing agent benzocaine can cause an allergic reaction in those with an allergy to PABA (<b>4-Aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid).</b> Some lubricants are conveniently packaged for ease of application. Many of these products such as Astroglide Shooters have been pulled from the market due to FDA Medical Device Requirements. Products containing benzocaine can numb all body parts with which they come in contact.|$|E
50|$|Desulfobulbus propionicus is an {{anaerobic}} chemoorganotroph. D. propionicus {{uses the}} methylmalony-CoA pathway to ferment 3 moles of pyruvate to 2 moles of acetate and 1 mole of propionate. Desulfobulbus propionicus utilizes propionate, lactate, pyruvate, and alcohols {{from the environment}} as not only electron sources, but for carbon sources as well. Hydrogen gas (H2) is only utilized as an electron donor {{in the presence of}} carbon dioxide and acetate. As assumed by its name, Desulfobulbus propionicus reduces sulfate, sulfite, and thiosulfate to hydrogen sulfide (H2S), but does not reduce elemental sulfur, malate, and fumarate. When sulfate is absent ethanol is fermented to propionate and acetate. In the absence of an electron acceptor, D. propionicus produces sulfate and sulfide from elemental sulfur and water. Also, Desulfobulbus propionicus strains 1pr3T and 3pr10 can only grow in defined minimal media {{with the addition of a}} vitamin <b>4-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> whereas strain 2pr4 does not show this additional requirement. Furthermore, the 2pr4 strain is the only of the three to show growth with butyrate as an electron donor and carbon source, however, the growth is slow compared to other substrates.|$|E
