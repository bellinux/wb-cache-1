500|$|The {{capture of}} Beersheba by the 12th Light Horse Regiment {{has been largely}} written out of history. [...] "The honor and the glory of {{securing}} the town went to the 4th Australian Light Horse in a cavalry charge that in notoriety ranks with the charge of the Light Brigade at Balaklava in 1854." [...] Allenby overlooks the 12th Light Horse Regiment's capture of Beersheba in his report to Wigram intended for the King. According to him, only the 4th Light Horse Regiment, charged and captured the town. [...] "Time was short, and the Brigade Commander, Brigadier–General Grant DSO, sent his leading regiment to charge the trenches. This Regiment, the 4th Light Horse, galloped over the trenches, which were 8 feet deep and <b>4</b> <b>feet</b> <b>wide,</b> and full of Turks. This ended all resistance, and put a neat finish to the battle." [...] His Despatches of 16 December 1917 to the Secretary of State for War, republished in The London Gazette do not identify further, the [...] "Australian Light Horse," [...] be they regiments or brigades.|$|E

50|$|Oregon was 6.5% {{larger and}} <b>4</b> <b>feet</b> <b>wider</b> than Alaska, {{but the same}} length to reduce her ratio of length to beam and address the serious {{vibration}} problem experienced by Arizona and Alaska. Consideration was given to building Oregon of steel after the fisaco of the City of Rome, but the new metal was still expensive and hard to obtain. Oregon was the last iron record breaker. She had nine transverse watertight bulkheads, five iron decks, and a strong turtle-back deck forward and aft as a protection from the heavy seas.|$|R
2500|$|Early {{the next}} morning Forrest arrived at Selma, [...] "horse and rider covered in blood." [...] He advised Gen. Richard Taylor, {{departmental}} commander, to leave the city. Taylor did so after giving Forrest command of the defense. Selma was protected by three miles of fortifications, which ran in a semicircle around the city. They were anchored on {{the north and south}} by the Alabama River. The works had been built two years earlier and, while neglected since then, they were still formidable. The defenses were from 8 to 12 feet high, 15 feet thick at the base, and had a ditch <b>4</b> <b>feet</b> <b>wide</b> and 5 feet deep along the front. Before this was a picket fence of heavy posts planted in the ground, 5 feet high, and sharpened at the top. At prominent positions, earthen forts were built with artillery in position to cover the ground over which an assault would have to be made.|$|E
2500|$|The EMD 16-338 {{developed}} [...] at 1600 rpm. On {{the top was}} an {{air intake}} then four layers of four cylinders each. Each cylinder had a [...] bore and a [...] stroke. On {{the bottom of the}} crank shaft was an Elliot generator which developed 817kW at a maximum of 710 volts DC. This proved problematic as the engine fluids ran down into the generator. The whole engine weighed just over eight tons. Being <b>4</b> <b>feet</b> <b>wide</b> it allowed for four engines in an engine room only [...] long and also allowed design engineers to eliminate a submarine engine room. The [...] and the research submarine [...] used the troublesome EMD 16-338.

50|$|Disc golf {{was first}} invented {{in the early}} 1900s. The first game was held in Bladworth, Saskatchewan, Canada in 1926. Ronald Gibson {{and a group of}} his Bladworth Elementary School buddies played a game of {{throwing}} tin lids into <b>4</b> <b>foot</b> <b>wide</b> circles drawn into sandy patches on their school grounds. They called the game Tin Lid Golf and played on a fairly regular basis. However, after they grew older and went their separate ways, the game came to an end.

50|$|Lambert's corpse rapidly {{began to}} putrefy. There was no {{question}} of his body being returned to Leicester, and so on 22 June, it was placed inside an elm coffin, 6 <b>feet</b> <b>4</b> inches long, <b>4</b> <b>feet</b> <b>4</b> inches <b>wide</b> and 2 <b>feet</b> <b>4</b> inches deep (193 cm × 132 cm × 71 cm), built on wheels {{to allow it to}} be moved. The coffin was so large that to wheel it out of the inn and to the newly opened burial ground at the rear of St Martin's Church, the window and wall of his apartment were demolished. A suitably sized grave had been dug, with a sloping approach to avoid the need to lower the coffin from above, but on 23 June, it nonetheless took almost half an hour for twenty men to pull Lambert's enormous coffin into the grave.|$|R

40|$|A {{full scale}} {{prototype}} flexible radiator panel was designed, built and tested. The panel, has approximately 173 sq ft of radiating area {{and is designed}} to reject 1. 33 kW of heat to a 0 F sink with a 100 F fluid inlet. The panel is constructed from a flexible Teflon/silver mesh fin surrounding 1 / 8 inch Teflon tubes. The prototype panel is stowed on a 10 inch diameter by <b>4</b> <b>foot</b> <b>wide</b> drum. (It rolls up to a diameter of 17 inches when fully stowed). Deployment of the soft tube prototype is via two four inch diameter Kevlar/Mylar inflation tubes with flat springs incorporated in each tube. Nitrogen is normally used for the deployment with approximately 1 psi required. The springs retract the panels when the inflation tubes are deflated. Another method of deployment available for the soft tube flexible is a motor driven deployable boom. This {{eliminates the need for}} expendables when the panel area is varied during the mission for heat load control. The soft tube panel is designed for a 90 % probability of no punctured tube in a 30 day mission. The acceptable working fluids for this soft tube flexible are Coolanol 15, Coolanol 20 and Glycol/water (a eutectic mixture) ...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{expensive}} harvesting practices, a lack {{of local}} growers, and expensive fuel costs, fresh greens such as lettuce and spinach are expensive in Idaho. Local supply decreases during winter off-seasons, increasing transportation costs for greens. The Economic and Natural Resource LLC has concluded {{there is a need}} for an inexpensive, multifunctional prototype that can help local growers to more efficiently produce greens. By producing more greens locally, transportation costs will decrease, and the local economy will be strengthened. Currently, there are no products available small enough for a greenhouse or perform multiple functions for the cost desired. The purpose of this project was to develop an electrically powered prototype with modular attachments which till and level the soil, along with harvest and collect greens. The prototype reduces labor required and increased productivity of harvesting greens. The prototype is powered using rechargeable batteries, able to be operated by a single person, and fits on a standard <b>4</b> <b>foot</b> <b>wide</b> greenhouse bed. The transportable prototype can till soil up to a depth of 7 inches and harvest greens at 6 inches high. The multifunctionality of the prototype will allow for a greater number of greenhouses to make profit off small greens...|$|R
