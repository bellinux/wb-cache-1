25|$|A 30A, <b>4-wire</b> {{single-phase}} grounding socket {{is often}} used for electric clothes dryers. 240 volts from the split phase system {{is used for the}} heating elements, and the motor and controls run on 120 volts. These plugs have blades that are rather larger than NEMA 5-20, are more widely spaced, and are angled so as to prevent using the wrong plug in the wrong circuit. These plugs have L-shaped neutral blades that will not fit in a NEMA 14-50 receptacle.|$|E
25|$|This is a 50A, <b>4-wire</b> {{grounding}} socket usually {{installed in}} kitchens {{and used for}} electric cooking ranges and ovens supplied with 240V by the split phase system. Similar to dryers on 14-30 sockets, these usually have lights, fans, timers, etc., that are run from 120V (obtained {{from one of the}} 120 legs to neutral). Many plug-in electric cars also use this type of socket for recharging in the owner's garage (but in this case neutral is not needed). It is also commonly found in RV parks to provide electricity to recreational vehicles. These plugs have a straight neutral blade that will not fit in a NEMA 14-30 receptacle.|$|E
25|$|SPI {{protocol}} being a {{de facto}} standard, some SPI host adapters also have the ability of supporting other protocols beyond the traditional <b>4-wires</b> SPI (for example, support of quad-SPI protocol or other custom serial protocol that derive from SPI).|$|R
2500|$|For {{three-phase}} at utilization voltages a {{four-wire system}} {{is often used}}. When stepping down three-phase, a transformer with a Delta (3-wire) primary and a Star (<b>4-wire,</b> center-earthed) secondary is often used {{so there is no}} need for a neutral on the supply side. For smaller customers (just how small varies by country and age of the installation) only a single phase and neutral, or two phases and neutral, are taken to the property. For larger installations all three phases and neutral are taken to the main distribution panel. From the three-phase main panel, both single and three-phase circuits may lead off. Three-wire single-phase systems, with a single center-tapped transformer giving two live conductors, is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in North America. This arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as [...] "two phase". A similar method is used for a different reason on construction sites in the UK. Small power tools and lighting are supposed to be supplied by a local center-tapped transformer with a voltage of 55V between each power conductor and earth. This significantly reduces the risk of electric shock in the event that one of the live conductors becomes exposed through an equipment fault whilst still allowing a reasonable voltage of 110V between the two conductors for running the tools.|$|E
5000|$|For example, a <b>4-wire</b> circuit may, {{by means}} of a <b>4-wire</b> {{terminating}} set, be connected to a 2-wire telephone set. Also, a pair of <b>4-wire</b> terminating sets may be used to introduce an intermediate <b>4-wire</b> circuit into a 2-wire circuit, in which loop repeaters may be situated to amplify signals in each direction without positive feedback and oscillation.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>4-wire</b> E&M uses a <b>4-wire</b> (2-pair) {{transmission}} path for the voice signal.2-wire E&M uses a single pair for both transmit and receive voice signal. This is much inferior to <b>4-wire</b> E&M as the 2-wire interface uses hybrid transformers which reduce signal quality and can introduce echo.|$|E

50|$|Some {{datasets}} support full-duplex operation, and full-duplex (<b>4-wire)</b> {{can be used}} in many {{circumstances to}} improve performance by eliminating the turn-around time, at the added expense of <b>4-wire</b> installation and support. In typical full-duplex, data packets are transmitted along one wire pair while the acknowledgements are returned along the other.|$|E
5000|$|Shown {{below are}} the cabling {{arrangements}} for both <b>4-wire</b> and 6-wire cable. Initially <b>4-wire</b> was used and many older installations still use it, then the 6-wire became the new standard, but the <b>4-wire</b> has latterly been reissued to all Openreach engineers {{as part of}} cost savings. Modern <b>4-wire</b> however is the same diameter as 6-wire to allow engineers to retain existing tacking guns and cable clips. Note that the wires in the 6-wire cable are coloured with two colours in a ratio of four to one in length, with the first colour mentioned being the predominant one, e.g. if the indicated colour of the wire is W-B then the wire will be coloured white for 12 mm, then blue for 3 mm and so on. (In other words, {{it looks like a}} white wire with blue patches on it.) ...|$|E

50|$|Extensions are <b>4-Wire</b> hybrids, connect 2 and 5 to A and B on the CCU for {{standard}} analogue extensions and 1 and 6 to C and D for digital extensions. There are no connections to 3 and 4.|$|E
50|$|A Kelvin clip is {{a special}} form of {{crocodile}} clip. The jaws of a Kelvin clip are insulated from each other, allowing 2 isolated wires to connect to a single test point. This enables <b>4-wire</b> measurement of circuits with very low resistances.|$|E

5000|$|Both DataFlash and EEPROM chips can be {{accessed}} from a microcontroller, using a <b>4-wire</b> Serial Peripheral Interface Bus (SPI bus). Both are available in small 8 pin packages. The protocol interfaces are very similar; in both cases, bytes are written or read, via SPI, one or more bytes at a time.|$|E
50|$|The NEMA 14 {{devices are}} <b>4-wire</b> {{grounding}} devices available in ratings of 15-60 A. Of the straight-blade NEMA 14 devices, only the 14-30 and 14-50 are common. The voltage rating is a design maximum of 125/250 V. They are essentially the replacements for the connectors above {{with the addition}} of a separate grounding connection.|$|E
50|$|In the new infrastructure, IRCs were {{connected}} to the UDC in a star network configuration, originally via leased line permanent (not packet switched) connections, based on the X25 protocol, operating at 2.4 kilobits per second (kbit/s). By mid 1981, these private circuit links had been replaced with dedicated <b>4-wire</b> X25 circuits over the new public Packet Switch Stream (PSS) network operating at 4.8 kbit/s.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} voting comparators {{relied on}} a tone encoded on a separate audio path, requiring each receiver site to have a <b>4-wire</b> circuit or two audio paths. The pitch of the tone changed to represent the received signal level, or FM receiver limiter voltage, at the remote receiver. This worked poorly {{because it did not}} account for microwave baseband noise or noisy telephone company circuits.|$|E
50|$|Four-terminal sensing (4T sensing), <b>4-wire</b> sensing, or 4-point probes {{method is}} an {{electrical}} impedance measuring technique that uses separate pairs of current-carrying and voltage-sensing electrodes {{to make more}} accurate measurements than the simpler and more usual two-terminal (2T) sensing. Four-terminal sensing is used in some ohmmeters and impedance analyzers, and in wiring for strain gauges and resistance thermometers. Four-point probes are also used to measure sheet resistance of thin films.|$|E
50|$|When {{both the}} 2-wire and the <b>4-wire</b> {{circuits}} must be balanced, double transformer hybrids are used, as shown at right. Signal into port W splits between X and Z, {{but due to}} reversed connection to the windings, cancel at port Y. Signal into port X goes to W and Y. But due to reversed connection to ports W and Y, Z gets no signal. Thus the pairs, W & Y, X & Z, are conjugates.|$|E
50|$|Benchtop LCR meters {{sometimes}} have selectable test frequencies {{of more than}} 100 kHz. They often include options to superimpose a DC voltage or current on the AC measuring signal. Lower end meters might offer the possibility to externally supply these DC voltages or currents while higher end devices can supply them internally. In addition benchtop meters typically allow the usage of special fixtures (ie, Kelvin wiring, that is to say, <b>4-wire</b> connections) to measure SMD components, air-core coils or transformers.|$|E
50|$|Extenders {{that use}} copper wire include 2- and <b>4-wire</b> {{variants}} using unconditioned copper wiring {{to extend a}} LAN. Network extenders use various methods (line encodings), such as TC-PAM, 2B1Q or DMT, to transmit information. While transmitting over copper wire {{does not allow for}} the speeds that fiber-optic transmission does, it allows the use of existing voice-grade copper or CCTV coaxial cable wiring. Copper-based Ethernet extenders must be used on unconditioned wire (without load coils), such as unused twisted pairs and alarm circuits.|$|E
50|$|Companies and {{individual}} users could connect into the PSS network using the full X.25 interface, via a dedicated four-wire telephone circuit using a PSS analog modem and later on, when problems of 10-100 ms transmission failures with the PCM Voice based transmission equipment {{used by the}} early Kilostream service were resolved, via a Kilostream digital access circuit (actually a baseband modem). In this early 1980s era installation lead times for suitable <b>4-wire</b> analog lines could be more than 6 months in the UK.|$|E
