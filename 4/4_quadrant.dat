40|$|The {{switched}} {{reluctance motor}} (SRM) is receiving attention because of its merits: high operating temperature capability, fault tolerance, inherent shoot-through preventing inverter topology, high power density, high speed operation, and small rotor inertia. Rotor position information plays {{a critical role in}} the control of the SRM. Conventionally, separate position sensors, are used to obtain this information. Position sensors add complexity and cost to the control system and reduce its reliability and flexibility. In order to overcome the drawbacks of position sensors, this dissertation proposed and investigated a position sensorless control system that meets the needs of an electric actuator application. It is capable of working from zero to high speeds. In the control system, two different control strategies are proposed, one for low speeds and one for high speeds.

40|$|The {{development}} of gossamer space {{structures such as}} solar sails and sunshields presents many challenges due to their large size and extreme flexibility. The post-deployment structural geometry exhibited during ground testing may significantly depart from the in-space configuration due {{to the presence of}} gravity-induced deformations (gravity sag) of lightly preloaded membranes. This paper describes a study carried out to characterize gravity sag in two subscale gossamer structures: a single quadrant from a 2 m, <b>4</b> <b>quadrant</b> square solar sail and a 1. 7 m membrane layer from a multi-layer sunshield The behavior of the test articles was studied over a range of preloads and in several orientations with respect to gravity. An experimental study was carried out to measure the global surface profiles using photogrammetry, and nonlinear finite element analysis was used to predict the behavior of the test articles. Comparison of measured and predicted surface profiles shows that the finite dement analysis qualitatively predicts deformed shapes comparable to those observed in the laboratory. Quantitatively, finite element analysis predictions for peak gravity-induced deformations in both test articles were within 10 % of measured values. Results from this study provide increased insight into gravity sag behavior in gossamer structures, and demonstrates the potential to analytically predict gravity-induced deformations to within reasonable accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} {{clinical}} value of optic radiation reconstruction in protecting against visual field deficits (VFDs) in anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL). Methods We retrospectively analyzed 24 patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy undergoing ATL between January 2013 and June 2014. The surgical operations were aided by combining optic radiation reconstruction by diffusion tensor tractography (DTT), microscopy-based neuronavigation and intraoperative MRI (iMRI) techniques. ATL was performed {{according to the}} distance between Meyer's loop and temporal pole. The visual fields were examined and seizure outcomes were evaluated by Engel class test in 3 -month follow-up. Results The optic radiation was reconstructed in all patients. No bleeding was found in operative site or distant site by iMRI scan. The size of removed temporal lobe was 3. 29 cm (1. 90 - 5. 10 cm). Visual field testing 3 months after operation showed no VFDs in 16 cases (66. 67 %) and mild VFDs (< 1 / <b>4</b> <b>quadrant)</b> in 8 cases (33. 33 %). One case suffered mild VFD before operation, but did not aggravate after operation.

Fundus images acquired using Oxymap T 1 were processed using built-in Oxymap Analyzer software. Reproducibility of retinal oximetry was investigated using 20 eyes of 20 healthy subjects. The mean retinal oxygen saturation of <b>4</b> <b>quadrants</b> in healthy Japanese was 97. 0 ± 6. 9 % in arteries and 52. 8 ± 8. 3 % in veins. The mean arteriovenous difference in oxygen saturation was 44. 2 ± 9. 2 %. Both arterial and venous oxygen saturation were significantly lower in the temporal side of the retina, especially in the temporal-inferior vessels. However, the arteriovenous difference in oxygen saturation was limited in the <b>4</b> <b>quadrants.</b> Interphotograph, intervisit, and interevaluator intraclass correlation coefficients were 0. 936 - 0. 979, 0. 809 - 0. 837, and 0. 732 - 0. 947, respectively.

40|$|The Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) {{instrument}} {{is one of}} a handful of extreme adaptive optics systems set to come online in 2014. The extreme adaptive optics correction is realized by a combination of precise wavefront sensing via a non-modulated pyramid wavefront sensor and a 2000 element deformable mirror. This system has recently begun on-sky commissioning and was operated in closed loop for several minutes at a time with a loop speed of 800 Hz, on ~ 150 modes. Further suppression of quasi-static speckles is possible via a process called "speckle nulling" which can create a dark hole in a portion of the frame allowing for an enhancement in contrast, and has been successfully tested on-sky. In addition to the wavefront correction there are a suite of coronagraphs on board to null out the host star which include the phase induced amplitude apodization (PIAA), the vector vortex, 8 octant phase mask, <b>4</b> <b>quadrant</b> phase mask and shaped pupil versions which operate in the NIR (y-K bands).

40|$|Purpose: Patients with zonular weakness, {{undergoing}} cataract surgery, have a {{very high}} risk of the Intraocular Lens (IOL) dislocation during this operation. Strengthening the capsular bag is undeniably important in these patients. In this article, we suggest a novel surgical technique as a prospective treatment for zonular weakness in such patients. Methods: A triangular capsular flap is cut from the anterior capsule with the base directed towards the zonular break area. Basal peripheral iridotomy (PI) is performed in the same zone through corneal paracentesis. The tip of the capsular flap is caught with capsular forcept which is guided through both PI and corneal paracentesis. The tip of the flap is fixed in corneal stroma with a full thickness 10 /O suture. After the lens implantation, the triangular anterior capsular flap is sutured in PIat iris edges and residues of flap in the anterior chamber are cut along the iris plane. Sutures from cornea along with the cut part of the flap are removed. This technique may be more practical in ECCE but {{it is very difficult to}} perform in Phacoemulsification. In this condition, a very tiny iris clip can be used instead of suturing to grasp the capsular flap in PI site and suspend it from the iris. Results: This flap prevents dislocation of bag contents into vitreous and the possibility of vitreous loss through zonular defect and is a reliable support for PC/IOL. We can perform zonuloplasty in one quadrant zonal defect or 2 - 4 quadrants in the cases like Marfan Syndrome. Conclusion: Zonuloplasty is an innovative surgical procedure in cases with zonular instability more than 1 / <b>4</b> <b>quadrant</b> when CTR is ineffective...|$|E

The decrease in bony coverage has shown increased stress on the acetabular labrum as it shares an increased load. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to divide a cohort of patients by radiographic measures of dysplastic and nondysplastic hips for comparison with regard to labral size at 4 anatomic locations. The hypothesis was that dysplastic hips will have significantly larger labral size compared with nondysplastic hips. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A prospective study was conducted at a single institution. A total of 130 patients underwent hip arthroscopy during the study period from September 2011 to February 2012. Intraoperatively, arthroscopic measurements were taken at <b>4</b> <b>quadrants</b> on the acetabular clockface: anterosuperior (12 - 3 o’clock), anteroinferior (3 - 6 o’clock), posterosuperior (9 - 12 o’clock), and posteroinferior (6 - 9 o’clock). Three radiographic parameters for dysplasia were used to substratify the study population base: lateral center-edge angle (LCEA) 25 and LCEA> 25, acetabular inclination (AI) 10 and AI> 10, and anterior center-edge angle (ACEA) 20 and ACEA> 20. Results: For the LCEA 25 group, there were 28 hips with mean LCEA of 20. 96 ± 3. 40. Patients with LCEA 25 had larger labral width in all <b>4</b> <b>quadrants</b> (P 10, there were 12 hips with the mean AI 12. 92 ± 2. 50.

Methods: Anonymized data of 50, 254 patient eyes with diabetes mellitus at 19 UK hospital eye services were extracted at the initial and follow-up visits between 2007 and 2014. Time to progression of PDR and VH were calculated with Cox regression after stratifying by baseline diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity and adjusting for age, gender, race, and starting visual acuity. Results: Progression to PDR in 5 years differed by baseline DR: No DR (2. 2 %), mild (13. 0 %), moderate (27. 2 %), severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (45. 5 %). Similarly, 5 -year progression to VH varied by baseline DR: No DR (1. 1 %), mild (2. 9 %), moderate (7. 3 %), severe NPDR (9. 8 %). Compared to no DR, the patient eyes that presented with mild, moderate, and severe NPDR were 6. 71, 14. 80, and 28. 19 {{times more likely to}} develop PDR, respectively. In comparison to no DR, the eyes with mild, moderate, and severe NPDR were 2. 56, 5. 60, and 7. 29 times more likely to develop VH, respectively.
