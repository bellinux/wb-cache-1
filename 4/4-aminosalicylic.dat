5000|$|... <b>4-Aminosalicylic</b> acid {{was first}} made in 1902 and came into medical use in 1943. It {{is on the}} World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. As of 2005 a course of treatment for tuberculosis costs about 2,700 USD.|$|E
50|$|Orally {{administered}} rifampicin {{results in}} peak plasma concentrations {{in about two}} to four hours. <b>4-Aminosalicylic</b> acid (another antituberculosis drug) significantly reduces absorption of rifampicin, and peak concentrations may be lower. If these two drugs must be used concurrently, they must be given separately, with an interval of eight to 12 hours between administrations.|$|E
5000|$|The niacin {{test strip}} is {{typically}} composed of potassium thiocyanate, chloramine-T, citric acid, and <b>4-Aminosalicylic</b> acid. In {{the presence of}} citric acid, chloramine-T and potassium thiocyanate will react to form cyanogen chloride. This chemical will break apart the pyridine ring of niacin to produce y-carboxy glutaconic aldehyde and joins an aromatic amine to form a yellow color.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>4-Aminosalicylic</b> acid, {{also known}} as {{para-aminosalicylic}} acid (PAS) is an antibiotic primarily used to treat tuberculosis. Specifically {{it is used to}} treat active drug resistant tuberculosis together with other antituberculosis medications. It has also been used as a second line agent to sulfasalazine in people with inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease. It is typically taken by mouth.|$|E

It {{is not recommended}} in people with end stage kidney disease. While there {{does not appear to}} be harm with use during pregnancy it has not been well studied in this population. <b>4-Aminosalicylic</b> acid is believed to work by blocking the ability of bacteria to make folic acid.|$|E
