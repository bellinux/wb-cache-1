40|$|LARC(TradeMark) -SI, Langley Research Center- Soluble Imide, was {{developed}} in 1992, with the first patent issuing in 1997, and then subsequent patents issued in 1998 and 2000. Currently, this polymer has been successfully licensed by NASA, and has generated revenues, {{at the time of}} this reporting, in excess of $ 1. <b>4</b> million. The success of this particular polymer has been due to many factors and many lessons learned to the point that the invention, while important, is the least significant part in the commercialization of this material. Commercial LARC(TradeMark) -SI is a polyimide composed of two molar equivalents of dianhydrides: <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> -oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA), and 3, 3, <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> -biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride (BPDA) and 3, <b>4</b> <b>-oxydianiline</b> (3, <b>4</b> -ODA) as the diamine. The unique feature of this aromatic polyimide is that it remains soluble after solution imidization in high-boiling, polar aprotic solvents, even at solids contents of 50 -percent by weight. However, once isolated and heated above its T(sub g) of 240 C, it becomes insoluble and exhibits high-temperature thermoplastic melt-flow behavior. With these unique structure property characteristics, it was thought this would be an advantage to have an aromatic polyimide that is both solution and melt processable in the imide form. This could potentially lead to lower cost production as it was not as equipment- or labor-intensive as other high-performance polyimide materials that either precipitate or are intractable. This unique combination of properties allowed patents with broad claim coverage and potential commercialization. After the U. S. Patent applications were filed, a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract was awarded to Imtec, Inc. to develop and supply the polyimide to NASA and the general public. Some examples of demonstration parts made with LARC(TradeMark) -SI ranged from aircraft wire and multilayer printed-circuit boards, to gears, composite panels, supported adhesive tape, composite coatings, cookware, and polyimide foam. Even with its unique processing characteristics, the thermal and mechanical properties were not drastically different from other solution or meltprocessable polyimides developed by NASA.

40|$|With the {{development}} of technology for aerospace applications, new thermal insulation materials are required to be flexible and capable of surviving high heat flux. For instance, flexible insulation is needed for inflatable aerodynamic decelerators which are used to slow spacecraft for entry, descent and landing (EDL) operations. Polyimide aerogels have low density, high porosity, high surface area, and better mechanical properties than silica aerogels and can be made into flexible thin films, thus they are potential candidates for aerospace needs. The previously reported cross-linkers such as octa(aminophenyl) silsesquioxane (OAPS) and 1, 3, 5 -triaminophenoxybenzene (TAB) are either expensive or not commercially available. Here, we report the synthesis {{of a series of}} polyimide aerogels cross-linked using various commercially available poly(maleic anhydride) s, as seen in Figure 1.

A matrix effect of a-BPDA/ODA was investigated by comparing with an isomer PI system, s-BPDA/ODA (s-BPDA: 3, 3, 4, 4 -biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride). Neither of the PMDA/PDA-based blend systems with a minor fraction of these flexible PIs showed any distinct glass transitions during dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. The unique fluorescence behavior of perylenete-tracarboxydiimide (PEDI), which became almost non-fluorescent by intimate intermolecular contact with the PMDA/PDA chains, was applied to study the miscibility of the PMDA/PDA-based blend systems. For this purpose, a- and s-BPDA/ODA was labeled by copolymerization using a trace amount of difunc-tional PEDI. The results revealed that the a-BPDA/ODA-containing blend system was miscible over the entire blend composition whereas the s-BPDA/ODA-containing counterpart was essentially immiscible. The a-BPDA/ODA was much more effective as a flexible component than s-BPDA/ODA for reducing the crystallinity of PMDA/PDA and, as a result, significantly improved the film toughness.

Ten days later, they developed eczematous dermatitis at the area of application. Objectives. To investigate whether the dermal application caused active sensitization to <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> '-MDI. Methods. Chemical analysis of the <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> '-MDI preparation used in the application {{and the amount of}} <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> '-MDI not absorbed by the skin was performed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

40|$|Rhodotorula {{gracilis}} metabolizes Chlorobenzilate (ethyl <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> ′-dichlorobenzilate) and Chloropropylate (isopropyl <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> ′-dichlorobenzilate) {{to several}} metabolites in a basal medium supplemented by sucrose and by several intermediates of the citric acid cycle. Three identified metabolites {{resulting from the}} degradation of either acaricide, were <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> ′-dichlorobenzilic acid, <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> ′-dichlorobenzophenone, and carbon dioxide. Chlorobenzilate, i. e., ethyl ester of <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> ′-dichlorobenzilic acid, was more easily hydrolyzed than Chloropropylate, i. e., isopropyl ester of this acid, so that larger amounts {{of carbon dioxide and}} <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> ′-dichlorobenzophenone were obtained from Chlorobenzilate degradation. Regardless of acaricides used, longer incubation caused a higher accumulation of <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> ′-dichlorobenzophenone. The probable steps of the degradation pathway are: Chlorobenzilate (or Chloropropylate) → <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> ′-dichlorobenzilic acid → <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> ′-dichlorobenzophenone plus carbon dioxide.

All of the 17 compounds identified were triterpenoid carotenoids possessing a C 30 chain {{instead of the}} C 40 carotenoid structure found in most other organisms.
