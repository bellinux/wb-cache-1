Recognizing the growing issue of cybersquatting, Congress passed the Anitcybersquatting Consumer Protection Act in 1999, which provided a litigious avenue for dispute resolution. Around the same time, ICANN (the assignor of domain names) adopted the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, which provided an alternative dispute resolution avenue through arbitration.

This distributed state estimator aims at its utilization in the decentralized control, and it is executing in a data communication network which {{is assumed to be}} topologi-cally the same and physically in parallel with the power network. Along with this state estimator, we can obtain several attractive satellite functions which include (1) reduction of the time-skew problem, (2) being free from the power network topological er-ror, (3) easy identification of the unobservable states and (<b>4)</b> <b>bad</b> data detection and identification. We have analyzed the compu-tation complexity of this distributed state estimator. Moreover, we have also simulated this state est,imator on several cases of the IEEE 30 -bus system.

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of {{apartment}} transactions during 2004 – 2006 in Chengdu, China, we investigate the impact of superstitions in the Chinese real estate market. Numerology forms {{an important component of}} Chinese superstitious lore, with the numbers 8 and 6 signifying good luck, and the number <b>4</b> <b>bad</b> luck. We find that secondhand apartments located on floors ending with " 8 " fetch, on average, a 235 RMB higher price (per square meter) than on other floors. For newly constructed apartments, this price premium disappears due to uniform pricing of new housing units, but apartments on floors ending in an " 8 " are sold, on average, 6. 9 days faster than on other floors. Buyers who have a phone number containing more " 8 "’s are more likely to purchase apartments in a floor ending with " 8 "; this suggests that {{at least part of the}} price premium for “lucky” apartments arises from the buyers’ superstitious beliefs...|$|E
40|$|The {{infrared}} {{dynamics of}} generic 3 d N= <b>4</b> <b>bad</b> theories (as per the good-bad-ugly classification of Gaiotto and Witten) are poorly understood. Examples of such theories {{with a single}} unitary gauge group and fundamental flavors have been studied recently, and the low energy effective theory around some special point in the Coulomb branch was shown to have a description {{in terms of a}} good theory and a certain number of free hypermultiplets. A classification of possible infrared fixed points for bad theories by Bashkirov, based on unitarity constraints and superconformal symmetry, suggest a much richer set of possibilities for the IR behavior, although explicit examples were not known. In this note, we present a specific example of a bad quiver gauge theory which admits a good IR description on a sublocus of its Coulomb branch. The good description, in question, consists of two decoupled quiver gauge theories with no free hypermultiplets. Comment: 15 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|Results {{from studies}} of observing {{responses}} have suggested that stimuli maintain observing owing to their special relationship to primary reinforcement (the conditioned-reinforcement hypothesis), and not because they predict the availability and nonavailability of reinforcement (the information hypothesis). The present article first reviews a study that challenges that conclusion and then reports a series of five brief experiments that provide further support for the conditioned-reinforcement view. In Experiments 1 through 3, participants preferred occasional good news (a stimulus correlated with reinforcement) or no news (a stimulus uncorrelated with reinforcement) to occasional bad news (a stimulus negatively correlated with reinforcement). In Experiment <b>4</b> <b>bad</b> news was preferred to no news when the absence of stimulus change following {{a response to the}} bad-news option was reliably associated with good news. When this association was weakened in Experiment 5 the results were intermediate. The results support the conclusion that information is reinforcing only when it is positive or useful.

40|$|The flavour or {{fragrance}} of basmati and jasmine rice {{is associated with}} the presence of 2 -acetyl- 1 -pyrroline. A recessive gene (fgr) on chromosome 8 of rice has been linked to this important trait. Here, we show that a gene with homology to the gene that encodes betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BAD) has significant polymorphisms in the coding region of fragrant genotypes relative to non-fragrant genotypes. The accumulation of 2 -acetyl- 1 -pyrroline in fragrant rice genotypes may be explained by the presence of mutations resulting in a loss of function of the fgr gene product. The allele in fragrant genotypes has a mutation introducing a stop codon upstream of key amino acid sequences conserved in other BADs. The fgr gene corresponds to the gene encoding BAD 2 in rice, while BAD 1 is encoded by a gene on chromosome <b>4.</b> <b>BAD</b> has been linked to stress tolerance in plants. However, the apparent loss of function of BAD 2 does not seem to limit the growth of fragrant rice genotypes. Fragrance in domesticated rice has apparently originated from a common ancestor and may have evolved in a genetically isolated population, or may be the outcome of a separate domestication event. This is an example of effective human selection for a recessive trait during domestication...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} factors {{affecting}} {{the severity of}} motor vehicles traffic crashes involving young drivers in Ontario. POPULATION: Ontario young drivers, aged 16 to 20, involved in traffic crashes resulting in injury, between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 1993, on public roads in Ontario. METHODS: Population based case-control study. Cases were fatal injury, major injury, and minor injury crashes involving young drivers. Controls were minimal injury crashes involving young drivers. Cases and controls were obtained retrospectively from the Canadian Traffic Accident Information Databank. Unconditional logistic regression was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Factors significantly increasing the risk of fatal injury crashes include: drinking and driving (odds ratio (OR) 2. 3), impairment by alcohol (OR 4. 8), exceeding speed limits (OR 2. 8), not using seat belts (OR 4. 7), full ejection from vehicle (OR 21. 3), intersection without traffic control (OR 2. 2), bridge or tunnel (OR 4. 1), road with speed limit 70 - 90 km/hour (OR 5. 6) or 100 km/hour (OR 5. <b>4),</b> <b>bad</b> weather (OR 1. 6), head-on collision (OR 80. 0), and overtaking (OR 1. 9).

CONCLUSIONS: A casual relationship between crash severity and the risk factors listed above was proposed. Risk factors recommended for preventive intervention include: alcohol consumption, speeding, and use of seat belts. Head-on collisions are of primary concern...|$|E
40|$|Background Screw {{fixation}} {{and bone}} grafting are {{the gold standard}} for scaphoid waist nonunion without avascular necrosis. Question/Purpose Assesses the scaphoid waist nonunion healing rate with use of an uncommon cancellous bone graft (olecranon) and an unusual fixation system (Asnis Micro Cannulated Screw System; Stryker Inc., Kalamazoo, MI, USA). Material and Methods A series of 102 consecutive patients were treated for scaphoid waist nonunion (without deformity). Of these, 80 patients subjected to clinical (Modified Mayo Wrist Score (MMWS), Jamar hydraulic dynamometer) and radiographic examination before and after surgery were evaluated. Ipsilateral olecranon cancellous bone graft and the ASNIS Micro 3. 0 -mm diameter screw, were used. The average follow up was 6 years (min 3; max 10). Results Radiographic consolidation was achieved in 90 % of patients; dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI) deformities were corrected in 71. 4 % of cases. Ninety percent improved the range of motion of the wrist and grip strength. All patients showed a significant reduction of peak force in the operated hand. In 6. 25 % we observed clinical and radiographic screw head-trapezium impingement. Twenty-six patients developed a degenerative wrist sign. The MMWS yielded 68 optimal, 8 good, and <b>4</b> <b>bad</b> results. Conclusions To treat scaphoid waist nonunions without misalignment, low-profile headed screw and olecranon bone graft allowed a high consolidation rate with positive results to long-term follow-up.
