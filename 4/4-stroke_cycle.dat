50|$|Hannington Court was {{the third}} ship of the name to sail for the company. Built by Bartram & Sons Ltd, Sunderland and {{launched}} on 19 July 1954, she was completed in December 1954. Measuring , she was 476 ft long, had a beam of 62 ft and a depth of 27 ft. A 6 cylinder <b>4-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> single-acting Burmeister & Wain oil engine drove a single screw, allowing her to make 12.5 kn.|$|E
50|$|Otto {{turned his}} {{attention}} to the <b>4-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> largely due to the efforts of Franz Rings and Herman Schumm, brought into the company by Gottlieb Daimler. It is this engine (the Otto Silent Engine), and not the Otto & Langen engine, to which the Otto cycle refers. This was the first commercially successful engine to use in-cylinder compression (as patented by William Barnett in 1838). The Rings-Schumm engine appeared in autumn 1876 and was immediately successful.|$|E
50|$|An inline six {{engine is}} in {{practically}} perfect {{primary and secondary}} mechanical balance, {{without the use of}} a balance shaft. The engine is in primary couple balance because the front and rear trio of cylinders are mirror images, and the pistons move in pairs (but of course, 360° out of phase and on different strokes of the <b>4-stroke</b> <b>cycle).</b> That is, piston #1 mirrors #6, #2 mirrors #5, and #3 mirrors #4, largely eliminating the polar rocking motion that would otherwise result.|$|E

50|$|The {{ship was}} {{propelled}} by two <b>4-stroke</b> Single <b>Cycle</b> Single Acting diesel engines, which had 6 cylinders of 22+1/16 in diameter by 39+3/8 in stroke. The engines were built by AG Weser.|$|R
5000|$|Otto {{turned his}} {{attention}} to the <b>4-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> which he had failed at in 1862. Largely due to the efforts of Franz Rings and Herman Schumm, who were brought into the company by Gottlieb Daimler Otto succeeds in making the Four Stroke, Compressed Charge engine. It is this engine (the Otto Silent Engine), and not the Otto & Langen engine, to which the [...] "Otto cycle" [...] refers. This was the first commercially successful engine to use in-cylinder compression. The Rings-Schumm engine appeared in autumn 1876 and was immediately successful.|$|E
5000|$|Most engine {{designs that}} pre-dated the Otto engine (and Clerk engine), {{such as those}} of de Rivaz, the Niépce brothers, Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir, Samuel Morey, and others, did use two stroke engines, which were [...] "natural" [...] in the times of steam engine. Clerk's {{significant}} contribution was introducing Otto-styled compression to the two stroke engine, bringing its efficiency up-to-date (for the 1880s). Several manufacturers adopted the Clerk cycle in the short term, though commercial aspects such as patents on the <b>4-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> were part of this. Many years later the 2-stroke engine for large capacity diesels using a turbocharger or supercharger has become common, for example in ships and railway locomotives. With open crankshafts, and the advantages of higher power to weight ratio, these engines are closely aligned with Dugald Clerk's concepts, and the Clerk Cycle.|$|E
50|$|The rotor is {{attached}} {{to the top of the}} distributor shaft which is driven by the engine's camshaft and thus synchronized to it. Synchronization to the camshaft is required as the rotor must turn at exactly half the speed of the main crankshaft in the <b>4-stroke</b> <b>cycle.</b> Often, the rotor and distributor are attached directly to the end of the one of (or the only) camshaft, at the opposite end to the timing drive belt. This rotor is pressed against a carbon brush on the center terminal of the distributor cap which connects to the ignition coil. The rotor is constructed such that the center tab is electrically connected to its outer edge so the current coming in to the center post travels through the carbon point to the outer edge of the rotor. As the camshaft rotates, the rotor spins and its outer edge passes each of the internal plug terminals to fire each spark plug in sequence.|$|E

5000|$|Clerk {{began work}} on his own engine designs in October 1878 after modifying a Brayton engine with a spark plug. George Brayton. Brayton engines ( [...] called [...] "Ready Motors" [...] were made from 1872 - 1876) and {{were one of the}} first engines to {{successfully}} use compression and combust fuel in the cylinder. Prior to this time the commercial engines available had been the Lenoir engine from 1860, a non - compression engine which worked on a double-acting 2-stroke cycle, but spent half of each stroke drawing gas into the cylinder. The Hugon engine was a slightly improved version, but both were quite inefficient (95 and 85 cubic feet of gas per HP hour respectively). The next commercial engine available (from 1867) was the Otto & Langen a non compression, free piston engine, which used atmospheric pressure for the power stroke, and consumed about 1/2 the gas of the Lenoir and Hugon engines. It was in May 1876 that Otto developed his engine using the single-acting <b>4-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> with compression in the cylinder. Clerk decided to develop an engine using compression, but with the 2-stroke cycle, as he could see benefit to weight and smoothness of operation through having twice as many power strokes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lack of an}} {{electrical}} ignition system also reduces the parasitic load on the engine, as the engine {{does not have to}} produce the necessary electricity to ignite the fuel. A significant amount of electricity is required by a spark ignition system, and as engine speeds and loads increase, the ignition system consumes proportionately more electricity, while simultaneously becoming less efficient. Higher cylinder pressure require a [...] "hotter" [...] spark with more current present to overcome the pressure and jump the gap from electrode to electrode in the spark plug. Increased engine speeds and loads also require the spark to occur more rapidly, resulting in additional electrical system loads and demands and more engine power required to meet them. As diesel engine speeds and loads increase, the higher cylinder temperatures after compression of the intake charge result in increased injection and ignition efficiency due to increased fuel atomization. Regardless of fuel system design, a mechanical diesel fuel injection system and rapid rise of fuel pressure and flow will result in injection nozzle opening pressure being reached more rapidly and also earlier in the <b>4-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> with more precise fuel delivery, more precise injection timing and built-in timing advance. Additional power is required to operate the injection system as engine speeds and loads increase, but the increase is more offset than in spark-ignition engines. Modern diesel engines with electronic injection systems use a large amount of electricity for injection, but the ability to precisely time injection and even perform multiple injection events per cycle result in generally increased fuel efficiency compared to mechanically-injected diesel engines of similar size and power.|$|E

50|$|In a {{conventional}} four-stroke engine, {{each of the}} strokes (intake, compression, power, exhaust) involves a nominal rotation of 180°, totaling 720° for the complete <b>4-stroke</b> combustion <b>cycle.</b> A desaxe engine adds to {{the duration of the}} two downward strokes (intake and power), and subtracts the same amount from the two upward strokes (compression and exhaust), with the total remaining 720°. A typical desaxe engine will have strokes of 185° - 175° - 185° - 175°, etc., with the differential roughly (but not directly) proportional to the percentage of offset distance to stroke length.|$|R

Cargo was carried in four holds; the two decks within the hull were primarily for livestock, and could also be used as additional cargo space. The hull of the ship was a 'turret deck' design; decks below the waterline were wider than those above water, and a flat, reinforced hull allowed the ship to rest on the bottom.
