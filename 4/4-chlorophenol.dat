50|$|Various Arthrobacter {{species have}} been {{investigated}} for other commercial applications. A. crystallopoietes and A. chlorophenolicus {{have been shown to}} reduce hexavalent chromium and <b>4-chlorophenol</b> levels in contaminated soil, suggesting they may be useful for bioremediation. Similarly, Arthrobacter sp. strain R1 (American Type Culture Collection strain number 49987) has been shown to grow on a variety of aromatic compounds, including homocyclic compounds, such as hydroxybenzoates, as well as N-heterocycles, including pyridine and picoline.|$|E
