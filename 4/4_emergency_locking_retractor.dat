50|$|The Japanese {{vehicles}} had rear lap belts only on {{the lower}} trim levels and 3-point outboard position lap and shoulder belts with a center rear position lap belt on all vehicles with the 2.0-liter engine. Seat belt pre-tensioners with <b>Emergency</b> <b>Locking</b> <b>Retractors</b> (called E.L.R.) were standard equipment in Japanese vehicles with the VZ trim package and all vehicles equipped with the turbocharged engine.|$|R
50|$|The third safety {{advancement}} was {{the introduction}} of dual front lap-and-shoulder safety belts with <b>emergency</b> <b>locking</b> <b>retractors</b> for outboard occupants in 1975 for the 1976 model year. These replaced the outdated and inadequate lap belts previously used. A center lap safety belt with slack adjustment was provided for the center occupant. Ford and Dodge would follow one model year later adding lap-and-shoulder safety belts to their pickups.|$|R
5000|$|Items {{that were}} {{optional}} on the Accord, such as cruise control, air conditioning with automatic fan speed control and thermostatically monitored temperature, power windows with driver's one touch express down, and power steering were standard on the Vigor. A trip computer that displayed mileage, driving time, and fuel economy that Honda called in sales brochure literature as [...] "Electronic Navigator" [...] was also standard on the Vigor. All Vigors were also equipped with ELR (<b>Emergency</b> <b>Locking</b> <b>Retractor)</b> seatbelts. One of the optional {{items on the}} Vigor was an Electro Gyrocator, the world's first automatic in-car navigation system. Other items included digital instrumentation, four-wheel Anti-lock brakes, a choice of stereo systems from Alpine Electronics, Clarion, and Pioneer, alloy wheels (13-inch), and adjustable thigh support on the front passenger seat.|$|R
5000|$|The Legend offered many Honda [...] "firsts", such as {{a driver}} side airbag, vehicle speed {{sensitive}} power assist rack and pinon steering, anti-lock brakes, seat belt pre-tensioners with <b>Emergency</b> <b>Locking</b> <b>Retractors</b> (called E.L.R.), a choice of 100% wool or cloth moquette upholstery, and [...] "TCS" [...] Traction control, the first car to use traction control on a front wheel drive vehicle. Attention was given {{to make sure the}} Legend was quiet, so Honda used computer simulation using NASTRAN, a stress analysis program created by NASA, helping the car achieve a drag coefficient of 0.32 and an interior noise level of 63 dB (measured while the vehicle was travelling at 100 km/h using a manual transmission in 5th gear), and by using triple seals around the tops of door openings.|$|R
50|$|A two air bag {{supplementary}} {{restraint system}} (SRS) with 2-way occupant protection was standard. The air bags would adjust deployment force depending on crash severity. Features included SecuriLock with smart key and engine immobilizer, security approach lamps, four-wheel {{anti-lock braking system}} (ABS), side-intrusion door beams, post-crash fuel pump shut-off and three-point safety belts for all rows of seating with tension and <b>locking</b> <b>retractors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Violence {{and threats}} {{are a common}} {{occurrence}} at the hospital's emergency room in Malmö and therefore guards are employed on a 24hr basis, and <b>emergency</b> <b>lock</b> down has been installed along with security cameras. All employees have been given training in self-defence and wear alarms in case they are attacked. The <b>emergency</b> <b>lock</b> down {{makes it impossible for}} threatening people outside the building to enter the premises. The reason for these measures is an upsurge in aggressive patients with drug problems and a society where levels of violence are on the rise due to the level of organised crime using lethal violence based in Malmö. In March 2017 the <b>emergency</b> room started <b>locking</b> its door between 2100-0500 {{to reduce the number of}} violent incidents involving people who sought to meet or get information about patients.|$|R
50|$|A vehicle-sensitive lock {{is based}} on a {{pendulum}} swung away from its plumb position by rapid deceleration or rollover of the vehicle. In the absence of rapid deceleration or rollover, the reel is unlocked and the belt strap may be pulled from the reel against the spring tension of the reel. The vehicle occupant can move around with relative freedom while the spring tension of the reel keeps the belt taut against the occupant. When the pendulum swings away from its normal plumb position due to sudden deceleration or rollover, a pawl is engaged, the reel locks and the strap restrains the belted occupant in position. Dual-sensing <b>locking</b> <b>retractors</b> use both vehicle G-loading and webbing payout rate to initiate the locking mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>locking</b> <b>retractors</b> {{is to provide}} the seated {{occupant}} the convenience of some free movement of the upper torso within the compartment, while providing a method of limiting this movement {{in the event of}} a crash. Most modern seat belts are stowed on spring-loaded reels called [...] "retractors" [...] equipped with inertial locking mechanisms that stop the belt from extending off the reel during severe deceleration. There are two main types of inertial seat belt lock. A webbing-sensitive lock is based on a centrifugal clutch activated by rapid acceleration of the strap (webbing) from the reel. The belt can be pulled from the reel only slowly and gradually, as when the occupant extends the belt to fasten it. A sudden rapid pull of the belt—as in a sudden braking or collision event—causes the reel to lock, restraining the occupant in position.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The MADYMO {{simulation}} {{model of the}} rear occupant restraint system based a current car model was constructed, researching {{the influence of the}} rear seat cushion stiffness and cushion angle with the floor, the 3 -point seatbelt webbing stiffness and <b>retractor</b> <b>locking</b> feature on rear-seat passenger safety in the head-on collision. Thereafter, the entire rear occupant restraint system was optimised. The result shows when the rear seat cushion stiffness is 30 N/mm, the cushion angle is 25 °, the safety belt stiffness is 11 % and the webbing output after the <b>retractor</b> <b>locks</b> is 30 mm, rear occupant would obtain the optimum protection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} injury values rear seat {{occupants}} sustain in the frontal collision, this paper constructed the simulation {{model of the}} rear occupant restraint system of a vehicle model using MADYMO software. The influence of the rear 3 -point seatbelt stiffness and <b>retractor</b> <b>locking</b> feature, the rear seat cushion stiffness and angle with the vehicle floor on head injury criterion HIC 36, thorax 3 ms resultant acceleration T 3 MS, thorax performance criterion THPC, left and right femur force of rear occupants were analysed through the simulation model. The conclusion shows that HIC 36 drops when the seatbelt stiffness increases and <b>retractor</b> <b>locking</b> feature decreases compared to the original values; HIC 36, T 3 MS, left and right femur force become less when the seat cushion stiffness decreases and angle increases compared to the original values...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes an <b>emergency</b> <b>locking</b> unit (ELU) for a {{seat belt}} {{retractor}} which is mounted on the back frame of a vehicle seat. The proposed unit uses a recliner sensor based on a MEMS acceleration sensor and solenoid mechanism. The seat has an upper frame supported to tilt on a lower frame. The retractor in belt in seat (BIS) system is supported by the upper frame. The proposed recliner sensor based on a MEMS acceleration sensor comprises orientation means for maintaining a predetermined orientation of emergency relative to the lower frame independently of the force of gravity when the upper frame tilts on the lower frame. Experimental results show that the developed recliner sensor unit operates effectively with respect to rollover angles. Thus, the developed unit will have a considerable potential to offer a new design concept in BIS system...|$|R
50|$|The Mannlicher-Schönauer rifle was one {{of these}} novel designs. The rifle action was {{designed}} by Ferdinand Mannlicher and the rotary magazine by his protegee Otto Schönauer of the Österreichische Waffenfabriksgesellschaft (Austrian Arms-Manufacturing Company; now Steyr Mannlicher). While the more famous Mannlicher M1895 used the less common straight-pull bolt, the Mannlicher-Schönauer had a conventional turn-bolt, more reminiscent of the Gewehr 88 and other typical military bolt-action rifles. At first sight many confuse it with a Mauser rifle, due to the similar bolt and handguards. The Mannlicher-Schönauer may be identified by the split {{in the rear of the}} receiver which allows the bolt handle to pass through, and double as an <b>emergency</b> <b>locking</b> lug when closed, in case of failure of the primary locking lugs. The characteristic that sets this design apart from others of the era though was the innovative Schönauer rotating spool magazine.|$|R
