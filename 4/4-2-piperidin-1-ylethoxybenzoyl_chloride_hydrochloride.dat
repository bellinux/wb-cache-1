This comprises repeating units of β-d-glucopyranose, covalently linked with OH group of C 4 and C 1 carbon atoms [26 – 28]. Naturally occurring cellulose shows less adsorption capacity and physical stability due to the steric hindrance offered by three hydroxyl groups with the same ring. Moreover, these hydroxyl moieties are chemically unreactive as the polymer matrix contains crystalline regions [27, 29]. In order to develop adsorption capacity and structural stability of natural cellulose, modifications were employed in the matrix by means of chemical reactions, such as halogenation, etherification, esterification, and oxidation. Such modified matrices were found to be capable of separating heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions [27]. The cellulose beads when treated mainly with 2 -(diethylamino) ethyl <b>chloride</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> along with some other treatments produced diethylaminoethyl cellulose [30].

However, the metabolism of these compounds by trypanosomes has not been reported. Indeed, it is not known whether or not their metabolism by the parasite contributes to their activity, selective toxicity for these parasites or to the development of chemoresistance. Therefore, we studied the metabolism of EBr and ISM, and their distribution in Trypanosoma brucei (TREU 927) using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Incubation of EBr with trypanosomes {{led to the formation of}} a small amount (0. 606 ± 0. 191 %) of one metabolite (MI). Ion chromatograms extracted from an LC-MS analysis using electrospray ionisation (ESI), showed that the difference in mass between the parent compound and its metabolite was 30. This may correspond to the addition of a hydroxyl and a methyl group. No metabolites could be detected for ISM. The distribution of the two drugs in trypanosomes was investigated by CLSM, using their intrinsic fluorescence. ISM and EBr showed differences in their distribution in trypanosomes. ISM had a greater affinity for the kinetoplast than EBr and it stained other organelles like the flagellum; in contrast the distribution of EBr was more diffuse...|$|R
