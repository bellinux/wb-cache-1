40|$|Ceramic {{composite}} tubes can be fabricated with {{silicon carbide}} matrix and Nicalon fiber reinforcement using forced flow-thermal gradient chemical vapor infiltration (FCVI). The process model GTCVI {{is used to}} design the equipment configuration and to identify conditions for rapid, uniform densification. The initial injector and mandrel design produced radial and longitudinal temperature gradients too large for uniform densification. Improved designs have been evaluated with the model. The most favorable approach utilizes a free-standing preform and an insulated water-cooled gas injector. Selected process conditions {{are based on the}} temperature limit of the fiber, matrix stoichiometry and reagent utilization efficiency. Model runs for a tube 12 inches long, 4 inches OD and 1 / <b>4</b> <b>inch</b> <b>wall</b> thickness show uniform densification in approximately 15 hours...|$|E

Across the narrow dimension of the field a <b>4</b> <b>inch</b> high <b>wall,</b> along which are placed three tilting bridges at a height of 12 inches.

The <b>walls</b> are not straight, nor the floor level. The side aisles have not been begun, and altogether no part of the interior is quite finished, except {{the upper part of the}} dagoba. To the top of the architrave or triforium is 16 feet, and to the centre of the roof 18 feet 2 inches. Outside, the façade is carved with Chaitya [...] window ornaments, some enclosing a dagoba, and others a lotus flower; while the rail ornament is abundantly interspersed in the usual way. The fronton round the window is also carved with a geometrical pattern. The details of this cave seem to indicate that it is perhaps as early as those at Bedsa and Karle, and consequently it is among the earlier excavations about Junnar.|$|R

40|$|The Size Reduction Machine (SRM) is {{a mobile}} {{platform}} capable of shearing various shapes {{and types of}} metal components {{at a variety of}} elevations. This shearing activity can be performed without direct physical movement and placement of the shear head by the operator. The base unit is manually moved and roughly aligned to each cut location. The base contains the electronics: hydraulic pumps, servos, and actuators needed to move the shear-positioning arm. The movable arm allows the shear head to have six axes of movement and to cut to within <b>4</b> <b>inches</b> of a <b>wall</b> surface. The unit has a slick electrostatic capture coating to assist in external decontamination. Internal contamination of the unit is controlled by a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter on the cooling inlet fan. The unit is compact enough to access areas through a 36 -inch standard door opening.

40|$|Abstract. A <b>4</b> <b>inch</b> {{drill pipe}} {{assembly}} {{has been developed}} {{that can be used}} for drilling 6 inch diameter holes. Normally, 6 inch diameter holes are drilled with 3 - 1 / 2 <b>inch</b> pipe with <b>4</b> - 3 / <b>4</b> <b>inch</b> OD tool joints because the tool joints for <b>4</b> <b>inch</b> pipe are too large. In most cases, the pipe size is based on the strength balance between the pipe and tool joint and 5 inch or 5 - 1 / <b>4</b> <b>inch</b> OD tool joints are usually welded to <b>4</b> <b>inch</b> pipe. A 5 inch OD tool joint is too large for an overshot in a 6 inch diameter hole. A <b>4</b> <b>inch</b> drill pipe assembly with a 4 - 3 / <b>4</b> <b>inch</b> OD tool joint has been developed that can be used in 6 inch diameter holes. Four inch pipe has a number of advantages over 3 - 1 / 2 inch pipe such as more torsional and tensile strength and improved hydraulics. Less pump flow is required for the same annular velocity and there is a lower pressure loss in the pipe. This paper will discuss:! The pipe development program. ! The results of finite element analysis on the tool joint. ! Full-scale lab testing of the tool joint. ! Case histories of similar assemblies. Drill String Design. The design of a drill string or selection of drill pipe size, weight and grade is based on three parameters...|$|R
