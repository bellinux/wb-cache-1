A passenger information office and lounge are above the subway, the British Transport Police office and cycle racks are beyond, and at the western end is Platform <b>4,</b> <b>used</b> by only a few trains. Alongside this is Platform 2, another bay platform but not signalled for passenger trains and used only for stabling empty trains, as is the former Motorail unloading bay alongside. At the far end of this track is the old Fish Dock, occasionally used for stabling engineers' on-track equipment. Beyond the end of the platform the tracks swing to the right (the west) and pass out of sight beneath Bath Road Bridge, a girder bridge that carries the A4 out of the city.|$|E

25|$|The BBC {{made some}} {{use of its}} {{multiplex}} for three of its then four new television services; BBC Choice (which had started on 23 September 1998 with four national variations), BBC News 24 and BBC Parliament (albeit in sound only). ITV initially used their space to house ITV2 (from 7 December 1998) in England and Wales, You2 (later UTV2) in Northern Ireland and S2 in Scotland (now both ITV2), as well as GMTV2 during the early mornings. Channel <b>4</b> <b>used</b> their space for subscription channels FilmFour and E4 which, although not part of ONdigital, would be paid for and were only available through an ONdigital subscription. Channel 4's nationwide coverage on 'mux' 2 enabled it to be received terrestrially throughout much of Wales {{for the first time}} in its history, where previously only S4C had been available. Consequently, S4C's digital service, 'S4C Digidol' carries only Welsh-language programming, in contrast to S4C analogue which also carries English-language programmes commissioned and transmitted by Channel 4 in other parts of the UK.|$|E

To gain insight in the {{transition}} from CCR 5 to CXCR <b>4</b> coreceptor <b>use,</b> we investigated whether acquisition of CXCR <b>4</b> <b>use</b> in vitro of R 5 viruses from four patients resembled this process in vivo. R 5 variants from only one patient acquired CXCR <b>4</b> <b>use</b> in vitro. These variants had envelopes with higher V 3 charge and higher number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites when compared to R 5 variants that failed to gain CXCR <b>4</b> <b>use</b> in vitro. In this patient, acquisition of CXCR <b>4</b> <b>use</b> in vitro and in vivo was associated with multiple mutational patterns not necessarily involving the V 3 region. However, changes at specific V 3 positions were prerequisite for persistence of CXCR 4 -using variants in vivo, suggesting that positive selection targeting the V 3 loop is required for emergence of CXCR 4 -using variants during natural disease course...|$|R
