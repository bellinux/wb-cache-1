2500|$|Unlike races {{such as the}} TT Formulae, or Moto-Cross, {{where two}} and four strokes had {{different}} engine size limits in the same class, until 2002 GP racing set the upper limit the same for both types of engines in all its classes. After that, MotoGP gave the four-strokes a 490cc advantage over the two-strokes. A 2 stroke engine produces power with every rotation of the crank, where as the <b>4</b> <b>stroke</b> engine produces power every second rotation. In theory, a 500cc 2stroke produces the same power as a 1000cc <b>4</b> <b>stroke,</b> however there are many {{differences between the two}} configurations. Carburation vs fuel injection, engine mapping, power/torque curves, and throttle response are a few major differences.|$|E
