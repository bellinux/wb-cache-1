25|$|A {{total of}} 463 {{aircraft}} were produced. A single prototype of a turbocharged development mounting a <b>4-blade</b> <b>propeller</b> was built; this {{was called the}} C6N2 Saiun-kai. A night-fighter version C6N1-S with oblique-firing (Schräge Musik configuration) single 30mm (or dual 20mm) cannon and a torpedo carrying C6N1-B were also developed. The C6N1-B developed by Nakajima was not needed after Japan's aircraft carriers were destroyed. As Allied bombers came within reach of the Japanese home islands, there became {{a need for a}} first class night fighter. This led Nakajima to develop the C6N1-S by removing the observer and replacing him with two 20mm cannons. The C6N1-S's effectiveness was hampered by the lack of air-to-air radar, although it was fast enough to enjoy almost complete immunity from interception by Allied fighters.|$|E
2500|$|This {{design was}} {{approved}} by the Koku Hombu, and the aircraft was designated Ki-94-II (the scrapped earlier Ki-94 design was named the Ki-94-I). An order was placed for one static test airframe, three prototypes, and eighteen pre-production aircraft. [...] Only 2 prototypes were built in the event; the first was equipped with a single [...] Nakajima Ha219 [...] engine, driving a <b>4-blade</b> <b>propeller</b> because the 6-blade one was not ready. The second prototype was to be fitted with a 6-blade propeller. The war's end however stopped the construction of the second prototype and also found the first prototype still being readied for its maiden flight, the Ki-94-II never taking to the air.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{of the two}} {{propulsion}} systems consisted of modified Ford 2.3 liter engines, reduction gearbox, and <b>4-blade</b> <b>propeller.</b> The engines were originally designed for use with some models of the petrol-burning Ford Fusion car. To {{be able to run}} in the oxygen starved atmosphere at 65,000 ft, the engines featured a multiple turbocharger system that compresses that available low density air and reduces the radiated infrared heat signature to increase its stealth properties. The engines, which provided 150 horsepower at sea level, were tuned so as to be able to run on hydrogen. Boeing's marketing department stated that this will make the aircraft economical and [...] "green" [...] to run, as the only by-product would be water.|$|E

5000|$|The engine {{developed}} for Avion II, called Zéphyr {{was a light}} steam engine driving a 3 m diameter <b>4-bladed</b> <b>propeller,</b> in which steam was cooled through a condenser.

Single-tail design, {{and having a}} longer hull with fewer bulkheads and a larger maximum take-off weight. It had also been fitted with equipment for overhead cargo handling and was powered by four Wright R-3350-24WA Cyclone engines with <b>4-bladed</b> <b>propellers,</b> five built, surviving four converted to JRM-3.|$|R

50|$|Three more prototypes were ordered, two D.IIc's with {{shorter and}} longer span wings and the D.IIe, with the {{original}} sized wings. After completion in October 1917, the design proved promising and in December an order for twenty long-span D.IIc's was placed with a smaller <b>4-bladed</b> <b>propeller,</b> that allowed for shorter landing gear legs. These aircraft, now known as D.III, started delivery in January and were followed by an order for thirty more in February.|$|R
5000|$|The {{airframe}} {{was constructed}} of composite materials, carbon fiber and Kevlar. This {{resulted in a}} very light, strong aircraft.

The engines were originally developed for auto racing and were turbocharged to produce [...] However, those fitted to the Pond Racer only ever achieved a peak of around [...] The engines drove <b>4-bladed</b> <b>propellers</b> via propeller speed reduction units.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first was}} a twin-boom {{monoplane}} with two [...] Mitsubishi Ha211 18-cylinder engines, driving two <b>4-blade</b> <b>propellers</b> in a push-pull configuration. [...] The very heavy armament {{that should have been}} mounted on the aircraft (two 37mm/1.46in and two 30mm/1.18in cannons, should have been enough to make short work of most US heavy bombers of the era. Notwithstanding the outstanding prospective performance, which however was judged as [...] "unduly optimistic" [...] by the technical department of the Japanese Army Air Force, this design was judged too complex by the technical department and the design was discarded.|$|R
5000|$|The Welfreighter {{outwardly}} {{resembled a}} conventional 37 ft motor boat. While surfaced it was propelled by a Gardner 4LW [...] diesel omnibus engine driving a <b>4-bladed</b> <b>propeller,</b> while underwater propulsion {{was provided by}} two [...] electric motors, driving a pair of small propellers. Two [...] "masts" [...] on the craft's foredeck housed a Barr and Stroude periscope and a magnetic compass. A dummy mast and sail could be attached to these masts to help disguise the craft as a fishing smack. The foredeck was raised up to give some headroom inside the craft, and was fitted with small square viewports.|$|R

5000|$|... 1) Used in post-war {{service by}} several navies with {{different}} modifications and designations (Marina Española: G-7a, Bundesmarine: DM11, Royal Danish Navy: T1T, Royal Norwegian Navy: T1 mod 1).

T1 mod 1 was used from FACs (until 1992), submarines (the 1980s) and Coastal artillery shore-batteries (1999).2) 44kn was {{to be used by}} S-Boote (problems with initial design lead to breakdown on motors running 44 kn, so this setting was banned until the new engine was available)3) Black used only from shore torpedobatteries, red from surfacevessels and blue from submarines4) Early versions had <b>4-blade</b> <b>propellers</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Both {{versions}} of the CycloCrane were 178 ft (54.25 m) long. The first version, completed in 1982 had four piston engines and was fitted with a large, inverted Y shaped tail needed to stabilise it at its moorings by keeping it pointed into wind. That version was destroyed at its moorings in a storm and was never flown. It was rebuilt by 1984 and fitted with an 18 faceted, ring shaped tail wire braced to the central axis. The aerostats in both versions were 68 ft 0 in (20.73 m) in diameter and 136 ft 0 in (41.45 m) long and manufactured by ILC Dover of Frederica, Delaware, USA. Partly to save weight, this version had only two engines, a pair of 150 hp (112 kW) Textron Lycoming AEIO-320 horizontally opposed piston engines driving <b>4-bladed</b> <b>propellers.</b> This left the CycloCrane rather underpowered, particularly in lift.|$|R
5000|$|The {{class is}} fitted with twin Caterpillar 3516B DI-TA Elec engines driving twin <b>4-bladed</b> controllable-pitch <b>propellers</b> through {{a pair of}} 3.5:1 {{reduction}} gearboxes. The total installed power of [...] gives them {{a top speed of}} 26 kn. A single Promac bow thruster is fitted for slow speed manoeuvring in confined spaces. Electrical power is supplied by a pair of 106 kVA generators.|$|R
50|$|The Ryan XF2R Dark Shark was an {{experimental}} aircraft {{built for the}} United States Navy that combined turboprop and turbojet propulsion. It was based on Ryan Aeronautical's earlier FR Fireball, but replaced the Fireball's piston engine with a General Electric T31 turboprop engine driving a <b>4-bladed</b> Hamilton Standard <b>propeller.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There is {{a choice}} of two very compact D-Motor engines (both liquid-cooled {{horizontally}} opposed side-valve four-strokes): either the [...] 4-cylinder LF26 or the [...] 6-cylinder LF39. The engine is sited behind the cockpit, driving a 3- or <b>4-bladed</b> ground-adjustable pusher <b>propeller.</b> Although D-Motor engines are direct-drive units with no gearbox, on the Lightning {{there appears to be}} a reduction system using belt drive.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship has}} a {{diesel-electric}} powertrain that uses three Azipod azimuth thrusters. Each propeller {{is driven by}} a double-wound 3-phase synchronous motor with <b>4-bladed</b> fixed-pitch bronze <b>propellers.</b> The motors are mounted outside the hull directly on the propeller shaft inside the pod. The three propellers are arranged so that the center propeller is a pushing on-azimuthing Fixipod-type and the two wing ones are of pulling-azimuthing-type steering propellers.|$|R
