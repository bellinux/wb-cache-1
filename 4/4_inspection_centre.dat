The automatic detection capability was to be achieved by specific high-resolution sensors and intelligent data processing including data fusion. This prototype system was implemented {{during the period from}} August 1991 through January 1994.

How dynamic statistical process control rules can improve on traditional, static ones is described. Numerical examples are explored and 9 opportunities for improvement are identified. Opportunities for improvement include: 1. Cancel some of the inspections called for by an optimal static rule when starting in control. 2. Inspect more frequently than called for by an optimal static rule once inspections begin, and inspect even more frequently than that when negative evidence is accumulated. 3. Utilize evidence from previous inspections to justify either restoration or another <b>inspection.</b> <b>4.</b> Cancel <b>inspections</b> and hesitate to restore the process {{at the end of}} a production run. 5.
