5|$|In the US and Canada, nine {{variations}} of the third-generation iPad were offered, compared to six {{in the rest of}} the world, although some countries had only the Wi-Fi only model. Each variation was available with black or white front glass panels, with options for 16, 32, or 64GB of storage. In North America, connectivity options were Wi-Fi only, Wi-Fi + <b>4G</b> (<b>LTE)</b> on Verizon, AT, Telus, Rogers, or Bell. For the rest of the world outside North America, connectivity options are Wi-Fi only (on the Wi-Fi model) or Wi-Fi + 3G (on the Wi-Fi + Cellular model), with the latter unavailable in some countries, as <b>4G</b> (<b>LTE)</b> connectivity for the device is not available outside North America. The Wi-Fi + Cellular model includes GPS capability.|$|E

A month later, on June 21, 2012, Apple was sued for A$2.25 million for false advertising in Australia. In its advertisements Apple claimed that the new iPad was <b>4G</b> <b>LTE</b> compatible.

5|$|The SIII {{comes in}} two {{distinct}} variations that differ {{primarily in the}} internal hardware. The international SIII version has Samsung's Exynos 4 Quad {{system on a chip}} (SoC) containing a 1.4GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 central processing unit (CPU) and an ARM Mali-400 MP graphics processing unit (GPU). According to Samsung, the Exynos 4 Quad doubles the performance of the Exynos 4 Dual used on the SII, while using 20percent less power. Samsung had also released several <b>4G</b> <b>LTE</b> versions—4G facilitates higher-speed mobile connection compared to 3G—in selected countries to exploit the corresponding communications infrastructures that exist in those markets. Most of these versions use Qualcomm's Snapdragon S4 SoC featuring a dual-core 1.5GHz Krait CPU and an Adreno 225 GPU. The South Korean and Australian versions are a hybrid of the international and 4G-capable versions.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} seven {{versions}} of the iPad. The first generation established design precedents, some of which, such as the home button placement, have persisted through all models. The 2nd-generation iPad (iPad 2) introduced a new thinner design, a dual-core Apple A5 processor, and VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling. The third generation added a Retina Display, the new Apple A5X processor with a quad-core graphics processor, a 5-megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation, and <b>4G</b> (<b>LTE).</b> The fourth generation added the Apple A6X processor and replaced the 30-pin connector with an all-digital Lightning connector. The iPad Air added the Apple A7 processor and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness {{for the first time}} since the iPad 2. The iPad Air 2 added the Apple A8X processor, the Apple M8 motion coprocessor, an 8-megapixel camera, and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; and further reduced the thickness. The iPad introduced in 2017 added the Apple A9 processor, while sacrificing some of the improvements the iPad Air 2 introduced in exchange for a lower launch price.|$|E

During the same period, poverty has dropped from 15.2% to 7.6%, {{unemployment}} rate has dropped from 7.2% to 4.9%, market capitalisation of Colombo Stock Exchange has quadrupled and budget deficit has doubled. Over 90% of the households in Sri Lanka are electrified. 87.3% of the population have access to safe drinking water and 39% have access to pipe-borne water. Income inequality has also dropped in recent years, indicated by a gini coefficient of 0.36 in 2010. Sri Lanka's cellular subscriber base has shown a staggering 550% growth, from 2005 to 2010.

25|$|MediaTek started {{shipping}} SoC solutions with integrated <b>4G</b> <b>LTE</b> baseband {{in volume}} {{in the second}} half of 2014, which was later than Qualcomm, which had been shipping SoCs with integrated 4G for some time, which was likely to impact MediaTek as Chinese telecom providers such as China Mobile and carriers in other countries push and subsidize LTE technology. Although MediaTek's MT6290 stand-alone 4G baseband combined with its MT6582 or MT6592 SoCs is less profitable for MediaTek than a single-chip 4G solution would be, as of mid-2014 they have been adopted in some models by large manufacturers. However, the first generation of new affordable 4G smartphone models from large MediaTek clients such as Alcatel One Touch and ZTE use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 400 and 410 platforms with integrated 4G baseband. MediaTek has indicated that chips with 4G were expected to make up 20% of shipments in Q4 2014, with a significant increase expected for 2015, which will also see improvements to its product mix as new 4G chips allow it to target higher market segments.|$|E
