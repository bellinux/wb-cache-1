40|$|This study {{provides}} for development and test verification of a thermal model used for prediction of joint heating environments, structural temperatures and seal erosions in the Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) Nozzle Joint- 4. The heating environments {{are a result}} of rapid pressurization of the joint free volume assuming a leak path has occurred in the filler material used for assembly gap close out. Combustion gases flow along the leak path from nozzle environment to joint O-ring gland resulting in local heating to the metal housing and erosion of seal materials. Analysis of this condition was based on usage of the NASA Joint Pressurization Routine (JPR) for environment determination and the Systems Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer (SINDA) for structural temperature prediction. Model generated temperatures, pressures and seal erosions are compared to hot fire test data for several different leak path situations. Investigated in the hot fire test program were nozzle joint- <b>4</b> <b>O-ring</b> erosion sensitivities to leak path width in both open and confined joint geometries. Model predictions were in generally good agreement with the test data for the confined leak path cases. Worst case flight predictions are provided using the test-calibrated model. Analysis issues are discussed based on model calibration procedures...|$|E
40|$|Statement of the Problem: Implant-retained overdenture {{can improve}} the {{stability}} of dentures and prevent bone loss. Overdenture-wearing patients need special hygiene care. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of various denture cleansers on the retention of Dio orange O-rings. Method and Materials: In this experimental study, 40 Dio orange O-rings were divided into <b>4</b> groups (10 <b>O-rings</b> each) and each group was soaked for equiva-lent of 6 months in the following solutions: 5. 25...|$|R
