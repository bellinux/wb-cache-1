They created a high-quality, open-source 8-channel EEG acquisition board, known as the 32bit Board, that retailed for under $500.

25|$|The Legacy {{began with}} a 5-door wagon or 4-door sedan body styles with FWD and an {{optional}} full-time AWD package, and was introduced in North America, the UK, Germany, the Benelux region of Northern Europe, Japan and Australia. Options included <b>4-channel</b> ABS, licensed from Bosch and air suspension height control, which lowered the vehicle at speeds above , and also allowed the driver to increase the vehicle's ground clearance for off-road conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{drive train}} {{delivered}} power to all four wheels using an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system Nissan called the ATTESA E-TS. The ATTESA E-TS system used two accelerometers mounted under the center console, which fed lateral and longitudinal inputs to the ECU. The ECU then controlled power delivery {{to the front}} wheels via an electronic torque split converter. In 1995, the ATTESA E-TS Pro was introduced as an option for R33 GT-R customers, and came as standard equipment in GT-R V.spec models. It was later standard equipment in all GT-R models for the R34 Skyline GT-R. The ATTESA E-TS Pro added an Active Limited Slip Differential, which was controlled by the onboard ATTESA computer. This was only for the rear differential, as the front differential remained as a normal Limited Slip Differential. The ATTESA E-TS Pro was also advertised in brochures as adding an electronically controlled <b>4-channel</b> ABS brake system. Although it {{is not related to}} the all wheel drive system, it uses much of the same sensors, and the same computer. The R32 could be switched from AWD to RWD by removing the 4WD fuse, but R33 and R34 models had to have the front tailshaft removed, or the centre diff can be depressurised for 'towing mode' as specified in the owners manual.|$|E
500|$|Since the mid-1950s, Stockhausen {{had been}} {{developing}} concepts of spatialization in his works, {{not only in}} electronic music, such as the 5-channel Gesang der Jünglinge (1955–56) and Telemusik (1966), and <b>4-channel</b> Kontakte (1958–60) and Hymnen (1966–67). Instrumental/vocal works like Gruppen for three orchestras (1955–57) and Carré for four orchestras and four choirs (1959–60) also exhibit this trait ( [...] ; [...] ). In lectures such as [...] "Music in Space" [...] from 1958 , he called for new kinds of concert halls to be built, [...] "suited {{to the requirements of}} spatial music". His idea was [...] In 1968, the West German government invited Stockhausen to collaborate on the German Pavilion at the 1970 World Fair in Osaka and to create a joint multimedia project for it with artist Otto Piene. Other collaborators on the project included the pavilion's architect, Fritz Bornemann, Fritz Winckel, director of the Electronic Music Studio at the Technical University of Berlin, and engineer Max Mengeringhausen. The pavilion theme was [...] "gardens of music", in keeping with which Bornemann intended [...] "planting" [...] the exhibition halls beneath a broad lawn, with a connected auditorium [...] "sprouting" [...] above ground. Initially, Bornemann conceived this auditorium {{in the form of an}} amphitheatre, with a central orchestra podium and surrounding audience space. In the summer of 1968, Stockhausen met with Bornemann and persuaded him to change this conception to a spherical space with the audience in the centre, surrounded by loudspeaker groups in seven rings at different [...] "latitudes" [...] around the interior walls of the sphere ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} track, entitled [...] "Acidjazzed Evening", is a chiptune-style, <b>4-channel</b> Amiga module {{composed by}} Finnish demoscener Janne Suni (a.k.a. Tempest). The song won {{first place in}} the Oldskool Music competition at Assembly 2000, a demoparty held in Helsinki, Finland, in 2000. According to Scene.org, the song was uploaded to their servers the same year, long before the release of the song by Furtado. The song was later remixed (with Suni's permission) by Norwegian Glenn Rune Gallefoss (a.k.a. GRG) for the Commodore 64 in SID format - this is the version which was later used for [...] "Do It". It was added to the High Voltage SID Collection on December 21, 2002.|$|E
2500|$|These were fertile {{years for}} {{electronic}} musicnot just for academia, but for independent artists as synthesizer technology became more accessible. By this time, a strong community of composers and musicians working with new sounds and instruments was established and growing. 1960 witnessed {{the composition of}} Luening's Gargoyles for violin and tape {{as well as the}} premiere of Stockhausen's Kontakte for electronic sounds, piano, and percussion. This piece existed in two versionsone for <b>4-channel</b> tape, and the other for tape with human performers. [...] "In Kontakte, Stockhausen abandoned traditional musical form based on linear development and dramatic climax. This new approach, which he termed 'moment form,' resembles the 'cinematic splice' techniques in early twentieth century film." ...|$|E

2500|$|The fighter {{plane is}} {{different}} from the MiG-29 flown by Indian Air Force. The aircraft has been modified for aircraft carrier operation by hardening the undercarriage. It also has much better 'over-the-nose' vision to make it easy to land aboard a carrier at a high angle of attack. Modifications made for Indian Navy requirement featured Zhuk-ME radar, RD-33MK engine, combat payload up to 5,500kg, 13 hardpoints (inclusive of the multi-lock bomb carriers), additional fuel tanks situated in dorsal spine fairing and wing LERXs, increased total fuel capacity by 50% comparing to first variant of MiG-29 and an updated <b>4-channel</b> digital fly-by-wire flight control system. With special coatings, the MiG-29K radar reflecting surface is 4–5 times smaller than of basic MiG-29.
