40|$|AbstractExperimental {{inoculation}} of naive ducks with {{duck hepatitis}} B virus (DHBV) {{can lead to}} one of three outcomes, namely, persistent viremia, transient infection with or without viremia, or no evidence of infection. The ability of individual ducks to resolve DHBV infection was found to be linked to the age of the duck at the time of inoculation and the dose of inoculated virus. (1) In recently hatched ducks inoculated intravenously (i. v.) with 4 × 104 DHBV DNA genomes, a switch from persistent viremia to transient antibody appearance was seen at an age of inoculation between 7 and 14 days. A 25 -fold increase in the dose of virus (1 × 106 DHBV genomes) delayed this switch by 7 days. (2) When 4 -month-old ducks were inoculated i. v. with different doses of virus, only those receiving the highest dose (2 × 1011 DHBV genomes) showed viremia and extensive viral replication and histological changes in the liver; 2 / 3 ducks in this group had a transient infection, while the third duck had viral replication and histological changes in the liver that were still present at day 120 postinoculation (p. i.). In all ducks receiving lower doses (1 × 103, 1 × 106, 1 × 109 DHBV genomes) antibodies to viral surface and core antigens developed without detectable viral replication in the liver on days 6, 9, or 12 p. i. (3) When 10 - to 16 -month-old ducks were inoculated i. v. with 2 × 1011 DHBV genomes, all showed extensive viral replication in hepatocytes and mild to moderate histological changes in the liver on days 4 or 6 p. i.

40|$|The glaciated prairie pothole {{country of}} the Midwest forms a vital segment of the most {{important}} waterfowl breeding habitat in North America. Here are hatched three-quarters of all the ducks raised in the United States. During a recent seven-year period the three-state area of Minnesota and the Dakotas produced an average of <b>4</b> to <b>5</b> million <b>ducks</b> annually (Janzon, 1947). This wetland region which once comprised 115, 000 square miles in five states had shrunk to about 56, 000 square miles by 19. 56 (Lynch, 1956). To maintain the pre,;ent rate of waterfowl production in the face of continued destruction of habitat through drainage and other land use practices detrimental to breeding ducks will require that remaining wet lands, particularly those in public ownership, be developed as much. as possible toward their maximum potential for waterfowl production. In recent years the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service has excavated several hundred experimental artificial potholes and level ditches on its refuges in the Dakotas and Minnesota. It was believed that these water areas would increase the number of ducks breeding on the refuge marshes by providing additional territorial sites. Before more funds are invested to expand this work it is important to determine the success of the existing development in meeting this objective. This study, to evaluate the artificial pothole and level ditch development, was initiated. in 1957 by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service at Lower Souris National Wildlife Refuge in North Dakota. The project was carried out in collaboration with the Utah Cooperative wildlife Research Unit and the Department of Wildlife Management, Utah State University...|$|R

The dechlorination mechanisms for all three compounds were expressed in 2, <b>4,</b> <b>5</b> -T- and 2, <b>4,</b> <b>5</b> -TCP-grown cells but were not expressed in cells grown on succinate, glucose, or lactate. The addition of 2, <b>4,</b> <b>5</b> -TCP or PCP to cells grown on succinate or lactate resulted in the {{expression of}} the 2, <b>4,</b> <b>5</b> -TCP dechlorination mechanism in resting cells after 1 -h lag. This expression was prevented by the presence of chloramphenicol in the resting cell suspension. Succinate-plus-PCP-grown resting cells preincubated with 2, <b>4,</b> <b>5</b> -TCP fully induced the trichlorophenol dechlorination system and partially induced the PCP dechlorination system.

In contrast to Ga (in GaAs), individual peaks in the In singles Auger line are not so well reproduced by a single APECS spectrum. There is intensity missing in the main In M <b>5</b> -N <b>4,</b> <b>5</b> N <b>4,</b> <b>5</b> line in coincidence with the 3 d 5 / 2 line which is only accounted for by intensity coming from the CK-preceded M 3 -M <b>5</b> N <b>4,</b> <b>5</b> -N <b>4,</b> <b>5</b> N <b>4,</b> <b>5</b> (N <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> process.

Interestingly, in contrast to what is observed in the coincidence experiment in Cu, the low-energy tail in Ag is not significantly reduced in the coincidence experiment and the Ag singles line shape is reproduced in the coincidence spectrum. This is interpreted as indicating that the probability for shake-up/shake-off in the initial state is significantly higher for Cu than for Ag, and indicates that the intrinsic processes in Ag are easily identified and assigned to particular photoemission lines. We conclude from these data that the Auger lines of elements from the second row of transition metals show many of the same effects as seen in the first transition series, but now with the added complication of Auger cascades that have greater complexity, and the broader background features due to shake-up/shake-off are not as intense...|$|R

The failure of submaximal concentrations of Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 and Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 [S] 3 to mobilize fully the Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 -sensitive Ca 2 + stores despite prolonged incubation was not due either to inactivation of Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 or to desensitization of the Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 receptor. The results suggest that the size of the Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 sensitive Ca 2 + stores depends upon the concentration of Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3...|$|R
40|$|Inositol 1, <b>4,</b> <b>5</b> -trisphosphate (Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P(3)) is {{phosphorylated}} by Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P(3) 3 -kinase, generating inositol 1, 3, <b>4,</b> <b>5</b> -tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1, 3, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P(4)). The {{physiological function}} of Ins(1, 3, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P(4) is still unclear, {{but it has}} been reported to be a potential modulator of calcium mobilization. Disruption of the gene encoding the ubiquitously expressed Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P(3) 3 -kinase isoform B (Itpkb) in mice caused a severe T cell deficiency due to major alterations in thymocyte responsiveness and selection. However, we were unable to detect substantial defects in Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P(3) amounts or calcium mobilization in Itpkb(-/-) thymocytes. These data indicate that Itpkb and Ins(1, 3, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P(4) define an essential signaling pathway for T cell precursor responsiveness and development.

These analogues were effective in inhibiting type I Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 5 -phosphatase activity with much the same potency as Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3, although the enzyme showed a lower Km value as pH values increased. In contrast, the analogues were less potent ligands than Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 in both the assay of [3 H]Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 binding to the receptors and the phosphorylation of [3 H]Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 catalysed by Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 3 -kinase. These results suggest that ionic interactions with the dianionic <b>4</b> - and <b>5</b> -phosphates of Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 are involved in recognition by the receptor and the kinase, but not by the phosphatase.

40|$|The {{action of}} {{carbachol}} on {{the generation of}} inositol trisphosphate and tetrakisphosphate isomers was investigated in dog-thyroid primary cultured cells radiolabelled with [3 H]inositol. The separation of the inositol phosphate isomers was performed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The structure of inositol phosphates co-eluting with inositol 1, <b>4,</b> <b>5</b> -trisphosphate [Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3] and inositol 1, 3, <b>4,</b> <b>5</b> -tetrakisphosphate [Ins(1, 3, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 4] standards was determined by enzymatic degradation using a purified Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 /Ins(1, 3, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P <b>4</b> <b>5</b> -phosphatase. The data indicate that Ins(1, 3, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P <b>4</b> was the only [3 H]inositol phosphate which co-eluted with a [32 P]Ins(1, 3, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P <b>4</b> standard, whereas 80 % of the [3 H]InsP 3 co-eluting with an Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 standard was actually this isomer. In the presence of Li+, carbachol led to rapid increases in [3 H]Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P <b>4.</b> The level of Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 reached a peak at 200 % of the control after 5 - 10 s of stimulation and fell to a plateau that remained slightly elevated for 2 min. The level of Ins(1, 3, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P <b>4</b> reached its maximum at 20 s. The level of inositol 1, 3, 4 -trisphosphate [Ins(1, 3, 4) P 3] increased continuously for 2 min after the addition of carbachol. Inositol-phosphate generation was also investigated under different pharmacological conditions. Li+ largely increased the level of Ins(1, 3, 4) P 3 but {{had no effect on}} Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 and Ins(1, 3, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P <b>4.</b> Forskolin, which stimulates dog-thyroid adenylate cyclase and cyclic-AMP accumulation, had no effect on the generation of inositol phosphates. The absence of extracellular Ca 2 + largely decreased the level of Ins(1, 3, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P <b>4</b> as expected considering the Ca 2 (+) -calmodulin sensitivity of the Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3 3 -kinase. Staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, increased the levels of Ins(1, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P 3, Ins(1, 3, <b>4,</b> <b>5)</b> P <b>4</b> and Ins(1, 3, 4) P 3.
