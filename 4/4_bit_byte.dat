40|$|Problem statement: Text {{compression}} permits {{representing a}} document by using less space. This is useful {{not only to}} save disk space, but more importantly, to save disk transfer and network transmission time. With the continues {{increase in the number}} of Arabic short text messages sent by mobile phones, the use of a suitable compression scheme would allow users to use more characters than the default value specified by the provider. The development of an efficient compression scheme to compress short Arabic texts is not a straight forward task. Approach: This study combined the benefits of pre-processing, entropy reduction through splitting files and hybrid dynamic coding: A new technique proposed in this study that uses the fact that Arabic texts have single case letters. Experimental tests had been performed on short Arabic texts and a comparison with the well known plain Huffman compression was made to measure the performance of the proposed schema for Arabic short text. Results: The proposed schema can achieve a compression ratio around <b>4.</b> 6 <b>bits</b> <b>byte</b> - 1 for very short Arabic text sequences of 15 <b>bytes</b> and around <b>4</b> <b>bits</b> <b>byte</b> - 1 for 50 bytes text sequences, using only 8 Kbytes overhead of memory. Conclusion: Furthermore, a reasonable compression ratio can be achieved using less than 0. 4 KB of memory overhead. We recommended the use of proposed schema to compress small Arabic text with recourses limited...|$|R

25|$|Because each FAT32 entry {{occupies}} 32 <b>bits</b> (<b>4</b> <b>bytes)</b> the maximal {{number of}} clusters (268435444) requires 2097152 FAT sectors for a sector size of 512 bytes. 2097152 is 0x200000, and storing this value needs {{more than two}} bytes.

30|$|To {{make all}} nodes {{accessible}} in the network, a unique address must {{be assigned to}} each node. The length of assigned address of the IPv 6 to every node in the network is 128 <b>bits</b> (16 <b>bytes),</b> whereas in the IPv 4, it was 32 <b>bits</b> (<b>4</b> <b>bytes).</b> This address is categorized into three subcomponents [30]: link-local address, site local address, and global address. The first one is used to limit the communication inside the node’s link so the packet will not be routed outside the nodes. In the second one, a unique address is used to limit the interconnection within a specific geographical area. In the latter, a globally unique address is used to allow the packets to traverse anywhere. The address organization in IPv 6 protocol is similar to IPv 4 but with two main differences. The first is the length of an address in IPv 6 is longer than the address of IPv 4. The second {{is the concept of}} prefix used in IPv 6 instead of the net-mask as in the IPv 4 protocol.|$|R
