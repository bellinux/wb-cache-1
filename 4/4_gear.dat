5000|$|North America {{receives}} {{its first}} Impreza WRX models. They {{are equipped with}} an EJ205 engine rated at [...] at 6000 rpm with 217 lbft Nm at 4000 rpm. Unlike the Japanese EJ205, the US-spec engine uses a Mitsubishi TD04-13T turbocharger unit. In stock form, it reaches a peak [...] of boost. The seats {{are the same as}} the basic J-spec Impreza. The wheels are cast 16" [...] x 6.5" [...] version of the J-spec WRX NB wheels while the brakes are 2-piston/1-piston front and rear with the front rotors being ventilated disks. 2002 WRXs came with brake duct plates that guided the air in the front bumper vent to the wheel well. The gear ratios are the standard export models, but the final drive is a 3.9:1 ratio. The rear LSD is a viscous coupling type. The steering rack has a ratio of 16.5:1. The <b>4</b> <b>gear</b> electronic automatic transmission (4EAT) WRXs have a Variable Torque Distribution AWD system instead of the conventional viscous coupling center differential. VTD employs an electronically controlled hydraulic transfer clutch and a planetary gear center differential to distribute power in a 45:55 split between the front and rear axles under normal circumstances. The VTD system uses multiple sensors to measure front and rear driveshaft speeds, throttle position and gear selection. Then it actively transfers power accordingly between the front and rear wheels for optimum traction and handling. The WRX weighs 3085 lb.|$|E

The shift lever was column-mounted and had three positions: Low (in the [...] "2nd" [...] position of a conventional 3-speed manual unit), High (in the [...] "3rd" [...] position), and Reverse (same as the 3-speed). The clutch had to be depressed every time the gear shift lever was moved. When the lever was put in Low, the car started in [...] "underdrive" [...] low; when the vehicle reached a minimum speed of 6 mph (9.7 km/h), the driver lifted his foot off the accelerator, the underdrive unit would kick out and the car would be in Low. Similarly, with the lever in High position, the car would start in underdrive high, and at any speed above 13 mph (21 km/h), the driver would lift his foot and the car would [...] "shift" [...] into direct drive.This configuration {{had the effect of}} providing <b>4</b> <b>gear</b> ratios:Underdrive Low, 3.57/1,Low 2.04/1,Underdrive High, 1.75/1,High, 1/1.In order for the unit to work without gear clashing, it contained a freewheeling device (in Underdrive, Low and High), and the Owner’s manual cautioned drivers not to use [...] "1st or 3rd" [...] gear when descending hills, because there was no engine compression braking in those free-wheeling ranges. Generally, most drivers started an M6 car in High and accomplished the shift to direct drive somewhere between 13 and 25 MPH by releasing the accelerator pedal and waiting for the [...] "clunk" [...] that signaled the disengagement of the underdrive. An M6 car would automatically shift from High down to underdrive high when car speed dropped below approximately 11 MPH.|$|E

The effects of higher harmonics of driving torque are studied by numerical analysis. As a result, the followings were made clear. (1) In the resonance region of lower mode, when the frequency of driving torque is nearly equal to the one which is the natural frequency of higher mode divided by some integer, the response contains the higher mode and its amplitude of acceleration becomes large. However this phenomenon is not so affected by the higher harmonics of driving torque. (2) First harmonic of driving torque generates higher harmonic resonance and higher harmonic of driving torque generates the main resonance, hence the interaction of these two resonances makes the amplitude of the resonance large. (3) Because of interaction of higher harmonics of driving torque and mesh stiffness variation, resonances like gear noise occur with many side-bands in low frequency region, and {{the region of the}} rattles becomes wide.

40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} widely used {{equipments}} in harvesting hay and grains are four wheel mowers. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the levels of noise exposure in drivers and bystanders in different states, speeds and gear of four wheel mowers (BCS Model 622). Methods: The ISO 5131 and ISO 6814 standards were used to assess noise exposure in drivers and bystanders, respectively. Experiments were done in totally randomized block models in the form of 2 × 3 × 4 factorials (2 moving blade conditions, 3 states of various motor rpm’s and <b>4</b> <b>gear</b> states) and three repetitions. Sound pressure levels were measured both at the driver’s ear level and the bystanders. In conditions where in the level of exposure was above permissible noise limits, octave band analysis was performed. Data analysis was performed in Excel and SPSS 16. Results: Drivers were exposed to noise pollution higher than the permissible level (according to the ACGIH standards) at 3000 rpm. Factors affecting noise level exposure in the driver and bystander included engine speed, gear ratio and cutting blade speeds and were all significant at the 0. 01 level. Conclusion: Routive use of harvesting machines leads to adverse auditory effects. This fact highlights the necessity of controlling noise emission from this machine through engineering, technical and managemental practices.

40|$|Introduction: Tractor {{drivers are}} {{continuously}} exposed to whole body vibration during driving that, this may cause disorders {{in the system}} of musculoskeletal, nervous, circulatory and occupational diseases. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate exposed to whole body vibration among tractor driver.. Material and Method: In this study, whole-body vibration parameters such as root mean square (rms) of acceleration, total equivalent acceleration, vibration dose value (VDV) and crest factor (CF) were separately compared in three directions (x, y, and z), in 3 Massey Ferguson Model 165 Tractor it was done during 3 different modes of transport (without trailer, with empty trailer and with a trailer load of soil), plowing the land and loading trailer in working conditions with various gear according to the guidelines of ISO 2631 standard.. Result: The results showed that in all measuring points, exposure to whole body vibration was higher than permissible level and the risks of disorders exist. Exposure to vibration were as with empty trailer (43. 11 m/s 2). The maximum of crest factor was obtained for transportation mode of empty trailer with 3 gear (10. 7), then plowing (7. 35) and loading soil(6. 50). The maximum of vibration dose value was eventuated for transportation mode with empty trailer with <b>4</b> <b>gear</b> (189. 92 m/s 1. 75) and 3 gear (108. 15 m/s 1. 75).

40|$|Passive capture {{techniques}} {{involve the}} capture of fishes or other aquatic animals by entanglement, entrapment, or angling devices that are not actively moved by humans or machines while the organisms are being captured (Lagler 1978). The behavior and movements of the animals themselves result in their capture. The techniques used in passive sampling of fish populations {{are similar to those}} used for food gathering over the centuries. Nets and traps have been widely used among various cultures, and many of the currently applied techniques were used by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans (Alverson 1963). Based on their mode of capture, passive sampling devices can be divided into three groups: (1) entanglement, (2) entrapment, and (3) angling gears. Entanglement devices capture fish by holding them ensnared or tangled in webbing or mesh made of natural or artificial materials. Gill nets and trammel nets are examples of entanglement gears (Figure 6. 1). Entrapment devices capture organisms that enter an enclosed area through one or more funnel- or V-shaped openings that hinder escape after entrance. Hoop nets, trap nets, and pot devices are examples of entrapment gears (Figures 6. 2 and 6. 3). Angling devices capture fish with a baited hook and line. Trotlines and longlines are examples of passive angling gears (Figure 6. <b>4).</b> <b>Gear</b> selectivity and gear efficiency are important considerations with respect to passive sampling devices. Often these terms are used interchangeably, but they have different, specific definitions. Gear selectivity is the bias of a sample obtained with a given gear (Box 6. 1). Selectivity for species, sizes, and sexes of fishes occurs in samples taken with specific types of gear. Species selectivity refers to overrepresentation of particular species in samples as compared with the assemblage of species present. Similarly, size or sex selectivity refers to overrepresentation of specific sizes (lengths) or one sex within samples from a fish population. Fisheries scientists may use gear selectivity to their benefit when targeting specific species or sizes of fishes, thereby enhancing their sampling efficiency. The efficiency of a gear refers to the amount of effort expended to capture target organisms (Box 6. 2). It is generally desirable to maximize the efficiency of a sampling gear to save time and money in single-species assessments of fisheries. Even with efficient sampling gear, the sampling effort needed to estimate the relative abundance and other descriptive statistics for a given species may be unrealistic (Gerow 2007) ...|$|E
40|$|The Working Group on Spatial Fisheries Data (WGSFD) met at ICES Headquarters, Copenhagen, 10 – 13 June 2014. ICES {{had issued}} two data calls for {{aggregated}} VMS {{data for the}} years 2009 – 2012 : one covering the OSPAR region and one covering the HELCOM region. The group evaluated the data, and used them to answer the ToRs. ICES have produced a document describing ICES Conditions for VMS data use, which {{all members of the}} group signed. The VMS data that ICES received is only to be used for ICES work and after answering the ToRs, the data are to be deleted. The submitted VMS data were aggregated to DCF métier level 6, giving more than 900 unique codes; however some countries only submitted data aggregated to level <b>4</b> <b>gear</b> codes. To overcome this discrepancy, it was decided to group the métiers into broader gear categories. For the OSPAR region: Bottom trawls, Dredges, Demersal seines and Beam trawls. For the HELCOM region: Gillnets, Longlines, Bottom trawls and Midwater trawls. As part of the evaluation of the data quality, the aggregated VMS effort data submitted was compared to effort data from the STECF database. These two independent datasets showed similar overall patterns, indicating that the submitted VMS dataset could be used to show the distribution of fishing effort. WGSFD produced a cleaned VMS dataset, aggregated by year and gear groupings, which other ICES EG’s can use. Caveats applying to all the VMS data products and maps in the report were listed. Based on the evaluation of the submitted data, a revised exchange format for aggregated VMS data was suggested. To answer ToR a, DCF indicators 5, 6 and 7 were computed byyear, ICES area (sub-division in the Baltic) and both by gear group and total for all gears. DCF indicator 5 relates to the total area covered by fishing activity, DCF indicator 6 has been calculated as the extent to which fishing activities are aggregated, and DCF indicator 7, the total area not impacted by fishing activities, was calculated by subtracting DCF indicator 5 fishing area from the area of the ICES area/subdivision. All the DCF indicators have been expressed both as area and proportions of the total area. In ToR a, WGSFD was also requested to contribute to ICES work on MSFD descriptor 6. The group produced a cleaned dataset, aggregated by year and gear group, which other ICES EG’s can use to relate fishing pressure to potential impact on underlying habitats. The following example outputs were produced: 1. Map of mean fishing effort in number of hours per km 2. 2. Map of increase/decrease in fishing effort over the years analysed. 3. Map of number of years a c-square has been impacted, with different thresholds. For ToR b, WGSFD responded to requests from other ICES EG’s: Requests from WGBFAS and WGNSSK related to fishing effort, a request from WGMPCZM and a request from ADGVME regarding use of AIS data. For ToR c on reviewing ongoing work for analysing VMS data, WGSFD were updated on: • the ongoing work in the BENTHIS project; • a method developed by JNCC for estimating benthic abrasion caused by human activities; • a nested grids method for calculating the area of the seabed impacted by fishing gear; • the bias and variance of estimates of fishing effort from VMS data; • production of an Atlas of Commercial Fisheries around Ireland. ToR d was a request from OSPAR to propose and apply a method to map mobile bottom contact fishing intensity and to prepare a first OSPAR-wide map of the spatial and temporal intensity of mobile bottom-contact fishing activities. The co-lead of the ICG-COBAM benthic expert group was present at the meeting to provide information both on the purpose of the data call and how the products were to be analysed. The group performed an initial evaluation of whether the data submitted served the purpose of the OSPAR request, and based on this work, WGSFD proposed a revised exchange format for future data calls for aggregated VMS data. Maps for the OSPAR region showing VMS effort by year and gear group were produced as well as a map showing the gear composition in the area and an example map applying the abrasion methodology giving maps of surface and sub-surface bottom contact...|$|E
