50|$|This {{stereotype}} {{is mainly}} {{a product of}} the many Nigerian prince <b>419</b> <b>scams</b> which were popular.

Most internet scammers simply prefer to use Nigeria and Nigerian identities in their schemes.|$|R
50|$|Wire {{transfers}} {{done through}} cash offices are essentially anonymous and {{are designed for}} transfer between persons who trust each other.

40|$|Incidents of {{organized}} cybercrime are rising because of criminals are reaping high financial rewards while incurring low costs to commit crime.

50|$|Some 419 scams involve {{even more}} serious crimes, such as {{kidnapping}} or murder. One such case, in 2008, involves Osamai Hitomi, a Japanese businessman who was lured to Johannesburg, South Africa and kidnapped on September 26, 2008. The kidnappers took him to Alberton, south of Johannesburg, and demanded a $5 million ransom from his family. Seven people were ultimately arrested. In July 2001, Joseph Raca, a former mayor of Northampton, UK, was kidnapped by scammers in Johannesburg, South Africa, who demanded a ransom of £20,000. The captors released Raca after they became nervous. One <b>419</b> <b>scam</b> that ended in murder occurred in February 2003, when Jiří Pasovský, a 72-year-old scam victim from the Czech Republic, shot and killed 50-year-old Michael Lekara Wayid, {{an official at the}} Nigerian embassy in Prague, and injured another person, after the Nigerian Consul General explained he could not return the $600,000 that Pasovský had lost to a Nigerian scammer.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{variants}} of the Spanish Prisoner include the advance-fee scam, {{in particular the}} Nigerian money transfer (or <b>419)</b> <b>scam.</b> In the advance-fee fraud, a valuable item must be ransomed from a warehouse, crooked customs agent, or lost-baggage facility before the authorities or thieves recognize its value. In the Nigerian variation, a self-proclaimed relative of a deposed African dictator offers to transfer millions of ill-gotten dollars into the bank account of the victim in return for small initial payments to cover bribes and other expenses. More recent examples feature people sharing the same surname as the intended victim, with the scammer guessing the surname from observing patterns in e-mail addresses, or obtaining full names from harvested email headers. Another variation spreads via hijacked Facebook accounts, where a message is sent to all the Facebook friends of the victim, claiming that the victim is in a foreign country, has been robbed, and needs one of the Facebook friends to [...] "send money" [...] via Western Union to pay hotel and travel bills.|$|E
30|$|To {{alleviate}} the incentives for cyber-criminals {{to engage in}} illegal enterprise online, defenders endeavor to make attacks more expensive [11]. Simultaneously, criminals can be deterred through legal and regulatory solutions, i.e., prosecution [12] or takedowns by law enforcement [13]. While legal deterrence is promising [14], its impact may be limited [15]. For example, even when cyber-criminals are prosecuted, in the long term, they can move to another jurisdiction that is more forgiving of undesirable behavior. Note that for countries with non-extant legitimate information communication technology (ICT) market, it may be economically rational to allow cybercrime to persist [16]. For example, {{in a country like}} Nigeria, <b>419</b> <b>scams</b> result in an increased inflow of capital which corresponds with improved (local) social welfare [17].|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{problems}} are {{encountered in the}} courier phase of the scam. The crate is too small and the victim has the option of either purchasing a crate with air conditioning or renting one while also paying a deposit, typically called a caution or cautionary fee. The victim may also {{have to pay for}} insurance if such fees have not been paid yet. If the victim pays these fees, the pet may become sick and a veterinarian's assistance is sought for which the victim has to repay the courier. Additionally, the victim may be asked to pay for a health certificate needed to transport the pet, and for kennel fees during the recuperation period. The further the scam progresses, the more similar are the fictitious fees to those of typical <b>419</b> <b>scams.</b> It is not uncommon to see customs or like fees being claimed if such charges fit into the scam plot.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on Advance Fee Fraud (<b>419</b> <b>scams)</b> on how it is {{executed}} and more importantly, on {{how it can be}} prevented. The research addresses the origins of AFF, {{the nature and extent of}} this crime and how the perpetrators are able to defraud their victims. The research described, examined and analysed the crimes, the perpetrators, the victims, adjudication and the prevention strategies of this fraud. Information was gathered through literature and empirical research. A qualitative research method was used to gather information from AFF offenders who were incarcerated in South African prisons in 2005. The results of the empirical research were carefully examined, analyzed and integrated into the various chapters of this thesis. A theoretical framework was also developed in an attempt to explain this complex phenomenon. The findings and recommendations in terms of the crimes, the criminals, the victims, adjudication and prevention were also made and some suggestions for further research thereof were also cited.
