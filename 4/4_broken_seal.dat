6000|$|... "'You {{have been}} with him, I see,' says the reverend gent, with a shrug: then I remembered what you had told me of the <b>broken</b> <b>seal</b> of your letter, and have not the {{slightest}} doubt that Brough opened and read every word of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "We didn't," [...] Hobson replied bitterly. [...] "We've sent a {{representative}} over {{to sit on}} the box with the <b>broken</b> <b>seals</b> till they can open it at the Foreign Office in London, but I never believed they'd find anything there. I'm damned certain they won't now!" ...|$|R
50|$|Opened bottles or any {{alcoholic}} beverage with a <b>broken</b> <b>seal</b> {{may not be}} stored {{in an area of}} the vehicle accessible to the driver. As a result, Oklahoma meets the provisions of the federal Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century for prohibitions of open containers in vehicles.|$|R
60|$|Miss Ophelia was old, {{and skilled}} in {{the tactics of}} nursing. She was from New England, and knew well the first guileful {{footsteps}} of that soft, insidious disease, which sweeps away {{so many of the}} fairest and loveliest, and, before one fibre of life seems <b>broken,</b> <b>seals</b> them irrevocably for death.|$|R

Later in the decade, he played Romeo to Olga Nethersole's Juliet, and Mercutio to Maude Adams's Juliet. Hackett played Captain Basil Jennico in the 1900 production of The Pride of Jennico with Bertha Galland in her New York stage debut.|$|R
60|$|In saying this, {{the father}} assumed {{an air of}} such fearlessness and calm authority, that the young lawyer, {{surprised}} and overawed, forbore, as he had intended, to snatch the letter from his hand, and confined himself to bitter complaints of the impropriety of his conduct, and of the light in which he himself must be placed to Redgauntlet should he present him a letter with a <b>broken</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Kevin Magnussen {{suffered}} from back burns and dehydration after his drinks bottle became hot {{because of a}} <b>broken</b> radiator <b>seal.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "What would come, pray?" [...] Newman demanded. He had <b>broken</b> the <b>seal</b> of the letter, but {{he still}} questioned. [...] "She is in the house? She is visible?" ...|$|R
50|$|As {{however it}} {{was found in the}} company of the two Sri Harsha seals the {{probability}} is that both Sri Harsha and Bhaskar Varman, on their march from Rajmahal to Kanauj, visited Nalanda together with the Chinese pilgrim and, to commemorate their visit, left their respective seals at the university. This custom was evidently in vogue, for a considerable number of similar <b>broken</b> <b>seals</b> were discovered at the site, during the excavation. These seals being impressed upon clay tablets or plaques are decipherable though they were entombed under debris for so many centuries.|$|R
50|$|Above the {{combination}} is a metallic band with the State abbreviation (SP = São Paulo, RJ = Rio de Janeiro, PR = Paraná, AM = Amazonas etc.) {{and the name}} of the municipality in which the vehicle is currently registered. This band has to be changed when a vehicle needs to be registered in a different municipality. Rear number plates are bound to the vehicle by a plastic <b>seal.</b> <b>Broken</b> <b>seals</b> invalidate the number plate, which has to be re-sealed by the authorities. Seals need to be broken in order to change State/Municipality tags.|$|R

50|$|The grid is set by {{reversing}} the top 10 qualifiers (whoever qualifies 10th {{will be on}} pole, and whoever qualifies 1st will start from 10th). The top 10 qualifiers also receive points, starting from 20 and decreasing by 2 for every place until 10th place, after which drivers receive 0 points. Rookies always start {{from the rear of}} the grid as do competitors who have <b>broken</b> <b>seals</b> on controlled components such as differentials. Drivers can also elect to start from the back should they wish to do so.|$|R
60|$|Mannering rose {{slowly to}} his feet and moved to the lamp. Directly he had <b>broken</b> the <b>seal</b> he understood. He read the first line and looked up. His eyes met Hester's.|$|R

50|$|Four {{police forces}} in Britain and France made {{extensive}} inquiries {{for months and}} arrested hundreds of suspects for questioning but found nothing. Afterwards {{many of those who}} had handled the boxes reported small discrepancies like holes and <b>broken</b> <b>seals.</b> The main suspects were railway staff members at Folkestone. The South Eastern Railway offered a sizeable reward and named its own investigator but received only false information. The official British theory was that the robbery had taken place on the continent, while the French police claimed it had happened in England because of the discrepancy in the boxes' weights at Boulogne.|$|R
50|$|Today... A mysterious {{women has}} <b>broken</b> the <b>seal,</b> {{but in the}} process disappeared. Once again the dark powers of Randgris and her Cursed Stone are free to terrorize the human world once again.|$|R
50|$|A <b>broken</b> {{steatite}} <b>seal</b> of Mature Harappan {{period was}} discovered here in 2010. While a Harappan seal was collected previously {{from the surface}} of Rakhigarhi, no seal or sealing was found in Mitathal itself.|$|R
6000|$|King Dives he {{was walking}} in his garden in the sun, [...] He shook his hand at heaven, and he called the wheels to run, [...] And the eyes of him were hateful eyes, the lips of him were curled, [...] And he called upon his father that is lord below the world, [...] Sitting in the Gate of Treason, in the gate of <b>broken</b> <b>seals,</b> [...] "Bend and bind them, bend and bind them, bend and bind them into wheels, [...] Then once more in all my garden there may swing and sound and sweep-- [...] The noise of all the sleepless things that sing the soul to sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is risk," [...] he admitted. [...] "It is {{not easy}} to amuse oneself {{anywhere}} without it. I have been offered a hundred thousand pounds to superintend the conveyance of certain documents and a certain letter to Berlin. The adventure appeals to me, and I have undertaken it. Until I found this man following me this afternoon, I really believed that we had put every one off the track. I {{know for a fact that}} most of the American officials believe that the papers for which they have searched so long and anxiously are in that trunk with the <b>broken</b> <b>seals</b> which they found at Halifax." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1985 at Alabama, Hand had 77 tackles, 7 tackles for losses, <b>4</b> <b>broken</b> up passes, 1 sack, 1 interception, a blocked {{field goal}} and caused 3 fumbles. He {{was named to}} The Sporting News' 1985 College Football All-America Team.|$|R

50|$|Lucian's own close {{investigations}} into Alexander's methods of fraud {{led to a}} serious attempt on his life. The whole account gives a graphic description of the inner working of one among the many new oracles that were springing up at this period. Alexander had remarkable beauty and the striking personality of the successful charlatan, and {{must have been a}} man of considerable intellectual abilities and power of organization. His usual methods were those of the numerous oracle-mongers of the time, of which Lucian gives a detailed account: the opening of sealed inquiries by heated needles, a neat plan of forging <b>broken</b> <b>seals,</b> and the giving of vague or meaningless replies to difficult questions, coupled with a lucrative blackmailing of those whose inquiries were compromising.|$|R
50|$|An auspicious {{start to}} the 2013 season {{following}} Force 11-12 winds left H27 sunk (albeit successfully salvaged) and H8, H9, H34, H53 de-masted with <b>4</b> <b>broken</b> masts requiring replacement and stem heads re-securing. H8 lost its mooring and beached on rocks albeit the damage was limited to a few broken planks.|$|R
50|$|At the count, {{the postal}} ballot boxes have their <b>seals</b> <b>broken,</b> are opened {{and then the}} postal ballot papers are counted.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now that,' said Redgauntlet, 'I hold to {{be pretty}} much the same, IN FORO CONSCIENTIAE, {{as if you had}} <b>broken</b> the <b>seal</b> yourself.

6000|$|... "Here, Henrietta," [...] {{said her}} mother, {{as they sat}} at breakfast {{together}} {{a day or two}} after Frederick's departure, turning over to her the letter of which she had first <b>broken</b> the <b>seal,</b> while she proceeded to open some others. It was Uncle Geoffrey's writing, and Henrietta read eagerly: ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} moment {{inspired by}} actual events is {{the execution of}} a village priest for acting in favour of the Fascist side: he has <b>broken</b> the <b>seal</b> of confessions, telling the fascists where the anarchists were hiding and causing their deaths.
