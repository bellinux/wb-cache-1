25|$|AMC {{purchased}} Kaiser's Jeep {{utility vehicle}} operations in 1970 to complement its existing passenger car business. Beginning {{in the early}} 1970s, the company moved towards all-new compact car designs based on the Hornet, including the Hornet itself and the Gremlin. Other new models in the 1970s included the Matador and Pacer. Sagging sales and tight finances resulted in {{the elimination of the}} Matador line in the 1979 model year and the Pacer line in 1980, leaving AMC to focus almost exclusively on its Hornet platform based cars and the Jeep line. Hornet derivatives of the late 1970s included the Spirit and Concord, while the innovative <b>4-wheel-drive</b> AMC Eagle introduced in 1979 {{was one of the first}} true crossovers.|$|E
2500|$|AMC went on {{to compete}} with the US Big Three, Ford, GM and Chrysler [...] with its small cars {{including}} the Rambler American, Hornet, Gremlin and Pacer; muscle cars including the Marlin, AMX and Javelin, and early <b>4-wheel-drive</b> variants of the [...] Eagle, America's first true crossover.|$|E
2500|$|American Motors lost an {{estimated}} $65million on its conventional (non-Jeep) cars {{for the fiscal}} year ended September 30, 1978, but strong Jeep sales helped the company to an overall $36.7million profit on sales of $2.6billion.

2500|$|The {{original}} Jeep was {{the prototype}} Bantam BRC. Willys MB Jeeps went into production in 1941 {{specifically for the}} military, arguably making them the oldest four-wheel drive mass-production vehicles now known as SUVs. The Jeep became the primary light <b>4-wheel-drive</b> vehicle of the United States Army and the Allies during World War II, {{as well as the}} postwar period. The term became common worldwide {{in the wake of the}} war. Doug Stewart notes: ...|$|E
2500|$|After the AMC-based <b>4-wheel-drive</b> Eagle wagon was dropped, Chrysler and Eagle {{officials}} were busy figuring out {{which type of}} vehicles {{would be best for}} the new division.

50|$|Another type of {{bulldozer}} is the wheeled bulldozer, {{which generally}} has four wheels {{driven by a}} <b>4-wheel-drive</b> system and has a hydraulic, articulated steering system. The blade is mounted forward of the articulation joint, and is hydraulically actuated.|$|E
50|$|Golf cart {{injuries}} are also {{commonly found in}} desert areas (i.e. Johnson Valley). Driving golf carts on dirt trails, along drop off cliffs, down rocky trails that should only be traversed using <b>4-wheel-drive</b> vehicles, can all lead to injuries.|$|E

50|$|Rollover risk is {{inherently}} higher in truck-based vehicles, like the Explorer, than in ordinary passenger cars, as modification for bulky <b>4-wheel-drive</b> hardware requires increases in height to avoid compromising ground clearance (raising {{the center of}} gravity), while a short wheelbase further reduces stability. The previous Bronco II had already been cited by Consumer Reports for rollover tendencies in turns.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2005, Porsche {{announced}} the all-wheel-drive versions to the 997 lineup. Carrera 4 models (both Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S) were announced as 2006 models. Both Carrera 4 models are wider than their rear-wheel-drive counterparts by 1.76 inches (32 mm) to cover wider rear tires. 0-60 mph (97 km/h) for a base Carrera 4 with the [...] engine was reported at 4.5 seconds according to Edmunds.com. The 0-100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration for the Carrera S with the [...] was noted {{to be as}} fast as 4.2 seconds in a recent Motor Trend comparison, and Road & Track has timed it at 3.8 seconds. The 997 lineup includes both 2- and <b>4-wheel-drive</b> variants, named Carrera and Carrera 4 respectively. The Targas (4 and 4S), released in November 2006, are <b>4-wheel-drive</b> versions that divide {{the difference between the}} coupés and the cabriolets with their dual, sliding glass tops.|$|E

50|$|From Ridgecrest, California State Route 178 leads {{northeast}} into Death Valley National Park. The road {{turns to}} unpaved about 50 mi later as it loses its highway status. It winds up through Wildrose Canyon up to {{a parking lot}} where the trail for the summit starts. The section from the Charcoal Kilns can be rough and might only be suitable for <b>4-wheel-drive</b> cars with high clearance, depending on weather conditions.|$|E
50|$|Many modern SUVs use height {{adjustability}} as part {{of active}} suspension systems to improve the vehicle's versatility on and off-road. The Range Rover offered this feature from 1993. New models of the Ford Expedition have a computer-controlled system designed for convenience, which lowers automatically when the doors are unlocked by remote, returns to normal height when the vehicle is started, and (on <b>4-wheel-drive</b> models), raises when the 4x4 system is engaged.|$|E
50|$|The pass {{is closed}} {{for most of}} the year due to snow or mud, and is open only for one or two months in late summer.

The road is accessible only by high-clearance <b>4-wheel-drive</b> trucks from this side. Two miles from the trailhead lies Geneva Lake.|$|E
