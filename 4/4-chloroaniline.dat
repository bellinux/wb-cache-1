2500|$|Many analogues of aniline {{are known}} where the phenyl group is further substituted. [...] These include toluidines, xylidines, chloroanilines, aminobenzoic acids, nitroanilines, and many others.

50|$|Diflubenzuron {{has been}} {{evaluated}} by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and it is classified as non-carcinogenic. <b>4-Chloroaniline,</b> a metabolite of diflubenzuron which has been classified as a carcinogen, is produced after diflubenzuron has been ingested. The small amount converted to <b>4-chloroaniline</b> after ingestion {{is not sufficient to}} cause cancer.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>4-Chloroaniline</b> is an {{important}} building block used in the chemical industry {{for the production of}} pesticides, drugs, and dyestuffs. It is a precursor to the widely used antimicrobial and bacteriocide chlorhexidine and is used in the manufacture of pesticides, including pyraclostrobin, anilofos, monolinuron and chlorphthalim. Some benzodiazepine drugs use <b>4-chloroaniline</b> in their manufacture.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>4-Chloroaniline</b> {{can be used}} to make {{dorastine}} (antihistamine), lorcainide (antiarrhythmic) and Ontianil.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>4-Chloroaniline</b> is an {{organochlorine}} compound with the formula ClC6H4NH2. This pale yellow solid {{is one of}} several known chloroanilines.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>4-Chloroaniline</b> is not {{prepared}} from aniline, which tends to overchlorinate. Instead, it is prepared by hydrogenation of 4-nitrochlorobenzene, {{which in turn is}} prepared by nitration of chlorobenzene.|$|E

50|$|Since 1987, {{octenidine}} {{has been}} used in Europe as an antiseptic, in concentrations of 0.1-2.0%. It is a substitute for chlorhexidine, with respect to its slow action and concerns about the carcinogenic impurity <b>4-chloroaniline.</b> Octenidine preparations are less expensive than chlorhexidine and no resistance had been observed as of 2007. They may contain the antiseptic phenoxyethanol.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-Nitrochlorobenzene is an {{intermediate}} {{in the preparation}} of a variety of derivatives. Nitration gives 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, and 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene. Reduction with iron metal gives <b>4-chloroaniline.</b> The electron-withdrawing nature of the appended nitro-group makes the benzene ring especially susceptible to nucleophilic aromatic substitution, unlike related chlorobenzene. Thus, the strong nucleophiles hydroxide, methoxide, and amide displace chloride to give respectively 4-nitrophenol, 4-nitroanisole, 4-nitroaniline.|$|E
50|$|When {{triclocarban}} is manufactured, 139 toxic, carcinogenic byproducts, such as <b>4-chloroaniline</b> and 3,4-dichloroaniline, are released. More {{of these}} carcinogens can be released upon chemical, physical and biological attack of triclocarban. The duration of triclocarban chemical in personal product use is relatively short. Upon disposal, the triclocarban is washed {{down the drain}} to municipal wastewater treatment plants, where about 97-98% of triclocarban {{is removed from the}} water.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} experiment, two narcotics, {{tricaine}} methanesulfonate and 1-octanol, and two uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, pentachlorophenol and 2,4-dinitrophenol, were used. During the second experiment, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and respiratory irritants were evaluated. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were an organophosphate, Malathion and a carbamate, Carbaryl. The respiratory irritants were Acrolein and Benzaldehyde. In part {{three of the}} experiment series, polar narcotics phenol, 2,4-dimethylphenol, aniline, 2-chloroaniline and <b>4-chloroaniline</b> were evaluated. In the last experiment, central nervous system seizure agents were analyzed. These included an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, Chlorpyrifos; two pyrethroid insecticides, Fenvalerate and Cypermethrin; two cyclodiene insecticides, Endrin and Endosulfan; and a rodenticide, Strychnine. The duration of the exposure depended on the experiment, but the range was from 24 to 48 hours. Therefore, exposure resulted in acute toxicity. The Rainbow trout were exposed to a 24- to 48-hour lethal concentration of the toxicant. The respiratory and cardiovascular responses monitored throughout the exposure were cough rate, ventilation rate, ventilation volume, total oxygen consumption, oxygen utilization, heart rate, arterial blood pressure, arterial blood oxygen, arterial blood carbon dioxide, arterial blood pH, hematocrit, hemoglobin, electrocardiogram, plasma ions (calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and chloride), and osmolality. Pre-dose values were obtained prior to the exposure. The responses were measured at two-hour intervals throughout the exposure, except for blood parameters, which were measured every four to eight hours, and blood ions, which were measured just before death.|$|E
