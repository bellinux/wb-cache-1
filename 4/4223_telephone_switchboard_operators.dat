5000|$|Much earlier (than WW1) {{published}} {{references to}} [...] "Hello Girls" [...] exist. The term was first coined {{for the female}} <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators</b> in the US. The earliest reference is in Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court written in 1889. [...] Although the term may have been applied to the signalling corps, it did not originate there but was rather the common term used for the ladies who would say hello when you rang the switch as opposed to direct calling.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of telephony, through roughly the 1960s, {{companies}} used manual <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboards,</b> and <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators</b> connected calls by inserting a pair of phone plugs into the appropriate jacks.|$|R
50|$|In the RCAF, women became clerks, drivers, photographers, air photo interpreters, weather observers, {{instrument}} mechanics, parachute riggers {{as well as}} staffing many {{administrative and}} technical positions. As a CWAC, women took over 21 types of army duties as secretaries, clerks, canteen workers, vehicle drivers and many other non-combat military jobs. As a CWREN, women served in 26 non-combatant occupations in Canadian naval bases at home or abroad.

50|$|The book {{centers on}} the emotionally {{challenged}} Lenore Stonecipher Beadsman, a 24-year-old <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> <b>operator</b> who questions her own reality. In Wallace's typically offbeat style, Lenore navigates three separate crises: her great-grandmother's escape from a nursing home, a neurotic boyfriend, and a suddenly vocal pet cockatiel. The controlling idea surrounding all of these crises {{is the use of}} words and symbols to define a person. To illustrate this idea, Wallace uses different formats to build the story, including transcripts from television recordings and therapy sessions, as well as an accompanying fictional account written by one of the main characters, Rick Vigorous.|$|R
5000|$|During {{his tenure}} on the War Labor Board, Feinsinger helped settle {{a number of}} {{important}} strikes. In November 1944, he settled a national strike by <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators</b> belonging to the National Federation of Telephone Workers which had shut down telephone service in Washington, D.C., Detroit and other large cities. Feinsinger told the union leaders that they were defying the government of the United States and [...] "no union has done that yet and succeeded." [...] On November 24, telephone workers in Dayton ended their walk-out and the nationwide strike collapsed. President Roosevelt specifically praised Feinsinger for his role in ending the dispute.|$|R
30|$|Evidence {{indicates}} the distance measure {{helps to explain}} differences in labor earnings that the dummies for mismatched and weakly matched individuals {{are not able to}} do. According to column (1) of Table  2, a computer scientist who works as a <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> <b>operator,</b> for example, has an earnings penalty equal to 27 % relative to an individual with the same degree who works as a systems analyst, which is classified as a close match between field of study and occupation, controlling for the characteristics included in the regression. The estimated earnings penalty is the same for another computer scientist who works as a physical and engineering science technician, for example. The comparison using estimates from column (1) {{does not take into account}} how activities performed by mismatched workers in their occupations are related to activities associated with their corresponding areas of study. The distance measure for a computer scientist who works as a <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> <b>operator</b> is 0.560, but 0.202 for an individual with the same degree who works as a physical and engineering science technician. Taking into account the estimated coefficient for Disti in column (3), the earnings penalty for the former individual is 30 %. For the latter individual, however, the estimated earnings penalty is about 10 %. In both cases, the estimated penalties associated with Disti represent one-third of the actual difference between mean hourly labor earnings for computer scientists in each of those two occupations relative to an appropriately matched computer scientist.|$|R

5|$|Hitler {{moved into}} the Führerbunker on 16 January 1945. He was joined by his senior staff, {{including}} Martin Bormann. In April 1945, Eva Braun and Joseph Goebbels {{moved into the}} Führerbunker while Magda Goebbels and their six children took residence in the upper Vorbunker. Two or three dozen support, medical, and administrative staff were also sheltered there. These included Hitler's secretaries (including Traudl Junge), a nurse named Erna Flegel, and <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> <b>operator</b> Sergeant Rochus Misch. Early on, Hitler continued to utilize the undamaged wing of the Reich Chancellery, where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study. Afterwards, he would have tea with his secretaries before going {{back down into the}} bunker complex for the night. After several weeks of this routine, Hitler seldom left the bunker except for short strolls in the chancellery garden with his dog Blondi. The bunker was crowded and the atmosphere was oppressive; air raids occurred daily. Hitler mostly stayed on the lower level, where it was quieter and he could sleep. Conferences took place for much of the night, often until 05:00.|$|R
50|$|Having left Paris in {{the autumn}} of 1952, Godard {{returned}} to Switzerland and went to live with his mother in Lausanne. He became friendly with his mother's lover, Jean-Pierre Laubscher, who was a labourer on the Grande Dixence Dam. Through Laubscher he secured work himself as a construction worker at the Plaz Fleuri work site at the dam. He saw the possibility of making a documentary film about the dam and when his initial contract ended, in order to prolong his time at the dam, moved to the post of <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> <b>operator.</b> It was whilst on duty, in April 1954, that he put through a call to Laubscher that relayed the fact that Odile Monod, his mother, had died in a scooter accident. Thanks to Swiss friends who lent him a 35mm movie camera, he was able to shoot on 35mm film. He rewrote the commentary that Laubscher had written, and gave his film a rhyming title Opération béton (Operation concrete). The company that administered the dam bought the film and used it for publicity purposes.|$|R

50|$|A <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> is a {{telecommunications}} system {{used in the}} {{public switched telephone network}} or in enterprises to interconnect circuits of telephones to establish telephone calls between the subscribers or users, or between other exchanges.
