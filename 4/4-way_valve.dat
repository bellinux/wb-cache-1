50|$|On Trilogy Autocockers, {{the front}} block is removed, and the {{pneumatics}} are attached directly {{on to the}} body. The <b>4-way</b> <b>valve</b> is also integrated into the body and cannot be replaced with third-party upgrades. This lack of the front block allows them to be produced at lower cost while decreasing complexity. However, upgrades to the marker {{can be a bit}} more difficult because of this. For example, an adapter is needed to allow the use of standard LPR's, and specialized pump kits are required to make a Trilogy a pump gun.|$|E
50|$|Within the Trilogy Autococker line, {{there are}} three models, the Pro, Competition, and Sport. Variations such as the Trilogy Tactical have the same basic {{mechanical}} components; changes are mostly cosmetic. The Trilogy Pro and Tactical models are available with an electronic frame called Trilogy Select Fire. This {{is different from the}} separately available WorrFrame Select Fire, such as {{can be found on the}} 2005 Black Magic model. The Trilogy Select Fire, uses the <b>4-way</b> <b>valve</b> integrated into the body of the gun rather than an electronic solenoid like other electronic frames.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{component}} is the <b>4-way</b> <b>valve,</b> {{known simply as}} a 4-way. The valve {{is commonly known as}} a 3-way valve because it has 3 visible ports, but this is technically incorrect. It is linked to the trigger via a short timing rod and activated when the trigger is pulled. The 4-way features three barbs on top, two of which are connected via small hoses to either end of the ram, and one of which is connected to the LPR. Gas from the LPR enters the 4-way through the center barb. Inside the 4-way is a small sliding rod (or [...] "spool") with 2 or 3 o-rings forming flow chambers that link the center barb to {{one or the other of}} the outer barbs depending on its position. No more than two barbs are linked at any given time.|$|E
50|$|The VN750 {{remained}} largely unchanged throughout its 22-year production run with only minor {{adjustments to the}} components and varying paint schemes. The VN750 was unique in its class by featuring a more reliable shaft drive usually found on larger cruisers. The bike also featured a liquid-cooled DOHC V-twin engine producing 66 horsepower and a flat 47 ft-lbs of torque {{throughout most of the}} rpm range, although the engine was underrated and commonly produced 8-10% more than the advertised power in dynomometer testing. The bike was configured to support an upright riding position with a king/queen seat and a factory installed sissy bar. The VN750 also featured adjustable air shocks front and rear, with Showa <b>4-way</b> <b>valving</b> on the rear.|$|R
5000|$|Multi-port {{ball valves}} with 4 ways, or more, are also commercially available, the inlet way often being {{orthogonal}} {{to the plane}} of the outlets. For special applications, such as driving air-powered motors from forward to reverse, the operation is performed by rotating a single lever four-way <b>valve.</b> The <b>4-way</b> ball <b>valve</b> has two L-shaped ports in the ball that do not interconnect, sometimes referred to as an [...] "Ã—" [...] port.|$|R
50|$|Internally, the Ion {{features}} a spool-valve design, {{similar to a}} Shocker SFT or a Dye Matrix. However, {{the operation of the}} Ion is somewhat simpler than a Shocker SFT or Matrix in that it does not use a <b>4-way</b> solenoid <b>valve.</b> The Ion's solenoid valve only has three hoses: one to provide air to the solenoid, one to provide air to a reservoir chamber behind the bolt, and the other which provides air {{to the front of the}} bolt to hold it back while the marker is at rest. The solenoid thus directs air either to the front of the bolt when not firing, or to the air reservoir behind the bolt, to blow it forward.|$|R
