Argentina advanced to the quarter-final with four wins, placing behind Lithuania in the group stage, after defeating Russia.

Freeman was the home favourite for the 400 m title at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, where she was expected to face-off with rival Pérec. This showdown never happened, as Pérec left the Games after what she describes as harassment from strangers. Freeman won the Olympic title {{in a time of}} 49.11 seconds, becoming only the second Australian Aboriginal Olympic champion (the first was Freeman's 4x400 teammate Nova Peris-Kneebone who won for field hockey <b>4</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier</b> in Atlanta). After the race, Freeman took a victory lap, carrying both the Aboriginal and Australian flags. This was despite the fact that unofficial flags are banned at the Olympic Games and the Aboriginal flag, while recognised as official in Australia, is not a national flag, nor recognised by the International Olympic Committee. Freeman also made the final of the 200 m, coming sixth. In honour of her gold medal win in Sydney, she represented Oceania in carrying the Olympic flag at the opening ceremonies of the next Olympics, in Salt Lake City, joining Archbishop Desmond Tutu (Africa), John Glenn (The Americas), Kazuyoshi Funaki (Asia), Lech Wałęsa (Europe), Jean-Michel Cousteau (Environment), Jean-Claude Killy (Sport), and Steven Spielberg (Culture).|$|E

40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated associations between fetal growth in late pregnancy and postnatal bone mass. However, {{the relationships between}} the intrauterine and early postnatal skeletal growth trajectory remain unknown. We addressed this in a large population-based mother-offspring cohort study. A total of 628 mother-offspring pairs were recruited from the Southampton Women's Survey. Fetal abdominal circumference was measured at 11, 19 and 34 weeks gestation using high-resolution ultrasound with femur length assessed at 19 and 34 weeks. Bone mineral content was measured postnatally in the offspring using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at birth and 4 years; postnatal linear growth was assessed at birth, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months. Late pregnancy abdominal circumference growth (19 - 34 weeks) was strongly (P < 0. 01) related to bone mass at birth, but less robustly associated with bone mass at <b>4</b> <b>years.</b> <b>Early</b> pregnancy growth (11 - 19 weeks) was more strongly related to bone mass at <b>4</b> <b>years</b> than at birth.

Sustained management oversight led to reductions in on-order and on-hand excess inventory in fiscal year 2010 prior to the Plans implementation, and thus DOD may find the current targets are not meaningful in guiding improvement. Specifically, at the end of fiscal year 2010, DOD had reduced its percentage of on-order excess inventory to 5. 5 percent, thereby achieving its 2014 target <b>4</b> <b>years</b> <b>early.</b> It also revised the definition and calculation of on-hand excess inventory, which resulted in DOD being below the fiscal year 2012 target of 10 percent.

For boys, individual velocity curves were used to operationally define maturity groups: early-decreasing velocities from 11 to 14 years, n = 9; average-velocities reaching a peak and then decreasing, n = 7; and late-increasing velocities from 11 to 14 years, n = 31. The distributions of stages of genital and public hair development were consistent with early, average and late maturity status designation based on velocities of stature growth.
