40|$|Epoxy-silica nanocomposites were {{obtained}} from directly blending diglycidylether of bisphenol-A and nanoscale colloidal silica and then curing with <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> <b>-diaminodiphenylmethane.</b> The epoxy-silica nanocompoites showed good transparency and miscibility observed with AFM, SEM, and TEM. The thermal stability of the epoxy resins was improved with the incorporation of the colloidal silica. However, a depression on the glass transition temperature of the resins was observed, owing to the plasticizing effect of the colloidal silica. Moreover, the nanoscale colloidal silica did not show effectively synergistic effect on char formation and flame retardance with phosphorus. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

The thermal properties and thermal degradation behaviors of these thermosetted resins were investigated by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).

We characterized these synthesized reactive modifiers using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and mass spectrometry. During the thermosetting processes, we reacted the epoxy curing agents <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> <b>-diaminodiphenylmethane</b> and tris(4 -aminophenyl) amine with the multiply hydrogen-bonding reactive modifiers and epoxy monomers. The introduction of the DOPO segment, strongly hydrogen bonding malonamide linkages, and hard aromatic groups into the backbones of the synthesized reactive modifiers resulted in epoxy networks exhibiting tailorable crosslinking densities, flexibilities, glass transition temperatures, thermal decomposition temperatures, and flame retardancies. Furthermore, dynamic mechanical analyses indicated that intermolecular hydrogen bonding of these reactive modifiers enhanced the thermal and physical properties of their epoxy resins through the formation of unique pseudocrosslinked polymer networks.

They were then characterized by IR, H- 1 NMR, elemental analysis, and X-ray crystallography, which suggested {{that all of them}} exist as the pyrazolone-enamine forms in the solid state and in a DMSO solution through tautomeric reactions. The nine compounds (compounds 1 - 9) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the proliferation of human liver cancer HepG 2 cells. Compounds 5, 6, 7 and 8 demonstrated a strong inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HepG 2 cells. The nine compounds can also inhibit the activity of the human cancer cellular 20 S proteasome. Further studies on compound 6 as the representative indicate that it can cause the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and the proteasome target proteins Bax and p 27, and exhibit a cytostatic effect in HepG 2 cells in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. The four potential tautomers of compound 6 were optimized and their single point energies were calculated by the density functional theory (DFT) B 3 LYP method based on the polarized continuum model (PCM) in water to identify the most likely tautomer existing in cancer cells. Based on the optimized structure of the most stable tautomer in water, the Wiberg bond orders, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps and frontier molecular orbital were calculated. As compounds 5, 6, 7 and 8 have hydroxyl in the ortho-position or meta-position, our study can provide some information to study their anticancer mechanism and the substitution effect of different functional groups...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Epoxy {{polyhedral}} oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) -based hybrid nanocomposites were pre-pared by in situ polymerization of {{a homogeneous}} blend of the diglycidylether of bisphenol-A and <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> <b>-diaminodiphenylmethane</b> (DDM) {{in the presence}} of octa(maleimidophenyl) silsesquioxane. The reaction of a maleimido-functionalized POSS cube with the epoxy resin was studied by Fourier transform infrared analysis and the formation of nanocomposites was confirmed by wide-angle X-ray diffraction and scan-ning electron microscopy. Dynamic mechanical analysis studies indicated that the crosslinking structures of the nanocomposite networks were predominantly formed between the terminal maleimide double bonds and the amino groups of DDM through a Michael addition reaction to form an aspartimide. The values of the glass transition temperatures (Tg) decreased with increasing POSS-maleimide content and this was likely to be due to the inclusion of POSS cages into the system and the consequent increase in free vol-ume. The dynamic thermal stability of the cured polymers was increased by increasing the POSS content in the hybrid epoxy matrices as evidenced from thermogravimetric analysis data.

40|$|A high {{performance}} polybenzoxazine derived from bio-based furfurylamine was synthesized in an efficient and straightforward way. For comparison, its petroleum-based analogue was also prepared from <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> <b>-diaminodiphenylmethane</b> (DDM).

Results demonstrated that the polybenzoxazine based on furfurylamine (BZ-F) possessed higher glass transition temperature (270 degrees C) and better thermal stability associated with higher charring ability {{when compared with the}} one (BZ-DDM) derived from DDM, which might be attributed to the stronger hydrogen bonding interaction in the BZ-F system and the post-curing reaction on furan ring above 280 degrees C.

This polymer was miscible with {{diglycidyl ether}} of bisphenol A (DGEBA), the precursor of epoxy resin. The miscibility {{is considered to}} be due mainly to entropy contribution because the molecular weight of DGEBA is quite low. The blends of epoxy resin with PSE were prepared through in situ curing reaction of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> <b>-diaminodiphenylmethane</b> (DDM) in the presence of PSE. The DDM-cured epoxy resin/PSE blends with PSE content up to 40 wt % were obtained. The reaction started from the initial homogeneous ternary mixture of DGEBA/DDM/PSE. With curing proceeding, phase separation induced by polymerization occurred. PSE was immiscible with the 4, 4 -diaminodiphenylmethane-cured epoxy resin (ER) because the blends exhibited two separate glass transition temperatures (Tgs) as revealed by the means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). SEM showed that all the ER/PSE blends are heterogeneous. Depending on blend composition, the blends can display PSE- or epoxy-dispersed morphologies, respectively. The mechanical test showed that the DDM-cured ER/PSE blend containing 25 wt % PSE displayed a substantial improvement in Izod impact strength, i. e., epoxy resin was significantly toughened. The improvement in impact toughness corresponded to the formation of PSE-dispersed phase structure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Radiofrequencies (27. 12 MHz) or RF {{are used}} to {{activate}} the curing reaction of a DGEBA epoxy resin in presence of <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> <b>-diaminodiphenylmethane</b> as cross-linking agent. The article is divided into four parts. The introduction {{is devoted to the}} presentation of the principle of the RF activation of the processing of the epoxy prepolymers. Afterwards, in the experimental part, the applied electromagnetic technology is described, and the polymerization experiments are carefully detailed. The samples to be ir-radiated are placed inside an applicator of condenser type, which consists in two parallel steel plates used as electrodes. When the plates are put at an alternating electrical potential of frequency of 27. 12 MHz, the phenomenon of dipolar relaxation inside the chemical mixture is activated. Thus, a part of the initial electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy, which is itself converted into heat because of in-ternal friction. Consequently, the temperature of the samples grows and, as soon as their thermal level is sufficiently high, the reaction of curing works. An extended parametrical study of this reaction, carried out at given electrical voltage or dielectric loss, is described. The determination of the glassy transition temperature of all final products shows that no structural difference is detectable between the epoxy net-works issued from the activation processes using radiofrequencies or classical heating inside an oven, that is to say there is no specific effect of the electromagnetic field on the structure of the crosslinked epoxy materials...|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} of new spin-crossover (SCO) compounds {{plays an important}} role in understanding the key design factors involved, informing the synthesis of materials for future applications in electronic and sensing devices. In this report, three bis-bidentate ligands were synthesized by Schiff base condensation of imidazole- 4 -carbaldehyde with <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> <b>-diaminodiphenylmethane</b> (L 1), 4, 4 ′-diaminodiphenyl sulfide (L 2) and 4, 4 ′-diaminodiphenyl ether (L 3) respectively. Their dinuclear Fe(II) triple helicates were obtained by complexation with Fe(BF 4) 2 · 6 H 2 O in acetonitrile. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of the steric nature of the ligand central atom (–X–, where X = CH 2, S or O) on the spin-crossover profile of the compound. The magnetic behaviours of these compounds were investigated and subsequently correlated to the structural information from single-crystal X-ray crystallographic experiments. All compounds [Fe 2 (L 1) 3](BF 4) 2 (1), [Fe 2 (L 2) 3](BF 4) 2 (2) and [Fe 2 (L 3) 3](BF 4) 2 (3), demonstrated approximately half-spin transitions, with T 1 / 2 values of 155, 115 and 150 K respectively, corresponding to one high-spin (HS) and one low-spin (LS) Fe(II) centre in a [LS–HS] state at 50 K. This was also confirmed by crystallographic studies, for example, bond lengths and the octahedral distortion parameter (∑) at 100 K. The three-dimensional arrangement of the HS and LS Fe(II) centres throughout the crystal lattice was different for the three compounds, and differing extents of intermolecular interactions between BF 4 − counter ions and imidazole N–H were present. The three compounds displayed similar spin-transition profiles, with 2 (–S–) possessing the steepest nature. The shape of the spin transition can be altered in this manner, and this is likely due to the subtle effects that the steric nature of the central atom has on the crystal packing (and thus inter-helical Fe–Fe separation), intermolecular interactions and Fe–Fe intra-helical separations...|$|E

Patch test results suggested that the volunteers were actively sensitized to <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> '-MDI following the dermal uptake study, as they reacted positively to <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> '-MDA, a marker for <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> '-MDI allergy. No positive reactions were seen to PPD or DMDI. Chemical investigation confirmed that the correct concentration had been used for the dermal uptake study, and showed that about 70 % of the applied <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> '-MDI was not absorbed. Conclusions. A dermal uptake study with <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> '-MDI in 2. 0 % pet. with an occlusion time of 8 hr induced active sensitization to <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> '-MDI and subsequently to <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> '-MDA...|$|R

Three identified metabolites {{resulting from the}} degradation of either acaricide, were <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> ′-dichlorobenzilic acid, <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> ′-dichlorobenzophenone, and carbon dioxide. Chlorobenzilate, i. e., ethyl ester of <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> ′-dichlorobenzilic acid, was more easily hydrolyzed than Chloropropylate, i. e., isopropyl ester of this acid, so that larger amounts {{of carbon dioxide and}} <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> ′-dichlorobenzophenone were obtained from Chlorobenzilate degradation. Regardless of acaricides used, longer incubation caused a higher accumulation of <b>4,</b> <b>4</b> ′-dichlorobenzophenone.
