5000|$|For example, a <b>4-wire</b> <b>circuit</b> may, {{by means}} of a 4-wire {{terminating}} set, be connected to a 2-wire telephone set. Also, a pair of 4-wire terminating sets may be used to introduce an intermediate <b>4-wire</b> <b>circuit</b> into a 2-wire circuit, in which loop repeaters may be situated to amplify signals in each direction without positive feedback and oscillation.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} voting comparators {{relied on}} a tone encoded on a separate audio path, requiring each receiver site to have a <b>4-wire</b> <b>circuit</b> or two audio paths. The pitch of the tone changed to represent the received signal level, or FM receiver limiter voltage, at the remote receiver. This worked poorly {{because it did not}} account for microwave baseband noise or noisy telephone company circuits.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Fig. 5. Microphones {{connected}} to star quad cablejoin together diametrically opposite conductors to maintain balance. This {{is different from}} the usage on <b>4-wire</b> <b>circuits.</b> The colours in this diagram correspond with the colouring in figure 2.|$|R
50|$|When {{both the}} 2-wire and the <b>4-wire</b> <b>circuits</b> must be balanced, double {{transformer}} hybrids are used, as shown at right. Signal into port W splits between X and Z, {{but due to}} reversed connection to the windings, cancel at port Y. Signal into port X goes to W and Y. But due to reversed connection to ports W and Y, Z gets no signal. Thus the pairs, W & Y, X & Z, are conjugates.|$|R
50|$|Telephone trunk lines, and {{especially}} frequency division multiplexing carrier systems, are usually <b>4-wire</b> <b>circuits</b> rather than 2-wire circuits (or {{at least they}} were before fibre-optic became widespread) and require a different kind of cable. This format requires the conductors to be arranged in two pairs, one pair for the sending (go) signal and the other for the return signal. The greatest source of interference on this kind of transmission is usually the crosstalk between the go and return circuits themselves. The most common cable format is star quad, where the diagonally opposite conductors form the pairs. This geometry gives maximum common mode rejection between the two pairs. An alternative format is DM quad which consists of two twisted pairs with the twisting at different pitches.|$|R
50|$|In the new infrastructure, IRCs were {{connected}} to the UDC in a star network configuration, originally via leased line permanent (not packet switched) connections, based on the X25 protocol, operating at 2.4 kilobits per second (kbit/s). By mid 1981, these private circuit links had been replaced with dedicated <b>4-wire</b> X25 <b>circuits</b> over the new public Packet Switch Stream (PSS) network operating at 4.8 kbit/s.|$|R
50|$|A Kelvin clip is {{a special}} form of {{crocodile}} clip. The jaws of a Kelvin clip are insulated from each other, allowing 2 isolated wires to connect to a single test point. This enables <b>4-wire</b> measurement of <b>circuits</b> with very low resistances.|$|R
50|$|Audio {{transformers}} {{are those}} {{specifically designed for}} use in audio circuits to carry audio signal. They {{can be used to}} block radio frequency interference or the DC component of an audio signal, to split or combine audio signals, or to provide impedance matching between high impedance and low impedance circuits, such as between a high impedance tube (valve) amplifier output and a low impedance loudspeaker, or between a high impedance instrument output and the low impedance input of a mixing console. Audio transformers that operate with loudspeaker voltages and current are larger than those that operate at microphone or line level, which carry much less power. Bridge transformers connect 2-wire and <b>4-wire</b> communication <b>circuits.</b>|$|R
