50|$|Aminopterin (or 4-aminopteroic acid), the <b>4-amino</b> {{derivative}} of folic acid, is an antineoplastic drug with immunosuppressive properties {{often used in}} chemotherapy. Aminopterin is a synthetic {{derivative of}} pterin. Aminopterin works as an enzyme inhibitor by competing for the folate binding site of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. Its binding affinity for dihydrofolate reductase effectively blocks tetrahydrofolate synthesis. This results in the depletion of nucleotide precursors and inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis.|$|E
5000|$|The name Starlicide {{originated}} as {{a registered}} trademark {{of the animal}} feed manufacturer Ralston-Purina in St. Louis, Missouri.Starlicide is a small molecule in which a central benzene ring is modified by amine, chloro and methyl substituents in a specific pattern. Because special names exist for benzene rings modified {{with one or two}} of these functional groups, several synonymous chemical names may be encountered: 3-chloro-4-methylaniline or 3-chloro-4-methylbenzenamine, 2-chloro-4-aminotoluene, or 3-chloro-p-toluidine. [...] Numbered groups (2-chloro, <b>4-amino)</b> also may be named out of order; the numbers of such groups equal the number of carbon atoms in the benzene ring separating them from the group implied in the special name.|$|E
5000|$|Caspase-3 shares many of {{the typical}} {{characteristics}} common to all currently-known caspases. For example, its active site contains a cysteine residue (Cys-163) and histidine residue (His-121) that stabilize the peptide bond cleavage of a protein sequence to the carboxy-terminal side of an aspartic acid when {{it is part of}} a particular <b>4-amino</b> acid sequence. [...] This specificity allows caspases to be incredibly selective, with a 20,000-fold preference for aspartic acid over glutamic acid. [...] A key feature of caspases in the cell is that they are present as zymogens, termed procaspases, which are inactive until a biochemical change causes their activation. Each procaspase has an N-terminal large subunit of about 20 kDa followed by a smaller subunit of about 10 kDa, called p20 and p10, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Computational {{chemistry}} {{techniques were}} used to probe the active site of the enzyme, {{in an attempt to}} design derivatives of DANA that would bind tightly to the amino acid residues of the catalytic site, so would be potent and specific inhibitors of the enzyme. The GRID software by Molecular Discovery was used to determine energetically favourable interactions between various functional groups and residues in the catalytic site canyon. This investigation showed a negatively charged zone occurs in the neuraminidase active site that aligns with the C4 hydroxyl group of DANA. This hydroxyl is, therefore, replaced with a positively charged amino group; the <b>4-amino</b> DANA was shown to be 100 times better as an inhibitor than DANA, owing to the formation of a salt bridge with a conserved glutamic acid (119) in the active site. Glu 119 was also noticed to be {{at the bottom of a}} conserved pocket in the active site that is just big enough to accommodate the larger, but more basic guanidine functional group. Zanamivir, a transition-state analogue inhibitor of neuraminidase, was the result.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme forms a 45-kDa {{homodimer}} of two 22-kDa subunits {{composed of}} a core domain and cap domain. The core domain is an α/β Rossmann-like fold containing six antiparallel β-strands surrounded by α-helixes, and it spans residues 1-17 and 77-201 of the amino acid sequence. The cap domain is a 4-helix bundle spanning residues 18-76. The cleft formed by the core and cap domains acts as the enzyme’s active site, where three conserved motifs in the core domain plus the cofactor Mg2+ serve as the substrate binding site. Meanwhile, the residues Phe18, Phe44, Leu45, and Tyr65 in the cap domain form an aromatic, hydrophobic pocket that coordinates with {{the base of the}} nucleotide substrate and, thus, influences the enzyme’s substrate specificity. Its two main chain amides form hydrogen bonds with the 4-carbonyl group of dUMP and dTMP and with the 6-carbonyl group of dGMP and dIMP, while repelling the <b>4-amino</b> group of dCMP and dAMP. The residue Asp43 is responsible for donating a proton to O5’ of the nucleotide during catalysis.|$|E
50|$|Uridine-cytidine kinase 2 is a tetramer with {{molecular}} mass of about 112 kDa. In the UCK2 monomer, the active site {{is composed of}} a five-stranded β-sheet, surrounded by five α-helices and a β-hairpin loop. The β-hairpin loop in particular forms {{a significant portion of}} a deep binding pocket for the uridine/cytidine substrate to moderate binding and release of substrate and products. Binding specificity for nucleosides is determined by the His-117 and Tyr-112 residues, which hydrogen bond with the <b>4-amino</b> group or the 6-oxo group of cytidine and uridine, respectively. A magnesium ion is coordinated in the active site by Glu-135, Ser-34, and Asp-62. The Asp-62 residue is responsible for the catalytic activity in the enzyme active site; the acidic side chain of the Asp-62 residue deprotonates the 5’-hydroxyl group on the substrate and activates it to attack the γ-phosphorus of ATP. Structural analyses have shown that the side chain of the catalytic Asp-62 changes conformation before and after the reaction. It has been suggested that this conformational change occurs following phosphorylation, with the negatively charged Asp-62 moving away from the newly attached 5’-phosphate of the UMP/CMP product.|$|E
