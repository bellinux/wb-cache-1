40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe industrial mission of Destroyer Tenders (AD) and Repair Ships (AR) {{is to provide}} intermediate level maintenance and repair for supported ships. The Tender and Repair Ship <b>Load</b> <b>List</b> for these ships (AD/AR TARSLL) designates the range (number) and depth (quantity) of repair parts to be carried to support this industrial mission. This thesis details the logical reasoning and mathematical theory used to develop the 1977 AD/AR TARSLL, including {{an analysis of the}} data development, the mathematical inventory model and procedures used, and various assumptions and constraints applied during the process. Actual demand history for the six AD/AR 1 s in the Atlantic fleet for a two year period from 1977 to 1979 was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the <b>load</b> <b>list.</b> The effects of certain assumptions in the model on the <b>load</b> <b>list</b> were analyzed.

40|$|AbstractMutations in RecQL 4 are a {{causative factor}} in Rothmund–Thomson syndrome, a human {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterized by premature aging. To study {{the role of}} RecQL 4, we employed a cell-free experimental system consisting of Xenopus egg extracts. RecQL <b>4</b> <b>loading</b> onto chromatin was observed regardless of {{the presence or absence}} of EcoRI. However, in the absence of EcoRI, RecQL <b>4</b> <b>loading</b> was suppressed by geminin, an inhibitor of pre-replicative complex formation, while in the presence of EcoRI, it was not affected. These results suggest that under the former condition, RecQL 4 -loading depended on DNA replication, while under the latter, the interaction occurred in response to double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) induced by EcoRI. DSB-induced RecQL <b>4</b> <b>loading</b> depended on the function of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and replication protein A, while there were only minor changes in DNA replication-associated RecQL <b>4</b> <b>loading</b> upon suppression of these proteins. Furthermore, analyses using a chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay and quantification of γH 2 AX after induction of DSBs suggested that RecQL <b>4</b> is <b>loaded</b> adjacent to Ku heterodimer-binding sites on damaged chromatin, and functions in the repair of DSBs...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPresently, aircraft carriers on deployment request Fleet Issue <b>Load</b> <b>List</b> (FILL) material from supporting AFS ships on a "Fill or Kill" basis. If {{the material is}} available on the AFS, it is issued and delivered to the aircraft carrier during the next underway replenishment (UNREP). If the requested material is not-in-stock (NIS) the requisition is cancelled by the AFS. The aircraft carrier is notified of requisition cancellations during the underway replenishment. The aircraft carrier then cancels the outstanding requisition on its own inventory system, and reorders the material at the next scheduled underway replenishment or from an appropriate Naval Supply Center. This thesis suggests a procedure for an AFS to automatically forward cancelled aircraft carrier requisitions for Fleet Issue <b>Load</b> <b>List</b> material to a Navy Supply Center. During the study information was obtained from several on-site visits to an AFS and an in-depth review of current guidelines and procedures for AFS supply support and aircraft carrier requisitioning procedures.

40|$|Patients with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4) -responsive {{phenylalanine}} hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency {{may benefit}} from BH 4 therapy instead or {{in addition to the}} low-phenylalanine diet. Different loading test protocols are currently used to detect these patients. As a consequence, data on the rate of BH 4 -responsiveness within patients with mild phenylketonuria (PKU) and/or more severe phenotypes show high variation and a more sensitive and standardised BH <b>4</b> <b>loading</b> test protocol needs to be defined. We modified the current standard BH <b>4</b> <b>loading</b> test (20 mg/kg) to a second administration of 20 mg/kg after 24 h and extended blood sampling to 48 h in 24 patients with PAH deficiency. Using this extended loading test (2 x 20 mg BH 4 /kg), the rate of BH 4 -responsiveness was calculated at 8, 24, and 48 h after BH 4 administration. We defined three groups of patients: "rapid responders" in 10 / 24 patients (4 mild HPA, 2 mild PKU, 2 moderate PKU, and 2 classic PKU), "moderate responders" in 4 / 24 patients (4 classic PKU), and "slow responder" in 4 / 24 patients (4 mild PKU). Six out of 24 patients (1 mild HPA, 1 moderate PKU, and 4 classic PKU) were found to be "non-responder. " Individual phenylalanine profiles show variations in responsiveness at different time points and sampling over 48 h was more informative than over 24 h in patients with mild and moderate PKU compared to mild HPA. Analysis of BH <b>4</b> <b>loading</b> tests in 209 patients with the standard BH <b>4</b> <b>loading</b> test protocol confirms only minor importance of the 24 h response: the rate of responsiveness to BH 4 after 24 h was shown to be equal to or even lower than after 8 h among most phenotypes. However, extension of the BH <b>4</b> <b>loading</b> test to 48 h and repeated BH 4 administration seems to be useful to detect BH 4 -responsiveness in more severe phenotypes and allows detecting "slow responders" who {{may benefit from}} BH 4 therapy...|$|R

40|$|Background: How to {{efficiently}} diagnose tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4) responsiveness {{in patients}} with phenylketonuria remains unclear. This study investigated the positive predictive value (PPV) of the 48 -hour BH <b>4</b> <b>loading</b> test and the additional value of genotype. Methods: Data of the 48 -hour BH <b>4</b> <b>loading</b> test (20 mg BH 4 /kg/day) were collected at six Dutch university hospitals. Patients with >= 30 % phenylalanine reduction at >= 1 time points during the 48 hours (potential responders) were invited for the BH 4 extension phase, designed to establish true-positive BH 4 responsiveness. This is defined as long-term >= 30 % reduction in mean phenylalanine concentration and/or >= 4 g/day and/or >= 50 % increase of natural protein intake. Genotype was collected if available. Results: 177 / 183 patients successfully completed the 48 -hour BH <b>4</b> <b>loading</b> test. 80 / 177 were potential responders and 67 / 80 completed the BH 4 extension phase. In 58 / 67 true-positive BH 4 responsiveness was confirmed (PPV 87 %). The genotype was available for 120 / 177 patients. 41 / 44 patients with = 1 mutation associated with long-term BH 4 responsiveness showed potential BH 4 responsiveness in the 48 -hour test and 34 / 41 completed the BH 4 extension phase. In 33 / 34 true-positive BH 4 responsiveness was confirmed. 4 / 40 patients with two known putative null mutations were potential responders; 2 / 4 performed the BH 4 extension phase but showed no true-positive BH 4 responsiveness. Conclusions: The 48 -hour BH <b>4</b> <b>loading</b> test in combination with a classified genotype is a good parameter in predicting true-positive BH 4 responsiveness. We propose assessing genotype first, particularly in the neonatal period. Patients with two known putative null mutations can be excluded from BH 4 testing. ...|$|R

40|$|APOE ɛ 4 is the best-established genetic {{risk factor}} for {{sporadic}} Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, while homozygotes show greater disease susceptibility and earlier age of onset than heterozygotes, they may not show faster rates of clinical progression. We hypothesize that there are differential APOE ɛ 4 allele-load dependent influences on neuropathology across the brain. Our aim was to define the relationship between APOE ɛ <b>4</b> allele <b>load</b> and regionally-specific brain cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). For this reason voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed using T 1 -weighted MR images from 83 AD patients, contrasting regional cortical grey matter by APOE ɛ <b>4</b> <b>load</b> according to either dominant or genotypic models. Patients fulfilled NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and were genotyped for APOE ɛ 4 (15 ɛ 4 /ɛ 4, 39 ɛ 4 /− and 29 −/−). We observed that grey matter volume (GMV) decreased additively with increasing allele load in the medial (MTL) and anterior temporal lobes bilaterally. By contrast, a 2 degree-of-freedom genotypic model suggested a dominant effect of the APOE ɛ 4 allele in the left temporal lobe. Brain regions showing a significant APOE ɛ <b>4</b> allele <b>load</b> effect on GMV in AD included only some of those typically described as having greatest amyloid plaque deposition and atrophy. Temporal regions appeared to show a dominant effect of APOE ɛ <b>4</b> allele <b>load</b> instead of the additive effect previously strongly associated with age of onset.

In patients 1 and 2 a tetrahydrobiopterin (BH <b>4)</b> <b>load</b> caused a significant decrease of the plasma Phe levels. A combined phenylalanine/BH <b>4</b> <b>loading</b> test was performed in patients 2, 3 and 4. In the latter two patients, plasma Phe concentrations completely normalized within 8 h after the BH <b>4</b> <b>load</b> (20 mg/kg). Basal urinary pterins were normal in all four patients. The activity of dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) was normal in patients 1, 2 and 3 and 50 % of control values in patient 4 (not {{in the range of}} DHPR-deficient patients). In patient 3 a subsequent phenylalanine loading test with concomitant analysis of plasma biopterins revealed a normal increase of biopterin, excluding a BH 4 biosynthesis defect. Pterins and neurotransmitter metabolites in CSF of patients 1, 3 and 4 were normal.

40|$|Landfills {{are a major}} {{anthropogenic}} source of the greenhouse gas methane (CH 4). However, much of the CH 4 produced during the anaerobic degradation of organic waste is consumed by methanotrophic micro-organisms during passage through the landfill-cover soil. On a section of a closed landfill near Liestal, Switzerland, we performed experiments to compare CH 4 fluxes obtained by different methods {{at or above the}} cover-soil surface with below-ground fluxes, and to link methanotrophic activity to estimates of CH <b>4</b> ingress (<b>loading)</b> from the waste body at selected locations. Fluxes of CH 4 into or out of the cover soil were quantified by eddy-covariance and static flux-chamber measurements. In addition. CH 4 concentrations at the soil surface were monitored using a field-portable FID detector. Near-surface CH 4 fluxes and CH <b>4</b> <b>loading</b> were estimated from soil-gas concentration profiles in conjunction with radon measurements, and gas push-pull tests (GPPTs) were performed to quantify rates of microbial CH 4 oxidation. Eddy-covariance measurements yielded by far the largest and probably most representative estimates of overall CH 4 emissions from the test section (daily mean up to similar to 91, 500 mu mol m(- 2) d(- 1)), whereas flux-chamber measurements and CH 4 concentration profiles indicated that at the majority of locations the cover soil was a net sink for atmospheric CH 4 (uptake up to - 380 mu mol m(- 2) d(- 1)) during the experimental period. Methane concentration profiles also indicated strong variability in CH <b>4</b> <b>loading</b> over short distances in the cover soil, while potential methanotrophic activity derived from GPPTs was high (v(max) similar to 13 mmol L- 1 (soil air) h(- 1)) at a location with substantial CH <b>4</b> <b>loading.</b> Our results provide a basis to assess spatial and temporal variability of CH 4 dynamics in the complex terrain of a landfill-cover soil...|$|R
