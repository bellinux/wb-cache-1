Although affect is embraced by both science and engineering, its recognition has not reached a satisfying level. Through a concise overview of ASP and the automatic classification of affect, we provide understanding for the problems encountered. Next, we identify guidelines for ASP: 1) four approaches to validation: content, criteria-related, construct, and ecological, 2) identification of users, 3) triangulation, and <b>4)</b> <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> issues. Each of these guidelines is briefly touched upon in this paper. A more exhaustive discussion on these guidelines, in perspective of the invited speakers’ experience, will be provided through the session and its accompanying papers...|$|R

Low resolution images are being interpolated and then the interpolated images are being registered in order to generate a sharper high resolution image.

The quantitative peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) results {{as well as the}} visual results show the superiority of the proposed technique over the conventional and state-of-art image super resolution techniques.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present low-complexity blind multi-input multi-output (MIMO) {{adaptive}} linear multiuser receivers for direct sequence code {{division multiple access}} (DS-CDMA) systems using multiple transmit antennas and space-time block codes (STBC) in multipath channels. A space-time code-constrained constant modulus (CCM) design criterion based on constrained optimization techniques and low-complexity stochastic gradient (SG) adaptive algorithms are developed for estimating the parameters of the space-time linear receivers. The receivers are designed by exploiting the unique structure imposed by both spreading codes and STBC. A blind space-time channel estimation scheme for STBC systems based on a subspace approach is also proposed along with an efficient SG algorithm. Simulation results for a downlink scenario assess the receiver structures and algorithms and show that the proposed schemes achieve excellent performance, outperforming existing methods.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a widely-linear (WL) {{receiver}} structure for multiple access interference (MAI) and {jamming signal (JS) } suppression in direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) systems. A vector space projection (VSP) scheme is also considered {{to cancel the}} {JS} before detecting the desired signals. We develop a novel multiple-candidate successive interference cancellation (MC-SIC) scheme which processes two consecutive user symbols at one time to process the unreliable estimates {{and a number of}} selected points serve as the feedback candidates for interference cancellation, which is effective for alleviating the effect of error propagation in the SIC algorithm. Widely-linear <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> is then used to enhance the performance of the receiver in non-circular modulation scheme. By bringing together the techniques mentioned above, a novel interference suppression scheme is proposed which combines the widely-linear multiple-candidate SIC (WL-MC-SIC) minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) algorithm with the VSP scheme to suppress MAI and {JS} simultaneously. Simulations for binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation scenarios show that the proposed structure achieves a better MAI suppression performance compared with previously reported SIC MMSE receivers at lower complexity and a superior {JS} suppression performance.

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{investigated}} the feasibility {{and accuracy of}} a novel surgical marking system based on radiofrequency identification (RFID) technology for the localization of small peripheral lung nodules (SPLNs) in a canine model. MethodsThe system consists of 4 components: (1) micro RFID tags (13. 56 MHz, 1. 0  ×  1. 0  ×  0. 8 mm), (2) a tag delivery system with a bronchoscope, (3) a wand-shaped locating probe (10 -mm diameter), and (<b>4)</b> a <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> unit with audio interface. Before the operation, pseudolesions mimicking SPLNs were prepared in 7  dogs by injecting colored collagen. By use of a computed tomographic (CT) guide, an RFID tag was placed via a bronchoscope close to each target lesion. This was then followed by scanning with the locating probe, and wedge resection was performed when possible. Operators can locate the tag by following the sound emitted by the system, which exhibits tone changes according to the tag-probe distance. The primary outcome measure was the rate of wedge resection with good margins. ResultsA total of 10 pseudolesions imitating SPLNs were selected as targets. During thoracoscopic procedures, 9 of 10 tags were detected by the system within a median of 27 seconds. Wedge resections were performed for these 9 lesions with a median margin of 11 mm. The single failure was caused by tag dislocation to the central airway. ConclusionsSuccessful localization and wedge resection of pseudolesions with appropriate margins were accomplished in an experimental setting.
