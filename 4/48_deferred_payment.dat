5000|$|A debt is a {{deferred}} payment; {{a standard}} of <b>deferred</b> <b>payment</b> is what they are denominated in. Since the value of money - be it dollars, gold, or others - may fluctuate over time via inflation and deflation, the value of <b>deferred</b> <b>payments</b> (the real level of debt) likewise fluctuates.A device is termed [...] "legal tender" [...] if it may serve to discharge (pay off) debts; thus, while US dollars are not backed by gold or any other commodity, they draw value from being legal tender - being usable to pay off debts.|$|R

Otherwise, for example, a debtor might try to select a standard of <b>deferred</b> <b>payment</b> of debt that is forecast to drop in value so {{the real value of}} his payment to the lender will be lower. The lender can avoid this by selecting a denomination of debt that is forecast to maintain its value.|$|R

50|$|In January 2000 Bobby Bonilla's agent Dan Horwits {{negotiated}} {{his release}} from the New York Mets with general manager Steve Phillips, which involved undisclosed <b>deferred</b> <b>payments</b> to give the team flexibility to sign additional players. Later these payments were reported to be $1.19 million to be paid every year from 2011 to 2035 with Beverly Hills Sports Council and the Mets agreeing to an interest rate of 8 percent. The idea for the <b>deferred</b> <b>payment</b> was conceived earlier when BHSC partner Dennis Gilbert negotiated a similar deal with former Mets general manager Al Harazin for Bret Saberhagen in which the team would pay annual <b>deferred</b> <b>payments</b> of $250,000 for 25 years starting in 2004. In 2013 Jon Heyman of CBSSports.com revealed {{that there was an}} earlier arrangement with Bonilla from his first, record-setting 5-year, $29 million contract in 1991, in which BHSC and the Mets agreed on a 25-year payment plan for $500,000 a year that started in 2004 and goes through 2028.|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{implications}} of initial payment methods in earnout deals on acquirers’ gains. The results, which are robust to self-selection bias and alternative model specifications, reveal that earnout deals outperform non-earnout deals. The acquirers gain the most from earnout deals when both initial and <b>deferred</b> <b>payments</b> are in stocks. The positive wealth effect of the choice of initial payment method in earnout deals is more prominent in cross-border deals than in domestic deals. Overall, the earnout deals generate higher gains when both the initial and <b>deferred</b> <b>payments</b> help spread the risk between the shareholders of acquiring and target firms...|$|R

50|$|There is {{sufficient}} evidence of <b>deferred</b> <b>payments</b> and financing arrangements {{to be negotiated}} for large purchases. <b>Deferred</b> <b>payments</b> {{were used in the}} auction of wine or oil that was “on the tree” (not yet harvested or produced), requiring payment from the winning bidder long after the auction had ended. Roman peasants who needed money to pay their taxes would use an inverted form of this process by selling the right to a portion of their harvest in the future in exchange for cash in the present. The Sulpicii arose as professional bankers in the first century AD, and among other forms of financial intermediation, they offered financing for speculators in grain markets.|$|R
5000|$|Murabaḥah, murabaḥa or murâbaḥah (مرابحة, {{derived from}} ribh ربح, meaning profit) {{is a term}} of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) for a sales {{contract}} where the buyer and seller agree on the markup (profit) or [...] "cost-plus" [...] price for the item(s) being sold.

Murabaha financing is similar to a rent-to-own arrangement in the non-Muslim world, with the intermediary (i.e. the lending bank) retaining ownership of the item being sold until the loan is paid in full.|$|R
