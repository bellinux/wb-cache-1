The first episode's plot {{revolves}} around {{the growing popularity of}} Bob and Doug, and they are given their own variety show on SCTV, which turns into a catastrophe. The characters returned in the next episode for a new segment in their traditional studio set, but it had been cut to one minute (the episode's storyline owing the reduced air time to their disastrous variety show). The two are then featured in three more new segments, each back to two minutes long, before Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas left SCTV to film Strange Brew.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To assess {{objective}} {{response rates}} after <b>4</b> <b>cycles</b> of gemcitabine {{in combination with}} oxaliplatin {{in children and adolescents}} with relapsed or refractory solid tumours. METHODS: This multicentre, non-randomised Phase II study included five strata: neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, medulloblastoma and other CNS tumours strata with two-stage Simon designs and a miscellaneous, extra-cranial solid tumour stratum with descriptive design. Eligibility criteria included: age 6 months to 21 years; measurable, relapsed or refractory solid malignancy; no more than one previous salvage therapy. Gemcitabine was administered intravenously at 1000 mg/m(2) over 100 min followed by oxaliplatin at 100 mg/m(2) over 120 min on Day 1 of a 14 -d cycle. Tumour response was assessed every <b>4</b> <b>cycles</b> according to WHO criteria. RESULTS: Ninety-three out of 95 patients enrolled in 25 centres received treatment: 12 neuroblastoma; 12 osteosarcoma; 14 medulloblastoma; 13 other CNS tumours and 42 miscellaneous non-CNS solid tumours. Median age was 11. 7 years (range, 1. 3 - 20. 8 years). Tumour control (CR+PR+SD) at <b>4</b> <b>cycles</b> was obtained in 30 / 93 evaluable patients (32. 3...|$|R
40|$|The North-South {{asymmetry}} {{of solar}} activity is variable {{in time and}} strength. We analyse the long-term variation of the phase lags of hemispheric cycles and check a conjectured relationship between these phase lags and the hemispheric cycle strengths. Sunspot data are used from cycles 12 - 23 in which the separation of northern and southern hemispheres is possible. The centers of mass of the hemispheric cycle profiles were used to study the phase relations and relative strengths of the hemispheric cycles. This approach considers a cycle {{as a whole and}} disregards the short-term fluctuations of the cycle time profile. The phase of the hemispheric cycles shows an alternating variation: the northern <b>cycle</b> leads in <b>4</b> <b>cycles</b> and follows in <b>4</b> <b>cycles.</b> No significant relationship is found between the phase and strength differences of the hemispheric cycles. The period of <b>4</b> + <b>4</b> <b>cycles</b> appears to be close to the Gleissberg cycle and may provide a key to its physical background.

In advanced breast cancer patients liposomal anthracyclines (LA) have shown similar efficacy and less cardiac toxicity when compared to conventional anthracyclines. We performed this retrospective analysis in order to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of neoadjuvant regimens including LA outside of clinical trials in routine clinical practice. Methods: Fifty operable or locally advanced, HER 2 negative, breast cancer patients were retrospectively identified in 5 Italian cancer centres. Nineteen patients had received <b>4</b> <b>cycles</b> of non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (NPLD) and cyclophosphamide, followed by <b>4</b> <b>cycles</b> of docetaxel, every 3 weeks. In 25 patients the reverse sequence was employed, and a third subgroup of 6 patients received <b>4</b> <b>cycles</b> of NPLD/cyclophosphamide every 3 weeks followed by <b>4</b> <b>cycles</b> of weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel.
