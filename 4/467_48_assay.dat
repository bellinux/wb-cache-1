30|$|The current {{method of}} {{targeting}} for capillary sequencing is the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) (Saiki et al. 1985). This can equally be used for preparation of targets for NGS but owing to the massive capacity of these platforms very large numbers of PCRs are required to fill a run. The processing required can be limited by utilising multiplex PCR or long range PCR (Fredriksson et al. 2007; Varley and Mitra 2008). Commercial solutions to this problem include the RainStorm technology from RainDance Technologies which uses an emPCR approach to simultaneously amplify up to 4, 000 short DNA sequences in separate microdroplets (Tewhey et al. 2009), and the Access Array from Fluidigm which uses proprietary microfluidics to setup an array of 2, 304 PCRs (<b>48</b> samples ×  <b>48</b> <b>assays).</b> It {{should be noted that}} neither of these systems is actually multiplex as the individual reactions are separated—this enables much higher levels of parallelisation than are achievable in a single reaction.|$|R

Five demographic variables were also inquired. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analyses for the main outcome "acceptance of routine RV immunisation" and other variables were performed. Diffusion of innovation theory was used for data assessment. Nine-hundred seventy-seven questionnaires were returned (26 %). Fifty percent of participants were paediatricians. Routine RV immunisation was supported by 146 participants (15 %; so called early adopters), dismissed by 620 (64 %), leaving 211 (21 %) undecided. However, when asked whether they would recommend RV vaccination to parents if it were officially recommended by the federal authorities and reimbursed, <b>467</b> (<b>48.</b> 5 %; so called early majority) agreed to recommend RV immunisation. Multivariate analysis revealed that physicians who would immunise their own child (OR: 5. 1; 95 % CI: 4. 1 - 6. 3), hospital-based physicians (OR: 1. 6; 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 2. 3) and physicians from the French (OR: 1. 6; 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 2. 3) and Italian speaking areas of Switzerland (OR: 2. 5; 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 5. 8) were more likely to support RV immunisation.

40|$|Summary. -Single-cell {{suspensions}} {{prepared by}} enzymatic disaggregation of an immunogenic 3 -methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma (Mc 4 OA) contain {{a significant proportion}} of infiltrating leucocytes (42 %) comprising T lymphocytes, macrophages and non-phagocytic FcR+ lymphoid-like cells. Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were isolated and purified by successive passage over Sephadex G- 10 columns and their cytotoxic activity in vitro compared with that of lymphoid cells from normal rats and from tumour-bearers at different times after implantation. For this purpose, surviving target cells were quantified by incorporation of the y-emitting analogue of methionine, 75 Sel-methionine, in a <b>48</b> -h <b>assay</b> which detected both cytotoxic and cytostatic effects. The reactivity of TIL, which was consistently demonstrable from 11 days after tumour transplantation, was essentially similar to that of normal splenic lymphocytes in magnitude and specificity. Reciprocal cytotoxi-city tests using TIL and cultured targets from an antigenically unrelated tumour of similar aetiology (Mc 57) showed that the manifestation of TIL cytotoxicity was determined, not by the tumour of origin, but by the susceptibility of the target cells.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{collected}} data from over 80 different cytotoxicity assays from Pfizer in-house {{work as well}} as from public sources and investigated the feasibility of using these datasets, which come from a variety of assay formats (having for instance different measured endpoints, incubation times and cell types) to derive a general cytotoxicity model. Our main aim was to derive a computational model based on this data that can highlight potentially cytotoxic series early in the drug discovery process. Results We developed Bayesian models for each assay using Scitegic FCFP_ 6 fingerprints together with the default physical property descriptors. Pairs of assays that are mutually predictive were identified by calculating the ROC score of the model derived from one predicting the experimental outcome of the other, and vice versa. The prediction pairs were visualised in a network where nodes are assays and edges are drawn for ROC scores > 0. 60 in both directions. We observed that, if assay pairs (A, B) and (B, C) were mutually predictive, this was often not the case for the pair (A, C). The results from <b>48</b> <b>assays</b> connected to each other were merged in one training set of 145590 compounds and a general cytotoxicity model was derived. The model has been cross-validated as well as being validated with a set of 89 FDA approved drug compounds. Conclusions We have generated a predictive model for general cytotoxicity which could speed up the drug discovery process in multiple ways. Firstly, this analysis has shown that the outcomes of different assay formats can be mutually predictive, thus removing the need to submit a potentially toxic compound to multiple assays. Furthermore, this analysis enables selection of (a) the easiest-to-run assay as corporate standard, or (b) the most descriptive panel of assays by including assays whose outcomes are not mutually predictive. The model is no replacement for a cytotoxicity assay but opens the opportunity to be more selective about which compounds are to be submitted to it. On a more mundane level, having data from more than 80 assays in one dataset answers, for the first time, the question - "what are the known cytotoxic compounds from the Pfizer compound collection?" Finally, having a predictive cytotoxicity model will assist the design of new compounds with a desired cytotoxicity profile, since comparison of the model output with data from an in vitro safety/toxicology assay suggests one is predictive of the other. </p...|$|R

Microbiol. 33 : 1435 - 1441, 1995) {{was used for the}} direct detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in sputum. The assay was designed to target specific regions of 23 S rRNA found in M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum, and Mycobacterium microti and had a sensitivity ranging from approximately < 10 to 300 CFU. The assay was tested for cross-hybridization by using large numbers (e. g., 10 (5) to 10 (10) CFU/assay) of 133 other organisms commonly found in respiratory tract samples, including non-M. tuberculosis Mycobacterium spp., other bacteria, fungi, and viruses. All of these competitors tested negative by the assay. Automated assay results for 780 respiratory tract samples (sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens) collected and tested at three trial sites in the United States) were compared with the results of culture and acid-fast microscopy. Aliquots of conventionally digested and decontaminated sputum pellets were heated at 100 degrees C and mechanically disrupted prior to hybridization and background reduction, amplification, and detection in a closed disposable test pack. Pertinent elements of individual patient histories relating to tuberculosis exposure, previous active disease, antituberculosis therapy status, etc., were considered in the resolution of discrepant results for <b>48</b> (<b>assay</b> false-positive) samples. Seventy-one of 90 (78. 9 %) culture-positive samples were positive when tested in the Galileo assay, while 7 % of culture-negative samples were assay positive, corresponding to a sensitivity of 79 % and a specificity of 93 %. Following resolution of discrepant results by chart review, the sensitivity and specificity for the Q-Beta replicase amplification assay with the Galileo analyzer were 84 and 97 %, respectively.

40|$|Trichomonas vaginalis is a {{globally}} common {{sexually transmitted}} human parasite. Many strains of T. vaginalis {{from around the}} world have been described to be resistant to the current drug of choice, metronidazole. However, only a few cases of metronidazole resistance have been reported from Europe. The resistant strains cause prolonged infections which are difficult to treat. T. vaginalis infection also increases the risk for human immunodeficiency virus transmission. We present a practical method for determining the resistance of T. vaginalis to 5 -nitroimidazoles.

40|$|Mutant {{forms of}} the Plasmodium falciparum {{chloroquine}} resistance transporter (PfCRT) mediate chloro-quine resistance by effluxing the drug from the parasite’s digestive vacuole, the acidic organelle in which chloroquine exerts its parasiticidal effect. However, different parasites bearing the same mutant form of PfCRT can vary substantially in their chloroquine susceptibility. Here, we have investigated the biochemical basis for the difference in chloroquine response among transfectant parasite lines having different genetic backgrounds but bearing the same mutant form of PfCRT. Despite showing significant differences in their chloroquine susceptibility, all lines with the mutant PfCRT showed a similar chloroquine-induced H leak from the digestive vacuole, indicative of similar rates of PfCRT-mediated chloroquine efflux. Furthermore, all lines showed similarly reduced levels of drug accumulation. Factors other than chloroquine efflux and accumulation therefore influence the susceptibility to this drug in parasites expressing mutant PfCRT. Furthermore, in some but not all strains bearing mutant PfCRT, the 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) for chloroquine {{and the degree of}} resistance compared to that of recombinant control parasites varied with the length of the parasite growth assays. In these parasites, the 50 % inhibitory concentration for chloroquine measured in 72 - or 96 -h assays was significantly lower than that measured in <b>48</b> -h <b>assays.</b> This highlights the importance of considering the first- and second-cycle activities of chloroquine in future studies of parasite susceptibility to this drug...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} the analytical and clinical performances {{of a new}} radial partition immunoassay for measunng the mass concentration of creatine kinase (CK) -MB in serum. All pipetting, washes, incubations and data reduction were per-formed in 8 mm by the Stratus#{ 174 }(Dade) fluorometric analyzer. Within-assay and between-assay CVs were respectively 5. 5 % and 8. 4 % at 21 /L, and 4. 2 % and 3. 4 % at <b>48</b> /. Lg/L. <b>Assaying</b> serial dilutions of serum samples with high CK-MB concentrations demonstrated excellent linearity. Results of the Stratus technique correlated well (n = 115, r = 0. 98) {{with those of the}} Tandem-E CKMB II assay. There was no interference from hemolysis, bilirubin, rheumatoid factor, or added CK-MM (up to 3500 U/L); consequently,CK-MB can be determined in undiluted serum, even in the presence of high total CK activity.

40|$|Class D β-lactamases with {{carbapenemase}} {{activity are}} emerging as carbapenem-resistance determinants in gram-negative bacterial pathogens, mostly Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Carbapenemase activity {{is an unusual}} feature among class D β-lactamases, and the structural elements responsible for this activity remain unclear. Based on structural and molecular dynamics data, we previously hypothesized a potential role of the residues located in the short-loop connecting strands β 5 and β 6 (the β 5 -β 6 loop) in conferring the carbapenemase activity of the OXA- 48 enzyme. In this work, the narrow-spectrum OXA- 10 class D β-lactamase, which is unable to hydrolyze carbapenems, {{was used as a}} model to investigate the possibility of evolving carbapenemase activity by replacement of the β 5 -β 6 loop with those present in three different lineages of class D carbapenemases (OXA- 23, OXA- 24, and OXA- <b>48).</b> Biological <b>assays</b> and kinetic measurements showed that all three OXA- 10 -derived hybrids acquired significant carbapenemase activity. Structural analysis of the OXA- 10 loop 24 and OXA- 10 loop 48 hybrids revealed no significant changes in the molecular fold of the enzyme, except for the orientation of the substituted β 5 -β 6 loops, which was reminiscent of that found in their parental enzymes. These results demonstrate the crucial role of the β 5 -β 6 loop in the carbapenemase activity of class D β-lactamases, and provide previously unexplored insights into the mechanism by which these enzymes can evolve carbapenemase activity...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the usefulness of}} a fast (48 -h) limiting dilution assay (LDA) for the enumeration of human alloreactive helper T lymphocytes (HTL) in the peripheral blood, in relation to histologically defined rejection grades after heart transplantation. HTL frequencies (HTLf) in pretransplant samples varied from patient to patient, ranging from 106 to 625 HTL/ 106 {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC). In the first week after heart transplantation (HTx), when immunosuppression was instituted, HTLf were significant lower (range 30 – 190 HTL/ 106). The level of HTL in the first week after HTx when rejection grade was 0 or 1 A (ISHLT score) was considered to be the baseline frequency. This frequency did not correlate with the number of subsequent rejection episodes. During rejection (grade 3), donor-specific HTLf were increased above their baseline frequencies (P = 0. 01). Expressed as percentage of baseline frequencies, HTLf increased significantly during acute rejection (AR) compared with 1 – 2 weeks before rejection (P = 0. 003). The increase was specific, since viral infections did not result in a rise of donor-specific HTL, while also HTLf specific for third party HLA antigens were not elevated during rejection. Monitoring HTLf in peripheral blood with a shortened (<b>48</b> -h) <b>assay</b> may serve as a non-invasive method for detecting intragraft immunological reactivity. Demonstrating absence of donor-specific reactivity may limit the number of invasive endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) procedures and allow tapering of immunosuppressive treatment...|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the last}} decade many {{laboratories}} have shown that mRNA levels in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FPE) tissue specimens can be quantified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques despite the extensive RNA fragmentation that occurs in tissues so preserved. We have developed RT-PCR methods that are sensitive, precise, and that have multianalyte capability for potential wide use in clinical research and diagnostic assays. Here it is shown that the extent of fragmentation of extracted FPE tissue RNA significantly increases with archive storage time. Probe and primer sets for RT-PCR assays based on amplicons that are both short and homogeneous in length enable effective reference gene-based data normalization for cross comparison of specimens that differ substantially in age. A <b>48</b> -gene <b>assay</b> used to compare gene expression profiles from the same breast cancer tissue that had been either frozen or FPE showed very similar profiles after reference gene-based normalization. A 92 -gene assay, using RNA extracted from three 10 -μm FPE sections of archival breast cancer specimens (dating from 1985 to 2001) yielded analyzable data for these genes in all 62 tested specimens. The results were substantially concordant when estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER 2 receptor status determined by RT-PCR was compared with immunohistochemistry assays for these receptors. Furthermore, the results highlight the advantages of RT-PCR over immunohistochemistry with respect to quantitation and dynamic range. These findings support the development of RT-PCR analysis of FPE tissue RNA as a platform for multianalyte clinical diagnostic tests...|$|R
40|$|Several {{members of}} the phenylamino- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone series were {{prepared}} in order to investigate structure-activity relationships (SAR) and to explore the antitumor effects associated with this scaffold. The cytotoxic effects of the aminoquinones (EC 50) against a panel of cancer cell lines (MCF 7, DU 145 and T 24 cells) and healthy fibroblasts (BALB/ 3 T 3) were assessed in vitro using the MTT reduction <b>assay</b> <b>48</b> h after drug exposure. SAR analysis of the aminonaphthoquinone series showed that insertion of a chlorine atom in the acceptor quinone nucleus and/or insertion of a methyl group at the nitrogen atom of the donor phenylamino group induced significant changes in cytotoxic activity. Quinones 7 and 9, which exhibited the highest selective indexes (5. 73 and 6. 29, respectively), were further characterized using the following assays: Colony formation, caspase- 3 activity, and ATP content. The results showed that aminoquinone 7 strongly influenced ATP levels and impaired the proliferative capacity of T 24 cells without activating caspase- 3. status: publishe...|$|R

MethodsThe effect of bortezomib on the viability of HeLa cell was measured by MTT assay. The effect of bortezomib on cell migration and invasion was measured by Transwell assay and invasion experiment respectively. The activation of Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and expression level of MMP 2, MMP 9 were assayed by western blot. ResultsMTT assay indicated bortezomib (2. 5  μM, 5  μM, 10  μM) could inhibit HeLa cell viability, and the inhibitory rate was highest at <b>48</b>  h. Transwell <b>assay</b> and invasion experiment results showed that bortezomib inhibited HeLa cell migration and invasion. Western blotting assays presented bortezomib could suppress the phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR, and down-regulate the expression of MMP 2 and MMP 9. ConclusionsThese results suggested bortezomib could inhibit migration and invasion in cervical carcinoma HeLa cell, which {{might be related to}} Akt/mTOR signal pathway...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{cellular}} {{basis of}} the augmentation of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) by systemically administered BCG was investigated in C 57 Bl/ 6 mice. BCG pretreatment potentiated the CMI to alloantigens as measured by a <b>48</b> -hour microcytotoxicity <b>assay</b> (MCA) against P 815 Y tumor cells. The effector cell was not a T-cell, as demonstrated by its lack of sensitivity to antithymocyte serum and complement and its failure to kill in a short-term 5 'Cr release assay. The effector cell also was not a classical macrophage, {{because it was not}} depleted by treatment with silica. CMI as measured by the MCA was consistently depleted by magnetic separation after incubation with carbonyl iron. The active cell(s) showed variable adherence properties. The augmen-tation of alloimmunity was alloantigen-specific. The specificity ap-peared to be due to the interaction between effector cells without inherent specificity and sensitized T-cells. -JNCI· 1982; 69 : 613 - 618.
