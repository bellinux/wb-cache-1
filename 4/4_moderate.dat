40|$|A three-stage context {{amplification}} {{model was}} tested {{with a sample}} of 345 African-American parent–child dyads. The model combined the conceptual structure of stress generation with recent findings regarding genetic susceptibility. Because the 7 R + allele of the dopamine transporter (DRD 4) has the potential to enhance contextual priming and arousal, this allele was examined as a potential moderator of each stage of the amplification process. Particular attention was given to the hypothesized influence of parental negative arousal on valence of parent–child interactions. The literature on genetic susceptibility led to the hypothesis that DRD <b>4</b> would <b>moderate</b> each stage of the model in a “for better or for worse” manner. The model was partially supported. DRD <b>4</b> <b>moderated</b> effects at all three stages of the model and, as hypothesized, DRD <b>4</b> <b>moderated</b> contextual effects on negative arousal in a “for better or for worse” manner. Effects on parent–child interaction, however, were moderated in a “for worse” manner only. These results indicate that parenting interactions may amplify the effects of positive and negative contexts in a stress-generating manner, and that a susceptibility framework captures the way in which DRD <b>4</b> <b>moderates</b> the impact of context on negative arousal...|$|R

We are interested in a related question: do expert rankings of real-world entities correlate with search engine rankings of corresponding web resources? For example, each year US News & World Report publishes a list of (among others) top 50 graduate business schools. Does their expert ranking correlate with the search engine ranking of the URLs of those business schools? To answer this question we conducted 9 experiments using 8 expert rankings on a range of academic, athletic, financial and popular culture topics.

However, these categories are not distinctly defined, {{and are often}} used arbitrarily. Instruments for pain assessment use more sophisticated scales, such as a 0 – 10 numerical rating scale, and apart from pain intensity assess pain-related interference and disability. The aim {{of the study was}} to identify cutoff points for mild, moderate, and severe nondental orofacial pain using a numerical rating scale, a pain-related interference scale, and a disability measurement. Materials and methods: A total of 245 patients referred to the Facial Pain Unit in London were included in the study. Intensity and pain-related interference were assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory. Pain-related disability was assessed by the Chronic Graded Pain Scale. Average pain intensity (0 – 10) was classified into nine schemes with varying cutoff points of mild, moderate, and severe pain. The scheme with the most significant intergroup difference, expressed by multivariate analysis of variance, provided the cutoffs between mild, moderate, and severe pain. Results: The combination that showed the greatest intergroup differences for all patients was scheme 47 (mild 1 – <b>4,</b> <b>moderate</b> 5 – 7, severe 8 – 10). The same combination provided the greatest intergroup differences in subgroups of patients with temporomandibular disorder and chronic idiopathic facial pain, respectively. Among the trigeminal neuralgia patients alone, the combination with the highest intergroup differences was scheme 48 (mild 1 – <b>4,</b> <b>moderate</b> 5 – 8, severe 9 – 10). Conclusion: The cutoff points established in this study can discriminate in pain intensity categories reasonably well, and showed a significant difference in most of the outcome measures used.

40|$|AbstractThe major {{purpose of}} this article is to expand the domain of the {{business}} research by providing conceptual analysis of the moderating and mediating variables and exploring their potent effects in business research. To provide specific implications, Kang et al. (2015) model with respect to Balanced Scorecard technique is conceptually extended. Theoretical foundation of the moderating, mediating, and their major distinctions along with appropriate statistical tests applicable to each situation are also provided. The model is also extended to analyzing interaction effects of Mediated-Moderation and Moderated-Mediation designs and their testing. The article concludes that: 1) the nature of complex business problems will be more transparently captured by considering moderating and mediating variables, 2) without specifying moderating and mediating variables, business models are incomplete and therefore are not able to solve real business obstacles. Lack of inclusion of moderating and mediating effects is one viable reason which indicates why most business models do not function in real practice, 3) moderating and mediating variables are widening the scope of the prevalent business theories, and <b>4)</b> <b>moderating</b> and moderating variables makes it possible to respond to the inquiries regarding “when” “how” and “why” a particular relationship exists between the independent and dependent variables.

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on November 15, 2013). Variation in the gene {{encoding}} the dopamine D 4 receptor (DRD <b>4)</b> may <b>moderate</b> {{the influence of}} environments (i. e., a gene-environment interaction, GXE) on personality traits and motives associated with alcohol use disorders. This project examines whether variation in DRD <b>4</b> <b>moderates</b> the environmental influence of childhood adversity on personality (including replication attempts of reported GXE) as well as coping motives. Primary analyses were conducted in the Alcohol, Health, and Behavior (AHB; for current analyses ns= 236 - 252) dataset, a prospective, high-risk sample of college students who were assessed seven times from ages 18 - 35. Replication analyses were conducted in the Missouri Adolescent Female Twin Study (MOAFTS, for current analyses ns = 1, 017 - 1476), a study of a birth cohort of female like-sex twin pairs. Analyses involving DRD 4 2 - and 5 - repeat allele carries vs. others yielded findings inconsistent with the existing GXE personality studies. Although results varied, 7 -repeat carriers appeared to be more susceptible to environmental influences on novelty seeking, {{and to a lesser}} extent impulsivity, in the AHB data; this finding largely failed to replicate in MOAFTS. No GXE on coping motives were identified. These findings provide limited support that DRD 4 status modifies the influence of childhood adversity on personality and have implications for replication-focused research involving GXE...|$|R
