The ballast in such systems can equally be a resistor. A number of fluorescent lamp fittings used a filament lamp as the ballast in the late 1950s through to the 1960s.

50|$|The Polish WT-4 plug {{is adopted}} in Russia as ШТР-IV and has four metal pins and an {{additional}} fourth dielectric pin. The corresponding socket comes in two variants. The GTN-4 socket (РТШ-IV in Russia) provides a <b>4</b> <b>pin</b> connection (in most cases, the two rightmost pins are used for connecting a single line). The GTNC-4 (РТШК-IV) is a GTN-4 socket that has an additional circuit. The 5th plastic pin of the inserted plug disconnects a 1μF capacitor that otherwise closes the circuit of the telephone line when the plug is not inserted. This feature allows testing the line when the phone is not plugged in. The usage of a capacitor is mostly obsolete and GTN-4 sockets produced later reuse the capacitor compartment for an additional RJ11 socket.|$|E

40|$|PIN-FORMED (PIN) {{proteins}} are plant-specific secondary transporters {{acting in}} the efflux of plant signaling molecule auxin from cells. Their asymmetrical localization within cells determines the directionality of auxin flow and thereby influences plant development.

Therefore the main focus of this diploma thesis is the characterization of the transcriptional regulation of PIN proteins, namely <b>PIN</b> <b>4</b> protein. The observation of plants carrying transcriptional fusion consisting of various lengths of <b>PIN</b> <b>4</b> promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) showed which part of <b>PIN</b> <b>4</b> promoter is essential for binding transcription factors and for the start of transcription.
