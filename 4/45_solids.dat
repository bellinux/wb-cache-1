40|$|Abstract: Different {{techniques}} {{used to produce}} semi-solid alloys can result in different structures in the material and, therefore, in distinct rheological behaviours which determine its thixo-forming ability. Suitable raw materials {{to be used for}} SSM forming must present non-dendritic, very fine or fragmented structure in order to globularize without excessive agglomeration when re-heated to the semi-solid state. This work analyses the influence of raw material production route on the rheological behaviour of semi-solid A 356 alloy. Techniques used were: electromagnetic stirring (EMS) and chemical ultra-refining (UR). Samples were re-heated to 580 o C (~ 0. <b>45</b> <b>solid</b> fraction) and hold for 0, 90 and 210 s to allow the observation of the structure evolution. After structures characterization, the samples were submitted to compression tests, at δH/δt = 10 mm/s, in the same temperature/holding time conditions. Viscosity of the differently prepared raw material was related to the grain size, primary particle size, geometrical factor (roundness shape factor and contiguity) ...|$|R

40|$|Forest biomass {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{contributors}} to the EU’s renewable energy target of 20 % gross final energy consumption in 2020 (Renewable Energy Directive). Following the RED, new sustainability principles are launched by the European energy sector, such as the Initiative Wood Pellet Buyers (IWPB). The aim of our study is the investigation of the quantitative impacts from IWPB’s principles for forest biomass for energy only. We deploy a bottom up method that quantifies the supplies and the costs from log harvest until forest chip delivery at a domestic consumer. We have a reference situation with existing national (forest) legislation and voluntary certification schemes (scenario 1) and a future situation with additional criteria based on the IWPB principles (scenario 2). Two country studies were selected for our (2008) survey: one in Finland with nearly 100 % certification and one in Leningrad province with a minor areal share of certification in scenario 1. The sustainable potential of forest resources for energy is about 54 Mm 3 (385 PJ) in Finland and about 13. 5 Mm 3 (95 PJ) in Leningrad in scenario 1 without extra criteria. The potential volumes reduce considerably by maximum 43 % respectively 39 % after new criteria from the IWPB, like a minimum use of sawlogs, stumps and slash for energy, and by an increased area of protected forests (scenario 2 A Maximum extra restrictions). In case sawlogs can be used, but instead ash recycling is applied after a maximum stump and slash recovery (scenario 2 B Minimum extra restrictions), the potential supply is less reduced: 5 % in Finland and 22 % in Leningrad region. The estimated reference costs for forest chips are between € 18 and € <b>45</b> <b>solid</b> m- 3 in Finland and between € 7 and € 33 solid m- 3 in the Leningrad region. In scenario 2 a, the costs will mainly increase by € 7 m- 3 for delimbing full trees (Finland), and maximum € 0. 3 m- 3 for suggested improved forest management (Leningrad region).

The recent developments {{in the field of}} intermetallic scandium compounds are reviewed. The structural topics concern defect formation, structural disorder, superstructure formation, as well as the detection of multiple scandium sites. To address questions of this kind, high-resolution 45 Sc NMR techniques have been established as a new structural tool for the quantification of the local coordination scan-dium environments and the detailed characterization of their internal NMR interaction parameters. Owing to the moderately sized nuclear electric quadrupole moment of 45 Sc, the magic-angle spinning spectra are affected both by first- and second-order quadrupo-lar perturbations, which can be analyzed and quantified by fast magic angle spinning, assisted by lineshape simulations. The resolution can be further improved by correlating triple quantum (TQ) with single quantum coherences.

Native egg yolk containing <b>45</b> wt% <b>solids</b> was used for all the samples. Thermally set EY/ k C gels were also studied by SAOS and texture analysis.

This last effect seems to be domi- nant as pH shifts towards the isoelectric point (IEP) of egg yolk proteins, whereas, at pH far from the IEP a certain enhancement in the degree of compatibility, and even some k C autohydrolysis, seems to take place. The results obtained either from rheological or textural characterization of gels were consistent with that balance.

We evaluated, retro-spectively, the outcome and survival of 81 patients who were treated with voricon-azole for definite (n 48) or probable (n 33) CNS aspergillosis. Complete and partial responses were recorded in 35 % of patients and varied by the underlying disease group: hematologic malignancies (54 %), other underlying conditions (50 %), chronic immunosuppression (<b>45</b> %), <b>solid</b> organ transplantation (36 %), and hemato-poietic stem cell transplantation (16 %). Thirty-one percent of patients survived CNS aspergillosis for a median observa-tion time of 390 days.

Both structures were refined from single crystal X-ray diffractometer data: YAlGe type, Cmcm, a = 429. 53 (8), b = 907. 7 (1), c = 527. 86 (1) pm, wR 2 = 0. 0375, 231 F 2 values, for ScPdZn and a = 425. 3 (1), b = 918. 4 (2), c = 523. 3 (1) pm, wR 2 = 0. 0399, 213 F 2 values for ScPtZn with 14 variables per refinement. The structures are orthorhombically distorted variants of the AlB 2 type. The scandium and palladium (platinum atoms) build up ordered networks Sc 3 Pd 3 and Sc 3 Pt 3 (boron networks) which are slightly shifted with respect to each other. These networks are penetrated by chains of zinc atoms (262 pm in ScPtZn) which correspond to the aluminum positions, i. e. Zn(ScPd) and Zn(ScPt). The corresponding group-subgroup scheme and the differences in chemical bonding with respect to other AlB 2 -derived REPdZn and REPtZn compounds are discussed. <b>45</b> Sc <b>solid</b> state NMR spectra confirm the single crystallographic scandium sites. From electronic band structure calculations the two compounds are found metallic with free electron like behavior at the Fermi level. A larger cohesive energy for ScPtZn suggests a more strongly bonded intermetallic than ScPdZn. Electron localization and overlap population analyses identify the largest bonding for scandium with the transition metal (Pd, Pt) ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that maximum {{growth rates of}} up to 80 % of the theoretical limit can be attained in Czochralski-grown silicon crystals while maintaining single crystal structure. Attaining the other 20 % increase is dependent on design changes in the grower, to reduce the temperature gradient in the liquid while increasing the gradient in the solid. The conclusions of Hopkins et al. (1977) {{on the effect of}} diameter on the breakdown of structure at fast growth rates are substantiated. Copper was utilized as the test impurity. At large diameters (greater than 7. 5 cm), concentrations of greater than 1 ppm copper were attained in the <b>solid</b> (<b>45,</b> 000 ppm in the liquid) without breakdown at maximum growth speeds. For smaller diameter crystals, the sensitivity of impurities is much more apparent. For solar cell applications, impurities will limit cell performance before they cause crystal breakdown for fast growth rates of large diameter crystals...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the preparation of}} aqueous emulsions consisting of soy proteins and chemically modified thermosetting aliphatic polyketones. Emulsions were prepared {{in a range of}} total solids contents and different addition protocols were tested. Room temperature stability and structure of the prepared emulsions were studied as a function of time using dynamic light scattering, rheology, cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM) and confocal fluorescence microscopy. Emulsions at 40 - <b>45</b> wt% total <b>solids</b> content with an average particle size less than 1 mu m, and a viscosity less than 1 Pa s could be prepared and were shown to be stable for more than 6 months. Emulsions with protein contents up to 40 wt% with respect to the unmodified polyketone fulfill wood adhesive requirements according to the European Standard EN- 314. Confocal fluorescence pictures clearly demonstrate a better penetration of the protein/polyketone adhesive into the wood surface as compared to the one of the adhesive based on polyketones only.

40|$|S-CKD 602 is a PEGylated {{liposomal}} {{formulation of}} CKD- 602, a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor. The {{objective of this}} study was to characterize the bidirectional pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) interaction between S-CKD 602 and monocytes. Plasma concentrations of encapsulated CKD- 602 and monocytes counts from <b>45</b> patients with <b>solid</b> tumors were collected following intravenous administration of S-CKD 602 in the phase I study. The PK-PD models were developed and fit simultaneously to the PK-PD data, using NONMEM®. The monocytopenia after administration of S-CKD 602 was described by direct toxicity to monocytes in a mechanism-based model, and by direct toxicity to progenitor cells in bone marrow in a myelosuppression-based model. The nonlinear PK disposition of S-CKD 602 was described by linear degradation and irreversible binding to monocytes in the mechanism-based model, and Michaelis-Menten kinetics in the myelosuppression-based model. The mechanism-based PK-PD model characterized the nonlinear PK disposition, and the bidirectional PK-PD interaction between S-CKD 602 and monocytes. © 2012 Cárdenas et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd...|$|R
