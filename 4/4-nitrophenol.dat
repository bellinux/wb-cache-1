2500|$|Phenol {{is highly}} {{reactive}} toward electrophilic aromatic substitution as the oxygen atom's pi electrons donate electron density into the ring. [...] By this general approach, many groups can be appended to the ring, via halogenation, acylation, sulfonation, and other processes. However, phenol's ring is so strongly activated—second only to aniline—that bromination or chlorination of phenol leads to substitution on all carbon atoms ortho and para to the hydroxy group, {{not only on}} one carbon. Phenol reacts with dilute nitric acid at room temperature to give a mixture of 2-nitrophenol and <b>4-nitrophenol</b> while with concentrated nitric acid, more nitro groups get substituted on the ring to give 2,4,6-trinitrophenol which is known as picric acid.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>4-Nitrophenol</b> shows two polymorphs in the {{crystalline}} state. The alpha-form is colorless pillars, unstable at room temperature, {{and stable}} toward sunlight.

50|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of enzyme activity {{requires that the}} <b>4-nitrophenol</b> product is fully deprotonated, existing as 4-nitrophenolate, given the weak absorbance of <b>4-nitrophenol</b> at 405 nm. Complete ionization of the alcohol functional group affects the conjugation of the pi bonds on the compound. A lone pair from the oxygen can be delocalized via conjugation to the benzene ring and nitro group. Since the length of conjugated systems affects the color of organic compounds, this ionization change causes the <b>4-nitrophenol</b> to turn yellow when fully deprotonated and existing as 4-nitrophenolate.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>4-Nitrophenol</b> {{can be used}} as a pH indicator. A {{solution}} of <b>4-nitrophenol</b> appears colorless below pH 5.4 and yellow above pH 7.5. This color-changing property makes this compound useful as a pH indicator. The yellow color of the 4-nitrophenolate form (or 4-nitrophenoxide) is due to a maximum of absorbance at 405 nm (ε = 18.3 to 18.4 mM−1 cm−1 in strong alkali). In contrast, <b>4-nitrophenol</b> has a weak absorbance at 405 nm (ε = 0.2 mM−1 cm−1).The isosbestic point for 4-nitrophenol/4-nitrophenoxide is at 348 nm, with ε = 5.4 mM−1 cm−1.|$|E

5000|$|... 4-Nitrochlorobenzene is an {{intermediate}} {{in the preparation}} of a variety of derivatives. Nitration gives 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, and 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene. Reduction with iron metal gives 4-chloroaniline. The electron-withdrawing nature of the appended nitro-group makes the benzene ring especially susceptible to nucleophilic aromatic substitution, unlike related chlorobenzene. Thus, the strong nucleophiles hydroxide, methoxide, and amide displace chloride to give respectively <b>4-nitrophenol,</b> 4-nitroanisole, 4-nitroaniline.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of oxidoreductases, {{specifically}} those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen.

The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-nitrophenol,NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase (2-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include <b>4-nitrophenol</b> hydroxylase, and 4-nitrophenol-2-hydroxylase. This enzyme participates in gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation.

50|$|The {{original}} {{method for}} production involves the nitration of phenol with sodium nitrate gives {{a mixture of}} two isomers, from which the wanted <b>4-nitrophenol</b> (bp 279 °C) can easily be separated by steam distillation. In this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, phenol's oxygen is strongly activating, thus the reaction requires only mild conditions as compared to nitration of benzene itself. The nitro group is then reduced to an amine, giving 4-aminophenol. Finally, the amine is acetylated with acetic anhydride. Industrially direct hydrogenation is used, but in the laboratory scale sodium borohydride serves.|$|E
