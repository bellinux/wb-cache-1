50|$|The limit {{switches}} signal when an end {{position has been}} reached. The torque switching measures the torque present in the valve. When exceeding a set limit, this is signaled in the same way. Actuators are often equipped with a remote position transmitter which indicates the valve position as continuous <b>4-20mA</b> <b>current</b> or voltage signal.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pneumatic}} control signals are traditionally {{based on a}} pressure range of 3-15psi (0.2-1.0 bar), or more commonly now, an electrical signal of 4-20mA for industry, or 0-10V for HVAC systems. Electrical control now often includes a [...] "Smart" [...] communication signal superimposed on the <b>4-20mA</b> control <b>current,</b> such that the health and verification of the valve position can be signalled back to the controller. The HART, Fieldbus Foundation, and Profibus {{are the most common}} protocols.|$|R
50|$|The string {{potentiometer}} may {{be connected}} as a three-wire tapped resistor (voltage divider), in a control circuit, {{or may be}} packaged with electronics to produce a measurement signal in a useful form, such as a variable voltage 0-10 VDC, variable <b>current</b> <b>4-20mA,</b> pulse encoder, Bus (DeviceNet and Canbus) and RS232 communications.|$|R
