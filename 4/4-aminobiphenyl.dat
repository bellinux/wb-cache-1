50|$|In 2004 a known human carcinogen, <b>4-aminobiphenyl</b> or 4-ABP, {{was found}} in some {{commercial}} hair dyes. However, evidence is limited and inconsistent for the link between cancer from hair dye.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>4-Aminobiphenyl</b> is an amine {{derivative}} of biphenyl. It {{is used to}} manufacture azo dyes. It is a known human carcinogen and so it has been largely replaced by less toxic compounds.|$|E
50|$|UDP-glucuronic acid (glucuronic acid linked via a {{glycosidic bond}} to uridine diphosphate) is an {{intermediate}} {{in the process}} and is formed in the liver. One example is the N-glucuronidation of an aromatic amine, <b>4-aminobiphenyl,</b> by UGT1A4 or UGT1A9 from human, rat, or mouse liver.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of transferases, {{specifically}} those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:arylamine N-acetyltransferase. Other names in common use include arylamine acetylase, beta-naphthylamine N-acetyltransferase, <b>4-aminobiphenyl</b> N-acetyltransferase, acetyl CoA-arylamine N-acetyltransferase, 2-naphthylamine N-acetyltransferase, arylamine acetyltransferase, indoleamine N-acetyltransferase, N-acetyltransferase, p-aminosalicylate N-acetyltransferase, serotonin acetyltransferase, and serotonin N-acetyltransferase.|$|E
50|$|Factors such as age, {{gender and}} {{different}} occupations put a {{person at risk}} for bladder cancer - smoking is the only other known risk. <b>4-aminobiphenyl</b> (4-ABP) is an integral component in tobacco smoke, {{as well as a}} risk factor for bladder cancer. Sidestream smoke puts individuals at an increased risk of bladder cancer because the 4-ABP concentrations are over ten times that of mainstream smoke.|$|E
50|$|Tobacco smoke {{contains}} {{a number of}} toxicologically significant chemicals and groups of chemicals, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzopyrene), tobacco-specific nitrosamines (NNK, NNN), aldehydes (acrolein, formaldehyde), carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, nitrogen oxides, benzene, toluene, phenols (phenol, cresol), and aromatic amines (nicotine, ABP (<b>4-Aminobiphenyl)).</b> The radioactive element polonium-210 is also known to occur in tobacco smoke. The chemical composition of smoke depends on puff frequency, intensity, volume, and duration {{at different stages of}} cigarette consumption.|$|E
5000|$|A 2004 {{study by}} the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization {{concluded}} that non-smokers {{are exposed to the}} same carcinogens as active smokers. Sidestream smoke contains more than 4,000 chemicals, including 69 known carcinogens. Of special concern are polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines, and aromatic amines, such as <b>4-aminobiphenyl,</b> all known to be highly carcinogenic. Mainstream smoke, sidestream smoke, and second-hand smoke contain largely the same components, however the concentration varies depending on type of smoke. [...] Several well-established carcinogens have been shown by the tobacco companies' own research to be present at higher concentrations in sidestream smoke than in mainstream smoke.|$|E
50|$|Sidestream {{tobacco smoke}} {{is made up}} of many components, {{including}} carbon monoxide, tar, nicotine, ammonia, benzene, cadmium and <b>4-aminobiphenyl.</b> Some of the other compounds found in sidestream smoke are: vinylchloride, hydrogen cyanide, arsenic, acrolein, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, catechol, cresol, hydroquinone, lead, methyl ethyl ketone, nitric oxide, phenol, styrene, toluene, and butane. Exposure to sidestream smoke yields higher concentrations of these compounds as well as increased concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin, nicotine, and cotinine in the blood. When comparing sidestream and mainstream condensate, side stream has 2-6 times more condensate per gram than mainstream smoke. Due to the incomplete combustion process responsible for the creation of sidestream smoke, there may be exposure to higher concentrations of carcinogens than are typically inhaled directly.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{study of}} {{diphenylamine}} metabolism in harvested and dipped apples at different time intervals {{it was observed that}} radiolabelled residues of diphenylamine penetrate from the surface into the pulp, which after 40 weeks contained 32% of the residue. Diphenylamine was always the major residue, but 3 metabolites were found in good amounts in the apple samples, whose identification experts considered insufficient.(Kim-Kang, H. 1993. Metabolism of 14C-diphenylamine in stored apples—nature of the residue in plants. Report RPT00124. Study XBL 91071. XenoBiotic Laboratories, Inc., USA, unpublished) cited in [...] There is a data gap on presence or formation of nitrosamines in apple metabolism or during processing. The carcinogen <b>4-Aminobiphenyl</b> can accompany diphenylamine as an impurity.|$|E
