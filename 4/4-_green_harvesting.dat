50|$|Bordeaux {{has seen}} {{a rise in the}} use of <b>green</b> <b>harvesting,</b> where unripe bunches are cut off in the summer in order to channel more of the plant's {{strength}} to the remaining bunches. While it is a popular process, it also has its opponents, such as Jean Gautreau of Château Sociando-Mallet, Gonzague Lurton of Château Durfort-Vivens and Olivier Bernard of Domaine de Chevalier, who claim that the remaining berries simply grow bigger, not better. <b>Green</b> <b>harvesting</b> requires cheap labor, often ignorant of properly cutting vines. Opponents point to vintages 1929 and 1947, which were high-yield and of great quality—and made entirely without <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> techniques.|$|R
50|$|A <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> is {{the removal}} of {{immature}} grape bunches, typically {{for the purpose of}} decreasing yield. The removal of the bunches while they are still green induces the vine to put all its energy into developing the remaining grapes. In theory this results in better ripening and the development of more numerous and mature flavour compounds. In the absence of a <b>green</b> <b>harvest,</b> a healthy, vigorous vine can produce dilute, unripe grapes.|$|R

5000|$|When {{results from}} {{empirical}} research put the sugarcane industry, and {{companies such as}} HC&S, in an undesirable light, the counter argument most often presented is that pre-harvest burning is the most cost effective method of harvesting stalks. HC&S administrators insist that the burnt harvest method is “critical to the company’s bottom line” {{and it would be}} economically inefficient to do otherwise. However, harvesting sugarcane without burning the stalks, or <b>green</b> <b>harvesting,</b> {{has been found to be}} just as economically efficient as burnt cane harvesting in a multi-regional study performed by agricultural researchers at the University of Florida. Sugarcane plantations in Texas, Louisiana, and Puerto Rico have proven that <b>green</b> <b>harvesting</b> can be done without jeopardizing the company’s profits, making it a win-win situation for both the company and the surrounding community. <b>Green</b> <b>harvesting</b> on Maui would require HC&S to upgrade their plowing machinery and harvesting equipment, but after this initial expense, profits would not necessarily be negatively affected.|$|R

40|$|In Sicily in the 2010 - 2012 period <b>green</b> <b>harvesting</b> is {{the most}} {{successful}} of the 9 measures provided by the Italian National Support Programme (NSP) for wine. Its main goal is to contribute to restoring the balance between supply and demand by destructing or removing grape bunches in their immature stage {{in order to prevent}} market crises. The paper firstly presents the main results of a "three-year" application of <b>Green</b> <b>Harvesting</b> measure to the Sicilian wine sector. Firstly the implementation of <b>Green</b> <b>Harvesting</b> Measure was examined at EU, national and regional level through the analysis of the available statistical data; at a later stage its effects on the Sicilian wine sector were investigated. The trend of vineyard area and wine production was studied by comparing them before and throughout the application of <b>Green</b> <b>Harvesting.</b> Another stage of the research consisted of a survey carried out through direct interviews to 30 Sicilian wine cooperatives, the aim of which was to collect and analyse the trend of grape quantities delivered to the cooperatives, as well as the correspondent prices concerning the last 6 grape harvests (2007 - 2012). Another aim of the research was to collect the most common viewpoints and impressions of people working in the wine sector cooperatives with regards to the above-mentioned measure. The study has pointed out that "Green Harvesting" has been contributing - together with other elements - to reduce the supply of wine grape in Sicily and partially to raise the prices of the wines involved in this region. This measure has been however object of criticisms in relation to its impact in economic, social and ethical terms...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{sugarcane}} <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> system, {{characterized by}} mechanized harvesting {{and the absence}} of crop burning, affects soil quality by increasing crop residue on the soil surface after harvest; thus, it contributes to improving the physical, chemical, and microbiological properties and influences the soil carbon content and CO 2 flux (FCO 2). This study aimed to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of soil FCO 2 in sugarcane <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> systems. The experiment was conducted in two areas of sugarcane in São Paulo, Brazil: the first had a 5 -year history of sugarcane <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> (SG- 5) and the second had a longer history of 10 years (SG- 10). The temporal FCO 2 were evaluated in the dry and rainy periods, and spatial variability in the dry period, and related to soil chemical and physical properties, including organic C porosity, bulk density, soil penetration resistance, mean weight diameter of soil aggregates, clay, P, S, Ca, Mg and Fe. The temporal variability indicated no differences between the dry and rainy periods in SG- 10, while in SG- 5 soil moisture was increased by 33 % in the rainy period. The spatial variability indicated a different pattern from the temporal one, where FCO 2 in SG- 10 was correlated with soil temperature, air-filled pore space, total porosity, soil moisture, and the Ca and Mg contents; in the SG- 5 area, FCO 2 was correlated with soil mean weight diameter of soil aggregates and the sulfur content...|$|R

50|$|Baratuciat is a mid-ripening grape {{variety that}} can be very {{vigorous}} and prone to producing a large canopy and high yields if not kept in check by winter pruning, <b>green</b> <b>harvesting</b> and canopy management techniques throughout the growing season.

50|$|Grand Noir de la Calmette {{is a high}} {{yielding}} grape {{variety that}} needs to be kept in check by winter pruning or <b>green</b> <b>harvesting.</b> It can be limited by plantings in vineyard soils of low fertility, however, vines planted in those types of soils do run the risk of shriveling. Among the viticultural hazards that Grand Noir de la Calmette is most susceptible to is powdery mildew.|$|R
50|$|Pruning {{of vines}} {{should take place}} annually, before the first leaves have fully developed.

Once suckering and <b>green</b> <b>harvesting</b> have been completed, the maximum number of clusters allowed per vine is 14.|$|R
50|$|Winemaking in Bordeaux is the {{collection}} of processes used to make Bordeaux wine.

50|$|In {{the absence}} of other techniques, makers of dessert wine have to produce their sugar in the vineyard. Some grape varieties, such as Muscat, Ortega and Huxelrebe, {{naturally}} produce a lot more sugar than others. Environmental conditions have a big effect on ultimate sugar levels; the vigneron can help by leaving the grapes on the vine until they are fully ripe, and by <b>green</b> <b>harvesting</b> and pruning to expose the young grapes to the sun. <b>Green</b> <b>harvesting</b> reduces the number of bunches on a vine early in the summer, so that the sugar production of the leaves is divided between fewer bunches. Unfortunately the vigneron cannot control the sun, but a sunny year can help sugar levels a lot. The semi-sweet Auslese wines in the German wine classification are probably {{the best example of}} this approach; most modern winemakers perceive that their customers want either fully dry or 'properly' sweet dessert wines, so 'leave it to nature' is currently out of fashion. But most of the Muscats of ancient times were probably made this way, including the famous Constantia of South Africa.|$|R
2500|$|Valentini and the {{new wave}} of artisanal winemakers often utilize {{extensive}} pruning, <b>green</b> <b>harvesting,</b> and low crop yields in the vineyard. As well as extended maceration for red wines, and oak aging for whites to produce wines that have received some critical acclaim. According to Matt Kramer, Valentini's Trebbiano d'Abruzzo maybe [...] "Italy's single greatest dry white wine". Wine expert Jancis Robinson describes it as [...] "one of Italy's most distinctive dry white wines." ...|$|R
50|$|Enfariné noir is a late {{ripening}} {{variety that}} can be very productive and high yielding if not kept in check by winter bud pruning, low vigor rootstock and perhaps even <b>green</b> <b>harvesting.</b> The vine tends to create large cluster thick-skin berries that tend to be larger than other Vitis vinifera varieties. There are very few viticultural hazards that Enfariné noir is susceptible to with the vine being resistant to most grapevine diseases.|$|R
