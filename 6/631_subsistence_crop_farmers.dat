40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop an econometric model to {{forecast}} paddy agricultural structure in mid and long-term. In general, when we develop such models, we need to take notice of the supply and the demand side as well as the interaction between them. However, in this study, we discuss only three areas in Kyoto prefecture. So, our model sets much value on reconstructing regional output. We also assume the parameters of our model for each region, make mid and longterm forecasts based on the model, and examine the effectiveness. The results of this analysis shows; (1) arge scale agricultural corporations (Type I) stay the same in production of rice and increase open culture production of vegetables, (2) <b>subsistence</b> <b>crop</b> <b>farmers</b> (Type III) decrease in number and get older, but keep the size of production, (3) middle scale private management (Type IV) keeps decreasing in number and (4) farmers who work less than 150 days per year are on the average growing older and their numbers are decreasing...|$|R

40|$|In the dry {{areas of}} Nicaragua, white-grain sorghum is an {{important}} <b>subsistence</b> <b>crop</b> for resource-poor <b>farmers.</b> From 2002 to 2007, participatory varietal selection (PVS) was implemented in three regions {{with the aim of}} identifying new varieties matching small farmers' needs. This paper describes the general approach, the partnership and the methods used to identify farmers' selection criteria (FSC), as well as the evaluation of new germplasm using the scoring method. Data analysis involved relating farmers' evaluation data to agronomic data and farmers' selection decisions (FSD), using Spearman correlations and the chi-square test. In the three regions, higher grain yield and good grain quality for making tortillas were identified as the two main FSCs for both the 'tortillero' and 'millón' sorghum types; the ranking of the other important FSC differed between the sites and the sorghum types. Our data shows that farmers' scores for earliness were highly correlated with breeder's observations while farmers' assessments of grain yield were correlated with measured yield in half the cases, depending on their knowledge of the crop. The study shows that in evaluating grain quality the farmers used several specific traits which were not considered by breeders. Overall appreciation, grain yield and grain quality were the key farmers' criteria that contributed to FSD. The PVS work enabled breeders to obtain a better understanding of farmers' criteria as well as identifying new progenitors, which should be useful for the sorghum breeding schemes in Central America in the future. Furthermore, by exploring wide genetic diversity, it was possible to release several farmer-preferred and high-performing varieties within a fairly short period...|$|R

A multi-stage random sampling technique was adopted to select 96 beneficiaries and structured questionnaires as well as personal interview were used to collect data. Probit and logit models were used to analyse the factors influencing credit delinquency among food <b>crop</b> <b>farmers</b> in the state. Result of the descriptive analysis of the socio-economic characteristic of respondents revealed that 93 % of male and 72 % of female food <b>crop</b> <b>farmers</b> had one form of formal education ranging from primary to tertiary education. Empirical result from the Probit and logit models were similar and showed that borrower’s non-farm income, credit amount received, household size, net farm profit and farm size are determinants of credit delinquencies among food <b>crop</b> <b>farmers</b> in Akwa Ibom state. The study also discovered that the probability of food <b>crop</b> <b>farmers</b> being credit delinquent is about 0. 427 ceteris paribus.

40|$|Perceptions {{of climate}} change by rural {{communities}} are centered on observations of variations in temperature and rainfall patterns supported by observations and projections on climate alterations {{in the form of}} increased temperatures and scarce rainfall by scientists worldwide. The present study documented perceptions of climate variation and the community’s ability to adapt to climate change hazards threatening the production of <b>subsistence</b> <b>crops.</b> Data were collected through interactions with 100 participants. In the study, climate change is explained as variations in temperature and rainfall patterns which resulted in excessive heat, erratic rainfall patterns and drought negatively impacting on <b>subsistence</b> <b>crop</b> production. Community members have the potential to limit the impacts of climate hazards on <b>subsistence</b> <b>crop</b> production. The negative impacts of climate hazards are limited by community members’ indigenous knowledge of rainfall prediction, the seasons, crop diversification and mixed cropping. Mulching and the application of kraal manure improve the soil structure and fertility to reduce crop failure. These adaptation measures are resilient to the negative impact of climate hazards and may be helpful in the development of adaptation policies to assist rural communities vulnerable to climate change hazards...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{designed}} to compare the technical efficiency of food <b>crop</b> <b>farmers</b> along gender line. The stochastic production function, using the Cobb – Douglas functional form was used to estimate and compare the effects of some socio-economic characteristics of farmers on technical efficiency {{of male and female}} food <b>crop</b> <b>farmers</b> in the study area. Estimated results revealed that some socio-economic attributes such as education (b =- 0. 195 and b =- 0. 237), age (b =- 0. 297 and b =- 0. 051), household size (b =- 0. 216 and b =- 0. 319) and credit (b =- 0. 023 and b =- 0. 096) for both male and female food <b>crop</b> <b>farmers</b> respectively, revealed negative relationship with technical inefficiency, indicating that they (variables) decrease technical inefficiency and hence increase technical efficiency of the food <b>crop</b> <b>farmers</b> in the study area. But the coefficient of farming experience (b = 0. 163 and b = 0. 133) was positively signed for both male and female food <b>crop</b> <b>farmers</b> respectively. This shows a positive relationship with technical inefficiency effects, and negative relationship with technical efficiency. The study further revealed the significant differences in the socioeconomic attributes of male and female food <b>crop</b> <b>farmers,</b> resulting in differences in their technical efficiencies in the study area.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{factors that}} influenced fertilizer use intensity among arable <b>crop</b> <b>farmers</b> in Abak agricultural zone in Akwa Ibom state, Nigeria. Primary {{data were obtained}} from 150 arable <b>crop</b> <b>farmers</b> in the zone. Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analysis were used to analyze data collected. The result reveals that majority of farmers were getting old and there is low social capital accumulation among arable <b>crop</b> <b>farmers.</b> Also, age, gender, household size, farm size, perceived price of fertilizer, value of farm output, extension agent visit, number of goats and sheep own by farmers, and decision to own poultry by farmers {{as well as the}} distance to fertilizer selling point are significant factors affecting fertilizer use intensity among arable <b>crop</b> <b>farmers</b> in Abak agricultural zone in Akwa Ibom state. The study recommends that Akwa Ibom state government should further subsidize the price of fertilizer to make fertilizer more affordable to small holder farmers. In addition, arable crop farming households in the state should be sensitized on the current method of family planning as this would help to reduce non-farm cost and help increase fertilizer procurement. Furthermore, the extension unit of the state ministry of Agriculture should be strengthened to educate arable <b>crop</b> <b>farmers</b> more on fertilizer usage...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Masters of Development Studies, 2016. Cataloged from PDF version of dissertation. Includes bibliographical references (page 29 - 30). Farming households from some parts of Bangladesh have increasingly been taking up maize production through efforts of a development project called Katalyst as there is huge demand in the national market for maize grains {{to be used for}} poultry feed. Maize primarily is used as a cash crop since Bangladeshi households are not habituated with maize consumption. The issue of Household Food Security at the level of farmers mainly depend on their own subsistence production. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} understand whether by switching into maize from <b>subsistence</b> <b>crop</b> production system, <b>farmers</b> are being worse-off in terms of their household level food security. Maize productions have been found to be positively interlinked with economic advance-ment of farmers, notwithstanding it depends on variety of factors. It is interesting to look at the findings accrued from an independent study commissioned by Katalyst which made conclusion on the economic impact of maize cultivation. Drawn from the large n farmers’ survey and verified with the in-depth small n farmer interviews, farmers have reported to make more income through maize production as opposed to their previous crop during the same season. Evidence shows that the economic gains of farmers through maize production have led to increased level of household food security primarily in relation to nutritional balance. For example, 80 % of the survey respondents mentioned that their food habit improvised with the additional earnings from maize production. Farming households have reported a rise in affordability consume protein based foods such as fish or meat on an weekly basis with the additional income generated from maize production. Evidence shows that there lies a positive relationship between increased maize production and household food security. Farmers have positive perception about maize cultivation and they feel that by increasing maize production they have been able to reduce their dependency on rice crop. Jannat Adib ChowdhuryM.

The second aim is to investigate if other factors than farm size affect crop portfolio choice and the final aim is to see if those crop portfolio models can be improved. A case-study research design and qualitative interviews are used. The primary data is based on a fieldwork that took place from the 18 th of February until the 7 th of March 2009 in the study area. From a theoretical perspective the underlying assumptions of the Marcel Fafchamp's model Crop portfolio choice under multivariate risks is discussed in connection to the result of the study. Interviews were made with six households of different farm size. The result of the study indicates that both small-scale and large-scale farmers are using cash crops. The fact that all crops can be used for selling, gives also small-scale farmers in season with higher prices, an opportunity to sell a large share of their crops. It's thereby not possible to state that large-scale farmers devote a larger share of their land for cash <b>crop</b> than small-scale <b>farmers</b> do. ...|$|R
