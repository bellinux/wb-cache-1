In more detail we have compared our experimental results with the results of classical simulations and the results gave a very adequate description of the experimental results except at the lowest temperature where the form of the dispersion relation was correct but the energies of the excitations were in error. Nevertheless, classical simulations do provide an effcient and easily implemented methodology for modelling the excitations in the Heisenberg magnets. The damping of the excitations was experimentally found to follow a T 2 behaviour over all wave vector and energy scales. This is in agreement with the classical simulations but inconsistent with analytic theories of the damping for the 2 D Heisenberg model and in particular does not agree with hydrodynamic behaviour or dynamic scaling. The result is similar to that found in 3 D Heisenberg systems and suggests that more analytic theory is needed to explain the experimental results for both 2 D and 3 D Heisenberg magnets...|$|R
