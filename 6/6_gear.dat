40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to reveal the pattern of gear tooth crack growth under variable-amplitude loading. To this end, a {{nonlinear}} dynamic model is proposed to describe the gear tooth crack growth. The state variables of the model are crack length and crack opening stress. The dynamics of crack growth is modeled as a modified Paris equation based on the concept of crack closure. A nonlinear second-order autoregressive equation is developed to model the dynamic behavior of the crack opening stresses. The model parameters are estimated by means of a two-step estimation method because of relatively small sample size of crack length data for G <b>6</b> <b>gear</b> tests. The model is also validated with the crack growth data of the G <b>6</b> <b>gear...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{earliest}} form of {{a manual}} transmission {{is thought to have}} been invented by Louis-René Panhard and Emile Levassor in the late 19 th century. This type of transmission offered multiple gear ratios and, in most cases, reverses. Almost all automobiles as of today are driven by internal combustion engines because of the high power to weight ratio, relatively good efûciency and compact energy storage associated with it. The major disadvantage with this engine is it’s incapability of producing torque from the rest, which is the characteristic of ideal traction hyperbola. This difference between characteristics curve of the combustion engine and the ideal traction hyperbola can be approximated by the use of a gear box. In this paper a gear box with 7 forward gears and 2 reverse gears has been described. A normal 7 speed MT requires 8 gear pairs to provide 7 forward and 1 reverse gear but this paper presents a novel 7 speed MT designed with just <b>6</b> <b>gear</b> pairs giving 7 forward and 2 reverse gears thereby saving both the material cost as well as meeting the space constraints...|$|E

40|$|Shrinkage {{behavior}} {{is a crucial}} problem in manufacturing plastic molded gear. This is because it negatively affects the dimensional stability and accuracy of the involute profile, {{as well as the}} concentricity, roundness, tooth spacing uniformity, and size of the gear. By integrating the Taguchi robust design, Grey relational analysis, and principal component analysis, we investigated the dimensional stability related to the shrinkage of tooth thickness, addendum circle, and dedendum circle of molded gear via the optimization of processing parameters and glass fiber reinforcement. The results revealed that the optimal combination of the processing parameters of the molded gear to achieve minimum shrinkage is melt temperature of 260 °C, packing pressure of 60 %, packing time of 5 [*]s, and cooling time of 30 [*]s. The melt temperature showed the highest comparability sequence among the four key process parameters examined, followed by packing pressure, cooling time, and packing time. Meanwhile, the presence of glass fibers induced higher deviations of tooth thickness, addendum circle, and dedendum circle than those of the unfilled polyamide <b>6</b> <b>gears...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper aims at {{improving}} {{the design of}} torque sensor used in the EPS system. Such design not only integrates the torque and the corner signal, but also saves space. By using Matlab interior point method, the gear system parameters are optimized andthe weight {{and the size of}} the sensor are reduced. Bench test results demonstrate that the measurement accuracy of this self-designed sensor is able to meet the demands of EPS. 1. Design of the torque and angle sensor gear set The structural design of sensor gear is shown in fig 1 [1]. We define gear 1 and gear 2 to have the same number of gear teeth; the duplex gears 3, 4, and 5 to have the same number of <b>gear</b> teeth; <b>gear</b> <b>6,</b> 7 with the same amount of gear teeth. <b>Gear</b> 1, <b>6,</b> 8 and double gear 3 hence become the main concerns in parameter design. The transmission ratio is respectively: Z 1 =Z 2 = 84 ；Z' 3 =Z’ 4 =Z’ 5 = 15 ；Z 3 =Z 4 =Z 5 = 45 ；Z 6 =Z 7 = 35 ；Z 8 = 36 (1) In Eqs. 1, Z’ 3 refers to the teeth number of the medium-small-sized duplex gear. Z 3 refers to the teeth number of the medium-large-sized duplex gear. Fig 1 Sensor gear arrangement To set the steering wheel atthe initial position for angle 0 °, then the angle difference between pinion 6 and pinion 8 is 0 ° too. If the steering wheel’s rotation angle is, then the angle difference between <b>gear</b> <b>6</b> and <b>gear</b> 8 is, thus the steering wheel’s rotation angle corresponds with the angle difference of the pinions. Therefore, the measurement of the steering wheel’s rotation angle can be converted into the measurement of the angle difference between the two pinions. According to the transmission ratio, when the rotation angle is, the turning angle of <b>gear</b> <b>6</b> is and the turning angle of gear 8 is 3 7...|$|R
