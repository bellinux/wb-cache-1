30|$|Comparing {{our results}} to recent {{measurements}} {{of high quality}} 3 D cavities [45] with quality factors up to 7 × 10 ^ 7 indicate that improving the surface treatment of rectangular waveguides {{may lead to a}} even lower attenuation constant of rectangular waveguides down to ∼ 10 ^- 4 dB/m. Furthermore, our measurements show that the loss tangent tanδ strongly dependents on the PTFE composite where tan δ∼ 2 × 10 ^- <b>6</b> of <b>PTFE</b> have been reported at cryogenic temperatures [46, 47] about a factor of 4 lower than those measured here.

What is more, these laser surface treatments {{have been shown to}} affect the adhesion characteristics and bio-functionality of those materials. This paper details the use of a Synrad CO 2 laser marking system to surface treat nylon 6, <b>6</b> and polytetrafluoroethylene (<b>PTFE).</b> The laser-modified surfaces were analyzed using 3 D surface profilometry to ascertain an increase in surface roughness when compared to the as-received samples. The wettability characteristics were determined using the sessile drop method and showed variations in contact angle for both the nylon <b>6,</b> <b>6</b> and <b>PTFE.</b> For the PTFE it was shown that the laser surface treatment gave rise to a more hydrophobic surface with contact angles of up to 150 ° being achieved. For the nylon 6, 6, it was observed that the contact angle was modulated approximately ± 10 ° for different samples which could be attributed to a likely mixed state wetting regime. The effects of the laser surface treatment on osteoblast cell and stem cell growth is discussed showing an overall enhancement of biomimetic properties, especially for the nylon 6, 6. This work investigates the potential governing parameters which drives the wettability/adhesion characteristics and bioactivity of the laser surface treated polymeric materials...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{endovascular}} correction (eC) {{has emerged}} {{in recent years as}} a possible alternative to surgical revision (Sr) in case of bleeding complications after peripheral bypass (PB). The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the effcacy and safety of EC compared to SR in case of bleeding complications of PB. MeTHodS: From January 2004 to December 2014, we have submitted 32 patients to surgery for acute bleeding in previous PB (25 venous bypass, in situ or reversed, <b>6</b> <b>PTFe</b> bypass and 1 composite bypass). The cause of the bleeding was the dehiscence of proximal anastomosis in 14 patients, the dehiscence of distal anastomosis in 11 patients and the rupture of the graft in 7 patients. all patients postoperatively underwent anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, antibiotic therapy and close ultrasound follow-up. Patency rate, limb salvage rate and survival rate in the short term were assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves. reSUlTS: of the 32 patients treated for acute bleeding in previous PB, 11 underwent endovascular correction with a technical success of 100 % (no need for reintervention), while in 21 patients a surgical revision was performed. among the latter, in 4 cases (19. 1 %) an early bleeding occurred, and endovascular correction was promptly performed solving the bleeding in the absence of sequelae (then a total of 15 patients were treated by endovascular correction). The 12 -month patency, limb salvage and survival rates were respectively 71. 4 %, 88. 2 % and 88. 2 % in the Sr group and 80 %, 93. 3 % and 100 % in the eC. ConClUSionS: This topic underlines that endovascular correction after peripheral bypass bleeding is an attractive alternative to surgery, but there are still a few data to change the gold standard treatment. randomized clinical trials comparing the two treatment options are warranted...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{re-establishment}} of patency in a stenosed or thrombosed native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) {{is fundamental}} to regaining adequate hemodialysis through the same cannulable vein. Many surgeons {{have been reluctant to}} use even small segments of synthetic grafts in AVF revisions because of a perception that these would lead to poor results; however, studies comparing various treatment options are scarce. This study compared the use of short (< <b>6</b> cm) polytetrafluoroethylene (<b>PTFE)</b> segments with pure autologous repair in stenosed or thrombosed native fistulas. MethodsThe cumulative postintervention primary patency rates of two groups of hemodialysis patients receiving different surgical revision operations of their vascular accesses were prospectively compared. Group I (n = 30) comprised patients who presented with stenosed or thrombosed native fistulas and received short (2 to <b>6</b> cm) interposition <b>PTFE</b> grafts placed after the stenosed or thrombosed outflow vein segment was resected. These short PTFE grafts were not used for cannulation. Group II (n = 29) comprised patients who presented with dysfunctional or failed AVFs and underwent various types of pure autogenous corrections. AVF dysfunction or thrombosis was detected with clinical examination and color duplex ultrasound scanning. In all cases, on-table arteriography-fistulography was performed before surgical repair. Access adequacy was assessed in all patients postoperatively after the first puncture and every month thereafter (mean follow up 16. 7 months). ResultsNo statistically significant difference in patency was observed between the two groups. Postintervention cumulative patencies were 100 %, 88 %, and 82 % for group I and 90 %, 82 %, and 71 % for group II at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively (P =. 8). ConclusionsShort (< <b>6</b> cm) interposition <b>PTFE</b> segments used for the revision of failing or failed AVFs compare favorably to purely native repair and do not alter the autologous behavior of the initial access. These short PTFE revisions resulted in satisfactory midterm primary patency without further consumption of the venous capital by harvesting segments of vein from other locations and without compromising more proximal access sites. This practice is recommended and is justified as part of an aggressive access salvage policy addressed by many authors so far...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the volitional and magnetically-evoked neuromuscular performance of the quadriceps femoris at functional knee joint angles adjacent to full extension. Indices of volitional and magnetically-evoked neuromuscular performance (N= 15 healthy males, 23. 5 ± 2. 9 years, 71. 5 ± 5. 4 kg, 176. 5 ± 5. 5 cm) were obtained at 25 °, 35 ° and 45 ° of knee flexion. Results showed that volitional and magnetically-evoked peak force (PFV and PTFE, respectively) and electromechanical delay (EMDV and EMDE, respectively) were enhanced by increased knee flexion. However, greater relative improvements in volitional compared to evoked indices of neuromuscular performance were observed with increasing flexion from 25 ° to 45 ° (e. g. EMDV, EMDE: 36 % vs. 11 % improvement, respectively; F[2, 14]= 6. 8, p< 0. 05). There were no significant correlations between EMDV and EMDE or PFV and <b>PTFE,</b> at analogous <b>joint</b> positions. These {{findings suggest that the}} extent of the relative differential between volitional and evoked neuromuscular performance capabilities is joint angle-specific and not correlated with performance capabilities at adjacent angles, but tends to be smaller with increased flexion. As such, effective prediction of volitional from evoked performance capabilities at both analogous and adjacent knee joint positions would lack robustness. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This article reports {{our initial}} {{experience}} in 126 consecutive patients treated with placement of a surgically created polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) bicuspid pulmonary valve at The Congenital Heart Institute of Florida (CHIF). A bicuspid pulmonary valve is created with PTFE and sutured {{into the right}} ventricular outflow tract. PTFE bicuspid pulmonary valves were placed in 126 patients (age: range, 3. 1 - 64. 7 years, mean, 17. 9 years; weight: range, 14. 2 - 113. 6 kg, mean, 55. 4 kg). All patients had pulmonary insuffi-ciency, pulmonary stenosis, or both, most commonly after previous repair of tetralogy of Fallot (71 patients). Follow-up was up to 8. 3 years (range, 0 - 8. 3 years, mean, 3. 34 years). Operative mortality was 1 patient (0. 8 %). Late mortality was non–valve-related in 3 patients (2. 4 %). The initial 84 patents in this series received valves constructed from <b>PTFE</b> with 0. <b>6</b> -mm thickness. The next 42 patients received valves constructed from PTFE with 0. 1 -mm thickness. Six patients of 126 (4. 8 %) required replacement of the PTFE bicuspid pulmonary valve because of immobile and calcified leaflets. All 6 who required replacement of the PTFE bicuspid pulmonary valve initially received a valve constructed from porous 0. <b>6</b> -mm <b>PTFE</b> material. We currently use nonporous 0. 1 -mm PTFE, which does not allow cellular in-growth and thickening. Early echocardiographic follow-up of these valve leaflets made with 0. 1 -mm PTFE has demonstrated improved leaflet mobility and pliability and lower transvalvar gradients. PTFE bicuspid pulmonary valve implantation is safe and effective and demonstrates acceptable performance for the intermediate term. It is anticipated that using thinner 0. 1 -mmPTFEwill improve valve function and durability. Long-term follow-up is necessary to determine the true value of this technique...|$|R

Beagle dogs were anesthetized and abdominal aortas were incised equidistant between two clamps. The <b>6</b> mm <b>PTFE</b> grafts with 5 cm in length were {{inserted into the}} incised aorta by standard vascular techniques. The proximal anastomosis was performed in the end-to-end fashion and the distal anastomosis in the end-to-side fashion. Animals {{were divided into two}} groups; one with cobra-head form (n= 5) and the other with straight form in cu end of the graft. All animals were fed a diet of 2. 5 % cholesterol added to commercial dog chow. Three months later, abdominal aortography was carried out and the animals were then sacrificed. The anastomosed grafts were examined macroscopically and by light-microscopy. The blood flow distribution at the distal anastomosis was measured immediately and three months after surgery. Patency rare was 75 % (3 / 4) in the S group and 80 % (4 / 5) in the C group. Though {{there was no significant difference}} in the rate of the distal blood flow (DBF) to porximal blood flow (PDF) at the distal anastomosis between both groups. The DBF in the S goup tended to be greater than that in the C goup. In addition, the anastomotic intimal hyperplasia in the distal anastomosis with the DBF>PBF tended to be smaller than with DBF≦PEF. The distal anastomotic intimal hyperplasia remarkably occurred in the host artery of the toe and in the graft of the heel. We suggest that, in the distal end-to-side anstomosis, anastomotic intimal hyperplasia in the straight form of the cut-end of the graft is smaller than that in the cobra-head form...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundVascular {{anastomosis}} is {{a complex}} task that requires multiple skills. Existing training methods lack the ability to objectively quantify surgical skill. In this study we tested a new vascular anastomosis model for bench training. Materials and methodsSurgical performance was assessed based on the new vascular anastomosis training model. Thirty- eight {{subjects were asked to}} (1) close the end of a <b>6</b> -mm polytetrafluoroethylene (<b>PTFE)</b> graft, using a continuous suturing technique with 6 - 0 polypropylene; (2) perform end-to-end and (3) end-to-side anastomosis using the same materials and techniques. ResultsThe mean age (sd) of all participants was 28. 3 (2. 1) years. More surgically experienced trainees did better in all measures of technical skill. Although there was a tendency for those with previous experience with the training model to do better in terms of the technical outcomes, these differences were not statistically significant. Multivariable analysis revealed that level of surgical training and type of anastomosis were the only significant factors related to completion time. ConclusionsOur study confirmed the impact of increasing surgical experience on the technical skills of surgical trainees. Trainees with higher levels of training made fewer errors and completed the procedures faster than those with lower levels of training...|$|R

Thirty-nine patients had malignant disease and required chemotherapy, while one patient with aplastic anemia needed frequent transfusions. Thirty-two grafts {{were placed in}} the arm (27 straight and 5 loop), and ten in the leg (femoral-femoral loop). Thirty-seven shunts consisted of <b>6</b> mm polytetrafluoroethylene (<b>PTFE),</b> and five were 6 mm Dacron®. The straight brachial artery to axillary vein PTFE graft was preferred, while the PTFE femoral loop graft was a satisfactory alternative. The loop arm graft was associated with a high complication rate and is no longer used. Local anesthesia was employed in all cases except for a 3 -year-old child. There was no operative mortality and no severe morbidity, despite subsequent myelosuppression by chemotherapeutic agents injected via these grafts. Thirty patients are alive, while ten died of their malignancy. Twenty-six grafts are functional and have been in place an average 4. 4 months (range: 1 to 14 mo.).

Step wedges of different materials were used to compare radiographic density with and without a copper filter to identify the effect of the copper filter at different energies and exposure times. The step wedges used were CRS 1018 (cold rolled steel), Stainless Steel 304 L, Al 1100, Al 6061 T <b>6,</b> titanium, copper, <b>PTFE</b> (polytetrafluoroethylene or Teflon), brass, carbon, magnesium, phenolic, tungsten, and tantalum. Out of the 14 step wedges tested, only 12 produced useful data, as tungsten and tantalum were both too dense to produce any useable images and data points. In the given time, we were able to run a total of 6 different series of tests at the following parameters: 130 kV for 15 min, 130 kV for 5 min, and 70 kV for 5 min; all with and without a copper filter.

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{compare the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of a bioresorbable paclitaxel-eluting wrap implanted with a synthetic vascular graft (treatment) versus the graft implanted alone (control). DesignProspective, randomized, controlled, multicentre, 2 -year clinical study conducted in adults scheduled to undergo femoropopliteal peripheral bypass surgery with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft. Materials and methodsHundred and nine subjects were randomized 2 : 1 to treatment or control. All subjects were implanted with a <b>6</b> mm expanded <b>PTFE</b> vascular graft; in addition, treated subjects had a 2. 5 cm× 4 cm paclitaxel-eluting wrap (1. 6 μg/mm 2) placed around the distal graft anastomosis. ResultsThe overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups. Treated subjects required fewer limb amputations than controls (15. 5 % vs 18. 4 %) and time to amputation for those that required amputation was twice as long (153 days vs 76 days). Among diabetics, this effect was pronounced with 13. 8 % of treated subjects requiring limb amputations compared with 23. 5 % of controls. Over the course of study, the diameter at the distal graft anastomosis was greater in treated subjects than in controls (difference of 2. 1 mm at 2 yr, p= 0. 03).

40|$|AbstractPurpose: {{the purpose}} of this {{retrospective}} study was to evaluate whether an inflow source proximal to the inguinal ligament had an adverse effect on infrapopliteal bypasses with complementary arteriovenous fistula/vein interposition (AVF/VI) when compared to similar bypasses originating from the common femoral artery (CFA). Patients and methods: over the last seven years, 112 infrapopliteal PTFE bypasses with AVF/VI were performed in 103 patients. There were 58 men and 45 women with ages ranging from 47 years to 88 years (mean 71 years). Indication for surgery was critical ischaemia in all. Seventy-seven (69 %) of these were secondary operations and 35 cases (31 %) were primary. A <b>6</b> -mm ringed <b>PTFE</b> graft was used in all cases. A complementary distal AVF/VI was added in all cases. In 56 cases, the bypass originated from the common femoral artery (group I) and, in the remaining 56, it originated from the external or common iliac artery (group II).

The {{objective of this}} report is to describe the immediate and long-term results in a series collected over two decades. Of the approximately 1, 500 lower extremity revascularizations performed between 1978 and 1998, 81 infrapopliteal bypass cases using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as conduit in 77 patients were identified. Auto-genous conduit was unavailable (86 %) due to prior surgery: {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (25 %), femoro-popliteal bypass (60 %), or femoro-distal bypass (23 %). All cases were done for critical ischemia using <b>PTFE</b> (<b>6</b> mm, 95 %; ring reinforced, 54 %) under general (75 %) or regional (25 %) anesthesia.

Results from both the initial adhesion tests and extended DLVO (xDLVO) model correlated with each other, with PVC (12 % surface coverage/mm(2)), <b>PTFE</b> (<b>6</b> % surface coverage/mm(2)), and PP (6 % surface coverage/mm(2)), shown to be the better performing support materials for initial adhesion, as well as subsequent biofilm formation by M. barkeri after 72 h. Experimental results of these three support materials showed that the type of material strongly influenced the extent of adhesion from M. barkeri (p< 0. 0001), and the xDLVO model was able to explain the results in these environmental conditions. Therefore, DLVO physicochemical forces were found to be influential on the initial adhesion of M. barkeri. Scanning electron microscopy suggested that production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from M. barkeri could facilitate further biofilm development.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The true {{aneurysm}} {{formation of}} the autogenous saphenous vein graft (ASVG) is a very rare complication after bypass surgery [1 - 5]. In 1969 Pillet [1] first described a true fusiform aneurysm {{formation of the}} ASVG which had {{been used as a}} replacement of the iwured superficial femoral artery in 26 -year-old male patient. We present nine cases. CASE!. A 71 -year-old man with previous history of arterial hypertension and higher serum lipid level, was admitted with an asymptomatic pulsating swelling of the medial portion on the thigh. Five years ago the bellow knee F-P bypass with ASVG due to occlusive disease has been performed. The transfemoral angiography (Figure 1) showed patent graft with fusiform true aneurysm formation at its mid portion. This aneurysm has been replaced with PTFE graft. The pathohistological examination showed an atherosclerotic origin of the aneurysm. This patient died four years after operation due to myocardial infarction with patent graft. CASE 2. A 57 -year-old female with previous history of arterial hypertension and higher serum lipid level, had an elective resection and replacement of the superficial femoral artery aneurysm. For the reconstruction an ASVG was used. The saphenous vein showed postflebitic changes. Four years later she was admitted with asymptomatic pulsating mass of the mid portion of the thigh. The control transfemoral angiography showed patent graft with fusiform aneurysm formation of its mid portion. After aneurismal resection, an above knee F-P bypass with 8 mm PTFE graft was performed. A pathohistological examination showed a partially degenerated elastic membrane with fragmentation and disruption, without atherosclerosis (Figure 2). During the follow up period an elective resection of the subclavian artery aneurysm as well as abdominal aortic aneurysm, were performed. CASE 3. A subclavian artery aneurysm caused by TOS has been repaired with sapehnous vein graft at 40 -year-old female patient with regular arterial tension and normal serum lipid level. The pathohistologycal examination showed an intimai fibroelastosis associated with intimai and medial connective tissue proliferation of the aneurysm. The atherosclerotic changes were absent. Four years later this patient has been admitted urgently with ischemia of the left hand, absent distala arterial pulses and with asymptomatic pulsating mass over the supradavicular area. The Duplex ultrasonography and angiography, showed aneurysm of the ASVG, associated with occlusion (embolism) of the brachial artery (Figure 3). This aneurysm has been replaced with <b>6</b> mm <b>PTFE</b> graft Transbrachial thrombembolectomy has been performed too. The pathohistological examination showed a non atherosclerotic origin of the ASVG aneurysm (Figure 4). Three years after secondary operation the PTFE graft is patent. Echocardiography of the same patient showed mitral valve prolaps, probably caused by connective tissue disorder. CASE 4. A 56 -year-old female patient was admitted urgently, due to hemorrhagic shock and giant pulsating swelling over the popliteal space. The Duplex ultrasonography and transfemoral angiography showed ruptured popliteal artery aneurysm. This patient had arterial hypertension and higher lipid level. During the urgent operation using dorsal approach, an aneurysm has been replaced with ASVG. A pathohistological examination showed an atherosclerotic origin of the aneurysm. Ten days postoperatively due to bleeding from the wound, a new urgent surgical procedure was performed. Intraoperatively 1 cm long graft laceration was found, while postoperative bacteriological examination showed an infection caused by Staphylococcus Aureus. The graft has been removed, and new extraanatomic, subcutaneous bypass from the superficial femoral to anterior tibial artery using ASVG was performed. Three years later this patient was admitted urgently with giant pulsating mass and skin necrosis at the knee region, associated with hemorrhagic shock. The control angiography showed a ruptured aneurysm of the ASVG (Figures 5 and 6). The aneurysm was replaced with <b>6</b> mm <b>PTFE</b> graft. The pathohistological examination showed an atherosclerotic origin of the aneurysm. Two year postoperatively, the new graft is patent. CASE 5. A 65 -year-old man with previous history of arterial hypertension and high serum lipid level, was admitted with pulsating swelling and skin necrosis at the portion on the thigh. Nine years ago the bellow knee F-P bypass with cephalic vein due to occlusive disease has been performed. Transfemoral angiography showed patent graft associated with ruptured fusiform aneurysm at its mid portion. This aneurysm has been replaced with <b>6</b> mm tubular <b>PTFE</b> graft. The postoperative patohistological examination showed an atherosclerotic changes at the resected aneurysm. This patient was followed two years, and graft is patent., CASE 6. A 62 -year-old male patient was admitted urgently, with giant pulsating swelling over the popliteal space and hemorrhagic shock. The Duplex ultrasonography and angiography showed ruptured popliteal artery aneurysm. The patients had previous history of arterial hypertension and higher serum lipid level. The aneurysm has been replaced with ASVG. Pathohistological examination showed an atherosclerotic origin of the aneurysmal sac. Seven days postoperatively, a massive bleeding from the wound due to graft infection, occurred. New urgent operation showed complete graft abrupption at the site of proximal anastomosis, while postoperative bacteriological examination showed a presence of Staphylococcus Aureus. The graft was removed and new extraantomic, subcutaneous bypass from the superficial femoral to the anterior tibial artery with contralateral ASVG, was performed. The patient recovered very well. Five years latter this patient was admitted urgently with large painful pulsating mass in the thigh. The angiography showed and ASVG fusiform aneurysm. The aneurysm has been replaced with <b>6</b> mm <b>PTFE</b> graft. The pathohistological examination showed an atherosclerotic origin of the resected aneurysm (Figure 7). Two years after the operation, a new graft is patent. CASE 7. A 78 -year-old man with previous history of arterial hypertension and higher serum lipid level, has been admitted with an asymptomatic pulsating swelling of the medial portion on the thigh. Seven years ago the bellow knee F-P bypass with ASVG and exclusion of the poplietal artery aneurysm was performed. The Duplex ultrasonography and angiography showed a fusiform true aneurysm formation at the mid portion of the patent graft. The aneurysm has been replaced with femoro-anterior tibial artery bypass procedure using <b>6</b> mm <b>PTFE</b> graft. The pathohistological examination showed an atherosclerotic origin of the aneurysm. This patient died five days after the operation due to myocardial infarction with patent graft. CASE 8. A 65 -year-old male with previous history of arterial hypertension and higher serum lipid level, had an elective replacement of the popliteal artery aneurysm. For the reconstruction a PTFE graft was used. Two years postoperativelly this graft occluded due to changes on the crural arteries. From these reasons a new bypass from the superficial femoral to anterior tibial artery with saphenous vein graft, was performed. Nine years later she was admitted with painful pulsating mass of the mid portion of the thigh. The Duplex ultrasonography and transfemoral angiography showed patent graft with fusiform aneurysm formation of its mid portion. The ASVG aneurysm was replaced with 8 mm Dacron graft. A pathohistological examination showed atherosclerotic origin of the ASVG aneurysm. One year latter this graft is patent. CASE 9. A 65 -year-old male with previous history of arterial hypertension and higher serum lipid level, has been admitted due to disabling claudications discomfort caused by aorto-iliac occlusive disease. Nine years earlier a right sided aorto-renal bypass with ASVG was performed due to occlusive disease and renovascular hypertension. An translumbar aortography showed occlusion of the aortic bifurcation associated with fusiform aneurysm formation of ASVG (Figures 8, 9 and 10). During the same operation an aorto-bifemoral bypass and repairing of ASVG aneurysm with Dacron grafts, were performed. A pathohistological examination showed atherosclerotic origin of the ASVG aneurysm. One year latter both grafts are patent. DISCUSSION The table 1 shows 45 true aneurysmal formation at ASVG after F-P bypass surgery in cases with occlusive diseases [1 - 25]. In his famous paper Szilagyi [3] reported a study of the biologic fate of ASVG in 260 patients with F-P bypass procedures, and he found 10 (3. 8 %) aneurysms. In 1973 De Weese [5] found 4 (1. 2 %) ASVG aneurysms after 350 F-P reconstructions, while in 1975 Vanttinen [6] found 1 (0. 9 %) such case after these procedures. In 1987 Yuanagyia [26], and in 1989 Martin [27] described cases of ASVG aneurysmal formation after subclavian artery aneurysm replacement. Yanagyia's patient had a Behcet disease. We also had one case of ASVG aneurysm after subclavian artery aneurysm repair, manifested with hand ischemia due to distal embolization. Gemperle[12]in 1986 decribed ASVG aneurysm which developed 18 years after replacement of the injured brachial artery. Carrasaquilla [28] has in 1972 described a case of ASVG aneurysm formation after replacement of the common carotid artery, while in 1998 Tekeuchi et al [29] described a case of an ASVG aneurysm after subclavian to vertebral artery bypass due to stenotic lesions of the both vertebral arteries. Four years later a giant ASVG aneurysm was found, and successfully resected. In 1990 Peer et al [30] reported two ASVG aneurysms seven and eight years after popliteal artery aneurysm replacement. In 1991 Kogel et al [31] described one such case 10 years after primary operation. In 1997 Loftus [32] described 10 new cases of the ASVG aneurysms after popliteal artery aneurysm repair. We had two such cases developed three and five years after primary operation. In three of our cases ASVG aneurysm showed an atherosclerotic origin, while in 3 non atherosclerotic. The exact mechanism of aneurysm degeneration of the ASVG in arterial position is unknown. There is likely a combination of factors including: - mechanical trauma during vein harvesting and operation [9, 30]; - weakness at branching sites in the vein [2, 9]; - potential weakness {{in the vicinity of the}} venous valves due to absence of the circular muscle cuff in the media of the vessel wall [5]; - infection [16]; - trauma caused by bony structures near the graft [18, 30]; - arteritis [13, 14, 26, 27, 30]; - atherosclerosis [2, 3, 5 - 11, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25]; - hemodinamic factors from the arterial pressure [23]; - transmural ischemie injury of the vein wall due to disrupting of the vasa vasorum after removing of the vein segments [28, 29, 33]; Brody cold this fenomen „devascularization of the venous graft" [34]; - diffuse nature of this process in patients with multiple aneurysmal changes [20, 32] (our cases 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8); - using of the cephalic [9], or superficial femoral vein [1] (case 7); - changed veins (one of our cases). The use of in situ bypass technique for arterial reconstruction would theoretically, minimize endothelial trauma by reducing operative manipulation, preserving vasa vasorum, and eliminating the pressure induced endothelial desquamation that has been associated with mechanical destination of reversed vein graft during their harvest. However, Sassoust [15] in 1986 reported 5 cases of true aneuryms of the ASVG after in situ F-P bypass. After Sassoust's new cases of ASVG aneurysm following F-P in situ bypass surgery were reported [22 - 24]. CONCLUSION Early ASVG aneurysm formation occurring six months after surgery has been found to be the result of preexisting unrecognized vein wall weakness or injury at the time of harvest, while aneurysm discovered 5 or more years postoperatively, were atherosclerotic in nature. The aneurysms of the ASVG are frequent, at patients with multiple aneurysms of natural arteries. The ASVG aneurysms require active surgical treatment. Then autologous vein grafts are not „material of choice" for replacement of aneurysmally changed ASVG after peripheral vascular reconstructions...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} femoropopliteal bypass to the infragenicular popliteal artery, {{in the absence}} of {{suitable}} saphenous vein have, in the main, been disappointing. We present a new type of composite graft, for use when the distal anastomosis is below the knee, which avoids the potential problems of prosthetic graft alone. The graft consists of a proximal segment of <b>6</b> mm expanded <b>PTFE</b> (Gore-Tex; or Impra), anastomosed to transposed non-reversed autologous saphenous vein. Forty-two patients were studied following unilateral, below knee composite femoropopliteal graft surgery for severe claudication or critical ischaemia. Pressure indices were calculated along with intraoperative flow rate, and all patients were followed up at regular intervals to assess graft patency. During the study period three patients died and graft occlusion occurred in a further eight. Analysis of the cumulative patency curve revealed that the majority of occlusions occurred in the first 3 months. The patency at 12 and 18 months was encouraging with values of 84 % and 79 % respectively. Comparison of pressure indices revealed a significant increase following surgery (P less than 0. 001). The postoperative pressure index appeared to predict the grafts likely to occlude and the intraoperative flow rates mirrored a similar trend. Grafts which occluded had a significantly lower pressure index and flow rate (P less than 0. 01, P less than 0. 002, respectively). Our results suggest that for infragenicular femoropopliteal bypass grafting where full length in-situ vein graft is not possible; a composite graft using PTFE with non-reversed vein is a good alternative...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Renal artery aneurysms is {{relatively}} uncommon with reported incidence ranges from 0. 3 % to 1 %. However, considering all visceral artery aneurysms {{the percentage of}} renal artery aneurysms {{is relatively}} high between 15 - 25 %. The distal forms of renal artery aneurysms sometimes require "ex vivo" reconstruction and kidney autotransplantation. CASE REPORT A 75 -year-old male presented with the right abdominal and back pain. He suffered from {{a long history of}} arterial hypertension and chronic renal failure {{over the last few months}} (urea blood = 19. 8 mmol/l; creatinine = 198 mmol/l). Duplex ultrasonography showed abdominal aortic aneurysm. Subsequent translumbarangiography revealed juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm associated with distal right renal artery aneurysm. The operation was performed under combined thoracic epidural analgesia and general anesthesia using transperitoneal approach. After the laparotomy, the ascending colon was mobilized and reflected medially followed by Kocher maneuver. The result was visualization of the anterior aspect of the right kidney, the collecting system, ureter as well as the right renal vein and artery with large saccular aneurysm located distally. After mobilization of the renal vessels and careful dissection of the ureter, the kidney was explanted. The operation was continued by two surgical teams. The first team performed abdominal aortic aneurysm resection and reconstruction with bifurcated Dacron graft. The second team performed ex vivo reparation of renal artery aneurysm. All time during the explantation, the kidney was perfused by Collins' solution. The saccular right renal artery aneurysm 4 cm in diameter was located at the kidney hilus at the first bifurcation. Three branches originated from the aneurysm. The aneurysm was resected completely. The longest and widest of three branches arising from the aneurysmal sac was end-to-end anastomized with <b>6</b> mm <b>PTFE</b> graft. After this intervention, one of shorter arteries was implanted into the long artery, and another one into PTFE graft. After 30 minutes of explanation, autotransplantation of the kidney into the right iliac fossa was performed. The right renal vein was implanted into the inferior vein cava, and PTFE graft into the right limb of Dacron graft. Immediately following the completion of both anastomoses, large volume of urine was evident. Finally, ureteneocystostomy was performed with previous insertion of double "J" catheter. In the immediate postoperative period, renal function was restored to normal, while postoperative angiography revealed all patent grafts. DISCUSSION The most common causes of renal artery aneurysms are arteriosclerosis, as in our case, and fibro-muscular dysplasia. Very often, renal artery aneurysms are asymptomatic and discovered only during angiography in patients with aneurysmal and occlusive aortic disease. Other cases include: arterial hypertension, groin pain and acute or chronic renal failure. Due to relatively small number of evaluated cases, the risk of aneurysmal rupture is not known. According to some authors, the overall rupture rate of renal artery aneurysm is 5 %, however, the rupture risk becomes higher in young pregnant woman. Several standard surgical procedures are available for the repair of renal artery aneurysms. These include saphenous vein angioplasty, bypass grafting, as well as ex vivo reconstruction with reimplantation or autotransplantation. Furthermore, interventional embolization therapy, as well as endovascular treatment with ePTFE covered stent, or autologous vein-coverage stent graft, have been also reported to be successful. CONCLUSION The major indications for surgical treatment of renal artery aneurysms are to eliminate the source of thromboembolism which leads to fixed renal hypertension and kidney failure, as well as prevention of aneurysmal rupture...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: In {{an attempt}} to improve graft patency results of {{prosthetic}} bypasses to infrapopliteal arteries, we used {{a new type of}} adjunctive technique that combines an arteriovenous fistula and vein interposition (AVF/VI). Methods: Over the past 5 years, 68 such reconstructions were performed in 62 patients with critical ischemia in whom a totally autogenous vein bypass was not feasible. Forty-seven patients (76 %) had had one or more failed ipsilateral infrainguinal bypasses. The AVF/VI was performed by transposing the central portion of the adjacent deep vein onto the side of the recipient artery. The distal end of a <b>6</b> -mm polytetrafluoroethylene (<b>PTFE)</b> ringed graft then was anastomosed to the hood of the AVF. The segment of vein interposed between the PTFE graft and the recipient artery widened the anastomosis and improved the compliance mismatch. Simultaneous pressure measurements of the radial artery and the distal portion of the graft were obtained in all cases. Results: Significant pressure gradients ranging from 35 to 70 mm Hg were detected in 26 bypasses (38 %), which led to banding of the venous outflow that decreased the gradient to within 20 mm Hg. A gradient ≤ 30 mm Hg was found in 28 bypasses (41 %), and no banding was required if the absolute intragraft systolic pressure was ≥ 100 mm Hg. Only 14 bypasses (21 %) had no detectable pressure gradients. Twenty-six bypasses originated from femoral arteries, 34 from iliac arteries, and 8 from patent proximal grafts. The recipient arteries were the anterior tibial artery in 33 cases, posterior tibial in 17, peroneal in 15, dorsalis pedis in 2, and lateral plantar in 1. All patients began a regimen of heparin 6 to 8 hours after surgery and continued to receive chronic anticoagulation. Cumulative 3 -year assisted primary graft patency rates were 78 %, 70 %, and 62 %, respectively. Cumulative 3 -year AVF patency rates were 65 %, 57 %, and 46 %, respectively. The 3 -year limb salvage rate was approximately 78 %. Conclusion: Adjunctive AVF/VI significantly improves infrapopliteal PTFE graft patency and limb salvage rates. The combination of a decreased compliance mismatch at the distal anastomosis and the abolishment of a large pressure gradient at the distal anastomosis while maintaining higher graft flow rates {{may have contributed to the}} improved results.

40|$|ObjectivesChoices for embolic {{protection}} during {{carotid stent}} procedures include distal filtration (DF) and proximal occlusion with flow reversal (POFR). DF devices {{are widely used}} but have produced only modest improvements in clinical outcomes. There is less experience with POFR devices but single center reports suggest reduced emboli detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD). To determine if POFR offers a significant improvement in embolic protection, we tested five DF devices and two POFR devices with 8 F and 10 F sheath design in an ex vivo angioplasty system using human carotid plaques excised en bloc. Physiologic pressures and flows were used and the efficiency of plaque fragment removal by these devices compared. MethodsThirty-three human carotid plaques removed en bloc were secured in tailored polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts. The distal <b>PTFE</b> was either <b>6</b> mm or 5 mm inner diameter (ID). Saline was delivered through the excised carotid plaque as follows: a cleaning 50 mL flush was done prior to the angioplasty procedure and discarded; further flushes of forward flow were done with five pressurized “pulsations” of 10 mL each (50 mL), peak pressure 140 mm Hg. Balloon angioplasty was done with a 4 mm and then a 6 mm balloon. DF flushes were applied after each angioplasty and “postprocedure” after the device was removed. With POFR, 50 mL were collected through the sheath after balloon angioplasty by either back-pressure of 20 mm Hg, 40 mm Hg or 60 mm Hg, or by aspiration. Postangioplasty pressurized forward flush of 50 or 100 mL was done as described. Each flush was collected, centrifuged, and examined for plaque fragments. Fragments greater than 60 microns were sized and counted on a 100 micron grid. ResultsWhen DF devices were used in <b>6</b> mm lumen <b>PTFE,</b> the percent of fragments trapped was poor (13. 7 % to 27. 8 %). There were {{no statistically significant differences}} between the devices. The capture of fragments improved (22 % vs 51. 4 %, P <. 001) when devices appropriate for a 6 mm lumen were used in a 5 mm PTFE “ICA”, functionally over-sizing the devices. POFR efficiency improved with increasing back-pressures and with repeated aspirations. Postprocedure, successive flushes of pressurized forward flow yielded additional plaque fragments and when the efficiency of POFR was assessed with forward flushing volumes similar to those used for DF, the efficiencies were similar, although larger fragments were more efficiently removed with POFR. ConclusionIn our model, both protection strategies were less than ideal. For POFR, high back pressures or multiple aspirations improve the efficiency of cerebral protection but additional fragments were released by pressurized flow even after aspiration of 150 mL of saline. DF devices create a pressure gradient and fragments apparently went around the device with pressurized flow in our PTFE lumen. Over-sizing of DF devices partially corrected this problem and increased over all DF efficiency to be comparable to POFR for smaller fragments but not for larger fragments...|$|R
