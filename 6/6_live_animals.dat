That fall, he negotiated with Boys Harbor, a non-profit youth services agency, to relocate El Museo from its home on Third Avenue to its present location: {{the main floor}} of the Heckscher Building, a multi-tenant, city-owned property at 1230 Fifth Avenue, between 104th and 105th Streets. In January 1978, Agüeros began El Museo's tradition of organizing a Three Kings Day Parade to celebrate the Epiphany. The Parade, held annually on January <b>6,</b> includes <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> (including camels), school groups, and props and costumes, such as paper-mache figures of the Three Kings, made by artists.|$|R

In the next part of work the statistics related to the transport of <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> are given. For example there are the numbers of transported <b>live</b> <b>animals,</b> the numbers of checking or the numbers of the infringements of the rules. Then a description of two specific international transports of <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> implemented by Czech zoological gardens is presented.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper was to assess {{challenges}} and opportunities of <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> export of Somali region a case study of Jigjiga zone. In order to assess the challenges and opportunity of <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> export of Somali region of Jigjiga zone, a total (census) of 20 individual <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> exporters were surveyed. In the process of answering the basic questions, a questionnaire that include demographic profiles, trading practices, factors that challenge <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> export was designed in open ended, closed ended and likert scales. Moreover, interviews were held with top officials of ARDB, RCA and animal health bureau. After the data has been collected, it was analyzed using simple statistical techniques (tables and percentages) and descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviations). The results of the study indicates the limited availability of financial institutions, unavailability of formal <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> exporters institutions, high marketing costs, multiple taxations, bureaucracy of government institutions, harassment by petty officials, and overall loose relationship with government bodies were challenging <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> export of the Jigjiga zone. It also shows that exporters were highly benefited from high trust and strong relationship with their business partners, familiarity with animal quality attributes demanded in importing countries and strong clan arrangements. The study also found that formal <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> export of the area is increasing but the illegal <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> export was highly challenging the formal <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> exporters and the revenue of the region. Along this, the study found different participants acting in <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> export system. Based on the major findings, recommendations were forwarded to existing and potential <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> exporters, and concerned government bodies...|$|R

40|$|Using simultaneous-equation models, {{this paper}} {{examines}} {{whether there is}} interdependence between smallholder’s net market positions in crop and <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> markets under mixed crop–livestock system. Household level data collected in 2009 from 1075 sample households in 10 districts of Ethiopia are used for the analyses. Results confirm the existence of interdependence between household’s net positions in crop and <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> markets and, relatively, the net position of households in the <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> market is dictated by their net position in the crop market. The interdependence between the two market positions shows that households stock <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> asset through selling surplus crops produced and finance crop purchase through <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> sales. The relative strength of the net market position in crop markets shows that prior to their involvement in <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> market, farm households analyse their position in crop production, consumption, marketable surplus, and the household’s ability {{to meet cash requirements}} through crop sale. Thus, policies/strategies enhancing smallholders’ participation in crop and <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> markets in mixed crop–livestock system should pay attention to the production and marketing of both commodities simultaneously.
