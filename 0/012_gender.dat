40|$|Abstract Introduction Occupational {{exposures}} to contaminated biological material in dental teaching settings can place students {{at higher risk}} of bloodborne infections. Methods This cross sectional study was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire culturally adapted to Portuguese language, Brazil. In total, 173 undergraduate dental students {{agreed to participate in}} the study, answered the questionnaire, and filled in the details about their own occupational exposures. The association of these factors was analyzed by the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test using Stata® software. Results High prevalence of occupational exposures (40 %) was observed among the participants, and 52 % of the accidents were not reported to the clinical instructor. The most frequent type of accident was related to &# 8220;puncture/cut/abrasion&# 8221; (56 %). Significant correlation was observed between number of exposures and academic year (p= 0. 002), age (p= 0. <b>012),</b> <b>gender</b> (p= 0. 010), and between number of injuries in the last 6 months and academic year (p= 0. 003). No significant correlation was observed between number of exposures and dominant hand, use of protective eyewear or Hepatitis B vaccination status (p> 0. 05). Conclusion Additional teaching strategies need to be developed to motivate adherence to occupational post-exposure protocols regarding biological material, improving the notification of the occupational exposures that occur among dental students...|$|E
40|$|Background: Depression {{is one of}} {{the most}} common health {{problems}} in college students. Understanding the associations between diet quality, total blood cholesterol, sleep quality, and depressive symptoms could aide in improving the mental health of this population. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between diet quality, omega- 3 fatty acid intake, total blood cholesterol levels, sleep quality, and depressive symptoms in college students. Design: Data were collected from a convenience sampling of participants in a general physical fitness course at Illinois State University. The Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI), a composite measure to assess adherence to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010, was used to analyze five-day food logs to determine diet quality. The food logs were also used to determine participants’ daily omega- 3 intake. Cholesterol was determined with a simple lipid profile. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to determine sleep quality while the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) assessed depressive symptoms. Data were analyzed using Spearman and partial correlations. Participants: All individuals enrolled in the general physical fitness course during 2016 were eligible to participate in the study with a total of 79 individuals consenting to participate. A total of 36 participants, aged 18 to 31 years, had complete data sets and were included in analysis. Results: Better diet quality, indicated by higher HEI scores were associated with better sleep quality (lower PSQI scores (r = -. 57, p =. 021). Better diet quality was also associated with higher intakes of omega- 3 after controlling for age (r =. 627, p =. <b>012)</b> and <b>gender</b> (r =. 614, p =. 015). Higher intakes of omega- 3 were associated with depressive symptoms after controlling for age (r =. 631, p =. <b>012)</b> and <b>gender</b> (r =. 613, p =. 015). Conclusions: Better adherence to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 was associated with higher consumption of omega- 3 and better sleep quality than individuals with poorer adherence to the guidelines. This study also indicates that omega- 3 fatty acid intake is positively associated with depressive symptoms. KEYWORDS: Cholesterol, Depression, Diet, Omega- 3 Fatty Acid, Slee...|$|R
40|$|Session: Periodontal ResearchObjectives: To {{investigate}} {{the characteristics of}} periodontal soft tissue appearance {{and their relationship to}} upper anterior tooth shape and gingival clinical parameters in a Chinese population. Methods: The study will recruit 30 systemic and periodontally healthy subjects, aged 18 - 35, from the Prince Philip Dental Hospital. Periodontal probing depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP) and tooth 13 - 23 attached gingiva width (GW) and crown width to crown length ratio (CW/CL) will be measured and analyzed. Results: Thus far a total of 20 subjects (9 males) with the mean age of 22. 58 (SD= 3. 93) have been recruited during the first 3 months of the study. The mean PD of these subjects was 1. 66 mm (SD= 0. 28) and mean BOP was 16. 5 % (SD= 0. 11). The mean GW was 5. 49 mm (SD= 1. 34). The mean GW was significantly correlated with CW/CL of tooth 22 (r= 0. 508, p= 0. 037) and 23 (r= 0. 595, p= 0. <b>012).</b> No <b>gender</b> differences were found among all the above variables. Conclusions: The preliminary results indicate the GW was associated with shape of tooth 22 and 23. GW was not affected by gender...|$|R
40|$|Lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy {{have been}} {{observed}} during long-term combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). We investigated whether consumption of a Mediterranean diet is associated with lower risk of body-shape changes in Croatian patients treated with CART. Between May 2004 and June 2005, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 136 adults with HIV- 1 infection who were treated with CART for at least 1  year. Lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy were assessed by self-report and physical examination. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet was determined by a 150 -item questionnaire; a 0 – 9 point diet scale was created that stratified respondents as having low adherence (< 4 points) and moderate to high adherence (≥ 4 points). Lipoatrophy was present in 41 % and lipohypertrophy in 32 % of participants. Non-smokers with a dietary score ≥ 4 had the lowest risk for lipoatrophy. Stavudine use, female gender, and duration of CART were also independently associated with {{a higher risk of}} lipoatrophy. A dietary score of ≥ 4 was associated with lower risk of lipohypertrophy (adjusted OR 0. 3, 95 % CI 0. 1 – 0. 7; P =  0. <b>012).</b> Female <b>gender,</b> longer duration of CART, and longer known duration of HIV infection prior to CART were also independently associated with higher risk of lipohypertrophy. In conclusion, Croatians who did not smoke and moderately or highly adhered to the Mediterranean diet were least likely to have the clinical syndrome of lipoatrophy. Moderate to high adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower risk of lipohypertrophy...|$|R
40|$|Serum {{uric acid}} (SUA) {{has long been}} {{associated}} with increased cardiovascular risk, with arterial stiffness proposed as a mediator. However, evidence on the association between SUA and arterial stiffness is limited to contradicting cross-sectional studies. In this analysis, we examined the longitudinal relationship between SUA and pulse wave velocity, a measure of arterial stiffness, in a community-dwelling population. We studied 446 women and 427 men participating in the BLSA (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging), with 1409 and 1434 observations, respectively, over an average period of 6 years. At baseline, mean ages {{of women and men}} were 65 ± 13 and 68 ± 13 years; mean SUA, 4. 6 ± 1. 1 and 5. 7 ± 1. 3 mg/dL; mean pulse wave velocity, 8. 1 ± 1. 7 and 8. 6 ± 1. 9 m/s, respectively (P< 0. 0001). In gender-stratified models accounting for age, blood pressure, renal function, metabolic measures, and medications, there was a significant interaction between SUA and follow-up time in men (β= 0. 69; P= 0. 0002) but not in women. Men, but not women, in the highest gender-specific SUA tertile at baseline (SUA≥ 6. 2 mg/dL in men and SUA≥ 4. 9 mg/dL in women) had a greater rate of pulse wave velocity increase over time than those in the lowest tertiles (β= 0. 997; P= 0. <b>012).</b> This <b>gender</b> difference was lost when the distribution of SUA in men and women was made comparable by excluding hyperuricemic men (SUA≥ 6. 2 mg/dL). In conclusion, higher SUA was associated with greater increase in pulse wave velocity in men but not women; this association was lost when men with SUA≥ 6. 2 mg/dL were not included, suggesting a threshold for SUA association with arterial stiffness, which is more frequently reached in men...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates {{trends in the}} {{prevalence}} of overweight and obesity in relation to gender and area of residence between two cohorts of students aged 11 – 13 years in Sicily. The analysis was performed on 1, 839 schoolchildren, with 924 and 915 children being studied in 1999 – 2001 and 2009 – 2010, respectively. The children who were enrolled during 2009 – 2010 had significantly higher body mass indexes (BMI), BMI z-scores, and waist circumferences than {{the children who were}} studied during 1999 – 2001 (p, 0. 0001 for all); these differences was also observed when the cohort was subdivided according to gender or residence area The prevalence of obesity increased significantly from 7. 9 % in 1999 – 2001 to 13. 7 % in 2009 – 2010 (p, 0. 0001), whereas thinness decreased significantly from 10. 1 % to 2. 3 % (p, 0. 0001) in the same periods. The increase of trends in the prevalence of obesity was significantly higher in males (9. 7 % vs. 17. 6 %, p = 0. 0006) than in females (6. 3 % vs. 9. 8 %, p = 0. 04) and was slightly higher in urban areas (8. 8 % vs. 14. 3 %, p = 0. 002) than in rural areas (7. 8 % vs. 13. 0 %, p = 0. <b>012).</b> The male <b>gender</b> was associated with a higher risk of being overweight or obese (odds ratio: 1. 63; 95 % confidence intervals: 1. 24 – 2. 15; p = 0. 0005) in 2009 – 2010 than in 1999 – 2001, after adjusting for age and the residence area. In conclusion, this study showed an increasing trend in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in Sicilian schoolchildren during the last decade and that this trend was related to gender, age and the area of residence. More specifically, our data indicated that the prevalence of obesity increased by 5. 8 %, the prevalence of thinness decreased by 7. 8 % and th...|$|R
40|$|Diagnosing {{shoulder}} pain {{conditions is}} a challenging area of musculoskeletal practice. Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is a clinical syndrome that indicates pain and pathology involving the subacromial bursa and rotator cuff tendons within the subacromial space. The three stages of SIS are subacromial bursitis, partial thickness and full thickness rotator cuff tears. The cause of SIS {{is believed to}} be multi-factorial with both extrinsic and intrinsic factors involved in its pathogenesis. Clinicians have traditionally diagnosed SIS using a clinical examination including a subjective history followed by confirmatory clinical tests. A review of the evidence for diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests highlights that individual tests have poor diagnostic accuracy. A combination of clinical tests or a clinical examination per se may be useful at ruling out rotator cuff tears, but is less accurate at detecting rotator cuff tears when it is present. There is consensus in the literature that particular combinations of signs and clinical features may be useful in diagnosing rotator cuff tears but not for diagnosing SIS. The vast majority of research to date examining the clinical diagnosis of SIS has been focused on individual clinical tests carried out by medical practitioners in specialist and tertiary care settings. This review has established that the majority of diagnostic accuracy studies for SIS and rotator cuff tears have had poor methodological design. This exploratory study was conducted with subjects undergoing a standardized clinical examination (index test) by a physiotherapist. The decision as to which specific tests were chosen for this research was based on supporting research within the literature and the test’s actual use within the New Zealand clinical setting. This included subjective history questions, active and passive shoulder movement tests and eleven SIS tests. Subjects were referred for a diagnostic ultrasound scan immediately following the clinical examination and results from the scan stood as the criterion reference standard. Thirty eight individuals (males n= 23, females n= 15) with new onset shoulder pain, who met the inclusion criteria, were assessed by a participating physiotherapist. Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios, negative likelihood ratios and respective 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for all variables of the examination. Individual variables from the clinical examination were tested for their association with the diagnostic ultrasound scan reference criterion using Pearson Chi-Squared Exact test. Potential predictor variables were retained as potential predictors for use in the logistic regression analysis to determine the most accurate set of clinical examination variables for diagnosing SIS and the individual pathological stages of SIS. The results indicate that no historical, subjective or objective features from the clinical examination are accurate in diagnosing SIS or rotator cuff tears. The presence of night pain demonstrated a significant correlation (P< 0. 02) with the criterion reference standard for the presence of subacromial bursa fluid/bunching. Night pain and pain with overhead activity has a high sensitivity for subacromial bursa fluid/bunching being present. The absence of night pain and the absence of pain with overhead activity are two subjective phenomena from a clinical examination that are useful in ruling out subacromial bursa fluid/bunching being present. Night pain was also found to be the best predictor of subacromial bursa fluid/bunching being present (P< 0. <b>012).</b> Male <b>gender</b> (P< 0. 034) was the best predictor of partial thickness rotator cuff tears while being 60 years of age or older (P< 0. 01) significantly correlated with full thickness rotator cuff tears. The Drop Arm Sign (P< 0. 01) and External Rotation Lag Sign (P< 0. 01) were significantly correlated with SIS and full thickness rotator cuff tears. Clinical tests for all three pathological stages of SIS and subacromial bursa fluid/bunching being present, had equivalent or if not greater diagnostic accuracy than previous report studies in the literature. The Hawkins-Kennedy Test and Neer Sign can be used in the primary care setting to rule out the presence of subacromial bursa fluid/bunching or SIS if the tests are negative. For mid to end stage SIS (rotator cuff tears) the Empty Can Test and Drop Arm Sign with their high sensitivity can be used to rule out rotator cuff tears especially to the supraspinatus tendon when the tests are negative. Despite the small sample size and other limitations of this study, the findings are an important addition to the current literature surrounding the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for SIS and rotator cuff tears. This is the first study to use physiotherapists as examiners and to be set in a primary care setting. The study is also the first to examine the diagnostic accuracy of a range of historical and subjective features from the clinical examination. The results found in the current study could be used by future studies as a starting point {{in the development of a}} clinical decision or prediction rule to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of SIS and rotator cuff tears...|$|R
