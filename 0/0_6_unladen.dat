40|$|For the {{development}} of highly active and robust catalysts for dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EBDH) to produce styrene; an important monomer for polystyrene production, perovskite-type oxides were applied to the reaction. Controlling the mobility of lattice oxygen by changing the structure of Ba 1 –xSrxFeyMn 1 –yO 3 –d(0 ≤ x≤ 1, 0. 2 ≤ y≤ 0. 8), perovskite catalyst showed higher activity and stability on EBDH. The optimized Ba/Sr and Fe/Mn molar ratios were 0. 4 / <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> and <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> / <b>0.</b> 4, respectively. Comparison of the dehydrogenation activity of Ba 0. 4 Sr <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Fe <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Mn <b>0.</b> 4 O 3 –d catalyst with that of an industrial potassium promoted iron (Fe–K) catalyst revealed that the Ba 0. 4 Sr <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Fe <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Mn <b>0.</b> 4 O 3 –d catalyst showed higher initial activity than the industrial Fe–K oxide catalyst. Additionally, the Ba 0. 4 Sr <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Fe <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Mn <b>0.</b> 4 O 3 –d catalyst showed high activity and stability under severe conditions, even at temperatures as low as 783 K, or at the low steam/EB ratio of 2, while, the Fe–K catalyst showed low activity in such conditions. Comparing reduction profiles of the Ba 0. 4 Sr <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Fe <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Mn <b>0.</b> 4 O 3 –d and the Fe–K catalysts in aH 2 O/H 2 atmosphere, reduction was suppressed {{by the presence of}} H 2 O over the Ba 0. 4 Sr <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Fe <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Mn <b>0.</b> 4 O 3 –d catalyst while the Fe–K catalyst was reduced.

The lattice oxygen in perovskite-structure was consumed by H 2, subsequently the consumed lattice oxygen was regenerated by H 2 O. So the catalytic performance of Ba 0. 4 Sr <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Fe <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Mn <b>0.</b> 4 O 3 –d was superior to that of Fe–K catalyst thanks to the high redox property of the Ba 0. 4 Sr <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Fe <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Mn <b>0.</b> 4 O 3 –d perovskite oxide...|$|R

The voltammetric properties in H 2 SO 4 solution indicate that Ti <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Ir <b>0.</b> 4 O 2 /Ti has more pronounced pseudocapacitive characteristics, caused by proton-assisted, solid state surface redox transitions of the oxide. At potentials negative to 0. 0 VSCE, this electrode is of poor conductivity and activity, while the voltammetric behavior of the Ti <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Ru <b>0.</b> 4 O 2 /Ti electrode is governed by proton injection/ejection into the oxide structure. The Ti <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Ir <b>0.</b> 4 O 2 /Ti electrode had a higher electrocatalytical activity for oxygen evolution, while the investigated anodes were of similar activity for chlorine evolution. The potential dependence of the impedance characteristics showed that the Ti <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Ru <b>0.</b> 4 O 2 /Ti electrode behaved like a capacitor over a wider potential range than the Ti <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> Ir <b>0.</b> 4 O 2 /Ti electrode, with fully-developed pseudocapacitive properties at potentials positive to 0. 60 VSCE.

Maiores porcentagens de mudas brotadas e altura de plantas foram obtidas nos tratamentos onde se utilizaram concentrações de óleo de eucalipto menores que 1, 0 % e na testemunha.

This work {{aimed to}} evaluate the sprouting of cuttings and yield of 'Amarela de Carandaí' peruvian carrot plants from cuttings which were disinfected with eucalyptus oil and rooted in polyethylene trays. In pre-rooting on trays, the Plan Puebla III experimental matrix was used to combine doses of eucalyptus oil and immersion periods, respectively: <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> %/ 36 s; 1. 4 %/ 36 s; <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> %/ 84 s; 1. 4 %/ 84 s; 1. 0 %/ 60 s; 0. 1 %/ 36 s; 1. 9 %/ 84 s; <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> %/ 6 s and 1. 4 %/ 114 s, added a control (0. 0 %/ 0 s). At field, ten cuttings per plot and six treatments were used: <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> %/ 36 s; <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> %/ 84 s; 1. 0 %/ 60 s; 0. 1 %/ 36 s; <b>0.</b> <b>6</b> %/ <b>6</b> s and <b>0.</b> 0 %/ 0 s. Highest percentages of sprouted cuttings and height of plants were obtained in treatments with doses of eucalyptus oil smaller than 1. 0 % and the control.
