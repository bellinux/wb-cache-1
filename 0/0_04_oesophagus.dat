Os instrumentos foram submetidos a ensaio de torção por meio de um dispositivo acoplado à uma máquina de ensaios mecânicos MTS (Material Test System). Esta máquina era conectada à um microcomputador onde foram registrados os valores de carga máxima aplicada a cada lima. Tais valores foram, posteriormente aos testes, convertidos em torque (em N. cm), seguindo a fórmula: torque = carga máxima x raio. Os valores de torque máximo para fratura foram analisados estatisticamente pelo teste t de Student. Os resultados mostraram que instrumentos de maiores conicidades (Grupo B e D) são mais resistentes à fratura do que os de conicidades menores (Grupo A e C). Os instrumentos K 3 0, 06 necessitam de maiores valores de torque máximo para fratura em relação aos Protaper.

The instruments were subjected to torsion test by means of an appliance coupled to a mechanical test machine MTS (Material Test System). This machine was connected to a microcomputer in which was registered the values of maximum load applied to each file. Such values were, after the tests, converted to torque (in N. cm), following the formula: torque=maximum load x radius. Maximum torque values for fracture were analyzed statistically by the Student's t. The results showed that more taper instruments (Groups B and D) are more resistant to fracture than the less taper ones (Groups A and C). The K 3 0, 06 instruments need higher values of maximum torque to fracture with relation to Protaper's ones.

Two hundred Profile® Vortex™ files of 25 mm length were divided equally into ten groups, one for each of the Profile® Vortex™ files 20 / <b>0.</b> <b>04,</b> 20 / <b>0.</b> 06, 25 / <b>0.</b> <b>04,</b> 25 / <b>0.</b> 06, 30 / <b>0.</b> <b>04,</b> 30 / <b>0.</b> 06, 35 / <b>0.</b> <b>04,</b> 35 / <b>0.</b> 06, 40 / <b>0.</b> <b>04,</b> and 40 / 0. 06. Two hundred EndoSequence™ files of 25 mm length were divided equally into ten groups of the same tip and taper sizes analogous to the Profile® Vortex™ file groups. Files were rotated at 500 rpm in a fixed groove in the metal block of the apparatus. The angle of deflection for all files was fixed at 33 degrees, determined using the Schneider method. The time from initiation of rotation to fracture was recorded and rotations to fracture were calculated. The data collected was analyzed using a multi-way ANOVA, followed by specific post-hoc contrasts comparing the two brands for each tip and taper combination. The results demonstrated that the Profile® Vortex™ files required significantly greater rotations to fracture than the EndoSequence™ (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) in all tip sizes in both <b>0.</b> <b>04</b> and <b>0.</b> 06 tapers.

Combinations {{of the following}} working parameters were analyzed: lateral forces of 0. 5 N, 1 N, and 2 N; tip angulations of 0 °, 45 °, and 90 °; power settings of low, medium, and high; and instrumentation time of 10, 20, 40, and 80 seconds. Defects were quantified using a 3 -dimensional optical laser scanner. Lateral force had the greatest influence on defect volume compared to tip angulation and power setting (β-weights 0. 53 ± <b>0.</b> <b>04,</b> <b>0.</b> 17 ± <b>0.</b> <b>04,</b> and <b>0.</b> 19 ± <b>0.</b> <b>04,</b> respectively). Lateral force and tip angulation had similar effects on defect depth, but both effects were greater compared to power setting (β-weights 0. 43 ± <b>0.</b> <b>04,</b> <b>0.</b> 49 ± <b>0.</b> <b>04,</b> and <b>0.</b> 19 ± <b>0.</b> <b>04,</b> respectively). The various combinations of the assessed working parameters showed synergistic effects resulting {{in a wide range}} of defect depths (14. 1 ± 1. 7 μm to 410. 5 ± 51. 1 μm) and volumes (0. 0084 ± 0. 0057 mm 3 to 1. 3 ± 0. 079 mm 3). Severe root damage (defect depth > 50 μm) at 40 seconds instrumentation time occurred under most combinations of lateral force, angulation, and power settings. The only exceptions were combinations of: 1) 0 ° angulation, 0. 5 N and 1 N lateral force at any power setting and 2) 45 ° angulation, 0. 5 N lateral force at low and medium power setting. The efficacy of the assessed magnetostrictive ultrasonic scaler may be adapted to the various clinical needs by adjusting the lateral force, tip angulation, and power setting. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Greenhouse experiment has been conducted to evaluate some synthetic (N-serve) and natural (neem cake and waste tea) nitrification inhibitors to improve fertilizer efficiency and reduce N-losses in rice fields. Nitrogen was applied as urea and ammonium sulfate at a rate of 60 mg/Kg soil. Results revealed that addition of inhibitors with both N fertilizer caused a significantly increase in both grain and straw yields rice, addition of <b>0.</b> <b>04</b> per cent neem cake with both urea and as gave the highest grain and straw yields of rice while the waste tea gave the lowest. The percentage increase of total yield with urea + inhibitor treatments ranged between 5. 8 per cent to 26 per cent when compared with urea alone, 26 per cent increase was recorded for <b>0.</b> <b>04</b> per cent neem cake treatment and 22. 4 per cent for N-serve, while 5. 8 per cent was recorded for <b>0.</b> <b>04</b> per cent waste tea treatment.

Results also showed that neem cake combined with both urea and AS was more effectiveness on N-uptake especially at applied rate (<b>0.</b> <b>04</b> per cent). The percentage increase in total N-uptake over urea alone was 31 per cent, 29 per cent and 5 per cent for <b>0.</b> <b>04</b> per cent neem cake, N-serve and <b>0.</b> <b>04</b> per cent waste tea respectively.
