40|$|An {{increasing}} body {{of research}} has linked the geographic distribution of lead with various indicators of criminal and antisocial behavior. The current study, using data from an ongoing project related to lead exposure in St. Louis City, MO, analyzed the association between aggregate blood lead levels and specific indicators violent crime within the city. Ecological study. St. Louis, Missouri. Blood lead levels. Official reports of violent crimes were categorized as 1) crimes involving a firearm (yes/no), 2) assault crimes (with or without a firearm), 3) robbery crimes (with or without a firearm), 4) homicides and 5) rape. With the exception of rape, aggregate blood-lead levels were statistically significant predictors of violent crime at the census tract level. The risk ratios {{for each of the}} outcome measures were as follows: firearm crimes <b>1.</b> <b>03</b> (<b>1.</b> <b>03</b> - <b>1.</b> 04), assault crimes <b>1.</b> <b>03</b> (<b>1.</b> 02 - <b>1.</b> <b>03),</b> robbery crimes <b>1.</b> <b>03</b> (<b>1.</b> 02 - 1. 04), homicide <b>1.</b> <b>03</b> (<b>1.</b> 01, 1. 04), and rape 1. 01 (0. 99 - <b>1.</b> <b>03).</b> Extending prior research in St. Louis, results suggest that aggregated lead exposure at the census tract level predicted crime outcomes, even after accounting for important sociological variables. Moving forward, a more developed understanding of aggregate level crime may necessitate a shift toward studying the synergy between sociological and biological risk factors such as lead exposure...|$|R

It {{is involved in the}} renin-angiotensin system (RAS), one of the body's major mechanisms important for maintaining the constant plasma concentration of electrolytes.

The Wnt pathway is RAS-independent, evolutionary conserved processes mediating cell signalling. For these reasons, it is of high importance to have proper understanding of PRR function and possible consequences of its inhibition.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the association between}} myocardial infarction (AMI) and clinical outcome in patients with primary admissions diagnosis of acute cerebral ischemia (ACI) in the US. Methods: Data from Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried from 2002 – 2011 for inpatient admissions of patients with a primary diagnosis of ACI with and without AMI using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification coding (ICD- 9). A multivariate stepwise regression analysis was performed to assess the correlation between identifiable risk factors and clinical outcomes. Results: During 10 years the NIS recorded 886, 094 ACI admissions with 17, 526 diagnoses of AMI (1. 98 %). The overall cumulative mortality of cohort was 5. 65 %. In-hospital mortality was associated with AMI (aOR 3. 68; 95 % CI 3. 49 – 3. 88, p# 0. 0001), rTPA administration (aOR 2. 39 CI, 2. 11 – 2. 71, p, 0. 0001), older age (aOR <b>1.</b> <b>03,</b> 95 % CI, <b>1.</b> <b>03</b> – <b>1.</b> <b>03,</b> P, 0. 0001) and women (aOR 1. 06, 95 % CI <b>1.</b> <b>03</b> – <b>1.</b> 08, P, 0. 0001).

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of penicillin formation through {{the action of}} the enzyme isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) on the substrate &#x 03 B 4 -(L-&#x <b>03</b> B <b>1</b> -aminoadipoyl) -L-cysteinyl-D-valine and synthetic analogues, still raises many unresolved questions, despite many years' extensive investigation. In order to investigate the stereochemistry of formation of the second ring in the product, N-&#x 03 B 4 -(L-&#x <b>03</b> B <b>1</b> -aminoadipoyl) - 3 &#x <b>03</b> B <b>1</b> -hydroxymethylpenicillin, resulting from incubation of &#x 03 B 4 -(L-&#x <b>03</b> B <b>1</b> -aminoadipoyl) - L-cysteinyl-D-vinylglycine with IPNS, the deuterium labelled tripeptides &#x 03 B 4 -(L-&#x <b>03</b> B <b>1</b> -aminoadipoyl) - L-cysteinyl-E-[3, 4 - 2 H 2]-D-vinylglycine and &#x 03 B 4 -(L-&#x <b>03</b> B <b>1</b> -aminoadipoyl) -L-cysteinyl- Z-[3, 4 - 2 H 2]-D-vinylglycine were synthesised and incubated with recombinant IPNS. The pattern of deuterium labelling was retained in the penam products, indicating stereospecific ring closure. The unlabelled and labelled penicillins were converted to their corresponding &#x 03 B 3 -lactones, and the 1 H NMR coupling constants for the C(3) H-C(8) H 2 system used to assign the 8 -Pro/? and 8 -ProS resonances of the unlabelled lactone. Comparison with the labelled lactones indicated that the parent penicillins had been formed via syn addition of sulphur and oxygen across the double bonds of the respective tripeptides. This stereochemistry is consistent with a mechanism involving [2 &#x 03 C 0 s + 2 &#x 03 C 0] cycloaddition of an Fe=O species to the olefln.

40|$|Predictors {{of outcome}} {{following}} whiplash injury {{are limited to}} socio-demographic and symptomatic factors, which are not readily amenable to secondary and tertiary intervention. This prospective study investigated the predictive capacity of early measures of physical and psychological impairment on pain and disability 6 months following whiplash injury. Motor function (ROM; kinaesthetic sense; activity of the superficial neck flexors (EMG) during cranio-cervical flexion), quantitative sensory testing (pressure, thermal pain thresholds, brachial plexus provocation test), sympathetic vasoconstrictor responses and psychological distress (GHQ- 28, TSK, IES) were measured in 76 acute whiplash participants. The outcome measure was Neck Disability Index scores at 6 months. Stepwise regression {{analysis was used to}} predict the final NDI score. Logistic regression analyses predicted membership to one of the three groups based on final NDI scores (30 moderate/severe pain and disability). Higher initial NDI score (1. 007 - 1. 12), older age (<b>1.</b> <b>03</b> - <b>1.</b> 23), cold hyperalgesia (1. 05 - 1. 58), and acute post-traumatic stress (<b>1.</b> <b>03</b> - <b>1.</b> 2) predicted membership to the moderate/severe group. Additional variables associated with higher NDI scores at 6 months on stepwise regression analysis were: ROM loss and diminished sympathetic reactivity. Higher initial NDI score (<b>1.</b> <b>03</b> - <b>1.</b> 28), greater psychological distress (GHQ- 28) (1. 04 - 1. 28) and decreased ROM (<b>1.</b> <b>03</b> - <b>1.</b> 25) predicted subjects with persistent milder symptoms from those who fully recovered. These results demonstrate that both physical and psychological factors play a role in recovery or non-recovery from whiplash injury. This may assist in the development of more relevant treatment methods for acute whiplash. (c) 2004 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{excited state}} {{dynamics}} of isolated sulfur dioxide molecules {{have been investigated}} using the time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and time-resolved photoelectron-photoion coincidence techniques. Excited state wavepackets were prepared in the spectroscopically complex, electronically mixed (B 3 ̆ <b>03)</b> <b>1</b> B 1 /(3) 1 A 2, Clements manifold following broadband excitation at a range of photon energies between 4. 03 eV and 4. 28 eV (308 nm and 290 nm, respectively). The resulting wavepacket dynamics were monitored using a multiphoton ionisation probe. The extensive literature associated with the Clements bands has been summarised and a detailed time domain description of the ultrafast relaxation pathways occurring from the optically bright (B 3 ̆ <b>03)</b> <b>1</b> B 1 diabatic state is presented. Signatures of the oscillatory motion on the (B 3 ̆ <b>03)</b> <b>1</b> B 1 /(3) 1 A 2 lower adiabatic surface responsible for the Clements band structure were observed. The recorded spectra also indicate that {{a component of the}} excited state wavepacket undergoes intersystem crossing from the Clements manifold to the underlying triplet states on a sub-picosecond time scale. Photoelectron signal growth time constants have been predominantly associated with intersystem crossing to the (c 3 ̆ 03) 3 B 2 state and were measured to vary between 750 and 150 fs over the implemented pump photon energy range. Additionally, pump beam intensity studies were performed. These experiments highlighted parallel relaxation processes that occurred at the one- and two-pump-photon levels of excitation on similar time scales, obscuring the Clements band dynamics when high pump beam intensities were implemented. Hence, the Clements band dynamics may be difficult to disentangle from higher order processes when ultrashort laser pulses and less-differential probe techniques are implemented.
