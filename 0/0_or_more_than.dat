40|$|Background: CAM {{has gained}} {{increased}} popularity in Western countries in recent years. Its use is {{commonly associated with}} chronic diseases management and disease prevention. While CAM utilization is becoming more usual, the population-based descriptions of its patterns of use are still lacking; {{little research has been}} devoted to exploring whether the prevalence of CAM and socio-demographic characteristics of CAM users change over time, particularly in Norway. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate changes in the prevalence and socio-demographic characteristics of CAM users in a large adult population in Norway from 2002 to 2012. Methods: Data was obtained from two nationally representative cross-sectional household surveys of the noninstitutionalized civilian populations of Norwegians aged 16 years old and over conducted by Statistics Norway ("Level of living 2002 - Cross sectional study - Health", N= 6827 and "Survey on living conditions, health, care and social contact 2012 ", N= 5660). A multistage stratified probability sampling design to randomly select a representative sample of Norwegian residents was employed in both surveys. Use of CAM was determined by whether the respondents had visited a CAM practitioner during the last 12 months. Binary logistic regression modeling was used to explore whether and what socio-demographic factors predicted CAM use. A test of difference (Ratio Odds Ratio) between the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis for each year for all variables was employed to analyze the changes from 2002 to 2012. Results: In 2002, 8, 7 % (95 % CI: 8, 0 % – 9, 0 %) of the population visited some type of CAM practitioner during the previous year, and this increased significantly (p= 0, 007) to 9, 8 % (95 % CI: 9, 0 % - 11, 0 %) in 2012. The variables which were associated with increased odds of seeing a CAM practitioner from 2002 to 2012 at a 5 % significance level were being 25 - 44 years old (ROR 1, 90), having weight between 56 - 65 kg (ROR 2, <b>0)</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 86 kg (ROR 2, 05). A decrease in the odds of visiting a CAM practitioner was found for non-smokers (ROR 0, 73), and those having visited a chiropractor in the last 12 months (ROR 0, 67). Conclusion: CAM use in the form of visits to CAM practitioners in the last 12 months in the Norwegian population aged 16 years and over has increased significantly between 2002 and 2012. The study did not find any change in possible resorting to CAM services during this time period for females, nor were the social contact group variables regarded as predictive of CAM use in both years and having a consecutive differential change. However, younger people were discovered to be more likely visiting a CAM practitioner in 2012 compared to 2002. These findings indicate apparently a new trend in CAM consumption in Norway that should be studied further...|$|E

40|$|This study {{documents}} {{an investigation}} of how intermetropolitan differences in transit and highway service levels; as well as overall urban development patterns, affect auto ownership and use. Specifically, this paper presents models of the determinants of auto ownership and mode choice for 163, 488 white, single-worker households residing in the largest 125 SMSAs in 1970. Indices of highway capicity, transit service levels, and overall residential density for each SMSA together with each household's socio-economic characteristics, workplace location, and residence choice, are used to explain each household's observed auto ownership status (<b>0,</b> one, <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one car), and, given that auto ownership status, each household's worktrip mode (auto driver, auto passenger, bus, rail, or walk). The models offer a framework for considering the effect of alternative urban development scenarios upon auto ownership and use, and for comparing alternative development and infrastructure policy options. Because the models have been estimated using households from different SMSAs, they are particularly appropriate for investigating changes in spatial structure.

Methods: Salivia samples were collected from 20 breast cancer patients with thick white or yellow tongue fur and 10 healthy controls. The samples were profiled by using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technology coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The analyzed map and data were assessed with Mascott 2. 2 and Scaffold software. Ratio of proteins between groups of less <b>than</b> <b>0.</b> 6 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 1. 5 could confirm that there was difference between groups. Results: A total of 464 proteins were identified and 125 proteins met strict quantitative criteria.

40|$|Background: Cross-sectional {{studies suggest}} an {{association}} between exposure to ambient air pollution and atherosclerosis. We investigated the association between outdoor air quality and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis (common carotid artery intima-media thickness, CIMT). Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined data from five double-blind randomized trials that assessed effects of various treatments on the change in CIMT. The trials were conducted in the Los Angeles area. Spatial models and land-use data were used to estimate the home outdoor mean concentration of particulate matter up to 2. 5 micrometer in diameter (PM 2. 5), and to classify residence by proximity to traffic-related pollution (within 100 m of highways). PM 2. 5 and traffic proximity were positively associated with CIMT progression. Adjusted coefficients were larger than crude associations, not sensitive to modelling specifications, and statistically significant for highway proximity while of borderline significance for PM 2. 5 (P = 0. 08). Annual CIMT progression among those living within 100 m of a highway was accelerated (5. 5 micrometers/ yr [95 %CI: 0. 13 – 10. 79; p = <b>0.</b> 04]) <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> twice the population mean progression.

METHODS A cross-sectional study with a sample defined by convenience, considering the number of gyms registered in the Conselho Regional de Educação Física (Regional Council of Physical Education) of Sao Luis, MA, Northeastern Brazil, from July 2011 to July 2012. The final sample comprised 723 individuals who exercise at gyms. The dependent variable was supplement use, and the explanatory variables were length of time and motivation of the physical exercises, duration, goal and self-perception of training, weekly frequency of gym attendance, sex, age, educational attainment, self-perception of body weight, smoking and self-perception of diet. The association between variables was analysed by hierarchical Poisson regression based on a theoretical model. RESULTS Supplement use was reported by 64. 7 % of the participants. Most of the sample was male (52. 6 %). The most frequent age group was 20 to 39 years (74. 4 %). Most participants (46. 1 %) had been exercising for over a year. The following variables were associated with supplement use: self-perceiving body weight as below ideal (p < 0. 001), smoking (p < 0. 001), exercising for 7 to 12 months (p = <b>0.</b> 028) <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one year (p < 0. 001), spending <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two hours at the gym (p = 0. 051), and perceiving training as moderate (p = <b>0.</b> 024) <b>or</b> intense (p = 0. 001).

AimsWe assessed medical and psychosocial variables of adults with CHD, according to the disease complexity. MethodsWe included, from a single-centre observational cohort study, 135 consecutive adults with CHD (median age of 40 years, interquartile range: 28. 0 – 51. 0) followed in our cardiology unit, who answered a questionnaire assessing daily activity and psychosocial functioning. Disease complexity was classified according to the Bethesda conference. ResultsCardiac malformation complexity was simple in 61 (45. 2 %), moderate in 50 (37. 0 %) and complex in 24 (17. 8 %) patients. Cardiac surgery had been performed in 86. 5 % of moderate and complex patients. Complications (such as heart failure, arrhythmia and pulmonary hypertension) were mainly observed in the complex group (P= 0. 003). Physical activity was lower in the complex group (no activity in 58. 8 %, but sport previously contraindicated in 50 % of these; P= 0. 03). Education level tended to be lower in the complex and moderate groups than in the simple group (respectively, 31. 2 % and 33. 3 % vs. 45. 7 % had passed the Baccalaureate; P= 0. 47). The pass rate was lower in patients with complications (P= <b>0.</b> 037) <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one cardiac surgery (P= 0. 03).

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity is {{associated}} with an inflammatory state that is often characterized by elevated plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Although coffee is broadly consumed in Western societies, {{few studies have examined}} the relationship between obesity, coffee consumption and CRP levels. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the relationship between obesity, coffee consumption and variation in CRP in postmenopausal, overweight/obese women with or without hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses of 344 healthy sedentary, overweight/obese postmenopausal women (mean age= 57. 1 +/- 6. 4 years and mean body mass index (BMI) = 36. 1 +/- 3. 9 kg/ m(2)). Plasma CRP levels were measured by a highly sensitive immunoassay that used monoclonal antibodies coated with polystyrene particles. Diet was assessed using the Food Intake and Analysis System semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Plasma CRP was positively associated with BMI (P < 0. 001) and negatively associated with coffee consumption (P < or= 0. 05). In women using HRT, plasma CRP was positively associated with BMI in women consuming less than one cup of coffee per month (r (2) = 0. 15 (P < 0. 001)), one cup per day (0. 14 (P= 0. 02)) and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one cup per day (0. 12 (P= 0. 03)). In women who did not use HRT, CRP was associated with BMI only in women consuming less than one cup of coffee per day (r (2) = 0. 16 (P < 0. 001)) but not in women consuming one cup per day (0. 06 (P= <b>0.</b> 10)) <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one daily cup of coffee (0. 03 (P= 0. 27)).

Their impact may be greater in women with preexistent thrombophilic defects. Methods: We assessed the effects of COCs on absolute VTE risk in women with single or multiple thrombophilic defects in a retrospective family cohort study. Female relatives of probands with VTE and hereditary deficiencies of protein S, protein C, or antithrombin were tested for known thrombophilic defects, including the index deficiency. Absolute incidences of VTE were compared in deficient vs nondeficient women, in deficient and nondeficient women who ever or never used COCs, and in deficient and nondeficient women with <b>0,</b> 1, <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 1 other thrombophilic defect during exposure to COCs. Results: Of 222 women, 135 (61 %) ever used COCs. Overall, annual incidences of VTE were 1. 64 % and 0. 18 % in deficient and nondeficient women, respectively; the adjusted relative risk was 11. 9 (95 % confidence interval, 3. 9 - 36. 2). The risk was comparable in deficient ever and never users (1. 73 % vs 1. 54 %). Annual incidences during actual COC use were 4. 62 % in deficient women and 0. 48 % in nondeficient women; the relative risk was 9. 7 (95 % confidence interval, 3. 0 - 42. 4). The incidence increased by concomitant thrombophilic defects, from 3. 49 % to 12. 00 % in deficient women and from 0 % to 3. 13 % in nondeficient women. Conclusions: Women with hereditary deficiencies of protein S, protein C, or antithrombin {{are at high risk}} of VTE during use of COCs, particularly when other thrombophilic defects are present.

Methods: Fifty patients (male and 18 - 45 years old) with isolated ACL injury, randomly allocated in two equal groups (in one group, ACL reconstruction was performed with Tibialis Posterior allograft and in another group with quadruple hamstring ligament auto graft) and before and 6 months after surgery in both groups isokinetic flexion strength and isometric internal rotation strength of knee evaluated with Biodex System 4 dynamometer and rotational torque recorder, in order. Isokinetic flexion strength evaluated in sitting and prone position; the later position was performed for deep flexion strength evaluation. Also subjective and objective assessment of all patients pre operatively and 6 months post operatively was documented with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) questionnaire. In this study for first time, rotational torque strength of knee was recorded with new design measure, from isometric aspect and not isokinetic. Results: Although significant improvements in IKDC scores, flexion and internal rotation capacity of the knee were observed in both groups, post operatively in respect to pre operatively; there was no significant difference between 2 groups. (P< <b>0.</b> 05 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 95 % confidence Interval of the difference) Conclusion: This study demonstrates that ACL reconstruction surgery, improves knee performance in flexion and internal rotation, regardless of hamstring tendon harvesting. Considering potential complications of allograft (for example: transfer of harmful diseases from donor to recipient), it is logical to use hamstring auto graft ligament for ACL reconstruction surgery.

The effects of nicotinamide and riboflavin on the sulfur specific activity (SA) of DBT biodesulfurization by R. erythropolis USTB- 03 were investigated. Both nicotinamide and riboflavin were found to enhance the expression of SA, which was not previously reported. When R. erythropolis USTB- 03 was grown on a medium containing nicotinamide of 10. <b>0</b> mmol <b>or</b> riboflavin of 50. 0 mu mol, SA was raised from 68. <b>0</b> <b>or</b> so to <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 130 mmol 2 HBP/(kg dry cells(.) h).

Although studies have found associations between physical activity (PA) and depression, {{little is known about}} the optimal domain, dose and social context of PA for reducing the risk of depression. This study aimed to investigate associations between specific components of PA (domain, dose and social context) and odds of depressive symptoms in women. Methods The sample included 1, 501 women, aged 18 – 65. Analyses were performed using cross-sectional data collected from a mail-out survey in 2004. The survey included self-report measures of PA behaviours and depressive symptoms. Crude and adjusted (age, marital status and physical health) odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each component of PA and odds of depressive symptoms using logistic regression analyses. Results Those who reported <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 3. 5 hours leisure-time PA per week had lower odds of depressive symptoms when compared to those who undertook less than this. No other domains of PA (eg. work-related, transport-related or domestic activity) were associated with odds of depressive symptoms. Odds of depressive symptoms were lower among women who reported <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 1. 5 hours of moderate-intensity (<b>OR</b> = <b>0.</b> 67, CI = 0. 45 – <b>0.</b> 98) <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 1. 75 hours vigorous-intensity (<b>OR</b> = <b>0.</b> 60, CI = 0. 42 – 0. 84) leisure-time PA per week.

The associations of physician supplies with colon cancer stage at diagnosis, receipt of surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, and 5 -year survival were observed within each country and compared between-country. METHODS: Random samples of Ontario and California cancer registries provided 2, 461 and 2, 200 colon cancer cases that were diagnosed between 1996 and 2000, and followed until 2006. Both registries included data {{on the stage of}} disease at the time of diagnosis, receipt of cancer-directed surgery, receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy, and survival. Census tract-level data on low-income prevalence were, respectively, taken from 2001 and 2000 Canadian and United States population censuses. County-level primary care physician and gastroenterologist densities were computed for the same years. RESULTS: Significant income-adjusted, gastroenterologist density threshold effects (2. <b>0</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> vs. less <b>than</b> 2. 0 per 100, 000 inhabitants) were observed for early diagnosis (OR = 1. 57) and 5 -year survival (OR = 1. 63) in Ontario, but not in California.

Using the social-ecological framework, we evaluated individual, social and sexual network, and structural factors and their association with prevalent STIs among Black MSM. The HIV Prevention Trials Network 061 was a multi-site cohort study designed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-component intervention for Black MSM in six US cities. Baseline assessments included demographics, risk behavior, and social and sexual network questions collected information about the size, nature and connectedness of their sexual network. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of having any prevalent sexually transmitted infection (gonorrhea, chlamydia, or syphilis). A total of 1, 553 Black MSM were enrolled in this study. In multivariate analysis, older age (aOR = 0. 57; 95 % CI 0. 49 - 0. 66, p< 0. 001) was associated with a lower odds of having a prevalent STI.

Descriptive analyses of the sample demographic characteristics, smoking status, cigarettes per day, weekly spending money, and frequency of marijuana use were examined by RYO tobacco ever use and RYO tobacco current use. Two logistic regression models were used to examine factors associated with RYO tobacco ever use and RYO tobacco current use. Results We identified that 51. 2 % of current smokers were RYO ever users and 24. 2 % were RYO current users. The prevalence of RYO current users was highest in Atlantic Canada (40. 1 %) and lowest in Quebec (12. 3 %). RYO current users {{were more likely to be}} male (OR 1. 27), to be daily smokers (OR 1. 75), to use marijuana once a month <b>or</b> <b>more</b> (<b>OR</b> 2. 74), and to smoke 11 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> cigarettes per day (OR 6. 52). RYO current users were less likely to be in grade 11 (<b>OR</b> <b>0.</b> 65) <b>or</b> grade 12 (<b>OR</b> <b>0.</b> 40) and less likely to have between $ 20 to $ 100 (<b>OR</b> <b>0.</b> 44) <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> $ 100 (<b>OR</b> <b>0.</b> 45) of disposable income. Conclusions Developing a better understanding of RYO tobacco use among youth is important for advancing population-level tobacco control prevention strategies and cessation programs. We identified that RYO tobacco use is not a negligible problem among Canadian youth. Ongoing research is needed to continue monitoring the prevalence of RYO use among youth and the factors associated with its use, but to also monitor if this more affordable tobacco product is being targeted to price sensitive youth smokers. </p...|$|R

Although 98 orthopedic patients including those receiving total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR), {{were treated with}} 1. 5 mg of Fondaparinux for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Sixteen patients developed DVT, but none were associated with a fatal pulmonary embolism. There was {{a wide range of}} anti-Xa activity, but there were no patients with less <b>than</b> <b>0.</b> 15 mg/L <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>0.</b> 90 mg/L. Anti-Xa activity gradually increased from day 1 to day 8 and showed no significant difference between patients with and without DVT. Anti-Xa activity was correlated with weight, height, body mass index, and antithrombin activity. Postoperative plasma levels of D-dimer and soluble (SF) were markedly high, and those were significantly reduced at day 1 and 4 of treatment with Fondaparinux. Plasma levels of SF were significantly reduced at day 8 and 15, but D-dimer was not. These findings suggested that there was continued thrombin generation after the injection of Fondaparinux until day 8 and secondary fibrinolysis occurred on day 8. In conclusion, 1. 5 mg of Fondaparinux may not be sufficient for the prophylaxis of silent DVT, but it was found to be useful for that of fatal pulmonary embolism. Consequently, monitoring anti-Xa activity may be unnecessary for the administration of Fondaparinux at such doses...|$|R

40|$|Little {{evidence}} is available about survival rates {{in patients with}} recurrent disease after potentially curative surgery for esophageal or junctional cancer. Only in limited occasions, potentially curative salvage strategies are available. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze survival rates and patterns of dissemination, and to identify independent prognostic factors in a consecutive series of patients who develop recurrent esophageal or junctional cancer. Between 1994 and 2015, patients who developed disease recurrence after neoadjuvant chemo(radio) therapy followed by radical esophagectomy for esophageal or junctional cancer were retrospectively analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier estimates were performed to calculate and compare overall survival between patients with different patterns of dissemination and to compare between different treatment strategies. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analyses were performed to identify independent prognostic factors for post recurrence survival. In this study, we included 219 patients. The median overall survival of all included patients was 3. 2 months (range: 0. 0 - 101. 1 months). The median overall survival in patients with exclusively locoregional recurrence (n = 23, 10. 8 %) was 4. 9 months (range: 0. 1 - 55. 6) and 2. 9 months (range: 0. 0 - 101. 1) in patients who had distant metastases (n = 189, 89. 2 %), P = 0. 003. Patients who received treatment aimed at complete tumor eradication (n = 28, 13. 7 %) had a median overall survival of 13. 6 months (range: 1. 1 - 101. 1) and palliative treated patients (n = 94, 46. 1 %) of 4. 7 months (range: 0. 3 - 25. 6), P < 0. 001. In a selected group of patients survival of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 20 months was achieved. Univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analysis showed that a higher age at the diagnosis of recurrent disease (hazard ratio: 1. 087, P <= 0. 001), an irradical resection of the primary tumor (hazard ratio: 3. 355, P = < 0. 001), the number of positive lymph nodes after neoadjuvant therapy (hazard ratios: ypN 2 = 1. 724 (P = 0. 024) and ypN 3 = 2. 082 (P = 0. 028) and the presence of a single hematogenous distant metastases (hazard ratio: 2. 281, P = <b>0.</b> 003) <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one hematogenous distant metastasis (hazard ratio: 2. 385, P = 0. 005) were associated with a shorter postrecurrence survival.

40|$|Objectives The Eastern Cooperative Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) is {{a widely}} used {{standard}} functional classification in oncology practice, the verbal descriptors of which refer to physical activity (PA). Little {{is known about the}} cut-off points of this scale and measured PA levels. This research investigated the relationship between PS assigned, objectively measured PA, and patient age. Materials and Methods One hundred ambulatory patients with treatment-naive cancer wore an accelerometer (RT 3) for a mean (SD) of 5. 6 (1. 1) days before initial oncology evaluation and ECOG PS assignment. Results Seventy five participants (75 %) were < 65 years and 25 were ? 65 years. Eighty nine (89 %) were assigned an ECOG PS of <b>0</b> <b>or</b> 1 and 11 % a PS of 2 or 3. A weak but significant inverse association was found between objectively measured PA and PS (rho = ? 0. 26, p = 0. 01). Seventy one participants (80 %) with a PS of <b>0</b> <b>or</b> 1 spent <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50 % of waking hours resting. Participants assigned a PS of 2 ? 3 spent significantly <b>more</b> time resting <b>than</b> those assigned a PS of 0 (p = 0. 01). Age ? 65 years was significantly related to PS assigned (p = 0. 04), although the older cohort were no less sedentary than younger patients. Conclusion PA levels were low, but PS scoring reflected relative PA levels and differentiated between patients of PS 0 and 2 ? 3. Chronological age was not predictive of activity levels, but older patients were assigned lower PS scores.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 157 Chinese patients (pts) presented with NSCLC received 3 DCRT: alone (34 pts) or combined with sequential CT (59 pts) (group 1) or with concomitant CT (64 pts) (group 2). Parameters (TD(50), n, and m) of the LKB NTCP model predicting for>grade 2 AE (RTOG grading) were identified using maximum likelihood analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses using a binary regression logistic model {{were performed to}} identify patient, tumor and dosimetric predictors of AE. RESULTS: Grade 2 or 3 AE occurred in 24 % and 52 % of pts in group 1 and 2, respectively (p< 0. 001). For the 93 group 1 pts, the fitted LKB model parameters were: m= 0. 15, n= 0. 29 and TD(50) = 46 Gy. For the 64 group 2 pts, the parameters were: m= 0. 42, n= 0. 09 and TD(50) = 36 Gy. In multivariate analysis, the only significant predictors of AE were: NTCP (p< 0. 001) and V(50), as continuous variable (RR= 1. 03, p= <b>0.</b> 03) <b>or</b> being <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a threshold value of 11 % (RR= 3. 6, p= 0. 009).

40|$|Introduction:Small cell {{lung cancer}} (SCLC) is {{initially}} a chemotherapy-sensitive disease. Nevertheless, drug-resistance results in disease recurrence in most patients. Many drugs, including antimetabolites, are active, but only minimal {{progress has been}} made in improving survival times for those with advanced disease. Based on the need to discover better systemic therapies, we conducted a phase II study of pemetrexed in patients with relapsed SCLC. Patients and Methods:Eligible patients had SCLC or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine cancers of the lung, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, and had received less than or equal to two prior chemotherapy regimens (additional targeted agents were allowed). Both chemotherapy-sensitive (relapse ≥ 90 days from completion of first line therapy) and chemotherapy-resistant (progressive disease during or within 90 days from completion of first line treatment) patients were eligible and analyzed separately. Pemetrexed was administered at 500 mg/m 2 intravenously every 21 days for up to six cycles. All patients received folic acid, vitamin B 12, and steroid prophylaxis. The primary objective of the trial was to estimate the clinical benefit rate (complete plus partial response plus stable disease) in each group. Results:From January 2005 to September 2005, 20 patients were enrolled in the chemotherapy-sensitive arm and 23 patients in the chemotherapy-resistant arm. The majority of patients were men, the median age of the two groups were 62. 5 and 65, respectively; 75 % had a performance status of <b>0</b> <b>or</b> 1, and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50 % had received <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one prior regimen. Grade 3 / 4 toxicities were as expected for pemetrexed. Progressive disease was the best response in 16 patients (80 %) in the chemo-sensitive group and 19 patients (83 %) in the chemo-refractory group. One patient had a partial response and three had stable disease in each group. Conclusion:Pemetrexed has minimal single agent activity in relapsed SCLC...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cervical {{cancer is}} the most common cancer among women in Botswana and {{elsewhere}} in Sub-Saharan Africa. We sought to examine whether HPV vaccine is acceptable among parents in Botswana, which recently licensed the vaccine to prevent cervical cancer. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 2009, around the time the vaccine was first licensed, with adults recruited in general medicine and HIV clinics in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana. Although only 9 % (32 / 376) of respondents had heard of HPV vaccine prior to the survey, 88 % (329 / 376) said they definitely will have their adolescent daughters receive HPV vaccine. Most respondents would get the vaccine for their daughters at a public or community clinic (42 %) or a gynecology or obstetrician's office (39 %), and 74 % would get it for a daughter if it were available at her school. Respondents were more likely to say that they definitely will get HPV vaccine for their daughters if they had less education (<b>OR</b> =  <b>0.</b> 20, 95 % CI =  0. 07 - <b>0.</b> 58) <b>or</b> lived <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 30 kilometers from the capital, Gaborone (OR =  2. 29, 95 % CI =  1. 06 - 4. 93). Other correlates of acceptability were expecting {{to be involved in the}} decision to get HPV vaccine, thinking the vaccine would be hard to obtain, and perceiving greater severity of HPV-related diseases. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination of adolescent girls would be highly acceptable if the vaccine became widely available to the daughters of healthcare seeking parents in Gaborone, Botswana. Potential HPV vaccination campaigns should provide more information about HPV and the vaccine as well as work to minimize barriers...|$|R
40|$|Background: Worldwide {{cervical}} cancer {{is one of}} the more common forms of carcinoma among women, causing high morbidity and high mortality. Despite being a major health problem in Tanzania, screening services for {{cervical cancer}} are very limited, and uptake of those services is low. We therefore conducted a study to investigate utilization of cancer screening services, and its associated factors among female primary school teachers in Ilala Municipality, Dar es Salaam. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study between May – August 2011 which involved 110 primary schools in Ilala Municipality in Dar es Salaam. Five hundred and twelve female primary school teachers were sampled using a two-stage cluster sampling procedure. Data on utilization of cervical cancer and risk factors were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Proportional utilization of cervical cancer screening services was identified through a self report. Risk factors for services utilization were assessed using logistic regression analyses. Results: Out of 512 female primary school teachers, only 108 (21 %) reported to ever been screened for cervical cancer. Utilization of cervical cancer screening services was 28 % among those aged 20 – 29, 22 % among married and 24 % among those with higher level of education. Women were more likely to utilize the cancer-screening service if they were multiparous (age-adjusted OR = 3. 05, 95 % CI 1. 15 – 8. 06, P value <b>0.</b> 025), <b>or</b> reported <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one lifetime sexual partner (age-adjusted OR 2. 17, 95 % CI 1. 04 – 4. 54, P value <b>0.</b> 038), <b>or</b> did not involve their spouse in making health decisions (adjusted OR 3. 56, 95 % CI 2. 05 – 6. 18, P value < 0. 001). Conclusion: The study has demonstrated low level of utilization of cervical cancer screening service among female primary school teachers in Ilala munipality. Female primary school teachers with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one previous pregnancy and those with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one life-time sex partners were more likely to report utilization of the service.

Patients referred to our department for (18) F-FDG PET/CT for staging of HNSCC were prospectively included between February 2009 and March 2011. Each patient was scanned using a Philips Gemini PET/CT system at 1 h after injection. The MTV was calculated semiautomatically for the primary site using methods based on SUV with various thresholds: 3 -D contour around voxels equal to or greater than 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0, 3. 5, 4. 0, 4. 5, 5. 0, 5. 5, 6. 0, 6. 5 and 7. <b>0</b> times SUV, <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 30 %, 40 % and 50 % of SUVmax. ROC analysis was used to test the statistical significance of the differences among the calculated MTVs. EFS and OS were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with MTV in univariate and multivariate analyses, including the usual prognostic factors: age, sex, primary site, treatment, SCC histologic grade, AJCC stage, TNM classification, tumour SUVmax and SUVpeak. The study included 80 consecutive patients (70 men, 10 women; mean age 62. 4 ± 9. 0 years). ROC analysis revealed that pretreatment MTV using a threshold of 5. 0 times SUV (MTV 5. 0) was the best parameter to predict recurrence and death after treatment. In univariate analysis, MTV 5. 0 > 4. 9 ml was predictive of poor EFS (p < 0. 0001) and poor OS (p < 0. 0001). In multivariate, MTV 5. 0 persisted as an independent predictive factor for EFS (p = 0. 011) and OS (p = 0. 010), while SUVmax became nonsignificant (p = 0. 277 for EFS, p = 0. 975 for OS). Our results suggest that MTV measured by (18) F-FDG PET/CT has independent prognostic value of in patients with HNSCC, stronger than SUVmax...|$|R

MethodsPatients were randomized to receive either 1. 5 L <b>or</b> 2. <b>0</b> L fill volumes using a 1. 5 % dextrose solution, with the dialysate allowed to dwell for 2 hours. Patients were then asked to answer a questionnaire to determine if they experienced any discomfort during the dwell period. Symptoms were also analyzed using a score of one point for every type of discomfort experienced by the patient and 0 if the symptom was absent. The number of patients in each group who had no discomfort symptoms, discomfort symptom scores between <b>0</b> and 5, <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> five discomfort symptoms was determined. ResultsSixty patients were enrolled in the study, with 30 patients in each treatment group. The study groups were comparable in age, sex, primary renal disease, body surface area, height, and weight. They differed in duration on CAPD before administration of the test. Patients in the 1. 5 L group were on CAPD for a shorter period (median, 5 days) than those in the 2. 0 L group (median, 92 days; p = 0. 00, Mann-Whitney test). Fourteen patients (46. 7 %) in the 1. 5 L group and 11 patients (36. 7 %) in the 2. 0 L group experienced discomfort symptoms. Only three patients (10. 0 %) in each of the two study groups experienced abdominal pain. Patients were asked to answer a clinical assessment questionnaire on what type of discomfort they experienced during dwell time. The proportions of patients with difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, and difficulty sitting were significantly higher among those in the 1. 5 L group than the 2. 0 L group. Logistic regression analysis to control for the effect of the time interval in order to {{determine whether}} there was any difference between the groups in the discomfort experienced showed that there was no significant difference. There was also no significant difference in symptom score between the two groups. ConclusionThere was no increase in abdominal discomfort when patients used the 2. 0 L dialysis fluid bag compared to the 1. 5 L bag. The hesitancy of patients to use larger volume exchange may be due to patient bias rather than abdominal discomfort. [Hong Kong J Nephrol 2003; 5 (2) : 84 - 9...|$|R
40|$|Electrically active point {{defects in}} {{semiconductor}} materials {{are important because}} they strongly affect material properties like effective doping concentration and charge carrier lifetimes. This thesis presents results on point defects introduced by ion implantation in silicon and silicon carbide. The defects have mainly been studied by deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) which is a quantitative, electrical characterization method highly suitable for point defect studies. The method is based on measurements of capacitance transients and both standard DLTS and new applications of the technique have been used. In silicon, a fundamental understanding of diffusion phenomena, like room-temperature migration of point defects and transient enhanced diffusion (TED), is still incomplete. This thesis presents new results which brings this understanding a step closer. In the implantation-based experimental method used to measure point defect migration at room temperature, it {{has been difficult to}} separate the effects of defect migration and ion channeling. For various reasons, the effect of channeling has so far been disregarded in this type of experiments. Here, a very simple method to assess the amount of channeling is presented, and it is shown that channeling dominates in our experiments. It is therefore recommended that this simple test for channeling is included in all such experiments. This thesis also contains a detailed experimental study on the defect distributions of vacancy and interstitial related damage in ion implanted silicon. Experiments show that interstitial related damage is positioned deeper (<b>0.</b> 4 um <b>or</b> <b>more)</b> <b>than</b> vacancy related damage. A physical model to explain this is presented. This study is important to the future modeling of transient enhanced diffusion. Furthermore, the point defect evolution in low-fluence implanted 4 H-SiC is investigated, and a large number of new defect levels has been observed. Many of these levels change or anneal out at temperatures below 300 C, which is not in accordance with the general belief that point defect diffusion in SiC requires high temperatures. This thesis also includes an extensive study on a metastable defect which we have observed {{for the first time and}} labeled the M-center. The defect is characterized with respect to DLTS signatures, reconfiguration barriers, kinetics and temperature interval for annealing, carrier capture cross sections, and charge state identification. A detailed configuration diagram for the M-center is presented. QC 2010102...|$|R
40|$|The {{information}} about the chemical compositions of stars is encoded in their spectra. Accurate determinations of these compositions are crucial for our understanding of stellar nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution. The determination of elemental abundances in stars requires models for the stellar atmospheres and the processes of line formation. Nearly all spectroscopic analyses of late-type stars carried out today are based on one-dimensional (1 D), hydrostatic model atmospheres and on the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). This approach can lead to large systematic errors in the predicted stellar atmospheric structures and line-strengths, and, hence, in the derived stellar abundances. In this thesis, examples of departures from LTE and from hydrostatic equilibrium are explored. The effects of background line opacities (line-blocking) due to atomic lines on the statistical equilibrium of Fe are investigated in late-type stars. Accounting for this line opacity is important at solar metallicity, where line-blocking significantly reduces the rates of radiatively induced ionizations of Fe. On the contrary, the effects of line-blocking in metal-poor stars are insignificant. In metal-poor stars, the dominant uncertainty in the statistical equilibrium of Fe is the treatment of inelastic H+Fe collisions. Substantial departures of Fe abundances from LTE are found at low metallicities: about 0. 3 dex with efficient H+Fe collisions and about 0. 5 dex without. The impact of three-dimensional (3 D) hydrodynamical model atmospheres on line formation in red giant stars is also investigated. Inhomogeneities and correlated velocity fields in 3 D models and differences between the mean 3 D stratifications and corresponding 1 D model atmospheres can significantly affect the predicted line strengths and derived abundances, in particular at very low metallicities. In LTE, the differences between 3 D and 1 D abundances of C, N, and O derived from CH, NH, and OH weak low-excitation lines {{are in the range}} - 0. 5 dex to - 1. 0 dex at [Fe/H]=- 3. Large negative corrections (about - 0. 8 dex) are also found in LTE for weak low-excitation neutral Fe lines. We also investigate the impact of 3 D hydrodynamical model stellar atmospheres on the determination of elemental abundances in the carbon-rich, hyper iron-poor stars HE 0107 - 5240 and HE 1327 - 2326. The lower temperatures of the line-forming regions of the 3 D models compared with 1 D models cause changes in the predicted spectral line strengths. In particular we find the 3 D abundances of C, N, and O to be lower by about - <b>0.</b> 8 dex (<b>or</b> <b>more)</b> <b>than</b> estimated from a 1 D analysis. The 3 D abundance of Fe is decreased but only by - 0. 2 dex. Departures from LTE for Fe might actually be very large for these stars and dominate over the effects due to granulation...|$|R
