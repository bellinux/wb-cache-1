Three different thicknesses of the alloy sheet, namely 1, 1. 85, and 3. 6 mm, corresponding to different textures were investigated. Tensile tests were carried out at 0 Â°, 45 Â° and 90 Â° with respect to sheet rolling direction and the resulting in-plane anisotropy in <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> <b>proof</b> <b>stress,</b> work hardening and plastic strain ratio (r-value) were determined. Texture derived r-values are also calculated and discussed vis-Ã -vis the experimentally obtained r-values. Finally the formability of the optimal alloy was studied using forming limit diagrams. Effect of natural aging, with a simulated heat treatment of 70 Â°C for 2 h on FLD was studied and compared with the as solutionized samples. It was observed that, the strain levels in the bi-axial region of the FLD were not much affected by the heat treatment. Â© 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{building}} industry {{has a particular}} interest in using clinching as a joining method for frame constructions of light-frame housing. Normally many clinch joints are required in joining of frames. In order to maximise {{the strength of the}} complete assembly, each clinch joint must be as sound as possible. Experimental testing is the main means of optimising a particular clinch joint. This includes shear strength testing and visual observation of joint cross-sections. The manufacturers of clinching equipment normally perform such experimental trials. Finite element analysis {{can also be used to}} optimise the tool geometry and the process parameter, X, which represents the thickness of the base of the joint. However, such procedures require dedicated software, a skilled operator, and test specimens in order to verify the finite element model. In addition, when using current technology several hours' computing time may be necessary. The objective of the study was to develop a simple calculation procedure for rapidly establishing an optimum value for the parameter X for a given tool combination. It should be possible to use the procedure on a daily basis, without stringent demands on the skill of the operator or the equipment. It is also desirable that the procedure would significantly decrease thenumber of shear strength tests required for verification. The experimental workinvolved tests in order to obtain an understanding of the behaviour of the sheets during clinching. The most notable observation concerned the stage of the process in which the upper sheet was initially bent, after which the deformation mechanism changed to shearing and elongation. The amount of deformation was measured relative to the original location of the upper sheet, and characterised as the C-measure. By understanding in detail the behaviour of the upper sheet, it waspossible to estimate a bending line function for the surface of the upper sheet. A procedure was developed, which makes it possible to estimate the process parameter X for each tool combination with a fixed die. The procedure is based on equating the volume of material on the punch side with the volume of the die. Detailed information concerning the behaviour of material on the punch side is required, assuming that the volume of die does not change during the process. The procedure was applied to shear strength testing of a sample material. The sample material was continuously hot-dip zinc-coated high-strength constructional steel,with a nominal thickness of 1. 0 mm. The minimum Rp <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> was 637 N/mm 2. Such material has not yet been used extensively in light-frame housing, and little has been published on clinching of the material. The performance of the material is therefore of particular interest. Companies that use clinching on a daily basis stand to gain the greatest benefit from the procedure. By understanding the behaviour of sheets in different cases, it is possible to use data at an early stage for adjusting and optimising the process. In particular, the functionality of common tools can be increased since it is possible to characterise the complete range of existing tools. The study increases and broadens the amount ofbasic information concerning the clinching process. New approaches and points of view are presented and used for generating new knowledge...|$|E

Both thermal cycling and isothermal exposure reduced <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % <b>proof</b> <b>stress,</b> tensile strength and micro Vickers hardness to one third through a half of those of the original SiCp/Al 6061 composites and mainly due to the softening of the matrix. In addition, the thermal cycling caused interfacial debonding between coarse particles and matrix in the SiCp/Al, which was confirmed from the observation of fracture morphology. The reduction in <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and tensile strength increased with increasing SiC particle volume fraction.

40|$|The {{magnitude}} {{and distribution of}} residual stresses in structural carbon steel sections have been thoroughly investigated. However, few residual stress measurements have been made on structural stainless steel sections. Stainless steel has differing material stress-strain characteristics and thermal properties to carbon steel, both of which influence the formation of residual stresses. This suggests that established carbon steel residual stress models may not be appropriate for stainless steel. With increased use of stainless steel in load bearing applications, {{it is important to}} establish the residual stresses that exist within structural members. An experimental program to quantify the residual stresses in stainless steel sections from three different production routes has therefore been carried out. Comprehensive residual stress distributions have been obtained for three hot rolled angles, eight press braked angles and seven cold rolled box sections, with a total of over 800 readings taken. This paper presents the experimental techniques implemented and the residual stress distributions obtained as well as discussing the assumptions commonly made regarding through thickness residual stress variations.

40|$|Creep {{tests of}} the {{polycrystalline}} nickel alloy Waspaloy have been conducted at Swansea University, for varying stress conditions at 700 [*]∘C. Investigation through use of Transmission Electron Microscopy at Cambridge University has examined the dislocation networks formed under these conditions, notably those with stresses {{above and below the}} yield stress. This paper highlights how the dislocation structures vary throughout creep and proposes a dislocation mechanism theory for creep in Waspaloy. In particular, the roles of recovery, tertiary gamma prime particles and dislocation foresting are examined, and related back to observations from the Wilshire fits. The virgin (untested) material has been forged and heat treated, containing some recrystallised material together with areas of more heavily deformed and recovered material clustered around the grain boundaries. Observations from tests below the <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> show relatively low dislocation densities away from grain boundaries and dislocation movement can be seen to be governed by interactions with the γ′ precipitates. In contrast, above the <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % <b>proof</b> <b>stress,</b> TEM observations show a substantially greater density of dislocations. The increased density provides an increment of strength through forest hardening. At stresses above the original yield point, determined by the precipitates, the creep rate is controlled by inter-action with the dislocation forest and results in an apparent activation energy change. It is proposed that the activation energy change is related to the stress increment provided by work hardening, as can be observed from Ti, Ni and steel results...|$|R

After 95 pct CR, the average high-angle grain boundary spacing reduces to 0. 14 μm, whereas the high-angle boundary fraction increases to ~ 81 pct. The ECAP negative simple shear texture components rotate by ~ 15 deg around the transverse direction toward the rolling direction for up to 50 pct CR, with typical rolling textures observed at 95 pct CR. The decrease in boundary spacing produces a ~ 500 MPa gain in <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> pct <b>proof</b> <b>stress,</b> a ~ 600 MPa increase in ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and a ~ 4 pct loss in total elongation after 95 pct CR.

The fracture mode of the tensile samples changes from ductile to brittle type between ECAP and 95 pct CR and is attributed to the reduced work hardening capacity of the latter.

Many such structures are still in use today {{and it is important}} that they fulfil the current requirements of fire resistance when there is a change of use. These structures are out of scope of modern design codes and old design codes do not provide guidance for fire resistance design. Furthermore, cast iron is a brittle material weak in tension, and there are many uncertainties in its mechanical properties at ambient and elevated temperatures due to material flaws. It is necessary to quantify the probability of structural failure and to introduce safety factors to reduce the probability of structural failure in fire to an acceptable level. This paper presents the results of a detailed study whose purpose is to derive appropriate safety factors to achieve different levels of reliability, for fire safety design of cast iron beams.

In case of the composite reinforced with 18 % SiC particles, although the elastic modulus increases the <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and compressive strength were only marginally higher than the unreinforced alloy and lower than those of Al–Li– 8 %SiC and Al–Li– 12 %SiC composites. Clustering of SiC particles appears to be responsible for reduced the strength of Al–Li– 18 %SiC composite. The fracture surface of unreinforced 8090 Al-Li alloy (8090 Al) shows a dimpled structure, indicating ductile mode of failure. Fracture in composites occurs by a mixed mode, giving rise to a bimodal distribution of dimples in the fracture surface. Cleavage of SiC particles was also observed in the fracture surface of composites. Composites show higher peak hardness and lower peak ageing time compared with unreinforced 8090 Al alloy. Macro- and microhardness increase significantly after peak ageing. Ageing also results in considerable improvement in strength of the unreinforced 8090 Al alloy and its composites. This is attributed to formation of δ' (Al 3 Li) and S' (Al 2 CuMg) precipitates during ageing. Per cent elongation, however, decreases due to age hardening. Al–Li– 12 %SiC, which shows marginally lower UTS and compressive strength than the Al–Li– 8 %SiC composite in extruded condition, exhibits higher strength than Al–Li– 8 %SiC in peak-aged condition...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of newly-designed Zn-xSn (x 40, 30, and 20 mass%) and Zn- 30 mass%In alloys as high temperature lead-free solders was evaluated, with particular {{focus on the}} fundamental thermal properties and phase stability during thermal and humidity exposure. From DSC results, the melting temperature of Zn-Sn alloys increased with decreasing Sn content, and the final undercooling was about 3 C. The liquid fraction of the alloys calculated using Scheil’s model is {{lower than that of}} the alloys calculated according to the phase diagram by approximately 10 mass % at the eutectic temperature and 250 C. The coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of Zn-Sn alloys increased with decreasing Sn content, i. e. 29 : 2 106 K 1 to 33 : 2 106 K 1 in the temperature range of 50 C to 200 C for Zn-Sn alloys and 31 : 3 106 K 1 in the temperature range of 50 C to 140 C for Zn- 30 In alloy. With increasing temperature above eutectic temperature, all alloys began to deform, indicating the formation of a liquid phase. The thermal deformation of Zn-Sn alloys decreased with increasing Sn content. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> of the as-cast Zn-Sn alloys were almost the same, but the elongation of the as-cast Zn-Sn alloys decreased with increasing Sn content. After thermal and humidity exposure for 1000 h (85 C/ 85 % Relative Humidity), only the outer surface of Zn-Sn alloys oxidized. However, Zn- 30 In alloy rusted quite seriously resulting in Zn oxidation after 1000 h. The UTS and <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> of Zn-Sn alloy slightly decreased with increasing exposure time. The elongation of Zn-Sn alloys decreased with decreasing Sn content for 100 h exposure. However, the elongation of Zn-Sn alloys showed no further degradation beyond 100 h exposure...|$|R

In this paper, the nominal <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> of the high-strength steel was 700, 900, and 1, 100 MPa. A total of 25 stub column tests on circular, rectangular, and square hollow structural sections were conducted. Geometric imperfections and load-deformation histories were reported and assessed. The experimental results were compared against the design values {{calculated from the}} Australian, European, and North American codes, and the corresponding compactness criteria were assessed. A finite-element model, which incorporated the varying material properties, was described, {{and the influence of}} geometric and material imperfections was also evaluated. The finite-element results successfully captured the experimental observations and can be adopted for future parametric studies. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{limit of}} {{dislocation}} density was investigated {{by means of}} mechanical milling (MM) treatment of an iron powder. Mechanical milling enabled an ultimate severe deformation of iron powder particles and dislocation density in the MM iron powder showed the clear saturation at around the value of 1016 m- 2. On the other hand, the relation between hardness and dislocation density was examined in cold-rolled iron sheets, and the linear Bailey-Hirsch relationship; HV[GPa]= 0. 7 + 3 × 10 - 8 ρ 1 / 2 was obtained in the dislocation density region up to 3 × 1015 m- 2. Extrapolation of the Bailey-Hirsch relationship indicated that the dislocation strengthening {{should be limited to}} about 3. 7 GPa in Vickers hardness which corresponds to about 1. 1 GPa in <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % <b>proof</b> <b>stress...</b>|$|R

To this aim, the <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and the tensile strength of as-welded and post-weld treated joints as function of the rotating and welding speed was analyzed performing a complete factorial design with three levels for each studied parameter. Statistical analyses were carried out to establish empirical models of the tensile prop-erties of the joints {{as a function of}} the studied welding parameters. The obtained models were validated through statistical tools such as Mallow's CP, S, & R 2 and R 2 (adj). The developed regression models can be effectively used to predict the mechanical proprieties of the joints at 95 % confidence level...|$|R

From results of bending and recovery test with heating, Ti-Sc-Mo alloys were found to have superior shape memory effect. The optimum composition for the shape memory effect was Ti- 4. 0 to 6. 0 Sc- 6. 0 Mo alloys. The maximum shape recovery strain in the Ti- 5. 0 Sc- 6. 0 Mo alloy was 5. 3 % measured through cyclic tensile deformation. Vickers hardness and <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> were remarkably decreased and elongation was increased with Sc content. The marked grain refining was also achieved. The relationship between microstructure and mechanical properties was briefly discussed. Microstructure observations and XRD measurements before and after tensile deformation showed that the shape memory effect was associated with the stress induced to 00 transformation...|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} impeller mixing {{coupled with}} chill casting technique {{was used for}} the preparation of Al-Fe composite. The electrolytic grade iron powder of 300 mesh size was dispersed in the melt of commercially pure aluminum. The iron content in the composite varied from 1. 67 to 11. 2 wt%. The presence of iron in the composite improved the ultimate tensile strength, <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and the hardness. The ductility showed the adverse effect with increase of the iron content in the matrix. The results from microstructure showed the presence of second phase particles at the grain boundaries of aluminum-rich phase as well as within the grain itself which was confirmed by EPMA line as well as XRD analysis. These composite have also been subjected to wear and friction testing at different operating parameters. The XRD analysis was used to analyze the wear debris...|$|R
40|$|The {{modified}} austempering {{was applied}} on the ductile cast iron(DCI) to enhance its mechanical properties. This treatment named ansquenching consists of short time austempering, direct water quenching and light tempering. In this combined heat treatment, the first austempering process takes much {{effect on the}} tensile property and toughness of ausquenched DCI(AQDI). AQDI shows higher <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % <b>proof</b> <b>stress,</b> tensile strength and fracture toughness than the austempered DCI(ADI) at the temperature range of upper bainite. AQDI has a complex structure of bainitic-ferrite, light tempered martensite and retained austenite. For the purpose of quantitative evaluation on the compound matrix of the martensite and the bainitic-ferrite, the X-ray diffraction profiles of α-Fe were analyzed by the curve fitting technique using Pseudo-Voight function.

The material properties of high strength cold-formed lean duplex stainless steel square and rectangular hollow sections were examined. Tensile coupons and stub columns were tested for steel for six different sections. TheYoung’s moduli, <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % <b>proof</b> <b>stresses,</b> tensile strengths, {{elongation at fracture}} and the Ramberg-Osgood parameter of lean duplex stainless steel material were measured. The initial local geometric imperfections of the six sections were measured. Residual stresses were measured using the method of sectioning. The membrane and bending residual stress distributions in the cross-section were obtained and plotted. The stub column test strengths obtained from this studyand the available data were also compared with the design strengths predicted by the American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and European Code for stainless steel structures. Generally, the three specifications conservatively predicted the column strengths...|$|R
