40|$|An {{effort is}} made to clarify the effect of leading-edge sweep on the vortex <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> leading-edge vortex {{strength}} of a slender wing; while it is often assumed that increasing sweep enhances vortex <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> strength, the opposite is the case. The suction analogy is used in association with numerical and experimental data to derive simple formulas yielding the actual relationship for delta wings.
