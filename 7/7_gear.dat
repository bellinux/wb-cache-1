25|$|The {{combination}} of 3 chainrings and an 8-sprocket cogset does {{not result in}} 24 usable gear ratios. Instead it provides 3 overlapping ranges of 7, 8, and <b>7</b> <b>gear</b> ratios. The outer ranges only have 7 ratios rather than 8 because the extreme combinations (largest chainring to largest rear sprocket, smallest chainring to smallest rear sprocket) result in a very diagonal chain alignment which is inefficient and causes excessive chain wear. Due to the overlap, there will usually be some duplicates or near-duplicates, so that there might only be 16 or 18 distinct gear ratios. It may not be feasible to use these distinct ratios in strict low-high sequence anyway due to the complicated shifting patterns involved (e.g. simultaneous double or triple shift on the rear derailleur and a single shift on the front derailleur). In the worst case there could be only 10 distinct gear ratios, if the percentage step between chainrings {{is the same as}} the percentage step between sprockets. However, if the most popular ratio is duplicated then it may be feasible to extend the life of the gear set by using different versions of this popular ratio.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{proportional}} modification {{parameters are}} useful for compensating the tooth form errors of spiral bevel gears. Based on the mathematical model for calculating the machine setting parameters {{and according to the}} relative position relationship between cutter and workpiece, the formulae for calculating the second-order proportional modification parameters for gears manufactured by spread blade method was deduced by the curvature and normal vector at calculation point. The proportional modification parameters can make the lengthwise curvature or profile curvature or lengthwise twist curvature of the concave and convex flank produce uniform change or difference change. The formulae is verified by experiment on CNC spiral bevel gear grinding machine and M&M sigma <b>7</b> <b>gear</b> measuring center. Preface In order to ensure the transmission quality and realize interchangeability of spiral bevel gears, the practical tooth form should be equal to the theoretical tooth form approximately. The method listed in literature [1 - 8] for modifying tooth form errors is not effectual for gears manufactured by spread blade method. Literature [9] puts forward a new modification method based on proportional modification parameters and it can realize the modification of tooth form errors of the pinion generated by single side method. This method is also available for gears generated by spread blade method. However, the current machine settings summary only provides the proportional modification parameters for pinion. Consequently, in order to apply this modification method to modify the tooth form errors of gears generated by spread blade method, this paper will deduce the formulae for calculating the second-order proportional modification parameters based on mathematical model for calculating machine setting parameters and verify these formulae by experiment...|$|E

40|$|Genome {{sequencing}} {{has yielded}} unparalleled insights into fundamental biological processes and the genetics that guide them. In contrast to expectations that protein-coding genes {{would be the}} primary output of eukaryotic genomes, however, {{it is now clear}} that the vast majority of transcription is devoted to noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Although originally regarded as 2 ̆ 7 transcriptional noise 2 ̆ 7, {{it is now clear that}} these transcripts are essential regulators of genetic activity. In this thesis I build upon the hypothesis that the genomes of eukaryotes encode a regulatory 2 ̆ 7 RNA machine 2 ̆ 7 dominated by ncRNAs. In the Introduction (Chapter 1) I discuss how prior gene models may have inadvertently prevented a full understanding of ncRNAs, review the transcriptional landscape of eukaryotes, and examine the biogenesis and function of small regulatory RNAs. In support of a role for ncRNAs in complex metazoa, Chapter 2 presents data showing a positive correlation between the proportion of non-protein-coding DNA and biological complexity, suggesting that the evolutionary trajectory of intricate developmental phenotypes may have been facilitated by ncRNAs. In the following chapters two more 2 ̆ <b>7</b> <b>gears</b> 2 ̆ <b>7</b> are added to the RNA machine. Chapter 3 details the discovery of snoRNA-derived RNAs - an evolutionarily ancient class of Argonaute-assocaited RNA whose biogenesis overlaps with microRNAs (miRNAs) and silencing RNAs (siRNAs). Likewise, Chapter 4 reports a new class of 18 nt transcription initiation RNAs (tiRNAs) derived from regions proximal to transcription start sites. tiRNAs are enriched at GC-rich promoters and regions of active transcription, implicating them in transcriptional regulation. Chapter 5 presents evidence that tiRNAs are restricted to metazoa, and describes a model of RNA Polymerase II dependent tiRNA biogenesis. This thesis concludes with a general discussion of the implications of these findings, and the potential development of RNA therapeutics. Gathering evidence suggests that eukaryotic genomes are driven by a complex and interwoven network of RNA regulatory feedback loops. This thesis takes a small step towards developing a complete picture of this system...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{long history}} of work in systems {{thinking}} and operational research (henceforth referred to as 2 ̆ 7 systems/OR 2 ̆ <b>7)</b> <b>geared</b> to facilitating organizational change and/or wider social improvement. Recently, however, the 2 ̆ 7 improvement 2 ̆ 7 agenda has been subject to a sustained critique from people who take an explicitly postmodern stance. This paper presents five 2 ̆ 7 sketches 2 ̆ 7 of postmodernism, and draws out some implications for systems/OR. The first sketch is of a dogmatic postmodernism that places conversation at the forefront of its agenda, but fails to enter into a conversation itself. It therefore collapses under the weight of a contradiction between its theory and practice. The second is of a more open postmodernism that is prepared to recognize its own status as a conversational device, and thereby its own transitory nature. This suggests the need for the systems/OR community to act as participants in debate, continually developing their own and others 2 ̆ 7 views. The third sketch focuses on the central contradiction of a postmodern meta-narrative condemning all meta-narratives but its own. This raises some interesting issues, {{not the least of which}} is the realization that the term 2 ̆ 7 meta-narrative 2 ̆ 7 is usually used pejoratively. We may therefore need to moderate the use of such language to facilitate productive debates on key issues of concern for the future of systems/OR. The fourth sketch looks at the irony of inevitable contradictions in postmodern theory, and the consequent move away from the notion that the role of rationality is to harmonize ideas. Several possible consequences for systems/OR are identified: further rational (harmonizing) explanations of 2 ̆ 7 inevitable contradictions 2 ̆ 7 in postmodern theory may be provoked, or the shift away from a traditional notion of rationality may liberate systems/OR from a relatively narrow range of analytical methods. The fifth and final sketch examines the political con-sequences of postmodernism as expressed in liberalism. A [...] . [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{earliest}} form of {{a manual}} transmission {{is thought to have}} been invented by Louis-René Panhard and Emile Levassor in the late 19 th century. This type of transmission offered multiple gear ratios and, in most cases, reverses. Almost all automobiles as of today are driven by internal combustion engines because of the high power to weight ratio, relatively good efûciency and compact energy storage associated with it. The major disadvantage with this engine is it’s incapability of producing torque from the rest, which is the characteristic of ideal traction hyperbola. This difference between characteristics curve of the combustion engine and the ideal traction hyperbola can be approximated by the use of a gear box. In this paper a <b>gear</b> box with <b>7</b> forward <b>gears</b> and 2 reverse gears has been described. A normal 7 speed MT requires 8 gear pairs to provide 7 forward and 1 reverse gear but this paper presents a novel 7 speed MT designed with just 6 <b>gear</b> pairs giving <b>7</b> forward and 2 reverse gears thereby saving both the material cost as well as meeting the space constraints...|$|R
