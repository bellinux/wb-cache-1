25|$|A {{liquid-crystal display}} (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other {{electronically}} modulated optical device {{that uses the}} light-modulating properties of liquid crystals. Liquid crystals do not emit light directly, instead using a backlight or reflector to produce images in colour or monochrome. LCDs are available to display arbitrary images (as in a general-purpose computer display) or fixed images with low information content, which can be displayed or hidden, such as preset words, digits, and <b>7-segment</b> displays, as in a digital clock. They use the same basic technology, except that arbitrary images {{are made up of}} a large number of small pixels, while other displays have larger elements.|$|E

50|$|Eurypterids {{have been}} {{formally}} described as follows: Small to very large merostomes with elongate lanceolate, rarely trilobed body; prosoma head of moderate size; opisthosoma body with 12 moveable segments and styliform to spatulate telson tail, with division commonly into <b>7-segmented</b> preabdomen and 5-segmented postabdomen; prosomal head appendages 6, comprising 3-jointed chelicerae, walking legs, the last pair commonly transformed into swimming legs. Mouth central, bordered posteriorly by endostoma and metastoma. Operculum with median genital appendage, abdominal appendages plate-shaped with nonlaminate gills. Ordovician-Permian. The typical eurypterid had a large, flat, semicircular carapace, {{followed by a}} jointed section, and finally a tapering, flexible tail, most ending with a long spine at the end (Pterygotus, though, had a large flat tail, possibly with a smaller spine). Behind the head, eurypterids had twelve body segments, each of which was formed from a dorsal plate (tergite) and a ventral plate (sternite). The tail, known as the telson, is spiked in most eurypterids (as in modern scorpions) and in some species {{it may have been}} used to inject venom, but {{there is no evidence that}} any eurypterids were venomous. Most eurypterids have paddles toward the end of the carapace and beyond, which were used to propel themselves through water. The suborder Stylonurina had walking legs instead of paddles. Some argue that the paddles were also used for digging. Underneath, in addition to the pair of swimming appendages, the creature had four pairs of jointed legs for walking, and two claws at the front, chelicerae, which were enlarged in pterygotids. The walking legs had odd hairs, similar to modern-day crabs. Other features, common to ancient and modern arthropods of this type, include one pair of compound eyes and a pair of smaller eye spots, called ocelli, located between the other, larger, pair of eyes.|$|R

50|$|For many applications, dot-matrix LCDs {{have largely}} {{superseded}} LED displays, though even in LCDs <b>7-segment</b> displays are very common. Unlike LEDs, {{the shapes of}} elements in an LCD panel are arbitrary since they are formed on the display {{by a kind of}} printing process. In contrast, the shapes of LED segments tend to be simple rectangles, reflecting {{the fact that they have}} to be physically moulded to shape, which makes it difficult to form more complex shapes than the segments of <b>7-segment</b> displays. However, the high common recognition factor of <b>7-segment</b> displays, and the comparatively high visual contrast obtained by such displays relative to dot-matrix digits, makes seven-segment multiple-digit LCD screens very common on basic calculators.|$|E

50|$|Depending on {{the shape}} and on the {{arrangement}} of the picture elements of a display, either fixed information can be displayed (symbols, signs), simple numerals (<b>7-segment</b> layout) or arbitrary shapes can be formed (dot-matrix displays).|$|E
50|$|Because only {{a single}} set of LEDs, all having a common anode or cathode, can be lit {{simultaneously}} without turning on unintended LEDs, Charlieplexing requires frequent output changes, through a method known as flickering. When flickering is done, not all LEDs are lit quite simultaneously, but rather one set of LEDs is lit briefly, then another set, then another, and eventually the cycle repeats. If it is done fast enough, they will appear to all be on, all the time, to the human eye (persistence of vision). In order for a display to not have any noticeable flicker, the refresh rate for each LED must be greater than 50 Hz. Suppose 8 tri-state pins are used to control 56 LEDs through Charlieplexing, which is enough for 8 <b>7-segment</b> displays (without decimal points). Typically <b>7-segment</b> displays are made to have a common cathode, sometimes a common anode, but {{without loss of generality}} suppose it is a common cathode. All LEDs in all 8 <b>7-segment</b> displays cannot be turned on simultaneously in any desired combination using Charlieplexing. It is impossible to get 56 bits of information directly from 8 trits (the term for a base-3 character, as the pins are 3-state) of information, as 8 trits fundamentally comprises 8 log23, or about 12.7 bits of information, which falls far short of the 56 bits required to turn all 56 LEDs on or off in any arbitrary combination. Instead, the human eye must be fooled by use of a flicker. Only one <b>7-segment</b> display, one set of 7 LEDs can be active at any time. The way this would be done is for the 8 common cathodes of the 8 displays to each get assigned to its own unique pin among the 8 I/O ports. At any time, one and only one of the 8 controlling I/O pins will be actively low, and thus only the <b>7-segment</b> display with its common cathode connected to that actively low pin can have any of its LEDs on. That is the active <b>7-segment</b> display. The anodes of the 7 LED segments within the active <b>7-segment</b> display can then be turned on in any combination by having the other 7 I/O ports either high or in high-impedance mode, in any combination. They are connected to the remaining 7 pins, but through resistors (the common cathode connection is connected to the pin itself, not through a resistor, because otherwise the current through each individual segment would depend on the number of total segments turned on, as they would all have to share a single resistor). But to show a desired number using all 8 digits, only one <b>7-segment</b> display can be shown at a time, so all 8 must be cycled through separately, and in a 50th of a second for the entire period of 8. Thus the display must be refreshed at 400 Hz for the period-8 cycle through all 8 segments to make the LEDs flash no slower than 50 times per second. This requires constant interruption of whatever additional processing the controller performs, 400 times per second.|$|E

50|$|Input was {{normally}} {{done with}} a hexadecimal keyboard, using a machine language monitor program, and the display only consisted of a <b>7-segment</b> display.

50|$|Several <b>7-segment</b> displays, or an LCD {{screen on}} more {{expensive}} models display {{the position of}} each machine axis.

However, it gains cubic power/root, hyperbolic trigonometry, angle unit conversion, polar/cartesian coordinate conversion, complex number calculation, Bin/Oct/Hex calculations (without logical operations) over EL-500W. Total function is 131.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, seven-segment {{displays}} {{can be used}} to show {{various other}} letters of the Latin, Cyrillic and Greek alphabets including punctuation, but few representations are unambiguous and intuitive at the same time. Short messages giving status information (e.g. [...] "no dISC" [...] on a CD player) are also commonly represented on <b>7-segment</b> displays. In the case of such messages it is not necessary for every letter to be unambiguous, merely for the words as a whole to be readable.|$|E
