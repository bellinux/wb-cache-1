The aim of this thesis is to design an efficient photo voltaic <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> and construction of omega type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station.</b> That's why various models were designed and calculated amount of energy. A photovoltaic <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> has 16 photovoltaic modules with dimensions 1293 mm* 329 mm* 34 mm. In this study five different type of solar <b>charge</b> <b>stations</b> were compared. These are, omega type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> (first type), south facing type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> with different angles (second type), south facing type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> with fixed angles (third type), inverse of omega type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> (fourth type), optimisation of south facing type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> with different angles (fifth type).

40|$|We propose {{an online}} pricing {{mechanism}} for electric vehicle (EV) <b>charging.</b> A <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> decides prices for each arriving EV {{depending on the}} energy and the time within which the EV will be served (i. e. deadline). The user selects either one of the contracts by paying the prescribed price or rejects all depending on their surpluses. The <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> can serve users using renewable energy and conventional energy. Users may select longer deadlines as {{they may have to}} pay less because of the less amount of conventional energy, however, they have to wait a longer period. We consider a myopic <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> and show that there exists a pricing mechanism which jointly maximizes the social welfare and the profit of the <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> when the <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> knows the utilities of the users. However, when the <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> does not know the utilities of the users, the social welfare pricing strategy may not maximize the expected profit of the <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> and even the profit may be 0. We propose a fixed profit pricing strategy which provides a guaranteed fixed profit to the <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> and can maximize the profit in practice. We empirically show that our proposed mechanism reduces the peak-demand and utilizes the limited charging spots in a <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> efficiently.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{describe}} the brokerage function between electric vehicle users searching for a charging spot and the <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> providing the <b>charging</b> service. Matching supply and demand requires an interdisciplinary understanding of both the mobility of electric vehicle (EV) users and the load balancing mechanisms, at the <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> level {{as well as at}} low voltage grid level. As a result of a mobility study, we propose in this work a routing service for locating and reserving charging spots.

Further contributions address the load balancing functionality at the <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> and the low voltage grid level.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> pricing and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) station selection. When a PEV needs to be charged, it selects a <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> by considering the charging prices, waiting times, and travel distances. Each <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> optimizes its <b>charging</b> price based on the prediction of the PEVs' <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> selection decisions and the other station's pricing decision, {{in order to maximize}} its profit. To obtain insights of such a highly coupled system, we consider a one-dimensional system with two competing <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> and Poisson arriving PEVs. We propose a multi-leader-multi-follower Stackelberg game model, in which the <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> (leaders) announce their charging prices in Stage I, and the PEVs (followers) make their <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> selections in Stage II. We show that there always exists a unique <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> selection equilibrium in Stage II, and such equilibrium depends on the charging stations' service capacities and the price difference between them. We then characterize the sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the pricing equilibrium in Stage I. We also develop a low complexity algorithm that efficiently computes the pricing equilibrium and the subgame perfect equilibrium of the two-stage Stackelberg game. Comment: 15 pages, 21 figure...|$|R

40|$|The ZEBRO is a fully {{autonomous}} six-legged robot {{designed for}} swarm behaviour {{and is the}} size of an A 4 sheet of paper. However, there does not exist an <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> for the ZEBRO yet. At this time, the battery still has to be replaced manually, which defeats the purpose of an autonomous system. An autonomous <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> has to be designed to complete the system. The <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> can be split into 3 parts: the autonomous <b>charging</b> <b>station,</b> the wireless power transfer, and the battery management system (located in the ZEBRO). In this particular thesis, the autonomous <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> will be discussed. Since all components in the ZEBRO are built to be modular, the design of the autonomous <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> is chosen to fit this principle. The <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> will consist of one central unit, and several connectable (modular) pads. Each pad will be able to hold and charge a single ZEBRO in 30 minutes. The <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> contains a communication module to communicate its location to ZEBRO's in need of charging. To calculate the locations of the connected pads, a grid will be created by serial communication between the <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> and the connected pads through Raspberry Pi's. (The pads do not have a communication module and do not have their location defined) To power the wireless power transfer unit, a power supply of 48 V and 500 W will be implemented in the <b>charging</b> <b>station.</b> Each pad will consume about 100 W, so a maximum of 4 pads can be connected.

40|$|The {{market share}} of plug-in {{electric}} vehicles (PEVs) has been increasing {{in the last years}} which comes along with a raising demand for public <b>charging</b> <b>stations.</b> While the operation of low-power <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> (Mode- 3) is far from being profitable, prospects for fast <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> indicate attractive revenues. This is mainly based on a higher workload (shorter charging times), a higher willingness-to-pay of customers and a higher complementary situation compared to home-based charging [1]. Both also serve for different purposes: Slow charging is performed whenever there is an opportunity while fast charging will also allow short stops to recharge on long-distance trips (interim charging). In this paper, we investigate the potential for combining interim and opportunity charging at one location in order to increase the utilization and decrease the payback time of public fast <b>charging</b> <b>stations.</b> For modeling the operation of Mode- 3 <b>charging</b> <b>stations,</b> we applied the ALADIN model [2] and combine it with results from an optimal allocation of fast charging points in Germany (cf.
