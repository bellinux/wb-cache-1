They then began to bombard Phuoc Luong accurately with heavy artillery and launched a concerted armor/infantry ground attack on the 27th.Any counterattack or relief effort contemplated by the South Vietnamese was doomed by the thousands of refugees that took to the roads in order to escape the fighting. Desertion among South Vietnamese units became common, as soldiers began disappearing from the ranks in search of family members. This pattern was to become too common as the offensive continued, not just among the territorial forces, but among the regular troops. On 2 January an emergency meeting {{was held at the}} Independence Palace in Saigon between President Thiệu, the Joint General Staff, and General Dong. At the meeting, Dong presented a plan for the relief of Phước Long that would have utilized either an infantry division or the Airborne Division. The plan was turned down for three reasons: first, there were simply no reserve forces of sufficient size available anywhere in the country for the task; second, with all overland routes in enemy hands, all movements and logistics would have to depend entirely on airlift, a capability that no longer existed; and third, despite advantageous defensive positions, the forces at Phước Long could not hold off two communist divisions long enough for any relief effort to succeed. The decision was then reached. Phước Long City and province would be surrendered to North Vietnamese forces as a matter of expediency, since it was considered to be strategically less important than Tây Ninh, Pleiku, or Huế - economically, politically, and demographically.|$|E

An “elementary landscape” exists if the objective function f is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian of the graph induced by the neighborhood operator; this allows various statistics about the neighborhood to be computed in closed form. A new component based model makes it relatively simple to prove that certain types of landscapes are elementary. The traveling salesperson problem, weighted graph (vertex) coloring and the minimum graph bisection problem yield elementary landscapes under commonly used local search operators. The component model is then used to efficiently compute the mean objective function value over partial neighborhoods for these same problems. For a traveling salesperson problem over n cities, the 2 -opt neighborhood can be decomposed into ⌊n/ 2 − 1 ⌋ partial neighborhoods.

This phenomenon, highly complex, has become the focus of several international organizations since the consequences of air pollution are felt outside the country borders.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Aeromedical {{transfer}} {{can reduce}} transfer times for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Delays in dispatch {{of the helicopter}} and landing-reperfusion can reduce the benefits of air travel. The ad hoc nature of these transfers may compound delays. A formal aeromedical transfer service, with rapid dispatch protocols and rapid landing to balloon times could significantly reduce reperfusion times. METHODS: A standard operating procedure (SOP) was developed using a field assessment team (doctor, aircrew paramedic) and a cardiologist-led multidisciplinary team meeting the incoming aircraft. The aeromedical SOP for STEMI care was implemented when anticipated land journey > 30 min to the nearest PPCI centre. Reperfusion times for actual air travel and estimated virtual land journeys from the same location were compared. RESULTS: Between April and December 2009, 8 patients were managed according to the aeromedical SOP. Median air distance 49 miles and road, 40 miles. All subsequent data shown in median minutes (range). Call-balloon time 109 (97 - 116). Call-aeromedical activation 13 (9 - 26). Aeromedical activation-arrive scene 12 (9 - 16). Time at scene 29 (24 - 52). Call-depart scene 57 (45 - <b>75).</b> <b>Air</b> journey 25 (18 - 30) and landing-balloon 21 (8 - 22). Call-arrive at PPCI centre for air 85 (70 - 95); estimated virtual road call-arrive at PPCI centre 102 (85 - 104). CONCLUSIONS: This SOP delivered sub 120 min call-balloon times in all cases undergoing PPCI from difficult locations where anticipated land journeys were > 30 min. With longer anticipated land journeys (or more remote locations) the proportional gains with air transfer will be greater. Subject to a formal SOP and very rapid landing-balloon times, aeromedical transfer can significantly {{reduce the number of}} patients suffering long reperfusion delays in acute myocardial infarction.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Airway {{inflammatory}} response {{is widely believed}} to be a central mechanism in the development of adverse health effects related to air pollution exposure. Increased ventilation and inspiratory flow rates due to physical activity in the presence of air pollution will increase the inhaled dose of air pollutants. However, physical activity can also affect lung function and may moderate the relationship between air pollution and lung function. The mechanisms that underpin the complex interplay between air pollution, physical activity, and lung function may be more sensitive to the inhaled dose of air pollution than to ambient air pollution exposure alone. Despite this, the majority of literature on the topic measures only the ambient concentration of air pollution. AIM: This study aims to characterize the relationship between inhaled air pollution dose, physical activity, and respiratory response markers of lung function, oxidative stress and inflammation among healthy adolescents. Respiratory response measures include exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), percent oxidized exhaled breath condensate glutathione (%GSSG), percent oxidized exhaled breath condensate cysteine (%CYSS), the percentage of total oxidized compounds (%Oxidized), and changes in pulmonary function, namely, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume (FEV 1), and forced expiratory flow (FEF 25 - <b>75).</b> <b>Air</b> pollution measures include cumulative inhaled doses of fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5), ozone (O 3), black carbon (BC), and particle number total (PNT). METHODS: Using a non-probability sample of high school athletes, outcomes were measured prior to and after participation in extracurricular sports practice. The inhaled dose of air pollutants during the sports practice was estimated for each participant using a novel method developed by Dr. Roby Greenwald. This observational study estimates the association between air pollution dose and outcome measures using general linear mixed models with an unstructured covariance structure and a random intercept for subject to account for repeated measures within subjects. All data analysis was completed using SAS. RESULTS: A one IQR (i. e. 345. 64 µg) increase in O 3 inhaled dose is associated with a 29. 16 % average decrease from baseline in %Oxidized. A one IQR (i. e. 2. 368 E+ 10 particle) increase in PNT inhaled dose is associated with an average decrease in FEF 25 - 75 of 0. 168 L/second from baseline. The relationship between PNT inhaled dose and eNO is moderated by activity level, with increasing activity levels attenuating the relationship. Similarly, the relationship between O 3 inhaled dose and %CYSS is attenuated by activity level, with increasing activity levels corresponding to smaller changes from baseline for a constant O 3 inhaled dose. DISCUSSION: Someone who inhales a high cumulative dose despite a low activity level is likely breathing in a higher concentration of air pollution in a shorter period of time than a person who receives the same dose with a high activity level. The moderating effects of activity level suggest that peaks of high concentration doses of air pollution may overwhelm cells’ endogenous redox balance resulting in increased airway inflammation. Further research that examines the relationships between dose peaks over time and inflammation could help to determine whether a high concentration dose over {{a short period of time}} has a different effect than a lower concentration dose over a longer period of time...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{large-scale}} microalgal {{production in}} tubular photobioreactors, the build-up of O 2 along the tubes {{is one of}} the major bottlenecks to obtain high productivities. Oxygen inhibits the growth, since it competes with carbon dioxide for the Rubisco enzyme involved in the CO 2 fixation to generate biomass. The effect of oxygen on growth of Nannochloropsis sp. was experimentally deter-mined in a fully controlled flat-panel photobioreactor operated in turbidostat mode using an incident photon flux density of 100 μmol photons m− 2 s− 1 and with only the oxygen concentration as variable parameter. The dissolved oxygen concentration was varied from 20 to 250 % air saturation. Results showed that there was no clear effect of oxygen concentration on specific growth rate (mean of 0. 48 ± 0. 40 day− 1) upon increasing the oxygen concentration from 20 % to <b>75</b> % <b>air</b> saturation. Upon further increasing the oxygen concentration, however, a linear decrease in specific growth rate was observed, ranging from 0. 48 ± 0. 40 day− 1 at a dissolved oxygen concentration of <b>75</b> % <b>air</b> saturation to 0. 18 ± 0. 01 day− 1 at 250 % air saturation. In vitro data on isolated Rubisco were used to predict the quantum yield at different oxygen concentrations in the medium. The pre-dicted decrease in quantum yield matches well with the observed decrease that was measured in vivo. These results indicate that the effect of oxygen on growth of Nannochlor-opsis sp. at low light intensity is only due to competitive inhibition of the Rubisco enzyme. At these sub-saturating light conditions, the presence of high concentrations of oxygen in the medium induced slightly higher carotenoid content, but the increased levels of this protective antioxidant did not diminish the growth-inhibiting effects of oxygen on the Rubisco...|$|R
