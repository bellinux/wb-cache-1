The major active components of olive oil include oleic acid, phenolic compounds and squalene which have different benefits such as cancer prevention, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, and lowering the incidence of skin cancer, respectively. In recent years, the number of studies about the biochemical properties of different varieties of olive oils and their phenolic contents has dramatically increased. In this study, Turkish EVOO from different varieties and their phenolic compounds were investigated in terms of their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties as well as refined olive, hazelnut and canola oils. Antimicrobial activities of EVOOs and ten phenolic compounds were tested against three foodborne pathogenic bacteria, Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis which are the foremost bacterial cause of the largest number of outbreaks, cases and deaths in the world. While all EVOOs showed bactericidal effect the phenolics demonstrated slight antimicrobial activity with percent inhibition between 0 - 25 of growth rate of bacteria. Moreover, refined olive, hazelnut and canola oils did not show any antimicrobial activity. Finally, antioxidant activities of EVOOs, refined olive, hazelnut and canola oils were determined by B-carotene-linoleic acid model system and ABTS radical scavenging method. According to B-carotene-linoleic acid method, it was observed that antioxidant activities of oil samples varied between 21. 19 % and 64. 54 %. On the other hand, it was found that free radical scavenging activities varied between 1. 21 % and 21. 97 % as a result of ABTS method. These results were correlated with TPC values of oils...|$|R

Since the oil in the South Cuyama Field is not heavy, steam injection has not been necessary to reduce viscosity and improve flow; however, both gas injection and waterflooding have been used, both in the Colgrove and Dibblee formations. The field operators used waterflooding between 1956 and 1973 in the Colgrove, with some success, and both gas injection and waterflooding {{have been used in}} the Dibblee Formation commencing in 1964 and 1955, respectively. [...] As of 2008, E&B Resources still uses waterflooding to assist in flow of oil to pumping wells; other wells are designated for water disposal. [...] At the end of 2008, the average water cut - the percentage of liquid pumped from oil wells that was water - was running at 98.4 percent, indicating a field very close to the end of its useful life. Wells on the field were producing an average of <b>7.9</b> barrels of <b>oil</b> per day, and the operators have been reinjecting the enormous quantities of water produced with the oil back into the formation through approximately 50 water disposal and water flood wells scattered throughout the field.|$|R

Laboratory experiments {{have shown that the}} dissolution time of the emulsion polymer into the sea water is less than 15 minutes, and the viscosity of the polymer solution is larger than 15 mPa·s when the polymer concentration is 2000 mg/L under the temperature of 70. The viscosity of the polymer crosslinking system is larger than 150 mPa·s, and the modulus elasticity of the crosslinking system is larger than 500 mPa. A pilot test on two wells from the Shengli Chengao Oilfield was conducted to verify the practical application performance of the emulsion polymer. The pilot test shows that after 2 months emulsion polymer injection, the bottomhole pressure of the production wells has increased by 1. 48 - 1. <b>79</b> MPa, the <b>oil</b> production from one correspondent well has increased from 28. 67 t/d to 35. 8 t/d, and the water content in the production flow has decreased from 52. 3 % to 41. 7 %.

40|$|The {{volatility}} of the U. S. economy since the mid- 1980 s {{is much lower}} than {{it was during the}} prior 20 -year period. The proximate causes of the increased stability and their relative importance remain unsettled, but the sharpness of the volatility decline and its timing has led authors such as Taylor (2000) to argue that a sudden shift in monetary policy is a prime candidate. The authors assess this claim using a calibrated stochastic dynamic general equilibrium model to quantify the contribution of monetary policy and exogenous shocks to the postwar volatility pattern for U. S. output. Their principal finding is that the change in monetary policy played a relatively small role in the postwar volatility decline, accounting for 10 to 15 percent of the drop in real output volatility. The model attributes most of the output volatility decline to smaller TFP shocks: oil shocks end up increasing volatility in the post- 84 period relative to the pre- <b>79</b> period. Negative <b>oil</b> shocks do lead to significant downturns in real output in the model, but the pattern of exogenous shocks post- 84 is not different enough from the pre- 79 pattern to play a meaningful role in lowering output volatility.

These reforms, however, were drastically different from those anticipated by a population and its politicians accustomed as much to years of state-led development as to the interventionist legacies of both Pérez and his AD party. The difficulty of initiating economic reform in such a context became apparent when, just three weeks after his inauguration, Pérez faced the most violent riots in decades, triggered {{by an increase in}} bus fares.

Moreover, HS-SPME allowed the occurrence of isochavicol (29. 6 - 34. 7 %) as main component in D. crinitus leaves, but it was not detected in the oils, probably because of its solubility in water.
