40|$|AbstractKv <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> (KCNQ 1) {{channels}} are regulators of several physiological processes including vasodilatation, repolarization of cardiomyocytes, {{and control of}} secretory processes. A number of Kv <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> pore mutants are sensitive to extracellular potassium. We hypothesized that extracellular potassium also modulates wild-type Kv <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> channels. The Kv <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> currents were measured in Xenopus laevis oocytes at different concentrations of extracellular potassium (1 – 50  mM). As extracellular potassium was elevated, Kv <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> currents were reduced significantly more than expected from theoretical calculations based on the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz flux equation. Potassium inhibited the steady-state current with an IC 50 of 6. 0 ± 0. 2  mM. Analysis of tail-currents showed that potassium increased the fraction of channels in the inactivated state. Similarly, the recovery from inactivation was slowed by potassium, suggesting that extracellular potassium stabilizes an inactivated state in Kv <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> channels. The effect of extracellular potassium was absent in noninactivating Kv <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> /KCNE <b>1</b> and Kv <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> /KCNE 3 channels, further supporting a stabilized inactivated state as the underlying mechanism. Interestingly, coexpression of Kv <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> with KCNE 2 did not attenuate the inhibition by potassium. In {{a number of other}} Kv channels, including Kv 1. 5, Kv 4. 3, and Kv 7. 2 – 5 channels, currents were only minimally reduced by an increase in extracellular potassium as expected. These results show that extracellular potassium modulates Kv <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> channels and suggests that physiological changes in potassium concentrations may directly control the function of Kv <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> channels. This may represent a novel regulatory mechanism of excitability and of potassium transport in tissues expressing Kv <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> channels...|$|R

The level of relative immunogenicity was inferred from survival times of H- <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> -incompatible skin grafts donated by donors with different H- 2 haplotype origins of H- 2 D region genes. In this communication we report the results of an extension of these previous investigations into the possible role of H- 2 D region genes in controlling the capacity of H- <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> -incompatible lymphocytes to stimulate H- <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> -speciflc mixed lymphocyte culture proliferation and generation of cytotoxic effector cells. The results reported herein demonstrate that the H- 2 D genotype of H- <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> -incompatible stimulator cells determines the relative H- <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> -specific capacity of those lymphocytes to stimulate H- <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> -specific proliferation of in vivo primed responder T cells in secondary mixed lymphocyte culture. H- 2 D(b) -bearing, H- 7. l-incompatible stimulators were significantly more effective in stimulating H- <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> -specific proliferation than H- 2 D(d) -bearing stimulators. As expected, H- 2 D(b), H- <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> -in-compatible stimulators were also more effective than H- 2 D(d) a stimulators in generating H- <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> - specific cytotoxic effector cells. Further, the susceptibility of (51) Cr- labeled, H- <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> -incompatible lymphoblast targets to H- <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> -specific lysis was similarly regulated by an H- 2 D gene. Reciprocal H- 2 restriction (F(1) cells are capable of killing only the cells bearing the immunizing cell parental H- 2 haplotype) observed by other investigators for cytolysis of non-H- 2 -incompatible targets was not observed. H- 2 D a-bearing, H- <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> - incompatible stimulators stimulated generation of cytotoxic effectors capable of detectably lysing H- 2 D(b) but not H- 2 D(a) -bearing, H- <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> - incompatible targets.

40|$|International audienceABSTRACT: Tumor {{cells can}} escape {{the immune system}} by overexpressing {{molecules}} of the B 7 family, e. g. B <b>7</b> -H <b>1</b> (PD-L 1 or CD 86), which suppresses the anti-tumor T-cell responses through binding to the PD- 1 receptor, and similarly for B <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> (CD 80), through binding to CTLA- 4. Moreover, direct interactions between B <b>7</b> -H <b>1</b> and B <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> molecules {{are also likely to}} participate in the immunoevasion mechanism. In this study, we used a mouse model of tumor dormancy, DA 1 - 3 b leukemia cells. We previously showed that a minor population of DA 1 - 3 b cells persists in equilibrium with the immune system for long periods of time, and that the levels of surface expression of B <b>7</b> -H <b>1</b> and B <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> molecules correlates with the dormancy time. We found that leukemia cells DA 1 - 3 b/d 365 cells, which derived from long-term dormant tumors and overexpressed B <b>7</b> -H <b>1</b> and B <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> molecules, were highly permissive to Ad 5 FB 4, a human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad 5) vector pseudotyped with chimeric human-bovine fibers. Both B <b>7</b> -H <b>1</b> and B <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> were required for Ad 5 FB 4 -cell binding and entry, since (i) siRNA silencing of one or the other B 7 gene transcript resulted in a net decrease in the cell binding and Ad 5 FB 4 -mediated transduction of DA 1 - 3 b/d 365; and (ii) plasmid-directed expression of B <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> and B <b>7</b> -H <b>1</b> proteins conferred to Ad 5 FB 4 -refractory human cells a full permissiveness to this vector. Binding data and flow cytometry analysis suggested that B <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> and B <b>7</b> -H <b>1</b> molecules played different roles in Ad 5 FB 4 -mediated transduction of DA 1 - 3 b/d 365, with B <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> involved in cell attachment of Ad 5 FB 4, and B <b>7</b> -H <b>1</b> in Ad 5 FB 4 internalization. BRET analysis showed that B <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> and B <b>7</b> -H <b>1</b> formed heterodimeric complexes at the cell surface, and that Ad 5 FB 4 penton, the viral capsomere carrying the fiber projection, could negatively interfere with the formation of B <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> /B <b>7</b> -H <b>1</b> heterodimers, or modify their conformation. As interactors of B <b>7</b> -H <b>1</b> /B <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> molecules, Ad 5 FB 4 particles and/or their penton capsomeres represent potential therapeutic agents targeting cancer cells that had developed immunoevasion mechanisms...|$|R

30|$|Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) {{has been}} shown to inhibit the {{function}} of 70 S ribosomes to block protein synthesis (Mardirossian et al. 2014). Thus, the activity of His 6 -PrS 2 -Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) was tested using a cell-free protein expression system with a synthetic peptide Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 16) as a protein synthesis inhibitor (Seefeldt et al. 2016) as a control. As shown Fig.  3 b, the production of DHFR by the cell-free system was indeed inhibited by both His 6 -PrS 2 -Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) and Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) which was generated from His 6 -PrS 2 -Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) by Factor Xa treatment which resulted in a small amount of uncleaved His 6 -PrS 2 -Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) (Fig.  2 c). Notably, the cleavage mixture effectively inhibited the protein synthesis (Fig.  3 b). Since the minimum inhibitory concentration of Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) has been reported to be 0.5  μM (Benincasa et al. 2004), it is assumed that there was an excessive amount of Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) in the reaction mixture to inhibit protein synthesis. The PrS 2 tag is known not to interfere with its fusion partner (Kobayashi et al. 2009); for example, PrS 2 fused at the N-terminal end of OmpR, a phosphor sensory protein, did not inhibit the OmpR function at all (Kobayashi et al. 2009). Thus, it is not surprising to see that His 6 -PrS 2 -Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) possesses an antibacterial activity {{in spite of the fact}} that the N-terminal part of Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) {{has been shown}} to be crucial for the antimicrobial activity (Guida et al. 2015).|$|R

ResultsThe expression of gpKir <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed inwardly rectifying K+ currents. The reversal potential was strongly dependent on the extracellular K+ concentration, shifting from - 14 mV at 96 mmol/L K+ to - 90 mV at 1 mmol/L K+. gpKir <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> showed a low affinity for Ba 2 +. Significant expression of gpKir <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> was found in brain, kidney, and lung, but not in heart, skeletal muscle, liver, or spleen.

40|$|KCNJ 13 encodes Kir <b>7.</b> <b>1,</b> an {{inwardly}} rectifying K {{channel that}} {{is expressed in}} multiple ion-transporting epithelia. A mutation in KCNJ 13 resulting in an arginine-to-tryptophan change at residue 162 (R 162 W) of Kir <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> was associated with snowflake vitreoretinal degeneration, an inherited autosomal-dominant disease characterized by vitreous de-generation and mild retinal degeneration. We used the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system to assess the functional properties of the R 162 W (mutant) Kir <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> channel and determine how wild-type (WT) Kir <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> {{is affected by the}} presence of the mutant subunit. Recordings obtained via the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique revealed that injection of oocytes with mutant Kir <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> cRNA resulted in currents and cation selectivity that were indistinguishable from those in water-injected oocytes, suggesting that the mutant protein does not form functional channels in the plasma membrane.

40|$|Kir <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> is an {{inwardly}} rectifying K+ {{channel of}} the Kir superfamily encoded by the kcnj 13 gene. Kir <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> {{is present in}} epithelial tissues where it colocalizes with the Na+/K+-pump probably serving to recycle K+ {{taken up by the}} pump. Human mutations affecting Kir <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> are associated with retinal degeneration diseases. We generated a mouse lacking Kir <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> by ablation of the Kcnj 13 gene. Homozygous mutant null mice die hours after birth and show cleft palate and moderate retardation in lung development. Kir <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> is expressed in the epithelium covering the palatal processes at the time at which palate sealing takes place and our results suggest it might play an essential role in late palatogenesis. Our work also reveals a second unexpected role in the development and the physiology of the respiratory system, where Kir <b>7.</b> <b>1</b> is expressed in epithelial cells all along the respiratory tree...|$|R
30|$|Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) is a PR-AMP {{isolated}} from bovine and {{belongs to the}} cathelicidin family (Scocchi et al. 1997). The cathelicidins serve {{a critical role in}} mammalian innate immune defense against invasive bacterial infection (Zanetti 2004), and Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) was found from bovine neutrophils together with cathelicidin as a antimicrobial peptides (Romeo et al. 1988; Gennaro et al. 1989). Later, Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) was shown to inhibit DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in E. coli (Mardirossian et al. 2014) after penetrating in the cells through SmbA, a peptide transporter (Mattiuzzo et al. 2007). Recently, Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) was shown to bind to 70 S ribosome resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis (Mardirossian et al. 2014). Despite the high toxicity to Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Enterobacter cloacae at 1 – 10  μM, Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) has remarkably low cytotoxicity to the host mammalian cells (not toxic even at 50  μM) (Tomasinsig et al. 2006). Therefore, Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) has been extensively studied because of its potential use for clinical application. A method to stabilize Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) by PEGylation has been developed to reduce its renal clearance by which Bac <b>7</b> (<b>1</b> – 35) still retains its antibacterial activity as well as cell penetration activity (Benincasa et al. 2015).|$|R
