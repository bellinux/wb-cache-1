Here we compare their performance for prostate cancer treatment. Methods Ten prostate patients were planned using IMPT with robustness optimization, VMAT, and 43 ̆c 0 to an initial dose of 540 Gy to a clinical target volume (CTV) that encompassed the prostate and seminal vesicles, then a boost prescription dose of 25. 20 Gy to the prostate for a total dose of 79. 20 Gy. The IMPT plans utilized two coplanar, oblique scanning beams 100 posterior of the lateral beam positions. Range uncertainties were taken into consideration in the IMPT plans. VMAT plans used two full, coplanar arcs to ensure sufficient PTV coverage. 43 ̆c 0 plans were created by inversely selecting and optimizing 30 beams from 1162 candidate non-coplanar beams using a greedy column generation algorithm.

Tests were devised {{to examine the}} impact of SS cathodes on anode materials with or without the accrual of marine biofilms. Biofilmed SS cathodes significantly enhanced the rate of corrosion of nickel, causing noble shifts in the couple potentials. With mild steel and zinc as the anodes, calcareous deposits developed quite rapidly on the SS cathodes and led to a significant reduction of bacterial numbers. The calcareous deposits also caused substantial reduction of galvanic corrosion rates for mild steel, whereas there was no difference for zinc. The deposits were identified by XRD as essentially carbonates, oxides and hydroxides of calcium and magnesium. Potentiodynamic polarization performed on the actual couples after disconnection and equilibration provided reasonable interpretations of the galvanic corrosion trends.

40|$|This thesis {{originates}} {{with the}} development and characterisation of polypyrrole (PPy), formed {{in the presence of}} a large protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA). The BSA was incorporated into the polymer film during electropolymerisation from an aqueous solution of pyrrole monomer, BSA and NaCl as a supporting electrolyte. The presence of the BSA within the polymer film was confirmed using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with electron dispersive X-Ray analysis (EDX). Optimum conditions for the growth of the polypyrrole-bovine serum albumin film (PPy-BSA) were obtained by varying the concentration of the monomer and BSA, the applied potential and the polymerisation charge. Highly adherent polymers were formed at 0. <b>70</b> <b>V</b> <b>vs.</b> SCE in a 0. 10 mol dm- 3 NaCl supporting electrolyte with high concentrations of pyrrole (0. 5 mol dm- 3) and low concentrations of BSA (< 200 μL). The presence of the BSA within the polymer film greatly reduced the electroactivity of the film. The urease enzyme was also immobilised in the polypyrrole film. The modified polypyrrole film was formed at 0. <b>70</b> <b>V</b> <b>vs.</b> SCE from an aqueous solution of pyrrole and urease (4000 mg dm- 3) in the presence of 0. 10 mol dm- 3 NaCl as a supporting electrolyte. The presence of urease within the polypyrrole-urease (PPy-Urs-Cl) film was confirmed using SEM and EDX and the PPy-Urs-Cl was then investigated as a sensing material for urea. The PPy-Urs-Cl film exhibited a reasonable sensitivity towards urea of 5. 41 μC μM- 1 in the 1. 0 x 10 - 5 to 1. 0 x 10 - 3 mol dm- 3 urea concentration range. Sulphonated-β-cyclodextrin (SCD) was then incorporated into the polymer to give a PPy-Urs-SCD film. This PPy-Urs-SCD polymer film was investigated as a sensing material for urea in a phosphate buffer solution. It was found that the SCD dopant greatly enhanced the detection of urea, with detection of urea in the 1. 0 x 10 - 10 mol dm- 3 region and a sensitivity of 46. 09 μC μM- 1. A wide variety of interfering compounds was examined to establish their effect, if any, on the detection of urea using the modified PPy-Urs-SCD. The interference from the common biological interfering compound, ascorbic acid, was effectively blocked and no interference was observed in the presence of common salts, such as ammonium chloride. Interference was observed in the presence of uric acid, hydroxyurea, thiourea and creatinine. The urease enzyme and the SCD are large, giving rise to porous PPy-Urs-SCD films and this allows access of the interfering compounds to the electrode surface. However, this interference was reduced by depositing a layer of the more compact PPy-Urs-Cl followed by the PPy-Urs-SCD film. A detailed investigation into the host-guest complexation properties of SCD with urea, and the interfering compounds, was performed using cyclic voltammetry. Clear evidence for complexation between SCD as the host molecule and urea as the guest molecule was obtained, which accounts for the high sensitivity in the detection of urea. No inclusion complex was formed between urea and the α-SCD or between SCD and the interfering compounds...|$|R
40|$|The {{impedance}} {{behavior of}} silicon nanowire electrodes {{has been investigated}} to understand the electrochemical process kinetics that influences the performance when used as a high-capacity anode in a lithium ion battery. The ac response was measured by using impedance spectroscopy in equilibrium conditions at different lithium compositions and during several cycles of charge and discharge in a half cell <b>vs.</b> metallic lithium. The impedance analysis shows the contribution of both surface resistance and solid state diffusion through {{the bulk of the}} nanowires. The surface process is dominated by a solid electrolyte layer (SEI) consisting of an inner, inorganic insoluble part and several organic compounds at the outer interface, as seen by XPS analysis. The surface resistivity, which seems to be correlated with the Coulombic efficiency of the electrode, grows at very high lithium contents due to an increase in the inorganic SEI thickness. We estimate the diffusion coefficient of about 2 × 10 - 10 cm 2 /s for lithium diffusion in silicon. A large increase in the electrode impedance was observed at very low lithium compositions, probably due to a different mechanism for lithium diffusion inside the wires.

In that temperature range, the increased catalytic activity originates from the well dispersed N- 4 -metal moiety or from fragments of the original molecule still containing the metal bound to nitrogen. Short term stability tests on the initially most active catalysts revealed the instability of these catalysts in comparison to those obtained at higher pyrolysis temperatures (900 - 1000 degrees C). At these pyrolysis temperatures the active site of the catalysts is inorganic in nature. The presence of iron and cobalt in their metallic states in these catalysts has been confirmed using XRD. TEM of the catalysts pyrolyzed at these higher temperatures revealed that most of the iron and cobalt are encapsulated in a graphite-like coating. The better stability of these catalysts in the acidic environment of a working fuel cell may be ascribed to the presence of this protective coating.

The activity of the former catalyst was determined to be approximately one half that of a commercial platinum catalyst containing the same amount of metal (2 wt%).

40|$|It is {{well-established}} that S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) {{serves as}} the methyl group donor in methylations of DNA, hormones, neurotransmitters and signal transduction systems. However, {{a new class of}} enzymatic reactions involving SAM has recently attracted considerable attention. In these systems, SAM initiates radical-based reactions at the active sites of enzymes via formation of an adenosyl radical, which further abstracts a H-atom from the substrate to initiate a radical-based mechanism. However, modeling studies of radical SAM enzymes have been hindered, by difficulties in preparing adequate synthetic [Fe 4 S 4] clusters. We prepared a novel series of Fe(II) complexes with tripodal tris(2 -hydroxybenzyl) amine ligands, which replicate the geometry of the unique Fe centers found in radical SAM enzymes. The resulting complexes were characterized by X-ray crystallography, paramagnetic 1 H NMR spectroscopy, electronic absorption spectroscopy, and electrochemical methods. The complexes were evaluated by three criteria established to model the unique Fe site in radical SAM proteins: i) a high spin state, ii) a low redox potential near the value measured for the enzymes (ca. - 0. <b>70</b> <b>V</b> <b>vs</b> SCE), and iii) coordinative unsaturation, such that Fe center can bind exogenous ligands with sulfonium cations. To determine whether the resulting synthetic models are capable of reductively cleaving S-C bonds to generate radical species, we also prepared sulfonium salts that contain metal-binding moieties, such as a pyridyl group, which position the reactive sulfonium group close to the Fe(II) center. GC-MS and 1 H NMR spectroscopy were used to characterize and quantify the resulting products. By monitoring changes in UV-visible absorption features as a function of time, we have measured reaction rates for the following sulfonium cations: S-(phenyl) tetramethylenesulfonium and S-(2 -pyridylmethyl) tetramethylenesulfonium. These experiments allowed us to evaluate the effect of Fe∙∙∙S distance on the rate of electron transfer. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed to further elucidate significant interactions within this synthetic modeling system...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were 1) to evaluate the effect of different right atrial electrode locations on the efficacy of low energy transvenous defibrillation with an implantable lead system; and 2) to qualitate and quantify the discomfort from atrial defibrillation shocks delivered by a clinically relevant method. Background. Biatrial shocks result in the lowest thresholds for transvenous atrial defibrillation, but the optimal right atrial and coronary sinus electrode locations for defibrillation efficacy in humans have not been defined. Methods. Twenty- eight patients (17 men, 11 women) with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) (lasting ≤ 1 month) were studied. Transvenous atrial defibrillation was performed by delivering R wave-synchronized biphasic shocks with incremental shock levels (from 180 to 400 <b>V</b> in steps of 40 <b>V).</b> Different electrode location combinations were used and tested randomly: the anterolateral, inferomedial right atrium or high right atrial appendage to the distal coronary sinus. Defibrillation thresholds were defined in duplicate by using the step-up protocol. Pain perception of shock delivery was assessed by using a purpose-designed questionnaire; sedation was given when the shock level was unacceptable (tolerability threshold). Results. Sinus rhythm was restored in 26 of 28 patients by using {{at least one of the}} right atrial electrode locations tested. The conversion rate with the anterolateral right atrial location (21 [81 %] of 26) was higher than that with the inferomedial right atrial location (8 [50 %] of 16, p 0. 05). The mean defibrillation thresholds for the high right atrial appendage, anterolateral right atrium and inferomedial right atrium were all significantly different with respect to energy (3. 9 ± 1. 8 J <b>vs.</b> 4. 6 ± 1. 8 J <b>vs.</b> 6. 0 ± 1. 7 J, respectively, p < 0. 05) and voltage (317 ± 77 <b>V</b> <b>vs.</b> 348 ± <b>70</b> <b>V</b> <b>vs.</b> 396 ± 66 <b>V,</b> respectively, p < 0. 05). Patients tolerated a mean of 3. 4 ± 2 shocks with a tolerability threshold of 255 ± 60 <b>V,</b> 2. 5 ± 1. 3 J. Conclusions. Low energy, transvenous defibrillation with an implantable defibrillation lead system is an effective treatment for AF. Most patients can tolerate two to three shocks, and, when the staffing shock level (189 <b>V)</b> is close to the defibrillation threshold, they can tolerate on average a shock level of 260 <b>V</b> without sedation. Electrodes should be positioned in the distal coronary sinus and in the high right atrial appendage to achieve the lowest defibrillation threshold, although other locations may be suitable for certain patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Methods: From January 2008 through August 2013, 70 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated definitively with hypofractionated helical tomotherapy. The helical tomotherapy was designed to deliver 75 Gy in 2. 5 Gy per fraction to the prostate gland, 63 Gy in 2. 1 Gy per fraction to the seminal vesicles, and 54 Gy in 1. 8 Gy per fraction to the pelvic lymph nodes. Incidence rates and predictive factors for radiation toxicities were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The incidences of grades 0, 1, and 2 acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity were 51. 4 %, 42. 9 %, and 5. 7 %, and those of acute genitourinary (GU) toxicity were 7. 1 %, 64. 3 %, and 28. 6 %, respectively. The maximum dose of rectum and bladder <b>V</b> 40 and <b>V</b> 50 were significant predictive factors for acute GI and GU toxicity. The cutoff value of rectum maximum dose and bladder <b>V</b> 40 and <b>V</b> 50 by receiver-operating characteristic curves analysis were 76. 5 Gy, 17. 3 %, and 10. 2 %, respectively. The incidences of grades 0, 1, and 2 late GI toxicity were 82. 0 %, 14. 0 %, and 4. 0 %, and those of late GU toxicity were 18. 0 %, 56. 0 %, and 26. 0 %, respectively. Rectum <b>V</b> <b>70</b> and bladder <b>V</b> <b>70</b> and <b>V</b> 75 were significant predictive factors for late GI and GU toxicity. The cutoff value of rectum <b>V</b> <b>70</b> and bladder <b>V</b> <b>70</b> and <b>V</b> 75 by receiver-operating characteristic curves analysis was 2. 8 %, 2. 8 %, and 1. 0 %, respectively. Conclusion: Hypofractionated helical tomotherapy using a schedule of 75 Gy at 2. 5 Gy per fraction had favorable acute and late toxicity rates and no serious complication, such as grade 3 or worse toxicity. To minimize radiation toxicities, constraining the rectum maximum dose to less than 76. 5 Gy, rectum <b>V</b> <b>70</b> to less than 2. 8 %, bladder <b>V</b> 40 to less than 17. 3 %, bladder <b>V</b> 50 to less than 10. 2 %, bladder <b>V</b> <b>70</b> to less than 2. 8 %, and bladder <b>V</b> 75 to less than 1. 0 % would be necessary.

Analytes were prepared with laboratory purified water and natural water samples (from Mogi-Guacu River, SP). The electrochemical techniques were applied to 1. 0 mol L- 1 Na 2 SO 4 solutions, at pH 5. 5, and containing different concentrations of paraquat, {{in the range of}} 1 to 10 mu mol L- 1, using a gold ultramicroelectrode. 5 replicate experiments were conducted and in each the mean value for peak currents obtained - 0. <b>70</b> <b>V</b> <b>vs.</b> Ag/AgCl yielded excellent linear relationships with pesticide concentrations. The slope values for the calibration plots (method sensitivity) were 4. 06 x 10 (- 3), 1. 07 x 10 (- 2) and 2. 95 x 10 (- 2) A mol(- 1) L for purified water by differential pulse voltammetry, square wave voltammetry and multiple square wave voltammetry, respectively. For river water samples, the slope values were 2. 60 x 10 (- 3), 1. 06 x 10 (- 2) and 3. 35 x 10 (- 2) A mol(- 1) L, respectively, showing a small interference from the natural matrix components in paraquat determinations. The detection limits for paraquat determinations were calculated by two distinct methodologies, i. e., as proposed by IUPAC and a statistical method. The values obtained with multiple square waves voltammetry were 0. 002 and 0. 12 mu mol L- 1, respectively, for pure water electrolytes. The detection limit from IUPAC recommendations, when inserted in the calibration curve equation, an analytical signal (oxidation current) is smaller than the one experimentally observed for the blank solution under the same experimental conditions. This is inconsistent with the definition of detection limit, thus the IUPAC methodology requires further discussion. The same conclusion can be drawn by the analyses of detection limits obtained with the other techniques studied.

Essa coordenaÃÃo se dÃ atravÃs de ligaÃÃo &# 963; entre o Ãtomo de nitrogÃnio de uma das nitrilas, evidenciada pelo surgimento de um maior nÃmero de bandas referentes ao estiramento C&# 8801;N, comparativamente aos ligantes livres de coordenaÃÃo. A observaÃÃo do deslocamento dessas bandas para regiÃes de menor energia, quando comparadas aos ligantes livres, permitiram identificar que os ligantes TCNQ e TCNE encontram-se coordenados em sua forma radicalar (TCNX. â). O grau de transferÃncia de carga (Z) baseado nos espectros de infravermelho para os compostos Ru-TCNQ e Ru-TCNE foi de 0, 66 e 0, 78, respectivamente.

The absorption spectra of the Ru-TCNQ and Ru-TCNE complexes showed bands assigned to metalto-ligand charge transfer transitions (MLCT). The luminescence spectra, with excitation at the MLCT, exhibited emission with maximum of intensity at 570 and 605 nm for the Ru-TCNQ and Ru-TCNE complexes, respectively. The luminescence decay of the complexes follows a biexponential law, with the Ru-TCNQ complex showing shorter lifetime than the Ru-TCNE complex. The infrared vibrational spectra of the complexes show {{a larger number}} of nitrile stretching bands, comparatively to the free ligands of coordination. These suggesting that the TCNX compounds are coordinated to the ruthenium atom. Upon coordenation, the shifts of these bands for lower energy values are indicative of the TCNX reduced form (TCNX&# 8901;â). These results are confirmed by EPR spectra with g = 2. 007 and 2. 010 for Ru-TCNQ and Ru-TCNE complexes, respectively. The degree of charge transfer (Z) for the Ru-TCNQ and Ru-TCNE compounds was evaluated as 0. 66 and 0. 78, respectively.

However, IMRT for prostate patients is not yet standard in many Australian radiation oncology centres. This study investigates dosimetric changes that can be observed between IMRT and 3 DCRT in prostate radiotherapy. Fifteen patients were selected for analysis. Two target definitions were investigated – prostate-only and prostate plus seminal vesicles (p + SVs). A five-field 3 DCRT and seven-field IMRT plan were created for each patient and target definition. The planning target volume coverage was matched for both plans. Doses to the rectum, bladder and femoral heads were compared using dose volume histograms. The rectal normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) were calculated and compared for the 3 DCRT and IMRT plans. The delivery efficiency was investigated. The IMRT plans resulted in reductions in the <b>V</b> 25, <b>V</b> 50, <b>V</b> 60, <b>V</b> <b>70</b> and <b>V</b> 75 Gy values for both the prostate-only and p + SVs targets.

There have been no previous studies comparing attitudes and knowledge of doctors in primary and secondary care towards EBM practice and teaching and this study sets out to investigate this area. We asked participants, a stratified sample of general practitioners, hospital consultants, GP registrars and junior hospital doctors in Leicester, Northamptonshire and Rutland, UK, to complete a self-administered survey questionnaire and written knowledge test which provided ‘positive to evidence based practice’ (PEP) attitude scores and Manchester Short EBM Questionnaire Education for Primary Care (2007) 18 : 45 – 57 # 2007 Radcliffe Publishing Limited WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN IN THIS AREA. There is little evidence on the relationship between attitudes and knowledge in relation to evidence-based medicine (EBM) in family doctors, consultants and doctors intraining. WHAT THIS WORK ADDS. This study showed that, although general practitioners and general practitioner trainers were significantly less positive in attitude to EBM compared to GP registrars, junior hospital doctors and consultant respondents, they had significantly higher knowledge scores. This study demonstrated that the attitude (PEP) score and knowledge questionnaire(MANSEBMQ) have high reliability but require further research to demonstrate validity. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH. There remain opportunities for refinement of the MANSEBMQ, validation against existing tools and further application in a larger study, including assessment of EBM knowledge and skills, before and after an educational process, involving students in clinically relevant and integrated EBM learning.

40|$|Introduction: Late HIV {{diagnosis}} is common and {{associated with an}} increased risk of clinical progression, blunted immune response on antiretroviral (ARV) therapy and higher risk of drug toxicity. Across Europe, {{more than a third of}} patients are diagnosed late and consequently delay medical care. European Consensus definition group identify as late presentation (LP) persons, presenting for care, with a CD 4 count below 350 cell/mm 3 or presenting with AIDS-defining event, regardless of CD 4 cell count. Additionally, advanced HIV disease (AD) is defined by a CD 4 count below 200 cell/mm 3 or an AIDS defining condition in persons presenting to care. Materials and Methods: Retrospective observational study of a cohort of 705 HIV-infected patients diagnosed between 1986 and 2014 and medically followed at an Infectious Diseases Service in Lisbon. Objectives: Evaluate LP rate evolution in the last three decades (10 -year time intervals considered: 1986 – 1995; 1996 – 2005; 2006 – 2014); compare clinic, immunologic, virologic and therapeutic response over time. Identify main reasons responsible for late HIV diagnosis in order to promote optimized intervention strategies. SPSS version 20. 0 was used for statistical analysis. Results: Study included 705 patients HIV diagnosed during 3 time intervals: group A n= 82 [1986 – 1995]; group B n= 332 [1996 – 2005]; group C n= 291 [2006 – 2014].
