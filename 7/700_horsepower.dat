50|$|In 1985, David Jolliffe, Lamborghini's {{official}} British importer, {{attempted to}} run the Lamborghini Countach LP5000S in Group B sports car racing, but was prohibited as the car's production run was insufficient to homologate the car. After the failure of this effort, he instead acquired a 5.7-litre V12 engine based on that used in the Countach QV, and commissioned Luigi Marmiroli to develop the engine for Group C racing. Using lessons learned from Lamborghini's successful marine engines, the Lamborghini factory were able to extract between 650 and <b>700</b> <b>horsepower</b> from the engine, which was then coupled to a Hewland VG-C transmission. Jolliffe commissioned Spice Engineering to build and design the chassis, which then had the modified Countach engine fitted.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this program}} were: to verify the model of off schedule compressor variable geometry in the T 700 turboshaft engine nonlinear model; {{to evaluate the use}} of the pseudo-random binary noise (PRBN) technique for obtaining engine frequency response data; and to design a high performance power turbine speed governor using modern control methods. Reduction of T 700 engine test data generated at NASA-Lewis indicated that the off schedule variable geometry effects were accurate as modeled. Analysis also showed that the PRBN technique combined with the maximum likelihood model identification method produced a Bode frequency response that was as accurate as the response obtained from standard sinewave testing methods. The frequency response verified the accuracy of linear models consisting of engine partial derivatives and used for design. A power turbine governor was designed using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) method of full state feedback control. A Kalman filter observer was used to estimate helicopter main rotor blade velocity. Compared to the baseline T 700 power turbine speed governor, the LQR governor reduced droop up to 25 percent for a 490 shaft horsepower transient in 0. 1 sec simulating a wind gust, and up to 85 percent for a <b>700</b> shaft <b>horsepower</b> transient in 0. 5 sec simulating a large collective pitch angle transient...|$|R
50|$|Driving power {{included}} 11 water turbines with {{a combined}} horsepower of 8,550, and supplementary steam engines of <b>700</b> <b>horsepower</b> were employed. Seventy per cent of the spindles were used in making yarns for sale principally among weavers in the St. Petersburg and Moscow textile districts. A specialty of the mill was 90s ply yarn, made from Egyptian yarn, for the rubber-tire manufacturers. The range of yarns produced was wide, running from 3s to 90s, and about 330,000 of the spindles were mules. The woven textile consisted mainly of print cloth in various types of construction and sateens, both woven from 34s warp and 38s weft. Practically all the goods were shipped to a factory in Moscow, in which the firm had a large interest.|$|E

5000|$|Tracked Stryker: For the Army's Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) {{program to}} replace the M113 APC, General Dynamics created a tracked version of the Stryker. The vehicle kept the highly survivable Double-V hull, and tracks were {{attached}} using externally mounted suspension. It was considerably heavier at 70,000 pounds (35 tons, 31,800 kg), but the tracked suspension could handle up to 84,000 lb (42 tons, 38,100 kg) to allow for additional armor, weapons, and cargo. Its powerplant offered <b>700</b> <b>horsepower</b> and the vehicle had greater than 60 percent commonality with wheeled Strykers. The Tracked Stryker also had greater fuel efficiency and a wider track for better mobility than the M113. With the suspension mounted externally {{and the elimination of}} axles, the Double-V hull's survivability could have been even more effective, as the wheeled version required an interruption in the V-hull to accept axles. The Tracked Stryker was to have competed against the BAE Systems Turretless Bradley, but serious efforts on developing the tracked version never materialized because the cost needed to modify the vehicle to meet requirements was too high.|$|E
50|$|On October 14, 1890 Sherman {{founded the}} Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway in Downtown Los Angeles. He {{received}} a 50-year franchise {{from the city}} and sold stock to help build his street car railroad. In January, 1891 Sherman made is brother-in-law, Eli P. Clark, vice-president and manager of the Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway, the predecessor of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad. The company built 47 miles of track radiating out around from Arcade Depot at 6th and Central Streets in downtown Los Angeles. The new company did well. The power for the street cars came from two Thompson-Corliss type oil steam engines, each with <b>700</b> <b>horsepower,</b> made by Golden State Miners’ Iron Works in San Francisco. Joseph W. Wolfskill sold a lot to the Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway for the Arcade Depot. In 1899 the Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway became part of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad, as steam trains and other rail lines were added to the system. Gen. Sherman purchased land that became the town the bears his name: Sherman Oaks, his land deals made him more money than his railroading.|$|E
5000|$|Years later {{around 2006}} {{a new era}} of Mud Bogging started to evolve and has since grown into a {{worldwide}} internet sensation. In present-day 2016 Mud Parks around the eastern half of the United States have events that draw in thousands of people who bring their Atvs, UTVs, buggies, lifted Jeeps, and Mega Trucks to participate in the act of Mud bogging. Most Mega Trucks are built with a custom chassis, have 5 ton axles, upwards of <b>700</b> <b>horsepower</b> and have tractor tires. Some drivers enter their Mega Truck in freestyle, Hill'n Hole, bounty hole and Tug of War competitions and compete with others for cash and or trophy's. Some Mega Trucks have a blower motor or an Alcohol injected motor that will bring upwards of 1500 horsepower. In order to make competitions fair the trucks can be divided into different classes such as [...] "Mega Truck Class", [...] "1 Ton class" [...] and [...] "Super Truck Class". [...] Videos of Mud Bogging can be found all over YouTube. For example, Mud Stamp Films is a Mud bogging channel that provides footage of Mud Bogging and Mega Trucks at different Mud Parks around the Eastern half of the United States.|$|E
5000|$|NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour {{cars are}} {{substantially}} {{different from their}} Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series counterparts. Today's cars are based on tubular chassis built by fabricators such as Troyer Engineering, Chassis Dynamics, Spafco, Raceworks and Fury Race Cars / LFR Chassis. Bodies are related to their passenger car counterparts in only two ways. There is a [...] "manufacturers" [...] logo placed on the car, and a logo indicating the type of road car it is alleged to be. Neither logo is actually associated with the actual manufacturer of the race vehicle. Whelen Modified cars are also largely fabricated from sheetmetal, with the front wheels {{and much of the}} front suspension exposed. A NASCAR Whelen Modified car is eleven inches shorter in height and over twenty-three inches wider than a Cup car. By rule, tour-type modifieds weigh at least 2610 pounds (with additional weight for engines 358 cubic inches and larger) and have a wheelbase of 107 in. They are powered by small-block V-8 engines, usually of 355 to 368 cubic inches of displacement, although larger or smaller engines can be used. Engine components are largely similar to those used in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, but Whelen Modified Tour engines use a small four-barrel carburetor (rated at 390 cubic feet per minute, about half the airflow of previous modified carburetors), which limits their output to 625 to <b>700</b> <b>horsepower.</b> On large tracks such as New Hampshire Motor Speedway, the engines must have a restrictor plate between the carburetor and intake manifold, reducing engine power and car speed for safety reasons. Approved [...] "body styles" [...] for 2006 include the Chevrolet Cavalier and Monte Carlo, the Dodge Avenger and Stealth, the Ford Mustang and Escort, the Plymouth Laser and Sundance, and the Pontiac Sunbird, J2000, and Grand Prix.|$|E
