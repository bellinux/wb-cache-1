40|$|Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are {{transcription}} {{factors that}} mediate adaptive responses to reduced oxygen availability. HIF-α subunits are stabilized {{under conditions of}} acute hypoxia. However, prolonged hypoxia leads to decay of HIF- 1 α but not HIF- 2 α protein levels by unknown mechanisms. Here, we identify Hsp <b>70</b> and <b>CHIP</b> (carboxyl terminus of Hsc 70 -interacting protein) as HIF- 1 α-interacting proteins. Hsp 70, through recruiting the ubiquitin ligase CHIP, promotes the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF- 1 α but not HIF- 2 α, thereby inhibiting HIF- 1 -dependent gene expression. Disruption of Hsp 70 -CHIP interaction blocks HIF- 1 α degradation mediated by Hsp <b>70</b> and <b>CHIP.</b> Inhibition of Hsp <b>70</b> or <b>CHIP</b> synthesis by RNA interference increases protein levels of HIF- 1 α but not HIF- 2 α and attenuates the decay of HIF- 1 α levels during prolonged hypoxia.

After capturing DENV with the sulfated sugar chain-immobilized gold nanoparticles (SGNPs), the resulting complex is precipitated and viral RNA content is measured using the reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction SYBR Green I (RT-qPCR-Syb) method. Sugar chains that bind to DENVs were identified using the array-type <b>sugar</b> chain immobilized <b>chip</b> (<b>Sugar</b> <b>Chip)</b> and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging. Heparin and low-molecular-weight dextran sulfate were identified as binding partners, and immobilized on gold nanoparticles to prepare 3 types of SGNPs.

As a result, the novel method was able to detect low concentrations of DENVs using only 6 μL of serum, with similar sensitivity to that of a Qiagen RNA extraction kit using 140 μL of serum. In addition, this method allows for multiplex-like identification of serotypes of DENVs.

40|$|The {{molecular}} chaperone, {{heat shock}} protein 70 (Hsp 70), is an important regulator of protein homeostasis that has roles in both primary protein folding and clearance of misfolded proteins. Several {{studies have suggested that}} it is the interaction between Hsp 70 and a network of co-chaperones that might determine the fate Hsp 70 -bound substrates. For example, a complex formed between Hsp 70 and the E 3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP, is thought to guide substrates to the proteasome. However the mechanism governing how co-chaperones assemble on Hsp 70 remains unresolved. We wanted to explore how interactions between Hsp <b>70</b> and <b>CHIP</b> govern the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of chaperone substrates. Moreover, we hypothesize that chemical disruption of the Hsp <b>70</b> - <b>CHIP</b> contact might decrease turnover of these substrates and, thereby, alter protein homeostasis. This thesis work involves the biophysical and structural characterization of the Hsp 70 -CHIP complex and synthesis of chemical probes that block CHIP binding to Hsp 70. Using truncations and biochemical assays, we determined that the xvi tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of CHIP, along with an important secondary interaction in the charged coiled-coil domain govern binding of <b>CHIP</b> to Hsp <b>70.</b> In addition, we developed a dramatically improved synthesis of the promising natural product, spergualin, and created a collection of more potent and stable derivatives. We then showed that these compounds disrupt the Hsp 70 -CHIP interaction in vitro and in cells. Together, these findings provide a quantitative exploration of the CHIP-Hsp 70 complex and the first set of chemical tools {{that can be used to}} regulate Hsp <b>70</b> interactions with <b>CHIP.</b> We expect that these probes will be useful in further studying Hsp 70 -mediated protein quality control...|$|R

In the 70 ’s, the advent of mainframe computers broadened the scope to include commercial applications. In parallel, large-scale circuit integration allowed exponential increases in computing power (Moore’s law). In the 80 ’s, the convergence between information technologies and telecommunications opened the way for the Internet, the Web and the Information Society. In the 90 ’s, another very important, but less visible, revolution started with the dissemination of embedded systems technologies. More than 95 % of the chips produced today are for embedded applications. These are electronic components integrating software and hardware jointly and specifically designed to provide given functionalities, which are often critical. They are hidden in devices, appliances and equipment of any kind: mobile phones, cameras, home appliances, cars, aircraft, trains, medical devices etc. In 2008, the average person used about 230 embedded chips every day: 80 chips in home appliances, 40 <b>chips</b> at work, <b>70</b> <b>chips</b> in cars, 40 chips in portable devices.

40|$|A {{group of}} tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) -containing {{proteins}} {{has been shown}} to interact with the C-terminal domain of the 70 kDa heat-shock cognate protein (hsc 70). In the present study, the effect of the TPR-containing proteins, including the C-terminus of hsc <b>70</b> -interacting protein (<b>CHIP),</b> TPR 1 and human glutamine-rich TPR-containing protein (hSGT), on refolding of luciferase by DnaJ and hsc 70 was investigated. These proteins inhibited the restoration of luciferase activity by the chaperones. The inhibitory effect exerted by TPR 1 and hSGT depended upon their binding to hsc 70. However, the interaction with hsc 70 {{did not appear to be}} required for the inhibition of luciferase refolding by CHIP. We also demonstrate that the peptide, GPTIEEVD, corresponding to the C-terminal end of hsc 70, abolished the association of [(3) H]hsc <b>70</b> with <b>CHIP,</b> TPR 1 and hSGT. This implied that the GPTIEEVD motif of hsc 70 was responsible for interacting with these TPR-containing proteins. However, the GGXP-repeats (where X is any aliphatic residue), another C-terminal conserved motif of vertebrate hsc 70 s, were not essential for interacting with the TPR-containing proteins. On the basis of mutagenesis studies, it was clear that a unique combination of the functional groups in the GPTIEEVD motif were utilized to interact with each TPR-containing protein, suggesting that inhibitors can be designed and used to elucidate the functional role of these interactions...|$|R
40|$|The E 3 {{ubiquitin}} ligase CHIP {{is involved}} in protein triage, serving as a co-chaperone for refolding as well as catalyzing ubiquitination of substrates. CHIP functions with both the stress induced Hsp 70 and constitutive Hsc 70 chaperones, and also {{plays a role in}} maintaining their balance in the cell. When the chaperones carry no client proteins, CHIP catalyzes their polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Although Hsp 70 and Hsc 70 are highly homologous in sequence and similar in structure, CHIP mediated ubiquitination promotes degradation of Hsp 70 with a higher efficiency than for Hsc 70. Here we report a detailed and systematic investigation to characterize if there are significant differences in the CHIP in vitro ubiquitination of human Hsp 70 and Hsc 70. Proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that only 12 of 39 detectable lysine residues were ubiquitinated by UbcH 5 a in Hsp 70 and only 16 of 45 in Hsc 70. The only conserved lysine identified as ubiquitinated in one but not the other heat shock protein was K 159 in Hsc 70. Ubiquitination assays with K-R ubiquitin mutants showed that multiple Ub chain types are formed and that the distribution is different for Hsp 70 versus Hsc <b>70.</b> <b>CHIP</b> ubiquitination with the E 2 enzyme Ube 2 W is predominantly directed to the N-terminal amine of the substrate; however, some internal lysine modifications were also detected.

The Dolphins could only gain 3 yards with their next three plays, and Washington ended up getting the ball back with great field position on their own 48-yard line. The Redskins ran three plays to reach Miami's 43-yard line, but then faced a fourth down and one to go. Instead of punting, the Redskins decided to gamble and attempt to get the first down with a run from Riggins. But Riggins did a lot more than pick up the first down. Coach Joe Gibbs called his trademark play I-Right <b>70</b> <b>Chip,</b> starting tight end Clint Didier in motion towards the right, then reversing motion back to the left. Theismann handed to Riggins, who broke a tackle from Miami cornerback Don McNeal and still managed to build up enough speed to outrun defensive back Glenn Blackwood as he took off for a 43-yard touchdown run, giving Washington their first lead of the game, 20-17, with a little more than 10 minutes remaining in the game. McNeal, who was assigned to cover Didier on the play, slipped briefly as Didier changed direction. The Redskins ran the play to the left, behind Didier and fullback Otis Wonsley, and Riggins ran over McNeal to score the touchdown. Although McNeal did indeed slip briefly while following Didier across the formation, it would have made little difference in the outcome of the play. Despite a valiant effort by McNeal, the 185-pound cornerback could do little more than hold on briefly as he met the 240-pound Riggins running with a full head of steam, hit him high, and slid down his body as [...] "The Diesel" [...] pulled away towards the end zone and the Redskins' first Super Bowl victory.|$|R
