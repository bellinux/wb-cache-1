40|$|Though {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the Internet has created a fertile ground for legal innovation, {{more often than not}} legislators and courts have sought to address this relatively new medium by attempting to squeeze it into precedents and paradigms better suited to older forms of communication, technology, and media. Part I of this article looks back at the courts 2 ̆ 7 initial efforts at addressing defamation via the Internet. From the start the courts attempted to fit the role of the ISP into the common law 2 ̆ 7 s categorizing of print media as either 2 ̆ 2 publishers 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 distributors 2 ̆ 2 of information. One court 2 ̆ 7 s misstep in overextending the liability of one ISP to that of a publisher led Congress to sweep ISP liability into the CDA in an attempt to give ISPs more tools to regulate content they consider offensive. Part I then {{takes a look at the}} most recent major Internet defamation case, Blumenthal v. Drudge, and how it cemented the current regime, which interprets Congress 2 ̆ 7 s prohibition of ISP liability for 2 ̆ 2 publishers 2 ̆ 2 as a prohibition against virtually all liability and not a narrowing of ISP liability to that of a 2 ̆ 2 distributor. 2 ̆ 2 The potential ramifications for allowing ISPs to be liable as 2 ̆ 2 distributors 2 ̆ 2 of third party defamatory content are addressed in Part III. In particular, the section focuses on whether a notice-based liability regime could function on the Internet without either compromising the medium 2 ̆ 7 s main advantages or chilling free speech. Part IV takes into account these same concerns while arguing for a narrow application of 2 ̆ <b>2</b> <b>publisher</b> 2 ̆ 2 liability to those few ISPs that fulfill a content-providing role akin to that of a publisher of a newspaper or magazine. By examining the Drudge case directly, this comment demonstrates how traditional safeguards in defamation law like the 2 ̆ 2 actual malice 2 ̆ 2 standard for public figures will severely limit the chances of these ISPs to fall victim to unwarranted liability, and that a federal exemption from 2 ̆ <b>2</b> <b>publisher</b> 2 ̆ 2 liability for ISPs was never really necessary. Defamation law is one field where Congress could effectively legislate a federal standard based on prior precedents with minor tweaking without taking the sledgehammer tactic of providing blanket immunity to those who provide access to the defamers of tomorrow. A federal standard is necessary due to the unique jurisdictional concerns of the Internet that are examined in Part V. Congress should reform the CDA to create a more even playing field between Internet media providers and broadcast and print media providers so that the former (just as much as the latter) may be found liable as 2 ̆ 2 distributors 2 ̆ 2 when they fall to remove defamatory content of which they are aware. In addition, if an ISP commissions and edits information content in a manner analogous to newspaper or book publishers, it should be held to the stricter 2 ̆ <b>2</b> <b>publisher</b> 2 ̆ 2 standard of fault as well...|$|E

The response of the marine carbon cycle to changes in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations will be determined, in part, by the relative response of calcifying and non-calcifying organisms to global change. Planktonic foraminifera are responsible for a quarter or more of global carbonate production, therefore understanding the sensitivity of calcification in these organisms to environmental change is critical. Despite this, there remains little consensus as to whether, or to what extent, chemical and physical factors affect foraminiferal calcification. To address this, we directly test the effect of multiple controls on calcification in culture experiments and core-top measurements of Globigerinoides ruber. We find that two factors, body size and the carbonate system, strongly influence calcification intensity in life, but that exposure to corrosive bottom waters can overprint this signal post mortem. Using a simple model for the addition of calcite through ontogeny, we show that variable body size between and within datasets could complicate studies that examine environmental controls on foraminiferal shell weight. In addition, we suggest that size could ultimately {{play a role in}} determining whether calcification will increase or decrease with acidification. Our models highlight that knowledge of the specific morphological and physiological mechanisms driving ontogenetic change in calcification in different species will be critical in predicting the of foraminiferal calcification to future change in atmospheric pCO <b>2.</b> <b>Publisher</b> PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E

We describe a combined experimental and computational study into the scope, regioselectivity, and mechanism of the catalytic hydrodefluorination (HDF) of fluoropyridines, C 5 F 5 ?xHxN (x = 0 ? 2), at two Ru(NHC) (PPh 3) 2 (CO) H 2 catalysts (NHC = IPr, 1, and IMes, 2). The regioselectivity and extent of HDF is significantly dependent {{on the nature of}} the NHC: with 1 HDF of C 5 F 5 N is favored at the ortho-position and gives 2, 3, 4, 5 -C 5 F 4 HN as the major product. This reacts on to 3, 4, 5 -C 5 F 3 H 2 N and 2, 3, 5 -C 5 F 3 H 2 N, and the latter can also undergo further HDF to 3, 5 -C 5 F 2 H 3 N and 2, 5 -C 5 F 2 H 3 N. para-HDF of C 5 F 5 N is also seen and gives 2, 3, 5, 6 -C 5 F 4 HN as a minor product, which is then inert to further reaction. In contrast, with 2, para-HDF of C 5 F 5 N is preferred, and moreover, the 2, 3, 5, 6 -C 5 F 4 HN regioisomer undergoes C?H bond activation to form the catalytically inactive 16 e Ru-fluoropyridyl complex Ru(IMes) (PPh 3) (CO) (4 -C 5 F 4 N) H, 3. Density functional theory calculations rationalize the different regioselectivity of HDF of C 5 F 5 N at 1 and 2 in terms of a change in the pathway that is operating with these two catalysts. With 1, a stepwise mechanism is favored in which a N ? Ru σ-interaction stabilizes the key C?F bond cleavage along the ortho-HDF pathway. With 2, a concerted pathway favoring para-HDF is more accessible. The calculations show the barriers increase for the subsequent HDF of the lower fluorinated substrates, and they also correctly identify the most reactive C?F bonds. A mechanism for the formation of 3 is also defined, but the competition between C?H bond activation and HDF of 2, 3, 5, 6 -C 5 F 4 HN at 2 (which favors C?H activation experimentally) is not reproduced. In general, the calculations appear to overestimate the HDF reactivity of 2, 3, 5, 6 -C 5 F 4 HN at both catalysts 1 and <b>2.</b> <b>Publisher</b> PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E

The Hemington Bridges formed an important medieval crossing point over the River Trent, carrying the King’s Highway linking Leicester {{and the south}} to Derby and northern England. This report {{presents the results of}} the excavations and multi-disciplinary investigations of three successive bridges found during quarrying operations between 1993 – 1998, and places the structures in their technological, geomorphological, environmental and historical contexts. The earliest bridge at Hemington, Bridge I, was constructed in the late 11 th century and rebuilt in the early 12 th century following a calamitous flood. It is the most complete Saxo-Norman timber structure found in Britain and presents unique evidence for vernacular timber working in this period, as well as providing significant information regarding early bridge design and construction techniques. The late 11 th-century phase comprised two timber caisson pier bases and a trestle spanning part of a braided channel. The caisson pier bases were large, lozenge-shaped, jointed wooden boxes filled with sandstone rubble, positioned in the river bed, the long axes parallel to the flow. These served as plinths, supporting a superstructure that elevated the decking. The span between the piers was approximately 10 m, with the trestle providing a mid-pier support. The trestle provides some important evidence for the superstructure showing that the bridge decking was 2. 8 m wide, so suitable for carts, and was carried 5. 5 m above the river bed. It is notable that there are joints preserved in the trestle that have no known parallels. This phase of the bridge was short-lived with evident undermining of the foundations by deep scouring, probably during severe flood conditions. One caisson had rotated laterally by some 808 and the second had tilted from the horizontal by 408. Both had settled into deep scour features, and the trestle had collapsed over one of the caissons. Coarse deposits quickly buried the remains. Sometime after 1111, the bridge, or at least this section, was rebuilt. The second phase of construction comprised a double row of irregularly spaced oak piles with lateral bracing, each pair 2. 90 m apart, spanning 27 m of river channel. Some pairs had supplementary posts, presumably added as alterations or repairs. All the posts had rotted off above the height of the modern water table and consequently no jointing survived to suggest how these posts articulated with the bridge decking. These remains too were buried by coarse, point bar deposits as the river migrated laterally to the south, scouring away the southern bridgehead. The exact timescale for these channel changes is uncertain, but the establishment of Bridge II in the late 12 th century suggests that it should be measured in decades. Bridge II was located upstream from its predecessor, and comprised a double row of piled posts with lateral bracing. This was probably constructed in the late 12 th century and had been maintained into the 13 th century, suggesting that Bridge III was its direct replacement. Bridge III was constructed in the mid 13 th century immediately upstream from Bridge II. The first part of the bridge, found in 1993, comprised the foundations of four regularly spaced piers crossing a 50 m section of an old course of the Trent. Two different foundation techniques were employed for the piers: those closest to the northern bank were of masonry, constructed directly on the river bed. The two mid-stream piers were hexagonal enclosures of deeply driven piles infilled with sandstone rubble, forming a foundation for a masonry pier, the collapsed remains of which were located on the river bed and in scour features downstream. Associated timber structures included three or possibly four inter-pier structures, probably supports for a timber superstructure, and a baffle located in front of the mid-stream piers. The piers and baffle were constructed from timber felled in the late 1230 s and early 1240 s. Further structural activity or maintenance is shown by the presence of a timber felled c. 1270 – 1305 in one of the inter-pier structures. The southern abutment of the bridge was revealed in further quarry work in 1998. A corresponding, but unrecognised, northern abutment was probably observed during quarrying in 1991 – <b>2.</b> <b>Publisher</b> Versio...|$|E
