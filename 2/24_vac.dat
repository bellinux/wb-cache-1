5000|$|... 1 A separate, {{continuous}} source of 24 volts alternating current (<b>24</b> <b>VAC)</b> is {{provided to the}} thermostat.|$|E
5000|$|A {{sophisticated}} {{power circuit}} operates from the <b>24</b> <b>VAC</b> supply when the thermostat is not calling, and operates {{from the current}} flowing in the thermostat circuit when the thermostat is calling. A battery is used to provide back-up during power failures.|$|E
5000|$|... 2 A {{rechargeable}} battery in the thermostat operates the clock. This battery charges when the thermostat is not calling for heat and <b>24</b> <b>VAC</b> {{is available to}} it. It discharges to operate the clock when the thermostat is set for heating or cooling.|$|E
5000|$|A non-rechargeable battery always powers the thermostat. To {{limit the}} amount of power drawn from the battery, such {{thermostats}} use an impulse relay that does not require the continuous application of power to the relay's coil. These thermostats can be used on millivolt circuits, as well as conventional <b>24</b> <b>VAC</b> circuits. Battery life is typically one to two years.|$|E
50|$|Volts {{center tapped}} (VCT) {{describes}} the voltage output of a center tapped transformer. For example: A 24 VCT transformer will measure <b>24</b> <b>VAC</b> across the outer two taps (winding as a whole), and 12 VAC from each outer tap to the center-tap (half winding). These two 12 VAC supplies are 180 degrees {{out of phase}} with each other, thus {{making it easy to}} derive positive and negative 12 volt DC power supplies from them.|$|E
5000|$|Power {{consumption}} and supply {{requirements of the}} solenoid vary with application, being primarily determined by fluid pressure and line diameter. For example, a popular 3/4" [...] 150 psi sprinkler valve, intended for <b>24</b> <b>VAC</b> (50 - 60 Hz) residential systems, has a momentary inrush of 7.2 VA, and a holding power requirement of 4.6 VA. Comparatively, an industrial 1/2" [...] 10000 psi valve, intended for 12, 24, or 120 VAC systems in high pressure fluid and cryogenic applications, has an inrush of 300 VA and a holding power of 22 VA. Neither valve lists a minimum pressure required to remain closed in the un-powered state.|$|E
40|$|In {{method of}} {{measuring}} bulk {{modulus of elasticity}} of elastomeric material, piezoelectric crystals of various sizes and energized by alternating voltage embedded in material. Concept demonstrated in test cell in which piezoelectric crystal mounted either unconstrained or between two rubber pads and connected as actuator in loud-speaker. The 1 -in. diameter crystal excited with <b>24</b> <b>Vac</b> at 60 Hz. When crystal was unconstrained, it drew current of 0. 8 mA. When crystal was constrained between rubber pads, current fell to 0. 65 mA. Low current, minimal heating, and absence of arcing makes technique suitable for measurement of bulk moduli of elasticity of flammable or explosive rubbery materials...|$|E
40|$|Main {{objective}} is to design and implement automated control circuit to switch ON & OFF main power feeding contactor of industrial welding transformer, depend on the work pattern. Voltage sensing at the out put terminals of secondary winding of welding transformer {{is used as a}} one and only input signal for the control circuit. Reduced voltage <b>24</b> <b>VAC</b> is supplied to primary during idling and during operation it converts in to 400 VAC, and this conversion takes place automatically. By that, able to reduce idling power loss on primary winding due to open circuit core loss & iron loss. During designing of new system special attention was made, not to change existing conventional welding procedure and not to introduce additional external sensors and cables other than conventional welding electrode and welding cable. New system was practically implemented in yard and tested for long period of time in different work conditions in Colombo Dockyard PLC. System was tested with existing conventional welders but no behavioral changes were observed during welding operation after implementing new system. Successful trails were carried out and proved it uninterrupt operation. Under guidance and instructions of my project supervisor I worked and finally able to came up with practically feasible solution. This report describes problem identification, how the design concept developed, power saving and cost benefits. to yard after implementation of new system. The report starts with an introduction as a 1 st chapter where describe the current welding practice at Colombo Dockyard PLC, how to reduce idling power loss by implementing new method and final goal of my project. 2 nd chapter describes the statement of the problem and problem identification, new solution and how it affects to save energy. The 3 rd chapter consists with gathered technical data and its analysis during execution of design approach. Next 4 th chapter describe about proposed and implemented solutions for the identified problem and evolution of design concept. Fifth chapter describes the energy saving calculations and cost benefit analysis. Finally, in the conclusion, I have explained practically and economically viability of new product as a industrial product...|$|E
