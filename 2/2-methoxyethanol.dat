50|$|Mixed ligand carbonyls of ruthenium, osmium, rhodium, and iridium {{are often}} {{generated}} by abstraction of CO from solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF) and <b>2-methoxyethanol.</b> Typical is {{the synthesis of}} IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2 from the reaction of iridium(III) chloride and triphenylphosphine in boiling DMF solution.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, β-hydride {{elimination}} is {{the first}} in a series of steps. For instance in the synthesis of RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 from ruthenium trichloride, triphenylphosphine and <b>2-methoxyethanol,</b> an intermediate alkoxide complex undergoes a β-hydride elimination to form the hydride ligand and the pi-bonded aldehyde which then is later converted into the carbonyl (carbon monoxide) ligand.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>2-Methoxyethanol</b> {{is used as}} {{a solvent}} for many {{different}} purposes such as varnishes, dyes, and resins. It is also used as an additive in airplane deicing solutions. In organometallic chemistry it is commonly used for the synthesis of Vaska's complex and related compounds such as carbonylchlorohydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium (II). During these reactions the alcohol acts as a source of hydride and carbon monoxide.|$|E
50|$|Sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminumhydride (trade names Red-Al, Synhydrid, Vitride) is an organoaluminium {{compound}} {{with the}} formula NaAlH2(OCH2CH2OCH3)2. The trade name Red-Al refers to its being a reducing aluminium compound. It is used predominantly as a reducing agent in organic synthesis. The compound features a tetrahedral aluminium center attached to two hydride and two alkoxide groups, the latter derived from <b>2-methoxyethanol.</b> Commercial solutions are colourless/pale yellow and viscous. At low temperatures, the solution solidifies to a glassy pulverizable substance. No {{sharp melting point}} was found.|$|E

It can be formed by the nucleophilic attack of methanol on protonated oxirane followed by proton transfer: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{synthesis}} involves heating {{virtually any}} iridium chloride salt with triphenylphosphine and a carbon monoxide source. The most popular method uses dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent, and sometimes aniline {{is added to}} accelerate the reaction. Another popular solvent is <b>2-methoxyethanol.</b> The reaction is typically conducted under nitrogen. In the synthesis, triphenylphosphine serves as both a ligand and a reductant, and the carbonyl ligand is derived by decomposition of dimethylformamide, probably via a deinsertion of an intermediate Ir-C(O)H species. The following is a possible balanced equation for this complicated reaction.|$|E
