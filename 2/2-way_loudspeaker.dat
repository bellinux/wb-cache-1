50|$|In 2007, other {{implementations}} of patent-pending technologies came {{to fruition}} {{in the form}} of the MBM-12 (Mid-Bass Module), the VTF MK 3 line, and the HB-1 (Horn Bookshelf), HC-1 (Horn Center) horn-based loudspeakers. The HB-1 <b>2-way</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> uses a constant-directivity horn, which provides a uniform off-axis response, offering accurate imaging and soundstage reproduction.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first years}} of the 21st century {{presented}} challenges. Genelec introduced the LSE-series of subwoofers and replaced most of the 2-way series with the new 8000 Series. The 8000 Series comprises four models (8020B, 8030A, 8040A and 8050A 2-way Active Loudspeakers), some of which are clearly smaller than their predecessors, which was obtained by using aluminium as the material of the speaker enclosures instead of traditional MDF. Renowned Finnish industrial designer Harri Koskinen designed the 8000 Series' appearance. [...] Adding to the series are the smallest 6010A <b>2-way</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> and its supporting 5040A Active Subwoofer, introduced in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Preceding the 3/5A, KEF's Cresta (1967), KEFKIT4 (1969), Cresta II (1970), Coda (1971) {{were all}} <b>2-way</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> that used the B110/T27 combination. KEF {{released}} its CS1 constructor kit (1981) {{to tap the}} home-build market. According to the product brochure, the kit includes [...] "the same KEF drive units originally specified for the LS3/5A with a somewhat simplified dividing network giving a similar overall frequency response characteristic".|$|R

5000|$|For years, Gunness {{had been}} looking for various {{electronic}} solutions to the undesirable characteristics of horns. At EV in 1985, Gunness noticed the performance differences between various shapes of horns, and theorized that an electronic filter might allow optimization. In early 1995, EV gained access to Altec Lansing's 1987 Acousta-CADD acoustic modeling software which revealed more loudspeaker performance characteristics than had previously been observed, but DSP programming tools were still inadequate for audio signal correction. In 2000, Greek electroacousticians John Mourjopoulos and Panagiotis 'Panos' Hatziantoniou described a method for smoothing precise audio analysis filters. Building on this work, Gunness led a team of EAW engineers to develop a proprietary wavelet transform spectrogram for internal research. The EAW spectrogram reduced visual complexity by applying a zero-phase-shift low-pass filter to the audio signal under test using mirror-image infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. The spectrogram revealed loudspeaker performance anomalies, allowing the engineering team to identify mechanisms they characterized as [...] "two-port systems"; i.e. mechanisms demonstrating a single input, a single transfer function, and a single output. Such two-port systems were of interest because they could possibly be corrected with electronic filtering. Because of their variability the methodology would not be used on any of the mechanisms which appeared to be non-linear relative to signal level, spatial distribution ("coverage"), or over time, such as cone stiffness or surround compliance. This left several substantial [...] "linear, time-invariant" [...] (LTI) mechanisms that would yield to correction by digital filtering. These included 1) time-smear from the compression driver/phase plug interface, 2) horn resonance, 3) cone resonance, and 4) crossover phase linearity between adjacent bandpasses. In April 2005, EAW announced the NT Series, a line of <b>2-way</b> bi-amplified self-powered <b>loudspeakers</b> incorporating the [...] "new technology" [...] which was initially called [...] "Digital Transduction Correction" [...] (DTC). Mix magazine quoted Gunness identifying compression driver [...] "time smear" [...] as a longstanding loudspeaker problem that was countered by preconditioning in the audio signal. Later that year, EAW dropped the DTC acronym and began promoting the technology as [...] "Gunness Focusing".|$|R
