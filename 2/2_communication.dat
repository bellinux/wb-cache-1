30|$|The {{application}} of device-to-device (D <b>2</b> D) <b>communication</b> in cellular networks can significantly improve {{the efficiency of}} spectrum utilization, which benefits local area cooperative services. On the other hand, network coding can realize more efficient cooperation among cellular users. Thus, it is natural to combine network coding with D <b>2</b> D <b>communication</b> {{in order to further}} increase the system sum rate. In this paper, a coalitional graph game framework is proposed to jointly accomplish resource allocation and relay selection, two challenging problems in network coding-aided D <b>2</b> D <b>communication</b> networks. It is shown that this framework can model D <b>2</b> D <b>communication</b> combined with various network coding schemes. Based on the coalitional graph game framework, a distributed algorithm with low computational complexity is proposed to solve the formulated problem for physical layer network coding-aided D <b>2</b> D <b>communication.</b> Finally, the performance of the proposed transmission scheme is evaluated through extensive simulations.|$|R

D <b>2</b> D <b>communication</b> can use either one-hop transmission (i. e., in D <b>2</b> D direct <b>communication)</b> or multi-hop cluster-based transmission (i. e., in D 2 D local area networks).
