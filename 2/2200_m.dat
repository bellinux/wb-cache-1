25|$|This slug mainly {{lives in}} secondary, anthropogenous (man-made) habitats, such as farmland. The habitat of Tandonia budapestensis {{includes}} parks, gardens, ruins and cultivated fields. It lives as a synanthrope. It occur in natural environments in Britain only where human disturbance is involved.

25|$|After being mobilised for war {{service on}} 15 December 1941, the {{regiment}} {{was moved to}} Sydney, entraining at Oakbank on 25 December 1941. Embarking on the transport Aquitania at Woolloomooloo two days later, the regiment sailed for New Guinea. Initially they {{were used in the}} garrison role, but after the Japanese landed in New Guinea, the regiment became involved in the fighting. During the Battle of Buna–Gona which took place in late 1942 and early 1943, the regiment deployed a troop of four guns under command of Captain N.R. Stokes. These were QF 4.5-inch howitzers. Two of these guns were flown to Dobodura on 20 December. Two were transported by sea and landed at Hariko on 23 December. The troop was initially positioned on the Dobodura–Buna track. This was about 2,500 yards (<b>2,200</b> <b>m)</b> south of the bridge between the two strips. The troop fired in support of the US 32nd Division during fighting at Buna. The troop later moved to a position near Giropa Point to support the Allied attacks to take the final Japanese positions at Sanananda and Giruwa.|$|E

30|$|Stimuli for {{the visual}} {{short-term}} memory task were displayed within a 14.4 × 14.4 degree region {{at the center of}} the tablet screen. These stimuli consisted of colored squares (0.67 degrees), separated by a minimum edge-to-edge distance of 0.54 degrees, on a gray background. Squares were randomly assigned the colors green, magenta, red, yellow, blue, white, and black. The display was organized in an invisible 6 × 6 grid with a total of 36 possible locations in which squares could appear. Targets (squares that changed color) could only appear in each location once during a block, producing a total of 36 ‘change’ and 36 ‘no-change’ trials. When a square changed color, the new color was randomly selected from a list of possible colors excluding the current color. Set sizes (number of squares on the screen) of 8 and 12 were used. Trials began with an 800 ms fixation, followed by a 200 ms blank display. Then the memory set appeared for 250 ms, followed by a 900 ms delay period, and finally the test display for <b>2200</b> <b>ms.</b> Participants made their response during the test display and trials timed out if they took longer than <b>2200</b> <b>ms</b> to respond. About 1.4 % of all responses were not made within this response window, with these responses being distributed equally across conditions.|$|R

25|$|T-72B3 (Ob'yekt 184-M3): this upgrade was {{initiated}} in 2010 using old stocks of T-72B tanks held in reserve. In addition to performing a general overhaul of every vehicle, certain tanks were {{equipped with the}} more powerful V-92S2 engines, a new steering system in the driver's compartment and older tracks were replaced with the new universal, twin-pin design. The upgrade program focuses instead on improving the tank's firepower, mainly through {{the implementation of the}} Kalina fire control system, albeit in a simplified form. The tank commander retains an upgraded version of the legacy TKN-3MK sight, which is a passive device with a range of only 600 m at night, but is augmented with a monitor that displays thermal imagery from the gunner's main sight. The commander also has a new turret control panel. The gunner still has the 1A40-4 FCS with 1K13-49 sight, but these are now part of the auxiliary sighting system to complement the new PNM Sosna-U panoramic multi-spectral sensor, which replaced the TPN-3-49 in its mounting. The Sosna-U is a multi-channel, panoramic sight stabilized in both vertical and horizontal axes with a built-in laser rangefinder and command guidance module used with 9M119M missiles. The most advantageous aspect of the Sosna-U is the Thales Catherine-FC thermal imager which extends the detection and identification range of a tank-sized target to 10,500 m and <b>2,200</b> <b>m</b> respectively, at night/day and in all weather combat conditions. The T-72B3 series vehicles also received the new 2A46M5 main gun which has a dispersion value significantly lower than previous generations, and reportedly equivalent to the Rheinmetall Rh120 L/44 cannon. The gun laying and stabilization drives were also replaced with the new 2E42-4 system and the AZ ammunition auto-loader was appropriately modified to accommodate newer generations of long-rod (up to 730mm) saboted kinetic energy anti-tank ammunition: the Svinets-1 (using a depleted uranium penetrator) and Svinets-2 (sintered tungsten alloy) rounds, which were fielded in 2002 and reportedly capable of defeating 740–800mm and 660–740mm of RHA at 2,000 m respectively. Only the most recent T-72B3 tanks however feature this capability. Furthermore, the B3 upgrade includes a new explosion and fire suppression system, as well as an advanced VHF radio system designated R-168-25U-2 AKVEDUK. Entered service on 19 October 2012. First delivered to the 20th Field Army in summer 2013 and its Armored Guards Brigade in October 2013. More than 1,000 such tanks are currently in service.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss the}} results of Vicario (2011, Perception 2011, 40, 23 - 29), {{in the light of}} an {{experiment}} designed to bypass some of the limits of that study. There, participants were asked to perform a temporal bisection on numerical stimuli (small or large digits) presented either for 700 / 900 ms or 2000 / <b>2200</b> <b>ms.</b> For the two longest durations only, bisections of larger digits occurred later than those of smaller digits. Here, subjects judged the temporal position of a flick occurring during the visual presentation of a digit (1, 5, or 9) which lasted on the screen for either 700 ms or 2000 ms. Results revealed no difference in the perceived temporal midpoints of large compared to small digits. In contrast, they showed a response bias: only with the shortest-duration stimuli the digit's magnitude affected the subject's response...|$|R
