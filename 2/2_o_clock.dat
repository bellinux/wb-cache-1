40|$|D <b>2</b> <b>O</b> is {{the only}} “chemical” agent that {{consistently}} affects the frequency of circadian oscillations: its effect is now known to be so widespread and predictable that its action merits closer study as a potential clue to the currently obscure concrete nature of circadian oscillators. The great diversity of D <b>2</b> <b>O</b> effects on biological systems in general is briefly reviewed {{and the need for}} rejectable hypotheses concerning the action of D <b>2</b> <b>O</b> on circadian <b>clocks</b> is stressed because current speculation on its action yields “predictions” expected from almost any hypothesis. We consider the hypothesis that it “diminishes the apparent temperature” of the cell and proceed to test this by examining the effect of D <b>2</b> <b>O</b> on temperature-dependent and temperature-compensated aspects of the circadian system in Drosophila. We find these components respond as differentially to D <b>2</b> <b>O</b> as they do to temperature; we conclude, however, with a warning that this result may be equivocal if, as we now suspect, the frequency of circadian oscillations is generally homeostatically conserved—not only in the face of temperature change, but change in any variable to which it is sensitive. More crucial tests of the temperature-equivalence hypothesis for D <b>2</b> <b>O</b> action are defined...|$|R

50|$|The second Rubin {{maneuver}} {{is performed}} by inserting one hand vaginally behind the posterior aspect of anterior {{shoulder of the}} foetus and rotating the shoulder towards the chest of the foetus, shifting it from the midline (12 <b>o</b> <b>clock)</b> to 11 <b>o</b> <b>clock</b> or 1 <b>o</b> <b>clock</b> position. As a result, the foetal shoulder girdle is adducted and the diameter is reduced. The second Rubin maneuver is more successful if it is combined with suprapubic pressure to facilitate vaginal rotation. This maneuver is painful and difficult for an unanesthetized mother. For primipara, an episiotomy may be performed before inserting the vaginal hand. The reverse Wood's screw maneuver {{is the same as}} second Rubin maneuver except that it is performed on posterior shoulder and the rotation happens on an oblique plane.|$|R

In this work, nanoseconds (193, 266  nm) and femtosecond (800  nm) laser ablation were used to study the elemental composition of Corning glasses using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The determined concentrations of 26 oxides (Li <b>2</b> <b>O,</b> B <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3, Na <b>2</b> <b>O,</b> MgO, Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3, SiO <b>2,</b> P <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 5, K <b>2</b> <b>O,</b> CaO, TiO <b>2,</b> V <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 5, Cr <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3, MnO, Fe <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3, CoO, NiO, CuO, ZnO, Rb <b>2</b> <b>O,</b> SrO, ZrO <b>2,</b> SnO <b>2,</b> Sb <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 5, BaO, PbO, Bi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3) are compared with values reported in the literature. Results show variable discrepancies between the data, with the largest differences found for Cr <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 in Corning A; Li <b>2</b> <b>O,</b> B <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3, and Cr <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 in Corning B; and MnO, Sb <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 5, Cr <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3, and Bi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 in Corning C. The best agreement between the measured and literature values was found for Corning D. However, even for this reference, glass re-evaluation of the data was necessary and new values for PbO, BaO, and Bi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 are proposed...|$|R

40|$|The {{crystallization}} {{characteristics of}} glasses based on lithium iron silicate (LiFeSi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 6) -diopside (CaMgSi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 6) composition with addition of Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 {{at the expense}} of Fe <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 were described. The effect of LiInSi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 6 /CaMgSi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 6 replacements was also investigated. The thermal treatment, the crystal phases, and the micro-structural properties of (LiFeSi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 6 –CaMgSi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 6) glasses, replacing partial Fe <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 with Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 and partial CaMgSi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 6 with LiInSi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 6, have been studied by a differential thermal analysis, an X-ray diffraction, and a scanning electron microscopy. The glasses show the intense uniform bulkcrystallization with the fine grained microstructure by increasing the replacement of Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 /Fe <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 and LiInSi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 6 /CaMgSi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 6. The crystallizing phases of Ca(Fe,Mg) (SiO 3) <b>2,</b> a-LiFe 5 <b>O</b> 8, Li <b>2</b> SiO 3, a-SiO 2 and CaMgSi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 6 are mostly formed together, in most case, with Li 0. 6 Al 0. 6 Si <b>2.</b> 4 <b>O</b> 6, β-eucryptite solid solution, LiInSi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 6, In <b>2</b> Si <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 7, and LiFeSi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 6. The Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 partial replacement increases the transformation temperature (Tg) and softening one (Ts) for the glasses and the glass-ceramics, and decreases the thermal expansion coefficient (a-value) for the glasses. The LiInSi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 6 partial replacement decreases Tg and Ts and increases the a-value for the glasses, while the Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 and LiInSi <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 6 partial replacements decrease the a-value for the glassceramics. The crystallization characters of the glasses are correlated to the internal structure, as well as role played by the glass-forming cations. However, the one of the glass-ceramics are mainly attributed to the crystalline phases formed in the material...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{mathematical}} model on activities of CaO-based slag {{system has been}} established on the bases of ion-molecule coexistence theory of melted slag structure. The activities of CaO-SiO <b>2</b> -B <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 (Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3, Fe <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3) systems are calculated. The effects {{of the content of}} B <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3, Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 and Fe <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 on activities are analyzed. The results indicate that the activities of CaO and 2 CaO·SiO 2 are decreased with the increases of B <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3, Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 and Fe <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3. The effect of B <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 is most remarkable. Moreover, the activity of CaO·SiO 2 can be enhanced with increasing the contents of B <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3, Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 and Fe <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 respectively. These effects of Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 and Fe <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 are very similar, whereas the effect of B <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 is most significant. As a conclusion, B <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 is most effective to inhibit the formation of 2 CaO·SiO 2 as well as to promote the dissolution of lime...|$|R
40|$|Ag/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3, Cu/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 and the {{combined}} catalyst (Ag/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 -Cu/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3) were prepared, and their activity for the {{selective catalytic reduction}} of NOx by propene {{in the presence of}} excess oxygen was measured. Ag/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 showed excellent NOx to N- 2 activity but produced a large amount of CO during the reduction process. Cu/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 catalyst was not active in the reduction of lean NOx by propene but it was very effective for removing the CO produced in the process. Three different composed ways, Cu/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 placed after Ag/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 (Ag/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 Cu/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3), Ag/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 mechanically mixed with Cu/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 (Ag/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 + Cu/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3) and Ag-Cu/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 catalyst were investigated, respectively. The Ag/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 -Cu/Al <b>2</b> <b>O</b> 3 catalyst showed the highest activity for NOx reduction and could also remove CO completely at temperatures higher than 300 degreesC. The presence of water vapor in feed gases lowered the NOx conversion over {{the combined}} catalyst but did not show obvious effect on the CO conversion...|$|R
