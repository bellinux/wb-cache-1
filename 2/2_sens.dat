40|$|SummaryActive {{segregation}} of essential organelles {{is required for}} successful cell division. The essential budding yeast myosin V Myo 2 actively segregates most organelles along polarized actin cables [1, 2]. The mechanism of mitochondrial segregation remains controversial, with movement driven by actin polymerization [3 – 5], movement driven by association with transported cortical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [6, 7], and direct transport by Myo 2 [8 – 11] proposed as models. Two nonessential proteins, Mmr 1 and the Rab GTPase Ypt 11, bind Myo 2 and have been implicated in mitochondrial inheritance, although their specific roles are also contended [7 – 9,  11]. We generated myo <b>2</b> <b>sens</b> mutations that exhibit no overt phenotype but render MMR 1 essential and have compromised Ypt 11 binding. We then isolated myo <b>2</b> <b>sens</b> mmr 1 ts conditional mutants and determined {{that they have a}} specific and severe defect in active mitochondrial inheritance, revealing mitochondrial transport by Myo 2 as an essential function. ypt 11 Δ mmr 1 ts cells also have conditional defects in growth and active transport of mitochondria into the bud, both of which are suppressed by artificially forcing mitochondrial inheritance. At the restrictive temperature, cells defective in mitochondrial inheritance give rise to dead buds that go through cytokinesis normally, showing no evidence of a proposed cell-cycle mitochondrial inheritance checkpoint [12]. Thus, active mitochondrial inheritance is an essential process and a function of Myo 2 that requires either Mmr 1 or Ypt 11...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{evaluate}} (I) trastuzumab-containing primary systemic therapy (PST) {{in human}} {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor 2 (Her 2) overexpressing breast carcinomas.; (II) compare the patients who achieved {{and those who did}} not achieve pathological complete remission (pCR), and (III) analyze the accuracy of different clinical-imaging modalities in tumor response monitoring. Methods 188 patients who received PST between 2008 and 2014 were reviewed and 43 Her 2 overexpressing breast cancer patients (28 Luminal B/Her 2 -positive and 15 Her 2 -positive) were enrolled. 26 patients received mostly taxane-based PST without trastuzumab (Group 1) and 17 patients received trastuzumab- containing PST (Group 2). We compared the concordance between pCR and complete remission (CR) defined by breast-ultrasound, CR defined by standard 18 F-fluoro-deoxy- glucose positron emission tomography and computerized tomography (FDG-PET/CT) criteria (Method 1) and CR defined by a novel, breast cancer specific FDG-PET/CT criteria (Method 2). Sensitivity (sens), specificity (spec), and positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated. Results Ten patients (38. 5 %) in Group 1 and eight (47 %) in Group 2 achieved pCR. pCR was significantly more frequent in Her 2 -positive than in Luminal B/Her 2 -positive tumors in both Group 1 : (P = 0. 043) and Group 2 : (P = 0. 029). PET/CT evaluated by the breast cancer specific criteria (Method 2) differentiated pCR from non-pCR more accurately in both groups (Group 1 : sens = 77. 8 %, spec = 100 %, PPV = 100 %, NPV = 71. 4 %; Group 2 : sens = 87. 5 %, spec = 62. 5 %, PPV = 70 %, NPV = 83. 3 %) than standard PET/CT criteria (Method 1) (Group 1 : sens = 22. 2 % spec = 100 % PPV = 100 % NPV = 41. 7 %; in Group 2 : sens = 37. 5 %, spec = 87. 5 %, PPV = 75 % NPV = 58. 3 %) or breast ultrasound (Group 1, sens = 83. 3 % spec = 25 % PPV = 62. 5 % NPV = 50 %; Group <b>2,</b> <b>sens</b> = 100 % spec = 12. 5 % PPV = 41. 6 % NPV = 100 %). Conclusion The benefit of targeted treatment with trastuzumab- containing PST in Her 2 overexpressing breast cancer was defined in terms of pCR rate. Luminal B/Her 2 -positive subtype needs further subdivision to identify patients who would benefit from PST. Combined evaluation of tumor response by our novel, breast cancer specific FDG-PET/CT criteria accurately differentiated pCR from non-pCR patients...|$|E

In yeast, the tRNA splicing endonuclease that cleaves the exon-intron junctions of pre-tRNAs consists of Sen 54 p, <b>Sen</b> <b>2</b> p, <b>Sen</b> 34 p, and Sen 15 p and was thought to be an integral membrane protein of the inner nuclear envelope.

The endonuclease is peripherally associated with the cytosolic surface of the outer mitochondrial membrane.

40|$|Condensin-mediated {{chromosome}} condensation {{is essential}} for genome stability upon cell division. Genetic {{studies have indicated that}} the association of condensin with chromatin is intimately linked to gene transcription, but what transcription-associated feature(s) direct(s) the accumulation of condensin remains unclear. Here we show in fission yeast that condensin becomes strikingly enriched at RNA Pol III-transcribed genes when Swd <b>2.</b> <b>2</b> and <b>Sen</b> 1, two factors involved in the transcription process, are simultaneously deleted. Sen 1 is an ATP-dependent helicase whose orthologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae contributes both to terminate transcription of some RNA Pol II transcripts and to antagonize the formation of DNA:RNA hybrids in the genome. Using two independent mapping techniques, we show that DNA:RNA hybrids form in abundance at Pol III-transcribed genes in fission yeast but we demonstrate that they are unlikely to faciliate the recruitment of condensin. Instead, we show that Sen 1 forms a stable and abundant complex with RNA Pol III and that Swd <b>2.</b> <b>2</b> and <b>Sen</b> 1 antagonize both the interaction of RNA Pol III with chromatin and RNA Pol III-dependent transcription. When Swd <b>2.</b> <b>2</b> and <b>Sen</b> 1 are lacking, the increased concentration of RNA Pol III and condensin at Pol III-transcribed genes is accompanied by the accumulation of topoisomerase I and II and by local nucleosome depletion, suggesting that Pol III-transcribed genes suffer topological stress.
