5000|$|... <b>2-Methylpentane,</b> trivially {{known as}} isohexane, is a {{branched-chain}} alkane with the molecular formula C6H14. It is a structural isomer of hexane {{composed of a}} methyl group bonded to the second carbon atom in a pentane chain.|$|E
5000|$|... 2-Methyl-2-pentanol (IUPAC name: 2-methylpentan-2-ol) is {{an organic}} {{chemical}} compound. It {{can be added}} to a gas chromatograph to help distinguish between branched compounds, especially alcohols. Its presence in urine can be used to test for exposure to <b>2-methylpentane.</b>|$|E
50|$|The racemic diamine {{can also}} be used for the {{preparation}} of specific polyamides and after reaction with phosgene to form <b>2-methylpentane</b> diisocyanate as a reaction component in polyurethanes. Nitrilases regioselectively hydrolyze the ω-nitrile group in α, ω-dinitriles without detectable amide intermediate directly to the carboxyl group. 4-cyanopentanoic acid is formed in high yield.|$|E
5000|$|... 3-Methylpentane is a {{branched-chain}} alkane {{with the}} molecular formula C6H14. It is a structural isomer of hexane {{composed of a}} methyl group bonded to the third carbon atom in a pentane chain. It is of similar structure to the isomeric <b>2-methylpentane,</b> which has the methyl group located on the second carbon of the pentane chain.|$|E
5000|$|Almost all {{corn oil}} is expeller-pressed, then solvent-extracted using hexane or <b>2-methylpentane</b> (isohexane). [...] The solvent is {{evaporated}} from the corn oil, recovered, and re-used. After extraction, the corn oil is then refined by degumming and/or alkali treatment, {{both of which}} remove phosphatides. Alkali treatment also neutralizes free fatty acids and removes color (bleaching). Final steps in refining include winterization (the removal of waxes), and deodorization by steam distillation of the oil at [...] under a high vacuum.|$|E
5000|$|Isomerases {{catalyze}} {{changes within}} one molecule. [...] They convert one isomer to another, {{meaning that the}} end product has the same molecular formula but a different physical structure. Isomers themselves exist in many varieties but can generally be classified as structural isomers or stereoisomers. Structural isomers have a different ordering of bonds and/or different bond connectivity from one another, {{as in the case}} of hexane and its four other isomeric forms (<b>2-methylpentane,</b> 3-methylpentane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, and 2,3-dimethylbutane).|$|E
