50|$|Humans {{perceive}} {{the pitch of}} a transverse flute at the amplified <b>2nd</b> <b>harmonic</b> or more commonly, one octave above the produced fundamental.|$|E
5000|$|When the {{conversion}} to <b>2nd</b> <b>harmonic</b> becomes significant it becomes necessary to include {{depletion of the}} fundamental. One then has the coupled equations: ...|$|E
50|$|All valve sets produce <b>2nd</b> <b>harmonic</b> distortion, {{which is}} fairly euphonic. Some also produce {{significant}} 3rd harmonic distortion, {{which is less}} pleasant to the ear.|$|E
50|$|In the UK around 1982, the Sansui AU-D101 {{amplifier}} and {{its more}} powerful sibling the AU-D33, were highly acclaimed by audiophiles and were so well matched {{to a pair}} of KEF Coda III speakers that they could be bought as a set from some outlets. These amplifiers used a complex feed-forward servo system which resulted in very low <b>2nd</b> order <b>harmonic</b> distortion. Despite this success, Sansui completely failed to follow up with further mass market audiophile components.|$|R
50|$|Simple {{amplifiers}} {{like the}} common emitter configuration have primarily low-order distortion, {{such as the}} <b>2nd</b> and 3rd <b>harmonics.</b> In audio systems, these can be minimally audible because musical signals are typically already a harmonic series, and the low-order distortion products are hidden by the masking effect of the human hearing system.|$|R
50|$|Thus, {{when the}} grid disconnects, the THD {{of the local}} circuit will {{naturally}} increase {{to that of the}} inverters themselves. This provides a very secure method of detecting islanding, because there are generally no other sources of THD that would match that of the inverter. Additionally, interactions within the inverters themselves, notably the transformers, have non-linear effects that produce unique <b>2nd</b> and 3rd <b>harmonics</b> that are easily measurable.|$|R
5000|$|Motörhead bassist Lemmy's bass sound {{has been}} called [...] "fuzz-tone bass" [...] by a music critic. In the 1980 song [...] "Ace of Spades", his fuzz bass tone can be clearly heard. [...] "Lemmy uses no effects pedals: the {{distortion}} is produced naturally by the valve tube amplifiers, and the high volumewhich gives a classic valve, <b>2nd</b> <b>harmonic</b> distortion." ...|$|E
50|$|The normal playing {{range of}} most three-valved brass {{instruments}} extends from three whole tones below the <b>2nd</b> <b>harmonic</b> of the condensed instrument to the 10th harmonic. Skilled players can produce tones outside this range. For many transposing brass instruments, this range is written as extending from F♯ below middle C to E two octaves {{and a third}} above middle C.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relationship}} between two pitches, called an interval, is {{the ratio of}} their absolute frequencies. The easiest intervals to identify and tune are those where the note frequencies have a simple whole-number ratio (e.g. octave with a 2:1 ratio, perfect fifth with 3:2, etc.) because the harmonics of these intervals coincide and beat when {{they are out of}} tune. (For a perfect fifth, the 3rd harmonic of the lower note coincides with the <b>2nd</b> <b>harmonic</b> of the top note.) ...|$|E
50|$|Rhodamine 6G is {{also used}} as a laser dye, or gain medium, in dye lasers, and is pumped by the <b>2nd</b> (532 nm) <b>harmonic</b> from an Nd:YAG laser or {{nitrogen}} laser. The dye has a remarkably high photostability, high fluorescence quantum yield (0.95), low cost, and its lasing range has close proximity to its absorption maximum (approximately 530 nm). The lasing range of the dye is 555 to 585 nm with a maximum at 566 nm.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Hammond organ imitated {{the function}} of a pipe organ's ranks of pipes in multiple registers by using additive synthesis of waveforms from harmonic series to generate its sounds. The Hammond organ's individual waveforms were made by mechanical tonewheels which rotated beneath electromagnetic pickups. The component waveforms can be mixed in varying ratios by using drawbars mounted above the two keyboards. Hammond organs also have a harmonic percussion effect, in which the <b>2nd</b> and 3rd <b>harmonic</b> tones {{can be added to}} the attack envelope of a note.|$|R
50|$|The 2001 {{discovery}} of the 2nd an 3rd acoustic peaks in the CMB was an important piece of evidence for the inflation theory of {{the expansion of the}} universe. According to the theory, acoustic peaks are caused by the oscillations of matter during the big bang, which should be measurable as one main frequency or tone, with a series of overtones or harmonics. The 1st acoustic peak represents the main tone, and the 2nd and 3rd peaks discovered by DASI represent the <b>2nd</b> and 3rd <b>harmonics.</b> These readings {{can also be used to}} measure the baryon density of the early universe, and these measurements provided evidence for the existence of dark matter and dark energy. This has since become the ΛCDM Standard Model of Cosmology.|$|R
5000|$|Certain low brass {{instruments}} such as trombone, tuba, euphonium, and alto horn are whole-tube and {{can play the}} fundamental tone of each harmonic series with relative ease. Furthermore, the low brass often use extra valves to extend their range uniformly, since the fundamental is chromatically discontinuous with the lowest <b>2nd</b> <b>harmonic</b> reachable on a three-valve instrument or via the seven-position slide on a trombone. Trombone and tuba in particular are {{often called upon to}} play pedal notes (fundamental notes) and so-called [...] "false harmonics" [...] and [...] "false tones" [...] below their normal range.|$|E
5000|$|Measurements can be deceiving; {{high or low}} {{figures of}} certain {{technical}} characteristics do not necessarily offer a good representation of how the equipment sounds to each person. For example, some valve (vacuum tube) amplifiers produce greater amounts of total harmonic distortion, but this type of distortion (<b>2nd</b> <b>harmonic)</b> is not as disturbing to the ear as the higher order distortions produced by poorly designed transistor equipment. [...] The terms [...] "high-end audio" [...] and [...] "audiophile" [...] are typically used disparagingly by Audio Engineering Society members, who feel that the term [...] "high end audio" [...] is vague, concerning the widely varying performance of the products sold in this premium price segment, and that an [...] "audiophile" [...] is too often {{a person who is}} overly suggestible to the marketing claims from manufacturers and sellers.|$|E
50|$|Different {{materials}} for the stylus have been used over time. Thomas Edison introduced the use of sapphire in 1892 {{and the use of}} diamond in 1910 for his cylinder phonographs. The Edison Diamond Disc players (1912-1929), when properly played, hardly ever required the stylus to be changed. The styli for vinyl records were also made out of sapphire or diamond. A specific case is the specific stylus type of Bang & Olufsen's (B&O) moving magnet cartridge MMC 20CL, mostly used in parallel arm B&O turntables in the 4002/6000 series. It uses a sapphire stem on which a diamond tip is fixed by a special adhesive. A stylus tip mass as low as 0.3 milligram is the result and full tracking only requires 1 gram of stylus force, reducing record wear even further. Maximum distortion (<b>2nd</b> <b>harmonic)</b> fell below 0.6%.|$|E
5000|$|In {{conventional}} (non-period) orchestras, {{the highest}} baroque trumpet parts are usually {{played on the}} modern piccolo trumpet, an instrument that provides firm support of range, attack and intonation, while producing a brighter sound—very different from the natural trumpet the composers had in mind. The natural trumpet is differentiated from another valveless brass instrument, the bugle, {{in that it is}} nearly twice the length. This places the higher harmonics (from the 8th harmonic up, which are closer together in pitch) in a playable range, enabling the performance of diatonic melodies. The bugle, by contrast, is only useful for performing simple fanfares and military calls (such as [...] "Taps") in a lower range (normally only utilizing the <b>2nd</b> through 6th <b>harmonics),</b> based on the notes of a major triad. (For example, the notes B, D, and F on a bugle pitched in B.) ...|$|R
50|$|The term is {{employed}} in various disciplines, including music, physics, acoustics, electronic power transmission, radio technology, and other fields. It is typically applied to repeating signals, such as sinusoidal waves. A harmonic {{of such a}} wave is a wave with a frequency that is a positive integer multiple of {{the frequency of the}} original wave, known as the fundamental frequency. The original wave is also called the 1st harmonic, the following harmonics are known as higher harmonics. As all harmonics are periodic at the fundamental frequency, the sum of harmonics is also periodic at that frequency. For example, if the fundamental frequency is 50 Hz, a common AC power supply frequency, the frequencies of the first three higher harmonics are 100 Hz (<b>2nd</b> <b>harmonic),</b> 150 Hz (3rd harmonic), 200 Hz (4th harmonic) and any addition of waves with these frequencies is periodic at 50 Hz.|$|E
5000|$|For instance, if we {{press the}} Middle C key on the piano, the {{individual}} frequencies of the composite's harmonics {{will start at}} 261.6 Hz as the fundamental frequency, 523 Hz would be the <b>2nd</b> <b>Harmonic,</b> 785 Hz would be the 3rd Harmonic, 1046 Hz would be the 4th Harmonic, etc. The later harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, 261.6 Hz ( [...] ex: 2 x 261.6 = 523, 3 x 261.6 = 785, 4 x 261.6 = 1046 [...] ). While only about eight harmonics are really needed to audibly recreate the note, {{the total number of}} harmonics in this mathematical series can be large, although the higher the harmonic's numeral the weaker the magnitude and contribution of that harmonic. Contrary to intuition, a musical recording at its lowest physical level is not a collection of individual notes, but is really a collection of individual harmonics. That is why very similar-sounding recordings can be created with differing collections of instruments and their assigned notes. As long as the total harmonics of the recording are recreated to some degree, it does not really matter which instruments or which notes were used.|$|E
5000|$|Seismic energy transmits most {{efficiently}} between 10-40 Hz, i.e. in {{the same}} range as the fundamental frequency and <b>2nd</b> <b>harmonic</b> of an elephant rumble. [...] For Asian elephants, these calls have a frequency of 14-24 Hz, with sound pressure levels of 85-90 dB and last 10-15 seconds. For African elephants, calls range from 15-35 Hz and can be as loud as 117 dB, allowing communication over many kilometers.It seems that when an elephant rumbles, the infrasound that is produced couples with {{the surface of the}} earth and then propagates through the ground. In this way, elephants are able to use seismic vibrations at infrasound frequencies for communication. [...] These vibrations can be detected by the skin of an elephant's feet and trunk, which relay the resonant vibrations, similar to the skin on a drum. To listen attentively, individuals will lift one foreleg from the ground, possibly triangulating the source, and face the source of the sound. Occasionally, attentive elephants can be seen to lean forward, putting more weight on their front feet. These behaviours presumably increase the ground contact and sensitivity of the legs. Sometimes, the trunk will be laid on the ground.|$|E
