25|$|In early 2009, {{a plan to}} {{modernize}} Love Field was announced. The $519 million master plan will replace the existing terminals with a new <b>20-gate</b> concourse and expanded baggage facilities. The project also called for a $250 million people mover system to connect to Dallas Area Rapid Transit's Burbank Station, but this was eliminated {{in favor of a}} cheaper bus connection to the Inwood Station.|$|E
25|$|After {{extensive}} {{negotiations with}} the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the compromise bill passed both Houses of Congress on Friday, September 29, 2006, just before the 109th Congress adjourned for the November elections. Hutchison led the effort to pass the bill in the Senate while Rep. Kay Granger led a bipartisan Texas House coalition to see the bill through to a successful conclusion in the House. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law on October 13, 2006, including the <b>20-gate</b> cap. Southwest and American airlines then required approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to begin one-stop flights from Love Field to destinations outside the Wright limits.|$|E

50|$|The CPU had a 60 ns {{clock cycle}} (16.67 MHz clock frequency) and its logic was built from <b>20-gate</b> emitter-coupled logic {{integrated}} circuits originally developed by TI for the ILLIAC IV supercomputer. The CPU had an extremely advanced architecture and organization for its era, supporting microcoded arithmetic and mathematical instructions that operated on scalars, vectors, or matrices. The vector processing facilities had a memory-to-memory architecture; where the vector operands were read from, {{and the resulting}} vector written to, memory. The CPU could be have one, two, or four vector lanes, allowing the CPU to produce one to four vector results every cycle, depending {{on the number of}} vector lanes installed. The vector lanes were also used for scalar instructions, and each lane could keep up to 12 scalar instructions in-flight simultaneously. The CPU, with four lanes, allowed up to 36 instructions in total across the entire CPU.|$|E
