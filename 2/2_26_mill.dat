40|$|PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> antigen was {{originally}} {{identified as a}} small mucin-type glycoprotein induced during chemical carcinogenesis on mouse skin. Cloning and sequencing of the murine and human PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> cDNAs revealed that the sequence was identical to other reported proteins termed T 1 a (a marker for alveolar type I epithelial cells) and podoplanin (a glycoprotein expressed in glomerular podocytes). In this review, we summarise the current knowledge on the biology of PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> (T 1 a/podoplanin). Although the physiological function of this protein is not well established as yet, several characteristics make this molecule unique among mucin-like glycoproteins. For example, PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> (T 1 a/podoplanin) appears {{to play an important}} role in morphogenesis during development, and it is a marker for the lymphatic endothelium. In cancer, PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> is induced in tumours derived from squamous epithelia, and is associated with cell migration and malignant progression. These findings are discussed in the context of cancer- associated membrane mucins in which PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> antigen, together with a newly-discovered small mucin called dysadherin, form a special group. The work on PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> antigen carried out by our laboratory has been supported by grants from the >Fondo de Investigación Sanitaria> (FIS), >Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnología> (MCyT) and >Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid> (CAM) of Spain.

40|$|PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> antigen {{is a small}} mucin-type transmembrane {{glycoprotein}} induced in mouse epidermal keratinocytes during carcinogenesis. It {{is located}} at plasma membrane projections, such as microvilli and ruffles, where it interacts with the actin cytoskeleton. Previous studies revealed that ectopic expression of PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> in epidermal MCA 3 D keratinocytes induces cell surface extensions and increased motility. Here, we show that PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> -expressing MCA 3 D (3 D <b>2.</b> <b>26)</b> cell transfectants undergo a phenotypic conversion linked to the acquisition of malignant characteristics. The 3 D <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> cells down-regulate basal keratin K 14 and up-regulate vimentin and keratin K 8 expression. Immunofluorescence analysis in 3 D <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> cell cultures showed loss of cortical actin filaments and destabilization of adherens junctions mediated by E- and P-cadherin, although both cadherin mRNAs were expressed in the transfectants. When the cadherin protein levels were analyzed in Western blots, no P-cadherin protein or smaller polypeptide E-cadherin forms were detected, suggesting that E- and P-cadherin synthesized in 3 D <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> cells was unstable and proteolytically degraded. Transplantation of 3 D <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> cells into athymic nude mice induced tumors, whereas MCA 3 D cells and control (3 DN) transfectants were not tumorigenic after 72 days postinjection. The phenotype of the tumors was undifferentiated, with mixed regions exhibiting a glandular differentiation pattern in which the presence of numerous surface microvilli was observed at the ultrastructural level. Interestingly, PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> antigen was highly expressed in these microvillous cell surfaces. Tumor cells were vimentin- and K 8 -positive and showed an aberrant pattern of E-cadherin protein expression in which large cytoplasmic aggregates were found close to the nucleus. Infiltration of tumor cells into lymphatic vessels {{and the presence of}} frequent regional lymph node metastases were also observed in the tumors. These results indicate that expression of PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> antigen in premalignant keratinocytes induces a fully transformed and metastatic phenotype, and they suggest an involvement of PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> in malignant progression.

We {{report the}} full cDNA {{sequence}} encoding the human homologue of murine PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> (T 1 α- 2, podoplanin), a small mucin-type trans-membrane glycoprotein originally {{identified as a}} cell-surface antigen induced in keratinocytes during mouse skin carcinogenesis. The human PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> gene is expressed as 2 transcripts of 0. 9 and 2. 7 kb in several normal tissues, such as the placenta, skeletal muscle, heart and lung. Using a specific polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide of the protein ectodomain, PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> was immunohistochemically detected in about 25 % (15 / 61) of human early oral squamous cell carcinomas. PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> distribution in the tumours was heterogeneous and often restricted to the invasive front. Double immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analysis showed that PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> colocalized with the membrane cytoskeleton linker ezrin at the surface of tumour cells and that its presence in vivo was associated with downregulation of membrane E-cadherin protein expression. Ectopic expression of human PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> in HeLa carcinoma cells and immortalized HaCaT keratinocytes promoted a redistribution of ezrin to the cell edges, the formation of cell-surface protrusions and reduced Ca 2 +-dependent cell-cell adhesiveness. These results point to PA <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> as a novel biomarker for oral squamous cell carcinomas that might be involved in migration/invasion. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In this retrospective observational study, 582 patients admitted with acute pancreatitis, who had serum triglyceride levels measured within the first 24 hours, were divided into two groups. The study group consisted of patients with a triglyceride level ≥ <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> [*]mmol/L (group <b>2)</b> and the control group consisted of triglyceride level of < <b>2.</b> <b>26</b> [*]mmol/L (group 1).
