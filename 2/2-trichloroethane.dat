40|$|Gap {{junctional}} {{intercellular communication}} (GJIC) and cell proliferation were studied {{in control and}} 1, 1 '-bis(p-chlorophenyl) - 2, 2, <b>2,-trichloroethane</b> (DDT) treated precision-cut liver slices of rat by evaluating connexin 32 (Cx 32) expression and 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. In addition, the effect of different culture media (RPMI and WME) on control and DDT influenced Cx 32 expression and cell proliferation was determined. Cx 32 expression in control precision-cut liver slices was maintained during 8 h of culturing, but decreased after prolonged culturing. Control cell proliferation was significantly higher when WME was used as culture medium than when RPMI was used. In slices treated with DDT Cx 32 expression was decreased. In slices cultured in RPMI medium, this decrease preceded a dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation. These results show the usefulness of precision-cut liver slices in studying cellular proliferation and intercellular communication.
