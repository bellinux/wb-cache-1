25|$|Another {{reason for}} Dutch-speaking white farmers {{trekking}} {{away from the}} Cape was {{the abolition of slavery}} by the British government on Emancipation Day, 1 December 1838. The farmers complained they could not replace the labour of their slaves without losing an excessive amount of money. The farmers had invested large amounts of capital in slaves. Owners who had purchased slaves on credit or put them up as surety against loans faced financial ruin. Britain had allocated the sum of 1 <b>200</b> <b>000</b> British Pounds as compensation to the Dutch settlers, on condition the Dutch farmers had to lodge their claims in Britain as well as the fact that the value of the slaves was many times the allocated amount. This caused further dissatisfaction among the Dutch settlers. The settlers, incorrectly, believed that the Cape Colony administration had taken the money due to them as payment for freeing their slaves. Those settlers who were allocated money could only claim it in Britain in person or through an agent. The commission charged by agents was the same as the payment for one slave, thus those settlers only claiming for one slave would receive nothing.|$|E
25|$|Large {{number of}} Indian troops had begun {{arriving}} in Malayan peninsula and Singapore by 1941, {{as a part}} of defensive preparations for possible war with Japan. It was estimated that were some 37 000 Indian troops stationed in these areas, making up roughly about the 40 percent of the total military strength of the British forces. The British-Indian troops swelled from <b>200</b> <b>000</b> to 900 000 between 1939 and 1941. However, these deployments were beset with a number of problems. The troops were too thinly, with insufficient resources and supplies in the Malay Peninsula and Singapore. Further, {{a large proportion of the}} British-Indian troops were very young recruits (as a result of the open recruitment policy of the British) who had very little or no combat training and experience, leading to anxiety amongst the British-Indian forces. Feelings of discrimination amongst British Indian soldiers, compared to the pay and service conditions for European soldiers crreated acrimony. Indiscriminate recruitment by the Indina government in order to maintain the numbers for its army, meant that it was no longer carefully curating its selection for the armed forces. By 1941, British abuse, both verbal and physical of the Indian soldiers was rampant.|$|E

40|$|Melatonin {{has been}} {{identified}} {{in a variety of}} crustacean species, but its function is not as well understood as in vertebrates. The present study investigates whether melatonin has an effect on crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) gene expression, oxygen consumption (VO 2) and circulating glucose and lactate levels, in response to different dissolved-oxygen concentrations, in the crab Neohelice granulata, as well as whether these possible effects are eyestalk- or receptor-dependent. Melatonin decreased CHH expression in crabs exposed for 45 min to 6 (2, <b>200</b> or 20, <b>000</b> pmol·crab− 1) or 2 mgO 2 ·L− 1 (200 pmol·crab− 1). Since luzindole (200 nmol·crab− 1) did not significantly (p > 0. 05) alter the melatonin effect, its action {{does not seem to be}} mediated by vertebrate-typical MT 1 and MT 2 receptors. Melatonin (200 pmol·crab− 1) increased the levels of glucose and lactate in crabs exposed to 6 mgO 2 ·L− 1, and luzindole (200 nmol·crab− 1) decreased this effect, indicating that melatonin receptors are involved in hyperglycemia and lactemia. Melatonin showed no effect on VO 2. Interestingly, in vitro incubation of eyestalk ganglia for 45 min at 0. 7 mgO 2 ·L− 1 significantly (p < 0. 05) increased melatonin production in this organ. In addition, injections of melatonin significantly increased the levels of circulating melatonin in crabs exposed for 45 min to 6 (<b>200</b> or 20, <b>000</b> pmol·crab− 1), 2 (<b>200</b> and 20, <b>000</b> pmol·crab− 1) and 0. 7 (<b>200</b> or 20, <b>000</b> pmol·crab− 1) mgO 2 ·L− 1. Therefore, melatonin seems to have an effect on the metabolism of N. granulata. This molecule inhibited the gene expression of CHH and caused an eyestalk- and receptor-dependent hyperglycemia, which suggests that melatonin may have a signaling role in metabolic regulation in this crab...|$|R
