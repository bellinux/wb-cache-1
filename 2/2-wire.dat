50|$|The {{primary use}} of a {{voiceband}} hybrid coil is to convert between <b>2-wire</b> and 4-wire operation in sequential sections of a communications circuit, for example in a four-wire terminating set. Such conversion was necessary when repeaters were introduced in a <b>2-wire</b> circuit, a frequent practice at early 20th century telephony. Without hybrids, the output of one amplifier feeds directly into the input of the other, resulting in a howling situation (upper diagram). By using hybrids, the outputs and inputs are isolated, resulting in correct <b>2-wire</b> repeater operation. Late in the century, this practice became rare but hybrids continued in use in line cards.|$|E
5000|$|For example, a {{4-wire circuit}} may, {{by means of}} a 4-wire {{terminating}} set, be connected to a <b>2-wire</b> telephone set. Also, a pair of 4-wire terminating sets may be used to introduce an intermediate 4-wire circuit into a <b>2-wire</b> circuit, in which loop repeaters may be situated to amplify signals in each direction without positive feedback and oscillation.|$|E

50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} signals produced by Wheelock were the A-1 series of AC-powered, dual-projector electromechanical horns. In the early 1970s, Wheelock introduced the 31 (AC-powered) and 34 (DC-powered) series of electromechanical horns. Around 1976, Wheelock created the 7001 (<b>2-wire,</b> flush-mount DC), 7002 (<b>2-wire,</b> surface-mount DC), 34+WS (4-wire, surface-mount DC), and 7004 (<b>2-wire,</b> surface-mount AC) electromechanical horn/strobes. These were the first fire alarm signals to use xenon strobes instead of incandescent lights. The horn and strobe on the 7001 and 7002 models are wired in series, causing the horn to stutter when the strobe flashes. Around 1983, Wheelock redesigned the horn's grilles, making them vandal resistant. This product line became extremely popular among third-party security companies, such as Honeywell, Ademco, and Cerberus Pyrotronics (now part of Siemens AG). In 1994, Wheelock discontinued this series, because their low-intensity strobes {{did not meet the}} new light distribution requirements of the ADA. The 31T is still in production today for general signaling purposes.|$|E

5000|$|Half-duplex packet {{switched}} networks based on carrier sense multiple access, for example <b>2-wire</b> or hubbed Ethernet, Wireless local area networks and Bluetooth, {{can be considered}} as time-division duplexing systems, albeit not TDMA with fixed frame-lengths.|$|E
50|$|For use in <b>2-wire</b> repeaters, {{the single}} {{transformer}} version suffices, since amplifiers in the repeaters have grounded inputs and outputs. X, Y, and Z {{share a common}} ground. As shown at left, signal into W, the <b>2-wire</b> port, will appear at X and Z. But since Y is bridged from center of coil to center of X and Z, no signal appears. Signal into X will appear at W and Y. But signal at Z is the difference of what appears at Y and, through the transformer coil, at W, which is zero. Similar reasoning proves both pairs, W & Y, X & Z, are conjugates.|$|E
50|$|Electric {{underfloor}} heating systems cause low frequency magnetic fields (in the 50-60 Hz range), old 1-wire systems {{much more so}} than modern <b>2-wire</b> systems.

50|$|Powerpole {{connectors}} {{are physically}} and electrically hermaphroditic, thus avoiding {{the need to}} worry about which end is the plug and which the socket, or which end has the correct polarity, {{as is the case with}} the physically but not electrically hermaphroditic <b>2-wire</b> trailer plug.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-wire E&M uses a 4-wire (2-pair) {{transmission}} path for the voice signal.2-wire E&M uses a single pair for both transmit and receive voice signal. This is much inferior to 4-wire E&M as the <b>2-wire</b> interface uses hybrid transformers which reduce signal quality and can introduce echo.|$|E
50|$|Invariably, pickups {{will require}} custom work or {{modification}} prior to installation in a Jesselli guitar. A pickup may be completely rewound with tapered wire or {{changed from a}} <b>2-wire</b> to 3 or 4 wire configuration to alter the pickup sonically and to allow for additional tones when changing tone or volume controls or pickup switch positions. Each pickup is also hand-fitted with a custom made leather cover.|$|E
50|$|In {{building}} automation, eBUS (energy bus) is a <b>2-wire</b> digital serial data-bus {{communication interface}} used in heating and solar energy appliances, by mainly German manufacturers. It was originally {{proposed by the}} Karl Dungs company, and has since been adopted by several other manufacturers. The eBUS interface has also been used by home-automation enthusiasts to connect their domestic solar or heating system to a networked PC for monitoring or remote control.|$|E
50|$|The {{digital line}} card is {{equipped}} with 16 identical digital line interfaces. Each interface provides a multiplexed voice, data, and signaling path to and from a digital terminal (telephone) over a <b>2-wire</b> full duplex 512 kHz Time Division Multiplex (TDM) digital link. Each digital telephone and associated data terminal is assigned a separate Terminal Number (TN) in the system database, giving a total of 32 addressable units per card.|$|E
5000|$|Telephone hybrids {{are used}} in {{telephone}} exchanges to convert the 4-wire appearance to the <b>2-wire</b> last mile connection to the subscriber's telephone. A different kind of hybrid is used in telephone handsets to convert the four wires of the transmitter (earpiece) and receiver (microphhone) to the <b>2-wire</b> line connection. This kind of hybrid is more commonly called an induction coil due to its derivation from high-voltage induction coils. It does not produce a high voltage, but like the high-voltage variety, it is a step-up transformer in order to impedance match the low-impedance carbon button transmitter to the higher impedance parts of the system. The simple induction coil later evolved into a form of hybrid as a sidetone reduction measure, or volume of microphone output that was fed back to the earpiece. Without this, the phone user's own voice would be louder in the earpiece than the other party's. [...] Today, the transformer version of the hybrid {{has been replaced by}} resistor networks and compact IC versions, which use integrated circuit electronics to do the job of the hybrid coil.|$|E
50|$|The U {{interface}} or U {{reference point}} is a Basic Rate Interface (BRI) in the local loop of an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). It {{is characterized by the}} use of a <b>2-wire</b> transmission system that connects the network termination type 1 (NT1) on the customer's premises and the line termination (LT) in the carrier's local exchange. It is not as distance sensitive as a service using an S interface or T interface.|$|E
50|$|When {{both the}} <b>2-wire</b> and the 4-wire {{circuits}} must be balanced, double transformer hybrids are used, as shown at right. Signal into port W splits between X and Z, {{but due to}} reversed connection to the windings, cancel at port Y. Signal into port X goes to W and Y. But due to reversed connection to ports W and Y, Z gets no signal. Thus the pairs, W & Y, X & Z, are conjugates.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{defines a}} <b>2-wire</b> 18 gauge wire cable that can {{run up to}} 130 ft and operates at 9600 bit/s. A message is composed of up to 21 characters, unless the engine is stopped and the vehicle is not moving in which case transmitters are allowed to exceed the 21 byte max message length. Messages start with a Message ID (MID) character and finish with a checksum at the end. Characters are transmitted in the common 8N1 format.|$|E
50|$|SWER also {{reduces the}} largest {{cost of a}} {{distribution}} network, the number of poles. Conventional <b>2-wire</b> or 3-wire distribution lines have a higher power transfer capacity, but can require 7 poles per kilometre, with spans of 100 to 150 metres. SWER's high line voltage and low current also permits the use of low-cost galvanized steel wire (historically, No. 8 fence wire). Steel's greater strength permits spans of 400 metres or more, {{reducing the number of}} poles to 2.5 per kilometre.|$|E
50|$|Star quad is a four-conductor cable {{in which}} all four {{conductors}} are twisted together around the cable axis. It is sometimes used for two circuits, such as 4-wire telephony and other telecommunications applications. In this configuration each pair uses two non-adjacent conductors. Other times it is used for a single, balanced line, such as audio applications and <b>2-wire</b> telephony. In this configuration two non-adjacent conductors are terminated together {{at both ends of}} the cable, and the other two conductors are also terminated together.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s most echo {{cancellation}} was done inside modems of type v.32 and later. In voiceband modems this allowed {{using the same}} frequencies in both directions simultaneously, greatly increasing the data rate. As part of connection negotiation, each modem sent line probe signals, measured the echoes, and set up its delay lines. Echoes in this case did not include long echoes caused by acoustic coupling, but did include short echoes caused by impedance mismatches in the <b>2-wire</b> local loop to the telephone exchange.|$|E
50|$|Strictly speaking, a {{textbook}} installation will only actually use pins 2, 5 (for the voice) and 3 (for the ringer). Having said this, most modern telephones contain their own ringing capacitor, to cater for the Irish telephone system {{which does not}} have a capacitor built into the socket, and <b>2-wire</b> extensions, which means that extension wiring can usually be run with only pins 2 and 5. Often where multi-core cable is used, the remaining cables are used for wiring extensions on additional incoming telephone lines.|$|E
5000|$|The eBUS <b>2-wire</b> {{interface}} is an asynchronous {{serial port}} with active-low voltage that exchanges 8-bit bytes with start and (single) stop bits (no parity bit), at a symbol rate of 2400 baud, {{and can be}} implemented with a standard UART plus a voltage converter. It differs from the RS-232 interface, from which it is derived, in that the voltage levels were chosen to allow the bus also to supply power to bus participants, who can use a voltage stabilizer to derive an internal 5 V supply: ...|$|E
50|$|In {{process control}} systems, {{the market is}} {{dominated}} by FOUNDATION fieldbus and PROFIBUS PA. Both technologies use the same physical layer (<b>2-wire</b> manchester-encoded current modulation at 31.25 kHz) but are not interchangeable. As a general guide, applications which are controlled and monitored by PLCs (programmable logic controllers) tend towards PROFIBUS, and applications which are controlled and monitored by a DCS (digital/distributed control system) tend towards FOUNDATION Fieldbus. PROFIBUS technology is made available through Profibus International with headquarters in Karlsruhe, Germany. FOUNDATION Fieldbus technology is owned and distributed by the Fieldbus Foundation of Austin, Texas.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the later}} 1AESS, the reeds {{themselves}} were of remanent magnetic material. This [...] "Remreed" [...] design allowed further reduction {{in size and}} power consumption. A [...] "grid" [...] of 1024 <b>2-wire</b> crosspoints, arranged as two stages of eight 8x8 switches, was permanently packaged in a box. Despite the sealed contacts, plating with silver rather than with precious metals resulted in reed arrays being less reliable than crossbar switches. When one crosspoint failed, the grid box was quickly replaced whole, and either repaired at a local workbench or shipped to a repair shop.|$|E
