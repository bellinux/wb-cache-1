Rural China is not a hotbed of dissatisfaction with life, possibly because most people are found to confine their reference groups to the village. Relative income within the village and relative income over time, both in the past and expected in the future, are shown to influence happiness. `Subjective well-being poverty` functions are estimated, in which income and various proxies for `capabilities` and `functionings` appear as arguments. Even amidst the poverty of rural China, social functionings, attitudes and expectations are important to subjective well-being.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{comparatively}} analyse how well-being is distributed across {{the social structure}} in European welfare regimes. Welfare regime refers {{to a group of}} countries having a relatively similar orientation and culture regarding social policy. Well-being is interpreted and operationalised as a multidimensional concept. More concretely, well-being is approached in terms of the traditional core areas of welfare and social policy (indicators: economic hardship, sickness) but a special emphasis is piaced upon social aspects of life (indicators: social relations, social contribution, local ties, recognition and societal pessimism). The perspective of vulnerable social positions (unemployment, poverty, immigration background etc.) is chosen in all the analyses. The data set of the European Social Survey (round 3, 2006 / 2007) is used in the study since it includes an extensive <b>module</b> <b>on</b> <b>well-being,</b> which enables convenient and fruitful analytical paths. Multilevel analysis is chosen as the key method for the study due to its ability to handle data that involve grouped observations (e. g. individuals in countries) and research questions that are of multilevel nature themselves. The overall methodological idea is to start from general and broad descriptions and move towards a narrower and more specific focus. Four indicators are chosen for the in-depth analysis: economic hardship, sickness, societal pessimism and recognition. The results mostly corroborate the view that well-being is to a significant extent conditioned by the position one occupies in the social structure and also by the welfare regime one lives in. How life chances are distributed across the social structure varies between the country groups due to their different approaches to welfare policy. The Eastern European country group is generally characterised by relatively frequent ill-being — lack of <b>well-being</b> — <b>on</b> almost all dimensions included in the analysis. Economic hardship is conspicuousiy prevalent in these nations, especially among the unemployed. In fact, unemployment is a major risk factor for economic hardship in all regimes. The Nordic regime is distinguished by low rates of ill-being in virtually all dimensions, but the relatively high sickness rate is an exception: poverty in particular exposes to sickness in the Nordic world of welfare. The link between vulnerability and societal pessimism is rather typical for both the Eastern European and Continental European regimes. Poverty makes future views bleaker in almost ali country groups, whereas immigrants are generally less pessimistic. However, in the Nordic regime immigration background seems to be an adverse factor with respect to well-being. Poverty, unemployment and oneliness are associated to low recognition, whereas old age seems to be related to more respectful treatment. Living in the liberal welfare regime and being poor or unemployed is the combination that most severely exposes its occupant to the demoralising expetiences of low recognition. In other words, the moral flavour of everyday life in a vulnerable social position differs by country groups. Welfare regimes are more than just systems of benefit allocation and service production - also culture matters...|$|R

We present several theoretical arguments for these competing hypotheses and we test these hypotheses using interaction effects. In a second step, we examine variability in the effect of the three examined life course transitions <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> (MHI- 5) using interactions with sex, age, and educational level.

This study aimed to examine the actor and partner effects of resilience <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> in Chinese older couples and the potential mediating role of spousal exchanges at the actor and partner levels. Using a 2 -wave longitudinal design, a total of 158 Chinese couples (age range 60 - 97 years) completed measures of resilience, perceived spousal exchanges (spousal support and negative exchanges), and well-being. The results showed that (a) the dyad had significant congruence in resilience and well-being, respectively; (b) resilience had significant actor and partner effects <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> within the dyad; and (c) negative spousal exchanges could not mediate the actor and partner effects of resilience <b>on</b> <b>well-being,</b> and a gender difference emerged for the mediation role of spousal support: Actor and partner effects of husbands&# 39; resilience <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> were mediated by both partners&# 39; perceived spousal support, whereas the actor and partner effects of wives&# 39; resilience <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> were not mediated by perceived spousal support.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effect of retirement <b>on</b> psychological <b>well-being.</b> Findings from previous research in this field are inconsistent, as both positive, negative, and sometimes no effect of retirement <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> is reported. In the paper we suggest that the divergent results may arise from the mixing of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, problems with the size and quality of existing longitudinal data, and the statistical methods used to analyze the impact of retirement <b>on</b> <b>well-being.</b> In the paper we propose to deploy the fixed-effect estimator whichs provides consistent estimates of the effect of retirement <b>on</b> <b>well-being,</b> even when retirement is correlated with other observed and unobserved explanatory variables. Using a large (N = 4, 634) and nationally representative panel data set with elderly Danish respondents, we find that retirement does not have any significant effect <b>on</b> <b>well-being.</b> When estimating separate model for men and women we find indications (p =. 06) that men experience a decline in well-being as a consequence of retirement, while women are unaffected by retirement. Our findings for men would substantiate the crisis theory perspective that holds that retirement implies a loss of important social roles associated with labor market participation.

Using pooled data in specifications (1) to (3) and an interaction term between unemployment and its duration, I found that unemployment duration is positively associated to well-being. However, if one controls for individual fixed-effects – in specifications (4) to (6) – then duration is no longer associated to well-being. This hints {{at the fact that}} duration is associated with the individual fixed-effects but not directly with well-being. The transition matrix shown before provides evidence that staying in unemployment has no different effect <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> than staying in employment. The panel specifications (4 to 6) regress the change in well-being to the change in unemployment duration. The results show that the coefficient of duration is not significant.
