40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of spatio-temporal phase modulation {{made possible by}} resonance is investigated in detail through the analysis of an example problem. A simple family of exact solutions to the Ablowitz-Ladik equations i found to be modulationally stable in some regimes. This family of solutions is determined by fixing antiperiod <b>2</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>conditions,</b> which determines two wavenumbers. Within the family of solutions, the frequencies do not depend on amplitude; this feature ensures that the antiperiod <b>2</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>conditions</b> will be enforced under modulation. The family of solutions is described by four parameters, two being actions that foliate the phase space, and two being macroscopically observable functions of the phase constants. The modulation of the actions is described by a closed hyperbolic system of first order equations, {{which is consistent with}} the full set of four genus 1 modulation equations. The modulation of the phase information, easily observed ue to the presence of two resonances, i described by two more equations that are driven by the actions. The results are confirmed by numerical experiments. 1. Introduct ion In the study of linear dispersive waves, one often asks about the behavior of waves in a slowly varying medium.

40|$|The Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP 2) is an {{international}} collaboration to simulate the climate of the mid-Pliocene interglacial, corresponding to marine isotope stage KM 5 c (3. 205 Mya), using {{a wide selection of}} climate models with the objective of understanding the nature of the warming that is known to have occurred during the broader mid-Pliocene warm period. PlioMIP 2 builds on the successes of PlioMIP by shifting the focus to a specific interglacial and using a revised set of geographic and orbital boundary conditions.

40|$|In this paper, the {{characterization}} of laminar convective heat transfer in rhombic shaped microchannel with H 1 (axially constant heat flux and circumferentially constant temperature) and H 2 (constant axial and circumferential wall heat flux) boundary conditions is presented. A three-dimensional numerical model is developed for hydrodynamically and thermally developing flow in different rhombic geometries with side-angles varying from 10 degrees to 90 degrees. The numerical model is first validated with the other model developed in the literature for rectangular geometry and subsequently the results are compared with rhombic channel with different side-angles. This model is then extended to determine the temperature and heat flux distributions in rhombic microchannel, {{which is used to}} find the local and hydrodynamically and thermally fully developed Nusselt numbers. It is found that the fully developed Nusselt number varies only with the side-angles of rhombic channel and generalized correlations are developed as a function of side-angles for H 1 and H <b>2</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>conditions.</b> Correlations for developing length, local and fully-developed Nusselt numbers for rhombic channels are currently not available.

40|$|We {{consider}} the logarithmic minimal models LM(1, p) as ‘rational’ logarithmic conformal field theories with extended W symmetry. To {{make contact with}} the extended picture starting from the lattice, we identify 4 p − <b>2</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>conditions</b> as specific limits of integrable boundary conditions of the underlying Yang–Baxter integrable lattice models. Specifically, we identify 2 p integrable boundary conditions to match the 2 p known irreducible W-representations. These 2 p extended representations naturally decompose into infinite sums of the irreducible Virasoro representations (r, s). A further 2 p− 2 reducible yet indecomposable W-representations of rank 2 are generated by fusion and these decompose as infinite sums of indecomposable rank- 2 Virasoro representations. The fusion rules in the extended picture are deduced from the known fusion rules for the Virasoro representations ofLM(1, p) and are found to be in agreement with previous works. The closure of the fusion algebra on a finite number of representations in the extended picture is remarkable confirmation of the consistency of the lattice approach. PACS number: 11. 25.
