5000|$|Double-acting {{cylinders}} {{have been}} infrequently used for internal combustion engines since, although Burmeister & Wain made <b>2-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> double-acting (2-SCDA) diesels for marine propulsion before 1930.

5000|$|Clerk {{began work}} on his own engine designs in October 1878 after modifying a Brayton engine with a spark plug. George Brayton. Brayton engines ( [...] called [...] "Ready Motors" [...] were made from 1872 - 1876) and {{were one of the}} first engines to {{successfully}} use compression and combust fuel in the cylinder. Prior to this time the commercial engines available had been the Lenoir engine from 1860, a non - compression engine which worked on a double-acting <b>2-stroke</b> <b>cycle,</b> but spent half of each stroke drawing gas into the cylinder. The Hugon engine was a slightly improved version, but both were quite inefficient (95 and 85 cubic feet of gas per HP hour respectively). The next commercial engine available (from 1867) was the Otto & Langen a non compression, free piston engine, which used atmospheric pressure for the power stroke, and consumed about 1/2 the gas of the Lenoir and Hugon engines. It was in May 1876 that Otto developed his engine using the single-acting 4-stroke cycle with compression in the cylinder. Clerk decided to develop an engine using compression, but with the <b>2-stroke</b> <b>cycle,</b> as he could see benefit to weight and smoothness of operation through having twice as many power strokes.|$|E

50|$|The Engines & Energy Conversion Laboratory (EECL) {{is housed}} in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. The {{laboratory}} {{was established in the}} Old Fort Collins Power Plant in June 1992. In the years since then the laboratory has grown {{to become one of the}} largest and most influential engines research programs in the United States. The EECL is widely recognized as an international leader in the fields of large gas engines for power generation and compression, small <b>2-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> engines for use in developing countries, alternative fuels for automobiles, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling of engines, and optical combustion diagnostics. The Department has invested in the laboratory through hiring faculty members who have established new EECL programs in diesel engines, laser diagnostics, and plasma applications in engines.|$|E
5000|$|Lemuel Wright is also {{responsible}} {{for one of the}} very early patents for internal combustion engines, British patent number 6525 of 1833. One of the earliest sources to describe his engine and patent is the scientist and engineer Dugald Clerk (later Sir Dugald Clerk FRS) in his book [...] "Gas and Oil Engines" [...] first published in 1886. Dugald Clerk is the creator of the first commercial engine operating on the <b>2-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> with in-cylinder compression, and is often considered to be the originator of the modern 2-stroke engine. In summarising the importance of patents prior to 1860 (when the internal combustion became a commercial reality), Clerk states : [...] "The greatest credit is due to Wright and Barnett. Wright very closely proposed the modern non-compression system, Barnett the modern compression system.".|$|E
5000|$|Clerk's initial {{experiment}} with a Brayton ready motor in 1878 {{led him to}} make improvements that would eventually result {{in the development of}} the 2 stroke cycle. Clerks engine used compression and a novel system of ignition", one of these was exhibited in July 1879. However it was not until the end of 1880 that he succeeded in producing the Clerk engine operating on the <b>2-stroke</b> <b>cycle,</b> which became the commercial product. Clerk states [...] "The Clerk engine at present in the market was the first to succeed in introducing compression of this type, combined with ignition at every revolution many attempts had previously been made by other inventors, including Mr. Otto and the Messrs. Crossley, but all had failed in producing a marketable engine. It is only recently that the Messrs. Crossley have made the Otto engine in its twin form and so succeeded in getting impulse at every turn." ...|$|E

50|$|CI {{engines that}} use a blower {{typically}} use uniflow scavenging. In this design the cylinder wall contains several intake ports placed uniformly spaced along the circumference {{just above the}} position that the piston crown reaches when at BDC. An exhaust valve or several like that of 4-stroke engines is used. The final part of the intake manifold is an air sleeve which feeds the intake ports. The intake ports are placed at an horizontal angle to the cylinder wall (I.e: they are in plane of the piston crown) to give a swirl to the incoming charge to improve combustion. The largest reciprocating IC are low speed CI engines of this type; they are used for marine propulsion (see marine diesel engine) or electric power generation and achieve the highest thermal efficiencies among internal combustion engines of any kind. Some Diesel-electric locomotive engines operate on the <b>2-stroke</b> <b>cycle.</b> The most powerful of them have a brake power of around 4.5 MW or 6,000 HP. The EMD SD90MAC class of locomotives use a 2-stroke engine. The comparable class GE AC6000CW whose prime mover has almost the same brake power uses a 4-stroke engine.|$|E
5000|$|In 1974, Rokon {{produced}} the RT340 TCR Automatic, using a snowmobile-type Salsbury CVT, {{rear wheel drive}} only, and dual disc brakes. Another unusual feature was a pull cord to start the engine. The transmission freewheels with the engine at idle; starts to engage about 2800 RPM; and is tuned so the engine always runs near peak power, at 6,000 to 6,700 RPM. The lowest gear ratio is 3.76:1 and highest 0.87:1. Using a CVT allows a use of a <b>2-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> motor with higher power but narrow power band. The engine sound is unusual as the engine stays at a nearly fixed speed and the transmission ratio changes according to speed. The transmission freewheels when not driving forward, {{so there is no}} engine braking. The transmission is vented to the outside for cooling, and so is contaminated by stream crossings and other environmental exposure. Water causes slipping but quickly goes away; however grit can cause transmission sticking. Riding on loose surfaces is sometimes complicated, as rear wheel breakaway does not cause telltale changes in the engine sound. However, most other riding is intuitive and sometimes much more convenient as the automatic avoids engine stalls and other problems with gear selection. Operation is loud (90.3 dB(A)) as the engine is always running fast except at idle. Despite low front wheel weight, about 43%, it had trouble pulling wheelies, a problem for Enduro riding. Prototypes were raced by factory riders from 1971 to 1973 under Tom Clark; [...] "TCR" [...] stands for [...] "Tom Clark Replica". In the 48th annual six-days trial, all four riders earned bronze medals for finishing. [...] "Cycle Guide" [...] test riders reported it superior for hill climbing and fast on hard surfaces, but poor on loose surfaces and descending hills.|$|E
