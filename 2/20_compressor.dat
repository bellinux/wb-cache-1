The accurate pediction of the interaction requires consistency of the interface boundary conditions with the time levels of integration of the fluid and the structure equations. If staggered algorithms are used, the time delay causes non-physical energy dissipation in the system which modifies the calculated aeroelastic behaviour. In order to be compatible, the equations must be integrated simultaneously and implicitly. These {{techniques are}} tested on a standard aeroelastic airfoil problem, and then applied to the direct coupling of an assembly of <b>20</b> <b>compressor</b> blades performing torsional vibrations...|$|E

For no noise constraint and without a suppressor, the best dry turbojet gave a payload of 9. 0 percent of gross weight and a sideline noise of 126 effective perceived noise decibels. Payload dropped rapidly for lower noise goals, becoming 6. 3 percent of gross weight at FAR 36. At FAR 36, the turbojet with suppressor gave a payload of 8. 3 percent and the turbojet with ideal rotary flow inductor, 7. 3 percent.

The gasturbine has a nominal speed of 500 krpm, a nominal air flow of 20 g/s and a nominal pressure ratio of 3.

40|$|Transport {{refrigeration}} {{contributes to}} anthropogenic global warming directly because of leakage of refrigerant, usually using high {{global warming potential}} (GWP) refrigerants, and indirectly because of the greenhouse gases emitted in driving the vehicle and the refrigeration system. A hybrid jet-pump CO 2 compression system is being designed for transport refrigeration so that the GWP {{of the system is}} reduced and its performance improved. The jet-pump utilises waste heat from the exhaust gases of the engine to subcool the refrigerant and so enhance performance, reduce energy required from the engine and minimise GWP of the system. The hybrid jet-pump CO 2 compression system has been simulated and its performance determined for different operating conditions and optimised using entropy generation minimisation. At an evaporator temperature of - 18 °C, an ambient temperature of 35 °C and a generator temperature of 120 °C, the COP increases from about 1. 0 to 2. 27 as the degree of subcooling increases from 0 K to <b>20</b> K.

40|$|Aerospace {{technology}} {{plays an}} important role in the modern scientific research and engineering applications. Most energy consumed by equipment inside the spacecraft is converted into waste heat. Current thermal control and management technology research for international aerospace has made considerable progress. Vapor compression heat pump is an important aerospace thermal control means to lunar probe program and deep space exploration. Compressors are the most important components in vapor compression heat pump systems. How to improve the performance of aerospace refrigeration compressors is a key technology. Micro-gravity environment has a great impact on system performance. For the study of the performance of compressor and heat pump system under micro-gravity environment, a test bed for the gravity independence of space-borne vapor compression heat pump system is designed and built. The test system of gravity independence mainly consists of three parts: refrigerant cycle system, water cycle system and data acquisition system. The paper tests the gravity independence of rotary compressor performance, and evaluates the performance of compressor and heat pump system in micro-gravity environment. The results show that when the control voltage of compressor speed is 2 V, the maximum tilt angle is about 60 ° under the condition of low speed operation. The inclination angle of compressor has little effect on evaporation and condensation pressure. Evaporation and condensation pressure is 4. 3 bar and 12 bar, respectively, and the pressure ratio is steady. Energy efficiency ratio and coefficient of performance are about 3. 3 and 4. 2, respectively. Under the condition of the maximum tilt angle of 60 °, the system could run in the compressor speed control range of 1 - 3. 5 V. There’s a balance point when the control voltage is 1 - 2 V, and the maximum of energy efficiency ratio and coefficient of performance are 3. 1 and 4. 0, respectively. When the voltage is 2. 5 - 3. 5 V, the compressor suction and exhaust temperature is difficult to stabilize, showing a periodical rise and fall. If the voltage is more than 3. 5 V, the compressor stops to run for self-protection. Under the condition that the compressor works in full, the maximum tilt angle is 20 °. When the tilt angle is less than <b>20</b> °, the <b>compressor</b> is under normal operation; when the tilt angle is more than <b>20</b> °, the <b>compressor</b> can not continue to maintain the operation, resulting in downtime. When the tilt angel is less than 20 °, the performance parameters do not change with the increase of the inclination angle. Evaporation and condensation pressure stabilize at 4. 2 and 13 bar, respectively. Energy efficiency ratio and coefficient of performance are about 2. 7 and 3. 6, respectively. Under the condition of the tilt angle of 15 °, as the control voltage increases from 1. 5 to 5 V, the energy efficiency ratio decreases from 3. 5 to 2. 7, and the coefficient of performance drops from 4. 2 to 3. 6...|$|R
40|$|Freeze {{pre-concentration}} system, FPCS, {{with low}} lift reversible heat pump {{is designed for}} selective freezing of water from sugarcane juice. Â Two identical vented double wall tube-and-tube heat exchangers are used, to freeze water in the evaporator and melt ice in the condenser, alternately. Â They are sized based on cooling capacity offered by compressor, ice growth rate and velocity of juice inside the tube to reduce inclusion. Â Low lift heat pump is designed to operate at - 8 oC evaporator and 3 oC condenser saturation temperatures. Â Since, the condenser duty is higher than evaporator duty excess heat duty, {{in the form of}} superheat is utilized to heat pre-concentrated juice. Â Raw juice is precooled in a three stream Tube-and-Tube Heat Exchanger, TT_HE. Â Raw juice is precooled using cool concentrated juice and separated water. Â Freeze pre-concentration of sugarcane juice from 20 Â°Brix to 40 Â°Brix using a low lift reversible heat pump saves bagasse during initial 63 % water removal. Â Water is removed through the freezing process requires 335 kJ/kg heat removal, which is equivalent to 15 % of heat addition during evaporation at atmospheric pressure in open pan in jaggery making. Â Investigations on selection of refrigerant R 744, R 290 and R 22 for FPCS are presented. Â R 290 is identified as preferred refrigerant. Â It is natural refrigerant, no ODP and significantly lower operating pressures compared to R 744. Â R 290 charge of 360 g for 1. 5 TR compressor based system is managed by using small diameter refrigerant side tubes. Â It address safety related issues for modular small capacity systems. Â Superheat temperature of compressed refrigerant is 9 oC for R 290. Â It allows to size the identical LHEs with R 290 as a refrigerant. Â Flashing of refrigerant in evaporator is 7 % for R 290 and 10 % R 744. Â Generally, R 744 is preferred when high temperature heating is required. Â But, high superheat at compressor outlet and increased flashing at evaporator inlet reduces the performance of R 744 system making it less preferred as compared to R 290 and R 22. Â Theoretical cycle COPc calculated for R 290 based reversible heat pump works out to be <b>20,</b> with <b>compressor</b> isentropic efficiency of 70 %. Â Overall system COPc is in the range of 10 to 13 after accounting for losses like cycling of thermal mass, heat gain from ambient, variation in freezing point depression and ice layer thickness. Â System Carnot efficiency is in the range of 41 to 54 %. Â Power required for 1. 5 TR FPCS is 0. 4 to 0. 6 kWe. Â Different juice side tube diameters are considered to find the optimal size, after accounting for effect of thermal mass of heat exchanger, heat pump switching time and inclusion on the energy consumption per unit water separated. Â Achievable energy consumption is in the range of 9 to 12 kWhe/m 3 of water separated...|$|R
