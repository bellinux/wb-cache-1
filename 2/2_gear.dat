Cod catches of the vessels in the gear groups BT 2 (beam trawl) and TR (otter trawls and seines) need to be monitored yearly, due to the Dutch implementation of the European cod recovery plan. The European cod recovery plan restricts fishing efforts of European fleets that catch cod. Fishing effort, based on historical track records, is allocated to different gear groups. Fishing effort can be transferred between gear groups but then conversion factors apply. In the Netherlands fishing effort is transferred yearly from the BT <b>2</b> <b>gear</b> group to the TR group, based on a national conversion factor of 1 : 3 (BT:TR) kWdays instead of the European conversion factor of 1 : 16, because the cod catches in the Dutch TR fleet are not as high as the European conversion factor implies.

40|$|Hexoses {{accumulate}} to {{high concentrations}} (~ 200 mM) in storage parenchyma cells of tomato fruit. Hexoses are sourced from the fruit apoplasm as hydrolysis products of phloem-imported sucrose. Three hexose transporters (LeHT 1, LeHT 2, LeHT 3), expressed in fruit storage parenchyma cells, {{may contribute to}} hexose uptake by these cells. An analysis of their full-length sequences demonstrated that all three transporters belong to the STP sub-family of monosaccharide transporters that localize to plasma membranes. Heterologous expression of LeHT 1 (and previously LeHT <b>2,</b> <b>Gear</b> et al., 2000), but not LeHT 3, rescued a hexose transport-impaired yeast mutant when raised on glucose or fructose as the sole carbon source. Biochemically, LeHT 1, similarly to LeHT 2, exhibited transport properties consistent with a highaffinity glucose/H⁺ symporter. Significantly, LeHT 1 and LeHT 2 also functioned as low-affinity fructose/H⁺ symporters with apparent Km values commensurate with those of fruit tissues. A substantial reduction (80 – 90 %) in fruit expression levels of all LeHT genes by RNAi-mediated knockdown caused a 55 % decrease in fruit hexose accumulation. In contrast, photoassimilate production by source leaves and phloem transport capacity to fruit were unaffected by transporter knockdown. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that LeHTs play key roles in driving accumulation of hexoses into storage parenchyma cells during tomato fruit development...|$|E

40|$|With the {{projected}} growth of wind {{energy in the}} United States expected to account for 20 % of the energy portfolio by 2030, it can be expected that wind turbines will not only increase in number, but also in size. This increase in size implies that internal components, such as the gearbox, will also increase to handle the higher loads. And given the high failure rates for gearbox components already in existence, one could expect more failure if nothing is done to improve reliability. It {{is well known that}} wind loading is not constant, rather it is random and ultimately causes fatigue loading. This thesis is concerned with studying what the effects of dynamic loading are on a smaller gear system. It is assumed {{the findings of this study}} can be scaled to a larger wind turbine system. A simple spur gear pair is first simulated at constant loading to establish a baseline and then run with a sinusoidal input with differing amplitudes and frequencies. The hypothesis is that by varying the amplitude and frequency, the responses for gear contact force and input and output shaft torques will also vary. And if these variations are noted, then conclusions may be drawn as how the frequency and amplitude influence the system. After which, it may then be correlated to a wind turbine system. Knowing what affects the frequency and amplitude have on a smaller system may help to establish guidelines. For this model, mechanical simulation software is used to build a multibody dynamics model of a spur gear system with flexible shafts. Using known wind data obtained near Amarillo, TX, a matrix of possible frequencies and amplitudes for a sinusoidal input are implemented and the solutions compared to those at constant loading. It was found that the system responded similarly regardless of input, showing RMS values for accelerations of approximately 50 m/s <b>2,</b> <b>gear</b> contact forces of 520 N, input shaft torques of 42 Nm, and output shaft torques of 78 Nm.

The marketing study is done by analyzing the data from Spain and European database in industrial section together with the assumption based on reality. The results from this part are the expected production per year which can let us make the decision for the machine type and it will be used in economic study as well. Then the proper manufacturing process and specific tool’s type for each part will be decided and written on the Phase Document and the Summary of the Operation. These 2 documents are in the form that suitable to be used in reality effectively. Not only the manufacturing procedure, we also indicate the proper cutting condition and the calculations of cycle time, cutting force, machine power and the quality verification for each part. The data obtained by the calculation will be used to choose the specific model of machines, the amounts of machines and workers required to achieve the expected production.

40|$|Trawling {{has been}} {{controversial}} since its introduction in the 17 th century. In 1882 the Fishery Board for Scotland was established and assigned powers to ban beam and otter trawling where {{necessary to protect}} traditional static gear fisheries. Under these powers, {{large parts of the}} inshore waters off the east and west coasts of Scotland were closed to trawling. The Firth of Clyde remained closed until 1962. More recently, in April 2015 solicitors acting for Greenpeace obtained High Court permission for a judicial review of Defra’s alleged failure to adjust its policy on allocating annual landing quotas to reflect reforms to the CFP. It is claimed the reforms stipulate that greater preference should be given to sustainable low impact fishing methods at the expense of high-impact methods such as trawling. In Scotland, the exclusion of trawling activity from a network of marine protected areas established in July 2015 has also been highly controversial. There is no doubt that some trawl gears can be extremely destructive of fragile habitats and slowly regenerating fauna such as coral. Over expanses of mud or sand, however, it has been claimed that trawling may be a positive factor, akin to ploughing the fields in terrestrial agriculture, and enhancing the productivity of the ecosystem. There have been many scientific studies, both in the field and using mathematical modelling, of the impact of trawling on the seabed. Similarly, we know very well that harvesting of fish and shellfish, whether using trawling or static gear, has consequences for marine food webs. However, there have been few, if any, scientific studies which have put these two aspects of trawling together and then compared the seabed impacts of trawling with the consequences of harvesting. In this project we used a mathematical model to compare and contrast the whole ecosystem effects of harvesting fish and shellfish with the consequences of other aspects of trawling activity, especially the ploughing of seabed habitats. The model is not detailed to the level of individual species or exact locations. Rather it gives results at the level of a whole regional sea area, such as the North Sea or the whole of the west of Scotland. The project had three main components. First, was the extension of an existing mathematical model of a marine ecosystem to include explicit representation of the ploughing effects that different gears have on seabed habitats. Second, an analysis of a large international data set on activity, landings and catches by different fishing gears in northwest European waters, and the mapping of these onto different seabed habitats to generate inputs to the model. Finally, we carried out a series of sensitivity experiments with the model. These experiments investigated the whole ecosystem effects of seabed ploughing by different gears, using food web indicators relevant to the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, and compared them with the impact of one scenario for implementing a landing obligation, and the potential impacts of a reduction in overall fishing activity. For the North Sea, the results show that even if all ploughing effects were eliminated, the effects on the whole ecosystem would be equivalent to only a 1 % or less change in overall harvesting rate of fish and shellfish. This is a very small effect compared to the changes in effective harvesting rate implied by the improvements in gear selectivity required to achieve the landing obligation. For the west of Scotland region, the model showed that the food web was more sensitive to the effects of ploughing by fishing gears than in the North Sea, but the effect was still small compared to the consequences of activity reduction overall. The greater sensitivity of the west of Scotland to seabed ploughing arose because the disturbance rate of muddy sediments was around 5 -times higher than in the North Sea, almost entirely due to the activities of TR 2 Nephrops trawling. Despite our conclusion that the regional scale food web effects of seabed ploughing are small compared to the primary consequences of harvesting fish, {{this is not to say}} that there are no effects on regional biodiversity, or significant effects at local scales on specific habitats or vulnerable species. In particular the study identifies the TR <b>2</b> <b>gear</b> fleet as being responsible for the majority of ecosystem-wide consequences of seabed ploughing. This gear has a particularly high ploughing rate and its activity is focussed on muddy sediments where the nutrient chemistry processes are more vulnerable to ploughing than in sandy and coarser sediments...|$|E
