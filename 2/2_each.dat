25|$|The {{most common}} and {{symmetric}} plane drawing of the Petersen graph, as a pentagram within a pentagon, has five crossings.

On a torus the Petersen graph can be drawn without edge crossings; it therefore has orientable genus 1.|$|E

Europe’s allocation was reduced from 5 to 4.5 (although it effectively increased to 5.5 because of the automatic qualification of the host nation). The North/Central American and Caribbean confederation (CONCACAF) retained their 2.5 qualifiers, Africa and South America <b>2</b> <b>each,</b> and Oceania 1. The 16th qualifying spot was determined through a play-off between the third-placed team in CONCACAF and the winner of repechage play-offs in Europe.|$|E
