50|$|Acrylates are the salts, esters, and {{conjugate}} {{bases of}} acrylic acid and its derivatives. They are {{also known as}} propenoates (since acrylic acid {{is also known as}} <b>2-propenoic</b> <b>acid).</b> The acrylate ion has the molecular formula CH2=CHCOOâˆ’. Acrylates contain vinyl groups, that is, two carbon atoms double bonded to each other, directly attached to the carbonyl carbon.|$|E
