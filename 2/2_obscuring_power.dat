40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{possibilities}} for normative grounding of authority through {{a focus on the}} relationship between Habermas’s ‘critical theory’ and Gadamer’s ‘philosophical hermeneutics’, with particular reference to the bases of authority in East Asian culture. More specifically, it examines the role of reason and tradition in justifying political authority. Gadamer’s philosophical hermeneutics locates the conditions of authority in tradition, constituted in part by prejudice, while Habermas offers a theory of communicative action that transcends the limited horizons of tradition. The distinction between reason and tradition is applied in East Asian culture through an analysis of the practice of filial piety. The thesis endorses Habermas’s charge that Gadamer hypostatizes tradition. Habermas correctly identifies the political implication of Gadamer’s philosophical hermeneutics, namely, that it <b>obscures</b> <b>power</b> relations. It is argued that Habermas’s ‘communicative action theory’ and ‘discourse ethics’ are better able to do justice to the basis for the normative grounding of authority.

However, its underlying mechanism in immunomodulation is still unclear. Although immunomodulatory Chinese Medicinal herbs have been used extensively in basic research or clinic, there are still many problems that hinder its popularity in the world.

The current study provides a quantitative assay for the marker compound, salidroside, in an R. algida extract for ensuring the extraction method used in the following experiments.

Biological assay indicated that R. algida stimulates human peripheral blood lymphocytes and the underlying immunomodulating effects might be through its regulation of IL- 2 in Th 1 cells and IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 10 in Th 2 cells. In summary, R. algida is a Chinese herb with potential to regulate human immune responses through modulating both Th 1 and Th 2 immunities.

The high spectroscopic completeness of the GAMA survey makes it ideal for a comprehensive analysis of the close environment of galaxies. To exploit this, and conduct a comparative analysis of the environment of broad and narrow line AGN within GAMA, we use a double-Gaussian emission line fitting method to model the more complex line profiles associated with broad line AGN. We select 209 type 1 (i. e., unobscured), 464 type 1. 5 - 1. 9 (partially obscured), and 281 type <b>2</b> (<b>obscured)</b> AGN within the GAMA II database. Comparing the fractions of these with neighbouring galaxies out to a pair separation of 350 kpc h- 1 and delta z < 0 : 012 shows no difference between AGN of different type, except at separations less than 20 kpc h- 1 where our observations suggest an excess of type 2 AGN in close pairs.

Further to this we find that sigma 5 is also consistent between broad and narrow line AGN. We conclude that the observations presented here are consistent with AGN unification...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{marketing}} academy arguably {{holds an}} influential position within society, yet culturally speaking, {{very little is}} known about it; its people, processes or knowledge. Regardless of its privileged situation, we remain reflexively impoverished in terms of disciplinary self-understanding. This study, in some small way, hopes to change that. Indeed espousing and pursuing import around its scholarly intervention, this research instigates questions of a reflective nature, around marketing academia. More specifically, taking an anti-foundational perspective, it seeks to explore processes of knowledge production within the discipline. Having reviewed current approaches to the evaluation of knowledge production from within marketing and beyond, this study comes to suggest a disciplinary lacking with regard to reflexive understandings, through marketing’s; (1) lack of consideration around knowledge as practice and (2) unsatisfactory consideration of the academic ‘subject’ therein. With this in mind, it located a more precise interest around ‘the marketing academic’ and specifically, subjectivity formation, within a doctoral process of a major UK University. It was believed that this focus would provide a potentially revelatory means for generating new and responsible understandings into the conditions and effects of our disciplinary (re) production. To this end, having theorised and analysed subjectivity formation through a Foucauldian lens (‘subjectification’, 1983) this study came to produce five main conclusions. These included suggestions that (1) ‘the self’ was constituted, not inherent (despite dominant evaluatory positions to the contrary), (2) subjective reproduction within the site included ‘independence’ and ‘knowledgability’ (3) the rhetoric of independence served to <b>obscure</b> <b>power</b> relations and everyday interactions within the doctoral process (4) problematic power relations, in part, defined the supervisory relationship, and that (5) effects of training were both positively and negatively experienced by informants...|$|R
40|$|The route by {{a network}} of narrators from {{different}} eras finds a trace of animality in the look and in the flâneur writing, since Restif de La Bretonne proposed, in the eighteenth century, the similarity between the reporter/narrator and a night bird. This track permits that one proposes the category of the owl-narrator, which puts into practice an inhuman method {{of looking at the}} shadow areas of the cities. Here considered as narratives of the dark, this cartography runs several textualities intertwined by the desire to see what is beneath the everyday life – from Bretonne and Mercier, through Poe, Baudelaire, João do Rio and arriving to Clarice Lispector. Sometimes, the owl narrative disappears to resurge in every city where there is a stubborn wanderer who overcomes the invisibility spot on the human eye. The crowds go ahead inattentively, overshadowed by the proliferation of signs and advertisements, they march to the future without looking back. The owl does not; it retains the time to envision the disappearance of singularities and to foresee what the today story points out as more clandestine. As claims Benjamin (1994, p. 231), “thinking not only includes the movement of ideas, but also their immobilization”. The walk by the early writer-reporters allows us to consider that the owl-flâneur inaugurates not only himself, but also this kind of narrative based on a poetic of looking to the rubble. The physical roaming characterizes it, but does not determine the narrative, as it does not determine the trip, the inner displacement. Mostly, the impulse to see the unknown awakens other <b>obscured</b> <b>powers,</b> reintegrating them to the perception of the urban movements and driving the narrative to walk, to hear, to smell, to feel.
