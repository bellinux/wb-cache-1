40|$|A {{concept for}} {{improving}} the performance of propulsion systems in expendable and single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) launch vehicles much like the X 33 /RLV has been identified. The approach is to utilize densified cryogenic liquid hydrogen (LH 2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) propellants to fuel the propulsion stage. The primary benefit for using this relatively high specific impulse densified propellant mixture is the subsequent reduction of the launch vehicle gross lift-off weight. Production of densified propellants however requires specialized equipment to actively subcool both the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to temperatures below their normal boiling point. A propellant densification unit based on an external thermodynamic vent principle which operates at subatmospheric pressure and supercold temperatures provides a means for the LH 2 and LOX densification process to occur. To demonstrate the production concept for the densification of the liquid hydrogen propellant, a system comprised of a multistage gaseous hydrogen compressor, LH 2 recirculation pumps and a cryogenic LH <b>2</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> was designed, built and tested at the NASA Lewis Research Center (LeRC).

This study investigates {{the potential for}} combining carbon dioxide (CO 2) sequestration with geothermal power production in areas with low geothermal resource temperatures. Using sequestered CO 2 as the working fluid or heat transfer fluid, power production of a Direct Single-Loop System and Binary Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) System were simulated using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) and the ASHRAE reference state for thermophysical properties. The two power plants were simulated {{under a variety of}} operating conditions, with the main variables being the reservoir temperature (100 ºC- 150 ºC), the mass flow rate of the CO 2 (70 kg/s, 90 kg/s, 120 kg/s, 140 kg/s), the reservoir depth (2. 5 km, 3. 1 km, 3. 6 km), and the condensing temperature. The condensing temperature was taken as the monthly average ambient wet-bulb temperature for the summer months of April through September and dry-bulb temperature for the remaining months of the year at Minneapolis, Minnesota. Results showed that using CO 2 for geothermal power production is a viable possibility.

40|$|Supercritical CO 2 (s-CO 2) Brayton {{power plants}} present {{advantages}} like {{the possibility of}} using external thermal energy sources (concentrated solar radiation or biomass combustion), high conversion efficiency at moderate temperatures, and possibly low operational and investment costs. This work stemmed from the observation that the optimization of the thermodynamic cycle and the design of the system components can be integrated into a single calculation procedure, which can be subjected to an automated constrained optimization process. The objective of this work is therefore to perform a preliminary assessment of the envisaged methodology. First, the thermodynamic analysis is performed and consists in the study of three s-CO 2 power cycle configurations. The thermal efficiency is prescribed to 50 % with a power output of 18. 7 MW respectively. The effect of the components operation on the turbine inlet temperature (TIT) and regeneration load is studied. The recompression Brayton cycle configuration allows to comply with the specified performance with the lowest turbine inlet temperature (787 C) and at moderate maximum pressure (272 bar). The operating conditions given by this analysis are used as inputs for the design of the regenerator and the cooler. The models of these heat exchangers are validated against the design and performance data of an existing s-CO <b>2</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> and well-known commercial design code. The methodology that combines the thermodynamic analysis and the components design is tested with two study cases. The first one is aimed as a first assessment of the adoption of a s-CO 2 closed Brayton gas turbine for aircraft propulsion. The s-CO 2 power system is designed such that it exceeds the performance rating of a cutting-edge turbofan, {{and at the same time}} the weight of the system is decreased as much as possible. The calculations show that the regenerators have a weight of minimum 5 tonne, which is almost the weight of the reference engine. The second study case regards the design of a power plant using a solar tower power as the heater, with the same power output and efficiency as the ones adopted for the thermodynamic analysis (18. 7 MW, 50 %). This exercise provides key characteristics of the power plant: 636 heliostats that occupy an area of 300 m 2, the regenerators weigh 17 tonne, the dry cooler also 17 tonne, TIT is 647 C, and the compressor discharge pressure is 245 bar.

40|$|Abstract––At {{the turn}} of the century, annual {{fluorocarbon}} refrigerant emissions from mobile and unitary airconditioning equipments is likely to pass 100, 000 metric tonnes, corresponding to a global warming impact of more than 150 million metric tonnes of CO 2. Even larger indirect CO 2 emissions result from the generation of power to drive the systems. With its use of a non-flammable and non-toxic natural fluid, the transcritical CO 2 system is a primary candidate for next-generation air-conditioning systems. This motivated the authors to design a CO 2 air-conditioning system. In this paper, the authors present Effectiveness-NTU method of thermal design of a plain-fin and tube evaporator for CO 2 airconditioning system. Using Engineering Equation Solver, the authors have proposed an optimum design of the CO 2 evaporator by parametric optimization. Generally CO <b>2</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> are designed for high refrigerant mass flux and use small-diameter tubes or extruded flat micro-channel tubes.

40|$|As part of {{the energy}} {{recovery}} {{part of the}} ROMA (Resource Optimization and recovery in the Materials industry) project, a laboratory prototype power production system is being built and completed in 2009. The laboratory prototype {{is based on a}} new technology for power production from low to medium temperature heat sources (the off gas from electrolysis cells in the aluminum industry) where CO 2 is used as a working medium in a trans-critical Rankine cycle. The laboratory rig consists of the power cycle with a prototype expander as the core unit, an air loop to provide the heat, and an ethylene glycol loop to provide condensation of the working fluid in the power cycle. As a preparation to the assembling and instrumentation of the prototype rig, a simulation and an uncertainty analysis were conducted for the prototype rig in the autumn of 2008. This report focuses on the continuation of that work by an experimental investigation of the individual loops and the components of the prototype rig. The emphasis of this investigation has been put on the air loop and the expander unit of the power cycle. This is basically because these are of great importance to the performance of the power production prototype rig. The air loop was thoroughly tested, and from the investigations it was discovered that there was an unfavorable temperature distribution of the air going into the air-to-CO <b>2</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> This is the heat exchanger where heat is provided to the power cycle. The source for this temperature maldistribution was identified, and solutions were investigated to improve on the problem without results. The reduced performance of the air loop was incorporated in a new simulation of the power cycle in order to quantify the consequences for the optimization of the power cycle. The simulation was carried out for warm air temperature of 80 °C. The new calculations showed a reduction in maximum net work output of 27 % compared to the original simulation. The optimal conditions for the power cycle were also changed {{as a consequence of the}} reduced air loop performance. The investigation of the expander unit revealed that the expander isentropic efficiency was a strong function of the pressure difference across the expander, and a weak function of the expander inlet pressure. It also revealed that overall the isentropic efficiency was much less than the value of 80 % which was used in the original simulation. A new simulation of the power cycle was carried out where the expander isentropic efficiency was incorporated as a function of the pressure difference across the expander. This function was based on the data from the expander testing. The simulation showed a reduction in maximum net work output from 225 W to about 60 W, for warm air temperature of 80 °C. The new expander characteristics also affected the optimization of the power cycle. The simulation results and the results from the prototype investigation will be important in the optimization and control procedures of the assembled prototype power production system. </p...|$|E

The main barrier for the implementation of a GSHE coupled with heat pump is the well drilling cost, therefore the potential is presented as meters to be drilled in order to install 2 types of GSHE: 1) Borehole <b>Heat</b> <b>Exchanger</b> (BHE) and <b>2)</b> Groundwater <b>Heat</b> <b>Exchanger</b> (GWHE). To assess the BHE, we used specific Heat Extraction (sHE) of sediments. To evaluate a GWHE, we used depth of groundwater table and groundwater drawdown caused by pumping water to the heat pump. The depth to be drilled ranges from 35 to 105 m in case of the BHE, while in case of the GWHE it ranges from 10 to 400 m. FONDAP/CONICYT Project 1509001...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the ASME/DOE Gen IV Task 7 Part I is to review the current {{experience}} on various high temperature reactor intermediate <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> (IHX) concepts. There are several different IHX concepts that could be envisioned for HTR/VHTR applications {{in a range of}} temperature from 850 C to 950 C. The concepts that will be primarily discussed herein are: (1) Tubular Helical Coil <b>Heat</b> <b>Exchanger</b> (THCHE); (<b>2)</b> Plate-Stamped <b>Heat</b> <b>Exchanger</b> (PSHE); (3) Plate-Fin <b>Heat</b> <b>Exchanger</b> (PFHE); and (4) Plate-Machined <b>Heat</b> <b>Exchanger</b> (PMHE). The primary coolant of the NGNP is potentially subject to radioactive contamination by the core as well as contamination from the secondary loop fluid. To isolate the radioactivity to minimize radiation doses to personnel, and protect the primary circuit from contamination, intermediate <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> (IHXs) have been proposed as a means for separating the primary circuit of the NGNP (Next Generation Nuclear Plant) or other process heat application from the remainder of the plant. This task will first review the different concepts of IHX that could be envisioned for HTR/VHTR applications in a range of temperature from 850 to 950 C. This will cover shell-and-tube and compact designs (including the platefin concept). The review will then discuss the maturity of the concepts in terms of design, fabricability and component testing (or feedback from experience when applicable). Particular attention will be paid to the feasibility of developing the IHX concepts for the NGNP with operation expected in 2018 - 2021. This report will also discuss material candidates for IHX applications and will discuss specific issues {{that will have to be}} addressed in the context of the HTR design (thermal aging, corrosion, creep, creep-fatigue, etc). Particular attention will be paid to specific issues associated with operation at the upper end of the creep regime...|$|R
40|$|The {{high cost}} of energy has {{prompted}} industry to look {{for new ways to}} reduce operating expenses. Often ignored are the large amounts of recoverable energy present in the ventilation and process airstreams discharged from the plant. The recovery methods available range from fairly simple, well-known devices that have been around for years to new sophisticated equipment that is constantly entering the marketplace. Commonly applied to plant ventilation and process airstreams are these three general energy-recovery methods: 1. Substituting source-capture hoods and high-efficiency air cleaners for exhaust ventilation systems to permit recirculation. <b>2.</b> Placing <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> in process stacks and general ventilation airstreams, and 3. Collecting hydrocarbon contaminants from process stacks and reusing or selling them.

40|$|Sulfur {{recovery}} unit (SRU) thermal reactors are negatively affected by high temperature operation. In this paper, {{the effect of}} the fuel mass fraction on the combustion and fluid flow in a SRU thermal reactor is investigated numerically. Practical operating conditions for a petrochemical corporation in Taiwan are used as the design conditions for the discussion. The simulation results show that the present design condition is a fuel-rich (or air-lean) condition and gives acceptable sulfur recovery, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) destruction, sulfur dioxide (SO 2) emissions and thermal reactor temperature for an oxygen-normal operation. However, for an oxygen-rich operation, the local maximum temperature exceeds the suggested maximum service temperature, although the average temperature is acceptable. The high temperature region must be inspected very carefully during the annual maintenance period if there are oxygen-rich operations. If the fuel mass fraction to the zone ahead of the choke ring (zone 1) is 0. 0625 or 0. 125, the average temperature in the zone behind the choke ring (zone 2) is higher than the zone 1 average temperature, which can damage the downstream <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> tubes. If the zone 1 fuel mass fraction is reduced to ensure a lower zone 1 temperature, the temperature in zone <b>2</b> and the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> section must be monitored closely and the zone <b>2</b> wall and <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> tubes must be inspected very carefully during the annual maintenance period. To determine a suitable fuel mass fraction for operation, a detailed numerical simulation should be performed first to find the stoichiometric fuel mass fraction which produces the most complete combustion and the highest temperature. This stoichiometric fuel mass fraction should be avoided because the high temperature could damage the zone 1 corner or the choke ring. A higher fuel mass fraction (i. e., fuel-rich or air-lean condition) is more suitable because it can avoid deteriorations of both zone 1 and <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> tubes. Although a lower fuel mass fraction (i. e., fuel-lean or air-rich condition) can avoid deterioration of zone 1, the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> tubes may be damaged. This paper provides a guideline for adjusting the fuel mass fraction to reduce the high temperature inside the thermal reactor and to ensure an acceptable sulfur recovery...|$|R
40|$|A {{literature}} {{survey was conducted}} to collect material properties data on all advanced high temperature materials. Three of these, Y 2 O 3 -stabilized ZrO 2, ThO 2, and ZrB 2 with additives of C and SiC were selected for further study. Stabilized ZrO 2 and ThO 2 {{were found to have}} higher temperature oxidation resistance than any metal and great potential for use in advanced biowaste resistojets. ZrO 2 has a lower electrical resistivity and sublimation and a higher creep endurance strength. ZrO 2 and ThO <b>2</b> tubular <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> electrically <b>heated</b> indirectly, were evaluated in short tests to about 1900 K in flowing CO 2. ZrO 2 was subjected to N 2, H 2, H 2 O and vacuum as well. X-ray diffraction and fluorescence analyses were made.

40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> which task is {{to recycle}} or store energy, has been used {{a lot in the}} process {{industry}} and in everyday appliance, such as radiators in cars or as heating in a living room. There is a lot of theoretical physics associated with <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> which make them suitable for studying purposes. To obtain high heat transfer rate it is necessary to develop turbulent flow. High heat transfer rate in a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> will always be at the expense of pressure loss. Therefore, it will be an optimization process to achieve the best <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> With today’s technology, it is usual to do this optimization using simulation programs, which makes the process far less expensive. The aim for the thesis was to develop, build and verify a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> suitable for studying purposes. It should have a simple design, which makes it possible to analyze the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> manually. The double pipe <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> was chosen to be the most suitable for this purpose. The <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> contains of an inner tube of copper with PVC as the annular pipe. The length of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is about 1 m with a wall thickness about <b>2</b> cm. The <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> was tested and adjusted until the system established energy balance. The system got tested with different flow rates to give different variations between turbulent and laminar flow in the inner and annular pipe. The results from the experiment were compared with a theoretical model developed in Microsoft Office Excel and a CFD - model from SolidWorks Flow Simulation. When the mass flow was turbulent, the deviations of outlet temperature was about 0, 1 K. At laminar flow, the difference increased to 1 K for the theoretical model. The CFD – model was simulated at default settings, achieved by the project wizard in SolidWorks Flow Simulation. The results show that the model provides good estimates for laminar flow, but is not adequate for turbulent flow. This means it requires more manipulation to get great results for an doble pipe <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> with high Reynolds number. It is shown that the models have an overall great equality to the experiments. The theoretical model is best suitable for turbulent flow and CFD - model provides good estimates for laminar flow.

40|$|Micromachined Joule-Thomson (J-T) coolers have {{applications}} {{ranging from}} cryosurgery to cooling infrared detectors. With {{the absence of}} cold moving parts, the J-T coolers can be implemented with simple structures that are suitable for silicon/glass microfabrication. The investigation proposed in this thesis focuses {{on the development of}} micromachined Si/glass <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> used in the J-T coolers that operate at 200 - 225 K when the gas pressure is 1 - <b>2</b> MPa. The <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> must maintain good stream-to-stream heat conductance between the high- and low-pressure streams while restricting stream-wise conduction to achieve a high effectiveness. Two <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> were designed, fabricated and tested. The first, a planar design, uses rows of high-conductivity silicon fins bonded onto a 100 µm thick low-conductivity glass base plate. It was fabricated using a five-mask process including Si/glass/Si anodic bonding, two-step DRIE, and HF glass etching, etc. The second, a perforated-plate design, uses numerous silicon plates alternated with glass spacers. It was fabricated using a four-mask process including KOH on (110) silicon wafers, HF glass etching and anodic bonding. Platinum resistance temperature detectors were integrated into the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> for in-situ temperature sensing. Whereas the performance of the planar <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> was limited by its ability to accommodate a pressure differential across the base plate, the perforated-plate <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> demonstrated a high effectiveness (0. 912) in at 237 - 252 K in effectiveness tests and good robustness at high pressures (1 MPa) in J-T self-cooling tests. The temperature distribution along the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> was measured by integrated resistance temperature detectors with sensitivities of 0. 26 - 0. 30 %/K at 205 - 296 K. A J-T system using the perforated-plate <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> achieved 218. 7 K at steady state and 200. 3 K in a transient state. The system provided 200 mW cooling power at 228 K and 1 W at 239 K with an estimated parasitic heat load of 300 - 500 mW. Finally, a flow-controlled J-T system using a perforated-plate <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> and a piezoelectric microvalve was demonstrated. By modulating the flow, the microvalve could vary the cooling temperature by 5 - 8 K around the operating points, which were 254. 5 K at 430 kPa pressure difference in steady state, and 234 K at 710 kPa in transient state, without an added heat load...|$|R
