Following a review of &# 039;standard&# 039; centroid derivation algorithms, and their limitations, alternative approaches are proposed.

The PO 2 of most aquatic breathers at the cellular level is much lower, between 1 and 3 kPa.

The carotid artery (CA) in one of the predominant sites of atherosclerotic plaque formation. In this work a transparent, scaled model of an average human carotid artery (AHCA) bifurcation was constructed and steady blood flow at Re = 290 and Re = 700 was simulated using an aqueous glycerin solution.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{examine how}} invisible white privilege, {{as a form}} of racism, manifests and functions institutionally within higher education. I draw on principles from critical race theory, an inter-disciplinary field of study committed to exposing and deconstructing the multifaceted ways in which racialized identities are (and have historically been) constructed and positioned in order to maintain broad systems of oppression. Within the field of composition and rhetoric, critical race theory in particular includes the study of the socio-rhetorical construction of race and ethnicity within institutional and disciplinary contexts, and its correlation {{to the ways in which}} language and education are bound up in questions of power, dominance and authority. ^ This study responds to recurrent requests by race theorists from these disciplines for an 2 ̆ <b>2</b> <b>interrogation</b> of whiteness 2 ̆ 2 (Keating, López, Marshall 2 ̆ 6 Ryden), which necessarily includes critical examinations of how the culture of whiteness maintains racial superiority through a socially and institutionally sanctioned system of unrecognized and unacknowledged white norms. My analysis specifically focuses on texts and circumstances I encountered throughout my work as a graduate student within the field of English studies and composition and rhetoric at The University of Nebraska, Lincoln (UNL), and which I position as one possible example among many of how everyday discursive practices characteristic of such sites work to maintain and perpetuate a system of white dominance that extends well beyond its borders. Also, aside from informing the development of this project, my research into the theoretics of pedagogy, language, identity, hegemony and privilege and the relationships among these has also greatly influenced my work with non-traditional forms of academic discourse which I use here as a means of both conveying and enacting the methodology and theory of privilege I offer. Out of this study, I develop the central principle of the dissertation, that of interruption as praxis [...] -a theoretical and practice-based methodology that both exposes and disrupts self-perpetuating, inequitable systems of invisible privilege [...] - racial and otherwise. ...|$|E

Five years ago, the scope of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib was first revealed; this year, the Justice Department admitted that a single suspect was waterboarded 183 times.

First, it will likely be difficult to prove that the memos were written in bad faith. While legal scholars and other lawyers agree nearly universally that the memos represent bad legal advice, bad advice does not necessarily equate to bad-faith advice. The existence of perceptual filters and deep partisan identification may have shaped the lawyers 2 ̆ 7 views of the situation in ways that appear unfathomable to outsiders. Second, even if the Office of Professional Responsibility finds evidence of professional misconduct, there is a risk that efforts to hold the memo authors accountable will lack political legitimacy. Onlookers will also view such efforts through their own perceptual frameworks and partisan commitments, and may therefore not agree that the memo authors 2 ̆ 7 conduct deserves to be punished. In particular, this article argues that between 25 and 29 there was a redefinition of cultural commitments associated with partisan identity. In 24 there was still a broad anti-torture American identity, but that identity became fragmented by 28, with support for torture breaking along partisan lines. In time, cultural commitments may again shift to allow a united American identity that condemns torture.

40|$|A Predator drone {{attack in}} Pakistan and the 2 ̆ <b>2</b> {{enhanced}} <b>interrogation</b> techniques <b>2</b> ̆ 2 that the Bush administration used on suspected terrorists {{have at least}} one thing in common: legal advice. While advice given the Obama administration on drones has received only a partial airing, disclosure that lawyers in the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) authorized coercive interrogation after 9 / 11 has ignited a wide-ranging debate on reform and accountability. However, the volume of calls for reform has exceeded consideration of the competing values at stake. Some reformers stress the need to combat a climate of impunity with formal sanctions such as disbarment and damages. Advocates of structural reform, such as Bruce Ackerman, view sanctions as small change, and urge OLC’s makeover as an adjudicative body. Veterans of OLC reject these dramatic steps. They caution that structural changes could threaten the separation of powers. Structural changes could also detach OLC from its clients in the executive branch, transforming it into a stately mansion that requires too much maintenance to use. OLC veterans urge more measured changes, including greater transparency and a renewed commitment to stare decisis. After assessing these reform proposals, this paper suggests a model of dialogic equipoise to shape both the substance of OLC opinions and OLC’s deliberative process. While a structural makeover would actually weaken the rule of law, OLC resembles a court in its need to conserve institutional capital with two audiences: the legal community and the President. OLC can issue opinions that authorize robust responses to national security and humanitarian crises, if the President seeks ratification of executive action. To conserve OLC’s institutional capital, the model caps legal advice that expands presidential power. Just as courts preserve institutional capital with devices such as standing, mootness, and political questions, a cap will prompt OLC to marshal its institutional capital for those occasions when no alternatives will do the job...|$|R

BackgroundCardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator improves survival rates and symptoms in patients with LV systolic dysfunction but {{little is known about}} its effects on AT incidence in the same patient population. MethodsTwenty-eight consecutive HF patients who underwent device upgrade to CRT-D were included. Patients had ≥ <b>2</b> device <b>interrogations</b> in the 1 year before upgrade and ≥ 3 interrogations in the 18 - to 24 -month follow-up after upgrade. Echocardiographic parameters were assessed before and at 3 to 6 months after CRT-D. Additional observations included number of hospital stays, HF clinical status, and concomitant pharmacological therapy. By virtue of this study design, each patient served as his/her own control. Statistical analysis was performed by 2 -tailed paired ttest and with nonparametric tests where appropriate. ResultsWithin 3 months after CRT, the number of HF patients with documented AT decreased significantly from the immediate pre-CRT value and tended to decline with time. At 1 -year follow-up, 90 % of patients were AT-free compared with 14 % of patients 3 months before CRT (p < 0. 001). Furthermore, the number of AT episodes/year and their maximum duration decreased after CRT (mean ± SD; 181 ± 50 vs. 50 ± 20. 2, p < 0. 05, and 220. 8 ± 87 s vs. 28 ± 21 s, p < 0. 05, respectively). Finally, CRT was associated with improved LV ejection fraction (mean ± SD; from 26 ± 5. 3 % to 31 ± 7 %, p < 0. 001) and reduced number of HF or arrhythmia hospital stays (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Anthropogenic {{emissions}} of carbon dioxide (CO 2) into the atmosphere results in climate change and perturbations of the oceanic carbonate system. Atmospheric CO 2 concentrations have increased from pre-industrial times from land use changes, fossil fuel combustion and increasing cement production. The ocean is currently a major sink for this anthropogenic CO 2, increasing pCO 2 and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations and decreasing pH and carbonate ion concentrations. This has potential biogeochemical and ecosystem consequences. To monitor the ocean’s uptake of CO 2, identify regions of enhanced carbonate system changes, and observe the effectiveness of CO 2 emission mitigation strategies, high quality pCO 2 and pH measurements with good temporal and spatial coverage are required. This thesis presents the characterisation of novel pH and pCO 2 sensing spots which use fluorescent detection techniques, and evaluates their potential for in situ seawater deployments. The optode sensing spots were illuminated with low intensity light (0. 2 mA, 0. 72 mWatt), and the time-domain dual lifetime referencing analysis technique was applied to maximise the lifetime of the spot and reduce overall power consumption of the measurement (1. 8 Watt). The same hardware was used for both the pH and pCO <b>2</b> spot <b>interrogation,</b> thereby demonstrating the versatility of the optode. After initial calibrations over typical seawater ranges for pH and pCO 2, (pH range 7. 6 – 8. 2 and pCO 2 range 280 - 1000 ?atm) the temperature and salinity dependence of the spots was evaluated. The pH displayed both a temperature (- 0. 046 pH / °C from 5 - 25 °C) and salinity dependency (- 0. 01 pH /psu over 5 - 35), while the pCO 2 sensor showed only a temperature dependence (- 39 ?atm °C- 1). Precision of the repeated measurement of certified reference material was 0. 0074 pH and 0. 8 ?atm for the pH and pCO 2 optodes, respectively. The optodes were deployed as shipboard autonomous underway systems in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean, both important CO 2 sink regions. The successful pCO 2 data deployment produced good quality data that has been used to quantify the spatial controls on carbonate chemistry and air-sea CO 2 fluxes in the North Atlantic, and evaluate the effect of sampling rate and interpolation method on the determined flux. This thesis demonstrates the potential of these small sensors, with the ultimate aim to deploy them on ARGO floats and gliders...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this program are to design and construct a mass spectrometer {{for the analysis of}} high temperature condensed phase materials, and to use this instrument to investigate the high temperature chemistry of waste form materials. Individual mass spectrometric techniques can provide windows through which to view selected properties of materials at high temperatures, but information from several sources must be combined to obtain the larger picture. This instrument is designed to provide several types of interlaced mass spectrometric analyses from a single specimen, eliminating the uncertainties associated with combining data from several different samples analyzed in different instruments. The features that are being combined in this instrument are: (1) miniaturized sample mounting and control of sample temperature to 1, 300 C; (2) electron impact (EI) ionization of volatilized neutrals; (3) surface ionization, positive and negative ions; (4) secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), positive and negative ions; (5) ultrahigh vacuum combined with sputtering to allow surface analyses to be related to bulk composition; (6) a single mass analyzer able to sequentially analyze ions from each of the ionization modes. These features will allow the following types of information to be obtained: (1) Atomic and molecular species vaporizing from the surface, both neutral and ionic. Neutrals will predominate in almost all systems, but the positive and negative ions which do volatize give valuable insights into the condensed phase chemistry. (<b>2)</b> SIMS <b>interrogation</b> of the surface composition, with ions sputtered from the surface analyzed by mass spectrometry. A high intensity sputter ion gun will be used to clean the surface, while a lower intensity ion gun will be used for the SIMS analysis. The ultrahigh vacuum will allow the surface to be maintained in a clean configuration until the analysis can be completed. This in turn gives information concerning the bulk composition of the material. (3) This information is obtained as a function of temperature from a single sample, so the interpretation of events will be more straight forward than merging data from different instruments. There currently are two instruments operating in the laboratory that perform these functions; one for SIMS and surface ionization on high temperature samples, and the other for EI and surface ionization. These have provided valuable insights into the properties of materials at high temperatures, but there is uncertainty from the perspective that all analyses cannot be performed on the same sample and from the fact that neither can guarantee a clean surface. ...|$|R

In his acknowledgments, editor Hausladen states that 2 ̆ 2 the art of editing is to ask really good writers to contribute and then let them do what they do best. 2 ̆ 2 That may often be true, but several essays would have benefited from more rigorous editing.

That many of the collection 2 ̆ 7 s outstanding diagrams, photographs, and maps are not captioned as effectively or informatively as they could be is also disappointing. A number of them lack dates-an unfortunate omission for historically-minded readers. And readers of this journal should note that the book contains little about the Great Plains.

40|$|Topoisomerase II is {{critical}} for DNA replication, transcription and chromosome segregation and is a well validated target of anti-neoplastic drugs including the anthracyclines and epipodophyllotoxins. However, these drugs are limited by common tumor resistance mechanisms and side-effect profiles. Novel topoisomerase II-targeting agents may benefit patients who prove resistant to currently available topoisomerase II-targeting drugs or encounter unacceptable toxicities. Voreloxin is an anticancer quinolone derivative, a chemical scaffold not used previously for cancer treatment. Voreloxin is completing Phase 2 clinical trials in acute myeloid leukemia and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. This study defined voreloxin's anticancer mechanism of action as {{a critical component of}} rational clinical development informed by translational research. Biochemical and cell-based studies established that voreloxin intercalates DNA and poisons topoisomerase II, causing DNA double-strand breaks, G 2 arrest, and apoptosis. Voreloxin is differentiated both structurally and mechanistically from other topoisomerase II poisons currently in use as chemotherapeutics. In cell-based studies, voreloxin poisoned topoisomerase II and caused dose-dependent, site-selective DNA fragmentation analogous to that of quinolone antibacterials in prokaryotes; in contrast etoposide, the nonintercalating epipodophyllotoxin topoisomerase II poison, caused extensive DNA fragmentation. Etoposide's activity was highly dependent on topoisomerase II while voreloxin and the intercalating anthracycline topoisomerase II poison, doxorubicin, had comparable dependence on this enzyme for inducing G <b>2</b> arrest. Mechanistic <b>interrogation</b> with voreloxin analogs revealed that intercalation is required for voreloxin's activity; a nonintercalating analog did not inhibit proliferation or induce G 2 arrest, while an analog with enhanced intercalation was 9. 5 -fold more potent. As a first-in-class anticancer quinolone derivative, voreloxin is a toposiomerase II-targeting agent with a unique mechanistic signature. A detailed understanding of voreloxin's molecular mechanism, in combination with its evolving clinical profile, may advance our understanding of structure-activity relationships to develop safer and more effective topoisomerase II-targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an {{intermittent}} debate amongst journalists, policy-makers and academics in adversarial jurisdictions {{about the nature and}} quality of the inquisitorial tradition in criminal process. Much of the political impact of the debate in Britain has stemmed from the view asserted periodically by certain high profile figures that some form of judicial supervision of police investigation – as practised for example in France – might be introduced in England and Wales. 1 Such views tend to find expression when events call into question not just particular rules but also the underlying structures and assumptions of our adversarial tradition of criminal process. Thus in 1991 the public revelation of serious miscarriages of justice led to the appointment of a Royal Commission on Criminal Justice in which the adversarial character of the pre-trial process seemed to be a key point of <b>interrogation.</b> <b>2</b> The police view, demonstrated in a number of key cases, was that once they were clear that a suspect was guilty they had no responsibility to pursue exculpatory lines of investigation. This, combined with the failure of defence lawyers to play the extensive, autonomous investigative role the adversarial system demanded of them, encouraged some to ask whether there might not be advantages in somehow ensuring that the resources and rights of the state were devoted to pursuing exonerating as well as incriminating evidence. Given the limited empirical evidence then available on the workings of judicial supervision in practice 4 and the sometimes vehement dispute in France itself about the future of its pre-trial process and especially the juge d''instruction(examining magistrate), the proposals were perhaps not surprisingly rejected. 5 But since the mid 1990 s, British funders have begun to finance a number of empirical studies of French criminal justice. 6 This paper reports the principal findings of a empirical study primarily funded by Britain''s Economic and Social Research Council into the role of defence lawyers in France. 7 Our focus and primary theme is the developing nature of their dialogue and exchanges with key state actors such as judges, prosecutors and the police {{on the one hand and}} with clients on the other. But in so doing we aim to cast light on the broader functioning of the pre-trial process in France...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that over the past two decades, writing has been {{subjected}} to various policies, initiatives, and requirements, as 2 ̆ 2 test prep is the new order of the day 2 ̆ 2 (Schultz 2 ̆ 6 Fecho, 2005, p. 12). Student teachers are learning to teach writing in these conditions. Yet they are usually left alone {{to make sense of the}} relationships between what they learn in teacher education, and what they are permitted or encouraged to do in their placement schools. Little is known about how student teachers make sense of the rules and expectations around writing in their placement schools, and what professional judgment they believe they are allowed to exercise as they learn to teach writing. ^ Dominant policy structures can lead the next generation of teachers to maintain the status quo, replicating practices that often limit children 2 ̆ 7 s access to powerful literacy learning. To address this problem, this qualitative study examined how four student teachers, across elementary, middle and secondary schools, 2 ̆ 2 read 2 ̆ 2 the rules and expectations of their placement schools, and how they navigated the relationships of policy to practice in the teaching of writing. This study is also a practitioner inquiry into what role a first-time university supervisor played in student teachers 2 ̆ 7 sense-making process, with the goal of constructivist writing pedagogy. ^ Drawing on socio-cultural literacy theories, reflective supervision literature, and critical policy research, this study found that student teachers 2 ̆ 7 negotiation of the policies in their schools went through phases, and that unofficial policies and interpersonal relationships were important parts of the policy landscape for student teachers. Furthermore, conversations with the university supervisor framed student teachers <b>2</b> ̆ 7 <b>interrogation</b> and understandings of the rules and traditions around them, as well as their thinking about themselves as teachers of writing. Suggesting a critical policy approach within literacy education, this study implies that student teachers can see themselves as agents for change, but that this is a difficult process. It also argues for a revised role of university supervisors in teacher education, including support for 2 ̆ 2 reading 2 ̆ 2 policy along with student teachers while deepening their own knowledge-of-practice (Cochran-Smith and Lytle, 1999). ...|$|R
40|$|We {{commonly}} {{attribute to}} {{states and other}} institutional organizations moral duties and obligations. For example, it is widely held {{that the state has}} a moral duty to protect its citizens from external threats and (more contentiously) it is claimed that it ought to positively promote the welfare of its members. When we focus on the surface grammar of such institutional duty-claims, we see that they seem to differ from individual duty-claims only with respect to the subject of the claim. Whereas an institutional duty-claim asserts that an institution (e. g., the state) has a duty to do some action a, an individual duty-claim asserts that a particular individual person has a duty to a. For example, we might claim that parents ought to protect their children, or that a particular person, Doe, ought to take better care of his child. Many scholars have argued or at least assumed that institutions are ultimately just collections of individuals, and hence institutional duty-claims can be analyzed in terms of claims about individuals 2 ̆ 7 duties and obligations. Other scholars have rejected this reductive approach to institutional duty-claims as well as the individualist assumption upon which it is premised [...] viz., that institutions are nothing 2 ̆ 2 over and above 2 ̆ 2 individuals. Instead, it is argued that at least some institutional organizations are moral agents in their own right which have duties and obligations that are uniquely their own. According to this antireductive holist approach, at least some institutional duty-claims resist being analyzed into claims about individuals 2 ̆ 7 duties and obligations. My aim in this dissertation is to clarify what is meant when we assert that the state (or some other institutional organization) has moral duties, and I do so by entering into dialogue with both the reductive individualist and antireductive holist views. In Chapter One I situate and motivate my project by reference to two well-known debates in which claims about the state 2 ̆ 7 s duties play an inescapably central role; viz., the debate concerning the propriety of using so-called 2 ̆ <b>2</b> enhanced <b>interrogation</b> techniques <b>2</b> ̆ 2 in the War on Terror and the debate surrounding the most recent reforms to the health care system here in the United States. Since my aim is to shed light on the meaning of and truth-makers for institutional duty-claims, I devote Chapter Two to the task of clarifying what we mean and imply when we advance duty-claims in what we may assume to be paradigmatic circumstances: namely, those circumstances in which an individual is said to have a duty to do something or another. I then frame the further investigation into the meaning and significance of institutional duty-claims as one which has the aim of revealing whether the phrase 2 ̆ 7 has a duty 2 ̆ 7 has a univocal, analogous, or equivocal signification across institutional and individual contexts. In Chapter Three I take up the task of characterizing and distinguishing the relevant reductive individualist and antireductive holist viewpoints, considering both historically significant and contemporary versions of each. In Chapter Four I present and critically evaluate a rather influential argument in favor of institutional moral agency, which, if true, would vindicate the antireductive holist approach. I conclude that chapter by arguing that, contrary to the claims made by those who defend institutional agency, we are unjustified in believing that institutions possess those properties requisite for moral agency. Having set aside what I take to be a 2 ̆ 2 best-case 2 ̆ 2 for an antireductive holism, I turn, in Chapter Five, to the task of making plausible the reductive individualist approach. In doing so, I propose that some institutional duty-claims actually resist reduction to claims about individuals 2 ̆ 7 duties and that such claims are thus better understood as claims about the extrinsic value of an institutional arrangement...|$|R
