40|$|Abstract [...] Graphite filler {{reinforced}} polypropylene (PP) composites and talc filler reinforced (PP) composites were prepared by compression molding at 160 C. Mechanical and electrical properties were studied. The tensile {{strength of the}} composites decreases {{with the increase of}} filler addition and also with the increase of wt. % of filler. But, a slight improvement of the Young's modulus of the filaments reinforced with different wt. % of filler is observed. It was found that the Bulk density of test materials increased with the fillers content. Capacitance decreases with the increase of both frequency and voltage which suggest good electrical properties of PP-graphite composites and PP-talc composites. All of these results indicated that PP-graphite composites are better than the PP-talc <b>composites.</b> <b>Index</b> <b>Term</b> [...] Reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites, mechanical properties, electrical properties, Young’s modulus and bulk density. 1...|$|R

40|$|Some {{aspects of}} an obese body habitus may protect against {{fracture}} risk (higher bone mineral density [BMD] and greater tissue padding), while others may augment that risk (greater impact forces during a fall). To examine these competing pathways, we analyzed {{data from a}} multisite, multiethnic cohort of 1924 women, premenopausal or early perimenopausal at baseline. Obesity was defined as baseline body mass index (BMI) [*]>[*] 30 [*]kg/m <b>2.</b> <b>Composite</b> <b>indices</b> of femoral neck strength relative to fall impact forces were constructed from DXA‐derived bone size, BMD and body size. Incident fractures were ascertained annually during a median follow‐up of 9 years. In multivariable linear regression adjusted for covariates, higher BMI was associated with higher BMD but with lower <b>composite</b> strength <b>indices,</b> suggesting that although BMD increases with greater skeletal loading, the increase {{is not sufficient to}} compensate for the increase in fall impact forces. During the follow‐up, 201 women had fractures. In Cox proportional hazard analyses, obesity was associated with increased fracture hazard adjusted for BMD, consistent with greater fall impact forces in obese individuals. Adjusted for <b>composite</b> <b>indices</b> of femoral neck strength relative to fall impact forces, obesity was associated with decreased fracture hazard, consistent with a protective effect of soft tissue padding. Further adjustment for hip circumference, a surrogate marker of soft tissue padding, attenuated the obesity–fracture association. Our findings support that {{there are at least three}} major mechanisms by which obesity influences fracture risk: increased BMD in response to greater skeletal loading, increased impact forces, and greater absorption of impact forces by soft tissue padding. © 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research...|$|R

Properties such as powder porosity, hydration capacity, moisture sorption, particle size distribution, bulk density, tapped density, powder flow, pH of powder dispersion as well as differential scanning calorimetry thermal (DSC), X-ray diffraction (X-RD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were evaluated. The following results were obtained; pH {{was found to be}} 4 ± 0. 0, average true density, powder porosity and hydration capacity were; 1. 58 ± 0. 07 g/cm 3, 6. 76 ± 0. 42 %, and 150. 08 ± 76. 91 %, respectively. The average values of the moisture content and moisture sorption were; 11. 16 ± 016 % and 2 ± 0. 54 %, respectively. The average angle of repose for the palm kernel shell (PKS) was found to be 34. 09 ± 4. 77 o. The scanning electron microscopy showed that PKS powder had spherical shape. Based on EDX analysis PKS has a high carbon content of about 63 wt %. The XRD pattern for the PKS powder showed that the PKS powder was more of amorphous material with small amount of micro crystalline materials.
