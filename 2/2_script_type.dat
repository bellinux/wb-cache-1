Document images must be categorized according to their <b>script</b> <b>type</b> first, in our case Roman, Ideographic, or Arabic.

The document images are decomposed through the Wavelet Packet Decomposition using the Haar basis function up to level two. The texture features are extracted from the sub bands of the wavelet packet decomposition. The Shannon entropy value is computed for the set of sub bands and these entropy values are combined to obtain the texture features.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new script classification method for the discrimination of the South Slavic medieval labels. It consists in the textural {{analysis of the}} <b>script</b> <b>types.</b> In the first step, each letter is coded by the equivalent <b>script</b> <b>type,</b> which is defined by its typographical features. Obtained coded text is subjected to the run-length statistical analysis and to the adjacent local binary pattern analysis in order to extract the features. The result shows a diversity between the extracted features of the scripts, which makes the feature classification more effective. It {{is the basis for}} the classification process of the script identification by using an extension of a state-of-the-art approach for document clustering. The proposed method is evaluated on an example of hand-engraved in stone and hand-printed in paper labels in old Cyrillic, angular and round Glagolitic. Experiments demonstrate very positive results, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

40|$|Behavioral and neuroimaging {{studies have}} {{provided}} evidence that reading is strongly left lateralized, {{and the degree}} of this pattern of functional lateralization can be indicative of reading competence. However, it remains unclear whether functional lateralization differs between the first (L 1) and second (L 2) languages in bilingual L 2 readers. This question is particularly important when the particular script, or orthography, learned by the L 2 readers is markedly different from their L 1 script. In this study, we quantified functional lateralization in brain regions involved in visual word recognition for participants' L 1 and L <b>2</b> <b>scripts,</b> with a particular focus on the effects of L 1 -L <b>2</b> <b>script</b> differences in the visual complexity and orthographic depth of the script. Two different groups of late L 2 learners participated in an fMRI experiment using a visual one-back matching task: L 1 readers of Japanese who learnt to read alphabetic English and L 1 readers of English who learnt to read both Japanese syllabic Kana and logographic Kanji. The results showed weaker leftward lateralization in the posterior lateral occipital complex (pLOC) for logographic Kanji compared with syllabic and alphabetic scripts in both L 1 and L 2 readers of Kanji. When both L 1 and L <b>2</b> <b>scripts</b> were non-logographic, where symbols are mapped onto sounds, functional lateralization did not significantly differ between L 1 and L <b>2</b> <b>scripts</b> in any region, in any group. Our findings indicate that weaker leftward lateralization for logographic reading reflects greater requirement of the right hemisphere for processing visually complex logographic Kanji symbols, irrespective of whether Kanji is the readers' L 1 or L 2, rather than characterizing additional cognitive efforts of L 2 readers. Finally, brain-behavior analysis revealed that functional lateralization for L 2 visual word processing predicted L 2 reading competency. © 2014 Koyama, Stein, Stoodley and Hansen...|$|R
