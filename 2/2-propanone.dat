50|$|Due {{to the low}} entropy of mixing, {{miscibility}} gaps {{are often}} observed for polymer solutions. Many polymers are known that show UCST or LCST behavior in organic solvents. Examples for organic polymer solutions with UCST are polystyrene in cyclohexane, polyethylene in diphenylether or polymethylmethacrylate in acetonitrile. An LCST is observed for, e.g., polypropylene in n-hexane, polystyrene in butylacetate or polymethylmethacrylate in <b>2-propanone.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} systems with {{negative}} deviations that have vapor pressures that {{are lower than}} expected. Such a deviation is evidence for stronger intermolecular attraction between the constituents of the mixture than exists in the pure components. Thus, the molecules are [...] "held in" [...] the liquid more strongly when a second molecule is present. An example {{is a mixture of}} trichloromethane (chloroform) and <b>2-propanone</b> (acetone), which boils above the boiling point of either pure component.|$|E
5000|$|Scientific Instrument Services, Volatile Organic Emissions from Automobile Tires, 1999, Santford V. Overton & John J. Manura : Tire [...] "Brand A {{were found}} to contain {{numerous}} straight and branched chain hydrocarbons, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, furans and benzene derivatives." [...] Tire brand B was..."found to contain high concentrations of the compounds sulfur dioxide (DOT), 2-methyl-1-propene, <b>2-propanone,</b> 2-methyl-2-pentene, 2,4-pentanedione, acetic acid and 2,4-(1H, 3H) pyrimidinedione." [...] Chemicals extracted from raw tires in this study would be found in crumb rubber, which is made by grinding feedstock tires. The chemicals listed above include carcinogens, and other chemicals with dermal and endocrine disrupting impacts.|$|E
50|$|Briefly, 3-bromophenol was refluxed with bromoacetaldehyde and NaH to {{give the}} diethyl acetyl, which then was heated with polyphosphoric acid to give a mixture of bromobenzofurans {{structural}} isomers: 4-Bromo-1-benzofuran and 6-Bromo-1-benzofuran. Both isomers were separated via silica gel column chromatography, then catalytically converted to their respective <b>2-propanones,</b> and then reductively aminated to 6-APB and 4-APB. Both of which were converted to their HCl ion-pairs for further examination.|$|R
