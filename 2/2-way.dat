Lucic excelled during his season with the Kings, playing a strong <b>2-way</b> game while posting 20 goals, 35 assists for 55 points during the regular season. Lucic also added 3 assists in 5 games in the NHL Playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} <b>2-way</b> design {{consisted of}} two 150-4C bass drivers with 4-inch coils, and two H5038P-100 elliptical horns. The 5038s are essentially midrange drivers that start rolling off at 15kHz. In 1960, after feedback from foreign distributors, the Paragon {{was made into a}} 3-way loudspeaker by adding two 075 ring radiators (tweeters) mounted {{in the back of the}} cabinet and aimed at the central 'sweet spot'. Bass–mid crossover was at 500Hz and mid–treble frequencies crossed over at 7kHz.|$|E
5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to <b>2-way</b> you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E
5|$|Ranger's 9-foot {{prototype}} of the product, with plenty of right angles and shiny black Micarta skin, was bulky, imposing, and visually unattractive. Arnold Wolf was called in as the industrial design consultant to this project in early 1957. Wolf, who would later become {{president and chief executive}} of JBL, was initially asked to produce a shell version for dealers' shops. Due to transportation and installation constraints, it was decided that the speaker would be split into three components – the left and right channel enclosures, and the curved radiator panel – that could be easily re-assembled with a screwdriver. To support the weight and prevent deforming, the design called for six feet, of which four are height-adjustable. Instead of producing detailed drawings, Wolf worked with scale models. First, he created a 1:4 model in plastic, after which he made others. He ended with a 1:12 scale model that would show how it could be disassembled and reassembled. During the design phase, the relationship between Wolf and Ranger became very tense, and the project nearly collapsed. The parties came together over the month of June, and agreed on the definitive production specification for the Paragon. This would be a <b>2-way</b> design.|$|E

The pool using that vdev can now use the extra space and expand by 2TB. Any datasets or volumes in the pool can now use the extra space.|$|E
25|$|Separation of {{code and}} data caches lessens the fetch and operand read/write {{conflicts}} {{compared to the}} 486. To reduce access time and implementation cost, {{both of them are}} <b>2-way</b> associative, instead of the single 4-way cache of the 486. A related enhancement in the Pentium is the ability to read a contiguous block from the code cache even when it is split between two cache lines (at least 17 bytes in worst case).|$|E
25|$|In late 1948, {{a botched}} {{security}} detail {{led to the}} death of the semi-regular character Brilliant, the blind inventor of the <b>2-Way</b> Wrist Radio (among other devices) whereupon Chief Brandon, Dick Tracy's superior on the police force and a presence in the strip since 1931, resigned in shame and Pat Patton was promoted to police chief in Brandon's place, previously having been Tracy's buffoonish partner. A new character was introduced named Sam Catchem to take Patton's place as Tracy's sidekick.|$|E
25|$|Other {{changes to}} the core include a 6-stage {{pipeline}} (vs. 5 on P5) with a return stack (first done on Cyrix 6x86) and better parallelism, an improved instruction decoder, 32 KB L1 cache with 4-way associativity (vs. 16 KB with <b>2-way</b> on P5), 4 write buffers that could now be used by either pipeline (vs. one corresponding to each pipeline on P5) and an improved branch predictor taken from the Pentium Pro, with a 512 entry buffer (vs. 256 on P5).|$|E
25|$|In 1953 and 1954, Bel Airs {{could be}} ordered in convertible, hardtop coupe, two- and four-door sedans, and, for 1954, the Beauville station wagon which {{featured}} woodgrain trim {{around the side}} windows. Many new options, once available only to more expensive luxury cars, became offered starting in 1953, including power steering and the Guidematic headlight dimmer in 1953; and power brakes, power <b>2-way</b> front seat and power front windows in 1954. All 1954 models equipped with the standard transmission used the 1953 Powerglide engine.|$|E
25|$|The TLBs on the V60/70 are 16-entry fully {{associative}} with replacement done by microcode/firmware. The V80 {{in contrast}} has a 64-entry <b>2-way</b> set associative TLB with replacement done in hardware. TLB replacement took 58 cycles in the V70 and also disrupted the pipelined execution of other instructions. On the V80 a TLB replacement took only 6/11 cycles depending if the page {{was in the}} same area or not; pipeline disruption no longer occurred in V80 because of the separate TLB replacement hardware unit which operated in parallel {{to the rest of the}} processor.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Collins removed other Gould {{creations of}} the 1960s and 1970s (including Groovy Grove, who was gravely {{wounded in the}} line of duty and later died in the hospital; Lizz married him before his death). On a more {{philosophical}} level, Collins took a generally less cynical view of the justice system than Gould; Tracy came to accept its limitations and requirements as a normal part of the process which he could manage. Extreme technology was phased out, such as the Space Coupe, in favor of more realistic advanced tools such as the <b>2-Way</b> Wrist Computer in 1987.|$|E
25|$|In another study, 73 {{subjects}} were randomized to receive valaciclovir 1 g daily or placebo for 60 days each in a <b>2-way</b> crossover design. A daily swab of the genital area was self-collected for HSV-2 detection by polymerase chain reaction, {{in order to}} compare the effect of valaciclovir 1 g once daily for 60 days versus placebo on asymptomatic viral shedding in immunocompetent, HSV-2 seropositive subjects without a history of symptomatic genital herpes infection. The study found that valaciclovir significantly reduced shedding during subclinical days compared to placebo, showing a 71% reduction. 84% of subjects had no shedding while receiving valaciclovir versus 54% of subjects on placebo. 88% of patients treated with valaciclovir had no recognized signs or symptoms versus 77% for placebo.|$|E
25|$|The Athlon's CPU cache {{consisted}} of the typical two levels. Athlon was the first x86 processor with a 128kB split level 1 cache; a <b>2-way</b> associative cache separated into 2×64kB for data and instructions (a concept from Harvard architecture). This cache was double the size of K6's already large 2×32kB cache, and quadruple the size of Pentium II and III's 2×16kB L1 cache. The initial Athlon (Slot A, later called Athlon Classic) used 512kB of level 2 cache separate from the CPU, on the processor cartridge board, running at 50% to 33% of core speed. This was done because the 250nm manufacturing process was too large to allow for on-die cache while maintaining cost-effective die size. Later Athlon CPUs, afforded greater transistor budgets by smaller 180nm and 130nm process nodes, moved to on-die L2 cache at full CPU clock speed.|$|E

KEF released its CS1 constructor kit (1981) {{to tap the}} home-build market.

2500|$|On January 13, 1946, the <b>2-Way</b> Wrist Radio {{became one}} of the strip's most {{immediately}} recognizable icons, worn as a wristwatch by Tracy and members of the police force, and may have inspired later smartwatches. The <b>2-Way</b> Wrist Radio was upgraded to a <b>2-Way</b> Wrist TV in 1964. This development also led to the introduction of an important supporting character, Diet Smith, an eccentric industrialist who financed the development of this equipment. In a conspicuous coincidence, the idea of a radio built into a wrist watch {{played an important role in}} the story line of [...] "Superman – The Talking Cat" [...] broadcast on the Mutual Broadcasting System on January 9 through 28, 1946 (episodes 878 through 891).|$|E

[...] This optically superimposed the molecular model and the electron density map. [...] The model was moved to within the contour lines of the superimposed map. [...] Then, atomic coordinates were recorded using a plumb bob and a meter stick.|$|E
2500|$|While {{there is}} little {{evidence}} for dolphin language, experiments have shown that they can learn human sign language and can use whistles for <b>2-way</b> human-animal communication. Phoenix and Akeakamai, bottlenose dolphins, understood individual words and basic sentences like [...] "touch the frisbee with your tail and then jump over it" [...] (Herman, Richards, & Wolz 1984). Phoenix learned whistles, and Akeakamai learned sign language. Both dolphins understood the significance of the ordering of tasks in a sentence.|$|E
2500|$|A 1938 {{treatise}} by Chester Barnard, {{based on}} his own experience as a business executive, described the process as informal, intuitive, non-routinized and involving primarily oral, <b>2-way</b> communications.

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2003, Today once again found itself at the centre of {{allegations}} of political bias, this time against a Labour government. The controversy arose after Today broadcast a report by its correspondent Andrew Gilligan. The report alleged that a dossier the British Government had produced to convince the British public {{of the need to}} invade Iraq was deliberately exaggerated, and that the government had known this prior to publishing it. In his live <b>2-way</b> (interview with presenter John Humphrys), just after 6.07 a.m., Gilligan asserted that the Government [...] "probably knew" [...] that one of the main claims in its dossier [...] "was wrong". Gilligan's anonymous source for the claim was Dr David Kelly, a key adviser on biological weapons who had worked in Iraq – though it was never established whether Dr Kelly had actually used the words Gilligan attributed to him.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 Paradise Guitars {{worked with}} Becker {{to design a}} Jason Becker {{signature}} guitar. The design {{is based on the}} Peavey with colored number fret inlays. Features include an alder body, maple neck with steel <b>2-way</b> truss rod, maple 16" [...] radius fingerboard, 24 jumbo thin frets with colored number fret marker inlays, black Floyd Rose Pro Style floating Tremolo with Floyd Rose Tremolo stop, Sperzel red satin tuners, 14-degree tilt-back headstock with black Paradise logo and matching tremolo and electronics plates. The pickups are DiMarzio pickups; a PAF Pro-Custom in the neck colored yellow and red, a DP116 HS-2 in the middle colored green, and a Tone Zone-Custom in the bridge colored pink and blue. These colored pickups complement the colored inlays and seem to give the guitar a rainbow effect. There is also a red 5-way switch and purple 1–11 volume knob.|$|E
2500|$|AMD changed cache design {{significantly}} with the Thunderbird core. With the older Athlon CPUs, the CPU caching was of an inclusive design where {{data from the}} L1 is duplicated in the L2 cache. Thunderbird moved to an exclusive design where the L1 cache's contents are not duplicated in the L2. This increases total cache size of the processor and effectively makes caching behave {{as if there is}} a very large L1 cache with a slower region (the L2) and a very fast region (the L1). Because of Athlon's very large L1 cache and the exclusive design, which turns the L2 cache into basically a [...] "victim cache", the need for high L2 performance and size was lessened. AMD kept the 64-bit L2 cache data bus from the older Athlons, as a result, and allowed it to have a relatively high latency. A simpler L2 cache reduced the possibility of the L2 cache causing clock scaling and yield issues. Still, instead of the <b>2-way</b> associative scheme used in older Athlons, Thunderbird did move to a more efficient 16-way associative layout.|$|E

[...] The qualifying rounds included 3 areas: A, B, and C. [...] Area A was a test of the robots' ability to merge. [...] A <b>2-way</b> loop of human traffic (provided by professional stunt drivers) surrounded a one-way road running {{from one side of the}} loop to the other. [...] Robots had to go from the one-way road, make a left turn into traffic, follow the loop 180 degrees, and make another left turn onto the one-way road again. [...] Robots were free to make as many laps as they could in the allotted time. [...] Area B was mostly closed to spectators except for the start and finish, and involved the robots navigating a long suburban route demonstrating parking, navigation, and avoiding stalled cars along the way. Area B was part of the final event course. In Area C, robots performed several loops into two 4-way intersections in order to test their implementation of 4-way stops. [...] Each loop, human drivers would provide a progressively more difficult intersection situation. [...] At some points in Area C, roads would be blocked to test robots' ability to re-plan routes.|$|E
2500|$|DR's {{exist for}} the purpose of {{reducing}} network traffic by providing a source for routing updates. The DR maintains a complete topology table of the network and sends the updates to the other routers via multicast. All routers in a multi-access network segment will form a slave/master relationship with the DR. They will form adjacencies with the DR and BDR only. Every time a router sends an update, it sends it to the DR and BDR on the multicast address 224.0.0.6. The DR will then send the update out to all other routers in the area, to the multicast address 224.0.0.5. This way all the routers do not have to constantly update each other, and can rather get all their updates from a single source. [...] The use of multicasting further reduces the network load. [...] DRs and BDRs are always setup/elected on OSPF broadcast networks. [...] DR's can also be elected on NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multi-Access) networks such as Frame Relay or ATM. [...] DRs or BDRs are not elected on point-to-point links (such as a point-to-point WAN connection) because the two routers on either sides of the link must become fully adjacent and the bandwidth between them cannot be further optimized. DR and non-DR routers evolve from <b>2-way</b> to full adjacency relationships by exchanging DD, Request, and Update.|$|E
