50|$|Military {{operators}} would commonly {{operate the}} type {{at a very}} low altitude to minimise visibility to enemies, the Bo 105 being well matched to such operations, as the helicopter's flight qualities effectively removed or greatly minimised several of the hazards such a flight profile could pose to pilots.

The testwork was carried out on a typical Witbank coal, from the Kleinkopje Colliery, with an ash content of 23. 7 %. The coal was characterised by means of size, ash-by-size and float-and-sink analyses. Batch flotation experiments were carried out to provide a benchmark against which the ASH could be compared.

50|$|Modifications to the Sherman {{included}} the sealing {{of the lower}} hull, {{the addition of the}} propeller drive and the addition of Straussler's flotation screen around the hull, together with its inflation system. The base of the canvas flotation screen was attached to a horizontal mild steel boat-shaped platform welded to the tank's hull. The screen was supported by horizontal metal hoops and by 36 vertical rubber tubes. A system of compressed air bottles and pipes inflated the rubber tubes to give the curtain rigidity. The screen could be erected in 15 minutes and quickly collapsed once the tank reached the shore. In practice there was about 3 ft of freeboard. In combat, the flotation system was considered expendable and it was assumed the tank crew would remove and discard it as soon as conditions allowed. In practice, some units kept the <b>flotation</b> <b>equipment</b> and their tanks were used in several amphibious operations.|$|R

40|$|Flotation is an {{important}} part of coal preparation, and the flotation column is widely applied as efficient <b>flotation</b> <b>equipment.</b> This process is complex and affected by many factors, with the froth depth and reagent dosage being two of the most important and frequently manipulated variables. This paper proposes a new method of switching and optimizing control for the coal flotation process. A hybrid model is built and evaluated using industrial data. First, wavelet analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) are applied for signal pre-processing. Second, a control model for optimizing the set point of the froth depth is constructed based on fuzzy control, and a control model is designed to optimize the reagent dosages based on expert system. Finally, the least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM) is used to identify the operating conditions of the flotation process and to select one of the two models (froth depth or reagent dosage) for subsequent operation according to the condition parameters.

40|$|MODELLING OF LARGE-SIZE INDUSTRIAL <b>FLOTATION</b> <b>EQUIPMENT</b> The main {{objective}} of this project was the hydrodynamic and metallurgical characterization of large-size flotation cells. As industrial equipment, the work was focused mainly on rougher flotation cells of 130 m 3 located at the concentrating plant of the El Teniente Division, Codelco-Chile. The liquid and solid DTR was measured in three types of sizes (- 45, + 45 + 150, - 150 microns) in self-priming flotation cells of 130 m 3. The mean residence times observed in each cell ranged from 4. 5 to 6 minutes for different tonnages for operation of the plant. The DTR measurements were conducted through the radioactive tracer technique and allowed confirming that the operation of these equipments is different to the perfect mixing condition. In this regard, DTR for each individual cell was appropriately characterized through a LSTS (large and small tank-in-series) model. Moreover, the individual hydrodynamic behavior of all the cells in the bank was compared, detecting a high consistence in the operation with exceptions where short-circuits were observed. Complementarily, the transient modeling of the mixing process in industrial flotation cells was developed. In this regard, it was detected that the mixing time in a cell of 130 m 3 is about 60 - 80 seconds, comparable {{to the time of}} a pulp circulation in the rotor. Also, it was determined that pulp circulates about 5 times in the rotor before it abandons the cell. A new experimental technique was developed to determine DTR and the mean residence time of the liquid and solid through the large cell foam by using radioactive tracer and processing data through discrete deconvolution of time signals. A new metallurgical model with analytical solution for the collection zone of flotation columns was developed. A rectangular distribution for the kinetic constant and a LSTS (large and small tank-in-series) -type mixing model are considered in this model. A new technique was developed that allows identifying the kinetic constant for modeling an industrial flotation bank from a reduced experimental design, which consists in the solution of only two mass balances (first cell and global bank). Moreover, a methodology was developed that enables separating the scaling factor of <b>flotation</b> <b>equipments,</b> considering the independent kinetic component of hydrodynamics. A new system was developed for determining bubble load, a key element for measuring foam recovery in industrial cells. In this regard, the bubble load was measured in industrial flotation cells of 130 m 3 through capturing bubbles in a new prototype developed in the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria. This measuring together with the direct measuring of gas flow and mass balance allowed directly evaluating foam recovery in large industrial cells. A phenomenological model was developed to describe foam, of the CFD-type, which enabled describing the trajectory of liquid, air and solid flows, and also the composition spatial profiles (in two dimensions). The model was calibrated for the condition of real foam in the 130 m 3 industrial cell. The recovery of liquid and solid mineral by dragging in the foam, (in types of sizes) was determined. Results were appropriately compared to the determination of dragging by material balance, from the direct measuring of bubble load. This result enabled validating the assumption set out for calculating recovery of floatable mineral in foam. A methodology was developed for production and storage of Br- 82 radioactive gas, which allows studying transport and mixing of gases in industrial <b>flotation</b> <b>equipments.</b> The system was applied in the El Teniente mine for the characterization of the gas phase in 130 m 3 cells. The gas tracer enabled confirming that there is no gas dragging to the tails in large self-priming cells, and that inner gas recirculation is minimal. The mean gas concentration observed in the cell’s upper zone was of about 14 %. Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica - CONICY...|$|R
