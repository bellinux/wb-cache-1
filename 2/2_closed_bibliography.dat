40|$|Abstract. Tripod {{configurations}} of plane curves, formed by certain triples of normal lines co-inciding at a point, were introduced by Tabachnikov, who showed that C <b>2</b> <b>closed</b> convex curves possess {{at least two}} tripod configurations. Later, Kao and Wang established the existence of tripod configurations for C <b>2</b> <b>closed</b> locally convex curves. In this paper we generalize these two results, answering a conjecture of Tabachnikov {{on the existence of}} tripod configurations for all C <b>2</b> <b>closed</b> plane curves by proving existence for a generalized notion of tripod configuration. We then demon-strate the existence of the natural extensions of these tripod configurations to the spherical and hyperbolic geometries for a certain class of convex curves, and discuss an analogue of the problem for regular plane polygons. 1...|$|R

40|$|In data mining, {{the quality}} of an {{association}} rule can be stated by its support and its confidence. This paper investigates support and confidence measures for spatial and spatio-temporal data mining. Using fixed thresholds {{to determine how many}} times a rule that uses proximity is satisfied seems too limited. It allows the traditional definitions of support and confidence, but does not allow to make the support stronger if the situation is 2 ̆ <b>2</b> really <b>close</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2, as compared to 2 ̆ <b>2</b> fairly <b>close</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2. We investigate how to define and compute proximity measures for several types of geographic objects—point, linear, areal—and we express whether or not objects are <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> <b>close</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2 as a score in the range [0, 1]. We then use the theory from so-called fuzzy association rules to determine the support and confidence of an association rule.
