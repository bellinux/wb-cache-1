40|$|The diploma thesis Philological <b>Marginal</b> <b>Notes</b> in John's Gospel of Blahoslav's Translations of New Testament {{deals with}} the {{characteristics}} of the philological <b>marginal</b> <b>notes</b> in John's Gospel of Blahoslav's New Testament from the year 1564 and 1568. The life of Jan Blahoslav, the information about Blahoslav's New Testament and the history of the research about his translation of New Testament are summarised in the thesis as well as the tradition of Bible commentary and <b>marginal</b> <b>notes</b> in their European and Czech contexts. In the practical part the thesis presents the number of philological <b>marginal</b> <b>notes</b> explored in both editions, the number of variants in <b>marginal</b> <b>notes</b> and their word class distribution. It tries to find possible sources for the text in <b>marginal</b> <b>notes.</b> It uses Czech printed translations of the Bible (Klaudyán's New Testament, Lukáš's New Testament, Optát's New Testament, Melantrich's Bible of 1556 - 1557) and Latin translations by Erasmus and Beza and their annotations and Vulgate.

40|$|This work proposes an {{application}} {{of the concept of}} <b>Marginal</b> <b>Notes</b> to journalistic texts, and more specifically, their utilization for the characterization of Readers´ Comments in Cyberjournalism as an emerging form of Memory. The concept of <b>Marginal</b> <b>Notes</b> is discussed in its classical sense and then transposed to the situation of journalistic production. The idea of journalistic <b>Marginal</b> <b>Notes</b> is also associated with the topic of the War of the Memories, but what is basically distinguished is the value of the preservation of these comments as possible indicators of a Zeitgeist to be possibly recovered, from a specific historical distance. Some examples of <b>Marginal</b> <b>Notes</b> in journalism in online media are furnished. Attention is called to the need for understanding <b>Marginal</b> <b>Notes</b> as a “text”, in the broad sense of the word, since all the (multi) media formats incorporated as readers´ contributions {{should be included in the}} concept, and consequently efforts should be made for their preservation for future uses. </p...|$|R
