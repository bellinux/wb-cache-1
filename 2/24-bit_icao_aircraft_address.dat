5000|$|In November 2006, the ICAO issued new interim recommendations.

These {{compared with the}} 4 nmi km, 5 nmi km and 6 nmi km spacing applicable to other [...] "Heavy" [...] aircraft. Another A380 following an A380 should maintain a separation of 4 nmi km. On departure behind an A380, non-A380 [...] "Heavy" [...] aircraft are required to wait two minutes, and [...] "Medium"/"Light" [...] aircraft three minutes for time based operations. The ICAO also recommends that pilots append the term [...] "Super" [...] to the aircraft's callsign when initiating communication with air traffic control, to distinguish the A380 from [...] "Heavy" [...] aircraft.|$|R

40|$|Pollutant gases {{emitted from}} the civil jet are doing more and more harm to the {{environment}} with the rapid development of the global commercial aviation transport. Low environmental impact has become a new requirement for aircraft design. In this paper, estimation method for emission in aircraft conceptual design stage is improved based on the International Civil Aviation Organization (<b>ICAO)</b> <b>aircraft</b> engine emissions databank and the polynomial curve fitting methods. The greenhouse gas emission (CO 2 equivalent) per seat per kilometer is proposed to measure the emissions. An approximate sensitive analysis and a multi-objective optimization of aircraft design for tradeoff between greenhouse effect and direct operating cost (DOC) are performed with five geometry variables of wing configuration and two flight operational parameters. The results indicate that reducing the cruise altitude and Mach number may result in a decrease of the greenhouse effect but an increase of DOC. And the two flight operational parameters have more effects on the emissions than the wing configuration. The Pareto-optimal front shows that a decrease of 29. 8 % in DOC is attained at the expense of an increase of 10. 8 % in greenhouse gases...|$|R
50|$|The ICAO {{system for}} civil airport {{pavements}} involves comparison of an airport’s pavement classification number (PCN) with an aircraft classification number (ACN).

An aircraft having an ACN equal to or less than the PCN can operate without weight restrictions on a pavement. The PCN is formally published in an Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP).|$|R
