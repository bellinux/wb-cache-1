40|$|Objective: Intermittency is {{routinely}} {{used as a}} protective strategy against CNS and pulmonary hyperbaric oxygen (HBO 2) toxicity, however exact mechanisms of protection are not known. This {{study was designed to}} optimize intermittent HBO 2 exposures by variable duration of HBO <b>2</b> <b>cycles.</b> Methods: Rats were exposed to O 2 at 2. 8 ATA delivered either continuously for 6 h or intermittently with 10 min air breaks. Two intermittent paradigms were used; the first consisted of longer HBO <b>2</b> 60 min <b>cycles</b> at the beginning and shorter 30 min cycles at the end of exposure, while in the second paradigm, shorter cycles were followed by longer HBO <b>2</b> <b>cycles.</b> Effectiveness of intermittency was assessed by gene expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) in the lungs at the end of exposures. The gene expression was compared with changes in respiration detected by continuous recording of respiration by {{a modified version of the}} whole-body plethysmography. Results: All intermittent schedules inhibited lung inflammation compared with the continuous exposures. Efficacy of this inhibition was significantly better in intermittent groups starting with longer duration of HBO <b>2</b> <b>cycles</b> than in groups with reversed duration of HBO <b>2</b> <b>cycles.</b> Intermittent exposures starting with longer HBO <b>2</b> <b>cycles</b> also slowed down changes in respiratory frequency and tidal volume compared with the continuous exposure. HSP 70 was increased in all exposure groups. It was significantly higher in continuous exposures and in intermittent group starting with longer duration of HBO <b>2</b> <b>cycles</b> than in the group starting with shorter HBO <b>2</b> <b>cycles.</b> Conclusions: The higher benefit of the initially longer HBO <b>2</b> <b>cycles</b> could be in part explained by a higher oxidative stress and higher HSP 70 expression in lungs compared with exposures with initially shorter HBO <b>2</b> <b>cycles.</b> [J Exp Integr Med 2012; 2 (4) : 287 - 296...|$|R
40|$|Cogeneration, or {{combined}} {{heat and}} power (CHP), {{is the use}} of a heat engine or power station to simultaneously generate electricity and useful heat. Cogeneration is considered as a thermodynamically efficient use of fuel [1]. In separate productions of electricity, some energy must be discarded as waste heat, but in cogeneration this thermal energy is put to use. Usually the CHP plant uses steam as the working fluid and has a flexible ratio of cogeneration, which depends on the season. In turn, supercritical CO 2 (S-CO <b>2)</b> power <b>cycles</b> are proposed for future energy applications because of their high thermal efficiency [2]. However, the possibilities of carbon dioxide applications as working fluids for cogeneration power plants have never been published or expanded on. This paper considers several S-CO <b>2</b> <b>cycles</b> in terms of application in a CHP plant. Combined steam/S-CO <b>2</b> <b>cycles</b> are also proposed and described, though the S-CO <b>2</b> <b>cycles</b> are used as “bottom ” cycles which only turn on when heat production is not required.

Thus _ΔN_ 1 ^p(k) and _ΔN_ 2 ^p(k) at epoch (k) are in fact unknown. Considering that the GNSS carrier phase quality (except the potential integer cycle slip at epoch (k)) is consistent and stable within a short period of time, it is reasonable to assume that the polynomial fitting errors _ΔN_ 1 ^p(s) and _ΔN_ 2 ^p(s) (s=k-m,k-m+ 1,...k- 1) [...] at the past m epochs ahead of the epoch (k) have behavior similar to that at epoch (k).

40|$|Bottoming cycles {{are drawing}} a real {{interest}} {{in a world where}} resources are becoming scarcer and the environmental footprint of power plants is becoming more controlled. Reduction of flue gas temperature and power generation boost without burning more fuel are certainly very attractive, but how much can really be extracted from a Gas Turbine Unit (GTU) cycle to be converted to a com-bined configuration? The current study presents a continuation of our previous work in which supercritical CO 2 (S-CO <b>2)</b> bottoming <b>cycles</b> were con-sidered as an alternative to traditional steam cycles for purposes of waste heat recovery. Prior evaluation regarding the option of com-bined gas and S-CO <b>2</b> <b>cycles</b> for different gas turbine sizes, gas turbine exhaust gas temperatures and configurations of bottoming cycle type allowed making conclusions about the advisability of the mentioned heat utilization technology and selecting the best em-bodiment of bottoming cycle taking into account heat source fea-tures.

The oil pan has a common problem of being crushed or bent during maintenance and can decrease the oil pickup tube flow causing main bearing failures as well. Modified Renesis engines can experience side seal failures due to a combination of exhaust back pressure and higher exhaust temperature. Overheating and heat expansion of housings can cause seals in the rotary engine to fail as well.

In the genome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803, {{we have identified}} open reading frames encoding enzymes homologous to those forming the plant-like C <b>2</b> <b>cycle</b> and the bacterial-type glycerate pathway. To study the route and importance of 2 -phosphoglycolate metabolism, the identified genes were systematically inactivated by mutagenesis. With a few exceptions, most of these genes could be inactivated without leading to a high-CO 2 -requiring phenotype. Biochemical characterization of recombinant proteins verified that Synechocystis harbors an active serine hydroxymethyltransferase, and, contrary to higher plants, expresses a glycolate dehydrogenase instead of an oxidase to convert glycolate to glyoxylate. The mutation of this enzymatic step, located prior to the branching of phosphoglycolate metabolism into the plant-like C <b>2</b> <b>cycle</b> and the bacterial-like glycerate pathway, resulted in glycolate accumulation and a growth depression already at high CO 2. Similar growth inhibitions were found for a single mutant in the plant-type C <b>2</b> <b>cycle</b> and more pronounced for a double mutant affected in both the C <b>2</b> <b>cycle</b> and the glycerate pathway after cultivation at low CO 2.

When exposed to low CO 2, glycine decarboxylase knockout mutants accumulated far more glycine and lysine than wild-type cells or mutants with inactivated glycerate pathway.
