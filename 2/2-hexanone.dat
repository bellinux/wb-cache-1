5000|$|... <b>2-Hexanone</b> (methyl butyl ketone, MBK) is a ketone used as {{a general}} solvent and in paints. It dissolves {{cellulose}} nitrate, vinyl polymers and copolymers, and natural and synthetic resins. It is recommended as a solvent because it is photochemically inactive; however {{it has a very}} low safe threshold limit value. <b>2-Hexanone</b> is absorbed through the lungs, orally and dermally and its metabolite, 2,5-hexanedione, is neurotoxic. Animal tests have shown that the neurotoxic effect of <b>2-hexanone</b> may be potentiated by simultaneous administration of 2-butanone (methyl ethyl ketone, MEK).|$|E

5000|$|... 3-Methyl-2-pentanone (methyl sec-butyl ketone) is an {{aliphatic}} ketone and isomer of <b>2-hexanone.</b> It {{is used as}} a solvent and as an intermediate for syntheses. Its industrial importance is low. It is produced by base-catalyzed aldol condensation of 2-butanone with acetaldehyde, forming 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-pentanone, which is dehydrated to 3-methyl-3-penten-2-one over an acid catalyst, followed by hydrogenation over a palladium catalyst.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in the 1960s and 70's, {{the high}} {{incidence}} rate of polyneuropathy amongst industrial workers chronically exposed to petroleum benzine and other hydrocarbon solvents prompted {{investigations into the}} safety of chronic exposure to petroleum distillates. Many of the cases of polyneuropathy amongst workers chronically exposed to vapors of petroleum benzine and similar solvents {{have been attributed to}} the n-hexane component of these mixtures. Using an animal model (Wistar-strain male rats), Ono and coworkers reported that chronic exposure (12 h a day for 24 weeks) to hydrocarbon solvent vapors conspicuously impaired peripheral nerve function in the 500 ppm n-hexane group, slightly impaired in the 200 ppm n-hexane group and petroleum benzine II group (containing 500 ppm n-hexane), and barely impaired in the petroleum benzine I group (containing 200 ppm n-hexane). These results suggest that some components in petroleum benzine are likely to antagonize the neurotoxic effects of n-hexane to the peripheral nerves, possibly by inhibiting the oxidation of n-hexane to its more toxic metabolites <b>2-hexanone</b> and 2,5-hexanedione. Ono and coworkers also observed depressed body weight gains amongst the exposed groups compared to the control group in the order: petroleum benzine II > petroleum benzine I (ccontaining 200 ppm n-hexane) >> 500 ppm n-hexane > 200 ppm n-hexane. These results suggest that other components found in petroleum benzine may have an additive, syngeristic or potentiative effects on the biological effects of n-hexane. Namely, 1000 ppm n-hexane, 3000 ppm n-heptane and 1000 ppm toluene were reported to have the effect of depressing the body weight gain of rats.|$|E
