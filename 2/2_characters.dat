25|$|The Sims <b>2</b> <b>characters</b> {{pass through}} seven life stages — babies, toddlers, children, teenagers, young adults (only with University), adults, and elders — with {{eventual}} death of old age, while babies in The Sims only become children before ceasing to continue aging. The aspiration system (described above) is also new to The Sims 2. Sims can become pregnant and produce babies that take on genetic characteristics of their parents, such as eye color, hair color, facial structure, and personality traits {{as opposed to}} Sims, in which the baby would take on random appearance and personality. Genetics {{play a major role}} in the game, and as such, dominant and recessive genes play a larger role than they did in the original game. A player can also aspire to have a Sim abducted by aliens. Males then have the chance to become impregnated and produce after three Sim days a half-alien child.|$|E

500|$|The Digital Devil Saga games use a turn-based battle system, {{with three}} allied {{characters}} fighting in battle. Both player characters and enemies {{are governed by}} a mechanic called the Press Turn system: each character has a symbol representing a turn. The character can forfeit a turn to allow the next character an action; turns cannot be passed more than once. If an enemy's weakness is exploited or a character lands a critical hit, an extra turn is gained; if a character resists an attack, a turn is lost. In Digital Devil Saga <b>2,</b> <b>characters</b> will sometimes enter battle in a half-transformed [...] "berserk" [...] mode, which increases attack power while locking away magic skills and lowering a character's defense. While battle is focused around strengthening characters' demon forms, they can also fight in their human forms using conventional weapons, and can equip ammunition. A human character can perform a combo with one in demon form. The magic system uses nine magic attributes. Ice and Lightning magic {{have a chance of}} causing the [...] "freeze" [...] and [...] "stun" [...] status, while Expel magic reduces an enemy's hit points by a certain percentage, and Death magic causes an instant kill. Status magic can inflict status effects on enemies.|$|E
500|$|Marvel vs. Capcom has {{featured}} over 100 playable fighters, primarily {{drawn from}} comic book series published by Marvel Comics {{and video games}} franchises developed and produced by Capcom. Rarely, the games have introduced original characters, which include Norimaro from Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, and Amingo, Ruby Heart, and SonSon from Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes. In addition to the playable cast, other characters from the Marvel and Capcom universes make appearances in the games in varying capacities. Both Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter and Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes include secret characters which can be played by inputting specific sequences of joystick movements on the character select screen. These secret characters consist of palette swaps of existing fighters with different moveset properties. Clash of Super Heroes also has unplayable summon characters {{as part of its}} [...] "Guest Character/Special Partner" [...] assist system. Many Marvel vs. Capcom installments also allow players to fight as the games' boss characters in special game modes, with the exception of Abyss from Marvel vs. Capcom <b>2.</b> <b>Characters</b> that have not been playable frequently make cameo appearances in the games' cutscenes and stage backgrounds. Lastly, numerous non-playable Marvel and Capcom characters are featured as [...] "Ability Cards" [...] in the Heroes and Heralds game mode in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Out of all the playable characters, Ryu and Chun-Li are the only ones to have appeared in every game released thus far.|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of Dota 2 led Valve to produce apparel, accessories, posters, {{and a number}} of other products featuring the heroes and other elements from the game. In addition, Valve secured licensing contracts with third-party producers; the first of these deals concerned a Dota 2 themed SteelSeries mousepad, which was announced at Gamescom 2011. In September 2012, Weta Workshop, the prop studio that creates the [...] "Aegis of Champions" [...] trophy for winners of The International, announced a product line that would include statues, weapons, and armor based on Dota <b>2</b> <b>characters</b> and items. In February 2013, the National Entertainment Collectibles Association announced a new toy line featuring hero-themed action figures at the American International Toy Fair. At Gamescom 2015, an HTC Vive virtual reality (VR) tech demo based around the shopkeeper of the game's item shop was showcased, allowing participants to interact with various items and objects from the game in VR. The demo, known as Secret Shop, was later included on The Lab, Valve's virtual reality compilation game, the following year. After the conclusion of The International 2015, Valve awarded the Collector's Aegis of Champions, which was a 1/5th scale brass replica of the Aegis of Champions trophy, to those with compendiums of 1,000 levels or more. Valve awarded the Collector's Aegis again the following year for The International 2016, as well as selling a limited edition Dota 2 themed HTC Vive virtual reality headset during the event. In July 2017, an 18-track official soundtrack was released by Ipecac Recordings, including a version on vinyl. A collectible card game based on elements from Dota 2, titled Artifact, will be released in 2018.|$|E
