40|$|Abstract — Mapping opaque and {{confined}} environments such as {{caves and}} pipes is a challenging problem for mobile robots because sensor information is severely {{limited to the}} immediate proximity of the robot due to the extreme environmental conditions. The robot must also be flexible and agile in unstructured environments while still providing accurate pose estimation. This paper presents a solution to mapping a 2 -dimensional tube by using only a snake robot’s proprioceptive joint angle sensors. We assume that the tube is sufficiently smooth and that we know the tube width. We propose techniques for (1) pose estimation of a snake robot by using a self-posture motion model, (<b>2)</b> <b>correcting</b> error in pose estimation using only the snake’s internal configuration over time, and (3) building environmental features using only self-occupancy and contact detection. Our goal {{is to use the}} minimal amount of sensor information possible to build an accurate spatial map of the environment. We have tested the proposed techniques in simulated environments and experimental results show that they are both effective and efficient for mapping tube environments. We plan to extend these techniques to deal with more complex confined environments beyond single-path tubes. I...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{observations}} from satellite gravimetry (the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission) suggest an acceleration of ice mass loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS). The contribution of surface mass balance changes (due to variable precipitation) is compared with GRACE-derived mass loss acceleration by assessing the estimated contribution of snow mass from meteorological reanalysis data. We find that {{over much of}} the continent, the acceleration can be explained by precipitation anomalies. However, on the Antarctic Peninsula and other parts of West Antarctica, mass changes are not explained by precipitation and are likely associated with ice discharge rate increases. The total apparent GRACE acceleration over all of the AIS between 2003 and 2013 is − 13. 6 [*]±[*] 7. 2 [*]Gt/yr^ 2. Of this total, we find that the surface mass balance component is − 8. 2 [*]±[*] 2. 0 [*]Gt/yr^ 2. However, the GRACE estimate appears to contain errors arising from the atmospheric pressure fields used to remove air mass effects. The estimated acceleration error from this effect is about 9. 8 [*]±[*] 5. 8 [*]Gt/yr^ <b>2.</b> <b>Correcting</b> for this yields an ice discharge acceleration of − 15. 1 [*]±[*] 6. 5 [*]Gt/yr^ 2...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{improved}} {{method for}} correction of partial volume effects (PVE) in brain SPECT is proposed. It is fully three-dimensional, {{does not require}} particular patient positioning, and works with scans only partially covering the brain. The location of functionally inactive brain regions (primarily cerebrospinal fluid) is extracted from high-resolution MRI. An automatic 3 D registration algorithm then determines the geometric transformation between MRI and SPECT. Correction consists of: 1) counting the volumetric active/inactive ratio in each volume element of the functional scan using the measured SPECT point spread function; <b>2)</b> <b>correcting</b> the functional measures according to these ratios; 3) fusing functional and anatomical information at the resolution of MRI. Quantitative validation was performed using a phantom containing a test region in which multiple parallel acrylic plates thinner than SPECT resolution created high PVE, {{as well as a}} large reference region not suffering from PVE. Reference activity was recovered in the test region with an accuracy of 1 – 3 %. The method was applied to clinical images demonstrating a combination of hypoperfusion and cortical atrophy.

The phenomenon is usually referred to as dynamical friction. The velocity, v, of the test mass decays on a timescale independent of v in the non-relativistic case. We derive expressions for dynamical friction in {{the case that the}} test mass and the light particles are relativistic, and that the scattering is weak (with impact parameter, b M). In the case that the light particles are ultra-relativistic, and isotropic in the frame in which M moves with velocity v, we nd an explicit expression for the dynamical friction.

Using a double tag technique we obtain branching fractions for three D^ 0 and six D^+ modes, including the reference branching fractions B (D^ 0 → K^-π^+) =(3. 934 ± 0. 021 ± 0. 061) % and B (D^+ → K^- π^+π^+) =(9. 224 ± 0. 059 ± 0. 157) %. The uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. In these measurements we include the effects of final-state radiation by allowing for additional unobserved photons in the final state, and the systematic errors include our estimates of the uncertainties of these effects. Furthermore, using an independent measurement of the luminosity, we obtain the cross sections σ(e^+e^-→ D^ 0 D^ 0) =(3. 607 ± 0. 017 ± 0. 056) nb and σ(e^+e^-→ D^+D^-) =(2. 882 ± 0. 018 ± 0. 042) nb at a center of mass energy, E_cm = 3774 ± 1 MeV.
