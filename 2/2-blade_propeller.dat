2500|$|The Admiralty ordered 18 LCAs from Messrs. Thornycroft in April 1939. These early boats weighed {{more than}} 9 tons and had flush-decked hulls, an {{armoured}} bulkhead forward that {{wrapped around the}} steering compartment on the starboard side. The steering compartment's armour plates stood about two feet proud of the deck line. In September, 8 more were ordered. Ford V8 marine conversions by Thornycroft powered the early groups of LCAs, these water-cooled petrol engines developing 65 hp each when driving the 19"x14" [...] <b>2-bladed</b> <b>propellers</b> through a 41:20 gear reduction.

5000|$|The SIM-VIII was a parasol winged {{monoplane}} {{powered by}} a [...] Siemens-Halske Sh 14 engine driving a wooden <b>2-bladed</b> <b>propeller,</b> seating two crew members in tandem open cockpits. Construction of the SIM-VIII employs several new construction solutions designed to reduce cost and streamline production, without compromising aircraft flight characteristics, built mostly of wooden construction with steel fittings at high stress areas. The fuselage is entirely made of wood covered with plywood, and the wings have supporting structure made of wood covered with fabric. On each side, the wings are supported {{by a pair of}} inclined struts attached to the lower fuselage longerons, and the fuel tank is also located in the centre fuselage. The control surfaces are made of welded steel tube, covered with fabric and the fixed V-strutted landing gear was built up from high strength steel tube enabling the SIM-VIII to handle rough landing strips.|$|R
5000|$|The engine has a 2.7:1 Propeller Speed Reduction Unit (PSRU) with {{helical gears}} in an oil bath. Final {{drive to the}} wooden 63 in {{diameter}} <b>2-blade</b> Hoffman <b>propeller</b> was via a rubber “doughnut” coupling. The PSRU design sited the axis of the propeller below that of the crankshaft. This feature allowed a more pointed nose on the ARV, {{at the cost of}} slightly reduced propeller clearance.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{pilot boat}} is {{required}} to be on station during all weather and, {{in the case of}} the San Francisco Bar Pilots of the time, remain on station for about five days supporting a crew of seven hosting up to ten pilots, modification was required. The Association had the vessel modified by The Moore Dry Dock Company of Oakland, after consultation with the original designer, increased power with a [...] Atlas-Imperial diesel engine to replace the original Atlas [...] diesel engine that in turn required modifications to the stern to accommodate a larger shaft and 65 in diameter propeller with 59 in pitch replacing the original 54 in diameter, <b>2-bladed</b> <b>propeller.</b> The propulsion change increased speed from approximately 7.5 to 9.73 kn knots. Deck houses and accommodations were renovated to fit the needs of pilots serving long waits on station with a pilot house added that was unusual for a yacht and resembling that of a commercial vessel. The galley had an Ingle oil burner range and accommodations were heated by a steam heat system based on an Areola boiler. Modifications resulted in an increase in draft from the original designed 13 ft to 14 ft with a new waterline length of 103 ft and displacement increasing from 210 to 245 tons.|$|R
5000|$|The Airscrew Company was {{established}} in Weybridge, Surrey, England in 1923 when John Dodds Titler bought the assets of Lang, Garnett and Company, otherwise known as the Lang Propeller Company of Riverside Works, Weybridge. Lang Propellers was based at Hamm Moor Lane and at its peak supplied wooden propellers to nearly every aeroplane company in England. Alcock and Brown flew the Atlantic in a Vickers Vimy fitted with Lang propellers; a letter held at Chertsey Museum confirms this and one of these four-bladed propellers survives at Brooklands Museum. The Lang company was absorbed into another aeronautical enterprise and vacated its works in Surrey. The company manufactured <b>2-blade</b> wooden <b>propellers</b> for the early Spitfires and Hurricanes ...|$|R

Later craft used propellers with three blades.The Admiralty placed orders for 30 LCAs in March 1940. By this time, Thornycroft were subcontracting with South Coast yacht-builders to fill the Admiralty's many small boat orders as Thornycroft yards were overtaxed building war-emergency convoy escorts and the like. Some LCAs - Numbers 24-29 and 51 - were fitted with Parsons conversions of the Ford V8, driving propellers similar to the standard type but on a 2:1 gear reduction; these LCAs did 12 kn at 3,300 revolutions. The standard engine fitted in almost all other craft was the Scripps conversion of the Ford V8. Official trial results for craft built in 1940-1 with this engine show a consistent performance with an unladen speed of 11 kn at 2,800 revolutions. June saw 64 more LCA orders, and then between late September and March 1941 another 104. These early craft {{did not yet have}} the later standard portside armoured Lewis gun position, but nevertheless, had framed canvas hold covers, scaling ladders mounted on the decks amidships, and various other refinements dropped when mass production got into full swing. The finish and performance of these early LCAs were quite fine, which might be expected as these boats were built in established Thornycroft selected yards, but in circumstances of nightly blackouts, air raids, wartime restrictions, and shortages the LCA building programme was a remarkable achievement.|$|R
2500|$|In 1913, the schoolboy Reginald F. Mann, a {{successful}} designer and builder of model aircraft, {{set up the}} company [...] "Mann & Grimmer" [...] at Surbiton, London with his teacher Robert T. Grimmer to build model aircraft on a commercial scale. The outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 resulted in Mann starting {{the design of a}} two-seat machine gun-armed aircraft. Mann wanted his design to combine a good field of fire for the observer's machine gun, as found in pusher configuration aircraft, with the higher performance found in tractor aircraft. To meet these requirements, his design featured a deep conventional fuselage, powered by a single engine mounted in the nose, which drove two <b>2-bladed</b> pusher <b>propellers</b> that were mounted behind and between the wings, via a long shaft to a gearbox and chain drives to the propellers. The observer sat in the nose of the aircraft, just behind the engine, while the pilot sat in a separate cockpit behind the trailing edge of the wings. It had two-bay wings with a swept leading edge and ailerons on upper and lower wings. It had a fixed conventional landing gear.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} is of all-metal construction, with cantilever mid-wings with detachable tips. The {{leading edges}} are swept-back, and the stressed-skin wings have flaps inboard of the ailerons. The fuselage is a monocoque structure, with a hinged nose to allow loading of a stretcher or other awkward loads. Seating {{can be arranged}} for one pilot and five passengers, or two pilots and three passengers. There is a door {{on both sides of}} the cabin, and there is a baggage compartment behind the rear seats. The tailplane has twin fins at the ends of the dihedral stabiliser. The elevators and rudders are fabric-covered. The tricycle landing gear is hydraulically retractable. The two engines are mounted towards the rear of the wing, driving <b>2-bladed</b> fixed-pitch pusher <b>propellers.</b> Originally planned to use Blackburn Cirrus Major III engines, it was fitted with Walter Minor 6-III engines.|$|R
