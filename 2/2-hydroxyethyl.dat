This used a <b>2-hydroxyethyl</b> {{methacrylate}} hydrogel as a scaffold onto which two dyes were attached one a fluorescent anionic dye and a cationic quencher (to be specific, a viologen) functionalized with boronic acid, which assumes a negative charge when bound to glucose, making the net charge of the molecule neutral and less attracted to the fluorophore, hence modulating its intensity based on glucose concentration.|$|E
50|$|The main use {{of sodium}} <b>2-hydroxyethyl</b> {{sulfonate}} is {{the production of}} the isethionate class of surfactants. These are readily foaming and particularly mild, making them suitable for cleaning sensitive skin and are therefore mainly used in baby soaps and shampoos. Because of its pronounced skin compatibility sodium <b>2-hydroxyethyl</b> sulfonate is added to soaps and liquid skin cleansers with up to 15 parts by weight.|$|E
50|$|From sodium <b>2-hydroxyethyl</b> {{sulfonate}} {{the so-called}} biological buffers such as HEPES, MES, PIPES etc. are easily accessible.|$|E

50|$|The {{addition}} of <b>2-hydroxyethyl</b> sulfonate to electroplating baths allows higher current densities and lower concentrations than {{the much more}} expensive methane sulphonic acid with improved appearance.|$|E
50|$|Petiveria alliacea {{has been}} found to contain a large number of biologically active {{chemicals}} including benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, benzyl <b>2-hydroxyethyl</b> trisulphide, coumarin, isoarborinol, isoarborinol acetate, isoarborinol cinnamate, isothiocyanates, polyphenols, senfol, tannins, and trithiolaniacine.|$|E

50|$|The {{specific}} toxin {{responsible for}} the rash {{was determined to be}} the sulfur-bearing salt (<b>2-hydroxyethyl)</b> dimethylsulfoxonium chloride. This salt is also found in some sea sponges and has potent cytotoxic activity against P388 leukemia cells.|$|E
5000|$|... 2-Hydroxyethylation (attachment of -CH2-CH2-OH) by {{ethylene}} carbonate of carboxylic acids and certain heterocycles bearing an acidic N-H. For example, benzoic acid {{is converted to}} the ester, <b>2-hydroxyethyl</b> benzoate, by treatment with {{ethylene carbonate}} {{in the presence of}} tetraethylammonium iodide.|$|E
50|$|Solid sodium <b>2-hydroxyethyl</b> {{sulfonate}} is a colorless, free-flowing, non-hygroscopic solid, which dissolves readily {{in water}} and has good biodegradability. Due to the method of synthesis samples often contain traces of sodium sulfite or sodium hydrogen sulfite causing aqueous solution to possesses a mildly alkaline pH of about 10.|$|E
50|$|Poly (<b>2-hydroxyethyl</b> methacrylate) (PHEMA) hydrogels can be {{combined}} with rosette nanotubes (RNTs). RNTs can emulate skin structures such as collagen and keratin and self-assemble when injected into the body. This type of hydrogel is being explored for use in skin regeneration and has shown promising results such as fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation. Both of these cell types are crucial {{for the production of}} skin components.|$|E
5000|$|Sodium <b>2-hydroxyethyl</b> {{sulfonate}} (also: sodium isethionate) is {{the sodium}} salt of 2-hydroxyethane sulfonic acid (isethionic acid), it is used as hydrophilic head group in washing-active surfactants, known as isethionates (acyloxyethanesulfonates) due to its strong polarity and resistance to multivalent ions. It is being studied as high production volume chemical in the [...] "High Production Volume (HPV) Chemical Challenge Program" [...] of the US Environmental Protection Ministry EPA.|$|E
50|$|Structural {{studies showed}} that in the soluble form, CLIC {{proteins}} adopt a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fold with an active site exhibiting a conserved glutaredoxin monothiol motif, similar to the omega class GSTs. Al Khamici et al. demonstrated that CLIC proteins have glutaredoxin-like glutathione-dependent oxidoreductase enzymatic activity. CLICs 1, 2 and 4 demonstrate typical glutaredoxin-like activity using <b>2-hydroxyethyl</b> disulfide as a substrate. This activity may regulate CLIC ion channel function.|$|E
50|$|To avoid {{contamination}} and suppress {{the formation of}} by-products (which are difficult to remove) the reaction must be performed under careful control of mass ratios and process conditions. Excess sulfite (SO32−) or bisulfite (HSO3−) lead to an unpleasant odor of the downstream product, higher levels of ethylene glycol or glycol ethers (formed by the hydrolysis and ethoxylation of ethylene oxide) give hygroscopic and greasy surfactants. Concentrated ethylene glycol-containing sodium <b>2-hydroxyethyl</b> sulfonate solutions can subsequently mostly be freed from ethylene glycol by continuous extraction with e.g. isopropanol (<0.5%). Therefore, in the continuous industrial process an aqueous sodium hydrogen sulfite solution is prepared in a first reactor by mixing a sodium hydroxide solution and sulfur dioxide. In a second reactor the sodium hydrogen sulfite solution is mixed with a slight excess of ethylene oxide to obtain sodium <b>2-hydroxyethyl</b> sulfonate in almost quantitative yields at elevated temperature and pressure with a precise control of pH. The reaction has to take place under the exclusion of oxygen and under precise control of the stoichiometry of the reactants, the temperature, the pH and the throughput.|$|E

50|$|Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) is a polymer {{that forms}} a {{hydrogel}} in water.Poly (hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) hydrogel for intraocular lens (IOL) materials was synthesized by solution polymerization using <b>2-hydroxyethyl</b> methacrylate (HEMA) as raw material, ammonium persulfate and sodium pyrosulfite (APS/SMBS) as catalyst, and triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) as cross-linking additive. It {{was invented by}} Drahoslav Lim and Otto Wichterle for biological use. Together they succeeded in preparing a cross-linking gel which absorbed up to 40% of water, exhibited suitable mechanical properties and was transparent. They patented this material in 1953.|$|E
50|$|Ethyl {{acrylate}} is a reactant for homologous alkyl acrylates (acrylic esters) by transesterification {{with higher}} alcohols through acidic or basic catalysis. In that way speciality acrylates are made accessible, e.g. 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (from 2-ethylhexanol) used for pressure-sensitive adhesives, cyclohexyl acrylate (from cyclohexanol) used for automotive clear lacquers, <b>2-hydroxyethyl</b> acrylate (from ethylene glycol) which is crosslinkable with diisocyanates to form gels used with long-chain acrylates (from C18+ alcohols) as comonomer for comb polymers for {{reduction of the}} solidification point of paraffin oils and 2-dimethylaminoethyl acrylate (from dimethylaminoethanol) for the preparation of flocculants for sewage clarification and paper production.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common causes of corneal neovascularization is iastrogenic {{pathology}} from contact lens wear. This is especially true of lenses made with older hydrogel materials such as HEMA (<b>2-hydroxyethyl</b> methacrylate) for both daily and extended wear. Such older hydrogel materials have a relatively low oxygen transmissibility so the cornea becomes starved of oxygen leading to the ingress of blood capillaries into the clear cornea to satisfy that oxygen demand. Older estimates have 128,000 to 470,000 cases of lens-induced CNV each year, but this may be decreasing due to the increasing popularity of daily disposable lenses.|$|E
