5000|$|Many bottles {{were still}} being mouth-blown and their lips formed by {{assorted}} tooling devices as late as 1915-20. The patent for the first fully automatic <b>bottle</b> <b>machine,</b> the Owens Automatic <b>Bottle</b> <b>Machine,</b> was not issued until 1903. And by 1906 it was swiftly replacing the old method at glasshouses nationwide. [...] Early examples of <b>machine</b> made <b>bottles</b> manufactured between about 1906 and 1915 often resemble their predecessors in shape and color and can be nominally valuable for that reason.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Recently, {{the need}} to {{accelerate}} the operating cycle of <b>bottling</b> <b>machines</b> while maintaining low operation cost has arisen. However, conveying bottles at high speed without spilling the liquids inside requires advanced techniques for vibration suppression control. In this paper, we optimize the motion curve for an intermittent conveyance <b>bottling</b> <b>machine</b> by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to decrease residual vibration at {{the surface of the}} liquid. Additionally, we propose a method for assigning magnitude relations to variables and defining the curve by using variable transformations. I...|$|R

50|$|A full-line vending {{company may}} set up {{several types of}} vending {{machines}} that sell {{a wide range of}} products. Products may include candy, cookies, chips, fresh fruit, milk, cold food, coffee and other hot drinks, bottles, cans of soda, and even frozen products like ice cream. These products can be sold from machines that include hot coffee, snack, cold food, 20-oz. <b>bottle</b> <b>machines,</b> and glass-front <b>bottle</b> <b>machines.</b> In the United States, almost all machines accept bills with more and more machines accepting $5 bills. This is an advantage to the vendor because it virtually eliminates the need for a bill changer. Larger corporations with cafeterias will often request full line vending with food service.|$|R
50|$|Henes {{patented}} the Henes-Keller <b>bottling</b> <b>machine</b> in 1897, and {{it became}} the leading <b>bottling</b> <b>machine</b> in the beer industry after it was introduced in 1903. The device transferred beer from barrels to bottles without loss of carbonation, and it featured a revolving filler and air pump. Henes {{served as president of}} the Henes & Keller Company, which manufactured the bottle-filling machines, and the equipment was marketed globally. An improvement of the machine was later patented by his son, John E. Henes (1881-1948), who managed the company after his father's death. The plant, which stood at 14th Avenue and 6th Street in Menominee, was sold to the L. E. Jones company in the early 1940s.|$|R
