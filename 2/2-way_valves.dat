50|$|Although many <b>2-way</b> <b>valves</b> {{are made}} in which the flow can go in either {{direction}} between the two ports, when a valve is placed into a certain application, flow is often expected to go from one certain port on the upstream side of the valve, to the other port on the downstream side. Pressure regulators are variations of valves in which flow is controlled to produce a certain downstream pressure, if possible. They are often used to control flow of gas from a gas cylinder. A back-pressure regulator is a variation of a valve in which flow is controlled to maintain a certain upstream pressure, if possible.|$|E
50|$|In {{plants with}} {{remote-controlled}} process operation, {{such as oil}} refineries and petrochemical plants, some <b>2-way</b> <b>valves</b> can be designated as normally closed (NC) or normally open (NO) during regular operation. Examples of normally-closed valves are sampling valves, which are only opened while a sample is taken. Other examples of normally-closed valves are emergency shut-down valves, which are kept open when the system is in operation and will automatically shut by taking away the power supply. This happens {{when there is a}} problem with a unit or a section of a fluid system such as a leak in order to isolate the problem from the rest of the system. Examples of normally-open valves are purge-gas supply valves or emergency-relief valves. When there is a problem these valves open (by switching them 'off') causing the unit to be flushed and emptied.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} valve design variations. Ordinary valves can have many ports and fluid paths. A <b>2-way</b> <b>valve,</b> for example, has 2 ports; if the valve is open, {{then the two}} ports are {{connected}} and fluid may flow between the ports; if the valve is closed, then ports are isolated. If the valve is open when the solenoid is not energized, then the valve is termed normally open (N.O.). Similarly, if the valve is closed when the solenoid is not energized, then the valve is termed normally closed. [...] There are also 3-way and more complicated designs. [...] A 3-way valve has 3 ports; it connects one port to {{either of the two}} other ports (typically a supply port and an exhaust port).|$|R
5000|$|The Guises Creek Rural Fire Brigade {{is located}} on the corner of Old Cooma Road and the Monaro Highway, near Royalla, New South Wales. Its history goes back to the Williamsdale Bush Fire Brigade which was formed in 1957. The first fire vehicle was a private truck with a 200-gallon water tank, a Finsberry pump and a <b>valve</b> <b>2-way</b> radio. In the 1960s the Brigade {{purchased}} a 1942 Chev [...] "Biltz" [...] unit from the N.S.W. Forestry Department at Bateman's Bay for 300 pounds. This unit had served as a decontamination unit in World War 2., it has been restored and retained for promotional and heritage use. In 1988 the Brigade split into two; these were the Williamsdale Bush Fire Brigade (N.S.W.) and the Guises Creek Volunteer Bushfire Brigade (A.C.T.).|$|R
