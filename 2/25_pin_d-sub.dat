5000|$|Early SCSI {{interfaces}} {{commonly used}} a 50-pin micro ribbon connector.

Further, DB-25s were commonly used for RS-232 serial cables and also to connect parallel printers, meaning that users might accidentally try to use completely inappropriate cables, since the printer and serial cables would fit the connector properly and be hard to visually distinguish. The DB-25's only advantage was that it was smaller than a CN50.|$|R

40|$|Background: Management of open tibial diaphyseal {{fractures}} with {{bone loss}} {{is a matter}} of debate. The treatment options range from external fixators, nailing, ring fixators or grafting with or without plastic reconstruction. All the procedures have their own set of complications, like acute docking problems, shortening, difficulty in soft tissue management, chronic infection, increased morbidity, multiple surgeries, longer hospital stay, mal union, nonunion and higher patient dissatisfaction. We evaluated the outcome of the limb reconstruction system (LRS) in the treatment of open fractures of tibial diaphysis with bone loss as a definative mode of treatment to achieve union, as well as limb lengthening, simultaneously. Materials and Methods: Thirty open fractures of tibial diaphysis with bone loss of at least 4 cm or more with a mean age 32. 5 years were treated by using the LRS after debridement. Distraction osteogenesis at rate of 1 mm/day was done away from the fracture site to maintain the limb length. On the approximation of fracture ends, the dynamized LRS was left for further 15 - 20 weeks and patient was mobilized with weight bearing to achieve union. Functional assessment was done by Association for the Study and Application of the Methods of Illizarov (ASAMI) criteria. Results: Mean followup period was 15 months. The mean bone loss was 5. 5 cm (range 4 - 9 cm). The mean duration of bone transport was 13 weeks (range 8 - 30 weeks) with a mean time for LRS in place was 44 weeks (range 24 - 51 weeks). The mean implant index was 56. 4 days/cm. Mean union time was 52 weeks (range 31 - 60 weeks) with mean union index of 74. 5 days/cm. Bony results as per the ASAMI scoring were excellent in 76 % (19 / 25), good in 12 % (3 / 25) and fair in 4 % (1 / 25) with union in all except 2 patients, which showed poor results (8 %) with only 2 patients having leg length discrepancy more than 2. 5 cm. Functional results were excellent in 84 % (21 / 25), good in 8 % (2 / 25), fair in 8 % (2 / <b>25).</b> <b>Pin</b> tract infection was seen in 5 cases, out of which 4 being superficial, which healed to dressings and antibiotics. One patient had a deep infection which required frame removal. Conclusion: Limb reconstruction system proved to be an effective modality of treatment in cases of open fractures of the tibia with bone loss as definite modality of treatment for damage control as well as for achieving union and lengthening, simultaneously, with the advantage of early union with attainment of limb length, simple surgical technique, minimal invasive, high patient compliance, easy wound management, lesser hospitalization and the lower rate of complications like infection, deformity or shortening...|$|R

40|$|In late July 2012, the Region 24 Complex fire {{consumed}} over 76, 000 {{acres of}} north central Nebraska. This area consists of ponderosa pine forest with high densities of eastern redcedar, deciduous hardwood forest, and Sandhills prairie. This incredible event provided an occasion {{to examine the}} effect of the fire on soil nitrification and soil erosion at The Nature Conservancy’s Niobrara Valley Preserve. Eighteen 900 m 2 plots were established in regions chosen for their topographic location (footslope, midslope, and ridgetop), forest density, and directional slope (north vs. south facing slope). Each plot was split into nine subplots with <b>25</b> erosion <b>pins</b> installed in the center subplot. These pins displayed soil activity per month. Soil samples were taken in all subplots, except in the center subplot where erosion pins were installed. Erosion data was highly variable, but a correlation was shown between tree density and soil activity. Each soil sample was comprised of three soil core samples (15 cm) randomly selected in each subplot. Using KCl extraction, results showed that high nitrate and ammonia rates correlate with slope, soil pH, and tree density. The available soil nitrogen was shown to increase with basal area of eastern redcedar, indicating that ladder fuels like cedar add to the intensity of the fire and therefore the lasting impacts on the area’s resources. A mini-disk infiltrometer was used to test for soil hydraulic conductivity and hydrophobicity. The results indicated that further testing of the soil profile was needed to evaluate hydrophobicity, but soils within areas of higher densities of trees were indicating hydrophobic characteristics. Further research is needed to understand the complete relationship between the soil health and the wildfire, {{especially when it comes to}} eastern redcedar encroachment on these ecosystems...|$|R

The obtained orthorhombicity of the reoxidized material decreases with decreasing temperature of the reduction treatment. No change in the structural state is obtained when the reducing treatment is performed below 950 K; the reoxidized samples remain macroscopically tetragonal. Annealing the samples at 1073 K in oxygen restores the tweed structure. An evolution of the tweed structure with annealing time towards orthorhombic long-range order was not observed. ...|$|R
