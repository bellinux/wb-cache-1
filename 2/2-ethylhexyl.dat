50|$|One of {{the main}} Cetane Improver {{additives}} manufactured today is <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> nitrate (CAS n°: 27247-96-7) which starts to decompose at 130 °C. <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> nitrate {{is the result of}} the reaction of 2-ethylhexanol and nitric acid.|$|E
5000|$|... bis(2-ethylhexyl){{phthalate}} + H2O [...] <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> phthalate + 2-ethylhexan-1-ol ...|$|E
5000|$|... <b>2-Ethylhexyl</b> {{acrylate}} is {{together with}} butyl acrylate {{one of the}} major base monomers for the preparation of acrylate adhesives. <b>2-Ethylhexyl</b> acrylate can be react by free-radical polymerization to macromolecules having a molecular weight of up to 200,000 g/mol. Other monomers such as vinyl acetate, methyl acrylate, styrene or molecules having functional groups may be copolymerized to modify the properties of the resulting polymer.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>2-Ethylhexyl</b> {{acrylate}} {{chemical compound}} which {{belongs to the}} acrylates. It is a colorless liquid with a sweet odour.|$|E
50|$|Thus, the two {{substrates}} of this enzyme are bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate and H2O, whereas its two {{products are}} <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> phthalate and 2-ethylhexan-1-ol.|$|E
50|$|Alkyl nitrates (principally <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> nitrate) and di-tert-butyl {{peroxide}} {{are used as}} additives to raise the cetane number. Examples of such additives on the market are Opti-Lube Boost! Formula ValvTect's Diesel Guard http://valvtect.com/dieselguard.asp and Pure Cetane.|$|E
50|$|Downstream {{of one of}} {{the former}} superfund sites on Saint Johns Creek, the {{concentration}} of acetone rangesd from 18.9 to 19.7 parts per billion and the concentration of methylene chloride ranged from 0 to 68 parts per billion in 1985. The concentration of 2-butanone ranged from 46.8 to 88.4 parts per billion and the concentration of 4-Methyl-2-pentanone ranged from 4.5 to 16.1 parts per billion. The concentration of Bis (<b>2-Ethylhexyl)</b> Phthalate ranged from 0 to 468 parts per billion. Upstream of the former superfund site, the concentrations of acetone, 2-butanone, 4-Methyl-2-pentanone, and Bis (<b>2-Ethylhexyl)</b> Phthalate were all 0 parts per billion. The concentration of methylene chloride ranged from 0 to 15 parts per billion.|$|E
50|$|The racemic <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> {{acrylate}} can {{be prepared}} with a high yield by esterification of acrylic acid with racemic 2-ethylhexanol {{in the presence of}} hydroquinone as a polymerization inhibitor and a strong acid such as methanesulfonic acid by reactive distillation using toluene as azeotroping agent.|$|E
5000|$|Almost all 2-ethylhexanol {{manufactured}} {{is used as}} {{a precursor}} for the synthesis of the diester bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a plasticizer. Because it is a fatty alcohol, its esters tend to have emollient properties. For example, the sunscreen octocrylene contains a <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> ester for this purpose.|$|E
5000|$|The alkyl {{groups can}} be {{branched}} and linear alkanes between 1-14 carbons length, 2-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, 1,3-dimethylbutyl, heptyl, octyl, isooctyl (<b>2-ethylhexyl),</b> 6-methylheptyl, 1-methylpropyl, dodecylphenyl, and others. A mix of zinc dialkyl(C3-C6)dithiophosphates come under CAS number [...] List of other examples with their CAS numbers is here.|$|E
50|$|Acrylic acid {{undergoes}} {{the typical}} reactions of a carboxylic acid. When reacted with an alcohol, it forms the corresponding ester. The esters and salts of acrylic acid are collectively known as acrylates (or propenoates). The most common alkyl {{esters of acrylic acid}} are methyl, butyl, ethyl, and <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> acrylate.|$|E
50|$|Octyl salicylate, or <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> salicylate, is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{used as an}} ingredient in sunscreens and cosmetics to absorb UVB (ultraviolet) rays from the sun. It is an ester formed by the condensation of a salicylic acid with 2-ethylhexanol. It is a colorless oily liquid with a slight floral odor.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>2-Ethylhexyl</b> {{acrylate}} does polymerize easily. The polymerization can {{be initiated}} by light, peroxides, heat or even contaminates. It can react violently {{when combined with}} strong oxidants and can form explosive mixtures with air at temperatures above 82 C. The chemical, physical and toxicological properties, however, can be greatly modified by additives or stabilizers.|$|E
50|$|Padimate O is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{related to the}} water-soluble compound PABA (4-aminobenzoic acid) that is used as an ingredient in some sunscreens. This yellowish water-insoluble oily liquid is an ester formed by the condensation of 2-ethylhexanol with dimethylaminobenzoic acid. Other names for padimate O include <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> 4-dimethylaminobenzoate, Escalol 507, octyldimethyl PABA, and OD-PABA.|$|E
50|$|Dichlorprop is a {{carboxylic}} acid, {{and like}} related herbicides with free acid groups, {{it is often}} sold as a salt or ester. Currently, the <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> ester is used commercially. The butoxyethyl and isooctyl esters were once popular, but are no longer approved for agricultural use. For the salts, the dimethylamine salt is still available, while the diethanolamine salt is no longer used.|$|E
50|$|Cetane index {{calculations}} can {{not account}} for cetane improver additives and therefore do not measure total cetane number for additized diesel fuels. Diesel engine operation is primarily related to the actual cetane number, and the cetane index is simply an estimation of the base (unadditized) cetane number. Cetane number should equal or exceed cetane index, depending on the amount of additive used. The most common additive is <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> nitrate (2EHN).|$|E
50|$|Ethyl {{acrylate}} is a reactant for homologous alkyl acrylates (acrylic esters) by transesterification {{with higher}} alcohols through acidic or basic catalysis. In that way speciality acrylates are made accessible, e.g. <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> acrylate (from 2-ethylhexanol) used for pressure-sensitive adhesives, cyclohexyl acrylate (from cyclohexanol) used for automotive clear lacquers, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (from ethylene glycol) which is crosslinkable with diisocyanates to form gels used with long-chain acrylates (from C18+ alcohols) as comonomer for comb polymers for {{reduction of the}} solidification point of paraffin oils and 2-dimethylaminoethyl acrylate (from dimethylaminoethanol) for the preparation of flocculants for sewage clarification and paper production.|$|E
5000|$|The pure dyes {{found in}} modern liquid {{petroleum}} dyes are essentially longer alkyl side chain forms of traditional dyes and normally multiple chain length {{variations of the}} chromophore are found within a typical commercial liquid petroleum dye.For instance, Sudan Red 462 is essentially Solvent Red 19, with the ethyl side chain replaced by either a <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> or a tridecyl side chain. The longer branched side chains improve solubility dramatically, {{but in some cases}} the high solubility prevents the dye being isolated as a crystal, except at very low temperatures.The high solubility liquid dyes originated with Morton International and BASF (ACNA Italy) as the primary inventors.For instance, Morton International created Solvent Blue 98 as a high solubility form of Solvent Blue 35. BASF created Solvent Blue 79 as its high solubility form of Solvent Blue 35.In some cases it is possible, with normal solvents—e.g., xylene—to prepare stable (to -20C) solutions at 65% [...] "solids" [...] content. The original powder dye form of the chromophore would not be soluble beyond 2% in xylene.|$|E
