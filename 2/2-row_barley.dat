Kola nut and coffee were domesticated in Africa. In New Guinea, ancient Papuan peoples began practicing agriculture around 7,000 BC, domesticating sugarcane and taro. In the Indus Valley from the eighth millennium BC onwards at Mehrgarh, <b>2-row</b> and 6-row <b>barley</b> were cultivated, along with einkorn, emmer, and durum wheats, and dates.
