40|$|Layered birnessite-type {{manganese}} oxides (Na-OL- 1) were prepared via a redox reaction involving MnO 4 - and Mn 2 + under markedly alkaline conditions. According to the XRD analysis, the resulting material exhibited a well-crystallized octahedral layer (OL) structure with several different phases, including beta-MnOOH, alpha-MnOOH and gamma-Mn 3 O 4. The catalyst was highly effective for the decolorization and degradation of methylene blue (MB) {{in the presence}} of H 2 O 2 at neutral pH. The tested MB was completely decolorized in Na-OL- <b>1</b> <b>suspension</b> by the fraction dosing of H 2 O 2 (556. 5 mM at the beginning and then 183. 8 mM at 40 min). Based on the studies of electron spin resonance and the effect of radical scavengers, the O- <b>1</b> (<b>2)</b> and O- 2 (center dot-) were the main reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the reaction. It was found that both oxygen and ROS were generated from the decomposition of H 2 O <b>2</b> in Na-OL- <b>1</b> <b>suspension,</b> wherein the decomposition pathways were proposed. The generation of H 2 O <b>2</b> in Na-OL- <b>1</b> <b>suspension</b> at air atmosphere indicated that the existence of multivalent {{manganese oxides}} greatly enhanced the interfacial electron transfer, leading to the high activity of Na-OL- 1.

This solution in <b>2</b> S <b>1</b> tracked platform is applied to improve body vehicle stability and driving comfort. The solution is applied in two versions of the <b>2</b> S <b>1</b> vehicle <b>suspension</b> model. First one is a basic model. This suspension is based on existing construction of the <b>2</b> S <b>1</b> platform <b>suspension.</b> It is based on torsion bars. Second one is a modified model, based on spiral torsion springs. In this model a new {{solution of}} idler mechanism is applied. It provides constant tension of the tracks. Semi-active suspensions simulations results are compared with results of models with passive versions of the suspension to highlight the improvement level. Simulations are conducted in the Yuma Proving Ground conditions.

40|$|The {{effect of}} TiO 2 {{photocatalysis}} on the inactivation of an antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli strain selected from an urban {{wastewater treatment plant}} (UWWTP) effluent was investigated. Different light sources including a 250 W wide spectrum lamp, a 125 W UV-A lamp and solar radiation, as well as, photocatalysts loadings (TiO 2 Degussa P 25) {{in the range from}} 0. 05 to 2. 00 g TiO <b>2</b> L− <b>1</b> were evaluated. The higher efficiency (total bacterial inactivation after 10 min of irradiation) was observed in the absence of TiO 2 when the wastewater was irradiated using the 250 W lamp. In the presence of TiO 2 a decreasing inactivation trend was observed (99. 76 % and 72. 22 % inactivation after 10 min irradiation at 0. 10 and 2. 00 g TiO <b>2</b> L− <b>1</b> respectively). Under solar simulated conditions the highest inactivation efficiency (93. 17 %) after 10 min of irradiation was achieved at the lower photocatalyst loading (0. 05 g TiO <b>2</b> L− <b>1).</b> The concept of “reactor optical thickness” was introduced to explain the rates of disinfection observed. The optimum photocatalyst loading estimated by radiation absorption-scattering modeling was found to be 0. <b>1</b> g TiO <b>2</b> L− <b>1</b> for all lamps. The difference between experimental tests and modeling may be due to TiO 2 particles aggregation. Comparative kinetic tests between solar and solar simulated photocatalytic (SSP) processes using 0. 05 g TiO <b>2</b> L− <b>1</b> in <b>suspension</b> showed a quite similar inactivation behavior up to 30 min of irradiation, but only the SSP process resulted in a total inactivation of bacteria after 60 min of exposure.

Suspensions of M. tuberculosis, M. avium, M. intracellulare, M. kansasii, and M. thermoresistibile were evaluated across five ovens. The organism suspensions were spiked into pooled NALC/NaOH digested and decontaminated sputa and processed as they would be in routine mycobacterial testing on the BDProbeTec ™ ET System.

Current treatment options {{for patients with}} second-stage disease are either highly toxic or impracticable in field conditions. We compared the efficacy and safety of the nifurtimox-eflornithine drug combination with the standard eflornithine regimen {{for the treatment of}} second-stage disease. Methods. A randomized, open-label, active-control, phase III clinical trial comparing 2 arms was conducted at the Sleeping Sickness Treatment Center, which was run by Médecins Sans Frontières, in Nkayi, Bouenza Province, Republic of Congo. Patients were screened for inclusion and randomly assigned to receive eflornithine alone (400 mg/kg per day given intravenously every 6 h for 14 days) or eflornithine (400 mg/kg per day given intravenously every 12 h for 7 days) plus nifurtimox (15 mg/kg per day given orally every 8 h for 10 days). Patients were observed for 18 months. The study’s outcomes were cure and adverse events attributable to treatment. Results. A total of 103 patients with second-stage disease were enrolled. Cure rates were 94. 1 % for the eflornithine group and 96. 2 % for the nifurtimox-eflornithine group.

40|$|The {{bioconversion}} of the lignan desoxypodophyllotoxin by cell suspensions of Linum flavum and of Podophyllum hexandrum was investigated. The apolar substrate {{could be}} easily dissolved in the culture medium at a concentration of 2 mM by complexation with dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Growth parameters of the cell suspensions were not affected by either the addition of cyclodextrin itself, or when cyclodextrin-complexed desoxypodophyllotoxin was present in the medium. The complexed lignan disappeared from the medium within 7 days for both cell cultures. Cellularly only small amounts of desoxypodophyllotoxin were found. After feeding of desoxypodophyllotoxin, the cell culture of L. flavum accumulated 5 -methoxypodophyllotoxin and 5 -methoxypodophyllotox in-beta-D-glucoside. After 7 days a total maximal content of 2. 38 % on a dry weight basis of 5 -methoxypodophyllotoxin was formed, corresponding with 249 mg <b>1</b> (- <b>1)</b> <b>suspension.</b> The highest bioconversion percentage of 52. 3 % was found at day 14.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate and compare the microfiltration characteristics of mixed algal cultures containing two species of green microalgae: Chlorella vulgaris and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Submerged membrane filtration experiments with 300 mg L- <b>1</b> <b>suspensions</b> of pure algal cultures indicated that while membrane fouling potential was comparable in both cases, Chlorella vulgaris had a lower cake formation potential. Filtration experiments were carried out with 1000 mg L- <b>1</b> <b>suspensions</b> of mixed algal culture over several 12 -h cycles with backwashing, either in the on-line or off-line mode. While on-line backwashing caused more fouling, this did not significantly affect the flux through the membrane, which was controlled by the cake formation on the membrane. The algal mixed culture was also filtered over many 3 -h cycles with on-line backwashing. Lower cycle duration resulted in lower average cake resistance and hence allowed more membrane throughput, but at the cost of more frequent backwashing. Chemical washing of the membrane could remove the fouling resistance only partially. Thus, despite periodic chemical washing, the intrinsic membrane resistance increased consistently with cumulative throughput through the membrane. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
