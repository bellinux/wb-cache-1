As more hearing adults seek to learn ASL, it is beneficial to better understand how these adults learn a manual language and where challenges may occur in language acquisition. This paper explores hearing learners?? abilities in acquiring the five phonological parameters of signs: handshape, movement, location, palm orientation, and non-manual signals (NMS). This was done by examining ASL <b>2</b> (<b>second</b> <b>semester)</b> and ASL 4 (fourth semester) students?? perception of sign parameters through a minimal pairs task and multiple choice task related to accurate sign production. Additionally, students were asked to produce signs both in isolation and in a sentence. Results indicate that learners are generally able to perceive differences, but struggle to determine when signs are correctly articulated. In perception, learners made the least errors in location and palm orientation alterations, followed by movement and handshape. NMS were more difficult for more advanced students, indicating that this is the last parameter that learners acquire. More advanced students are more accurate in production and perform at the same level of their perceptual accuracy, but they are no more perceptually accurate than less advanced learners. For learners to improve in their perception and production abilities, they may require explicit teaching of parameters and their importance in sign formation...|$|E

This classroom-based project designed to investigate the teachability of pragmatics, focused on four intact classes at two different proficiency levels, using a quasi-experimental research design with the following structure: pretest - treatment - posttest - and delayed posttest. Participants were enrolled in a program of Foreign Languages at a university in Colombia. Two groups of students of basic English <b>2</b> (<b>second</b> <b>semester)</b> and two groups of students of intermediate English 1 (fifth semester) were the participants. The four groups received a written discourse completion test (WDCT) and a paired video-taped role-play (RP) as pretests. Results from the WDCT showed {{no significant differences between the}} two groups at each level, so the type of treatment (T 1 : pragmatics-based, and T 2 : institutionally imparted) was randomly assigned to the groups at each level. Treatment 1 provided learners with sociopragmatic and pragmalinguistic information and practice of receptive and productive skills in the TL. The treatment lasted 20 hours distributed across three weeks, after which, all the participants received a post-test in the same two forms taken by the pretest. The comparison of paired samples between the pre-test and the post-test, and the comparison of multivariate means between groups at each level showed significant differences that confirmed the efficiency of the pragmatics-based instruction, although improvement was more evident in WDCT performance than in RP performance. The qualitative analysis indicated progress in the ability to perform the expected speech act, the use of typical expressions, and the amount of information given. Improvement was also salient in macrolevel cultural aspects such as the expression of appropriate levels of formality, directness and politeness for the realizations of requests, apologies and compliments, as measured by the WDCT and the RP. The delayed post-test suggests that the pragmatics-oriented instruction favored both retention and improvement for the WDCT, while for the RP, the main effect was retention...|$|E

The 264 students took the test twice－one in the first semester and the other in the <b>second</b> <b>semester.</b> The average total score in the <b>second</b> <b>semester</b> was significantly higher than that of the first semester. A more in-depth analysis revealed the following tendencies: (a) those who scored higher in the first semester tended to produce much lower scores in the second semester; (b) conversely, those who scored lower in the first semester tended to score much higher in all sections of the test in the <b>second</b> <b>semester.</b> This suggests that the classes were more effective for lessproficient students of English than for students with higher degrees of English proficiency. The declining scores of the more-proficient students in the <b>second</b> <b>semester</b> might be in part because the classes were not offered on a proficiency basis. In conclusion, {{the findings of this study}} would seem to suggest that serious measures need to be taken to improve the English proficiency of the students with higher scores and not just the low-level ones. 是枝正啓教授、内田滋教授定年退職記念号In Honour of Prof. Masahiro Koreeda and Prof. Shigeru Uchid...|$|R
