25|$|BPA {{has been}} found to bind to both of the nuclear {{estrogen}} receptors (ERs), ERα and ERβ. It is 1000- to <b>2000-fold</b> less potent than estradiol. The drug can both mimic the action of estrogen and antagonize estrogen, indicating that it is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) or partial agonist of the ER. At high concentrations, BPA also binds to and acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR). In addition to receptor binding, the compound {{has been found}} to affect Leydig cell steroidogenesis, including affecting 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase and aromatase expression and interfering with LH receptor-ligand binding.|$|E
25|$|Eculizumab is {{controversial}} {{due to its}} high cost, as it {{is among the most}} expensive pharmaceuticals in the world, with a price of US$440,000 per person per year. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that acts as a terminal complement inhibitor. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a black-box warning for eculizumab whose recipients have a 1,000 to <b>2,000-fold</b> greater risk of invasive meningococcal disease compared to the general U.S. population. Patients for whom eculizumab is prescribed are strongly advised by the FDA to receive meningococcal vaccination at least two weeks prior to starting therapy and to consider antimicrobial prophylaxis for the duration of treatment with eculizumab.|$|E

5000|$|... 2-ME2 {{is derived}} from estradiol, {{although}} it binds poorly (<b>2000-fold</b> lower activational potency) to known estrogen receptors. However, 2-ME2 retains activity as a high-affinity agonist of the GPER (GPR30).|$|E
50|$|The Colorado potato beetle {{has evolved}} {{resistance}} to 52 different compounds belonging to all major insecticide classes. Resistance levels vary across populations and between beetle life stages, {{but in some}} cases can be very high (up to <b>2,000-fold).</b>|$|E
50|$|Average cost of manufacturer's {{liability}} insurance for each airplane {{manufactured in the}} U.S. had risen from approximately $50 per plane in 1962 to $100,000 per plane in 1988, {{according to a report}} cited by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a <b>2,000-fold</b> increase in 24 years.|$|E
50|$|SN-38 is an antineoplastic drug. It is {{the active}} {{metabolite}} of irinotecan (an analog of camptothecin - a topoisomerase I inhibitor) but has 1000 times more activity than irinotecan itself. In vitro cytotoxicity assays {{show that the}} potency of SN-38 relative to irinotecan varies from 2- to <b>2000-fold.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} the {{usefulness}} in cell tracking and cell visualization of Kaede, there are some limitations. Although Kaede will shift to red upon the exposure of UV or violet light and display a <b>2,000-fold</b> increase in red-to-green fluorescence ratio, using both the red and green fluorescence bands can cause problems in multilabel experiments. The tetramerization of Kaede may disturb the localization and trafficking of fusion proteins. This limits the usefulness of Kaede as a fusion protein tag.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two options}} for realizing apertureless NSOM-Raman technique: TERS and SERS. TERS is {{frequently}} used for apertureless NSOM-Raman and can significantly enhance the spatial resolution. This technique requires a metal tip {{to enhance the}} signal of the sample. That is why an AFM metal tip is usually used for enhancing the electric field for molecule excitation. Raman spectroscopy was combined with AFM in 1999. A very narrow aperture of the tip was required to obtain a relatively high spatial resolution; such aperture reduced the signal and was difficult to prepare. In 2000, Stȍckle et al. first designed a setup combining apertureless NSOM, Raman and AFM techniques, in which the tip had a 20 nm thick granular silver film on it. They reported a large gain in the Raman scattering intensity of a dye film (brilliant cresyl blue) deposited on a glass substrate if a metal-coated AFM tip was brought {{very close to the}} sample. About <b>2000-fold</b> enhancement of Raman scattering and a spatial resolution of ~55 nm were achieved.|$|E
