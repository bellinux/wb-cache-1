2500|$|Alcohols {{are then}} {{classified}} into primary, secondary (sec-, s-), and tertiary (tert-, t-), {{based upon the}} number of carbon atoms connected to the carbon atom that bears the hydroxyl functional group. (The respective numeric shorthands 1°, 2°, and 3° are also sometimes used in informal settings.) The primary alcohols have general formulas RCH2OH. The simplest primary alcohol is methanol (CH3OH), for which R=H, and the next is ethanol, for which R=CH3, the methyl group. Secondary alcohols {{are those of the}} form RR'CHOH, the simplest of which is 2-propanol (R=R'=CH3). For the tertiary alcohols the general form is RR'R"COH. The simplest example is tert-butanol (<b>2-methylpropan-2-ol),</b> for which each of R, R', and R" [...] is CH3. In these shorthands, R, R', and R" [...] represent substituents, alkyl or other attached, generally organic groups.|$|E
