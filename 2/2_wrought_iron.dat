Credit {{for the development of}} pipeline transport is disputed, with competing claims for Vladimir Shukhov and the Branobel company in the late 19th century, and the Oil Transport Association, which first constructed a <b>2</b> in <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> pipeline over a 6 mi track from an oil field in Pennsylvania to a railroad station in Oil Creek, in the 1860s. Pipelines are generally the most economical way to transport large quantities of oil, refined oil products or natural gas over land.|$|R

Yardley was an uncle of one of Penn's most trusted friends and counselors, Phineas Pemberton.

At the age of 50 in 1682, Yardley and wife Jane (nee Heath), sons Enoch, William and Thomas, and servant Andrew Heath sailed to the America on the ship Friend's Adventure.

It was of adobe construction and fashioned into a U-shape surrounding an open courtyard. The courtyard included a well and was enclosed with a 12 ft to 14 ft adobe wall with a massive gate and a smaller entrance door within the gate. The building probably contained only three rooms and featured an 18 ft by 20 ft jail cell 8 ft below the sheriff's office and guard room accessible through a trap door.

50|$|<b>Wrought</b> <b>iron</b> {{furniture}} {{has a long}} history, {{dating back}} to Roman times. There are 13th-century <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> gates in Westminster Abbey in London, and <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> furniture appeared to reach its peak popularity (in Britain) in the 17th century {{during the reign of}} William III and Mary II.

50|$|<b>Wrought</b> <b>iron</b> may be welded in {{the same}} manner as mild steel, but the {{presence}} of oxide or inclusions will give defective results.The material has a rough surface, so it can hold platings and coatings better. For instance, a galvanic zinc finish applied to <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> is approximately 25-40% thicker than the same finish on steel. In Table 1, the chemical composition of <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> is compared to that of pig iron and carbon steel. Although it appears that <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> and plain carbon steel have similar chemical compositions, that is deceiving. Most of the manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon are incorporated into the slag fibers present in the <b>wrought</b> <b>iron,</b> so, really, <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> is purer than plain carbon steel.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Wrought</b> <b>iron</b> {{lacks the}} carbon content {{necessary}} for hardening through heat treatment, but {{in areas where}} steel was uncommon or unknown, tools were sometimes cold-worked (hence cold iron) in order to harden them. An advantage of its low carbon content is its excellent weldability. [...] Furthermore, sheet <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> cannot bend as much as steel sheet metal (when cold worked). [...] <b>Wrought</b> <b>iron</b> can be melted and cast, however the product is no longer <b>wrought</b> <b>iron,</b> since the slag stringers characteristic of <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> disappear on melting, so the product resembles impure cast Bessemer steel. There is no engineering advantage as compared to cast iron or steel, {{both of which are}} cheaper.|$|R
