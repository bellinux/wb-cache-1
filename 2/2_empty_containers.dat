In inland container transportation, freights (containers) are transported between terminal and the customer's location by trucks, trains and barges. <b>Empty</b> <b>containers</b> are an important logistic resource and shipping companies try to operate and manage <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> efficiently. Because of the trade imbalance between hub ports, <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> should be periodically repositioned from surplus areas to shortage areas.

To {{improve the}} efficiency of <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> repositioning for a shipping company, a stochastic optimization model of <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> repositioning of sea carriage was established by chance-constrained programming. The objective function was to minimize the cost of <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> repositioning including shipping, rening and shortage cost. In the model, shipping cost was decided {{by the number of}} ship used for <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> repositioning.

The logistics challenge to shipping companies is to better manage and control their containers, which consist of company-owned containers and leased <b>containers.</b> The multi-port <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> allocation problem is concerned with the allocation of <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> from supply ports to demand ports. In this paper, optimal pairs of critical policies, (U, D) for one port, which are importing <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> up to U when the number of <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> in the port is less than U, or exporting <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> down to D when the number of <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> is larger than D, doing nothing otherwise, are adapted to multi-port case so that decision-makers can make decisions about allocating the right amounts of <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> to the right ports at the right time.

40|$|A SEMI-CENTRALISED DYNAMIC STOCHASTIC MODEL FOR OPERATIONAL MARITIME <b>EMPTY</b> <b>CONTAINER</b> REPOSITIONING UNDER UNCERTAINTY Maritime {{shipping}} containers {{are responsible}} for slashing transportation costs and improving the bottom line. Yet <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> need to be repositioned globally between seaports and regionally between consignees, inland depots, and terminals to meet customer demand. Previous research has focused primarily on the repositioning of <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> between seaports or on land. However, limited {{research has been conducted}} on the operational coordination mechanisms of <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> repositioning, which could include loading, unloading, inventory, leasing, and in particular postponing and transhipment activities. Specifically, when the supply and demand of <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> and ship capacity are subject to uncertainty, available information systems are not capable of estimating the uncertain parameters and providing up-to-date information required for informed and effective decision making. This thesis develops a semi-centralised dynamic stochastic <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> repositioning decision-making model for the operational management of <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> in a multi-community, multi-level, and multi-period shipping network. The proposed model ensures an efficient and rational allocation of <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> in the shipping network while optimising a port’s operations. The proposed model consists of two phases. First, headquarters make weekly decisions about the delivery of <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> to ports. This is done using a multi-stage stochastic linear optimisation mathematical model based on weekly information from all ports. These decisions result in a plan for operational real-time decisions at the port level. After receiving the plan for the target delivery for the week, the ports then develop their own <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> management plans using a multi-criteria, multi-stage stochastic programming model based on daily regional information that takes into account any possible gaps between target delivery and actual demand as well as port-specific constraints and priorities. The applicability of the proposed <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> repositioning decision-making model is demonstrated with a numerical experiment consisting of multiple ports and multiple routes with multiple planning horizons. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is more useful and less costly than existing models at assisting shipping companies with meeting the demand for <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> under conditions of uncertainty.

However, significant sources of uncertainty may still affect this issue. This is because in many occasions, due to maintenance, economic reasons, or technical difficulties, we have lack of observed data about an unknown state of nature. For example, since loaded containers have greater priority than <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> and unexpected transportation opportunities may arise, the residual transportation capacity for <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> also fails to provide certain information. Moreover, {{the maximum number of}} <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> that can be loaded and unloaded in ports is sometimes uncertain as well. Information on the number of <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> requested in each port may also be imprecise, because unexpected transportation demands may arise. Moreover, the number of <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> available in ports can also be uncertain, because we do not know precisely when they will be returned by import customers. In such cases where information is not sufficient, we have to invite some domain experts to evaluate their belief degree for events’ occurrence. When only belief degrees are available (no samples), the estimated uncertainty distribution usually deviates far from the cumulative frequency. In this case, the uncertainty theory can be referred as one of the legitimate approaches (Liu 2007, 2010, 2012).|$|R

A polynomial-time algorithm is developed to determine the two thresholds, that is, A n and S n, for each period. Next, we formulate the multi-port problem and determine a tight lower bound on the cost function. On the basis of the two-threshold optimal policy for a single port, a polynomial-time algorithm is developed to find an approximate repositioning policy for multi-ports. Simulation results show that the proposed approximate repositioning algorithm performs very effectively and efficiently. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R

40|$|There {{is little}} doubt that the {{requirement}} to reposition <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> {{is one of the more}} persistent problems in the container transport industry, and is a key factor in cutting operating costs. <b>Empty</b> <b>container</b> transport involves high costs, particularly for shipping lines, since they generally bear these container management costs.

This thesis proposes a 3 -stage framework to handle <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> logistics with cost management as the objective. The first stage studies the forecasting of laden shipment demand, which provides the <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> supply requirement. Based on the supply needs, the problem of optimizing the fleet size was then addressed by using an inventory model to establish the optimal safety stock level. Simulations were used to understand the sensitivity of safety stock to desired service level. The final stage involves using mathematical programming to optimize repositioning costs incurred by carriers to ship <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> to places which need them due to trade imbalance. At the same time, costs that are incurred due to leasing and storage are considered. A comparison between just-in-time and pre-emptive replenishment was performed and impact due to uncertainties is investigated. The framework is then implemented in a Decision Support System for an actual ocean carrier and is used to assist the <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> logistics team to take {{the best course of}} action in daily operations.

Based on direct observations and in-depth interviews with a panel of thirty experts in the physical movement of <b>empty</b> <b>containers,</b> the results indicated that the most frequent causes of bottlenecks that stakeholders perceived included work attitudes, operations handling, monitoring, information and facilities/others. Of these, the ‘operations handling’ related to container depots was considered the most significant identifiable barrier to container movements. The research outcomes should assist the container chain players to understand the practice requirements for <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> in Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} on strategies for port planning, concerning the storage {{and flow of}} <b>empty</b> marine <b>containers</b> in the port of Rotterdam. The aim {{of this research is}} to give insight in the effects of port planning strategies of the Rotterdam Port Authority (RPA), regarding storage facilities for <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> (<b>empty</b> depots) at the Port of Rotterdam (PoR). Empty depots generate transport of <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> (often by truck), and increasingly require port terrain. Given the expected growth of trade volumes, the environmental regulations {{and the quality of the}} accessibiliy of the PoR requires a planning strategy for empty depots. In the allocation of storage areas for <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> the RPA needs to decide upon the location, the quantity, the dimensions of the required area, the related infrastructure (which impacts the accessibility of the port) and the lease price of empty depot terrain.
