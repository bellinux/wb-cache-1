Using comparative analysis I reveal why all of Visegrád countries reduce <b>2</b> nd <b>pillar</b> after several years of its functioning. The most common reason for this reducing was an effort to improve the unsatisfactory situation of public finances. The abolition of <b>2</b> nd <b>pillar</b> actually leads to a certain improvement of public debt and deficit, but this positive effect is only short-term. More specifically I focus on the arguments of the Government for the abolition of the funded pillar in the Czech Republic, which I consider largely baseless.

40|$|Struggling {{to create}} an {{anonymous}} revolution of thought, the Freemasons were forced to endorse their ideals through indirect yet seemingly conspicuous efforts due to the controversy these principles caused among the Catholic Church and patriarchal society. Many of the beliefs of Freemasons were publicized using music as a pathway, with Wolfgang Mozart defining this form of propaganda. Current literature describes the textual, musical, and historical allusions to the founding ideologies of freemasonry in Mozart 2 ̆ 7 s Magic Flute. However, despite the abundance of evidence tying the musical composition or literary analysis to Freemasonry, an amalgamation of these elements in The Magic Flute {{has yet to be}} written. By uniting the musical and textual inferences and adding historical parallels of freemasonry in The Magic Flute, I contend that the purpose of this opera indisputably promotes the ideals of freemasonry: unification of mankind through the bonds of brotherhood and equality. Throughout the history of the Freemasons, music emphasized the fraternity of mankind, acting as an equalizer between upper and lower classes. Freemasons embodied these ideals in the three <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> <b>pillars</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2 of masonry: wisdom, strength, and beauty, represented in each member and Lodge. Masonic influence in music incorporates this through the growth of two characters, Tamino and Sarastro, as both embody these three <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> <b>pillars</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2 of masonry. Both characters mature to adopt the values a Freemason would possess through the libretto and musical composition in The Magic Flute, imbedding incognito messages of the Freemasons in the foundation of this opera and confirming Freemason presence in this work...|$|R

A major modification to the cluster source also enabled coating of clusters in a new way. The impact of Pd_ 5 _ 6 _ 1, Pd_ 5 _ 5 and Pd_ 4 clusters (1, 1. 5 and 1 keV) on a thin material film evaporated onto a solid argon matrix led to deposition of large, 5 - 40 nm diameter, irregularly shaped particles. Furthermore, Pd_ 9 _ 2 _ 3 and Pd_ 2 _ 0 _ 0 _ 0 clusters, with both 0. 5 and 1. 5 keV impact energies, have been coated in-flight by impact on the thin film/solid matrix, as verified from the increase in diameters of the deposited particles and the detection of Pd signal by EELS.

However, such LSPR-sensing devices typically contain extremely large regions of dielectric materials that are open to molecular adsorption, which must be carefully blocked to avoid compromising the device readings. To address this issue, we made the support essentially invisible to the LSPR by carefully removing the dielectric material overlapping with the localized plasmonic fields through optimized wet-etching. The resulting LSPR substrate, which consists of gold nanodisks centered on narrow SiO <b>2</b> <b>pillars,</b> exhibits markedly reduced vulnerability to nonspecific substrate adsorption, thus allowing, in an ideal case, the implementation of thicker and more efficient passivation layers.
