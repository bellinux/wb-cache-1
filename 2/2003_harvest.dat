All isolates were analyzed by mitochondrial DNA {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (mtDNA RFLP) and a pattern profile was verified for each isolate, resulting in a total of 297 different profiles, all revealed to belong to the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The strains corresponding to seventeen profiles showed a wider temporal and geographical distribution, being characterized by a generalized pattern of sporadic presence, absence and reappearance. One strain (ACP 10) showed a more regional distribution with a perennial behavior. In different fermentations ACP 10 was either dominant or not, showing that the final outcome of fermentation was dependent on the specific composition of the yeast community in the must. Few of the grape samples collected before harvest initiated a spontaneous fermentation, compared to the samples collected after harvest, in a time frame of about 2 weeks. The associated strains were also much more diversified: 267 patterns among 1260 isolates compared to 30 patterns among 360 isolates in the post- and pre-harvest samples respectively.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} research {{addressed the}} fundamental question of what the general microbial flora within the oyster is and what influence depuration and relay have on bacterial communities in the oyster. Comparisons of bacterial community profiles were made using culture-dependent and culture-independent isolation techniques and a nested PCR-DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) approach. Differences {{in the composition of}} the bacterial community between culture-dependent and culture-independent profiles were detected. The effect of culture-based techniques is significant and results in a biased representation of community structure. This bias may be minimized for the oyster compared to the large differences typically detected between culturable and total microbial communities from a sample, since external and internal surfaces of the oyster supply a nutrient rich micro-environment not unlike an enrichment broth. These micro-environments may allow proliferation of the majority of bacterial species who specialize in these environments, thus inhibiting many of the transient non-specialist bacterial species inadvertently ingested during respiratory and feeding mechanisms. Using API 20 E test strips, dominant culturable species were identified as members of the genera Vibrio. Approximately 60 % of Vibrio isolates were V. parahaemolyticus. Additional Vibrio species included, V. alginolyticus, V. cholerae, and V. vulnificus. The remaining isolates identified by the API system were Aeromonas and Photobacterium species. ^ Oyster-associated bacterial community profiles generated from depurated and relay samples were compared using the same nested PCR-DGGE approach. Oyster-associated profiles between replicate samples within a harvest area and treatment only showed minor variations. Depuration significantly altered the relative species diversity and abundance of dominant ribotypes. Cluster analysis identified groups of ribotypes that persisted or disappeared following depuration. Relay was shown to significantly increase both relative ribotype diversity and relative abundance measures. ^ Post-harvest surveillance for Vibrio vulnificus by a commercial processing facility was conducted from May 2001 to September <b>2003.</b> <b>Harvest</b> areas included Delaware Bay, Long Island Sound, and Prince Edward Island. Occurrence followed a seasonal distribution. Low densities were observed in June, increased through August, and became rare by September.

40|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} barriers to further roofwater harvesting at the household level are high cost and inadequate service. Systems are too expensive for householders to afford them or, if the capacity is reduced to an affordable level, {{it is seen as}} too small to provide adequate service. As the cost of a rainwater harvesting system is a function of its capacity, these two problems are heavily interrelated. For some years there has been in existence a “sanitation ladder”, a catalogue of designs of varying quality from which a project manager, a community or individual can select an appropriate well designed sanitation system to suit local conditions and the available funds. Such “ranges ” are the norm in consumer products and usually form the basis for consumer choice. Rainwater harvesting systems are very amenable to this product-range approach, as no account of local geology and topography need be taken: the water simply falls from the sky. They are however, slightly more complex than sanitation systems as there are, in effect two ladders, one for service provision – mainly a function of system size and one for quality of construction. It is in fact this quality aspect that is predominant in the sanitation ladder whereas roofwater harvesting systems are dominated by the question of size with a certain quality taken as read. Systems of different sizes and qualities can be clearly presented alongside forecasts of the service they will provide and a community can decide on the solution that is best for them.

Organic fertilizer (alfalfa pellets, 112 kg/ha/week) was used to increase primary production and inorganic fertilizers were added periodically to maintain a target nutrient ratio of 7 : 1 nitratenitrogen to total phosphorus (NO 3 -N: TP). Additional nutrients in the form of Lansy CW fish feed were added to three of the six ponds. The objective of this project was to determine the effect of a commercial fish diet on water quality. At the end of the culture season, there were significant differences between water chemistry parameters in the ponds; the feed treatments had higher levels of nitrogenous compounds and total phosphorus...|$|R
