5000|$|... 2-Deoxy-D-glucose is a glucose {{molecule}} {{which has}} the 2-hydroxyl group replaced by hydrogen, so that it cannot undergo further glycolysis. As such; it acts to competitively inhibit the production of glucose-6-PO4 from glucose at the phosphoglucoisomerase level. [...] In most cells, glucose hexokinase phosphorylates <b>2-deoxyglucose,</b> trapping the product 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate intracellularly (with exception of liver and kidney); thus, labeled forms of <b>2-deoxyglucose</b> serve as a good marker for tissue glucose uptake and hexokinase activity. Many cancers have elevated glucose uptake and hexokinase levels. <b>2-Deoxyglucose</b> labeled with tritium or carbon-14 has been a popular ligand for laboratory research in animal models, where distribution is assessed by tissue-slicing followed by autoradiography, sometimes in tandem with either conventional or electron microscopy.|$|E
5000|$|Work on the {{ketogenic}} diet as {{a treatment}} for epilepsy have investigated the role of glycolysis in the disease. <b>2-Deoxyglucose</b> has been proposed by Garriga-Canut et al. as a mimic for the ketogenic diet, and shows great promise as a new anti-epileptic drug. [...] The authors suggest that 2-DG works, in part, by increasing the expression of Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Nerve growth factor (NGF), Arc (protein) (ARC), and Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2). Such uses are {{complicated by the fact that}} <b>2-deoxyglucose</b> does have some toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) {{can also be used}} to measure metabolism of an odor. This method is not terminal as is the <b>2-deoxyglucose</b> method, so one animal can be measured with many odors, and the resulted images can be compared.|$|E
5000|$|Functional {{neuroanatomy}} - A {{more complex}} counterpart of phrenology. The expression of some anatomical marker {{is taken to}} reflect neural activity. For example, the expression of immediate early genes {{is thought to be}} caused by vigorous neural activity. Likewise, the injection of <b>2-deoxyglucose</b> prior to some behavioral task can be followed by anatomical localization of that chemical; it is taken up by neurons that are electrically active.|$|E

50|$|William Joseph Schwartz, (born March 28, 1950) MD is an American {{neurologist}} and {{scientist who}} currently serves as Professor and Associate Chair for Research and Education in the neurology {{department at the}} University of Texas Dell Medical School. His work on the neurobiology of circadian timekeeping {{has focused on the}} mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Schwartz demonstrated that the SCN is rhythmic in vivo using a <b>2-deoxyglucose</b> radioactive marker for functional brain imaging. As of 2014, he is editor of the Journal of Biological Rhythms.|$|E
50|$|In 1974 Hubel and Wiesel wrote a {{paper about}} the {{geometry}} of orientation columns. They recorded 1410 cells in 45 penetrations into the striate cortex. Through this 1-dimensional technique they conceptualized that the orientation columns are not columns but slabs. In 1985, Gary Blasdel discovered a technique to visualize these orientation columns in 2D. His technique used photodiodes to detect optical changes in the visual cortex with the metabolic marker, <b>2-deoxyglucose,</b> which labels active neurons. This confirmed Hubel and Wiesel's studies and also brought to light the swirls and pinwheel formations in the striate cortex.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, {{biochemist}} Lou Sokoloff, Seymour Kety, and Floyd E. Bloom {{developed a}} way of mapping activity in the brain by tracking the rat brain's metabolization of oxygen. Nerve cells require oxygen and glucose for energy. <b>2-deoxyglucose</b> (2DG) is a radioactive glucose isotope that can be tracked in the brain since it leaves a trace in the cell where it would normally be metabolized for energy if it were glucose. After stimulation of a certain region of cells, X-ray photographs can be sliced to reveal which cells were active, particularly at synaptic junctures.|$|E

This compound inhibits glycolysis, and can mimic some of the physiological effects of CR, in particular increased insulin sensitivity, reduced glucose levels, reduced body temperature, and other biochemical changes. It was reported to extend the lives of C. elegans worms; however, studies in different strains of rats found that 2DG did not extend lifespan at several tested doses, and exhibited toxic effects [...] "Histopathological analysis of the hearts revealed increasing vacuolarization of cardiac myocytes with dose, and tissue staining revealed the vacuoles were free of both glycogen and lipid." ...|$|E
