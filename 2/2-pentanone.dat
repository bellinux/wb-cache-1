5000|$|The {{distinctive}} {{flavor and}} aroma of blue cheese arises from methyl ketones (including <b>2-pentanone,</b> 2-heptanone, and 2-nonanone) {{which are a}} metabolic product of Penicillium roqueforti. [...] These compounds are not formed in other types of cheese fermented by bacterial acidification alone.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>2-Pentanone</b> or methyl propyl ketone (MPK) is a ketone and solvent {{of minor}} importance. It is {{comparable}} to methyl ethyl ketone, but has a lower solvency and is more expensive. It occurs naturally in Nicotiana tabacum (Tobacco) and blue cheese as a metabolic product of Penicillium mold growth.|$|E

5000|$|The Japp-Maitland {{condensation}} is {{an organic}} reaction and {{a type of}} Aldol reaction and a tandem reaction. In a reaction between the ketone <b>2-pentanone</b> and the aldehyde benzaldehyde catalyzed by base the bis Aldol adduct is formed first. The second step is a ring-closing reaction when one hydroxyl group displaces {{the other in a}} nucleophilic substitution forming an oxo-tetrahydropyran.|$|E

5000|$|... 3-Pentanone (also {{known as}} diethyl ketone) is a simple, {{symmetrical}} dialkyl ketone. It is a colorless liquid ketone with an odor {{like that of}} acetone. It is soluble in about 25 parts water, but miscible with organic solvents. It is mainly used as a solvent in paint and a precursor to vitamin E. Two related and more important ketones are <b>2-pentanone</b> and methyl isopropyl ketone.|$|E
