25|$|The {{establishment}} of Law Number 16/2012 allowed Pindad {{to create the}} Komodo to their advantage, in which the law stipulates Indonesia to have local content used in the manufacturing of its defense products with international cooperation. The Komodo was designed in Pindad's Bandung, West Java manufacturing facility with a price tag of about USD$300,000. According to Pindad, the Komodo's monocoque armored body is bulletproof and it can withstand 7.62mm or lower caliber rifle and handgun bullets. The Komodo's glass is also made bulletproof. The Komodo's turbo intercooler diesel engine has a total horsepower of 215 PS at <b>2500</b> <b>rpm,</b> allowing the vehicle to achieve the weight ratio of around 30hp/ton. The Komodo can carry up to 200liters of diesel fuel. The vehicle only has a manual transmission system, which consists of 6 forward and 1 reverse gear, allowing the Komodo to have off-road capabilities. President Avianto said that the normal cruising range of the Komodo is at 450kilometers, with an average speed of 70km/h. The Komodo's off-road capabilities have been tested in various conditions ranging from mountainous terrain to mud and sand.|$|E

2500|$|Since Wankel engines {{operate at}} a {{relatively}} high rotational speed, at 6,000 rpm of output shaft, the Rotor makes only 2,000 turns. With relatively low torque, propeller driven aircraft must use a propeller speed reduction unit to maintain propellers within the designed speed range. Experimental aircraft with Wankel engines use propeller speed reduction units, for instance the MidWest twin-rotor engine has a 2.95:1 reduction gearbox. [...] The rotational shaft speed of a Wankel engine is high compared to reciprocating piston designs. Only the eccentric shaft spins fast, while the rotors turn at exactly one-third of the shaft speed. If the shaft is spinning at 7,500 rpm, the rotors are turning at a much slower <b>2,500</b> <b>rpm.</b>|$|E

Renewable energy can be produced from crude palm oil (CPO), coconut oil, jatropha curcas, etc. The use of CPO directly into a diesel engine can lead negative effects on the engine, so CPO must be firstly transesterificated. The transesterification performed in this research was quite simple and used simple facilities.

2500|$|The dual 2 [...] 30mm cannons (as well as {{the later}} 2A38M) were {{designed}} by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau and manufactured by the Tulamashzavod Joint Stock Company. The cannons are fired alternatively with a combined rate of fire of between 3,900 and 5,000 rounds per minute (1,950 to <b>2,500</b> <b>rpm</b> for each gun), and have a muzzle velocity of 960m/s. Bursts of between 83 and 250 rounds are fired {{as determined by the}} target type, with an engagement range between 0.2 and 4.0km and to an altitude of about 3km. HE-T and HE-I shells are used and fitted with a A-670 time and impact fuze which includes an arming delay and self destruct mechanism. Sources vary on elevation capabilities (one estimate gives +85 to −9 degrees, while another +87 to −10 degrees), though this range allows the system to engage ground as well as aerial targets. The 2K22 can fire its cannons in two primary modes of operation, radar and optical. In radar mode, the target tracking is fully automatic, with the guns aimed using data from the radar. In optical mode, the gunner tracks the target through the 1A29 stabilized sight, with the radar providing range data. The 2K22 is reported to have a kill probability of 0.8 with cannon. The height of defeat for guns is 0–2000 meters—for missiles 10–3500 meters.|$|E

5000|$|The Polen Special, (Also {{known as}} the Polen Special II) {{development}} started in October 1967 by Dennis Polen and Darryl Usher. The project to build a fast single seat racer larger than Formula One limitations began as a retractable gear Midget Mustang modification. After reviewing engine installation shortcomings, a clean sheet design was started. The Polen Special was then designed around a Piper Comanche engine and cowling, which also had design issues with engine canting and required cowling modifications for a single engine installation. A new clean sheet Lycoming IO-360 installation came afterward. Two sets of retractable landing gear were built and tested, but were sold to other homebuilders. Over time, the RayJay turbocharger was removed due to hunting and composite ailerons were installed. The aircraft was sold by Polen to Richard C. Keyt and has been modified several times to increase efficiency and safety. A composite rudder replaced the all-metal rudder that fluttered to destruction at <b>2500</b> engine <b>RPM</b> and a modern turbocharger was installed. Keyt and partner Jack Zimmanck formed the Polen Company to develop aircraft technologies with the Polen Special as a flying testbed.
