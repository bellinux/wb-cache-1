5000|$|... <b>2-Chloroethanol</b> is an {{chemical}} compound with the formula HOCH2CH2Cl and the simplest chlorohydrin. This colorless liquid has a pleasant ether-like odor. It is miscible with water. The molecule is bifunctional, consisting of both an alkyl chloride and an alcohol functional groups.|$|E

50|$|Mustard agent {{can have}} the effect of turning a patient's skin {{different}} colors, including reds, oranges, pinks, and in unusual cases, blues. The German Empire during World War I relied on the Meyer-Clarke method as <b>2-chloroethanol</b> was readily available from the German chemical dye industry of that time.|$|E
50|$|In {{regards to}} dermal {{exposure}} to <b>2-chloroethanol,</b> the Occupational Safety and Health Administration {{has set a}} permissible exposure limit of 5 ppm (16 mg/m3) over an eight-hour time-weighted average, while the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has a more protective recommended exposure limit of a 1 ppm (3 mg/m3) exposure ceiling.|$|E
50|$|In organic {{chemistry}} a halohydrin (also a haloalcohol or β-halo alcohol) is a functional group {{in which a}} halogen and a hydroxyl are bonded to adjacent carbon atoms, which otherwise bear only hydrogen or hydrocarbyl groups (e.g. <b>2-chloroethanol,</b> 3-chloropropane-1,2-diol). The term only applies to saturated motifs, as such compounds like 2-chlorophenol would not normally be considered halohydrins. Megatons of some chlorohydrins, e.g. propylene chlorohydrin, are produced annually as precursors to polymers.|$|E
50|$|As {{with any}} {{functional}} group, {{the hazards of}} halohydrins are difficult to generalize as they may form part of an almost limitless series of compounds, with each structure having different pharmacology. In general, simpler low molecular weight compounds are often toxic and carcinogenic (e.g. <b>2-chloroethanol,</b> 3-MCPD) {{by virtue of being}} alkylating agents. This reactivity can be put to good use, for instance in the anti-cancer drug mitobronitol. A number of synthetic corticosteroids exist baring a fluorohydrin motif (triamcinolone, dexamethasone).|$|E
50|$|Mustard {{agent was}} {{possibly}} developed {{as early as}} 1822 by César-Mansuète Despretz (1798-1863). Despretz described the reaction of sulfur dichloride and ethylene but never made mention of any irritating properties of the reaction product, which makes the claim doubtful. In 1854, another French chemist, Alfred Riche (1829-1908), repeated this procedure {{but he did not}} describe any adverse physiological properties. In 1860, the British scientist Frederick Guthrie synthesized and characterized the mustard agent compound, and he also noted its irritating properties, especially in tasting. In 1860, chemist Albert Niemann, known as a pioneer in cocaine chemistry, repeated the reaction, and recorded blister-forming properties. In 1886, Viktor Meyer published a paper describing a synthesis that produced good yields. He combined <b>2-chloroethanol</b> with aqueous potassium sulfide, and then treated the resulting thiodiglycol with phosphorus trichloride. The purity of this compound was much higher, and the adverse health effects on exposure much more severe. These symptoms presented themselves in his assistant, and in order to {{rule out the possibility that}} his assistant was suffering from a mental illness (psychosomatic symptoms), Meyer had this compound tested on laboratory rabbits, most of which died. In 1913, the English chemist Hans Thacher Clarke (known for the Eschweiler-Clarke reaction) replaced the phosphorus trichloride with hydrochloric acid in Meyer's formulation while working with Emil Fischer in Berlin. Clarke was hospitalized for two months for burns after one of his flasks broke. According to Meyer, Fischer's report on this accident to the German Chemical Society sent the German Empire on the road to chemical weapons.|$|E
