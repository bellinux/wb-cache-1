5000|$|... <b>2-Heptanone</b> {{has also}} {{been found to be}} {{excreted}} by honey bees when they bite small pests within the colony such as wax moth larvae and Varroa mites. Though it was historically believed to be an alarm pheromone, <b>2-heptanone</b> has been shown to act as an anaesthetic on the pests, enabling the honey bee to stun the pest and eject it from the hive. The work could lead to the use of <b>2-Heptanone</b> as an alternative local anaesthetic to lidocaine, which although well established for clinical use, has the disadvantage of provoking allergic reactions in some people.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of <b>2-heptanone</b> as a pheromone at odorant receptors in rodents has been investigated.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>2-Heptanone</b> {{was one of}} the {{metabolites}} of n-heptane {{found in}} the urine of employees exposed to heptane in shoe and tire factories.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>2-Heptanone,</b> {{also known}} as methyl n-amyl ketone, or Heptan-2-one, is a ketone with the {{molecular}} formula C7H14O. It is a colorless, water-white liquid with a banana-like, fruity odor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{distinctive}} {{flavor and}} aroma of blue cheese arises from methyl ketones (including 2-pentanone, <b>2-heptanone,</b> and 2-nonanone) {{which are a}} metabolic product of Penicillium roqueforti. [...] These compounds are not formed in other types of cheese fermented by bacterial acidification alone.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>2-Heptanone</b> {{is listed}} by the FDA as a [...] "food {{additive}} permitted for direct addition to food for human consumption" [...] (21 CFR 172.515), and it occurs naturally in certain foods (e.g., beer, white bread, butter, various cheeses and potato chips).|$|E
5000|$|Pheromone release devices [...] Multiple reservoir-type {{controlled}} release devices (CRDs) {{have been developed}} to achieve the {{controlled release}} of highly volatile pheromones into an agricultural setting; whereby they could act as pesticides throughout the growing season. There are several draw-backs associated with current CRDs because they involve multi-step preparation protocols, exhibit low pheromone-holding capacities, are not biodegradable, and exhibit leaking of the pheromones when compressed or broken. To address these functional issues a sugar alcohol-based amphiphilic super-gelator, mannitol dioctanoate (M8), has been developed that efficiently gelled the pheromones, <b>2-heptanone</b> and lauryl acetate. The miticide, <b>2-heptanone</b> controls the parasitic mite, varroa (Varroa destructor), that are responsible for honey bee (Apis mellifera L) colony destruction. [...] The researchers further developed the application of this supergelator by developing a reservoir-type CRD that consisted of the <b>2-heptanone</b> gel in a vapor-barrier-film sealed pouch which was then activated by boring a small hole through the vapor barrier. The CRD had a high loading capacity of 92% wt/wt allowing for the construction of small devices with a high biocompatibility and because, M8 is composed of mannitol and fatty acids it is also biodegradable.|$|E

50|$|Scaptotrigona postica workers leave scent paths {{between the}} nest and food sources, facilitating the {{successful}} foraging of others. The threshold distance from food to nest for the scent trail is 11 - 12 m, although the flight radius from the nest is larger (600 m). These marks last about 15 minutes before dissipating. Workers follow {{the tracks of}} other populations of the same species, increasing foraging success of both colonies. These scent substances are composed of two different ketones: <b>2-heptanone</b> and 2-nonanone.|$|E
