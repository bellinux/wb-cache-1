5|$|Fifteen {{of their}} 38 matches {{have been on}} clay which is {{statistically}} Nadal's best surface and Federer's worst, with 13 being in finals. Nadal has a winning record on outdoor hard courts (8–6) and clay (13–2), while Federer leads on grass (2–1) and indoor hard courts (5–1). Because tournament seedings are based on rankings, 24 of their matches have been in tournament finals which have included an all-time record 9 Grand Slam tournament finals. From 2006 to 2008 they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final. Nadal won six of the nine, losing the first two Wimbledon finals. Four of these finals were five set-matches (2007 and 2008 Wimbledon, 2009 and 2017 Australian Open), with the 2008 Wimbledon final being lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts. Thirteen of their 38 meetings have reached a deciding set. They have also played in 12 Masters Series finals, including their lone five-hour match at the 2006 Rome Masters which Nadal won in a fifth-set tie-break having saved two match points and at the 2005 Miami Masters where Federer came back from <b>2</b> <b>sets</b> down to win in nearly 4 hours. They also contested {{the final of the}} ATP World Tour Finals in 2010 with Federer winning in 3 sets. Nadal has defeated Federer on grass in Wimbledon (which is Federer's better surface) but Federer {{has not been able to}} beat Nadal on clay in Roland Garros losing to him several times.|$|E

40|$|DIGITS The {{full text}} of this article can be read via open access on the publisher's page. Type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> and complex fuzzy sets are both three {{dimensional}} extensions of type- 1 fuzzy sets. Complex fuzzy sets come in two forms, the standard form, postulated in 2002 by Ramot et al., and the 2011 innovation of pure complex fuzzy sets, proposed by Tamir et al [...] In this paper we compare and contrast both forms of complex fuzzy <b>set</b> with type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>sets,</b> as regards their rationales, applications, definitions, and structures. In addition, pure complex fuzzy sets are compared with type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> {{in relation to their}} inferencing operations. Complex fuzzy <b>sets</b> and type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> differ in their roles and applications; complex fuzzy sets are pertinent to inferencing where there is seasonality, and type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> are applicable to reasoning under uncertainty. Their definitions differ also, though there is equivalence between those of a pure complex fuzzy set and a type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>set.</b> Structural similarity is evident between these three- dimensional sets. Complex fuzzy sets are represented by a 3 –D line, and type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> by a 3 –D surface, but a surface is simply a generalisation of a line. This similarity is particularly apparent between pure complex fuzzy <b>sets</b> and type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>sets,</b> which are both mappings from the domain onto the unit square. However type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> were found not to be isomorphic to pure complex fuzzy sets. The mechanisms by which complex fuzzy sets model and quantify periodicity, and type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> model and quantify uncertainty are discussed. A type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>set</b> can be represented as the union of its type- <b>2</b> embedded <b>set.</b> An embedded type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>set</b> is a type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>set</b> in itself, whose geomet- rical representation is a 3 -D line. Thus, geometrically an embedded type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>set</b> can be seen as equivalent to a pure complex fuzzy set and therefore a type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>set</b> can be represented as the union of a collection pure complex fuzzy sets, which in turn can be regarded as embedded complex fuzzy sets of a type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>set.</b> This relationship is exploited to provide a complex definition of a type- <b>2</b> fuzzy <b>set...</b>|$|R
