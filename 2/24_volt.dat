25|$|Electrical power {{came from}} a <b>24</b> <b>volt</b> DC {{generator}} on the starboard (No. 2) engine and an alternator on the port engine, which supplied AC power for radios. The radiator shutters, supercharger gear change, gun camera, bomb bay, bomb/rocket release {{and all the other}} crew controlled instruments were powered by a <b>24</b> <b>volt</b> battery. The radio communication devices included VHF and HF communications, GEE navigation, and IFF and G.P. devices. The electric generators also powered the fire extinguishers. Located on the starboard side of the cockpit, the switches would operate automatically {{in the event of a}} crash. In flight, a warning light would flash to indicate a fire, should the pilot not already be aware of it. In later models, to save liquids and engine clean up time in case of belly landing, the fire extinguisher was changed to semi-automatic triggers.|$|E
25|$|The Mk 22 was {{identical}} to the Mk 21 in all respects except for the cut-back rear fuselage, with the tear-drop canopy, and a more powerful <b>24</b> <b>volt</b> electrical system {{in place of the}} 12 volt system of all earlier Spitfires. Most of the Mk 22s were built with enlarged tail surfaces, {{similar to those of the}} Supermarine Spiteful. A total of 287 Mk 22s were built: 260 at Castle Bromwich and 27 by Supermarine at South Marston.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, Chevrolet started {{building}} {{a new generation of}} CUCV. The US Air Force initially bought small batches of these units, dubbed the CUCV II. Produced through 2001, CUCV IIs were basic civilian Chevrolet C/K, Tahoe, and Suburban units sent to another plant for [...] "militarization" [...] on special order. The trucks were originally white in color with gray vinyl interiors. They received CARC exterior paint (Forest Green, Desert Sand, or 3-color camouflage), a brush bar, a pintle hitch, towing/loading shackles, extra leaf springs to give them a 5/4 ton rating {{and a host of other}} small changes. All CUCV IIs have a <b>24</b> <b>volt</b> dual-battery starting system, the rest of the truck is 12 volt.|$|E
2500|$|Electromechanical {{thermostats}} use resistance {{elements as}} anticipators. Most electronic thermostats use either thermistor devices or integrated logic elements for the anticipation function. [...] In some electronic thermostats, the thermistor anticipator may be located outdoors, providing a variable anticipation {{depending on the}} outdoor temperature. Thermostat enhancements include outdoor temperature display, programmability, and system fault indication. While such <b>24</b> <b>volt</b> thermostats are incapable of operating a furnace when the mains power fails, most such furnaces require mains power for heated air fans (and often also hot-surface or electronic spark ignition) rendering moot the functionality of the thermostat. In other circumstances such as piloted wall and [...] "gravity" [...] (fanless) floor and central heaters the low voltage system described previously may be capable of remaining functional when electrical power is unavailable.|$|E
2500|$|Newer digital {{thermostats}} have no {{moving parts}} to measure temperature and instead rely on thermistors or {{other semiconductor devices}} such as a resistance thermometer (resistance temperature detector). Typically one or more regular batteries must be installed to operate it, although some so-called [...] "power stealing" [...] digital thermostats use the common <b>24</b> <b>volt</b> AC circuits as a power source, but will not operate on thermopile powered [...] "millivolt" [...] circuits used in some furnaces. [...] Each has an LCD screen showing the current temperature, and the current setting.

2500|$|Depending on what {{is being}} controlled, a forced-air air {{conditioning}} thermostat generally has an external switch for heat/off/cool, and another on/auto to turn the blower fan on constantly or only when heating and cooling are running. [...] Four wires come to the centrally-located thermostat from the main heating/cooling unit (usually located in a closet, basement, or occasionally in the attic): One wire, usually red, supplies 24 volts AC power to the thermostat, while the other three supply control signals from the thermostat, usually white for heat, yellow for cooling, and green {{to turn on the}} blower fan. [...] The power is supplied by a transformer, and when the thermostat makes contact between the <b>24</b> <b>volt</b> power and {{one or two of the}} other wires, a relay back at the heating/cooling unit activates the corresponding heat/fan/cool function of the unit(s).|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of modern heating/cooling/heat pump thermostats operate on low voltage (typically 24 volts AC) control circuits. The {{source of the}} <b>24</b> <b>volt</b> AC power is a control transformer installed {{as part of the}} heating/cooling equipment. The advantage of the low voltage control system is the ability to operate multiple electromechanical switching devices such as relays, contactors, and sequencers using inherently safe voltage and current levels. Built into the thermostat is a provision for enhanced temperature control using anticipation. [...] A heat anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the heating appliance is operating. [...] This opens the heating contacts slightly early to prevent the space temperature from greatly overshooting the thermostat setting. [...] A mechanical heat anticipator is generally adjustable and should be set to the current flowing in the heating control circuit when the system is operating. A cooling anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the cooling appliance is not operating. This causes the contacts to energize the cooling equipment slightly early, preventing the space temperature from climbing excessively. Cooling anticipators are generally non-adjustable.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Dodge began {{developing}} militarized {{adaptations of}} their current civilian trucks. In 1976, the M880/M890 series was put into production under a large contract., For almost a decade the Dodges were referred to as [...] "880s", [...] "890s", or most commonly called [...] "five-quarters". The term [...] "CUCV" [...] did not appear until the 1980s when GM was contracted to replace the M880/90s. The M8XXs were {{an attempt by the}} U.S. military to use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) vehicles with minor modifications in non-combat roles. They were intended to replace the M37, M715 and their related variants. The 1¼ ton M880-series was based on the Dodge W200, a ¾ ton capacity 4×4 civilian/commercial truck. The 880/90s had a 2500 lb cargo rating, enabling it to have a -ton load rating. The similar 1¼ ton M890-series was based on the Dodge D200, a ¾ ton capacity 4×2 civilian/commercial truck. The M880/M890s had several failings: a gasoline powerplant, 12-volt electrical systems (a separate <b>24</b> <b>volt</b> system was added to communications units), and no power steering, due to the PS pump location being used for the 24V generator. The 318 gasoline engine proved to be a fatal flaw as the military moved increasingly to diesel engines during this time period. The lack of power steering was a hindrance in off-road, close quarters, and snow-plowing duties (although most civilian and Air Force models had power steering). Around 44,000 M880/M890s were produced during the 1976–1977 model years and faithfully served the Army and Air Force until the late 1990s.|$|E

2500|$|Power {{is always}} {{required}} {{to establish an}} outgoing wormhole, and is usually supplied by the DHD, but any Stargate can receive a wormhole whether it has a power supply or not; either gate may supply the power once a wormhole has been established. In a few cases, Stargates have been dialed [...] "manually" [...] when more sophisticated means were not available. This was accomplished by providing sufficient raw power to the gate and then rotating the symbol ring by hand to encode each chevron. Power can be fed directly into the Naquadah that composes the gate; power harnessed from lightning strikes {{has been shown to}} be sufficient, as has the energy from the core of a naquadah bomb., however the minimum requirement for a stable wormhole appears to be a 12 or <b>24</b> <b>volt</b> current (depending on wiring) as shown in the episode [...] "1969" [...] where the team powers the gate using jumper cables hooked up to two military transport trucks. The Stargate that establishes an outgoing wormhole determines how long the wormhole is held open, and can generally close the wormhole at will. Under some conditions, a gate only needs enough power to connect briefly, then the receiving gate can provide enough power to maintain the connection. The same is true if the outgoing gate loses power while transmitting; if the incoming gate has a DHD, it will take over powering the gate until reintegration is complete. The System Lord Anubis possessed an Ancient weapon that would channel energy into a receiving Stargate through an open dialed gate; prolonged use of this weapon would cause the gate's Naquadah to continue to absorb the energy until a significant explosion would take place.|$|E
