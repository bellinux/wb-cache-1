5000|$|... <b>2-Ethylhexyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> is {{together}} with butyl acrylate {{one of the}} major base monomers for the preparation of acrylate adhesives. <b>2-Ethylhexyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> can be react by free-radical polymerization to macromolecules having a molecular weight of up to 200,000 g/mol. Other monomers such as vinyl acetate, methyl acrylate, styrene or molecules having functional groups may be copolymerized to modify the properties of the resulting polymer.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>2-Ethylhexyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> {{chemical}} compound which {{belongs to the}} acrylates. It is a colorless liquid with a sweet odour.|$|E
50|$|The racemic <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> can be {{prepared}} with a high yield by esterification of acrylic acid with racemic 2-ethylhexanol {{in the presence of}} hydroquinone as a polymerization inhibitor and a strong acid such as methanesulfonic acid by reactive distillation using toluene as azeotroping agent.|$|E
50|$|Acrylic acid {{undergoes}} {{the typical}} reactions of a carboxylic acid. When reacted with an alcohol, it forms the corresponding ester. The esters and salts of acrylic acid are collectively known as acrylates (or propenoates). The most common alkyl {{esters of acrylic acid}} are methyl, butyl, ethyl, and <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> <b>acrylate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... <b>2-Ethylhexyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> does {{polymerize}} easily. The polymerization can {{be initiated}} by light, peroxides, heat or even contaminates. It can react violently {{when combined with}} strong oxidants and can form explosive mixtures with air at temperatures above 82 C. The chemical, physical and toxicological properties, however, can be greatly modified by additives or stabilizers.|$|E
50|$|Ethyl {{acrylate}} is a reactant for homologous alkyl acrylates (acrylic esters) by transesterification {{with higher}} alcohols through acidic or basic catalysis. In that way speciality acrylates are made accessible, e.g. <b>2-ethylhexyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> (from 2-ethylhexanol) used for pressure-sensitive adhesives, cyclohexyl acrylate (from cyclohexanol) used for automotive clear lacquers, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (from ethylene glycol) which is crosslinkable with diisocyanates to form gels used with long-chain acrylates (from C18+ alcohols) as comonomer for comb polymers for {{reduction of the}} solidification point of paraffin oils and 2-dimethylaminoethyl acrylate (from dimethylaminoethanol) for the preparation of flocculants for sewage clarification and paper production.|$|E
