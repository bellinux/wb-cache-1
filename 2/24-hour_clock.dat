500|$|Chulip {{received}} mostly average critical scores {{upon its}} release in North America. The game currently holds a 57% on the aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic. The ambitious gameplay of Chulip {{has been almost}} universally criticized. Ray Barnholt of 1UP.com, Ryan Davis of GameSpot, Micah Seff of IGN, and Gus Mastrapa of X-Play all labeled the often-unclear progression presented to the player as [...] "frustrating" [...] and [...] "tedious", requiring an excessive amount of patience. Mastrapa summarized, [...] "Since the game is on <b>24-hour</b> <b>clock</b> a missed opportunity means having {{to wait until the}} next day to take another crack. Add the fact that your inexperienced, young avatar can die from heartbreak, resulting in a 'game over' screen and the loss of unsaved progress and you've got a recipe for annoyance." [...] Barnholt, Davis, and Seff did positively credit Natsume for the inclusion of the mini-strategy guide. Despite faulting the [...] "indistinct objectives", Davis found gratification in successful kisses. [...] "The whole kissing thing is absolutely fantastic in concept," [...] Davis stated, [...] "And there's something unsettling about your character's encouraged promiscuity." [...] However, Game Informer writer Ben Reeves described the game {{as one of the most}} poorly designed games he has ever played due to its lack of in-game direction and frequency of game overs. In January 2008, Game Informer listed Chulip one of the worst games of 2007.|$|E

[...] To make a striking clock that told Japanese time, clockmakers used a system that ran two balances, one slow and one fast.

50|$|The first {{mechanical}} public clocks {{introduced in}} Italy were mechanical <b>24-hour</b> <b>clocks</b> which counted the 24 {{hours of the}} day from one half hour after sundown to the evening of the following day. The 24th hour was the last hour of day time. However, striking clocks had to produce 300 strokes each day which required a lot of rope, and wore out the mechanism quickly, so some localities switched to ringing sequences of 1 to 12 twice (156 strokes), or even 1 to 6 repeated 4 times (84 strokes).|$|R
50|$|Studies in cyanobacteria, however, {{changed our}} view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could {{maintain}} accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms. Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., {{in the absence of any}} cell components), proving that accurate <b>24-hour</b> <b>clocks</b> can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits. However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.|$|R

Minutes are always either [...] ('after') or [...] ('to') the hour, for example 21:18 [...] (eighteen (minutes) past nine) and 21:42 [...] ('eighteen (minutes) to ten'). Phrases such as [...] ('(of) the morning'), [...] ('(of) the afternoon') and [...] ('(of) the evening') are used to distinguish times in 12-hour notation, much like Latin am and pm, which are also in common use, for example [...] (09:00) as opposed to [...] (21:00).|$|R
