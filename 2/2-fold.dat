5|$|Suicidal {{thoughts}} and behaviors are rare in clinical trials, and the FDA requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, {{to carry a}} boxed warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a <b>2-fold</b> increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. For this analysis the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants in order to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion was not statistically different from placebo.|$|E
5|$|Any {{triangle}} or quadrilateral (even non-convex) {{can be used}} as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, {{often in}} more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary quadrilateral can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and <b>2-fold</b> rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a parallelogram subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.|$|E

Pulmonary arterial cell cultures treated with fasudil showed a significant increase in eNOS mRNA levels in a dose dependent manner, and the half-life of eNOS mRNA increased <b>2-folds.</b> These findings suggested that ROCK inhibition with fasudil increases eNOS expression by stabilizing eNOS mRNA, which contributed to an increase of NO level to enhance vasodilation.|$|R
50|$|The drug {{works by}} {{inhibiting}} {{the action of}} cyclooxygenase (COX) that {{is involved in the}} production of prostaglandins (PG) which is accountable for pain, swelling, inflammation and fever. The incidence of gastric ulcerogenicity of aceclofenac has been reported to be significantly lower than that of the other frequently prescribed NSAIDs, for instance, <b>2-folds</b> lesser than naproxen, 4-folds lesser than diclofenac, and 7-folds lesser than indomethacin. Aceclofenac (C16H13Cl2NO4), chemically 6-dichlorophenyl) amino} phenylacetooxyacetic acid, is a crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 354.19. It is practically insoluble in water with good permeability. It is metabolized in human hepatocytes and human microsomes to form phenylamino) phenyl acetoxyacetic acid as the major metabolite, which is then further conjugated. According to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) drug substances are classified to four classes upon their solubility and permeability. Aceclofenac falls under the BCS Class II, poorly soluble and highly permeable drug.|$|R

During overexpression of Spot 42 sixteen different genes show <b>2-fold</b> elevated levels of mRNA. The identified genes are mostly involved in central and secondary metabolism, as well as uptake and catabolism of non-preferred carbon sources and oxidation of NADH.|$|E
25|$|Using a lattice basis, neither {{orthogonality}} nor unit {{length is}} guaranteed, only independence. However, the trace {{is the same}} with respect to any basis. (Trace is a similarity invariant.) In a lattice basis, because the rotation must map lattice points to lattice points, each matrix entry — and hence the trace — must be an integer. Thus, for example, wallpaper and crystals cannot have 8-fold rotational symmetry. The only possibilities are multiples of 60°, 90°, 120°, and 180°, corresponding to 6-, 4-, 3-, and <b>2-fold</b> rotations.|$|E
25|$|A (simply-laced) Dynkin diagram (finite or affine) {{that has}} a {{symmetry}} (satisfying one condition, below) can be quotiented by the symmetry, yielding a new, generally multiply laced diagram, with the process called folding (due to most symmetries being <b>2-fold).</b> At the level of Lie algebras, this corresponds to taking the invariant subalgebra under the outer automorphism group, and the process can be defined purely with reference to root systems, without using diagrams. Further, every multiply laced diagram (finite or infinite) {{can be obtained by}} folding a simply-laced diagram.|$|E
25|$|A {{few of the}} {{metabolites}} of oxycodone {{have also}} {{been found to be}} active as MOR agonists, some of which notably have much higher affinity for (as well as higher efficacy at) the MOR in comparison. Oxymorphone possesses 3- to 5-fold higher affinity for the MOR than does oxycodone, while noroxycodone and noroxymorphone possess one-third of and 3-fold higher affinity for the MOR, respectively, and MOR activation is 5- to 10-fold less with noroxycodone but <b>2-fold</b> higher with noroxymorphone relative to oxycodone. Noroxycodone, noroxymorphone, and oxymorphone also have longer half-lives than oxycodone.|$|E
25|$|Pure AR antagonists like {{flutamide}} and bicalutamide are potent progonadotropins with indirect estrogenic {{activity in}} males. This {{is because they}} block the AR in the pituitary gland and hypothalamus and thereby inhibit the negative feedback of androgens on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. This, in turn, results in increased gonadotropin secretion, activation of gonadal steroidogenesis, and an up to <b>2-fold</b> increase in testosterone levels and 2.5-fold increase in estradiol levels. Conversely, AR antagonists that are also progestogens, like cyproterone acetate, are not progonadotropic, as activation of the PR is antigonadotropic, and, indeed, cyproterone acetate is potently antigonadotropic in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|For bicalutamide, the antiandrogenic {{activities}} of sulfide and sulfone substitions of the X-linkage {{were tested in}} vitro. The sulfides showed in most cases at least <b>2-fold</b> higher binding affinity than corresponding sulfones. However, this relationship was reversed when the R3 group was NHSO2CH3, where the binding affinity of sulfone was 3-fold {{higher than that of}} sulfide. These results indicate that substituents of the B-ring largely determine the effect of the X-linkage in AR binding. Researchers have proposed that the tertiary hydroxyl group is involved in direct interaction with AR because when an acetyl group is introduced to that hydroxyl moiety, the receptor binding affinity greatly decreases.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of {{the average}} number of unique {{messenger}} RNAs that are targets for repression by a typical miRNA vary, depending on the estimation method, but multiple approaches show that mammalian miRNAs can have many unique targets. For example, an analysis of the miRNAs highly conserved in vertebrates shows that each has, on average, roughly 400 conserved targets. Likewise, experiments show that a single miRNA species can reduce the stability of hundreds of unique messenger RNAs. Other experiments show that a single miRNA species may repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression often is relatively mild (much less than <b>2-fold).</b> The first human disease associated with deregulation of miRNAs was chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Other B cell malignancies followed.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 the FDA {{required}} all antidepressants {{to carry}} a black box warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in people younger than 25. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts that found a <b>2-fold</b> increase of the suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase of suicidality in the 18–24 age group. The suicidality was slightly decreased for those older than 24, and statistically significantly lower in the 65 and older group. This analysis was criticized by Donald Klein, who noted that suicidality, that is suicidal ideation and behavior, is not necessarily a good surrogate marker for completed suicide, and it is still possible that antidepressants may prevent actual suicide while increasing suicidality.|$|E
25|$|The {{volume of}} SDN in medial preoptic area is {{modified}} by hormones, among which testosterone is {{proved to be}} of much importance. The larger volume of male SDN is correlated to the higher concentration of fetal testosterone level in males than in females. Also, {{there is evidence that}} testosterone acts during specific prenatal period to organize the development of aromatase-expressing neurons into the male-typical SDN (testosterone is transformed to estrogen by aromatase). The effect of testosterone is also reflected by the influence of fetal intrauterine position on the morphology of SDN-POA. Studies demonstrated that male rats which were gestated between two male fetuses (2M) have <b>2-fold</b> larger SDN-POA volumes than those gestated between two female fetuses (2F). At the same time, the testosterone levels, as well as the 17β-estradiol (product of testosterone) levels, were found to be significantly larger in 2M males than in 2F males on gestation day 21 (testosterone can be transferred from adjacent male fetuses to the target rats). However, evidence fails to show any relationship between SDN volume and female fetal position.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the real}} numbers (if the {{coefficients}} must be real), {{there are no}} non-hyperbolic loxodromic transformations, and the classification is into elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic, as for real conics. The terminology is due to considering half the absolute value of the trace, |tr|/2, as the eccentricity of the transformation– division by 2 corrects for the dimension, so the identity has eccentricity 1 (tr/n is sometimes used as an alternative for the trace for this reason), and absolute value corrects for the trace only being defined up to a factor of ±1 due to working in PSL. Alternatively one may use half the trace squared {{as a proxy for}} the eccentricity squared, as was done above; these classifications (but not the exact eccentricity values, since squaring and absolute values are different) agree for real traces but not complex traces. The same terminology is used for the classification of elements of SL(2, R) (the <b>2-fold</b> cover), and analogous classifications are used elsewhere. Loxodromic transformations are an essentially complex phenomenon, and correspond to complex eccentricities.|$|E
25|$|A study {{assessed}} the metabolism {{of a single}} 75mg oral dose of doxepin in healthy volunteers with genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 enzymes. In CYP2D6 extensive, intermediate, and poor metabolizers, the mean clearance rates of (E)-doxepin were 406, 247, and 127L/hour, respectively (~3-fold difference between extensive and poor). In addition, the bioavailability of (E)-doxepin was about <b>2-fold</b> lower in extensive relative to poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, indicating a significant role of CYP2D6 in the first-pass metabolism of (E)-doxepin. The clearance of (E)-doxepin in CYP2C9 slow metabolizers was also significantly reduced at 238L/hour. CYP2C19 {{was involved in the}} metabolism of (Z)-doxepin, with clearance rates of 191L/hour in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers and 73L/hour in poor metabolizers (~2.5-fold difference). Area-under-the-curve (0–48hour) levels of nordoxepin were dependent on the genotype of CYP2D6 with median values of 1.28, 1.35, and 5.28nM•L/hour in CYP2D6 extensive, intermediate, and poor metabolizers, respectively (~4-fold difference between extensive and poor). Taken together, doxepin metabolism appears to be highly stereoselective, and CYP2D6 genotype has a major influence on the pharmacokinetics of (E)-doxepin. Moreover, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as well as patients taking potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (which can potentially convert a CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer into a poor metabolizer), may be at an increased risk for adverse effects of doxepin due to their slower clearance of the drug.|$|E
25|$|Stressful working {{conditions}} {{can lead to}} three types of strains: Behavioral (e.g., absenteeism or poor performance), physical (e.g., headaches or coronary heart disease), and psychological (e.g., anxiety or depressed mood). Physical symptoms that may occur because of occupational stress include fatigue, headache, upset stomach, muscular aches and pains, weight gain or loss, chronic mild illness, and sleep disturbances. Psychological and behavioral problems that may develop include anxiety, irritability, alcohol and drug use, feeling powerless and low morale. The spectrum of effects caused by occupational stress includes absenteeism, poor decision making, lack of creativity, accidents, organizational breakdown or even sabotage. If exposure to stressors in the workplace is prolonged, then chronic health problems can occur including stroke. An examination was of physical and psychological effects of workplace stress was conducted {{with a sample of}} 552 female blue collar employees of a microelectronics facility. It was found that job-related conflicts were associated with depressive symptoms, severe headaches, fatigue, rashes, and other multiple symptoms. Studies among the Japanese population specifically showed a more than <b>2-fold</b> increase in the risk of total stroke among men with job strain (combination of high job demand and low job control). Those in blue-collar or manual labor jobs are more likely to develop heart disease compared to those in white-collar jobs. Along with the risk of stroke, stress can raise the risk of high blood pressure, immune system dysfunction, coronary artery disease. Prolonged occupational stress can lead to occupational burnout. Occupational stress can also disrupt relationships.|$|E
