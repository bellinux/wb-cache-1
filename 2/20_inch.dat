2500|$|During World War II, Stevens began {{producing}} {{both the}} Model 520A (renamed the Model 520-30) and the Model 620A (labeled as the Model 620) as trench guns, riot guns, and long-barreled training guns for the US military. [...] Trench guns were produced with <b>20</b> <b>inch</b> barrels (cylinder bore) {{and had a}} heat shield with a unique pinkish anodized bayonet lug attached {{to the front of}} the barrel (late war examples had a small [...] "S" [...] stamped on the left side). [...] The receivers of both models were stamped on the left side (from front to back) with a small [...] "P" [...] and ordnance bomb, [...] "Model 520-30" [...] or [...] "Model 620", and a small [...] "U.S." [...] over the trigger. [...] Model 520-30 trench gun barrels are marked [...] "Proof Tested--12 Gauge --2 3/4 Inch Chamber--" [...] on the left side and have another small [...] "P" [...] and ordnance bomb and the [...] "J Stevens Arms Company" [...] address on the right side of the barrel. [...] This was done so that all the markings could be read with the heat shield installed. [...] Some Model 620 trench gun barrels were marked in the same manner as the Model 520-30 trench guns and some had all the barrel markings on the left side. [...] Trench guns were also fitted with a sling swivel in the stock. [...] Riot guns also had <b>20</b> <b>inch</b> barrels (cylinder bore) and had all the same martial markings, except that all the barrel markings were on the left side. [...] The long barreled training guns were marked in the same manner as riot guns and were mainly used for aerial gunnery training. [...] Total wartime production of all Model 520-30 shotguns was 33,306 and all Model 620 shotguns was 12,174. [...] After the war the US military standardized both the Model 520-30 and the Model 620 and kept them in the inventory. [...] They were used in the Korean War and as late as the Vietnam War.|$|E
