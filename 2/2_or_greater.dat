METHODS: Our medical team equipped a mobile health unit, called Vehicle Assisted Nutrition (VAN), with {{educational material}} and drove it to seven recreation sites in the Bronx. At these sites, participants completed a short survey, and our staff took body mass index (BMI) measurements. The medical team also distributed patient education materials pertaining to lifestyle modification and obesity. BMI and survey responses were compared and analyzed with statistical software. RESULTS: Obesity rates at these sites averaged 29. 9 % normal weight, 40. 2 % overweight, 18 % class- 1 obese and 11 % class- <b>2</b> obese <b>or</b> <b>greater.</b> Only 22. <b>2</b> % of normal weight, 23. 3 % of overweight and 43. 6 % of class- 1 obese respondents stated that their weight was a problem (p< 0. 001). Most (80. 6 %) of the class- <b>2</b> obese <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> respondents, however, stated that their weight was a problem (p< 0. 001). More than 44 % of normal weight, 59. 4 % of overweight, 71. 3 of class- 1 obese and 90. 3 % of the class- <b>2</b> obese <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> participants stated {{they were willing to}} do something about it (p= 0. 006). Of those surveyed, 37. 5 % of the normal weight, 54. 7 % of the overweight, 56. 9 % of the class- 1 obese and 63. 6 % of the class- <b>2</b> obese <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> indicated that they would like our help (p= 0. 035).

The functional effect of filling was dramatic: using {{an index of}} ischemia (based on the percent of hypocontractile perimeter of myocardium, sum of ST segment elevation, and time of onset of angina), Cohen found that grade 0 or 1 filling confers only nominal protection from ischemia (i.e., filling is non-existent or of side branches only), but partial filling (i.e. grade <b>2</b> <b>or</b> <b>greater)</b> of these segments provides almost complete preservation of the affected myocardium from the asynergy associated with critical coronary stenosis.

To determine what label participants used to identify their sexual orientation, participants were asked, [...] "How would you classify your sexual orientation?"

People who selected [...] "heterosexual" [...] were place in the heterosexual group, whereas people selecting [...] "gay/lesbian" [...] were placed in the non-heterosexual group. To assess sexual attraction, participants were asked, [...] "How sexually attracted are you to men?" [...] and selected from a 7 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Participants were also asked [...] "How sexually attracted are you to women?" [...] and were presented with the same Likert scale.
