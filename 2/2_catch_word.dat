40|$|Aithough 'globalhsation {{has become}} the <b>catch</b> <b>word</b> of our times. {{it is not a}} simpDle iknear or uniform process. On the contrary, globali-sation is {{associated}} with apparently contradictory processes that manifest themselves in different forms in var. ous domains such as the economic, social, cultural and political domains. Furthermore, in all these domains, globalisation is not only characterised by uni-versalisation, homogenisation and uniformity but also by loca'isa-tion, heterogeneity and an emphasis on uniqueness. These many faces of globalisation are discussed in this article. ...|$|R

An Erdling group led by Axon Befal has sworn vengeance against the Geets-kel for imprisoning the Erdlings and attacks an Ol-zhaan, violence unheard of in Kindar society.|$|R
40|$|IT or the Computing & Communications {{technology}} has been central to the economic discussion for several decades. Before the mid- 1990 s the <b>catch</b> <b>word</b> was the “productivity paradox ” coined by Robert Solow, who stated in 1987 that “computers are everywhere visible, except in the productivity statistics”. The New Economy, suddenly became the <b>catch</b> <b>word</b> of the very late 1990 s. Its luster however, faded almost {{as fast as it}} arrived with the dot. com deaths of {{the first years of the}} new millennium. With this paper we demonstrate that the two paradoxes above are perfectly compatible within a consistent micro based macro theoretical framework of endogenous growth. Within the same model framework also a third paradox can be resolved, namely the fact that the previous major New Industry creation, the Industrial Revolution, only involved a handful of Western nations that had got their institutions in order. If the New Economy is a potential reality, one cannot take for granted that all industrial economies will participate successfully in its introduction. It all depends on the local receiver competence to build industry on the new technology. We, hence, also demonstrate the existence of the possibility of failing to capture the opportunities of a New Economy within the same model...|$|R
