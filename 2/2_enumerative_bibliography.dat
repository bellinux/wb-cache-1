50|$|<b>Enumerative</b> <b>bibliographies</b> {{are based}} on a unifying {{principle}} such as creator, subject, date, topic or other characteristic. An entry in an <b>enumerative</b> <b>bibliography</b> provides the core elements of a text resource including a title, the creator(s), publication date and place of publication. Belanger (1977) distinguishes an <b>enumerative</b> <b>bibliography</b> from other bibliographic forms such as descriptive bibliography, analytical bibliography or textual bibliography in that its function is to record and list, rather than describe a source in detail or with any reference to the source's physical nature, materiality or textual transmission. The enumerative list may be comprehensive or selective. One noted example would be Tanselle's bibliography that exhaustively enumerates topics and sources related to all forms of bibliography. A more common and particular instance of an <b>enumerative</b> <b>bibliography</b> relates to specific sources used or considered in preparing a scholarly paper or academic term paper.|$|R

50|$|Bowers (1949) {{refers to}} <b>enumerative</b> <b>bibliography</b> as a {{procedure}} that identifies books in “specific collections or libraries,” in a specific discipline, by an author, printer, or period of production (3). He refers to descriptive bibliography as the systematic description of a book as a material or physical artifact. Analytical bibliography, the cornerstone of descriptive bibliography, investigates the printing and all physical features of a book that yield evidence establishing a book's history and transmission (Feather 10). It is the preliminary phase of bibliographic description and provides the vocabulary, principles and techniques of analysis that descriptive bibliographers apply and on which they base their descriptive practice.|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} {{various aspects of}} the translation of children's literature from English into Czech, focusing on its earliest stages. The methodology of the research is based on the polysystem theory. It indicates - in agreement with the hypotheses of the theory - that the polysystem of Czech children's literature developed under a strong influence of translation. In the earliest stages, original English texts played a marginal role; they were mostly translated into Czech indirectly via German mediating texts. With the commencement of direct translation {{at the turn of the}} 19 th and the 20 th centuries, the influence of literary models of English origin became stronger; they enriched Czech children's literature by specific thematic genres, as well as new stimuli of the new conception of imaginative children's literature, which replaced older didactically oriented texts rooted in the tradition of philanthropism. The dissertation also examines bibliographic issues of the analyzed subsystem. It illustrates by examples how the customary <b>enumerative</b> <b>bibliography</b> can be extended to the sphere of textology and yield new findings concerning translated texts (e. g. the identification of the mediating text or the correct form of the translation).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to establish}} a definitive <b>enumerative</b> <b>bibliography</b> of the poetry, fiction and literary criticism of Thomas Love Peacock; to establish an annotated <b>enumerative</b> <b>bibliography</b> of the criticism of Peacock which is as complete as possible through June, 1958; to determine the successive critical attitudes toward the works of Peacock from February, 1800, to June, 1958; and to identify the major critical articles and books so that later scholars of Peacock may be sure of not overlooking any important items. The need for this study is evident when one knows that all existing Peacock bibliographies are unsatisfactory. The most scholarly as well as the most widely used are deficient. The Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (including the 1957 supplement) lists three translations of Maid Marian, but omits both the French and German translations of the more important novel Nightmare Abbey. The standard A Literary History of England, edited by A. C. Baugh, is obsolete in listing, as a convenient gdition of the novels, an unannotated two-volume edition of 1905, long unavailable; the appearance of the History in 1948 precluded listing the excellently annotated onevolume 1948 edition of Peacock. If the scholarly works are deficient, the more popular reference books are often downright wrong. The Encyclopaedia Britannica (editions of 1956, 1957, and 1958) prints "A. B. Joungn for "A. B. Young," choosing the least valuable (indeed. ~ positively the worst) of the seven available critical-biographies. Concerning the quality of the critical studies one may say that the works by A. B. Young (the oldest book on Peacock) and that by 0. W. Campbell (the most recent) should both be dismissed as being of very little value. The most extensive critical study is that by Jean-Jacques Mayoux, although this work is marred by an extremely unreliable bibliography. The most incisive critical studies are those by Augustus H. Able III and Jack Barry Ludwig, the latter being an unpublished dissertation. The best critical biographies are those by Carl Van Doren, Alexander Freeman, J. B. Priestley, and Benvenuto Cellini. Of these Van Doren is best in his biography, Freeman in relating Peacock to his contemporaries, and Priestlgy in his original critical insights. Cellini supplies nothing new except his emphasis on the ironic intent of Peacock. The only satisfactory source for a complete biography is the work of H. F. B. Brett-Smith, although this is written in a disagreeably dry style and omits all discussion of the intellectual milieu. The above-mentioned biographies by Van Doren and Priestley are good but both have been rendered obsolete in certain details by the work of Brett-Smith. Peacock has not been the subject of many first-rate articles. For the negative view, the most interesting is that by Ronald Mason. For a positive view, the best articles are those by James Spedding, George Saintsbury, Clive Bell, and Edmund Wilson. The best edition of the complete works, as is well known, is the Halliford Edition edited by H. F. B. Brett Smith and C. E. Jones, a limited edition now long out of print. The best annotated edition of the novels is that prepared by David Garnett. [TRUNCATED...|$|R
40|$|Very broadly speaking, {{bibliography}} {{involves the}} description of documents according to {{a particular set of}} rules, for a particular purpose. <b>Enumerative</b> <b>bibliography</b> typically aims to list some or all of a set of sources brought together because they belong to the same collection, were written by the same person, or were cited as references in the same publication. Analytical bibliography, or descriptive and historical bibliography typically aims to document the book per se in terms of both its physical nature and the historical context of printing, publishing, and bookselling in which it was produced. Bibliography in OED. As practised in house, bibliography appears to offer a stereotype of the enumerative, resulting in citations in the Dictionary text (providing a bibliographical reference for the particular part of the work that OED has used), and bibliographical records (providing library catalogue-type details of works quoted in OED). Citations created by the earlier editors of the Dictionary had to extend well beyond references to the canon of books and journals one might expect. Today's citations need to embrace a plethora of searchable digitized texts and genres of which the John Johnson Collection of printed ephemera is a prime example. Bibliographical records held in OED's database stores essential descriptive and historical information about quoted sources, including links to digitized texts and online reference material. In order to validate the evidence underpinning OED's definitions, present it clearly, and even on occasion to provide some lexicographical information, both enumerative and analytical techniques must be combined to generate an accurate and comprehensive one-line reference for the Dictionary's readers.

40|$|Bibliographically, {{document}} serials, do {{not differ}} substantially from other serials. Their acquisition is largely dependent upon the use of <b>enumerative</b> <b>bibliographies</b> which identify them; their use, upon the subject bibliographies which give some measure of control over their contents. Based on local requirements, every library has its own problems to consider storage, convenient availability, paper quality but bibliographic access is the common need that they all share. If libraries {{are willing to accept}} Osborn's definition that "on practical grounds a serial can be defined as any item which lends itself to serial treatment in a library," 1 then a great bulk of government document publication falls into the province of this conference. One reasonable estimate, based on a university library's receipts of documents, is that " 80 percent of the material published by the United States government is serial in nature. " 2 It is safe to assume that a comparable percentage pertains in most large libraries for state and foreign government acquisition. While today there are many bibliographic aids for serials and for documents that were not available a few years ago, the acquisition librarian's and the serial records librarian's approach to document serials whether for serial titles or for individual issues is often far from direct or automatic. Librarians are fortunate to have New Serial Titles from 1950, which gives far better coverage of state, federal, and foreign documents than the Union List Serials did, but as with any cooperative compilation, librarians must be grateful for what they find, and philosophic about what they do not find. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{students}} 2 ̆ 7 understanding of argumentation when talk and writing were provided as learning tools, as well as to explore how talk and writing can best support students 2 ̆ 7 construction of scientific knowledge. Most current studies have examined discourse patterns over a short interval of only a few class periods or compared only the students 2 ̆ 7 initial and final products to assess the quality of their argument structure. Few studies have examined how students develop their understanding of argumentation over time and how their understanding might result in overcoming those challenges. Moreover, talk and writing have been offered as two critical learning tools to support students 2 ̆ 7 argumentative practice. So far, few studies have explored how those two learning tools could be combined to better support students in constructing scientific knowledge. The research questions that guided this study were: (1) How do students develop an understanding of the components of argumentation for public negotiations over time when participating in an argument-based inquiry classroom? (2) In what ways do talk and writing support scientific knowledge construction in an argument-based inquiry classroom? This sixteen-week study was grounded in interactive constructivism and utilized qualitative design to identify students 2 ̆ 7 understanding of argumentation, trace their learning trajectories, examine potential use of the combination of talk and writing, and analyze the cognitive processes involved when talk and writing were used as learning tools. Due to the lack of studies that focus on the elementary level, this study was conducted in a fifth-grade classroom that used the Science Writing Heuristic (SWH) approach with 22 students participating. Six students were selected for interviewing intensively. Multiple sources of data were collected, including classroom observations, semi-structured interviews, students 2 ̆ 7 writing samples, and the researcher 2 ̆ 7 s field notes. To strengthen the interpretations, data analysis was conducted using three different approaches: (1) the constant comparative method, (<b>2)</b> the <b>enumerative</b> approach, and (3) in-depth analysis of knowledge construction trajectory (KCT) episodes. The results showed that as fifth-grade students had more opportunities to practice, they could develop a more sophisticated understanding of argumentation, use talk and writing as learning tools to negotiate their ideas with peers, engage in more complex cognitive processes, and take ownership for their learning in science. Three major findings are discussed: (1) increased understanding of argumentative components in public negotiations, (2) increased ability to craft written arguments, and (3) five patterns in the use of talk and writing for knowledge construction and cognitive processes. The findings have informed theories about argumentative practice, the use of language as a learning tool, and science learning from six aspects: (1) understanding of argumentation, (2) ability to craft written arguments, (3) use of talk and writing, (4) cognitive processes, (5) meaning of negotiation, and (6) methodology consideration. This study provides insights into the design of an argument-based environment in which students can develop successful argumentative practices.
