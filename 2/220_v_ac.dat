The mechanical types often have gold-plated contacts that do not corrode, to allow reliable low-power switching. A few types are capable of switching 120 or <b>220</b> <b>V</b> <b>AC</b> power at several amperes, and are better suited to direct switching of the AC power to a device than the gold-plated contact switches.

50|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of the newer}} electronics is price. It can cost 3 to 5 times more per lamp to use electronic ballasts than traditional choke ballasts, which is why choke ballasts are still used {{in the majority of}} new tanning systems. Another {{disadvantage of}} the older style choke ballast is they are designed for European electricity, and require incoming voltage in the range of <b>220</b> <b>V</b> <b>AC</b> and 230 V AC. Most US homes have 240 V service and businesses use 208 V three-phase service that requires these beds to use a buck-boost transformer in order to receive the proper voltage. Too low a voltage will result in the lamp starter not letting the lamp ignite (or at the least, very slowly) whereas too high a voltage can lead to premature failure in the starters and lamps. The average cost of these transformers is $200 to $250. While this makes the newer electronics cost about the same for the typical tanning bed, buckboost transformers are usually sold separately, so the total cost is not always obvious to the consumer at first glance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Single-phase {{induction}} motors {{are widely}} used in household electric motor applications. Although most electric appliances require a few amount of kilo-watt input, minimizing power losses during their operation gives a great benefit resulting in nationwide electric energy used by householders. In this paper, a model-based simulation for loss minimization using the space-phasor theory is proposed. Instead of a fixed <b>220</b> <b>V,</b> 50 Hz <b>AC</b> power source, a variable-voltage,variable-frequency (VVVF) control scheme is assumed to function the AC supply. By formulating and solving a constrained optimization of single-phase induction motor drives with VVVF, operation of the single-phase induction motor with minimum power losses can be attained. To evaluate this control strategy, test cases of a single-phase induction motor drive with variable mechanical loads are situated to evaluate its performance.

The research has shown highest impedance for crabs {{in the region of}} 40 - 100 Hz, confirming 50 Hz as an adequate frequency. Crabs, however, have a high and size-dependent resistance. In order to stun the crab within 1 s, the direct exposure must be <b>220</b> <b>V,</b> 50 Hz <b>AC,</b> however, due to the high resistance, at least 10 s exposure is recommended. To ensure no revival the crab should be pre-chilled and kept in air or ice water after stunning. In a large scale test with 300 crabs placed in ice after stunning, no signs of conscience were observed before death. Percentage loss of extremities (claws or feet) was relatively independent of voltage or exposure time, and typically 3 - 6 % loss at <b>220</b> <b>V.</b> Due to the high contact resistance measured, effect of current is lost rapidly. To ensure good contact, spraying of the crabs with salt water prior to stunning and use of a conveyor belt to avoid single contact point between electrodes and crab, is recommended.

It is therefore recommended usage of a minimum current exposure time, 20 s maximum, and 10 s being optimum in most cases...|$|R

This need motivated the design of a power stabilizer (UPSz). Method of Pulse with modulation (PWM) was adopted. This method is capable of modulating a varying input to a stabilized output. Two input sources were considered; a fluctuating <b>220</b> <b>V</b> volt mains supply and a constant 12 V battery. The 12 V battery was rectified to provide an AC power supply to the load {{in the absence of the}} utility mains.
