The directed evolution of phosphotriesterases {{to enhance the}} breakdown of poor substrates is desirable {{for the purposes of}} bioremediation. A limiting factor in the identification of phosphotriesterase mutants with increased activity is the ability to effectively screen large mutant libraries. To this end, we have investigated the possibility of coupling phosphotriesterase activity to cell growth by using methyl paraoxon as the sole phosphorus source. The catabolism of paraoxon to phosphate would occur via the stepwise enzymatic hydrolysis of paraoxon to <b>dimethyl</b> <b>phosphate,</b> methyl phosphate, and then phosphate. The Escherichia coli strain DH 10 B expressing the phosphotriesterase from Agrobacterium radiobacter P 230 (OpdA) is unable to grow when paraoxon is used as the sole phosphorus source.

The enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing <b>dimethyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> has been previously characterized as a nonspecific phosphohydrolase.
