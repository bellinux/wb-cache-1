25|$|Tanaka {{was highly}} {{expected}} to be the staff ace of Team Japan in the 2013 WBC, but poor form in the build-up to the tournament led to concern over his performance. He started the pool opener against Brazil and conceded an unearned run. He came on as a reliever against Cuba and again conceded a run, before appearing to return to his usual form by striking out 6 batters in 2 innings. Tanaka again came on as a reliever against Chinese Taipei and had <b>2</b> <b>good</b> innings, shutting out the side with 4 strike outs, before conceding the equalizer in his third inning {{at the bottom of the}} 8th. Up to that point, Tanaka's inconsistency produced an ERA of 3.00, allowing 10 hits and 3 runs (2 earned) in 6 innings while striking out 10.|$|E

500|$|An Ofsted report, {{following}} an October 2010 inspection, rated the school's services against specific criteria and assigned an overall quality rating of Grade 1 (outstanding). This compares to an overall rating of Grade <b>2</b> (<b>good)</b> {{in the previous}} report published in 2008. In the latest report, [...] "organisation" [...] and health and safety provision were upgraded to Grade 1 while boarding accommodation was rated Grade 2. Other areas assessed included [...] "helping children to achieve", to [...] "make a positive contribution" [...] and to [...] "enjoy what they do" [...] and these remained Grade 1 (outstanding).

2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that four things require {{constant}} application of energy: (1) Torah study, (<b>2)</b> <b>good</b> deeds, (3) prayer, and (4) one's worldly occupation. In support of the first two, the Baraita cited God's injunction in [...] "Only be strong and very courageous to observe to do according to all the law that My servant Moses enjoined upon you." [...] The Rabbis deduced that one must [...] "be strong" [...] in Torah and [...] "be courageous" [...] in good deeds. In support {{of the need for}} strength in prayer, the Rabbis cited [...] "Wait for the Lord, be strong and let your heart take courage, yea, wait for the Lord." [...] And in support of the need for strength in work, the Rabbis cited [...] "Be of good courage, and let us prove strong for our people." ...|$|E
60|$|Before {{dismissing the}} subject of numerals, I would call {{attention}} to a few other associations connected with them. They are often personified by children, and characters are assigned to them, it may be {{on account of the}} part they play in the multiplication table, or owing to some fanciful association with their appearance or their sound. To the minds of some persons the multiplication table appears dramatised, and any chance group of figures may afford a plot for a tale. I have collated six full and trustworthy accounts, and find a curious dissimilarity in the personifications and preferences; thus the number 3 is described as (1) disliked; (2) a treacherous sneak; (3) a good old friend; (4) delightful and amusing; (5) a female companion to 2; (6) a feeble edition of 9. In one point alone do I find any approach to unanimity, and that is in the respect paid to 12, as in the following examples:--(1) important and influential; (<b>2)</b> <b>good</b> and cautious--so good as to be almost noble; (3) a more beautiful number than 10, from the many multiples that make it up--in other words, its kindly relations to so many small numbers; (4) a great love for 12, a large-hearted motherly person {{because of the number of}} little ones that it takes, as it were, under its protection. The decimal system seemed to me treason against this motherly 12.--All this concurs with the importance assigned for other reasons to the number 12 in the Number-Form.|$|E

50|$|The No <b>2</b> <b>Goods</b> Shed {{was built}} in 1889-90 to replace {{previous}} timber and corrugated iron structures which had proved inadequate for the increased freight experienced in Melbourne during the boom years of the 1880s. The contract was awarded to builders A.P. Tozer and Company on 19 August 1889 for £72,943 17s 5 1/2d. The office section was extended to the north in 1907. No <b>2</b> <b>Goods</b> Shed {{was one of several}} construction projects at the time, which reflected the expansion of the Victorian Railways system. The Railways Headquarters Building in Spencer Street was constructed between 1888 and 1893, while the Flinders Street Viaduct, Flinders Street Extension and the retaining wall just south of the goods yards were also constructed around this time.|$|R
