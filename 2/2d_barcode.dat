Some countries, e.g. Austria, Canada, Germany, Russia, UK and the USA allow their citizens to hold two or more passports of their country to circumvent such travel restrictions, but some countries (including Austria and Germany) also restrict or forbid the holding of two passports of two different countries, i.e. dual citizenship. However for the past several years, stamps are no longer used at Ben Gurion airport (since January 15, 2013) and also land border crossings with Jordan. Instead, entry and departure records are printed on small slips of paper, which include the name of the traveller, the photo read from the epassport, the date, the visa status, and other details. The slips also include a <b>2D</b> <b>barcode</b> which is used as a gatepass to pass through the gate out of the passport control hall.|$|E

In this study, we used the internal transcribed spacer <b>2</b> (ITS <b>2)</b> <b>barcode</b> to identify 69 samples belonging to six species, including Acanthopanacis cortex and its adulterants. The nearest distance, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and neighbor-joining (NJ) tree methods were used to evaluate the identification ability of the ITS <b>2</b> <b>barcode.</b> According to the kimura- 2 -parameter model, the intraspecific distance of Eleutherococcus nodiflorus ITS 2 sequences ranged from 0 to 0. 0132. The minimum interspecific distance between E. nodiflorus and E. giraldii was 0. 0221, which was larger than the maximum intraspecific distance of E. nodiflorus. Three stable SNPs in ITS 2 can be used to distinguish Acanthopanacis cortex and its closely related species. The NJ tree indicated that the Acanthopanacis cortex samples clustered into one clade, which can be distinguished clearly from the adulterants of this herb. A secondary structure of ITS 2 provided another dimensionality to identify species.

Recently, there are researches dealing with watermark technique on <b>2</b> D <b>barcode</b> {{to prevent it from}} counterfeited or prepensely tampered.

Furthermore, it also needs to utilize original watermark or other auxiliary verification mechanism to achieve the barcode verification. In this paper, we propose a method called associative watermarking which is conducted by the concept of Association Rules (ARs) and the idea of Vector Quantization (VQ). Our method is a kind of blind watermarking, and it also can free the size limitation of an embedded watermark. Performing associative watermarking to <b>2</b> D <b>barcode</b> can reduce the embedded information amount, and using VQ indexing scheme can easily recall the embedded watermark for the purpose of barcode data authentication.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{ability to}} {{successfully}} identify and incriminate pathogen vectors {{is fundamental to}} effective pathogen control and management. This task is confounded by the existence of cryptic species complexes. Molecular markers can offer a highly effective means of species identification in such complexes and are routinely employed {{in the study of}} medical entomology. Here we evaluate a multi-locus system for the identification of potential malaria vectors in the Anopheles strodei subgroup. Methods Larvae, pupae and adult mosquitoes (n = 61) from the An. strodei subgroup were collected from 21 localities in nine Brazilian states and sequenced for the COI, ITS 2 and white gene. A Bayesian phylogenetic approach was used to describe the relationships in the Strodei Subgroup and the utility of COI and ITS <b>2</b> <b>barcodes</b> was assessed using the neighbor joining tree and “best close match” approaches. Results Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the COI, ITS 2 and white gene found support for seven clades in the An. strodei subgroup. The COI and ITS <b>2</b> <b>barcodes</b> were individually unsuccessful at resolving and identifying some species in the Subgroup. The COI barcode failed to resolve An. albertoi and An. strodei but successfully identified approximately 92 % of all species queries, while the ITS <b>2</b> <b>barcode</b> failed to resolve An. arthuri and successfully identified approximately 60 % of all species queries. A multi-locus COI-ITS <b>2</b> <b>barcode,</b> however, resolved all species in a neighbor joining tree and successfully identified all species queries using the “best close match” approach. Conclusions Our study corroborates the existence of An. albertoi, An. CP Form and An. strodei in the An. strodei subgroup and identifies four species under An. arthuri informally named A-D herein. The use of a multi-locus barcode is proposed for species identification, which has potentially important utility for vector incrimination. Individuals previously found naturally infected with Plasmodium vivax in the southern Amazon basin and reported as An. strodei are likely to have been from An. arthuri C identified in this study...|$|R
