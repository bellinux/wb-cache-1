An Airbitz wallet {{was the first to}} ever send a bitcoin transaction in Cuba. They invented the use of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) for bitcoin transactions. They also invented one-touch <b>2-factor</b> <b>authentication.</b>|$|E
50|$|The login method <b>2-factor</b> <b>authentication</b> is {{also known}} from {{e-banking}} systems. It works by sending a one-time code to a user’s mobile every time he or she logs into a given online account. Even if a hacker should get to the user’s login data, the information is useless without the additional security code.|$|E
50|$|Although {{companies}} may secure its internal networks, vulnerabilities can also occur through home networking. Email may {{be protected by}} methods, such as, creating a strong password, encrypting its contents, or using a digital signature. An email disclaimer {{may be used to}} warn unauthorized readers, but these are thought to be ineffective. Other ways that one can secure personal email accounts include enabling <b>2-factor</b> <b>authentication</b> in settings and use of an encrypted email service such as Protonmail or Mailfence.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{major news}} outlets have advised {{consumers}} of sites using Cloudflare {{to change their}} passwords, even for accounts protected by <b>2-factor</b> <b>authentication</b> {{as they could be}} at risk. Passwords of mobile apps too could have been impacted. Researchers at Arbor Networks, in an alert, suggested that [...] "For most of us, the only truly safe response to this large-scale information leak is to update our passwords for the Web sites and app-related services we use every day...Pretty much all of them." ...|$|E
50|$|Enterprise SMS-{{messaging}}, {{also known}} as application-to-peer messaging (A2P Messaging) or 2-way SMS, continue to grow steadily {{at a rate of}} 4% annually. Enterprise SMS applications are primarily focused on CRM and delivering highly targeted service messages such as parcel-delivery alerts, real-time notification of credit/debit card purchase confirmations to protect against fraud, and appointment confirmations. Another primary source of growing A2P message volumes is two-step verification (alternatively referred to as <b>2-factor</b> <b>authentication)</b> processes whereby users are delivered a one-time passcode over SMS and then are asked to enter that passcode online in order to verify their identity.|$|E
50|$|The UCS RADIUS app secures {{access to}} the network via the RADIUS protocol. The UCS-integrated SAML app {{provides}} a Single_sign-on identity provider for UCS based on the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol and the SimpleSAMLphp software framework. With help of the identity provider, a single sign-on functionality for third party web services and applications (e.g., Google Apps, Salesforce.com etc.) can be realized while the authentication is done at the identity provider itself. The user management is done via UCS where users are individually activated for particular web services. In addition, the authentication process can be extended by a second factor (<b>2-factor</b> <b>authentication)</b> via privacyIDEA from the App Center.|$|E
