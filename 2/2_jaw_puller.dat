60|$|Calls of men {{and cries}} of {{encouragement}} came sharply to them from close at hand, and they halted. There was an eager yelping, a scratching of feet, {{and a string of}} ice-rimed wolf-dogs, with hot-lolling tongues and dripping <b>jaws,</b> <b>pulled</b> up the slope and turned into the path ahead of them. On the sled, a long and narrow box of rough-sawed spruce told the nature of the freight. Two dog-drivers, a woman walking blindly, and a black-robed priest, made up the funeral cortege. A few paces farther on the dogs were again put against the steep, and with whine and shout and clatter the unheeding clay was hauled on and upward to its ice-hewn hillside chamber.|$|R

50|$|In 1995, a low-budget direct-to-video {{movie called}} Jaws in Japan (also called Psycho Shark) was {{released}}.

3000|$|... <b>2</b> <b>jaw</b> surgery {{can have}} {{favorable}} effects on TMJ symptoms {{in patients with}} dentofacial deformities. The results in {{this study showed that}} even if TMJ symptoms were not treated before the surgery, <b>2</b> <b>jaw</b> surgery could have therapeutic effects for TMJ symptoms while also provide good stability of condyles. This study has some differences from other similar studies. Firstly, we divided orthognathic patients into 2 groups contingent upon presence or absence of preoperative treatment for TMJ symptoms, unlike other studies in which TMJ symptoms concerned as the standard of classification. Secondly, we simultaneously analyzed postoperative stability of condylar position with 3 D CBCT while examining changes of TMJ symptoms. On the other hand, there are also some limitations: (1) The number of the orthognathic patients without any preceding treatments for TMJ symptoms before the surgery were not enough. (2) We had only mandibular prognathic patients with class III malocclusion among various dentofacial deformities. (3) We did not use validated scales such as the modified Helkimo index, craniomandibular index, and the Research Diagnostic Criteria [14, 22, 23]. We collected only the symptomatic data by simple self-report form.|$|R
25|$|However, later {{research}} {{indicated that}} forward and sideways jaw movement was possible, the skull {{being able to}} withstand considerable forces. Euoplocephalus {{appears to have been}} able to make more complex movements. Tooth wear and jaw articulations (within the lower jaw and at the lower jaw-quadrate joint) suggest that the lower <b>jaws</b> were <b>pulled</b> back during feeding, and also slightly pivoted inward. This action would have sheared food.|$|R
30|$|This {{study showed}} {{improvements}} of preexisting TMJ symptoms and good condylar stability during the postoperative follow-up {{even though the}} patients were not treated for the TMJ symptoms before the surgery. Thus, We think that <b>2</b> <b>jaw</b> surgery patients with preexisting TMJ symptoms can have therapeutic effect exclusively attributed to the surgery unless the existence of acute and severe TMD before the surgery. However, the symptoms cannot be always improved {{and there would be}} some risk of symptomatic deterioration though the risk is very quite low.|$|R

Significances were assessed by the Wilcoxon signed rank test on SPSS ver. 20.0.|$|R
