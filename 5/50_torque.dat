40|$|Biodiesel is a mono-alkyl ester of {{vegetable}} oil, animal fat and recycled cooking oil. It {{has been recognized}} worldwide as an alternative source to replace the known petroleum reserves that are limited and eventually run out as to many aspects to be concerned like environmental and sustainability issues. It is commonly prepared by transesterification of triglycerides or the esterification of free fatty acid with methanol or ethanol by stirring and accelerated {{by the presence of}} base or acidic catalyst. In this study, palm oil transesterification reaction with ethanol will be conducted with a set of cooking oilabsolute ethanol ratios under the counter current flow system by using the extractive reactor column so that the data obtained can be used to investigate the behaviour of the reacting fluid that flows counter currently with the reactant so lvent. Different composition of the cooking oil and absolute ethanol were mixed and observed using viscometer under different RPM.

For RPM <b>50,</b> <b>torque</b> of ratio (cooking oil:absolute ethanol) 8 : 1 was 8. 3 % decreasing to 0. 2 % when the ratio was (cooking oil:absolute ethanol) 1 : 8.

40|$|Due to {{environmental}} aspects and emission legislations {{the automotive industry}} is striving towards more efficient combustion engines. Many engine control systems in production today are based on look-up tables which are calibrated for different operating conditions. Improvements {{can be done by}} constructing better control systems to make the engine run in optimal operating conditions more often than conventional control systems are able to do today. One such improvement could be to replace some look-up tables with feedback control of wisely chosen properties of the combustion process. However, even if a promising property is found and quantified it must be measurable either directly or indirectly. Also, the property must be controllable using a suitable actuator. This thesis concentrates on estimating individual cylinder combustion phasing using a torque sensor mounted on a crankshaft. The combustion phasing is quantified using a measure called <b>50</b> % <b>torque</b> ratio and it is controllable by modifying the spark advance for each cylinder. A control system has been implemented in an engine test bench to be able to test the ideas. Several test cases have been designed to demonstrate the capability of the system to control the combustion phasing individually for each cylinder and to compensate for simulated external disturbances in steady-state conditions. The control system is also equipped with self-optimising functionality by using an extremum seeking controller to detect for which value of the torque ratio that maximises generated work from each cylinder. The resulting implemented control system is capable of maintaining a desired set-point for the torque ratio in steady-state conditions. Transient conditions have not been evaluated.

We therefore measured immediately after surgery the clinically applied torques. The median value was only 10 N m (range 8 - 14 N m). We wondered whether this value is appropriate to maintain the wire pretension and thereby to achieve sufficient fracture stability during dynamic loading of the device for a longer period. METHODS: A material testing machine dynamically loaded one wire mounted on one ring. Several configurations were tested. RESULTS: A quick decrease in wire tension to a steady state situation was seen. In the most stable configuration (20 N m wire fixation <b>torque)</b> <b>50</b> % of the initial 90 kg wire pretension remained after dynamic loading with 200 N. In the least stable configuration (10 N m torque) considerable wire slippage occurred even without loading and no tension remained after loading! No plastic deformation of the wires was observed so loss of wire tension was due to slippage of the wires through the fixation bolts. INTERPRETATION: With the small fixation torques used in clinical practice considerable wire tension is lost even after a few loading cycles. Further research should address the question whether preservation of a higher wire tension during long term loading promotes faster fracture healing...|$|R

40|$|Background and aim:Fatigue is the {{inability}} to generate the maximal force that can be produced by the muscle. Fatigue is a subject that patients and athletes frequently encounter. Fatigue is one factor that limits muscle function and may lead to various pain and injury conditions. It is most commonly caused either by repetitive motion or by sustained muscular contractions. Massage {{has been used for}} rehabilitation and relaxation for thousands of years. Massage is widely believed to have a beneficial effect on treating muscle fatigue and has been used in clinical and sports setting for that purpose. There is limited scientific evidence, however, to support the use of massage for enhancing performance and recovery from injury, or for preventing injury. The comparison of massage and rest on the knee extensor muscles fatigue after maximal isokinetic contractions is the main objective of this research.  Materials and methods: Fifteen healthy female aged between 20 - 30 volunteered to participate in this research. They did {{at least once a week}} some non-professional light sporting activities. Each of volunteers was evaluated in 3 different times. The first session was in order to familiarize the volunteers with the test and Isokinetic. For the main test, each of the volunteers was evaluated twice with one week interval. At the start of each session after warm up, the following parameters were measured: Perceived fatigue by Visual Analog Scale ¸average peak torque and average power maximal concentric of quadriceps at the velocity of 60 degrees per second by Isokinetic apparatus. Then in order to fatigue protocol ¸ the subjects were asked to perform successive and maximal quadriceps contractions until three subsequent quadriceps torque output reaches below <b>50</b> percent maximal <b>torque</b> output. Afterwards average peak torque and average power was measured. The extent of perceived fatigue was evaluated as before. Subjects then either received massage on the knee extensors or rested for 15 minute duration. Recovery from fatigue was quantified using average peak torque (APT), average power (AP) and perceived recovery scale (VAS). Results: After maximal fatigue and decrease in <b>torque</b> output, below <b>50</b> percent maximal <b>torque,</b> 15 minutes of massage could change APT after fatigue from mean 56. 70 (Nm) to 91. 53 (Nm)), AP from 38. 64 to 63. 62 (Nm) and VAS from 90. 06 to 10. 20 (mm). After 15 minute rest could change APT from 55. 36 to 68. 10 (Nm), AP from 37. 69 to 48 (Nm) and VAS from 90. 06 to 20. 73 (mm). Conclusion: There was significant difference between rest and massage conditions for recovery of fatigue. Massage was an effective intervention for enhancing muscle performance and recovery from fatigue but rest didn`t have such an effect. In both cases, recovery stage (massage or rest) caused significant change in perceived fatigue but massage is more effective on the decrease of perceived fatigue. Therefore, massage has been more effective than rest as a strategy to return to normal state and has caused more relief in perceived fatigue...|$|R

In addition, with elapsing time, MK and FAC were found to have more influence on torque plastic viscosity and yield stress values in comparison with the other admixtures. However, increase in the yield values were more pronounced in comparison with the torque plastic viscosity values.

40|$|Abstract Background How {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) organizes the joint {{dynamics}} for multi-joint movement is a complex problem, because of the passive interaction among segmental movements. Previous studies have demonstrated that the CNS predictively compensates for interaction torque (INT) which is arising from the movement of the adjacent joints. However, most of these studies have mainly examined quick movements, presumably because the current belief is that the effects of INT are not significant at slow speeds. The functional contribution of INT for multijoint movements performed in various speeds is still unclear. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the contribution of INT to a planer reaching in a wide range of motion speeds for healthy subjects. Methods Subjects performed reaching movements toward five targets under three different speed conditions. Joint position data were recorded using a 3 -D motion analysis device (<b>50</b> Hz). <b>Torque</b> components, muscle torque (MUS), interaction torque (INT), gravity torque (G), and net torque (NET) were calculated by solving the dynamic equations for the shoulder and elbow. NET at a joint which produces the joint kinematics will be an algebraic sum of torque components; NET = MUS - G - INT. Dynamic muscle torque (DMUS = MUS-G) was also calculated. Contributions of INT impulse and DMUS impulse to NET impulse were examined. Results The relative contribution of INT to NET was not dependent on speed for both joints at every target. INT was additive (same direction) to DMUS at the shoulder joint, while in the elbow DMUS counteracted (opposed to) INT. The trajectory of reach was linear and two-joint movements were coordinated with a specific combination at each target, regardless of motion speed. However, DMUS at the elbow was opposed to the direction of elbow movement, and its magnitude varied from trial to trial in order to compensate for the variability of INT. Conclusion Interaction torque was important at slow speeds. Muscle torques at the two joints were not directly related to each other to produce coordinated joint movement during a reach. These results support Bernstein's idea that coordinated movement is not completely determined by motor command in multi-joint motion. Based on the data presented in this study and the work of others, a model for the connection between joint torques (muscle and passive torques including interaction torque) and joint coordination is proposed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background and aim: Asymmetric {{motions of}} trunk, {{external}} forces and other occupational {{factors such as}} frequent bending and twisting, lifting and forceful movement contribute to low back disorders. However, the dynamic and three-Dimensional motions of trunk at varying exertion levels were not addressed in literature. Hence, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the movement pattern and motor output during resisted trunk three-dimensional motion. Materials and Methods: Thirty healthy male subjects randomly performed dynamic asymmetric trunk motion at four resistance levels (nominal resistance, 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque) while positioned in standing with the L 5 -S 1 interspinous space aligned with the flexion / extension axis of isostation B 200. Under each resistance condition, movement patterns (range of motion), motor output (maximum torque) of the trunk were measured.   Results: In general, with increasing resistance from nominal to 75 % MVC torque, the maximum torque of trunk in different directions of motion (flexion, extension, right & left lateral flexion, right & left rotation) increased significantly (p= 0. 000). With increasing resistance from nominal to <b>50</b> %& MVC <b>torque,</b> the range of motion of the trunk decreased significant (p 0. 0083). Conclusion: When the resistance level is increased, the created external forces must be balanced by internal forces generated by trunk muscles.

Under these conditions, spine injuries may be enhanced...|$|R

Model based diagnosis is based on measurements made by sensors at the truck, while predictive analysis is based more on statistics and retrieved data about the lifetime of a truck in specific environments. The diagnosis system for the drive wheel is based on a model made in Matlab's Simulink. Due to poor documentation, rough simplifications in the model have been made. However, one can still see the differences of principle. The main thought was detecting a difference in the lowest torque level from the engine, varying the diameter of the drive wheel. By measurements made directly at the truck, different torques could be observed with varying diameter of the drive wheel, varying load on the truck and varying friction in the gearbox. Using hypothesis tests, it is possible to say whether the drive wheel is worn out or not. Results show that if the drive wheel diameter is reduced by 25 mm, torque is reduced by 7 % and if the drive wheel diameter is reduced as much as <b>50</b> mm, a <b>torque</b> reduction of 11 % would be achieved...|$|R
40|$|A new haptic {{interface}} device {{has been developed}} which uses Lorentz force magnetic levitation for actuation. With this device, the user grasps a oating rigid body {{to interact with the}} system. The levitated moving part grasped by the user contains curved oval wound coils and LEDs embedded in a hemispherical shell with a handle xed at its center. The stationary base contains magnet assemblies facing the otor coils and optical position sensors facing the otor LEDs. The device is mounted in the top cover of a desk-side cabinet enclosure containing all the ampli ers, control hardware, microprocessing, and power supplies needed for operation. A network connection provides communication with a workstation to allowinteraction with simulated 3 D environments in real time. Ideally, the {{haptic interface}} device should reproduce the dynamics of the modelled or remote environment with such high delity that the user cannot distinguish interaction with the device from interaction with a real object in a real environment. In practice, this ideal can only be approached with a delity that depends on its dynamic properties such as position and force bandwidths, maximum forces and accelerations, position resolution, and realizable impedance range. The motion range of the moving part is approximately 25 mm and 15 - 20 degrees in all directions. A current of 0. 75 A is required in three of the six coils to generate the vertical force to lift the 850 g levitated mass, dissipating only 13. 5 W. Peak forces of over <b>50</b> N and <b>torques</b> of over 6 Nm are achievable with the present ampli ers without overheating the actuator coils. Other measured performance results include sti ness ranges from 0. 005 N/mm to 25. 0 N/mm and a position control bandwidth of approximately 75 Hz...|$|R
40|$|Load {{perturbations}} {{were applied}} to the arm of human subjects under conditions where both limb segments (upper arm and forearm) were free to move. The perturbations consisted of pulses of <b>torque</b> <b>50</b> ms in duration and of pseudo-random sequences of such pulses. They {{were applied to}} either the forearm or the upper arm. Under all conditions, the perturbations resulted in angular motion at the shoulder and elbow joints and evoked consistent responses in muscles acting about these joints (biceps, triceps, anterior and posterior deltoid). Activity in biceps and triceps was not related simply to angular motion at the elbow joint. For example, activation of biceps could be evoked during elbow flexion (by applying a torque perturbation at the shoulder) as well as during elbow extension (by applying a torque perturbation at the elbow). The effect of varying degrees of dynamic coupling between upper arm and forearm on EMG responses was investigated by applying torque perturbations to the upper arm {{over a wide range}} of elbow angles. When the forearm is extended, such a perturbation induces a greater amount of elbow flexion than when the forearm is in a flexed position. The results of these experiments showed that the larger was the amount of flexion of the forearm induced by the perturbation, the larger was the activation of biceps. The results are incompatible with the notion of a negative feedback of total muscle length as being responsible for the EMG activity following the load perturbations. It is suggested that the EMG responses can best be interpreted functionally in terms of parameters more global than muscle length. Among such global parameters, changes in net torque at a joint resulting from the perturbation gave the best correlation with the pattern of EMG activities observed...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a novel methodology {{for evaluation of}} in service loads applied to the output shafts of automatic transmissions. It also {{presents a}} novel methodology of data reduction for shaft load signals {{as an alternative to}} the cycle counting methods. Current durability testing of automatic transmission output shafts uses <b>50</b> 000 stall <b>torque</b> cycles from zero to wide open throttle. In the majority of cases, these requirements lead to an over design that can result in an unnecessarily bulky transmission system. As a solution to this problem a novel methodology for evaluation of loads applied to the output shafts of automatic transmissions was developed. The methodology is based on real world loading conditions and therefore leads to a more realistic estimation of the fatigue life of shafts. The methodology can be used as a tool for shaft optimisation in different drive conditions. Using the developed methodology the effects of different road conditions on the fatigue life of a transmission output shaft were compared. Four routes having differing driving conditions were investigated and of those routes, the route with most stop-start events resulted in the greatest reduction in fatigue life. A novel methodology of data reduction for shaft load signals was also developed. The methodology is based on knowledge of the bandwidth and dynamic range of the expected in-service load signal. This novel methodology allows significant reduction of the volume of data to be acquired. It preserves the time sequence of peaks and valleys of the signal, which is vital in the case of fatigue analysis. This is in contrast to current methods based on cycle counting. Cycle counting methods achieve high data reduction but do not preserve the time sequence of the signal. The developed novel methodology has been validated on the newly developed data acquisition system capable of real time data acquisition and compression of shaft torque signal. The performed tests show that the proposed one-channel low cost system equipped with 1 GB compact flash card can store well over 10 000 hrs of load history...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{whether there is}} a direct correlation between the level of vertical misfit at the abutment/implant interface and torque losses (detorque) in abutment screws. A work model was obtained from a metal matrix with five 3. 75 x 9 mm external hex implants with standard platform (4. 1 mm). Four frameworks were waxed using UCLA type abutments and one-piece cast in commercially pure titanium. The misfit was analyzed with a comparator microscope after 20 Ncm torque. The highest value of misfit observed per abutment was used. The torque required to loose the screw was evaluated using a digital torque meter. The torque loss values, measured by the torque meter, were assumed as percentage of initial torque (100 %) given to abutment screws. Pearson's correlation (&# 945;= 0. 05) between the misfit values (29. 08 ± 8. 78 µm) and the percentage of detorque (50. 71 ± 11. 37 %) showed no statistically significant correlation (p= 0. 295). Within the limitations of this study, it may be concluded that great vertical misfits dot not necessarily implies in higher detorque values. Este trabalho teve como objetivo correlacionar o nível de desajuste vertical pilar/implante a perda do torque aplicado (destorque). Um modelo de trabalho foi obtido a partir de uma matriz metálica com cinco implantes tipo hexágono externo (Titamax, Neodent, Curitiba, Brasil) com plataforma regular (4, 1 mm). Sobre esta matriz, quatro infra-estruturas foram enceradas utilizando pilares tipo UCLA e fundidas em monobloco com titânio comercialmente puro (Tritan grau I, Dentaurum, Alemanha). Os desajustes foram analisados com um microscópio óptico comparador (Mytutoyo, Japão) após torque de 20 Ncm. O maior valor de desajuste observado por pilar foi utilizado. O valor do torque de desaperto, avaliado com um torquímetro digital (TQ- 680, Instrutherm, Brasil), foi calculado em porcentagem do valor do torque inicial (100 %) dado aos parafusos protéticos. O teste de correlação de Pearson (p< 0, 05), entre os valores de desajuste (29, 08 ± 8, 78 µm) e as porcentagens da perda de <b>torque</b> (<b>50,</b> 71 ± 11, 37 %), não mostrou correlação estatisticamente significante (p= 0, 295) entre tais fatores. Dentro das limitações do estudo, pode ser concluído que não necessariamente grandes valores de desajustes verticais implicarão em grades perdas de torque...|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis aims to conduct a systematic study of the two stage turbocharging system to improve the Diesel engine transient performance as well as NOX and CO 2 emissions {{with a focus on}} the improved turbocharger matching and the control of the charging system, through the use of high fidelity engine models backed by experimental results. To perform the analytical study, commercial 1 D simulation software has been used in the process of system characterisation and control strategy design. To validate the analytical results, a two stage turbocharging system was installed on a production diesel engine and tested on a transient engine test bench. The test results were then used to further calibrate the 1 D engine/turbocharger model. Several other technologies were also investigated in simulation to explore their potential to further improve the system. Unlike most studies in the literature, this project focused on the system benefit of the engine and turbochargers, instead of conducting optimisation solely at the component level. The engine global parameters, such as the engine fuel consumption, emission levels and the transient response were the main parameters to be considered and were also best suited to the strengths of the 1 D simulation method. The interactive use of both the analytical and experimental methods was also a strong point of this study. A novel control strategy for the system was proposed and demonstrated in the simulation. Experiments confirmed the validity of this control strategy and provided data for further model calibration. The comparison of the test results of the baseline engine to those obtained with the two stage turbocharged engine system verified the benefits of the novel turbocharging arrangement and control scheme. Transient response (T 1090) was improved, with a <b>50</b> % faster <b>torque</b> rise at 1000 rpm; the fuel consumption over the NEDC was 4 % lower and NOx emissions over the NEDC were 28 % lower. In the meantime, the study also revealed shortcomings of the system, such as the lack of EGR control at low speed, low load condition and a mid-speed fuel consumption deterioration of 13 % on average at 3000 rpm due to excessive back pressure. With a novel 1 D model corroborated using test results, exploratory simulation was done to rectify the aforementioned shortcomings and to further improve the system. Simulation results showed that by implementing VGT and ball bearing technology in the high pressure stage of the two stage system, the EGR controllability at low speed was regained and the excessive back pressure at high speed was improved. Consequently, the fuel consumption was only increased by 1. 3 % compared to the baseline NEDC operation and the transient response was on par with the original two stage system, with only 0. 05 s slower in torque rise at 1000 rpm, and still 48 % faster than the baseline VGT system. Furthermore, the NOx emission can be expected to be greatly improved in the upcoming more intensive drive cycles compared to the NEDC cycle, with simulation showing NEDC NOX emissions dropped by 1 %, comparing to a substantial reduction of 11 % in WLTC...|$|R
40|$|Haptic {{teleoperation}} is {{a promising}} approach {{for dealing with}} the manipulation of micro-objects, fabricated in small series or as prototypes, and in processes which are novel or uncertain. Human operators provide their ability to plan, understand and react when faced with unexpected situations during the manipulation process, while robotic devices ensure the levels of precision required by the tasks. In order to improve the state of this field, this thesis intends to understand how to better support a human operator performing micromanipulation tasks, and based on that understanding develop a system for teloperated micromanipulation, focusing on the slave-side devices. The first stage of this research is an in-depth analysis of the requirements coming from the kind of tasks which the system must deal with, from the support that is possible and useful to give to the human operator, and from the abilities and limitations of that user. Following those requirements, a system-concept is developed, consisting of the integration of commercially available products with custom developed components. In particular, a 6 DOF magnetic levitation stage is developed as a fine positioning stage for the slave robot, achieving a movement range of 200 x 200 x 200 micrometers and rotations of 18 to 42 mrad, with Minimum Incremental Motion of 50 nm and 3. 5 to 7 microradians. A silicon based force sensor is also developed to explore possibilities for force and torque sensing during micromanipulation. This force sensor measure loads in 6 DOF, within a range of 4 to 30 mN in forces and 4 to <b>50</b> uNm in <b>torques,</b> and with noise levels up to 13 to 27 uN/sqrt(Hz) and 11 to 43 nNm/sqrt(Hz). The system is integrated and characterized, and its usefulness is demonstrated through the performance of micromanipulation tasks by human operators. A general conclusion drawn from this research is that in order to make haptic teleoperated micromanipulation systems a viable and competitive option, it is vital to identify the kind of tasks for which haptic teleoperated micromanipulation systems can be a solution, and to optimize such systems and its components for these applications and for the haptic teleoperation scenario. In order to do so, one must understand both the advantages and limitations that this approach offers compared to its main competitors: automatic manipulation, self assembly, unaided manipulation by hand, among others. In particular, the highest potential of teloperated systems is on dealing with uncertain situations, thanks to the reasoning abilities of the human operators. Therefore, the use of these systems in structured and repetitive tasks does not constitute a fair demonstration of their advantages. Likewise, the use of components meant for automatic manipulation which often over-perform some of the motor abilities of the user, results in systems which are more complex and expensive than required, thus undermining some of the main advantages of using teleoperated systems. Following that reasoning, this work places particular attention to the definition of the requirements. By carefully studying the consequences of including a human operator in the system, and the special needs arising from the tasks and support modes, it is possible to optimize system components for this particular niche. Thus, the resulting system can deal with the situations normally encountered in teleoperated micromanipulation, without incurring in significant costs or complexities often found in systems intended for automatic manipulation, and without having to compromise properties useful for this application.
