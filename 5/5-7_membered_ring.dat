The results obtained from these in vitro studies demonstrate that PikAIII and PikAIV generate the 12 <b>membered</b> <b>ring</b> macrocycle most efficiently when engaged in their native protein-protein interaction.

The enthalpy for relieving the ring strain must be very favorable for ROMP to occur because the entropy decreases during polymerization (see Gibbs free energy).

40|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} (CVD) on Cu foil {{is one of}} {{the most}} promising methods to produce graphene samples despite of introducing numerous grain boundaries into the perfect graphene lattice. A rich variety of GB structures can be realized experimentally by controlling the parameters in the CVD method. Grain boundaries contain non-hexagonal carbon rings (4, 5, 7, 8 <b>membered</b> <b>rings)</b> and vacancies in various ratios and arrangements. Using wave packet dynamic (WPD) simulations and tight-binding electronic structure calculations, we have studied the effect of the structure of GBs on the transport properties. Three model GBs with increasing disorder were created in the computer: a periodic 5 - 7 GB, a "serpentine" GB, and a disordered GB containing 4, 8 <b>membered</b> <b>rings</b> and vacancies. It was found that for small energies (E = EF ± 1 eV) the transmission decreases with increasing disorder. Four <b>membered</b> <b>rings</b> and vacancies are identified as the principal scattering centers.

40|$|Many {{pharmaceuticals}} have {{fused ring}} systems and their bioactivity tends to increase {{with the introduction}} of fluorine containing functional groups. Currently known methods to create 3, 3 -difluoro- 2 -oxindole compounds have several significant drawbacks including the requirement of explosive materials, the use of over one equivalence of copper reagents, and inefficiency for formation of larger sized fused ring systems. For these reasons, we sought to discover reaction conditions that could create not only 3, 3,-difluoro- 2 -oxindole systems, but expand into the syntheses of six, seven, and even eight <b>membered</b> fluorinated fused <b>ring</b> products.
