25|$|Sulfasalazine {{has been}} a major agent in the therapy of mild to {{moderate}} ulcerative colitis for over 50 years. In 1977, Mastan S. Kalsi et al. determined that 5-aminosalicylic acid (<b>5-ASA</b> and mesalazine) was the therapeutically active component in sulfasalazine. Since then, many <b>5-ASA</b> compounds have been developed with the aim of maintaining efficacy but reducing the common side effects associated with the sulfapyridine moiety in sulfasalazine.|$|E
25|$|Sulfasalazine, {{also known}} as Azulfidine. This drug is in a {{traditional}} class of antibiotics, but decomposes in the intestine, releasing <b>5-ASA.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{maintenance}} of remission of ulcerative colitis, there are 3 controlled, randomized, double blind (double-dummy) clinical studies which have proven equivalence of Mutaflor {{and the standard}} of care mesalazine (<b>5-ASAs).</b> These include Kruis et al. 1997, Rembacken et al.1999and Kruis et al. 2004.|$|R
25|$|Mesalazine, {{also known}} as 5-aminosalicylic acid, mesalamine, or <b>5-ASA.</b> Brand names include: Asacol, Octasa, Pentasa, Salofalk, Lialda, Ipocol, Apriso, and Mezavant.|$|E
25|$|In the {{intestine}} sulfasalazine {{is converted}} to <b>5-ASA</b> and sulfapyridine, {{which is responsible for}} some of its side-effects, and which should be monitored in patients taking sulfasalazine. Sulfapyridine levels above 50µg/L are associated with the side-effects.|$|E
25|$|Herbal {{medications}} {{are used}} by patients with ulcerative colitis. Compounds that contain sulfhydryl may have an effect in ulcerative colitis (under a similar hypothesis that the sulfa moiety of sulfasalazine may have activity {{in addition to the}} active <b>5-ASA</b> component). One randomized control trial evaluated the over-the-counter medication S-methylmethionine and found a significant decreased rate of relapse when the medication was used in conjunction with oral sulfasalazine.|$|E
25|$|Possible {{side effects}} of <b>5-ASA</b> include, nausea and vomiting, reduced sperm count and damage to red or white blood cells, or to the liver, kidneys, pancreas, nerves or hearing. Allergic {{reactions}} to sulfasalazine characterized by dizziness, fever and skin rash {{have been reported in}} a small percentage of patients. In some cases, sulfasalazine can exacerbate ulcerative colitis resulting in diarahea, abdominal cramps and discomfort.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>5-ASA</b> is poorly-absorbed by the intestines, {{and hence}} {{provides}} topical relief within the intestine. It {{is therefore a}} non-systemic drug. <b>5-ASA</b> {{is related to the}} systemic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as Aspirin and Ibuprofen.|$|E
2500|$|The {{anti-inflammatory}} {{action in}} all these drugs is produced by 5-aminosalicylic acid (<b>5-ASA),</b> the active ingredient in Mesalazine. <b>5-ASA</b> is produced from the other drugs in the intestine.

2500|$|... <b>5-ASA</b> compounds, such as {{mesalazine}} and sulfasalazine, {{have shown}} to be of very little efficacy {{in the treatment of}} Crohn's disease, either for induction or for maintenance of remission. Current guidelines do not advise the use of <b>5-ASA</b> compounds in Crohn's disease.|$|E
2500|$|The {{free radical}} {{induction}} theory, discussed below, proposes that <b>5-ASA</b> is serving {{not just as}} an anti-inflammatory agent, {{but also as a}} free radical trap, destroying the hydroxyl and other radicals that may damage colonic epithelial barrier. [...] <b>5-ASA</b> may also be an inhibitor of TNF.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} to use Corticosteroids {{in conjunction with}} <b>5-ASA</b> drugs to bring about remission of ulcerative colitis. Thereafter {{it may be possible}} to maintain remission with 5-ASAs alone, though many patients require other, stronger immunosuppressive medications. [...] Corticosteroids should not be used for long-term therapy of UC, particularly without the concomitant use of an immunomodulator or anti-TNF.|$|E
2500|$|Ulcerative colitis can {{be treated}} {{with a number of}} medications, {{including}} <b>5-ASA</b> drugs such as sulfasalazine and mesalazine. Corticosteroids such as prednisone can also be used due to their immunosuppressive and short-term healing properties, but because their risks outweigh their benefits, they are not used long-term in treatment. Immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine and biological agents such as infliximab and adalimumab are given only if people cannot achieve remission with <b>5-ASA</b> and corticosteroids. Such treatments are used less commonly [...] due to their possible risk factors, including but not limited to increased risk of cancers in teenagers and adults, tuberculosis, and new or worsening heart failure (these side effects are rare). A formulation of budesonide was approved by the FDA for treatment of active ulcerative colitis in January 2013. The evidence on methotrexate does not show a benefit in producing remission in people with ulcerative colitis. Off-label use of drugs such as ciclosporin and tacrolimus has shown some benefits. Fexofenadine, an antihistamine drug used in treatment of allergies, has shown promise in a combination therapy in some studies. Opportunely, low gastrointestinal absorption (or high absorbed drug gastrointestinal secretion) of fexofenadine results in higher concentration at the site of inflammation. Thus, the drug may locally decrease histamine secretion by involved gastrointestinal mast cells and alleviate the inflammation.|$|E

5000|$|Around 90% of {{a dose of}} {{sulfasalazine}} {{reaches the}} colon, where {{most of it is}} metabolized by bacteria into sulfapyridine and mesalazine (also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid or <b>5-ASA).</b> Both metabolites are active; most of the sulfapyridine is absorbed and then further metabolized, but most mesalazine is not, and remains in the colon.|$|E

50|$|It {{is usually}} {{administered}} as the disodium salt. Balsalazide releases mesalazine, {{also known as}} 5-aminosalicylic acid, or <b>5-ASA,</b> in the large intestine.

50|$|The {{investigation}} {{includes a}} history, a physical examination including a thorough {{evaluation of the}} scrotum and testes, laboratory tests, and possibly imaging. History includes the general health, sexual health, past fertility, libido, and sexual activity. Past exposure {{to a number of}} agents needs to be queried including medical agents like hormone/steroid therapy, antibiotics, <b>5-ASA</b> inhibitors (sulfasalazine), alpha-blockers, 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors, chemotherapeutic agents, pesticides, recreational drugs (marijuana, excessive alcohol), and heat exposure of the testes. A history of surgical procedures of the genital system needs to be elicited. The family history needs to be assessed to look for genetic abnormalities.|$|E
50|$|Medications used {{to treat}} the {{symptoms}} of Crohn's disease include 5-aminosalicylic acid (<b>5-ASA)</b> formulations, prednisone, immunomodulators such as azathioprine (given as the prodrug for 6-mercaptopurine), methotrexate, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab and natalizumab. Hydrocortisone {{should be used in}} severe attacks of Crohn's disease. Biological therapies (biopharmaceuticals) are medications used to avoid long-term steroid use, decrease inflammation, and treat people who have fistulas with abscesses. The monoclonal antibody ustekinumab appears to be a safe treatment option, and may help people with moderate to severe active Crohn's disease. The long term safety and effectiveness of monoclonal antibody treatment is not known. The monoclonal antibody briakinumab is not effective for people with active Crohn's disease.|$|E
50|$|Other {{options for}} {{refractory}} symptoms of chronic urticaria include anti-inflammatory medications, omalizumab, and immunosuppressants. Potential anti-inflammatory agents include dapsone, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine. Dapsone is a sulfone antimicrobial agent and {{is thought to}} suppress prostaglandin and leukotriene activity. It is helpful in therapy-refractory cases and is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency. Sulfasalazine, a <b>5-ASA</b> derivative, is thought to alter adenosine release and inhibit IgE mediated mast cell degranulation, Sulfasalazine is a good option for people with anemia who cannot take dapsone. Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial agent that suppresses T lymphocytes. It has a low cost however it takes longer than dapsone or sulfasalazine to work.|$|E
