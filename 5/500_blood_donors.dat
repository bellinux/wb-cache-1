This technology is based on a single nucleotide extension of a primer, which is hybridized immediately adjacent to the site of mutation. The extended nucleotide that carries a reporter molecule (fluorescein) has the power to discriminate the genotype at the site of mutation. More recently, the prothrombin 20210 and thermolabile methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677 variants have been identified as possible risk factors associated with thrombophilia. This study describes the use of the FNC technology in a combined assay to detect factor V, prothrombin and MTHFR variants in a population of Australian <b>blood</b> <b>donors,</b> and describes the objective numerical methodology used to determine genotype cut-off values for each genetic variation.

We investigated Bartonella spp. prevalence in <b>500</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> from Campinas, Brazil, based on a cross-sectional design. Blood samples were inoculated into an enrichment liquid growth medium and sub-inoculated onto blood agar. Liquid culture samples and Gram-negative isolates were tested using a genus specific ITS PCR with amplicons sequenced for species identification. Bartonella henselae and Bartonella quintana antibodies were assayed by indirect immunofluorescence. B. henselae was isolated from six donors (1. 2 %). Sixteen donors (3. 2 %) were Bartonella-PCR positive after culture in liquid or on solid media, with 15 donors infected with B. henselae and one donor infected with Bartonella clarridgeiae.

Cellular DNA was also quantitated using qRT-PCR for beta-globin. By comparing these two results, we calculated that there were between two and five copies of HHV- 6 present per cell in these four donors. The median viral load detected in plasma from the four individuals was 3. 8 log 10 copies/ml (range 3. 5 – 4. 0 log 10 copies/ml). All samples were HHV- 6 variant B. In addition, a retrospective analysis of all diagnostic blood samples performed for HHV- 6 in our center showed a prevalence of 2. 9 % of high viral loads characteristic of integration.

Only {{a subset of}} donors is typed twice for a larger set of red cell (RBC) and/or platelet (PLT) antigens. To increase the direct availability of typed RBCs and PLTs, a high-throughput technique is being developed to genotype the whole donor cohort for all clinically relevant RBC and PLT antigens. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A multiplex polymerase chain reaction was developed to both amplify and fluorescently label 19 gene fragments of RBC and PLT antigens in one reaction. To test the setup of the genotyping method by microarray, a pilot study with human PLT antigen (HPA) -typed donor samples was performed. On each slide, 12 arrays are present containing 20 probes per PLT antigen system (28 for HPA- 3). The allele-specific oligohybridization method was used to discriminate between two different alleles.

Here, we investigated whether CCR 5 haplotypes influence HIV- 1 and HCV seropositivity among 373 Caucasian IDUs from Estonia. Of these IDUs, 56 % and 44 % were HIV and HCV seropositive, respectively, and 47 % were coinfected. <b>500</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> seronegative for HIV and HCV were also evaluated. CCR 5 haplotypes (HHA to HHG* 2) were derived after genotyping nine CCR 2 -CCR 5 polymorphisms. The association between CCR 5 haplotypes with HIV and/or HCV seropositivity was determined using logistic regression analysis. Co-variates included in the models were length of intravenous drug use, HBV serostatus and copy number of CCL 3 L 1, the gene encoding the most potent HIV-suppressive chemokine and ligand for CCR 5. Compared to IDUs seronegative for both HCV and HIV (HCV-/HIV-), IDUs who were HCV+/HIV- and HCV+/HIV+were 92 % and 82 %, respectively, less likely to possess the CCR 5 -HHG* 1 haplotype, after controlling for co-variates (P(adjusted) = 1. 89 × 10 (- 4) and 0. 003, respectively).

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown the {{existence}} of an association between celiac disease (CD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Our aim was to evaluate the usefulness of the serum anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody assay in screening for CD in consecutive NHL patients. In all, 80 consecutive patients (median age 61 years) with a new diagnosis of NHL were included. To compare the frequency of CD and of positive results for the anti-tTG assay, we enrolled <b>500</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donors.</b> In all patients serum anti-tTG was determined with two different ELISA: one based on tTG from guinea pig (gp-tTG) and the other based on human recombinant t-TG (h-tTG) as the antigens. Serum anti-endomysial antibodies (EmA) were also assayed. Subjects with positive serum EmA and/or anti-tTG underwent intestinal biopsy for histology study, HLA-DQ phenotype determination, and serum anti-gliadin (AGA) assay. Eight of 80 (10 %) NHL patients were positive for anti-tTG ELISA [...] two of these exclusively for anti-gp-tTG and six for anti-h-tTG (7. 5 %). None of the 80 NHL patients were positive for serum EmA. The frequency of anti-tTG positivity in the blood donor controls was 2 / 500 (0. 4 %), significantly lower than that observed in the NHL patients (P < 0. 0001). Both these blood donors were found to have CD. Only in one anti-h-tTG-positive NHL patient was there intestinal mucosa atrophy, and follow-up confirmed a CD diagnosis (CD frequency in NHL patients is 1. 2 %; versus blood donors: P = 0. 4). In all the other seven anti-tTG-positive NHL patients a normal intestinal architecture was found, although, inflammatory infiltration of the lamina propria was observed in four patients. No anti-tTG-positive NHL patients, including the subject diagnosed as having CD, had a family history of CD, and all had normal weight and no signs of malabsorption. Anti-tTG false positive results were associated with a higher frequency of serum autoantibody positivity and T-cell type NHL. In conclusion, NHL patients the anti-tTG assay often gives discordant data with the EmA assay, with a high frequency of anti-tTG false positive results for CD diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis G virus (HGV) is a {{recently}} discovered RNA virus, which {{belongs to the}} Flaviviridae family. Although HGV infection is usually not associated with elevated serum transaminases, some recent studies have reported that HGV infection is found in {{a significant number of}} patients with fulminant hepatitis and {{may play a role in}} its etiopathogenesis. In this study the prevalence of HGV infection was determined in 500 healthy blood donors and in 24 patients admitted to hospital because of acute liver failure caused by fulminant hepatitis. The presence of HGV RNA was tested in sera, obtained at admission and before any transfusion was given, by a sensitive seminested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay specific for detection of the non-structural (NS) 5 region. Nine of the <b>500</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> (1. 8 %) and two of the 24 patients (8. 3 %) were found to be HGV RNA positive. One patient was co-infected with HCV and was known to be an intravenous (i. v.) drug user. After intensive supporting treatment, this patient recovered completely. The second patient had no serological markers of known viral hepatitis infection, including hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). This patient was successfully transplanted. From both patients, from HGV RNA-positive healthy blood donors and from other patients coinfected with HCV, a part of the HGV NS 3 region (nucleotides 4191 - 4345, EMBL entry U 45966) was cloned and sequenced. Sequence comparison revealed that the NS 3 region of HGV in patients with fulminant hepatitis contained three nucleotide substitutions as part of the six substitutions described in previous work. These nucleotide substitutions were not found in the tested blood donors or in patients with HCV co-infection. Our findings therefore support the concept of the association of fulminant hepatitis with infection of a specific HGV strain. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Iron {{deficiency}} anemia is {{an important}} limiting factor {{for the number of}} donations in regular donors. Limited data is available on the iron status in Iranian donors. This study was conduced to evaluate the prevalence of iron deficiency and its related factors in <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> at Shiraz <b>blood</b> transfusion centre in 2005. Methods: This descriptive study was done on all <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who donated their blood at Shiraz BTO in 2005. We selected 200 first time <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> (100 female & 100 male), 200 <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of one blood donation every year for at least 3 years and 200 <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of 3 to 4 times blood donation per year. Then we filled out a questionnaire and measured Hb, ferretin, MCV and MCHC. Results: The results showed that reduction in iron stores was directly related to the number of donations. (P< 0. 05). In this study, 34 % of female first time <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> and 11. 9 % of male first time donors had decreased iron stores. 34 % of female first time <b>blood</b> <b>donors,</b> 47. 9 % of female <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> with history of one blood donation a year and 77 % of female <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of 3 time blood donations in one year had decreased levels of iron. 11. 9 % of male first time <b>blood</b> <b>donors,</b> 14. 5 % of male <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of one blood donation a year and 37. 5 % of male <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of 3 blood donations every year had iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. Conclusion: It seems that blood donation affects the iron status and if not compensated, it may cause complication in <b>blood</b> <b>donors.</b> The prevalence of iron deficiency in female <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> is more who therefore require more attention. Iron store levels are more related to number of blood donations per year rather than the number of blood donations in a lifetime. Therefore, these donors as a group require more attention...|$|R
40|$|Polymorphisms in folate pathway genes may {{influence}} the susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). DNA was isolated from 245 pediatric ALL patients (cases) and from <b>500</b> <b>blood</b> bank <b>donors</b> (controls). Polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677 C>T, 1298 A>C), methionine synthase (MTR 2756 A>G), methionine synthase reductase (MTRR 66 A>G), methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD 1 1958 G>A), nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT IVS - 151 C>T), serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT 1 1420 C>T), thymidylate synthase (TS 2 R 3 R), and the reduced folate carrier (RFC 1 80 G>A) were detected. In ALL patients, an increased occurrence was observed of the RFC 1 80 AA variant (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 1; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 3 - 3. 2; P =. 002) and the RFC 1 80 A allele (OR = 1. 5; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 2. 1; P =. 02). Likewise, the NNMT IVS - 151 TT genotype showed a 2. 2 -fold increased ALL risk (OR = 2. 2; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 4. 6; P =. 04). A 1. 4 -fold reduction in ALL risk was observed for (heterozygous or homozygous) carriers of the TS 2 R allele and the MTHFR 677 T allele (OR = 0. 7; 95 % CI, 0. 5 - 1. 0; P T and RFC 1 were observed.

Design: Cross-sectional survey using self-administered standardized structured questionnaires on both donors and non-donors. Setting: 12 mobile and 4 permanent blood donation stations in Guangzhou during the whole operation time. Participants: <b>500</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who donated at the donation sites and 500 non-donors who never donated and passed by the station {{were asked to complete}} a self-administered questionnaire during Dec 10, 2013 to Jun 25, 2014. Main outcome measures: Blood donation or no donation. Results: 1080 questionnaires were collected, of which 1034 (95. 7 %) questionnaires were valid. 602 (58. 2 %) participants were donors and 432 (41. 8 %) were non-donors. Older people (OR: 1. 46, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 24 to 1. 72, p< 0. 01), males (1. 33, CI: 1. 02 to 1. 71, p= 0. 03), non-college-students (1. 76, CI: 1. 16 to 2. 56, p< 0. 01) and people with higher education level (1. 27, CI: 1. 11 to 1. 45, p< 0. 01) {{were more likely to be}} donors. The main objective of blood donation was helping patients (n= 405, 68. 2 %), and the main reason of not donating was being in poor health (n= 138, 33. 1 %). However, other motives, such as benefiting health and free check for blood type and body, and obstacles, such as failing to meet the requirements and fear, were also important. More male donors would donate again than females (80. 5 % vs. 68. 5 %, p< 0. 01), whereas more female donors showed uncertainty than males (25. 9 % vs. 16. 6 %, p< 0. 01). Usage of blood (n= 182, 46. 7 %) was what non-donors wanted to know the most if they were to donate in the future. The majority of participants (n= 730, 71. 3 %) considered raising the awareness of blood donation among people was one of the most effective ways of blood donation promotion. Television was considered as one of the most effective methods of blood donation promotion and recruitment, and was more acceptable to females. Younger participants preferred the internet. Conclusion: These findings suggest that raising the awareness of blood donation is vital. Campaigns should focus on multiple aspects targeting different groups of people. Television and the internet are useful tools of blood donation promotion and recruitment. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: Blood {{donation}} {{results in}} a substantial loss of iron (200 to 250 mg) at each bleeding procedure (425 to 475 ml) and subsequent mobilization of iron from body stores. Recent reports have shown that body iron reserves generally are small and iron depletion is more frequent in <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> than in non-donors. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the frequency of iron deficiency in <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> and to establish the frequency of iron deficiency in <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> according to sex, whether they were first-time or multi-time donors, and the frequency of donations per year. DESIGN: From September 20 to October 5, 1999, three hundred <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> from Santa Casa Hemocenter of São Paulo were studied. DIAGNOSTIC TESTS: Using a combination of biochemical measurements of iron status: serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation index, serum ferritin and the erythrocyte indices. RESULTS: The frequency of iron deficiency in <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> was 11. 0 %, of whom 5. 5 % (13 / 237) were male and 31. 7 % (20 / 63) female donors. The frequency of iron deficiency was higher in multi-time <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> than in first-time <b>blood</b> <b>donors,</b> for male <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> (7. 6 % versus 0. 0 %, P < 0. 05) and female ones (41. 5 % versus 18. 5 %, P < 0. 05). The frequency of iron deficiency found was higher among the male <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> with three or more donations per year (P < 0. 05) and among the female <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> with two or more donations per year (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that blood donation is a very important factor for iron deficiency in <b>blood</b> <b>donors,</b> particularly in multi-time donors and especially in female donors. The high frequency of <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> with iron deficiency found in this study suggests a need for a more accurate laboratory trial, as hemoglobin or hematocrit measurement alone is not sufficient for detecting and excluding <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> with iron deficiency without anemia...|$|R
