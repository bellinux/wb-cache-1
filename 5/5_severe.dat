2500|$|As {{the ridge}} of high {{pressure}} that was located {{to the south}} of the cyclone started to weaken, which meant that Susan started to move further towards the southwest. RSMC Nadi then reported at 0000UTC on January 5, that the system had become a category <b>5</b> <b>severe</b> tropical cyclone with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 140mph (220km/h), before reporting 6 hours later that Susan had reached its peak 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 145mph (225km/h) and a peak pressure of 900hPa (26.58inHg). Around this time RSMC Nadi reported that the system might of developed a double eye feature while the JTWC reported that Susan had peaked with 1-minute wind speeds of 260km/h (160mph) equivalent to a weak category five hurricane on the SSHS. As the system reached its peak intensity, Susan was moving towards the southwest and as a result, it [...] "posed a severe threat to Vanuatu," [...] however during that afternoon, Susan recurved towards the southeast [...] "just in time to spare Vanuatu, a direct hit.” After turning away from Vanuatu, Susan accelerated towards the southeast while remaining near or at its peak intensities, before starting to weaken significantly during January 7. RSMC Nadi then reported early the next day, that Susan had weakened into a category 4 severe tropical cyclone while it was located about , to the southeast of Nadi, Fiji, which was close enough for the system to produce gale force winds in several southern and western Fijian Islands. By 0000UTC on January 9, Susan had completely absorbed Cyclone Ron, before the final advisories on the combined system, were released later that day as it lost its tropical characteristics and became extratropical. The remnants of the combined system were then monitored for another day, until they were last noted during January 10, bringing an unseasonable cold snap to New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|After {{being named}} Beni {{executed}} a small clockwise loop {{for two days}} to the southeast of Rennell, partially {{as a result of}} a strong surface ridge of high pressure to the south of the low level circulation center. Environmental conditions surrounding the system also fluctuated during 25 January, as a result of Beni's position to the north of the strongly diffluent flow on the northern side of the upper-level ridge axis. As a result, the systems low level circulation center became partially exposed with deep convection located to the west of the system before Beni's low level circulation slipped back under the convection during 26 January, with spiral bands wrapping tightly around the centre. As a result, RSMC Nadi reported that the system had developed into a category 2 tropical cyclone during that day. Over the next two days conditions continued to fluctuate with shear playing a significant role in holding back further intensification of the system. Early on 28 January as a ragged eye and cloud filled eye appeared on satellite imagery, the JTWC reported that the system had become equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). When the data was reanalyzed, RSMC Nadi reported that Beni had become a category 3 severe tropical cyclone at this time, however, operationally it wasn't declared a category 3 severe tropical cyclone for another 18 hours. Throughout 28 January Beni continued to intensify before the JTWC reported early the next day that the system had peaked, with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 230km/h (145mph) which made it equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the SSHS.

Methods In this study, we evaluated DPYD promoter methylation through quantitative methylation-specific PCR and screened DPYD for large intragenic rearrangements in peripheral blood from 45 patients with gastrointestinal cancers who developed <b>severe</b> <b>5</b> -FU toxicity. DPYD promoter methylation was also assessed in tumor tissue from 29 patients Results Two cases with the IVS 14 + 1 G > A exon 14 skipping mutation (c. 1905 + 1 G > A), and one case carrying the 1845 G > T missense mutation (c. 1845 G > T) in the DPYD gene were identified. However, DPYD promoter methylation and large DPYD intragenic rearrangements were absent in all cases analyzed. Conclusions Our results indicate that DPYD promoter methylation and large intragenic rearrangements do not contribute significantly to the development of <b>5</b> -FU <b>severe</b> toxicity in gastrointestinal cancer patients, supporting the need for additional studies on the mechanisms underlying genetic susceptibility to <b>severe</b> <b>5</b> -FU toxicity. </p...|$|R
