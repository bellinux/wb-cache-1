40|$|This {{investigation}} {{involved the}} fabrication and testing to {{failure of a}} large number of nominally identical reinforced concrete members such as 20 simple beams, 20 two-span continuous beam and 20 columns. The simple beams were of rectangular section 5 " wide by 8 " deep with 2 -# <b>5</b> <b>bars</b> as tension reinforcement only. The simple beams were loaded to failure using equal loads at the third points. The two-span continuous beams, also of rectangular section 5 " x 8 " had both tension (2 -# <b>5</b> <b>bars)</b> and compression (2 -# <b>5</b> <b>bars)</b> reinforcement, equal loads were applied at the centre of each span. The column was rectangular in section (6 " x 6 ") with symetrical reinforcement of 4 -# <b>5</b> <b>bars.</b> The column was loaded to failure by an eccentric load. The distribution of load carrying capacity of the members was determined by finding the joint probability of a given concrete strength and steel yield stress occurring and calculating the ultimate load using a prediction formulae. From the comparison of the results, it was found that the experimentally determined mean strength of the beams and columns were in good agreement with the ultimate loads which were calculated from the prediction formulae of the National Building Cade of Canada and the building code requirement of the American Concrete Institute. From the predicted distribution of ultimate load capacity the probability of the ultimate load being less than the design load was determined. Using the &phis; factors recommended by the NBC. The probability of failure for the columns was less than 0. 01 % and 7 % for the beams...|$|R
40|$|Objective The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{effectiveness}} of three dHferent treatment protocols of low-energy radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy for management of chronic plantar fasciitis. Subjects The study was double-blind randomized study. Forty five adult subjects were randomly divided into three equal groups (I, II & III). Methods The treatment group (I) received 2000 impulses with 2. <b>5</b> <b>bars</b> and frequency of 8 Hz, group (II) received 3500 impulses with 3 - 3. <b>5</b> <b>bars</b> and frequency of 8 Hz while group (III) received 1000 impulses with 1. <b>5</b> <b>bars</b> and frequency of 4. 8 Hz. All groups received total 3 sessions given at weekly interval. Pain and function of foot were measured at baseline, after 3 weeks of treatment and after 6 weeks of follow up after the end of the treatment by visual analog scale and ankle-hind foot scale respectively. Results The results revealed significant reduction of pain and improvement in function of the foot in all treated groups (I, II & III) (P<. 0. 0001), significant difference in pain and function scores between group I & III as well as between group II & III and negative correlation between pain and function of the foot (r=-. 44) after 6 weeks follow up. Conclusion Radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy significantly improves pain and foot function. The delivery of low-energy radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy 3 sessions given at weekly interval with 2000 impulses, 2. <b>5</b> <b>bars</b> and frequency of 8 Hz is the most effective treatment protocol in terms of relieving pain and restoring the functional activity of people suffering from chronic plantar fasciitis...|$|R

5000|$|In {{dimensional}} analysis, a ratio which converts {{one unit}} of measure into another without changing the quantity is called a conversion factor. For example, kPa and bar are both units of pressure, and 100 kPa = 1 bar. The rules of algebra allow both sides of an equation to be divided by the same expression, so this is equivalent to 100 kPa / 1 bar = 1. Since any quantity can be multiplied by 1 without changing it, the expression [...] "100 kPa / 1 bar" [...] {{can be used to}} convert from bars to kPa by multiplying it with the quantity to be converted, including units. For example, <b>5</b> <b>bar</b> × 100 kPa / 1 bar = 500 kPa because 5 × 100 / 1 = 500, and bar/bar cancels out, so <b>5</b> <b>bar</b> = 500 kPa.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{low and high}} {{relative}} humidity and of polyethylene glycol-induced root water stress on chlorophyll accumulation, on formation of the lamellar chlorophyll-protein complexes, and {{on the development of}} photosynthetic activity during chloroplast differentiation were examined. Low relative humidity or polyethylene glycol-induced root water stress (stress conditions) resulted in a 3 to 4 hour lag in chlorophyll accumulation, retarded the rate of chlorophyll b accumulation, and reduced the rate of formation of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein. All of these effects could be overcome by high relative humidity (nonstress) conditions. Concomitant measurement of leaf water potential showed that under stress conditions greening leaves were subjected to initial water deficits of − 8 bars which decreased to − <b>5</b> <b>bars</b> after 3 to 4 hours of illumination corresponding {{to the end of the}} lag phase. Leaves greening under nonstress conditions did not experience leaf water deficits greater than about − <b>5</b> <b>bars.</b> It seems that the attainment of a minimum leaf water potential of − <b>5</b> <b>bars</b> may be critical in the control of early chloroplast development. These results demonstrate that the lag phase is not indicative of a programmed event in chloroplast development, but rather is attributable to environmental conditions prevailing during leaf development and greening...|$|R
