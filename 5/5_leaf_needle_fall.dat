30|$|Significant {{differences}} in fungal assemblages {{as a function}} of needle age were also obtained using permutational multivariate analysis of variance. From PERMANOVA, pairwise differences were indicated between 1 -year-old <b>needles</b> and <b>fallen</b> <b>needles</b> (P[*]=[*] 0.0128) and between 2 -year-old <b>needles</b> and <b>fallen</b> <b>needles</b> (P[*]=[*] 0.0022), with marginal evidence of an assemblage difference between 3 -year-old <b>needles</b> and <b>fallen</b> <b>needles</b> (P[*]=[*] 0.0584). Using CAP was an alternative method of testing whether or not the multivariate means are different for the four different age classes. Results were unequivocal in indicating a significant difference between age classes (P[*]=[*] 0.0181 (trace test) or 0.006 (test based on the first squared canonical correlation)), with eight out of the 11 <b>fallen</b> <b>needle</b> samples being correctly classified, i.e. placed in the correct needle class by the cross-validation procedure of CAP. However, no 1 -year-old needle sample was correctly classified; only two of the eight 2 -year-old needle samples and only two of the eight 3 -year-old needle samples were correctly classified. This indicates that <b>fallen</b> <b>needles</b> have a different fungal assemblage to those of the three age classes, with their OTUs being more distinct than those in the needles retained by the trees. The widespread species L. pinastri was present in 14 of the cloning samples, nine of which were in <b>fallen</b> <b>needles.</b> The sites at which L. pinastri was not present in the <b>fallen</b> <b>needle</b> sample were Tower Hill, Styx and Branches Creek, the three driest sites.|$|R

40|$|The purpose this {{research}} is to study the parameters of <b>leaf</b> (<b>needle)</b> share in the trees’ greenery fraction {{and the content of}} absolutely dry matter in fresh leaves of black locust and Scots pine. The <b>leaf</b> (<b>needle)</b> share in the trees greenery fraction and the content of absolutely dry matter were determined by their quantitative measures (weight and volume). The results of the research reveal that the leaf share in the structure of a tree’s greenery fraction has a broad range of values: 43. 0 – 72. 8 % for black locust and 49. 1 – 75. 4 % for Scots pine. The minimum value of this parameter was recorded for an overmature Robinia specimen of 41 years of age, while the maximum was for a 3 -year-old tree. For pine trees the lowest values of the given parameter were registered for the spcimens aged 38, 49 and 84, the maximum – for 30 – 31 -year-old trees. For both investigated species {{it should be noted that}} there is a consistent pattern indicated by the following trend line: with the increase of tree age, height and trunk diameter, there is a decrease of leaf share value in the trees’ greenery fraction. Such characteristic parameter as absolutely dry mass has a sufficient range of values from 0. 321 to 0. 524, with the extreme values for the trees belonging to the young stock group in the case of the black locust. The absolutely dry matter content in Scots pine needles showed a significant variability of values from 0. 426 to 0. 620. The trend line shows a tendency of increase in the value of absolutely dry matter mass in the leaves of both investigated species with the increase in the values of the tree taxation parameters. There is no statistically proven dependency of the parameter indicating leaf share in the trees greenery fraction on the age, trunk diameter and height of trees. The most important biometric indicator, which shows a moderate relationship with the greenery fraction of a tree is the average diameter of the trunk of model trees of the two studied species. This is confirmed by values of correlation coefficients. The indicator of greenery fraction is inversely dependent on the height, trunk diameter and tree age, i. e. the increase in the values of these parameters leads to the decrease in the share of the photosynthetic active component of  trees of the studied tree species in the steppe zone. The value of <b>leaf</b> (<b>needle)</b> share in trees’ greenery fraction decreases with the increasing age, height and diameter values, which is quite natural. Correlation indices of absolutely dry matter according to age, height and diameter of sample trees have negative values, while the index of <b>leaf</b> (<b>needle)</b> share of trees’ greenery fraction has a direct correlation with all the studied influence factors...|$|R

The observed rise and subsequent fall of numbers of yg_ mutations can be accounted for by a model in which the decline of the curves is due to cell killing which may also be due to chromosome breakage and deletion. The interpretation is based on the principles of the dual action theory, which explains radiobiological action in terms of microdosimetry. One of the observations accounted for is the higher maximum mutation rate for X-rays as compared to neutrons. ...|$|R
