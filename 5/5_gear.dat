40|$|Pitting due to {{rolling contact}} fatigue {{is a complex}} {{phenomenon}} and several factors influence its occurrence, particularly under lubricated conditions. A deeper understanding of pit formation mechanisms is {{needed in order to}} effectively evaluate the pitting behaviour of different lubricants. The present work focuses on investigating the events that lead to pit formation in the lubricated rolling four -ball test by analysing surface degradation, wear mode, material changes and crack initiation sites etc. These investigations have been conducted using two API - GL <b>5</b> <b>gear</b> oils. These analyses of pitted balls revealed the formation of a low hardness region {{beneath the surface of the}} rolling track due to martensite decay. The formation rate and expans ion of this region was found to differ for the two lubricating oils. Examination of the pitted ball has also indicated that the initial rolling contact fatigue cracks were initiated at or close to the surface. Godkänd; 2012; 20120830 (andbra...|$|E
40|$|Vehicle {{manufacturers}} today face increasing {{demands to}} produce fuel efficient vehicles. If {{this is to}} be successfully achieved, the reduction of energy losses is vital [1]. One approach to loss reduction is to use lower viscosity trans mission fluids to reduce splash (churning) losses in the drive-train. However, this introduces potential problems in regard to the durability of machine components due to reduction in oil film thickness [2]. As regards gear transmission, the durability is mainly related to the formation of micropits on parts of gears where sliding is high, which later lead to pitting damage. The formation of micropits is due to surface stress which can be reduced by fluids that form thick EHD films or reduce sliding friction. In order to determine if these same lubricant properties as well as other parameters, known to influence the fuel efficiency of axle lubricants, also affect contact fatigue damage in rolling contacts, an extensive experimental study using a rolling four ball test was performed. The tests were performed with a series of fluids that form thin and thick EHD films and have low and high sliding friction. Additionally, these fluids have been formulated to hav e high and low hydrodynamic friction. All these fluids contai ned additive packages that meet the API GL- <b>5</b> <b>gear</b> oil specifications. The different properties of the lubricating fluids were controlled by changes to the base oils as well as addition of friction modifiers. The results have shown that it is possible do distinguish the pitting properties of the different lubricants by using rolling four ball tests. A multiple linear regression statistical analysis was performed with the use of Matlab for evaluating the results obtained from rolling four ball tests. The statistical model developed, showed that some of the physical properties of fluids that a ffect fuel efficiency have an impact on pitting performance of the lubricants. The ball test specimens from rolling four ball tests have been analyzed by using SEM/ EDS and XPS in order to characterize the tribochemical films and understand the damage mechanisms.

This is an external temperature control system and can be replaced by any system you may have available. Extruder calibration To ensure the stepper movement translates into the piston movement accordingly to the g-code, it needs to be calibrated properly. Calibration set-up In principle, the calibration set-up requires: CNC control of the piston powering motor (we use Nema 11 with a planetary reductor) the assembled extruder (at least the moving parts) a precise displacement measurement device (calipers, etc., high precision indicators are preferrable) The calibration protocol requires a set-up, where the piston translation, can be precisely measured in the axis of extrusion. For this purpose, the measurement device is fixed on the extruder in a way, that the extruder movement is translated directly into the measurement. Calibration procedure adjust the steps/unit value of the motor settings in the cnc control software (or use default values) command piston movement for an exact distance measure the real movement distance and compare repeat steps 1 - 3, until the g-code value coincides with the measured value For a Nema 11 motor (with a planetary reductor) + an M 5 spindle (0. 5 mm pitch/rotation), the default STEPS/UNIT value is 37914. 30. Thermistor calibration Every thermistor analog output values have to be mapped to actual temperature values via an equation. Every thermistor needs to be calibrated as described in this section. EQUIPMENT: thermo block/plate (heat source), alcochol thermometer, thermistor, setup for reading analog signal from the thermistor, oil, glass. pour a small glass of oil (50 mL or so) place the glass on the heat source fit a thermistor to the alcochol thermometer sink the thermistor - thermometer setup into the glass with oil prepare the system to read analog values turn on the heat source and record sensor analog output at every 1 °C increment plot data (x - axis: analog output, y-axis: real temperature) fit the best trendline to the data obtained (MATLAB or EXCEL are good tools for completing this task but there are also others) software will yield a fit line equation which then has to be transcribed into microcontroller firmware (we used Arduino Mega) Now your thermistor will give out the right temperature values. step_vitaprint. zi...|$|E
