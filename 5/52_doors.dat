50|$|Scout Hall (also {{known as}} Scote Hall) at Shibden near Halifax, West Yorkshire, England, {{was built in}} 1681 for John Mitchell (1659-1696), who had {{inherited}} great wealth as a silk merchant. Mitchell was castigated by the preacher Oliver Heywood for his dissolute way of life, spending his money on horse racing and drink. The house is a 'calendar' building, supposedly of 12 bays, with <b>52</b> <b>doors</b> and 365 panes of glass. It is Grade II* listed but is on the English Heritage 'buildings at risk' register.|$|E
40|$|Data for the {{probability}} that a doors are open or closed {{in the event of a}} fire is sparse. The literature only presents a snap-shot rather than how the position of the door has changed over time. This paper describes the development of a low-cost, unobtrusive logging device that can continuously monitor the position of a door for extended periods. The devices were used to record 180 days of data from <b>52</b> <b>doors</b> located in different types of sleeping occupancies: hotels, apartments, dormitories and rest homes. Results were obtained for {{the probability}} that doors were open during day-time and night-time; and also during weekdays and weekends. Overall a probability distribution for the fraction of time that a door was found to be open is an inverse Gaussian function with mean µ = 0. 104 and shape factor l = 0. 0117...|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Navy {{followed}} suit in 1979, ordering {{a version of}} the Super King Air A200C (modified with a 52 inch by <b>52</b> inch cargo <b>door</b> from the Super King Air 200C), designating it the UC-12B, for logistics support between Naval and Marine Corps air stations, air facilities, and other activities, both in CONUS and overseas. The cabin can readily accommodate cargo, passengers or both. It is also equipped to accept litter patients in medical evacuation missions. Through 1982, the Navy ordered 64 of these aircraft.|$|R

Those which form the cheeks of the windows are generally selected with more care from the débris of some rock, which is naturally smooth and polished, after being subjected to the weather, such as granite or syenite. The window itself is narrow and deep set; in the better sort of cottages, latticed, but with no affectation of sweetbrier or eglantine about it. It may be observed of {{the whole of the}} cottage, that, though all is beautiful, nothing is pretty. The roof is rather flat, and covered with heavy fragments of the stone of which the walls are built, originally very loose; but generally cemented by accumulated soil, and bound together by houseleek, moss, and stonecrop: brilliant in color, and singular in abundance. The form of the larger cottages, being frequently that of a cross, would hurt the eye by the sharp angles of the roof, {{were it not for the}} cushion-like vegetation with which they are rounded and concealed. Varieties of the fern sometimes relieve the massy forms of the stonecrop, with their light and delicate leafage. Windows in the roof are seldom met with. Of the chimney I shall speak hereafter.|$|R
