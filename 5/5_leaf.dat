50|$|Only a few {{diseases}} and pests {{are known to}} attack proso millet, {{but they are not}} economically important. Weeds are a bigger problem. The critical phase is in juvenile development. The formation of the grains happens in the 3, up to <b>5,</b> <b>leaf</b> stadium. After that, all nutrients should be available for the millet, so it is necessary to prevent the growth of weeds. In conventional farming, herbicides may be used. In organic farming it is possible to use harrow weeders and interrow cultivators, but special sowing parameters described in the chapter above are needed.For good crop development, fertilization with 50 to 75 kg nitrogen per hectare is recommended. Planting proso millet in a crop rotation after maize should be avoided due to its same weed spectrum. Because proso millet is an undemanding crop, it may be used {{at the end of the}} rotation.|$|E
40|$|Dry maize seeds, of {{a genetic}} stock {{heterozygous}} for the yellow-green locus (Yg^ Λ ^) ι were irradiated with fission neutron doses up to 2700 rads and with 250 kVp X-rays to 40 000 rads. The frequency of yellow-green (yg) sectors in seedling leaves 4 and 5 {{is largely a}} measure of the frequency of breakage (or incomplete exchange) and loss of the part of the short arm of chromosome I X carrying Yj>. Plots of dose versus yj* sector frequency per leaf show a linear increase with neutrons which reaches a maximum (leaf 4 = S. <b>5,</b> <b>leaf</b> 5 = 2. 5) followed by a rapid decline; and a curvilinear increase with X-rays reaching a higher maximum (leaf 4 = 8. <b>5,</b> <b>leaf</b> 5 = 3. 6) followed by a decrease. The observed rise and subsequent fall of numbers of yg_ mutations can be accounted for by a model in which the decline of the curves is due to cell killing which may also be due to chromosome breakage and deletion. The interpretation is based on the principles of the dual action theory, which explains radiobiological action in terms of microdosimetry. One of the observations accounted for is the higher maximum mutation rate for X-rays as compared to neutrons. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the {{experiments}} was to evaluate zinc (Zn) fertilization effect on growth, yield and yield components of corn silage grown on a sandy soil under field and outdoor container conditions. Six rates of Zn supply (0 or control; 1. 5; 3; 5; 10 and 50 mgkg− 1) were tested. They were split at three different times during the growing season: (i) 50 % immediately after sowing, (ii) 25 % at 4 – <b>5</b> <b>leaf</b> stage and (iii) 25 % at 8 – 9 leaf stage. These Zn rates were applied to the soil surface as a solution of Zn sulfate (ZnSO 4 · 7 H 2 O). Zn deficiency symptoms appeared at an earlier stage (4 – <b>5</b> <b>leaf</b> stage) as white stripes between the midrib and the margin of leaves for a Zn rate below or equal to 5 mgkg− 1. Severity of these symptoms manifested more in container than in field. For both experiments, Zn supply induced {{a significant increase in}} stem height and leaf area. Furthermore, in both experiments, control plants showed a notable delay in achieving anthesis, silking, pollination and kernels maturity. The maximum shoot dry weight at harvest was recorded with Zn supply of 5 mgkg− 1 in field experiment and 10 mgkg− 1 in containers experiment. The shoot dry weight was especially linked to kernels dry weight. This latter was mainly enhanced through two compounds: 1000 kernels dry weight and pollination rate. On the other hand, outdoor container results can be used to help predict field plant responses to Zn except for control treatment...|$|E
40|$|The 636 -bp-long cDNA {{sequence}} of OsCu/Zn-SOD (AK 059841) was cloned from Oryza sativa var. Longjing 11 via reverse transcription {{polymerase chain reaction}} (RT-PCR). The encoded protein comprised of 211 amino acids is highly homologous to Cu/Zn-SOD proteins from tuscacera rice and millet. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that in rice, the level of OsCu/Zn-SOD gene expression was lowest in roots and was highest in petals and during the S <b>5</b> <b>leaf</b> stage. Moreover, the expression level of OsCu/Zn-SOD gene expression decreased during the L <b>5</b> <b>leaf</b> stage to maturity. The level of OsCu/Zn-SOD gene expression, however, was increased under saline-sodic stress and NaHCO 3 stress. Germination tests under 125, 150, and 175 mM NaCl revealed that OsCu/Zn-SOD-overexpressing lines performed better than the non-transgenic (NT) Longjing 11 lines in terms of germination rate and height. Subjecting seedlings to NaHCO 3 and water stress revealed that OsCu/Zn-SOD-overexpressing lines performed better than NT in terms of SOD activity, fresh weight, root length, and height. Under simulated NaHCO 3 stress, OsCu/Zn-SOD-overexpressing lines performed better than NT in terms of survival rate (25. 19 % > 6. 67 %) and yield traits (average grain weight 20. 6 > 18. 15 g). This study showed that OsCu/Zn-SOD gene overexpression increases the detoxification capacity of reactive oxygen species in O. sativa and reduces salt-induced oxidative damage. We also revealed the regulatory mechanism of OsCu/Zn-SOD enzyme in saline-sodic stress resistance in O. sativa. Moreover, we provided an experimental foundation for studying the mechanism of OsCu/Zn-SOD enzymes in the chloroplast...|$|E
