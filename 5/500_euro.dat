25|$|The Bank of Canada, Canada's sole issuer of bank notes, {{currently}} issues {{five different}} denominations ($5, $10, $20, $50 and $100). Smaller denominations {{have been replaced}} by coins, and larger ones are felt to be no longer required in an era of electronic transmission of most large transactions. Despite competition from some more valuable foreign notes (most notably, the <b>500</b> <b>euro</b> banknote), there are no plans to re-issue Canadian banknotes larger than $100.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the great}} number of {{historic}} bridges, arches, and gateways throughout the European continent, all the structures represented on the notes are entirely stylised illustrations of the relevant architectural styles, designed to evoke the landmarks within the European Union, representing various European ages and styles. For example, the 5 euro note has a generic rendition of Classical architecture, the 10 euro note of Romanesque architecture, the 20 euro note of Gothic architecture, the 50 euro note of the Renaissance, the 100 euro note of Baroque and Rococo, the 200 euro note of Art Nouveau and the <b>500</b> <b>euro</b> note of modern architecture. The initial designs by Robert Kalina were of actual bridges, including the Rialto Bridge in Venice and the Pont de Neuilly in Paris, and were subsequently rendered more generic. In 2011, Dutch artist Robin Stam {{and the town of}} Spijkenisse in the Netherlands built seven bridges of colored concrete after the designs on the seven euro banknotes.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{degradation}} {{in the value}} of the U.S. $100 banknote (which was worth more in 1969 than a U.S. $500 note would be worth today), and despite competition from some more valuable foreign notes (most notably, the <b>500</b> <b>euro</b> banknote), there are no plans to re-issue banknotes above $100. The widespread use of electronic means to conduct high-value transactions today has made large-scale physical cash transactions obsolete and therefore, from the government's point of view, unnecessary for the conduct of legitimate business.
