5|$|On Sunday, March 3, Maria Freitta, {{the owner}} of the dog and the playmate of Barker, went with her mother to a vacant, newly built ranch house next door to her home. It was on 433 2nd Ave, owned by her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Pat Vecchia. Maria managed to open a 3 ft × <b>5</b> <b>ft</b> bedroom closet's door, and her missing dog bounded out of the closet and leaped happily at her. Also in the closet was Barker, dead, in a seated position, the hood of her blue coat {{partially}} covering her blonde hair. She was found in the same clothes she had on when she disappeared. Bits of fur from her hat were rubbed off. Police Chief Edward Garrity stated he believed that Barker had recently been placed in the closet as the puppy had been fed recently, and there was no animal waste in the closet despite the dog not being housebroken.|$|E
5|$|On the Texas coast, Arlene {{produced}} a small storm surge peaking at 4 ft (1.2 m) in some areas, breaching sections of Padre Island and causing flooding. The storm tide also eroded up to a foot (0.3 m) of sand from beaches {{in the lower}} Texas coast. Combined with the heavy rainfall associated with Arlene, the storm surge produced significant tidal flooding in some coastal stretches. Beach erosion occurred {{as far north as}} Galveston Bay, where tides were reported to be as high as <b>5</b> <b>ft</b> (1.5 m). A woman was swept into the sea off a jetty near Freeport and required rescue by United States Coast Guard. Over the waters of Lake Corpus Christi, a large funnel cloud was reported but never touched down or caused any damage. Nearby, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Causeway was completely inundated {{with the exception of one}} lane, prompting an extensive study of possible solutions to raising the causeway nearly two years later.|$|E

In addition, performance of pigs fed an antibiotic (ASP 250) versus no antibiotic at each space allowance was evaluated. The pigs fed an antibiotic gained significantly faster than pigs receiving no antibiotic; however, most of the improvements were observed {{the first three weeks}} of the five week trial. Maximum growth was observed at 2. <b>5</b> sq. <b>ft.</b> and 3. <b>5</b> sq. <b>ft.</b> of space allowance. Pigs given 1. <b>5</b> sq. <b>ft.</b> gained slightly slower throughout the trial.

25|$|As Engström {{had a lot}} {{of earlier}} {{experience}} about rolling stock, his contribution on company's railway wagon building was significant. Wagon building balanced the wintertime pits in demand. The main customer was Finnish State Railways and the other customers were private railway operators with the standard <b>5</b> <b>ft</b> and narrow gauges. The company produced mainly freight wagons, but also some passenger coaches. The wagon production was ended in 1916, by when the company had built 1,980 closed and 963 open freight wagons and 80 coaches. This makes Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works the second biggest producer of railway wagons in Finland until then, right after the State Railways' Engineering Works.|$|E
25|$|Work on {{the site}} of Mission San Jose {{commenced}} in May 1797 by Native American people from Mission Santa Clara, 13 miles to the south, under direction of Franciscan missionaries and secular Hispanic overseers. The location, on slopes overlooking the Fremont plain {{on the east side of}} San Francisco Bay, had been inhabited for countless generations by Indians who spoke the San Francisco Bay Ohlone language. The Ohlone lived a hunting and wild-plant harvesting lifestyle. Their food included seeds, roots, berries, the flour from acorns, small game, deer, fish, and shellfish. In 1797 most of the Indians, from the immediate vicinity of the mission site had actually already been baptized at Mission Santa Clara, 13 miles to the south, during the 1780s and early 1790s. It was these people who returned home to form the founding population of the new community. (Milliken 2008) Mission San José's walls were <b>5</b> <b>ft</b> thick.|$|E

He had clear, bright eyes... His teeth were wide apart, small, and ill-kept; his hair was slightly curly and inclined to golden; his eyebrows met. His ears were of moderate size, and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent ever so slightly inward. His complexion was between dark and fair. He was short of stature, although Julius Marathus, his freedman and keeper of his records, says that he was five feet and nine inches (just under <b>5</b> <b>ft.</b> 7 in., or 1.70 meters, in modern height measurements), but this was concealed by the fine proportion and symmetry of his figure, and was noticeable only by comparison with some taller person standing beside him...", adding that [...] "his shoes [...] somewhat high-soled, to make him look taller than he really was" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{hurricane}} {{passed to}} the west of the Florida Keys as a Category 4 hurricane.

Rainfall from the hurricane's outer bands was intermittent, and storm tides of <b>5</b> <b>ft</b> (1.5 m) were reported. Further north, Captiva and Sanibel islands were completely inundated with water. In Punta Rassa, the majority of homes were either extensively damaged or washed away. Most highways leading out of Fort Myers were impassible due to high water. Damage to railroad tracks resulted in a suspension of service for three days. On Estero Island, a number of buildings were damaged, including the casinos, cottages, and Crescent Beach resort. The storm also destroyed the mausoleum of Dr. Cyrus Teed, the founder of Koreshanity. Damage in Lee County reached about $1.5 million. Along the Myakka River near Boca Grande, the railroad bridge washed away, while the storm also destroyed two vehicular bridges over the Charlotte Harbor Bay. The streets of Punta Gorda were inundated, where a tide of [...] above normal was recorded. One death occurred in the city due to drowning. At Egmont Key, above normal tides forced 75 people to seek shelter in the lighthouse. The entire island was inundated by water.|$|E

6000|$|There was a {{very fair}} scuffle all round the booking-office, and Golightly {{received}} a nasty cut over his eye through falling against a table. But the constables were too much for him, and they and the Station-Master handcuffed him securely. As soon as the mail-bag was slipped, he began expressing his opinions, and the head-constable said:--"Without doubt this is the soldier- Englishman we required. Listen to the abuse!"

He said that no Lieutenant could look such a ruffian as did Golightly, and that his instructions were to send his capture under proper escort to Umritsar. Golightly was feeling very damp and uncomfortable, and the language he used was not fit for publication, even in an expurgated form. The four constables saw him safe to Umritsar in an [...] "intermediate" [...] compartment, and he spent the four-hour journey in abusing them as fluently as his knowledge of the vernaculars allowed.|$|E
60|$|Apropos {{of animals}} burying their treasures (or connections) for safety, {{it is worth}} {{mentioning}} that the skunk of the pampas occasionally buries her young in the kennel, when hunger compels her to go out foraging. I had often heard of this habit of the female skunk from the gauchos, and one day had the rare good fortune to witness an animal engaged in obliterating her own kennel. The senses of the skunk are so defective that one is able at times to approach very near to without alarming them. In this instance I sat on my horse {{at a distance of}} twenty yards, and watched the animal at work, drawing in the loose earth with her fore feet until the entrance to the kennel was filled up to within three inches of the surface; then, dropping into the shallow cavity, she pressed the loose mould down with her nose. Her task finished, she trotted away, and the hollow in the soil, when I examined it closely, looked only like the mouth of an ancient choked-up burrow. The young inhabit a circular chamber, lined with fine dry grass, {{at the end of a}} narrow passage from 3 ft. to <b>5</b> <b>ft.</b> long, and no doubt have air enough to serve them until their parent returns; but I believe the skunk only buries her young when they are very small.|$|E
