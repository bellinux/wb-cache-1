50|$|Model studies {{indicate}} that PG2 (but not specific antigens or IgE cross-linkage) stimulates mouse and human mast cells to release histamine by an EP3-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, EP3-deficient mice fail to develop increased capillary permeability and tissue swelling in response to EP3 receptor agonists and the metabolic precursor to PGE2, arachidonic acid. It is suggested, based on these and other less direct studies, that PGE2-EP3 signaling {{may be responsible for}} the skin swelling and edema provoked by topical <b>5-aminolaevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> photodynamic therapy, contact with chemical irritants, infection with pathogens, and various skin disorders in humans.|$|E
50|$|Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) {{is used as}} a {{cofactor}} in {{a number}} of enzyme-catalysed reactions in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. The biosynthetic pathway to adenosylcobalamin from its five-carbon precursor, <b>5-aminolaevulinic</b> <b>acid,</b> can be divided into three sections: (1) the biosynthesis of uroporphyrinogen III from 5-aminolaevulinic acid; (2) the conversion of uroporphyrinogen III into the ring-contracted, deacylated intermediate precorrin 6 or cobalt-precorrin 6; and (3) the transformation of this intermediate to form adenosylcobalamin. Cobalamin is synthesised by bacteria and archaea via two alternative routes that differ primarily in the steps of section 2 that lead to the contraction of the macrocycle and excision of the extruded carbon molecule (and its attached methyl group). One pathway (exemplified by Pseudomonas denitrificans) incorporates molecular oxygen into the macrocycle as a prerequisite to ring contraction, and has consequently been termed the aerobic pathway. The alternative, anaerobic, route (exemplified by Salmonella typhimurium) takes advantage of a chelated cobalt ion, in the absence of oxygen, to set the stage for ring contraction.|$|E
