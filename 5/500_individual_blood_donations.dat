40|$|During {{each of the}} {{four-year}} periods 1971 - 1975 and 1975 - 1979, the annual incidence of hepatitis B infection has been assessed in 56 patients with haemophilia A by measuring plasma HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc levels. Infection rates of 7 % and 9. 5 % per annum respectively were observed for each four-year period despite the screening of <b>individual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donations</b> for HBsAg by techniques up to the sensitivity of reversed passive haemagglutination. The highest incidence of seroconversion was amongst severe haemophiliacs {{many of whom had}} received treatment predominantly with cryoprecipitate. Of the 16 patients in whom serological evidence of hepatitis B infection was obtained only one had an accompanying clinical episode of hepatitis.

40|$|AbstractNew {{adult stem}} cell sources, devoid of the technical/ethical/economical {{barriers}} of those presently available, would favor the ongoing development of in vitro cell engineering and transplantation. Hematopoietic transplantation opened the way to and remains the most successful cell transplantation procedure. CD 34 + cells that include hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic progenitors (HPs) are presently harvested from bone marrow (BM), cord blood or peripheral blood (after being mobilized from BM). The panel of potential donors, the quantities of collected cells and some other technical/medical problems still represent limiting factors to their transplantation in some patients. Steady state peripheral blood (SSPB) contains very low frequencies of CD 34 + cells. They are trapped in leukoreduction filters (LRFs), which are discarded after the preparation of therapeutic red blood cell concentrates from <b>individual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donations.</b> We recently developed a procedure allowing the easy and rapid elution of CD 34 + cells from LRFs and we showed that they are functionally similar to those harvested from other sources. After providing {{an overview of the}} sources, interests and limitations of therapeutic HSCs presently available, we will provide arguments based on our and others' results suggesting that SSPB could become an attractive source of HSCs for hematopoietic transplantation and of other cell types for various research/development procedures...|$|R

50|$|Haemophilia is {{considered}} the best test of the HIV-AIDS hypothesis by both denialists and AIDS researchers. While Duesberg claims AIDS in haemophiliacs is caused by contaminated clotting factors and HIV is a harmless passenger virus, this result is contradicted by large studies on haemophiliac patients who received contaminated blood. A comparison of groups receiving high, medium {{and low levels of}} contaminated clotting factors found the death rates differed significantly depending on HIV status. Of 396 HIV positive haemophiliacs followed between 1985 and 1993, 153 died. The comparative figure for the HIV negative group was one out of 66, despite comparable doses of contaminated clotting factors. A comparison of <b>individuals</b> receiving <b>blood</b> <b>donations</b> also supports the results; in 1994 there were 6888 individuals with AIDS who had their HIV infection traced to blood transfusions. Since the introduction of HIV testing, the number of individuals whose AIDS status can be traced to blood transfusions was only 29 (as of 1994).|$|R

40|$|Charles M Harmon, Laura L Cooling Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA Abstract: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a {{pervasive}} DNA virus that infects {{a significant portion}} of individuals worldwide, and may be transmitted through the transfusion of blood products. Although CMV infection is of little consequence in immunocompetent individuals, patients with an impaired immune system are at risk of significant morbidity and mortality. Unlike other blood-borne infectious agents, it is impractical to defer all CMV-positive <b>individuals</b> from <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> as this would exclude a substantial number of otherwise eligible donors. Other methods such as transfusion of CMV-seronegative and leukoreduced blood products must be employed to prevent the transmission of CMV to at-risk patients. In this study, the widespread use of current strategies for the prevention of transfusion-transmitted CMV (TT-CMV) infection and the evidence to support these methods in various at-risk groups were reviewed. In addition, emerging pathogen inactivation technologies that have the potential to eliminate TT-CMV were also discussed.

40|$|Inadequate <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> is a {{major public}} health problem in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study {{examines}} the influence of culture and communication on <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa, with particular focus on Ghana. The literature was systematically reviewed for aspects of culture and communication that influence <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, key informant interviews and focus group discussions with physicians, media professionals, and voluntary blood donors in Ghana were used, both to identify barriers to <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> and to obtain some recommendations for designing interventions to boost <b>blood</b> <b>donation.</b> Literature searching yielded 3020 publications, including conference abstracts. Of them, 41 publications?representing 36 studies?met inclusion criteria and were critically appraised. Aspects of culture that were identified as influencing <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa included blood donation-related misconceptions, religious beliefs, and influence of relatives. Communication channels that were identified for increasing <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> included mass media, mobile phones, and face-to-face contacts. In Ghana, beliefs and attitudes of the public that were identified as barriers to <b>blood</b> <b>donations</b> included misconceptions about <b>blood</b> <b>donation,</b> such as the erroneous belief that hospital authorities were using donated blood for rituals. Some respondents perceived that health professionals have not educated the public and journalists enough about <b>blood</b> <b>donation.</b> Another perceived barrier to <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> was negative media reporting, such as indicating the percentage of blood donors found to be HIV-positive. The lack of mutual trust between health professionals and journalists {{also served as a}} barrier to using the mass media to promote <b>blood</b> <b>donation.</b> To promote <b>blood</b> <b>donation,</b> respondents in Ghana suggested several strategies, including broadcasting radio or television dramas about <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> in English and local languages to engage both literate and illiterate populations; providing media recognition of donors who achieve blood donation-related milestones; having blood donors serve as ambassadors of blood donor drives; using social media to engage prospective younger blood donors; and using mobile telephone caller tunes or ringback tones to publicize <b>blood</b> <b>donation.</b> Thus, many culture- and communication-related factors influence <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Education had {{positive influence on}} attitudes towards <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> as well as blood donors’ satisfaction to the time and location of donation. The most common misconceptions about <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> were the risk of infection; selling donated blood to patients, and that <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> believed to cause physical weakness. AIMSThis paper is a report of a study of <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> knowledge, attitudes and barriers.

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that African migrants are often positively predisposed towards <b>blood</b> <b>donation,</b> but are under-represented in participation. A culturally-tailored intervention targeting the African migrant community in Australia {{was developed and}} implemented, to enhance knowledge about <b>blood</b> <b>donation,</b> improve attitudes towards donating, increase intentions to donate blood, and {{increase the number of}} new African donors in Australia. Four weeks after a targeted campaign, a survey evaluation process commenced, administered face-to-face by bilingual interviewers from the African community in Melbourne and Adelaide, Australia (community survey). The questionnaires covered demographics, campaign awareness, <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> knowledge and intentions, medical mistrust and perceived discrimination, and were analysed to evaluate changes in knowledge and intention. Sixty-two percent of survey participants (n = 454) reported being aware of the campaign. With increasing campaign awareness, there was a 0. 28 increase in knowledge score (p =. 005); previous <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> was also associated with an increased <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> knowledge score. <b>Blood</b> <b>donation</b> intention scores were not associated with campaign awareness (p = 0. 272), but were associated with previous <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> behaviour and a positive <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> attitude score. More positive scores on the <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> attitude measure were associated with increasing <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> intentions, self-efficacy and campaign awareness (score increases of 0. 27, 0. 30 and 0. 04, respectively, all p< 0. 05). Data were collected on the ethnicity of new blood donors in six blood collection centres before and after the intervention, and independent of the intervention evaluation survey. These data were also used to assess behavioural changes and the proportions of donors from different countries before and after the survey. There was no difference in the number of new African migrant donors, before and after the intervention.

40|$|The study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between public relations strategies regarding <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> in Thailand and audience responses to <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> {{on the part of}} blood donors and non-donors as a comparative case study in terms of a) demographics, media exposure to <b>blood</b> and <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> messages, knowledge of <b>blood</b> and <b>blood</b> <b>donation,</b> attitudes towards <b>blood</b> <b>donation,</b> and practices of <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> and nondonation and b) <b>blood</b> and <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> media messages. A variety of literature regarding public relations, communication, persuasion, and <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> was reviewed and explained under a two-way, cyclical process of public relations, starting with analysing the situation, the programming and planning of communication objectives and goals and the defined target audiences, and communicating and implementing public relations strategies. The process ended with feedback and evaluation. To accomplish the objectives of the study, a mixed strategy of semi-structured in-depth interviews and documentary research was used for examining the communication source. Four hundred questionnaires and eight focus groups, divided equally to compare blood donors and non-donors, were employed to investigate responses to <b>blood</b> <b>donation.</b> The study revealed the importance of distributing <b>blood</b> and <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> messages targeted to raise knowledge, inform attitudes and motivate behaviour change, through the controlled media supplemented by uncontrolled means and personal channels. Similarly, levels of education and knowledge, together with attitudes are all indicative factors in donating blood, while non-donors were lacking those variables. Important reasons for <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> or non-donation were also, respectively, altruism and fear. Otherwise blood donors and non-donors mainly reflected similar responses to the media messages; however, non-donors made more requests for fear reduction and statistics and attached greater importance to message repetition.

40|$|Background: There is {{a serious}} {{mismatch}} between demand and availability of blood in our country. One of the important factors motivating people for donating blood is their interaction with staff of health facilities including support staff. The knowledge and perceptions of support staff about <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> have not been studied adequately. Methodology: Data was collected from randomly selected 100 healthcare support staff using a pretested questionnaire. The questionnaire was based on prior qualitative analysis of perceptions of few of the potential participants. Results: 91 % of the respondents felt that <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> was not safe. Only 16 % had adequate knowledge about eligibility for <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> {{and all of them}} were females. 39 % respondents had donated blood themselves and 79 % had family history of <b>blood</b> <b>donation.</b> None of the socio-demographic factors except young age were found to be associated with better knowledge or positive perceptions about <b>blood</b> <b>donation.</b> Many among those who had donated blood also did not perceive <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> as safe. Apprehension about blood being not properly used and not having been approached by anyone were commonest reasons for not donating. Conclusions: The knowledge about safety, eligibility and motivation for <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> is very poor among the healthcare support staff. Efforts must be made to educate these employees and promote voluntary <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> among them. Various incentives as suggested by employees themselves and several international bodies may be considered to promote <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> among healthcare support staff...|$|R
