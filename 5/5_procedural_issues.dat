Realizing the full potential of genetic control of vectors for disease prevention will require development of a research agenda that captures the willingness of people with diverse expertise to work together toward constructive and substantive goals. Below I review the five ecological and population biology topics that are central to contemporary genetic vector-control programmes and present opportunities of collaboration between people engaged in primarily laboratory- versus field-based research activities: (1) spread and stability of introduced genes; (2) evolutionary consequences of mosquito transformation; (3) entomological risk, pathogen transmission and disease severity; (4) quantitative analyses of mosquito biology, disease and genetically modified mosquito (GMM) control; and (<b>5)</b> <b>procedural</b> <b>issues.</b> I point out opportunities for greater, mutually beneficial interaction between laboratory- and field-based scientists. I draw four general conclusions from this analysis. First, an improved understanding of ecological topics associated with GMMs will provide the conceptual and factual foundation for application of genetic-control technology. Second, four topics {{that should be considered}} research priorities are male biology, mating behaviour, colonization and mass-production effects, and population biology. Third, in addition to greater collaboration between ecologists and molecular geneticists, genetic-control programmes will require recruitment of expertise from outside the vector-borne disease arena, greater involvement by scientists from disease-endemic countries (DECs), training for young scientists, adequate funding, and a sustained effort. Fourth, collaboration will be a central component of the legacy and success of genetic control for vector-borne disease prevention...|$|E
40|$|Capsule {{endoscopy}} (CE) {{has become}} a first-line noninvasive tool for visualisation of the small bowel (SB) and is being increasingly used for investigation of the colon. The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines have specified requirements for the clinical applications of CE. However, there are no standardized recommendations yet for CE training courses in Europe. The following suggestions in this curriculum {{are based on the}} experience of European CE training courses directors. It is suggested that 12 hours be dedicated for either a small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) or a colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) course with 4 hours for an introductory CCE course delivered in conjunction with SBCE courses. SBCE courses should include state-of-the-art lectures on indications, contraindications, complications, patient management and hardware and software use. <b>Procedural</b> <b>issues</b> require approximately 2 hours. For CCE courses 2. 5 hours for theoretical lessons and 3. <b>5</b> hours for <b>procedural</b> <b>issued</b> are considered appropriate. Hands-on training on reading and interpretation of CE cases using a personal computer (PC) for 1 or 2 delegates is recommended for both SBCE and CCE courses. A total of 6 hours hands-on session- time should be allocated. Cases in a SBCE course should cover SB bleeding, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), tumors and variants of normal and cases with various types of polyps covered in CCE courses. Standardization of the description of findings and generation of high-quality reports should be essential parts of the training. Courses should be followed by an assessment of trainees' skills in order to certify readers' competency. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
