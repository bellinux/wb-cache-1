40|$|The {{mutagenic}} {{activity of}} vinyl chloride (VC) and vinylidene dichloride (VDC) at three exposure levels was assessed in fertile male CD-I mice {{with the dominant}} lethal test. Each compound was assessed in a separate study. Male mice were exposed by inhalation to VC at 3000, 10, 000, and 30, 000 ppm and to VDC at 10, 30, and 50 ppm for 6 hr/day for 5 days. By comparison with control males exposed to air, no mutagenic effects on any maturation stage of spermatogenesis in treated males were detected. There was no {{significant increase in the}} number of postimplantational early fetal deaths as shown by the number of females with one or more early deaths or the number of early deaths/pregnancy or the number of early deaths/total implants/pregnancy. There was no evidence of pre-implantational egg losses as indicated by the total implants/pregnant female. There was also no reduction in fertility. (The reduction in fertility at <b>50</b> ppm <b>VDC</b> was unproven). The lack of effect was not due to the insensitivity of the system used, since both the VC and VDC study a mutagenic effect was clearly demonstrated in male mice dosed IP with the positive control compounds cyclophosphamide (CTX) and/or ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS). During dosing these animals were housed under similar exposure conditions to those animals exposed to the test substances but with a flow of air through the exposure chambers. Thus, neither VC nor VDC is mutagenic in the mouse at the stated exposure levels as measured by the dominant lethal test...|$|R
40|$|Results of a {{study on}} Wistar rats {{regarding}} a possible carcinogenic effect of vinylidene chloride (VDC) were presented previously {{by one of the}} authors. Due to the unclear character of these results, a second inhalation study was initiated with Sprague-Dawley rats. Groups of 60 animals were exposed to 100 and 75 ppm VDC, along with one control group. A final report on the pathological results must await completion of the microscopic examination of the tissues and organs from all the animals. Nevertheless, it seems clear that there is no grossly observable interrelation between tumor production and VDC inhalation. As in the case of vinyl chloride, the problem of vinylidene chloride (VDC) is of primary importance in the field of environmental health research. Vinylidene chloride produces no clear signs of toxicity apart from a reduced growth rate observed in some animal species by Prendergast et al. (1) and the production of several types of liver damage after 3 months exposure (24 hr/day to 47 ppm). At VDC concentrations of 500 ppm, Cage (2) reported that rats exposed to 6 hr/day for 20 days had nose irritation, retarded growth rate, and histologically proven liver cell degeneration. This lesion disappeared when the concentration was lowered to 200 ppm. At this lower concentration a complete autopsy found all organs normal, while in the living animals only a slight nose irritation was observed. Carpenter et al. (3) reported that the LC <b>50</b> of <b>VDC</b> is 32, 000 ppm in Sherman rats repeatedly exposed for 4 hr/day. No effects were seen by Norris in rats exposed from 10 to 40 ppm VDC vapors for 30 days (4). The only significant finding in Sprague-Dawley rats exposed for 30 or 90 days to 25 or 75 ppm was a minimal vacuolation of cytoplasm in hepatocytes. This lesion reversed when the animals were removed from VDC exposure. Subsequent interim kills at 6 and 12 months confirmed the occurrence of minimal liver injury...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} new step-up DC-DC {{converter}} topology {{with a high}} voltage conversion ratio for renewable system applications. The desired high voltage gain and satisfactory performance {{can be achieved by}} employing only a single power switch with simple control technique. The proposed converter can be used to step up the low voltage generated from renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaic modules, to the high level of the dc bus voltage, obtaining low-to-high voltage conversion ratios of approximately 30 times without adopting extremely large duty cycle. Employing the proposed converter the low input voltage (20 - <b>50</b> <b>Vdc)</b> can be boosted up to the high output voltage level about 600 Vdc at the dc-link bus required for the three-phase inverter feeding the three-phase motor drive system. In this paper, the proposed converter configuration with only one active power switch is presented. The operating principleincluding analysis of the steady-state performance characteristics under continuous conduction mode (CCM) operating conditions is described. In addition, the control strategy is developed in order to obtain the satisfactory output voltage regulation. Finally, simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed converter with its control strategy to achievehigh step-up conversion ratios under different operating conditions...|$|E
