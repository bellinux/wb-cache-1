40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a simple yet accurate implementation of a resistor emulator type line current shaping controller for high power factor operation of a flyback rectifier. The important feature is input voltage sensing is not required. In circuit realization of the controller no multiplier is used. Current shaping is performed directly on the input filter inductor current. The modulator uses only one reset integrator for the generation of duty ratio. The analysis presented in this paper shows the effect of input filter capacitance on discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) of operation of the flyback inductor. Design equations for selection of the input filter components are derived. A low frequency small signal model of the rectifier is developed and verified by measurement up to 1 kHz.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines has empirically {{determined}} {{ignition probability}} versus current for resistive circuits in an 8. 3 % Methane-air atmosphere. Simple ignition probability, {{defined as the}} number of ignitions divided {{by the total number of}} sparks, was determined, and the corresponding currents were recorded. The experiment was designed to minimize the probability of not observing an ignition that should occur during a series of tests. For resistive circuits in 8. 3 % Methane-air mixtures, the experimental results indicate that ignition was not achieved below 2, 000 ma at 20 V DC, 350 ma at 30 v DC, 150 ma at 40 V DC, and 175 ma at <b>50</b> <b>V</b> <b>DC.</b> The simple probability of ignition corresponding to these currents is estimated to be, respectively, 1. 0 X 10 - 6, 1. 7 X 10 - 7, 3. 0 X 10 - 7, and 1. 0 X 10 - 5.

40|$|We {{present an}} electrostatically {{actuated}} rotary stage featuring liquid rings, which serve as both mechanical bearings and electric {{connections between the}} rotor and the substrate. The liquid rings are formed by confining a liquid inside hydrophilic grooves and repelling it from the superhydrophobic surfaces outside the grooves. Made of a fluid, the liquid-ring bearing avoids the dry friction of the solid bearings, significantly improving the reliability. Formed as rings, it avoids the resistance of contactangle hysteresis sliding over droplets, and hence dramatically reducing the static friction. Furthermore, surface tension facilitates the self-alignment of the rotor to the substrate and stator during the assembly and provides the stability against drift and shock during operation. Electrically, each liquid ring passes an independent electric signal, allowing a direct electrical path between the substrate and potential components on the rotor. A three-phase electrostatic rotary stage has been design, fabricated, and tested. The minimum torque to initiate the rotation is ∼ 2. 5 nṄm - hundreds of times smaller than droplet-based counterparts. The device has operated successfully by applying sequential voltages of <b>50</b> <b>V</b> <b>DC</b> between the rotor and the stators. The electric transmission has been verified by powering an LED on a rotating rotor.

40|$|A dc-dc {{converter}} {{has been developed}} for retrofitting inside the vacuum space of the HTS rotor of a synchronous generator. The heavy copper sections of the current leads used for energising the HTS field winding were replaced by cryogenic power electronics; consisting of the converter and a rotor control unit. The converter board was designed using an H-bridge configuration with two 5 A rated wires connecting the cryogenic boards to the stator control board located {{on the outside of}} the generator and drawing power from a (5 A, <b>50</b> <b>V)</b> <b>dc</b> power source. The robustness of converter board was well demonstrated when it was powered up from a cold start at 82 K. When charging the field winding with moderate currents (30 A), the heat in-leak to the ‘cold’ rotor core was only 2 W. It continued to function down to 74 K, surviving several quenches. However, the quench protection function failed when injecting 75 A into the field winding, resulting in the burn out of one of the DC-link capacitors. The magnitudes of the critical currents measured with the original current leads were compared to the quench currents, which was defined as the current which triggered quench protection protocol. The difference between the two currents was rather large, (~ 20 A). However, additional measurements using a single HTS coil in liquid nitrogen found that this reduction should not be so dramatic and in the region of 4 A. Our conclusions identified the converter’s switching voltage and its operating frequency as two parameters, which could have contributed to lowering the quench current. Magnetic fields and eddy currents are expected to be more prominent the field winding and its impact on the converter also need further investigation...|$|E
