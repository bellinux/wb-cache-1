25|$|In June 2006, a live <b>5-axis</b> STEP-NC {{machining}} demonstration was {{hosted by}} Airbus at the Université Paul Sabatier Laboratoire de Génie mécanique in Toulouse. Further machining and measurement demonstrations {{were conducted in}} Ibusuki Japan in 2007.|$|E
25|$|On October 1–2, 2008, the STEP Manufacturing team {{met at the}} Connecticut Center for Advanced Technology, in Hartford, Connecticut to {{demonstrate}} closed-loop machining, feed optimization, and measurement using STEP-NC. The highlight of the meeting was the live <b>5-axis</b> machining of a titanium impeller. Participants in the machining demonstration and other activities included Boeing, Connecticut Center for Advanced Technology, Concepts NRec, DMG, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Mitutoyo, NIST, Sandvik Coromant, Scania, Siemens, and STEP Tools.|$|E
25|$|In gas {{turbines}} and auxiliary power units. Ref. Figures 4.1–4.2 In their simple form, modern {{gas turbines}} {{operate on the}} Brayton cycle. (ref Figure 5.1) Either or both axial and centrifugal compressors are used to provide compression. The types of gas turbines that most often include centrifugal compressors include turboshaft, turboprop, auxiliary power units, and micro-turbines. The industry standards applied {{to all of the}} centrifugal compressors used in aircraft applications are set by the FAA and the military to maximize both safety and durability under severe conditions. Centrifugal impellers used in gas turbines are commonly made from titanium alloy forgings. Their flow-path blades are commonly flank milled or point milled on <b>5-axis</b> milling machines. When tolerances and clearances are the tightest, these designs are completed as hot operational geometry and deflected back into the cold geometry as required for manufacturing. This need arises from the impeller's deflections experienced from start-up to full speed/full temperature which can be 100 times larger than the expected hot running clearance of the impeller.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 the OMAC STEP-NC Working Group hosted an AP238 testing {{forum in}} Orlando to {{demonstrate}} <b>5-axis</b> parts machined using AP238 CC1 machine independent toolpaths. Four CAD/CAM systems produced AP238 machining programs for milling a <b>5-axis</b> test part (an NAS 979 circle/diamond/square with an inverted NAS 979 cone {{test in the}} center). Each run {{on a pair of}} CNCs configured for completely different machine geometries (AB tool tilt vs. BC table tilt). [...] In addition, Boeing cut parts on a variety of machines at their Tulsa facility and a machine at NIST in Gaithersburg.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} half of 2010, the testing {{activity}} focused on tool wear management and machining a part in multiple setups with multiple alternate machining plans for 3, 4 and <b>5-axis</b> machining. [...] The new test part was a gear box that must be machined on all six sides. The tool wear and consequent machine loads were predicted from the STEP-NC data and verified using a dynamometer. [...] In the second half of 2010, the testing forum applied STEP-NC to set up compensation with on-machine measurement of part and fixture datums using a FaroArm portable measurement device.|$|E

50|$|With recent {{advances}} in control and motion technology, <b>5-axis</b> water jet cutting (abrasive and pure) has become a reality. Where the normal axes on a water jet are named Y (back/forth), X (left/right) and Z (up/down), a <b>5-axis</b> system will typically add an A axis (angle from perpendicular) and C axis (rotation around the Z-axis). Depending on the cutting head, the maximum cutting angle for the A axis can be anywhere from 55, 60, {{or in some cases}} even 90 degrees from vertical. As such, <b>5-axis</b> cutting opens up a wide range of applications that can be machined on a water jet cutting machine.|$|E

50|$|STL {{and native}} dental CAD formats are {{imported}} into WorkNC Dental ready for “machining wizards” {{to guide the}} user through the manufacturing process. The system automatically selects tools, machining sequences and cutting conditions optimized for particular types of material, such as cobalt-chrome, titanium and zirconia, and for particular prostheses, such as copings and bridges. The intricate nature of some implants {{requires the use of}} <b>5-axis</b> machining methods to reach every part of the job. Traditionally requiring highly skilled programmers, WorkNC Dental overcomes this problem with its automated <b>5-axis</b> software. Intelligence within the system considers the limitations and kinematics of the machine tool itself to automatically produce reliable and collision free <b>5-axis</b> toolpaths.|$|E

50|$|A <b>5-axis</b> {{cutting head}} {{can be used}} to cut 4-axis parts, where the bottom surface {{geometries}} are shifted a certain amount to produce the appropriate angle and the Z-axis remains at one height. This can be useful for applications like weld preparation where a bevel angle needs to be cut on all sides of a part that will later be welded, or for taper compensation purposes where the kerf angle is transferred to the waste material - thus eliminating the taper commonly found on water jet-cut parts. A <b>5-axis</b> head can cut parts where the Z-axis is also moving along with all the other axes. This full <b>5-axis</b> cutting could be used for cutting contours on various surfaces of formed parts.|$|E
