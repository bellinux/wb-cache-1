40|$|Request for a {{scientific}} opinion on Potential health risks {{of exposure to}} noise from personal music players and mobile phones including a music playing function 1. Background The health effects of exposure to noise have been {{known for a long}} time, in particular noiseinduced hearing damage such as irreversible hearing loss and impairment. Hearing loss appears to accompany ageing, but noise induced hearing damage can be prevented to a large extent by reducing exposure time and levels. Measures to this effect have been introduced at the workplace. Recently the attention of the Commission services has been drawn to the need to reassure itself that sufficient preventive measures are in place to prevent hearing damage among children and adolescents from the noise of personal music players and radio communication devices including such a facility a. The regulatory framework governing the safety of this <b>equipment</b> is <b>as</b> <b>follows...</b>|$|R
40|$|Many Nuclear Safeguards {{applications}} {{can benefit}} from interactive design and simulation tools {{to be used by}} planners and inspectors at headquarters. Virtual Reality technologies provide the capability to create accurate, realistic and immersive environments, as well as create ¿objects¿ ¿ representing equipment, measurement devices and radiation sources, with specific properties and behaviours. To be adapted to Safeguards, applications need to reflect the equipment, functions (including the laws of Physics) and procedures that are ultimately used in the field. The paper presents the development of a virtual reality based prototype aimed at simulating the selection, installation, configuration and usage of Safeguards equipment. Examples include surveillance cameras and radiation detection equipment. Design and simulation are achieved by using these devices in realistic environments, including the presence of virtual radioactive sources. Application scenarios include: (a) the design of a Safeguards approach for a given installation; (b) the determination of the most appropriate location to install equipment (e. g., surveillance cameras); (c) the interactive evaluation of equipment¿s effectiveness for specific applications and scenarios; (d) training on the use of specific equipment ¿ e. g., using radiation detection equipment. The paper details an application involving the simulation of surveillance cameras for spent fuel storage areas. The system enables the interactive selection of the location (i. e., position and orientation) of cameras as well as their optical setup ¿ lens selection. In a second phase, radiation detectors are implemented. The user is presented with an interface replicating the real instrument. The user can then train his/her detection skills when using the detection <b>equipment,</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>follow</b> the best practices related to the task. JRC. DG.

40|$|In {{order to}} measure the {{pressure}} drop between near two point in a duct flowing gas with low velocity manometer for very small pressure difference was made on a trial basis. Mechanism of trial <b>equipment</b> are <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> Two inverted bells are suspended on the free end of two cunti levers respectively, strain gauges are put on the up and under side of near the each fixed end, these gauges are bridged as differential connection {{and in order to}} prevent the effect of surface tension a surface active agent was added to sealing water. Output of bridge was input to the DC amplifier and diference of pressure aplyed in both bells are indicated on DC curent meter directly. Pressure drop between two point distance of 750 mm on the 20. 3 mm ID vinyl chroride pipe flowing air was measured with the trial equipment. Liquid friction coefficient was obtained by revers calculation from measured data. Obtaind values of coefficient agreed with theoretical values with-in error of about 10 % in the region of 40 ∿ 1600 of Reynolds number which correspond to pressure difference of about 0. 0032 ∿ 0. 13 mmH_ 2 O...|$|R

By modeling of inactivation kinetics and intensity distributions design guidelines for pulse generators and treatment chambers have been derived. Different treatment chamber configurations have been evaluated with regard to field homogeneity, flow pattern as well <b>as</b> cleanability. <b>Equipment</b> with an average power level of 5, 30 and 80 kW was developed, allowing a treatment capacity of up to 10. 000 l/h.

30|$|After {{mounted on}} the clamp in the testing chamber, the {{specimens}} were placed under a constant RH value of 58  % before the actual viscoelastic measurements. The constant RH atmospheres in the <b>equipment</b> were conducted <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> The air in the chamber was firstly increased to 58  % RH (2  %/min) within 30  min and remained unchanged. After the specimens stabilized for more than 10  min, constant RH and cyclical RH tests were conducted, respectively. During the constant RH test, RH value in the testing chamber was kept 58  % within the whole time duration of 560  min. As for the cyclical RH test: RH increased from 58 to 90  % firstly, and then experienced 7 times of decrease (90 – 10  % RH) and 6 times of increase (10 – 90  % RH) alternately, finally RH increased to 58  % to end up. The whole cyclical RH progress took 560  min with a RH changing rate of 2  %/min. The MC changes were determined by weighing the specimens {{before and after the}} constant and cyclical RH tests. At least three replicates were carried out and one representative curve is shown here.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the results of a pilot trial, {{investigating}} the accessibility provided by a tablet computer (Apple iPad) to individuals with visual impairment. The study was designed around an N-of- 1 randomised controlled trial (RCT), which was replicated for 12 participants. It served as an opportunity to evaluate the use N-of- 1 trials in studies involving people who are visually impaired. Design/methodology/approach – The study centred round an N-of- 1 RCT, comparing the accessibility provided by control equipment (Windows computer) against the intervention equipment (Apple iPad). Twelve participants conducted six tests on the <b>equipment</b> <b>as</b> per randomisation, <b>followed</b> by a quantitative-based evaluation and short interviews. Findings – One-sided individual randomisation tests showed a significant result for overall satisfaction in favour of the tablet at the 0. 05 significance level for seven of the participants. Participants identified several strengths of the iPad in helping a partially sighted user in accessing the internet: inbuilt zoom and magnification options; increased control as a result of the touch screen; and accessibility tools being built into the operating system. The main limitation suggested was the way the zoom function operates by enlarging the onscreen keyboard. This caused difficulties for those with more severe visual impairments using this function in inputting text. Originality/value – There has been limited research to substantiate positive reviews of the tablet computer for low-vision users. The results of this pilot study gives evidence in support of these potential benefits, and demonstrates the importance of a more thorough investigation...|$|R
