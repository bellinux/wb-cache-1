25|$|Vitamin B12 is a co-substrate {{of various}} cell {{reactions}} involved in methylation synthesis of nucleic acid and neurotransmitters. Synthesis of the trimonoamine neurotransmitters {{can enhance the}} effects of a traditional antidepressant. The intracellular concentrations of vitamin B12 can be inferred through the total plasma concentration of homocysteine, which can be converted to methionine through an enzymatic reaction that uses <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate</b> as the methyl donor group. Consequently, the plasma concentration of homocysteine falls as the intracellular concentration of vitamin B12 rises. The active metabolite of vitamin B12 is required for the methylation of homocysteine in the production of methionine, which is involved in a number of biochemical processes including the monoamine neurotransmitters metabolism. Thus, a deficiency in vitamin B12 may impact the production and function of those neurotransmitters.|$|E

2500|$|MTR, {{also known}} as {{methionine}} synthase, is a methyltransferase enzyme, which uses the MeB12 and reaction type 2 to transfer a methyl group from <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate</b> to homocysteine, thereby generating tetrahydrofolate (THF) and methionine (for more see MTR's reaction mechanism). This functionality is lost in vitamin B12 deficiency, resulting in an increased homocysteine level and the trapping of folate as 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, from which THF (the active form of folate) cannot be recovered. THF {{plays an important role}} in DNA synthesis so reduced availability of THF results in ineffective production of cells with rapid turnover, in particular red blood cells, and also intestinal wall cells which are responsible for absorption. THF may be regenerated via MTR or may be obtained from fresh folate in the diet. Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B12 deficiency, including the megaloblastic anemia of pernicious anemia, resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known [...] "function" [...] of B12 (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B12-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production. Other cobalamin-requiring methyltransferase enzymes are also known in bacteria, such as Me-H4-MPT, coenzyme M methyltransferase.|$|E

5000|$|... 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate (N5,N10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate; 5,10-CH2-THF) is the {{substrate}} {{used by the}} enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) to generate <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate</b> (5-MTHF, or levomefolic acid).|$|E
50|$|Thus, the two {{substrates}} of this enzyme are <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate</b> and oxidized ferredoxin, whereas its 3 {{products are}} 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, reduced ferredoxin, and H+.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>5-Methyltetrahydrofolate</b> is used {{to convert}} {{homocysteine}} (a potentially toxic amino acid) to methionine by the enzyme methionine synthase. (Note that homocysteine can also be converted to methionine by the folate-independent enzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT)) ...|$|E
5000|$|About 50% of {{homocysteine}} [...] {{is converted}} back to methionine by remethylation via the methionine synthase major pathway. This requires active folate and vitamin B12, {{in order to}} donate a methyl group. Active folate is known as <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate</b> (5-MTHF).|$|E
50|$|Methionine synthase regenerates {{methionine}} (Met) from homocysteine (Hcy). The overall reaction transforms <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate</b> (N5-MeTHF) into tetrahydrofolate (THF) while transferring a methyl {{group to}} Hcy to form Met. Methionine Synthases can be cobalamin-dependent and cobalamin-independent: Plants have both, animals {{depend on the}} methylcobalamin-dependent form.|$|E
50|$|The {{reactions}} that produce, consume, and regenerate SAM-e {{are called the}} SAM-e cycle. In {{the first step of}} this cycle, the SAM-dependent methylases (EC 2.1.1) that use SAM-e as a substrate produce S-adenosyl homocysteine as a product. S-adenosyl homocysteine is a strong negative regulator of nearly all SAM-dependent methylases despite their biological diversity. This is hydrolysed to homocysteine and adenosine by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase EC 3.3.1.1 and the homocysteine recycled back to methionine through transfer of a methyl group from <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate,</b> by one of the two classes of methionine synthases (i.e. cobalamin-dependent (EC 2.1.1.13) or cobalamin-independent (EC 2.1.1.14)). This methionine can then be converted back to SAM-e, completing the cycle. In the rate-limiting step of the SAM cycle, MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) irreversibly reduces 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} some {{commentary}} on a 'reverse reaction' in which tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is produced when <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate</b> is converted back into methylenetetrahydrofolate. This however is not universally agreed upon. That reaction is thought to require 5-MTHF and SAMe. An alternative opinion is that 5-MTHF processes peroxynitrite, thereby preserving existing BH4, and that no such 'reverse reaction' occurs.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the healthy}} body stores {{three to five}} years' worth of B12 in the liver, the usually undetected {{autoimmune}} activity in one's gut over a prolonged period of time leads to B12 depletion and the resulting anemia. B12 is required by enzymes for two reactions: the conversion of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA, and the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. In the latter reaction, the methyl group of <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate</b> is transferred to homocysteine to produce tetrahydrofolate and methionine. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme methionine synthase with B12 as an essential cofactor. During B12 deficiency, this reaction cannot proceed, {{which leads to the}} accumulation of <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate.</b> This accumulation depletes the other types of folate required for purine and thymidylate synthesis, which are required for the synthesis of DNA. Inhibition of DNA replication in red blood cells results in the formation of large, fragile megaloblastic erythrocytes. The neurological aspects of the disease are thought to arise from the accumulation of methylmalonyl CoA due to the requirement of B12 as a cofactor to the enzyme methylmalonyl CoA mutase.|$|E
50|$|Folates are “conjugated” pterins {{that contain}} p-aminobenzoic acid (known as pteroic acid) and L-glutamates {{connected}} to the methyl group at position 6 of the pteridine ring system. They are critical compounds in {{a large number of}} biological group transfer reactions. These folate-dependent biosynthetic reactions include the transfer of methyl groups from <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate</b> to homocysteine to form L-methionine, and the transfer of formyl groups from 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to L-methionine to form N-formylmethionine in initiator tRNAs.|$|E
5000|$|Deficiencies of {{vitamins}} B6, B9, and B12 {{can lead to}} high homocysteine levels. Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, acts as a cofactor for the enzyme methionine synthase (which forms part of the S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) biosynthesis and regeneration cycle). Vitamin B12 deficiency prevents the <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate</b> (5-MTHF) form of folate from being converted into THF due to the [...] "methyl trap". This disrupts the folate pathway and leads {{to an increase in}} homocysteine which damages cells (for example, damage to endothelial cells can result in increased risk of thrombosis).|$|E
50|$|Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is the {{rate-limiting enzyme}} in the methyl cycle, {{and it is}} encoded by the MTHFR gene. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase catalyzes the {{conversion}} of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate,</b> a cosubstrate for homocysteine remethylation to methionine. Natural variation in this gene is common in healthy people. Although some variants {{have been reported to}} influence susceptibility to occlusive vascular disease, neural tube defects, Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, colon cancer, and acute leukemia, findings from small early studies have not been reproduced. Some mutations in this gene are associated with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency.|$|E
50|$|Because HFM {{is a rare}} disorder, {{there are}} no studies that define its optimal treatment. Correction of the {{systemic}} folate deficiency, with the normalization of folate blood levels, is easily achieved with high doses of oral folates or much smaller doses of parenteral folate. This will rapidly correct the anemia, immune deficiency and GI signs. The challenge is to achieve adequate treatment of the neurological component of HFM. It is essential that the folate dose is sufficiently high to achieve CSF folate levels {{as close as possible}} to the normal range for the age of the child. This requires close monitoring of the CSF folate level. The physiological folate is <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate</b> but the oral formulation available is insufficient for treatment of this disorder and a parenteral form is not available. The optimal folate at this time is 5-formyltetrahydrofolate which, after administration, is converted to <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate.</b> The racemic mixture of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (leucovorin) is generally available; the active S-isomer, levoleucovorin, may be obtained as well. Parenteral administration is the optimal treatment if that is possible. Folic acid should not be used for the treatment of HFM. Folic acid is not a physiological folate. It binds tightly to, and may impede, FRα-mediated endocytosis which plays an important role in the transport of folates across the choroid plexus into the CSF (see above). For a further consideration of treatment see GeneReviews.|$|E
50|$|Prenatal {{vitamins}} {{are available}} both {{over the counter}} in retail stores {{as well as by}} prescription from medical professionals. Although prescription vitamins are often covered by insurance, the relative potency of prescription-grade products are typically not significantly different from those available through retail. Differences in prescription versus retail vitamins do however exist in consistency and quality level, as well as the relative bioavailability of some specific ingredients. For example, many prescription prenatal vitamins will contain a more bioavailable form of folate; <b>5-methyltetrahydrofolate</b> (5-MTHF). Doses of folic acid over 1mg are prescription only. The amount of non-prescription prenatal vitamins needed to achieve this dose may have too much vitamin A and lead to fetal toxicity.|$|E
