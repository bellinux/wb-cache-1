All the isolates except Candida albicans — AP 3 survived at 80 °C and exhibited great potential to elaborate keratinolytic enzymes, with T. mentagrophytes demonstrating the best potential at 30 °C and 40 °C. Higher temperatures tended to reduce keratinolytic activities and there were significant (P < 0. 05) relationships between biomass weight and enzyme productivities of all the isolates except T. mentagrophytes. This indicates that in some dermatophytes keratinolytic proteinase activity is not a function of cell multiplicity. This plus the high thermostability of the enzymes are important attributes in the consideration of preventive and therapeutic methods against dermatophytes in the tropics...|$|R

40|$|Enzymatic {{saccharification}} of non-food biomass, such as lignocellulose, {{can produce}} sugars.

In this research, various types of enzymes, enzyme loadings, and pretreatments for corn stover have been studied in batch hydrolysis to determine the preferred reaction conditions for countercurrent saccharification. Based on the results, cellulase CTec 3 shows better enzymatic saccharification performance than CTec 2 for both raw and pretreated corn stover. For a given enzyme dose, lime pretreatment improves enzymatic digestibility of corn stover significantly. Shock treatment of lime-treated corn stover further increases substrate digestibility. At a CTec 3 dose of 10 mg protein/g <b>dry</b> <b>biomass,</b> the glucose yield of lime + shock treated corn stover is close to 100 %. In contrast, lime pretreated corn stover yields 85 %, and raw corn stover yields only 25 %. For lime + shock treated corn stover, adding additional HTec 3 (1 mg protein/g <b>dry</b> <b>biomass)</b> improved both glucose and xylose yields nearly 30 % compared to CTec 3 (1 mg protein/g <b>dry</b> <b>biomass).</b> The effect of production inhibition on enzyme activity was also tested. When 80 g/L glucose was initially added, glucose and xylose yields decrease 20 % and 5 %, respectively. Countercurrent saccharification of lime + shock treated corn stover with enzyme CTec 3 (1 mg protein/g <b>dry</b> <b>biomass)</b> and CTec 3 (1 mg protein/g <b>dry</b> <b>biomass)</b> + HTec 3 (1 mg protein/g <b>dry</b> <b>biomass)</b> was studied.

For CTec 3 (1 mg protein/g <b>dry</b> <b>biomass),</b> the glucose and xylose yields were 64 % and 39 %, respectively. For CTec 3 (1 mg protein/g <b>dry</b> <b>biomass)</b> + HTec 3 (1 mg protein/g <b>dry</b> <b>biomass),</b> glucose and xylose yields were 72 % and 62 %, respectively.

Experiments (E 1, E 2, and E 3) were conducted in a randomized blocks design, with three, three, and five replicates, respectively. The objectives were to evaluate biomass of the shoots of: a) gliricidia (G) and sabiá (S), {{as a response to}} planting density; b) G, S, and neem (N) in competition; c) G, and S in agroforestry. E 1 was conducted in split-plots, and planting densities (400, 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 plants ha- 1) as subplots. E 2 consisted of a factorial comprising the following plots: GGG, NGN, SGS, NNN, GNG, SNS, SSS, GSG, NSN (each letter represents a row of plants). E 3 was conducted with G and S in agroforestry experiment. The trees were harvested after 54, 42, and 27 months old, in E 1, E 2 and E 3, respectively. In E 1, G presented higher green biomass of the stems and leaf at smaller densities than S, but lower green biomass of branches at most densities. The species did not differ for mean stem <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> and leaf <b>dry</b> <b>biomass,</b> but G showed higher branch <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> at most densities. Higher planting densities increased green and <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> of stems, branches, and leaves in S, but decreased those characteristics in G, with the exception of leaf dry mass, which was not influenced by density. In E 2, the behavior of each species was identical in plots containing the same or different species. Griricidia showed the highest green biomass of stems and branches, and the highest values for geren biomass of the leaf were observed for gliricidia and neem. The highest stem, branch, and leaf <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> values were obtained for G, S, and N, respectively. In E 3, G was superior for stem and leaf green biomass, and for stem and branch <b>dry</b> <b>biomass.</b> There were no differences between species for the other biomass values...|$|R

In this study, heavy metal resistant bacteria were isolated from the effluent samples of an electroplating industry and the biosorption of copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb). These isolates were characterized to evaluate their applicability for heavy metal removal from industrial wastewaters. Initially the samples physico-chemical parameters were analyzed. The optimum conditions of pH, biomass concentration and heavy metal concentration were determined for the microbial growth on biosorbents and correlated with heavy metal removal. The observed optimum conditions were applied for the biosorption process carried out in <b>dried</b> <b>biomass</b> and immobilized bacterial isolates. The biosorption capacity of immobilized bacterial isolates like Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Micrococcus sp. were 69. 34, 90. 41 and 84. 27 % of Cu, Cd and Pb respectively. But the <b>dried</b> <b>biomass</b> of the same species adsorbed only 44. 73, 86. 66 and 79. 22 % of Cu, Cd and Pb respectively.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to test the adequacy of two documented methodologies to obtain stand level <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> and carbon estimates, considering its application at regional scale, for pure and mixed stands. The procedures refer to: 1) the estimation of <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> through the use of tree biomass models and 2) the use of biomass conversion and expansion factors (BCEF) to convert stem volume raw data into aboveground <b>dry</b> <b>biomass.</b> Using the <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> values, carbon stock is easily estimated using conversion factors, being 0. 50 a generally accepted value. Case study reports to a pilot zone with pure and mixed stands of Eucalyptus globulus Labill and Pinus pinas-ter Ait. in Portugal. Procedure 1) gives the most reliable results when the database includes detailed information at tree level, both for pure or mixed stands. When individual tree data is not accessible, option 2) is an interest-ing option to consider for pure stands. The use of BCEF-based procedure in mixed stands is not advocated at least when considering the direct use of a single conversion factor, as the value of the factor strongly depends on the forest composition...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a influência dos componentes do rendimento e caracteres da planta, na produção de grãos, em trigo sob desfolha, por meio da decomposição das correlações por meio de análise de trilha. O experimento foi conduzido em Viçosa, MG, em 2004. Os tratamentos constituíram-se de três níveis de desfolha e uma testemunha, com três variedades de trigo - Anahuac, BRS 207 e BR 24 -, com quatro repetições. A desfolha foi realizada com a retirada do limbo da folha bandeira, das segunda e terceira folhas superiores. Avaliaram-se: rendimento de grãos, peso do hectolitro, massa de mil grãos, número de espigas por parcela, número de grãos por espiga, biomassa seca do colmo, biomassa seca da palha da espiga, biomassa seca total, rendimento de grãos por espiga, biomassa seca do colmo {{individual}}, biomassa seca da palha da espiga individual e biomassa seca total por planta individual. A redução da biomassa seca do colmo levou a menores perdas de rendimento de grãos, pela remobilização de fotoassimilados com a desfolha. A massa de mil grãos e o número de grãos por espiga foram os principais componentes de rendimento. A seleção direta para esses caracteres é estratégia eficiente para aumentar o rendimento de grãos em trigo sob desfolha. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate the influence of yield components and plant characters in grain production, in wheat under defoliation, through correlations decomposition using path analysis. The experiment was accomplished in Viçosa, MG, Brazil, in 2004. The treatments consisted of three levels of defoliation and a control, with three wheat varieties - Anahuac, BRS 207 and BR 24 -, with four replicates. Defoliation {{was carried out by}} removing the blade of flag leaves from the second and third top leaves. The following parameters were evaluated: grain yield, hectolitric weight, one thousand-grain weight, number of spikes per plot, number of grain per spike, culm <b>dry</b> <b>biomass,</b> spike-straw <b>dry</b> <b>biomass,</b> total <b>dry</b> <b>biomass,</b> grain yield per spike, total <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> of individual culm, straw <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> of individual spike and total <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> per individual plant. The reduction in culm <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> led to lower losses of grain yield because of the higher remobilization of photoassimilates with defoliation. Thousand-grain weight and number of grain per spike were the main yield components. The direct selection for these characters is an efficient strategy to increase grain yield in wheat under defoliation...|$|R

During the eleven weeks of the experiment, we recorded the survival, growth and <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> of both seedlings and juveniles. Every week, we removed a group of ten seedlings and ten juveniles from submerged conditions {{and put them in}} drained conditions. We measured the leaf production rate and variation in total leaf area of both seedlings and juveniles. We measured the final above and below-ground <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> for both seedlings and juveniles. The seedlings started to die from week- 2, while juveniles started to die from week- 7. Fifty percent of seedlings died over a six weeks period, while fifty percent of juveniles died over a ten-week period. Beyond seven weeks and nine weeks for seedlings and juveniles respectively, total submersion stopped growth, and delayed leaf production and the increase of the total leaf area. Above-ground <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> significantly decreased from 30 g to 10 g for seedlings and from 30 g to 25 g for juveniles, according to flood duration. Below-ground <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> percentage increased from 60 % to 80 % between week- 4 and week- 7 for seedlings. Below-ground <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> of juveniles decreased from 80 % to 50 % between week- 4 and week- 9. Our study showed that flood-prone plant species have a different response to flood conditions according to the developmental stage. The higher sensitivity to submersion of seedlings is due to its lower survivorship, lower leaf production, lower growth and more important <b>dry</b> <b>biomass</b> decrease than juveniles. This statement {{can be seen as a}} threat for population viability in the long term since human activities, such as construction of heavy industrial infrastructures and roads, induces too long flood duration that would compromise the persistence of L. girardianum populations...|$|R
