While CD 4 + T lymphocytes in patients are readily susceptible to HIV- 1 infection, peripheral blood monocytes are relatively resistant during acute or early infection, even though monocytes also express CD 4 and viral strains with macrophage (M) -tropic phenotypes predominate. CCR 5, the main coreceptor for M-tropic viruses, clearly contributes {{to the ability of}} CD 4 + T cells to be infected. To determine whether low levels of CCR 5 expression account for the block in infection of monocytes, we examined primary monocyte lineage cells during differentiation. Culturing of blood monocytes for 5 days led to an increase in the mean number of CCR 5 -positive cells from 80 % of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Levels of CCR 5 expression per monocyte were generally lower than those on MDM, perhaps below a minimum threshold level necessary for efficient infection. Productive infection may be restricted to the small subset of monocytes that express relatively high levels of CCR <b>5.</b> <b>Steady-state</b> CCR 5 mRNA levels also increased four- to fivefold during MDM differentiation.

In particular, a detailed MCNP <b>5</b> <b>steady-state</b> model of the MURR core was developed. The model, which was based on the most recent continuous-energy neutron data from the ENDF and JEFF neutron libraries, was used to compute the local continuous-energy neutron flux distribution. By coupling the computed flux spectrum to the energy-dependent ([nu], [upsilon]) cross-sections for a range of nuclides, their intrinsic reaction rates were predicted in irradiation channel ROW 2. The model was initially benchmarked by measuring the intrinsic ([nu], [upsilon]) reaction rates for a set of mostly dilute single-element standards in ROW 2. Predictions of the intrinsic reaction rates for many nuclides, including those with high epithermal sensitivity and non- 1 /v behavior, are within [plus-minus] 5 % of the measured values. Using predicted ([nu], [upsilon]) reaction-rates, trace-elemental concentrations were determined in NIST standard reference materials, bovine liver, obsidian and coal fly ash. The agreements with the certified concentrations were generally within [plus-minus] 5 %. The new methodology has produced better results for a greater number of elements than [kappa]₀. The model was also combined with MONTEBURNS and ORIGEN to test the feasibility of Mo⁹⁹production at MURR from fissioning LEU.

40|$|Vitamin A-deficient (A-) mice make strikingly poor IgG {{responses}} {{when they}} are immunized with purified protein antigens. Previously, we showed that A- T cells overproduce interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), which then could inhibit interleukin 4 (IL- 4) -stimulated B cell IgG responses. To determine if the altered IFN-gamma regulation pattern and its immunological consequences would extend to a natural infection, we studied mice infected with the parasitic helminth Trichinella spiralis. The course of the infection was similar in A- and A-sufficient (A+) mice. These mice did not differ with respect to newborn larvae/female/hour produced in the intestine, or muscle larvae burden 5 wk postinfection. They also {{did not differ in}} the intestinal worm expulsion rate until day 15, when A- mice still harbored parasites, whereas A+ mice had cleared intestinal worms. Vitamin A deficiency reduced both the frequency of B lymphocytes secreting IgG 1 antibodies to parasite antigens, and the bone marrow eosinophilia associated with helminth infection. The cytokine secretion patterns in infected mice were consistent with these observations and with previous studies. Mesenteric lymph node cells from infected A- mice secreted significantly more IFN-gamma, and significantly less IL- 2, IL- 4, and IL- 5 than infected A+ controls. A- splenocytes secreted significantly more IFN-gamma, and equivalent amounts of IL- 2, IL- 4, and IL- 5 compared with A+ controls. Interestingly, CD 4 -CD 8 - cells secreted the majority of the IL- 4 produced in the spleen. The IL- 2, IL- 4, and IL- <b>5</b> <b>steady-state</b> transcript levels correlated with secreted protein levels, but IFN- gamma transcripts did not. Although they secreted more protein, A- cells contained fewer IFN-gamma transcripts than A+ cells. These results suggest two vitamin A-mediated regulation steps in IFN-gamma gene expression: positive regulation of IFN-gamma transcript levels, and negative regulation posttranscriptionally. The essentially unaltered outcome of T. spiralis infection in vitamin A-deficient mice probably reflects a balance between cellular and humoral responses. The IFN-gamma overproduction might {{have a positive effect on}} the gut inflammatory response, but the decrease eosinophilia, cytokine production in mesenteric lymph node, and IgG 1 -secreting cell frequency might have a negative effect on T. spiralis immunity...|$|E

Our aim was to characterize the release and uptake of 5 -HT in the mouse dextran sulfate sodium (DSS; 5 % wt/vol) model of colitis. We made electrochemical recordings and used an ELISA assay to determine mucosal 5 -HT release and uptake in untreated mice and mice with DSS-induced colitis. Peak and <b>steady-state</b> <b>5</b> -HT concentrations were measured before and during blockade of the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) with 1 microM fluoxetine. Electrochemical recordings showed that colons from DSS-treated mice had roughly twice the steady-state levels of extracellular 5 -HT and compression-evoked 5 -HT release compared with untreated mice. Fluoxetine doubled the compression-evoked and <b>steady-state</b> <b>5</b> -HT levels in control and DSS mice. These data were supported by ELISA assays, which showed enhanced 5 -HT release during colitis, by immunohistochemical analyses, which showed increases in EC cell numbers, and by real-time PCR, which identified a decrease in SERT mRNA expression in the mucosa during colitis. These data {{are the first to}} demonstrate 5 -HT release close to its release site and near its site of action during DSS-colitis. We conclude that DSS-colitis increases 5 -HT availability primarily by an increase in the numbers of EC cells and/or of content of 5 -HT in these EC cells...|$|R

40|$|Erythropoietin (Epo) {{acts as the}} key {{regulator}} of {{red blood}} cell development in mammals. During erythropoiesis, Epo initiates the JAK 2 /STAT 5 signal transduction pathway that elicits pro-survival signals in erythroid progenitor cells. Therefore, the tight regulation of JAK 2 /STAT 5 signaling is crucial for the fine-tuned balance of erythrocyte production. Recently, several factors regulating Epo-induced JAK 2 /STAT 5 signaling have been identified. However, their relative contribution in controlling the dynamic behavior of JAK 2 /STAT 5 signaling is poorly understood. To elucidate the specific roles of these negative regulators in attenuating the pathway, data-based mathematical modeling was employed. In this study, standardized protocols were established facilitating the generation of quantitative time-resolved data of Epo-induced JAK 2 /STAT 5 pathway activation in primary erythroid progenitor cells and the hematopoietic cell line BaF 3 -EpoR, which is a frequently used model system to study EpoR signaling. For the fine-tuned overexpression of negative regulators in hematopoietic cells, an inducible Tet-On retroviral vector system was developed. Systematic comparison of stoichiometries and activation dynamics of Epo-induced JAK 2 /STAT 5 signaling in CFU-E and BaF 3 -EpoR cells revealed fundamental differences between both cell types, emphasizing {{the importance of the}} use of primary cells in the investigation of EpoR signaling. Genome-wide expression profiling identified potential feedback regulators of Epo-induced JAK 2 /STAT 5 signaling in CFU-E cells. To dissect the complex roles of negative regulators that employ different mechanisms to attenuate JAK 2 /STAT 5 signaling, a data-based dynamic pathway model was established. Calibration of the mathematical model was performed using multiple experimental data sets of Epo-induced JAK 2 /STAT 5 signaling monitored under different conditions. The estimated parameters were fully identifiable and displayed small confidence intervals, which are required for accurate simulations. Comprehensive model analysis identified the rapid recruitment of the phosphatase SHP- 1 as major mechanism controlling the early-phase kinetics of pathway activation, while the two transcriptionally induced regulators SOCS 3 and CIS were elucidated as modulators of the STAT <b>5</b> <b>steady-state</b> phosphorylation level. Furthermore, global sensitivity analysis uncovered the concentrations of SHP- 1 and JAK 2 as well as the parameter SOCS 3 expression as critical to control the integral signal strength of nuclear phosphorylated STAT 5, which is proportionally linked to the survival of erythroid progenitor cells. In conclusion, by combining mathematical modeling with experimental data, the crucial regulators enabling the tight control of Epo-induced JAK 2 /STAT 5 signaling were elucidated. The detailed understanding of the molecular processes and regulatory mechanisms of Epo-induced signaling during normal erythropoiesis can be further exploited to gain insights into alterations promoting erythroleukemia and related malignant hematopoietic diseases...|$|E

Both transformation of Rat- 1 fibroblasts by v-Src or K-Ras and stable transfection for expression of dominant-positive, wild-type phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) regulatory subunit p 85 alpha constitutively led to stress fiber disruption, cortical actin recruitment, extensive ruffling, and macropinosome formation, as measured by a selective acceleration of fluid-phase endocytosis. These alterations closely correlated with activation of PI 3 K and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), as assayed by 3 -phosphoinositide synthesis in situ and in vitro and inositol 1, 4, <b>5</b> trisphosphate <b>steady-state</b> levels, respectively; they were abolished by stable transfection of v-Src-transformed cells for dominant-negative truncated p 85 alpha expression and by pharmacological inhibitors of PI 3 K and PI-PLC, indicating a requirement for both enzymes. Whereas PI 3 K activation resisted PI-PLC inhibition, PI-PLC activation was abolished by a PI 3 K inhibitor and dominant-negative transfection, thus placing PI-PLC downstream of PI 3 K. Together, {{these data suggest that}} permanent sequential activation of both PI 3 K and PI-PLC is necessary for the dramatic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in oncogene-transformed fibroblasts, resulting in constitutive ruffling and macropinocytosis...|$|R
