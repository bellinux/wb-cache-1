25|$|Ungrounded NEMA 1 plugs {{are still}} popularly used by {{manufacturers}} of small appliances and electronic devices {{because of the}} design's low cost and compact size, and they are upward compatible with modern grounded NEMA <b>5</b> <b>receptacles.</b> Standards permit ungrounded plugs where the appliance does not require grounding due to low risk of leakage current, such as on double-insulated devices.|$|R
2500|$|GFCIs are {{commonly}} available {{as an integral}} part of a receptacle or a circuit breaker installed in the distribution panelboard. GFCI receptacles invariably have rectangular faces and accept so-called Decora face plates, and can be mixed with regular outlets or switches in a multi-gang box with standard cover plates. In both Canada and the US older two-wire, ungrounded NEMA 1 receptacles may be replaced with NEMA <b>5</b> <b>receptacles</b> protected by a GFCI (integral with the receptacle or with the corresponding circuit breaker) in lieu of rewiring the entire circuit with a grounding conductor. In such cases the receptacles must be labeled [...] "no equipment ground" [...] and [...] "GFCI protected"; GFCI manufacturers typically provide tags for the appropriate installation description.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: It {{is found}} that to {{determine}} optimal dimension of gear-shaped parts through bending stress formulasand Taguchi orthogonal array table. Design/methodology/approach: Whole parts of real manhole were manufactured experimentally by castingnodular graphite cast iron {{according to the}} Korean Standard. It {{can be used as}} water supply and drainage,sewage, telecommunication cable, traffic sign, electricity supply, etc. with better performance. Findings: This manhole consists of cover, outer cylinder and inner cylinder. The gear-shaped stairs are extrudedon the outer wall of inner cylinder, and on the inner wall of outer cylinder. The outer cylinder has three columnsof 4 ~ <b>5</b> <b>receptacles,</b> and the inner cylinder has three columns of 6 ~ 7 protrusions. The inner cylinder shall beslided into the outer cylinder and then be rotated within the outer cylinder in order to lock the protrusions intothe receptacles. The stairs on outer cylinder and inner cylinder allow workers to control the height of manholebecause the height is controlled by adequate locking them on sidewall in installation or rehabilitation ofmanholes. It is designed for the perfect lock. Practical implications: Use of this manhole must be drastically economical because it requires only 1 - 2 workersand simple adjustment of the height comparing with that the existing manholes is required 4 - 5 workers andreconstruction because conventional should be entirely excavated to reinstall or repair. This entire excavation ofa manhole causes too much time-consuming work, waste of resources, and obstruction of traffic. Originality/value: This paper describes an optimal design of manhole, which deals with design elements ofmanhole which has gear-shaped stairs on the road to adjust its height...|$|R

2500|$|The {{appearance}} of this plug is sometimes confused with a NEMA 10 connector, rated for 240V, but the NEMA TT-30 is a 120V device. The hot and neutral blades are angled at 45° from vertical and 90° to each other, similar to NEMA 10 devices, but the plug is slightly {{smaller than a}} NEMA 10 and larger than ordinary 5-15P plugs. The ground pin is round, like those on straight-blade NEMA grounding devices. Referring to the picture, the orientation {{is the same as}} the NEMA <b>5</b> plug and <b>receptacle,</b> with the neutral blade on the lower right.|$|R
50|$|The {{entire plant}} height {{measures}} at 15 cm high and spreads {{out in a}} {{low to the ground}} dense leafy covering, much like a carpet. The flowers are complete and 5 parted, showing actinomorphic symmetry. From the <b>receptacle</b> <b>5</b> sharp lanceolate sepals emerge, unfused, surrounding the corolla. Each petal emerges in a spiral like fashion, initially wrapping around one another, but eventually opening up at full bloom. The petals are claw shaped, forming a narrow elongated yellow throat that opens up into a wide violet, white or pink lamina. the next whorl contains a ring of 10 stamen, followed by a whorl of 5 stigma, this is consistent with other species of the genus. Flowers are terminal and with a solitary inflorescence attached to an unbranched stem. If fertilized the flower yields a narrow fruit capsule from its superior ovary.|$|R
40|$|Flowers of {{the sacred}} lotus, Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. (Nelumbonaceae) are thermogenic and physiologically thermoregulatory. The 42 g flowers remain between 30 - 36 °C during a 2 to 4 -day period despite {{fluctuations}} in environmental temperatures between about 10 - 45 °C. As the ambient temperature drops, the flowers increase heat production in proportion. Temperature regulation apparently occurs at a cellular level, by a steep, reversible thermal inhibition of respiration at flower temperatures above 30 °C. There was a marked time lag between change in flower temperature and compensatory response, suggesting regulation through a biochemical feedback mechanism rather than structural changes in enzymes or membranes. By oxidizing carbohydrate, the flowers produce up to 1 W, with {{about half of the}} heat coming from the 8. <b>5</b> g carpellary <b>receptacle.</b> The period of temperature regulation begins before petal opening and continues through the period of stigma receptivity. Temperature regulation may reward insect pollinators with a warm, equable environment, or it possibly enhances and coordinates flower development...|$|R
40|$|The obvious {{toxicity}} of {{cadmium and lead}} is at the basis of compulsory concentration determinations for lixiviation solutions of ceramic and earthenware household receptacles such as cups, plates, bowls and others. Concentrations in the food simulant which exceed 0. 100 +/- 0. 005 mg Cd dm(- 2) and 1. 00 +/- 0. 05 mg Pb dm(- 2) for flat receptacles, 0. 500 +/- 0. 025 mg Cd l(- 1) and 5. 00 +/- 0. 25 mg Pb l(- 1) for low volume (<b>5</b> l) <b>receptacles</b> are not acceptable and measures were taken by the EU member state authorities to enforce these norm concentrations. Generally, the uncertainty on the results forwarded by the legislation amounts to 5 %. This value does not at all match the pronounced variability observed f or several `identical' trade samples, but rather represents the inherent variability of spectrometric analyses alone. Considering that the coefficients of variation can {{be as high as}} similar to 30 %, either the ranges of acceptable concentrations or the maximal allowable concentrations should be corrected. Aware of the negative health effects of heavy metal contamination and of the risk increase due to dietary intake, a downward adjustment of the acceptable concentration ranges to 0. 07 mg Cd dm(- 2) +/- 12 %, 0. 30 mg Cd l(- 1) +/- 12 % and 0. 10 mg Cd l(- 1) +/- 12 % and to 0. 8 mg Pb dm(- 2) +/- 13 %, 4. 0 mg Pb l(- 1) +/- 13 % and 1. 50 mg Pb l(- 1) +/- 13 % is suggested. status: publishe...|$|R
