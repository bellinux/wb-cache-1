40|$|The {{efficiency}} and, accordingly, {{the success}} of the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) has generally been evaluated on the basis of degradation kinetics. In practice, chloride in saline wastewater is often found to inhibit degradation processes. Therefore its highly desirable to develop more effective processes which are not affected by chloride. In this study, no significant interference of chloride with monochlorophenols (MCPs, e. g. 2 -CP, 3 -CP and 4 -CP) degradation by the UV photo-activated persulfate (UV/PS) process has been observed. This indicated the “illusion” that the UV/PS process might have been an appropriate technology working under saline conditions. To further evaluate its applicability, the generation of reaction intermediates, of adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) accumulation and of acute toxicity of MCPs in the UV/PS system were examined. In reality, several <b>aromatic</b> <b>chlorinated</b> compounds (number of chlorine atoms ≥ 2), such as dichlorophenols and 2, 3, 5, 3 ′, 5 ′-pentachloro-biphenyl, were identified and quantified.

The {{aim of this study}} was to establish whether increased concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs could be found in the blood of workers in a magnesium plant. METHODS [...] Blood plasma from 10 workers, employed at a magnesium plant for 10 to 36 years, and from a control group consisting of nine people who had no direct contact with the production were studied. Isomer specific analyses of PCDDs and PCDFs by means of high resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) techniques were performed. RESULTS [...] A significant increase was found in the concentrations of some of the congeners, mainly PCDFs, in the workers compared with the control group. Octachlorodibenzofuran (OCDF) is the congener that most strongly correlates with occupational exposure in the magnesium plant.

This paper analyses the role of exposure to solvents other than benzene in hairy cell leukaemia. METHODS: The study included 226 male cases and 425 matched controls, exposure to solvents was evaluated by expert case by case review of the detailed data on occupational exposures generated by specific interviews. Also, exposure to solvents was evaluated with an independently constructed job exposure matrix (JEM). RESULTS: No association was found between hairy cell leukaemia and previous employment in a job exposed to solvents (odds ratio (OR) 0. 9 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 6 to 1. 3).

40|$|Background: 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, (2, 4 -D) is a {{selective}} herbicide available as the acids, esters and several salts which {{vary in their}} chemical properties, environmental behaviour, {{and to a lesser}} extent toxicity. The salt and ester forms are derivatives of the parent acid. It is widely used as a weed killer. The 2, 4 -D dimethylamine is one of the salts of this group. Case Presentation: We report a case of ingestion of 2, 4 -D herbicide intentionally. The patient had presented in a local hospital but transferred to our hospital in a state of deep coma. CT scan head showed diffuse cerebral oedema. The patient recovered completely after treatment with forced alkaline diuresis. Discussion: Anticholinesterase compounds are the most commonly used insecticide and the commonest compound used as poison in India. This case report emphasizes that not all poisonings are caused by anticholinesterase compounds. The initial clinical manifestations of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) poisoning are very similar to alcohol, sedative drugs, or <b>aromatic</b> <b>chlorinated</b> hydrocarbons making it even more difficult for the treating physician to suspect poisoning due to these compounds. It is thus important to identify the correct compound for proper management. Prompt diagnosis and correct treatment can save the life of a patient. The poisoning is also sometimes confused with poisoning due to anticholinesterase compound. Conclusion: 2, 4 -D is a poison which carries a high mortality. Prolonged coma, metabolic complications, skeletal muscle injury and myotonia are some of the complications of 2, 4 -D.

Benzene is readily absorbed following inhalation (70 – 80 % in humans) or oral exposure (> 90 % in rabbits and rodents). Although benzene is readily absorbed through the skin, a significant amount of a dermal application evaporates from the skin when not occluded or immersed (absorbed dose ~ 0. 05 %). Absorbed benzene is rapidly distributed throughout the body and tends to accumulate in fatty tissues (ATSDR, 2007 a). The liver serves an important function in benzene metabolism, which results in the production of several reactive metabolites (ATSDR, 2007 a). Benzene is oxidized primarily by the cytochrome P 450 (CYP) isozyme 2 E 1 to benzene oxide, which exists in equilibrium with its tautomer oxepin (Kim et al., 2006, 2007). Spontaneous rearrangement of benzene oxide produces phenol that is either excreted or oxidized by CYPs to hydroquinone, which is in turn excreted or oxidized by myeloperoxidase in th...|$|E

The harmful effects of air pollutants on human beings and environment have been the major reason for efforts in sampling, analysis and control of their sources. The major pollutants emitted to atmosphere from stationary combustion processes are nitrogen oxides, inorganic acids, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon and soot. In the current work two methods are developed for sampling and analysis of volatile <b>chlorinated</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons and semi-volatile <b>chlorinated</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons for example 2, 3, 7, 8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) by using solid sorbent, thermal desorption and high resolution GC-MS. The capacity of several solid sorbents is compared by breakthrough value and percentage recovery ofthe analyte from the sorbent. The thermal stability of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and PVC {{in the presence of}} metals is studied because PVC is a polymer commonly found in solid waste derived from medical waste, car recycling and electrical cable. Harmful pollutant emissions from combustion and pyrolysis of PVC are measured using the novel method developed in this work. The main inorganic volatile is HCl while benzene is the major volatile organic formed under pyrolysis and combustion conditions. The thermal degradation of PVC produces a large number of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbon, aromatic hydrocarbon and short chain linear gases. A study is designed for control of harmful pollutants from combustion of PVC including HCl, <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbon, <b>chlorinated</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons and soot.

The adsorption efficiency of hydrophobic zeolites toward unary mixtures of VOCs in water has already been proved [2 - 3].

To investigate the kinetics and the thermodynamics of the adsorption process, equilibrium measurements were carried under different operative conditions and structural analysis {{was performed on the}} loaded zeolite. The results showed that the adsorption capabilities of ZSM- 5 for all the compounds were reduced {{in the presence of a}} second component in the mixture, in comparison with the single-component data, indicating a competitive adsorption. The binary system was described by a competitive dual site Langmuir adsorption isotherm, according to the results obtained by structural analysis. It has been found that each site inside the zeolite framework cannot be occupied simultaneously by more than one component, because of the short intermolecular distances among the adsorption sites.

40|$|The <b>chlorinated</b> <b>aromatic</b> acids 3 -chlorobenzoate and 4 -chlorobenzoate are chemoattractants for Pseudomonas putida PRS 2000. These {{compounds}} are {{detected by}} a chromosomally encoded chemotactic response to benzoate which is inducible by beta-ketoadipate, an intermediate of benzoate catabolism. Plasmid pAC 27, encoding enzymes for 3 -chlorobenzoate degradation, {{does not appear}} to carry genes for chemotaxis toward chlorinated compounds...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a chemical {{technology for the}} reductive catalytic multiphase hydrodechlorination (HDC) of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>aromatics</b> to greatly reduce their toxicity and aid the disposal of such species. The system requires no solvent and the catalyst displays a high recycling efficiency. In the present case, 1, 3 -dichlorobenzene (1, 3 -DCB) {{was used as a}} model compound, and was quantitatively hydrodechlorinated to benzene with hydrogen, in a tri-phasic liquid system consisting of the <b>chlorinated</b> <b>aromatic</b> itself as the top organic phase, an aqueous sodium hydroxide bottom phase (that neutralises acids formed), and an Aliquat® 336 (A 336) intermediate phase containing a Pd/C catalyst. Once the reaction was complete the top phase (now just benzene) and the bottom phase (now principally aqueous NaCl) were removed and the remaining catalytic A 336 /(Pd/C) phase recycled. This model study was conducted on a multi-gram scale with a view of demonstrating its applicability to the detoxification of PCBs. Comparison of the Mass Intensity (MI) and turnover frequency (TOF) of our model reaction with three examples of published procedures for the HDC of DCB, indicated that the MI for our system (MI = 6. 33) was lower by an order of magnitude or more than that of the others (MI = 27. 9, 64. 6, 96016), and that TOFs were comparable. A preliminary cost analysis indicates approximately 2000 €/tonne to treat tonne-scale amounts of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>aromatics,</b> making the system in principle useful for industrial implementation...|$|R
