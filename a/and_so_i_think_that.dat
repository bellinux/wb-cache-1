60|$|The whole {{trend of}} my thought {{in matters of}} conduct is against {{whatever}} accentuates one's individual separation from the collective consciousness. It follows naturally from my fundamental creed that avoidable silences and secrecy are sins, just as abstinences are in themselves sins rather than virtues. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> to leave any organization or human association except for a wider and larger association, to detach oneself {{in order to go}} alone, or to go apart narrowly with just a few, is fragmentation and sin. Even if one disagrees with the professions or formulae or usages of an association, one should be sure that the disagreement is sufficiently profound to justify one's secession, and in any case of doubt, one should remain. I count schism a graver sin than heresy.|$|E

6000|$|Oh, no, I {{shall never}} pay any duties on pirated books of mine. I am much too respectable for that--yet awhile. But here--one thing that grovels me is this: {{as far as}} I can discover--while freely {{granting}} that the U. S. copyright laws are {{far and away the}} most idiotic that exist anywhere {{on the face of the}} earth--they don't authorize the government to admit pirated books into this country, toll or no toll. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> that regulation is the invention of one of those people--as a rule, early stricken of God, intellectually--the departmental interpreters of the laws, in Washington. They can always be depended on to take any reasonably good law and interpret the common sense all out of it. They can be depended on, every time, to defeat a good law, and make it inoperative--yes, and utterly grotesque, too, mere matter for laughter and derision. Take some of the decisions of the Post-office Department, for instance--though I do not mean to suggest that that asylum is any worse than the others for the breeding and nourishing of incredible lunatics--I merely instance it because it happens to be the first to come into my mind. Take that case of a few years ago where the P. M. General suddenly issued an edict requiring you to add the name of the State after Boston, New York, Chicago, &c, in your superscriptions, on pain of having your letter stopped and forwarded to the dead-letter office; yes, and I believe he required the county, too. He made one little concession in favor of New York: you could say [...] "New York City," [...] and stop there; but if you left off the [...] "city," [...] you must add [...] "N. Y." [...] to your [...] "New York." [...] Why, it threw the business of the whole country into chaos and brought commerce almost to a stand-still. Now think of that! When that man goes to--to--well, wherever he is going to--we shan't want the microscopic details of his address. I guess we can find him.|$|E

40|$|Dr. B. Hagen, {{the well}} known passionate naturalist, lived {{several years in}} Tandjong-Morawa, later in Medan, East-Sumatra, Deli. He {{published}} in »Das Ausland, 1881 ” a paper, entitled »Vorläufige Mitteilungen über die Fauna Ost Sumatras. ” In this paper he solely treated the Mammals, especially based upon the collections made by himself and by his hunters. Afterwards he presented his whole immense collection to the Leyden Museum, several thousands specimens of Mammals, Birds, Reptiles and Insects. Up to the investigations made by Dr. Hagen about nothing was known concerning the Mammals of {{the eastern part of}} Sumatra, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a review of his collections will be very wellcome to naturalists, the more as the Fauna of Sumatra is one of the bases upon which Wallace built his wide-stretching speculations. Wallace (the Malay Archipelago, 1869) made inquiries about the Orang-Utan (not Orang-Outang as Blanford writes, see the Fauna of British India, a. s. o., Mammalia, Part I, 1888, p. 4), but none of the natives had ever heard of such an animal, nor could he find any of the Dutch officials who knew anything about it. He concluded therefore, that it does not inhabit the great forest plains in the of Sumatra, but is probably confined to a limited region in the north-west. Von Rosenberg (Der Malayische Archipel, 1878) related: »der Orang-Utan wird nur in den flachen, sumpfigen Küstenwäldern angetroffen, welche nördlich von Tapanoli das Land bis Singkel überziehen und ihrer Unzugänglichkeit wegen nur selten von einem menschlichen Fusse betreten werden. ” Some years ago there was living in the Rotterdam-Zoological Gardens an Orang-Utan from the interior of Padang, West-Sumatra. In 1875 my brother-in-law hunted in Langkat, Deli, East-Sumatra, a very stout Orang-Utan, but unhappily the chinese-workmen had cut it to pieces before he could prevent it...|$|E
