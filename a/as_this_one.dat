5|$|A commercially {{oriented}} work {{aimed at}} ethnic Chinese audiences, Si Tjonat received mixed reviews; box office proceeds are unclear. Although {{intended as a}} serial, no sequel was ever made; the production house, Batavia Motion Picture, closed soon afterwards. However, several works in the same genre <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> were released soon afterwards, including Si Pitoeng, which used the same director and star.|$|E
5|$|Other kings had {{inspired}} more respect, {{but perhaps}} only Henry VIII had endeared {{himself to the}} popular imagination as much <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>one.</b> He was the playboy monarch, naughty but nice, the hero of all who prized urbanity, tolerance, good humour, {{and the pursuit of}} pleasure above the more earnest, sober, or material virtues.|$|E
5|$|In 1828, Morten Thrane Esmark found a black mineral on Løvøya island, Telemark county, Norway. He was a Norwegian {{priest and}} amateur {{mineralogist}} {{who studied the}} minerals in Telemark, where he served as vicar. He commonly sent the most interesting specimens, such <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> to his father, Jens Esmark, a noted mineralogist and professor of mineralogy and geology at the University of Oslo. The elder Esmark determined {{that it was not}} a known mineral and sent a sample to Berzelius for examination. Berzelius determined that it contained a new element. He published his findings in 1829, having isolated an impure sample by reducing KThF5 with potassium metal. Berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery and named the source mineral thorite.|$|E

5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was forced}} to regroup at Cheonan and oppose the North Korean forces again, and it suffered heavy casualties before being forced to withdraw after the Battle of Cheonan. The 24th Infantry Division would continue to fight in delaying actions such <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> for two more weeks until it was overwhelmed at the Battle of Taejon, however {{by that time the}} Pusan Perimeter would be in place, and other US divisions would be able to hold the line for several more months during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter until the Inchon Landings, when American forces would finally defeat the North Korean Army, ending {{the first phase of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Trollope {{expected}} his {{depiction of}} a fallen woman to be controversial, and unusually for him wrote a preface defending it. But the anticipated controversy never materialised, and contemporary reviewers tended to ignore that subplot, focussing instead on the courtship in the novel. Reviews were generally less than positive; many reviewers and readers who had acquired a taste for Trollope from the 1850s60s Barchester novels were unhappy about the darker tone of later novels such <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
25|$|Systems of {{classification}} such <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> are primarily {{of value to}} malacologists (people who study mollusks) and other biologists. Biological classification schemes are not merely a convenience, they are an attempt to show the actual phylogeny (the evolutionary relatedness) within a group of organisms. Thus a taxonomy such <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> {{can be seen as}} an attempt to elucidate part of the tree of life, a phylogenetic tree.|$|E

25|$|Buffy novels, such <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> are not {{considered}} by most fans as part of canon. They are usually {{not considered}} as official Buffyverse reality, but are novels from the authors' imaginations.

25|$|In most uses of en dashes, such as {{when used}} in {{indicating}} ranges, they are closed up to the joined words. It is only when en dashes take the role of em dashes – for example, in setting off parenthetical statements such <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> – that they take spaces around them. For more on the choice of em versus en in this context, see En dash versus em dash.|$|E

25|$|Flickinger v Crown Colony of Hong Kong (1991), the Court of Appeal {{held that}} section 66 of the Judicature Act 1908, which {{denied the right}} of appeal in {{extradition}} cases such <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> was to be interpreted in light of section six of the Act.

25|$|The {{church is}} {{surrounded}} by a wall of modern origin, one of several replacements. In 1838, this wall is reported by Bishop Meade as “mouldering away” while the obviously old sections of the wall may be “very old”. The present gates may have been present in 1920 as a painting of that date shows similar gates in place. Colonial churches only sporadically had graveyards such <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> enclosed by walls as most parishioners tended to inter their dead on their own plantations or farms.|$|E
25|$|This {{mechanism}} {{is an example}} of exon definition in splicing. A spliceosome assembles on an intron, and the snRNP subunits fold the RNA so that the 5' and 3' ends of the intron are joined. However, recently studied examples such <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> show that there are also interactions between the ends of the exon. In this particular case, these exon definition interactions are necessary to allow the binding of core splicing factors prior to assembly of the spliceosomes on the two flanking introns.|$|E

25|$|In 1554, martyr, George Marsh {{was held}} at the castle before {{standing}} trial at Chester Cathedral. Some Quakers, including in 1660 George Fox, were held at the castle for being politically dangerous. County gaols, such <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> were intended to hold prisoners for short periods immediately before trial. The castle also served as a debtors' prison. In the 18thcentury it became more common for county gaols to hold longer-term prisoners; as a result they began to suffer from overcrowding.|$|E
25|$|Like em dashes, en dashes can be {{used instead}} of colons or pairs of commas that mark off a nested clause or phrase. They {{can also be used}} around parenthetical {{expressions}} such <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> in place of the em dashes preferred by some publishers, particularly where short columns are used, since em dashes can look awkward {{at the end of a}} line. (See En dash versus em dash below.) In these situations, en dashes must have a single space on each side.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to surgical crown lengthening is orthodontic forced eruption, it is non-invasive, does not remove or damage {{the bone and}} can be cost effective. The tooth is extruded a couple of millimeters with simple bracketing of adjacent teeth and using light forces this will only {{take a couple of}} months. A fiberotomy is performed after crown lengthening and is easily performed by the general dentist. In many cases such <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> shown, surgery and extraction may be avoided if patient is treated orthodontically rather than periodontally.|$|E
