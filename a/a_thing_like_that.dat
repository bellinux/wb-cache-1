I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> at the end of Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Greg Hernandez, Mills explained: [...] "I {{knew that she was}} going to be a trouble maker but actually knowing the writers and the producers, I knew that the character would be rounded and have dimension and that was really fun for me to play. It wasn’t one-note all the time, it was a lot of different colors." [...] Television personality Julie Chen said, [...] "The women of Knots, Michele Lee, Joan Van Ark, and Donna Mills have been compared to earth, wind, and fire, with Donna Mills bringing the heat as Abby, the conniving vixen that everybody loved to hate." [...] According to Mills, many people were wary of meeting her in person because they assumed she would be like Abby. She said, [...] "They were very trepedacious about what I was going to do." [...] Mike Celizic of NBC said that her character was [...] "the archetypal predatory female", while Meredith Vieira said [...] "even the bad girl could show a tender side every once in a while", in reference to her daughter's on-screen drug addiction. It was this very storyline that showed Abby at her most vulnerable and human, a story which audiences recall as perhaps one of her most desperate and motherly of moments. In addition to that, Abby also helped Val get her kidnapped babies back, even though she was blamed she said she [...] "could never do <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> to anyone". When Karen and Mack began to have some problems in their marriage and Karen distanced herself from Mack, Abby confronted Karen aggressively and told her she was wrong for doing so to him.|$|E

6000|$|... “Well,” he said shortly, “I don’t want to {{go through}} <b>an</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> again. It was ’most as hard as what {{happened}} in the plaza, {{and it seems to me}} the sooner we light out of this place the better.” ...|$|R
60|$|Bianca's {{face had}} changed, but Mr. Purcey {{was not a}} man to notice <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, what's {{the matter}} with my doin' <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that?</b> It don't hurt anybody, an' I pick up a good many points." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. BARTHWICK. [Disguising {{her grief}} at once.] I simply can't imagine what Roper means {{by making a}} joke of <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't help it, Jimmy. It hurts. Everything's so changed. I'm miserable. You wouldn't {{have said}} <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> {{in the old}} days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sakes alive!" [...] {{the woman}} muttered, {{as she looked}} down. [...] "What does he carry <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> for--in a {{peaceful}} country, too!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! My {{dear old}} man, nobody minds <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> We can't be stilted and formal. It's ever {{so much more}} {{friendly}} to relax and be chummy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why?" [...] Jim asked, {{disturbed}} in no slight {{degree by}} the look of fear on the old sailor's face. [...] "How can <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> do any harm?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{understand}}? Land of--why, you see--you see--why, great Scott, can't {{you understand}} <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that?</b> Can't {{you understand the}} difference between your--why do you look so innocent and idiotic!" ...|$|R
60|$|LOUIS [indignantly] Well, {{of all the}} mean--[words fail him]! I'd {{let myself}} be shot sooner than do <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I {{consider}} youve stolen that drawing.|$|E
6000|$|... "How brutal of the friend!" [...] {{the girl}} observed. [...] "He might have {{let him down}} gently. You wouldn't do <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> would you, Mr. Pratt?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no {{knowing how}} {{that might have}} been. I never {{calculated}} those chances. When a man wants to do <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> he generally does it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Don’t let <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> bother you. You’ll {{get used}} to such things in time. It may cripple you some, but all the same you’ll be {{learning}} to walk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to say you would let <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> {{stand in the way of}} my getting on the front page of all the papers--WITH photographs? Where's your chivalry?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't {{be quite}} too horrid, Larry," [...] {{and there was}} a quiver in her voice. [...] "It wouldn't hurt you very much to take <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> from me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Married? I {{never thought}} of that. But no, I guess he's not. He'd have {{mentioned}} it. He's not the sort to hush up <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] was the answer, [...] "only {{with a fair}} wind. You can't beat <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> to windward. There's {{not enough}} {{of her in the}} water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say! You, who {{are up to}} {{fighting}} a man with your bare hands, could you--eh?--could you manage to stick one with <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> knife of mine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Speaker (laughing). [...] "Tut, tut, {{never mind}} <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I {{am sure that}} after all that we have gone through together, the House is quite agreed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> {{parliamentary}} procedure doesn't matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He didn't {{strike me}} as a conversationalist," [...] said the lady who was cousin to a baronet; [...] "but he did pass the {{vegetables}} before he helped himself. <b>A</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> shows breeding." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{accepted}} {{this with a}} smile. I who was innocently watching them was amazed to discover how much <b>a</b> fleeting <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> could hold of seduction {{without the help of}} any other feature and with that unchanging glance.|$|R
60|$|FALDER. When I found I'd done <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> {{to do it}} {{for nothing}} seemed so dreadful. I might just as well have chucked myself into the river.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am," [...] replied Peter. He {{knew that}} {{not one of the}} meadow and forest people who were always trying to catch him would do <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "There's one {{branch of}} your {{education}} that I {{should like to}} undertake if I ever saw you at <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> again. Don't you feel ashamed of yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Farrer {{shook his}} head. [...] "It {{would take more}} than that to frighten me," [...] he said, simply. [...] "I should be ashamed of myself to be afraid of <b>a</b> poor <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> It couldn’t do me any harm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it shows}} you," [...] cried my uncle, {{suddenly}} becoming grave, [...] "what Wimblehurst is, {{to have us}} all laughing at <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that!</b> We weren't {{the only ones that}} giggled. Not by any means! And, Lord! it was funny!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't let <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> {{distress}} you, matey, for {{unless the}} Britishers whip {{us out of}} our boots here in Washington, I'm thinkin' we'll have to scratch gravel a good many times before this 'ere war is ended. Where's Darius?" ...|$|R
60|$|ERNEST. [Moving {{with his}} chair, and {{stopping}} with a smile.] If you ask me, I should say it wasn't {{playing the game}} to put Molly into <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Over! What a {{word that}} is! <b>A</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> is over, {{and then all the}} world cannot put it back again. What if he should be unhappy after all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{could do}} <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> I'd die happy!" [...] she exclaimed impetuously, as {{a feeling of}} despair came over her {{at the thought of}} her own poor attempts.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We can square them,' said McCay confidently. 'We will broach {{the matter}} to them at a series of dinners at which we will be joint hosts. They are white men who will be charmed to do <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> for <b>a</b> sport like Archie.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if we {{meant to}} tell them and forgot {{to tell them}}," [...] I added, [...] "we will {{tell them that they}} ought not to want us to tell them <b>a</b> simple <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> as if they were mere babies. We must {{remember}} all these points." ...|$|R
60|$|THE FEMALE FIGURE. He made me. I had as {{much right}} to kill him as {{he had to make}} me. And how was I to know <b>that</b> <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> would kill him? I shouldn't die if he cut off my arm or leg.|$|R
