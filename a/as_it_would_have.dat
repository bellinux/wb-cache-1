The Dukes of Gloucester and Kent had both inherited their titles from their fathers, the first dukes.|$|E
5|$|Myst IV: Revelation is {{the fourth}} {{installment}} in the Myst video game series, developed and published by Ubisoft. Revelation was the first game in the series released on a DVD-ROM format; a multiple CD-ROM version was not produced <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> taken twelve compact discs to fit the data. Like , Revelation combines pre-rendered graphics with digital video, but also features real-time 3D effects for added realism.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) are derived from a {{forecast}} by city planners in 1967 which stated {{the need for a}} rail-based urban transport system by 1992. Following a debate on whether a bus-only system would be more cost-effective, then Minister for Communications Ong Teng Cheong, {{came to the conclusion that}} an all-bus system would be inadequate, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to compete for road space in a land-scarce country.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of his success with United, Bruce was {{contacted}} by Jack Charlton, manager of the Republic of Ireland national team, who had discovered that, due to his mother's place of birth, Bruce was eligible to play for Ireland. Bruce states in his autobiography that further investigation revealed that, while his earlier appearance for England B in a friendly match was not an issue, his appearances for the England Youth team in a UEFA-sanctioned tournament prohibited him from playing for the senior team of another country. He has subsequently claimed that he chose not to play for Ireland <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> caused problems for his club at a time when UEFA restricted the number of foreign players that a club could have in their squad in its competitions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War Wodehouse and his wife {{remained}} at their Le Touquet house, where, during the Phoney War, he worked on Joy in the Morning. With the advance of the Germans, the nearby Royal Air Force base withdrew; Wodehouse was offered the sole spare seat in one of the fighter aircraft, but he turned down the opportunity <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> meant leaving behind Ethel and their dog. On 21 May 1940, with German troops advancing through northern France, the Wodehouses decided to drive to Portugal and fly from there to the US. Two miles from home their car broke down, so they returned and borrowed a car from a neighbour; with the routes blocked with refugees, they returned home again.|$|E

5|$|By 1970, {{scientists}} {{realized this}} pose was incorrect {{and could not}} have been maintained by a living animal, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> resulted in the dislocation or weakening of several joints, including the hips and the articulation between the head and the spinal column. The inaccurate AMNH mount inspired similar depictions in many films and paintings (such as Rudolph Zallinger's famous mural The Age of Reptiles in Yale University's Peabody Museum of Natural History) until the 1990s, when films such as Jurassic Park introduced a more accurate posture to the general public.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, the {{defensive}} qualities of Castle Rising {{have since been}} extensively debated. The historian Robert Liddiard argues that the large windows at Castle Rising {{would have been a}} significant weakness, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been easy to fire arrows through them from the bailey, and George Garnett has questioned the utility of {{the defensive}} arrow slits, which he suggests were not well positioned or designed. The whole site was also overlooked by higher ground, which Liddiard considers would have been a key defensive weakness.|$|E
5|$|DiCaprio {{appeared}} in the mostly improvised short film called Don's Plum, {{as a favor to}} aspiring director R. D. Robb. When Robb decided to expand the black-and-white film to feature length, however, DiCaprio and costar Tobey Maguire had its release blocked by court order, arguing that they never intended to make it a theatrical release, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> commercial value thanks to their stardom. The film eventually premiered at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival, where it was well received by critics. DiCaprio's last film of the year 1995 was The Basketball Diaries, a biographical film about Jim Carroll.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, {{the castle}} was {{transferred}} {{back to the}} Ministry of Works and repaired; the Dartmouth Point Battery, by {{now known as the}} Old Battery, was leased back to the town for use as a restaurant; and the site was reopened to the public. In the 21st century it is managed by English Heritage, with the Grand Battery displayed <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> appeared in the 19th century; it received 37,940 visitors in 2007. The 14th-century gun tower is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building, the 19th-century gun battery as a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|The England openers Cyril Washbrook and Len Hutton {{were given}} a loud {{reception}} as they walked out to bat, particularly the Yorkshire local Hutton. They {{had to face the}} Australian opening pair of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller without the aid of sightscreen. It was the first time some of the Australians had played in a first-class match without a sightscreen, and those cricketers would later have to bat without its assistance. It was believed the Yorkshire administrators were reluctant to install a sightscreen <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> taken up space and lowered the capacity of the ground, and thus the gate takings.|$|E

One barrack appears <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> when Japanese Americans first arrived at Manzanar in 1942, while another has been reconstructed to represent barracks life in 1945. Exhibits in these barracks opened on April 16, 2015. A restored World War II mess hall, moved to the site from Bishop Airport in 2002, was opened to visitors in late 2010.|$|E

5|$|The Rosetta Stone was {{originally}} displayed at a slight angle from the horizontal, and rested within a metal cradle {{that was made}} for it, which involved shaving off very small portions of its sides {{to ensure that the}} cradle fitted securely. It originally had no protective covering, and it was found necessary by 1847 to place it in a protective frame, despite the presence of attendants to ensure that it was not touched by visitors. Since 2004, the conserved stone has been on display in a specially built case in the centre of the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery. A replica of the Rosetta Stone is now available in the King's Library of the British Museum, without a case and free to touch, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> appeared to early 19th-century visitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} also been {{identified}} in living sapwood, though it is latent at this time, and {{it is probable that}} it waits until the wood begins to die (when it is drier, but contains more oxygen) before the mycelia begin to grow. When the species was inoculated into living wood, it did grow, but only around the inoculation wound; the species did not spread <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done on dead wood. Another study found that the species actively colonised partially living branches, causing white rot. However, the species had little effect on the cambium, and was mostly limited to the ends of branches.|$|E
5|$|Upon his adoption, Octavius assumed his great-uncle's name Gaius Julius Caesar. Roman {{citizens}} adopted into a {{new family}} usually retained their old nomen in cognomen form (e.g., Octavianus for one who had been an Octavius, Aemilianus for one who had been an Aemilius, etc.). However, though some of his contemporaries did, {{there is no evidence}} that Octavius ever himself officially used the name Octavianus, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made his modest origins too obvious. Historians usually refer to the new Caesar as Octavian during the time between his adoption and his assumption of the name Augustus in 27BC in order to avoid confusing the dead dictator with his heir.|$|E
50|$|In 1890, Thomas built 'Brynhyfryd Mansion' at Blackstone. It was an {{elaborate}} home, three stories high and containing 49 rooms including a basement and a tower. It {{was built on}} top of a rich coal seam, and while Thomas was alive, refused to mine the coal <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>having</b> to demolish his home. After his death his wife, daughter, and her husband continued to live there and it was eventually sold in 1934 to Rylance Collieries and Brickworks who demolished the mansion in 1937 to mine the coal deposits below.|$|R

5|$|Wrestling in Kristiansund {{was first}} {{introduced}} by Løvold wrestling at circuses and town fairs. On 8 January 1911 he held a major show against circus artist Erik Blixt, for which Løvold was promised 100 Norwegian krone (NOK) if he won. Although successful, he did not accept the prize money, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made him a professional. He started competing for Fagforeningernes TIF and later IF Ørnulf in Oslo. He represented the latter {{when he won the}} 1912 Norwegian championships, thus qualifying him for the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. There he participated in the Greco-Roman light heavyweight, but was sent home after losing both his introductory rounds, against Finland's Karl Lind and Austria's Karl Barl.|$|E
5|$|Cerny's {{personal}} interests changed throughout the project, {{leading to the}} inclusion of new ideas absent from the original design documents. The game's enemy characters were designed by Cerny and Sam Comstock, who also animated them. Enemies had to be small in size due to technical limitations. Cerny and Comstock purposely omitted faces to give them unique designs and create a minimalistic appearance similar to the courses. Atari's management, however, suggested that the marble should have a smiley face to create an identified character, similar to Pac-Man. As a compromise, the cabinet's artwork depicts traces of a smiley face on the marbles. Flanagan programmed a three-dimensional physics model to dictate the marble's motions and an interpreted script for enemy behavior. As Marble Madness neared completion, the feedback from Atari's in-house focus testing was positive. In retrospect, Cerny wished he had included more courses to give the game greater longevity, but extra courses would have required more time and increased hardware costs. Atari was experiencing severe financial troubles {{at the time and}} could not extend the game's development period <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> left their production factory idle.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{a tunnel}} was {{proposed}} {{as part of}} the Connector, traveling underneath Horace J. Bryant Drive; however, the idea was rejected by Mayor James Whelan and the City Council <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> displaced many homes in the area. The same year, Mirage Resorts president Steve Wynn proposed a new casino resort in the marina district, and stated that resort would not be built unless there was better access to the site. Additional plans were later researched, and six different plans were proposed. The plans included the tunnel underneath Horace J. Bryant Drive, a tunnel underneath the adjacent Penrose Canal, two alternative tunnel locations, the elevated highway above the wetlands, and the improvement of existing streets to direct traffic through the city. Transportation officials determined all of the plans, except for the first two tunnel proposals, to have significant drawbacks.|$|E
