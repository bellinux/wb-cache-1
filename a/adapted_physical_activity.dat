Twenty-four participantswith visual impairment who are studying in various affiliated colleges of Bharathiar University, were included in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to <b>adapted</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> (N= 12) and control (N= 12) groups. Their age ranged from 18 to 25 years. The participants had not taken part in any regular exercise program before entering to this study. The experimental group has undergone 6 weeks of <b>adapted</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities,</b> whereas control group maintained their daily routine activities and no special training was given. Training program for individuals with visual impairment was 30 minutes in length and met 3 days a week. Supervised exercise training is an important issue in increasing <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> in people with visual impairment. The training was executed by adapting progressive method as slower pace and frequent repetition to aid in the maintenance of acquired skills. The following tests were performed: cardiorespiratory endurance (600 yard run/walk endurance test) and leg explosive power (standing broad jump). In the present study for the sake of analysis of data, mean and standard deviation of the variables were calculated and statistical t-test was used to compare the mean. The level of significance was set at p< 0. 05 level of confidence. For statistical calculations SPSS Statistical Package version 16 was used. The t test revealed that the <b>adapted</b> <b>physical</b> activitieshad significantly improved both variables namely cardiorespiratory endurance and leg explosive power.

This way, it is easier for them to overcome emotional hardships and develop a positive self-image. The theoretical part of the master’s thesis highlights the importance of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> for improving the health condition and the psychophysical well-being of young patients during long-term hospitalisation. Furthermore, it presents the newest research confirming the positive effects of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> on the process of recovery.

The young patients in long-term hospitalisation and their hospital teachers {{who were involved in the}} research were asked how difficult and interesting the <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> were and how they affected the well-being of the patients. The results show that the young long-term patients and hospital teachers were happy with the selected <b>physical</b> <b>activities.</b> They agree that <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> has a positive impact on the well-being and the health condition of young long-term patients.

5000|$|Assistive {{devices such}} as wheelchairs have a {{substantial}} effect {{on the quality of}} life of the patient, and careful selection is important. [...] Teaching the patient how to transfer from different positions, such as from a wheelchair into bed, is an important part of therapy, and {{devices such as}} sliding transfer boards and grab bars can assist in these tasks. [...] Individuals who are able to transfer independently from their wheelchair to the driver's seat using a sliding transfer board may be able to return to driving in an adapted vehicle. Complete independence with driving also requires the ability to load and unload one's wheelchair from the vehicle. In addition to acquiring skills such as wheelchair transfers, individuals with a spinal cord injury can greatly benefit from exercise reconditioning. In the majority of cases, spinal cord injury leaves the lower limbs either entirely paralyzed, or with insufficient strength, endurance, or motor control to support safe and effective physical training. Therefore, most exercise training employs the use of arm crank ergometry, wheelchair ergometry, and swimming. In one study, subjects with traumatic spinal cord injury participated in a progressive exercise training program, which involved arm ergometry and resistance training. Subjects in the exercise group experienced significant increases in strength for almost all muscle groups when compared to the control group. Exercisers also reported less stress, fewer depressive symptoms, greater satisfaction with physical functioning, less pain, and better quality of life. Physical therapists are able to provide a variety of exercise interventions, including, passive range of motion exercises, upper body wheeling (arm crank ergometry), functional electrical stimulation, and electrically stimulated resistance exercises all of which can improve arterial function in those living with SCI. Physical therapists can improve {{the quality of life of}} individuals with spinal cord injury by developing exercise programs that are tailored to meet individual patient needs. <b>Adapted</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> equipment can also be used to allow for sport participation: for example, sit-skiis can be used by individuals with a spinal cord injury for cross-country or downhill skiing.|$|E

Design. This was a randomized controlled study. Setting: Community, in a local sport centre. Population: Older women aged over 60 years. Methods: Seventy-six women were randomised to an exercise group providing <b>Adapted</b> <b>Physical</b> <b>Activity</b> programme for 25 weeks or a control group (in which they did not participate in any exercise programme). The one-leg stance test, Timed Up and Go test, incidence of fall and the quality of life (SF- 36 V 2) were measured at baseline and after 25 weeks. Results: The one-leg stance test and the Timed Up and Go test in the exercise group was significantly better than in the control group after the intervention period (P= 0. 005; P= 0. 001, respectively). The Physical Functioning, Vitality and General Health subdomains of quality of life were also significantly better in the exercise group compared to the control group (P= 0. 004; P= 0. 005; P= 0. 038, respectively).

Longitudinal regression models tested the relationship between baseline BMI and outcomes. Overall, a trend for a negative association was found between baseline BMI and self-reported <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and theoretical constructs targeted by the intervention over time. For example, someone with a 25 kg/m 2 BMI would report, on average, 27. 5 more minutes/week of activity compared to someone with a 30 kg/m 2 BMI at followup. Furthermore, higher baseline BMI {{was significantly associated with}} lower self-efficacy, behavioral and cognitive processes of change, and family social support over time. These findings suggest that participants with higher BMI may need additional intervention to promote <b>physical</b> <b>activity.</b> 1...|$|R
