25|$|These three {{components}} make up nature connectedness and {{are required for}} a healthy relationship with nature.

25|$|Coleridge is {{responding}} and interacting {{with many of}} Wordsworth's poems.

Langmuir's hobbies included mountaineering, skiing, piloting his own plane, and classical music.

Goddard's family had roots in New England dating to the late 1600s. With a curiosity <b>about</b> <b>nature,</b> he studied the heavens using a telescope from his father and observed the birds flying. A country boy, he loved the outdoors and became an excellent marksman with a rifle. On Sundays the family attended an Episcopal church, and Robert sang in the choir.|$|E

When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions <b>about</b> <b>nature.</b> Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.|$|E

Charlie Brown tries to correct her, but she retaliates with a false explanation, and Charlie Brown bangs his head against a tree in frustration ("Little Known Facts"). That evening, Snoopy complains that he hasn't been fed yet, and begins to overcomplicate and dramaticize the matter until Charlie Brown shows up with his dinner. Snoopy bursts into song about his craving for supper until Charlie Brown firmly tells him to eat his meal ("Suppertime").|$|E
25|$|The 18th century saw an {{increasing}} emphasis on America itself as fit subject matter for its poets. This trend is {{most evident in}} the works of Philip Freneau (17521832), who is also notable for the unusually sympathetic attitude to Native Americans shown in his writings, sometimes reflective of a skepticism toward Anglo-American culture and civilization. However, as might be expected from what was essentially provincial writing, this late colonial poetry is generally somewhat old-fashioned in form and syntax, deploying the means and methods of Pope and Gray in the era of Blake and Burns. The work of Rebecca Hammond Lard (1772–1855), although quite old, still apply to life in today's world. She writes <b>about</b> <b>nature,</b> not only the nature of environment, but also the nature of humans.|$|E

25|$|Su Shi {{and friends}} {{continued}} to write poetry, despite (or perhaps encouraged by) their frequent banishment. Su Shi collected {{some of his}} extent works from friends, having ensured that any offending lines had been removed (Murck, 50). Some of his poetry began {{more and more to}} use such a deep and subtle allusive process that {{it would be difficult for}} those outside his group to grasp the real meaning, let alone put him back on trial. One of these techniques was to use rhymes from other poems; thus, alluding to lines from that poem, and also alluding to other poems which Su Shi and his friends circulated which also matched these rhymes. Subtle complexities of profound political dissent could then be masked under cover of seemingly innocuous lines <b>about</b> <b>nature</b> scenes in the Xiaoxiang region: indeed a set of 8 conventional scenes evolved (Murck, passim). These are known as the Eight Views of Xiaoxiang.|$|E
