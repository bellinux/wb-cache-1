5|$|From May 1684, the King's illegitimate son, James Scott, Duke of Monmouth, {{lived in}} the Netherlands, where he was fêted by William and Mary. Monmouth {{was viewed as a}} rival to the Duke of York, and as a {{potential}} Protestant heir who could supplant James in the line of succession. William, however, did not consider him a viable <b>alternative</b> <b>and</b> correctly assumed that Monmouth had insufficient support.|$|E
5|$|Goldenheart is an {{eccentric}} R album that draws on dream pop, <b>alternative,</b> <b>and</b> dance genres. Its mostly midtempo songs have strong grooves and feature synthesizers, string settings, vintage keyboards, {{and an array}} of percussive sounds. A post-breakup concept album, Richard's songwriting poses relationships and personal subjects as epic tales through magical, medieval imagery and allusions to high fantasy and science fiction tropes.|$|E

5|$|Tea & Sympathy is {{the debut}} solo album by Australian {{musician}} Bernard Fanning. It {{was released on}} 31 October 2005 by Dew Process records while PowderfingerFanning's main bandwere on hiatus. Contrary to Powderfinger's usual alternative style, the album blends <b>alternative</b> <b>and</b> country-folk music. Most of the record was written after the cancer related death of his brother in 2002. His brother's death coincided {{with the end of}} Fanning's twelve-year relationship with his partner and both events were instrumental in his move away from his typically political and socially lyrical subject matter.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the middle}} of the 1970s, comics aimed at {{children}} gradually disappeared. The new breed of underground, <b>alternative</b> <b>and</b> independent comics was aimed at a more mature audience, which ran counter to the public's perception, as well as to legal restrictions. The first wave of alternative comics in the seventies was largely made up of science fiction and fantasy comics, made by budding cartoonists like Gene Day, Dave Sim, Augustine Funnell, Jim Craig, Ken Steacy, Dean Motter, and Vincent Marchesano.|$|E
40|$|Aims. To {{investigate}} patients' {{attitudes toward}} complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine, the education nurses provided about complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine for treating depression and {{to test whether}} such education mediates the effect of complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine use <b>and</b> attitudes toward complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine. Background. Although we know that attitudes influence behaviour, very few studies simultaneously explore the relationship between attitudes, education <b>and</b> complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine use. Design. Survey. Methods. This study was conducted {{as part of a}} larger survey, using face-to-face survey interviews with 206 adult patients aged 50 years or over and hospitalised in conventional hospitals in Taiwan for treatment of depression. The attitudes toward complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine <b>and</b> patient education about complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine instruments were specially developed for the study. Results. Participants expressed slightly favourable attitudes toward complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine. Many participants (50 %) expressed that they were willing to try any potential treatment for depression. They believed that complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine helped them to feel better and to live a happier life. However, 66 絥 of participants reported that they had inadequate knowledge of complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine. Participants with a higher monthly income, longer depression duration and religious beliefs hold more positive attitudes toward complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine. Most participants were not satisfied with the education they received about complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine. Patient education about complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine was found to be a mediator for the use of complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine. Conclusion. Patient education from nurses may predict patients' attitudes toward complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine. Continuing nursing education is needed to enable nurses to respond knowledgeably to concerns patients may have about complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine <b>and</b> treatment options. Relevance to clinical practice. This study highlights the potential role of patient education about complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine as an effective way of adjusting patients' attitudes toward complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine <b>and</b> to link both patients' preferences for complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine <b>and</b> health professionals' concerns about the proper use of complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine for depression management and adverse drug interactions.

5|$|Who We Are is {{the fourth}} studio album by American {{alternative}} rock band Lifehouse. It was first released via compact disc in the United States on June18,2007 by Geffen Records. It was released via digital download the next day on June19,2007. The band entered the studio without any demos recorded and only had lyrics from Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade. The songs on the album were mostly inspired by different emotions of love, bliss, struggles, and pain. Musically, the album {{is a combination of}} rock, <b>alternative,</b> <b>and</b> adult alternative.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} other {{alternatives}} were discarded, consensus gradually grew for the Flåm <b>alternative,</b> <b>and</b> the Railway Committee for Nordre Bergenhus County recommended this proposal. New plans from NSB criticized {{the mix of}} rack and adhesion railway, and instead proposed a conventional adhesion line all the way. Engineer Ferdinand Bjerke traveled to Continental Europe to study several combined railways. He published a preliminary report in 1911, which recommended an adhesion railway, although he also felt {{the need for a}} detailed study of a rack railway. His final report was finished in 1913, and although it recommended adhesion, it pointed out that the line's capacity would be smaller than predicted and that costs would be three times as high—NOK5.5 million. The plans were approved by the Ministry of Labour and NSB's main board in 1915.|$|E
5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. <b>Alternative</b> <b>and</b> safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E

5|$|In 1980 Christopher Tolkien {{published}} {{a collection of}} more fragmentary material, under the title Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth. In subsequent years (1983–1996) he {{published a}} large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle-earth. They contain unfinished, abandoned, <b>alternative,</b> <b>and</b> outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing The Hobbit for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Ann Romney {{learned that}} she had {{multiple}} sclerosis; Mitt described watching her fail a series of neurological tests as {{the worst day of}} his life. After experiencing two years of severe difficulties with the disease, she found– while living in Park City, Utah, where the couple had built a vacation home– a combination of mainstream, <b>alternative,</b> <b>and</b> equestrian therapies that enabled her to lead a lifestyle mostly without limitations. When her husband received a job offer to take over the troubled organization responsible for the 2002 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, to be held in Salt Lake City in Utah, she urged him to accept it; eager for a new challenge, as well as another chance to prove himself in public life, he did. On February 11, 1999, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002 hired Romney as its president and CEO.|$|E
5|$|Many musicians, {{bands and}} orchestras from diverse genres have been {{influenced}} by Zappa's music. Rock artists like Alice Cooper, Larry LaLonde of Primus, Fee Waybill of the Tubes all cite Zappa's influence, as do progressive, <b>alternative</b> <b>and</b> experimental rock artists like Can, Pere Ubu, Henry Cow, Trey Anastasio of Phish, Jeff Buckley, Faust, John Frusciante, Steven Wilson, and The Aristocrats. Paul McCartney regarded Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as the Beatles' Freak Out!, Jimi Hendrix, and heavy rock and metal acts like Black Sabbath, Simon Phillips, Mike Portnoy, Warren DeMartini, Steve Vai, Strapping Young Lad, System of a Down, and Clawfinger acknowledge Zappa's inspiration. On the classical music scene, Tomas Ulrich, Meridian Arts Ensemble, Ensemble Ambrosius and the Fireworks Ensemble regularly perform Zappa's compositions and quote his influence. Contemporary jazz musicians and composers Bill Frisell and John Zorn are inspired by Zappa, as is funk legend George Clinton.|$|E

5|$|The late 1970s and 1980s saw {{a massive}} {{increase}} of AAC-related research, publications, and training {{as well the}} first national and international conferences. The International Society for <b>Alternative</b> <b>and</b> Augmentative Communication (ISAAC) was founded in 1983; its members included clinicians, teachers, rehabilitation engineers, researchers, and AAC users themselves. The organization has since {{played an important role}} in developing the field through its peer-reviewed journal, conferences, national chapters and its focus on AAC in developing countries. AAC became an area of professional specialization; a 1981 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association position paper, for example, recognized AAC as a field of practice for speech-language pathologists. At the same time, AAC users and family members played an increasing prominent role in the development of knowledge of AAC through their writing and presentations, by serving on committees and founding advocacy organizations.|$|E

5|$|There were {{attempts}} to revive garage rock and elements of punk in the 1980s and 1990s, and by 2000, scenes {{had grown up}} {{as part of the}} <b>alternative</b> <b>and</b> indie music scenes in several countries. The Detroit rock scene included the White Stripes, the Von Bondies, Electric Six, the Dirtbombs, the Go, the Muggs, the Hard Lessons, Tally Hall and the Detroit Cobras. The city was also a crucial stomping ground for Ohio's the Black Keys. New York's scene included the Strokes, Interpol, Radio 4, Liars, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV on the Radio and the Rapture. In Los Angeles & San Francisco, the scene was centered around Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, the Brian Jonestown Massacre, the Dandy Warhols and the Warlocks (most of whom would later be more associated with underground psychedelic rock than the mainstream garage rock bands of the era), while bands like Silversun Pickups delivered a more poppy take on post-punk. Billy Childish and the Buff Medways from the United Kingdom, the (International) Noise Conspiracy from Sweden, and the 5.6.7.8's from Japan enjoyed underground, regional or national success.|$|E
