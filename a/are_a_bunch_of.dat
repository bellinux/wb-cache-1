Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying stuff {{out of my head}} and getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about the right amount of blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends <b>are,</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E
