500|$|Regarding the {{resolution}} of the character at season four and dropping of Kartheiser from regular cast, Minear says that they had an idea at the conception of teenage Connor that he would only last a season, and [...] "it was time to end the character's story". But, they changed his original [...] "violent, morbid" [...] sendoff to a relatively happy one, citing their likability of actor and character as the reason. Also it was [...] "nice to give someone a happy ending for once." [...] Kartheiser was satisfied with the sendoff, particularly because the issue between Angel and Connor was confronted: [...] That to me is the soul of the character. The name of the show is Angel so it all comes back to him. For Connor, everything stems from this place with Angel and Holtz, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the opportunity for him to let that out, I think he came out of his tough shell and showed a little bit of his sensitivity. He showed that he was hurt by his father and that he was hurt by Holtz. The last scene of Angel watching memory-wiped Connor dine with his new family and slipping away quietly was Whedon's idea, derived from 1937's classic movie Stella Dallas: [...] "I've given up my child. I see my child is happy, and does not know me, and I'm happy. That is the thing that made Stella Darlas the greatest, the thing that made this episode work." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic), Barcelona on October 10, 2003. Lee described {{the place of}} the filming during an interview with MTV News: [...] "We did it in a cool, old area of town. We shot some of it at this scenic point, and there was a rooftop where you could see Barcelona below. It was really neat." [...] The version of the song used on the video is different from the one off the record, with the band entering the song {{at the end of the}} bridge and a string arrangement by David Campbell. [...] Evanescence wanted the band version to be on the album as well, but [...] "the label was stuck on the demo and wouldn't let us use the version we really wanted. We fought back and forth about it and finally we gave in, but we were all so angry about it." [...] The video was filmed two weeks before Ben Moody's departure from the band. Amy Lee admitted that the visuals in the video were [...] "striking in retrospect", but added that the similarities between what was filmed and Moody's departure were coincidental: [...] "We shot it in Barcelona about a week before Ben left the band unexpectedly. I think none of us knew, including him, that he was going anywhere. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the video back and watched it, it was right after he had left. And it's bizarre how much the video is about that. We all sat there with goose bumps, like, 'Holy crap. We've got to watch that again.'" [...] In an interview with the British magazine Rock Sound, Lee further explained the concept which was related with his departure: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Advance {{in ballast}} got {{underway}} for Port Stephens at about 7 o’clock yesterday (Monday) morning, from the Government wharf, Botany Bay {{there was a}} light breeze from the SE at the time, but the weather was overcast, and the wind gradually freshened till, about three quarters of an hour afterwards, it was blowing a strong gale. We attempted to beat out, and made one board across from {{the south side of the}} bay, near Captain Cook's monument towards La Perouse As we proceeded it was thought that she would be able to get right out, but when nearing La Perouse the wind headed us [...] veering more to the eastward, and we had to go around in an attempting, to do so the vessel missed stays. We filled on her, as there was no room to wear we made another attempt to stay her She would not stay, however, and the anchor was accordingly let go, which brought her up A kedge was then run out to try and heave her off <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to work the vessel was gradually being dragged off when the line unfortunately gave way. All this time the schooner was hanging by the anchor, with her stern just clear of the rocks, and the surf was beginning to break in heavily. Just after the kedge line parted, the pawls of the windlass gave way, and then, nothing holding her she headed right round for the rocks, upon which she was dashed very shortly afterwards We had just enough time to snatch up some of our clothes, get into the boat, which was alongside and pull away. We pulled out Into the bay, and the schooner Harold bound from Wollongong to the waterworks with a cargo of coal coming up at the time we got on board of her and were all landed safely at the Waterworks, whence we came on to Sydney ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Butler told Mojo {{magazine}} that the song [...] "Paranoid" [...] was [...] "about depression, because I didn't {{really know the}} difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards." [...] In 2015 Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: [...] "I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. [...] I used to get really depressed and {{it was the only thing}} that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself." [...] According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's [...] "Communication Breakdown", with the bassist admitting, [...] "I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it... They were our favorite band by that time." [...] "Planet Caravan" [...] was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, [...] "It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, [...] "We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend." [...] Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was [...] "nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in me head <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to [...] "Hand of Doom", that's what I wrote it about." ...|$|E

60|$|And so {{we talked}} and smoked and stuffed {{watermelons}} much as two hours, {{and then it}} was pretty late, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back the house was quiet and dark, and everybody gone to bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Owen shaking me awake; and I {{thought it}} was a hoax," [...] said Harry. [...] "But it was true enough, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> on deck, there were clouds of smoke coming up the main hatch-way." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I {{ended up}} {{recording}} {{little bits of}} the song for her as YouTube links and then we just shared them back and forth <b>and</b> then <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> together she had translated them," [...] says Cardiff.

6000|$|... "It's {{the only}} way," [...] he insisted confidently. [...] "We couldn't be married in London.

60|$|Now, {{while we}} were thus employed, our third boat, which {{was in charge of}} the second mate, had gone after the whale that had caused us so much trouble, <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> the boat righted and began to look about us, we found that she was fast to the fish about a mile to leeward.|$|R
6000|$|So they {{softened}} {{down and}} said it was all right; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the village they yawled us ashore. About two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says: ...|$|E
60|$|The guard said {{we could}} take any seats we pleased; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> in we found there was {{only two or three}} people in it, and we chose two nice armchairs, hung up our wraps, and made {{ourselves}} comfortable and cosey.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{sent that}} adrift. If we are traced up {{we want to}} shield {{ourselves}} by saying we went off hunting <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back could find nothing of him and the boat, and {{had to get a}} stranger to take us ashore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By <b>and</b> by, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> {{below the}} town, the river grew wider, {{and the banks}} were sloping, but they were paved all the way with large stones.

60|$|A {{train of}} gunpowder, an {{electric}} chain--nothing could be fired, more suddenly and swiftly, than this second illumination; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> away, <b>and</b> gone upon a distant height, and looked towards it two hours afterwards, there it still stood, shining and glittering in the calm night like a jewel!

60|$|In {{order that}} Captain Hanaford {{might be willing}} to take the chances of losing his vessel, I showed him the {{guarantee}} we had received from Commodore Barney, <b>and</b> promised that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the money from the government he should share equally with us.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, I did, though," [...] said Lapham. [...] "You wait. We settled our business, {{and then}} we went into the old thing, from the very start.

60|$|We {{was about}} a month out from Sydney when old Thomas took sick. Bill Hicks {{said that it was}} owing to a ha'penny he couldn't account for; but Walter Jones, whose family was always ill, and thought 'e knew a lot about it, said that 'e knew wot it was, but 'e couldn't {{remember}} the name of it, <b>and</b> that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to London <b>and</b> Thomas saw a doctor, we should see as 'ow 'e was right.|$|R
6000|$|... "We've got it out," [...] said Dale, {{sitting down}} before {{the desk to}} enter the {{particulars}} in his diary; [...] "it was a private house, <b>and</b> well alight <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> there, but the Paddington engine was playing on it, and <b>we</b> soon <b>got</b> it under." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One there was," [...] wrote Humfrey, [...] "that I {{could have}} thought {{was no other}} than the City that the blessed St. John saw {{descending}} from Heaven, so fair was it to look on, but they cried {{out that it was}} rather a City of Destruction, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> out of the current where it was bearing down on us, our noble captain piped all hands up to prayers, and gave thanks for our happy deliverance therefrom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought I {{should die}} of hunger. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> home {{to our own}} farmer's we ravaged the pantry for {{everything}} left from supper. It wasn't much.

6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} I {{was telling the}} boys last night.

6000|$|... "As {{luck would}} have it he never tumbled to a thing <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the pond there was old Mr. Turtle lying out in the sun as if his very last day had come. He acted so sick that even though I knew he'd never had a tooth in his head I almost began to believe he really did have the toothache.|$|E
60|$|For {{about four}} hours we {{traveled}} down hill constantly. We followed a narrow bridle-path which traversed the beds of the mountain gorges, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> could <b>we</b> <b>got</b> {{out of the way}} of the long trains of laden camels <b>and</b> asses, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> could not we suffered the misery of being mashed up against perpendicular walls of rock and having our legs bruised by the passing freight. Jack was caught two or three times, and Dan and Moult as often. One horse had a heavy fall on the slippery rocks, and the others had narrow escapes. However, this was as good a road as we had found in Palestine, and possibly even the best, and so there was not much grumbling.|$|R
60|$|Whilst I, busied with my fiction, kept to my study, Zulime was ecstatically rearranging furniture. During our absence in Colorado, {{father had}} moved to another house, relinquishing all claim on the Homestead, {{and for the first}} time in our lives my wife and I were {{authentic}} householders in full possession of every room. We had a door-bell, and our clock was our own. Our meal-times conformed to our will, and not to another's. We went to bed <b>when</b> <b>we</b> pleased, <b>and</b> rose <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> ready.|$|R
6000|$|Jake waited till he was done, {{and then}} he jumped up and said, [...] "I'll show you how Frank <b>and</b> me looked <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> swept overboard," [...] and he acted it out about the limb of the tree {{scraping}} them off the raft while they were laughing at Dave and not noticing.|$|R
