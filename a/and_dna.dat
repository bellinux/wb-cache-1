5|$|All the {{functions}} of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription <b>and</b> <b>DNA</b> replication are particularly important.|$|E
5|$|An enzyme's name {{is often}} derived from its {{substrate}} or the chemical reaction it catalyzes, {{with the word}} ending in -ase. Examples are lactase, alcohol dehydrogenase <b>and</b> <b>DNA</b> polymerase. Different enzymes that catalyze the same chemical reaction are called isozymes.|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of populations of Bacillus subtilis to both native deoxyribonucleic acid (<b>DNA)</b> <b>and</b> denatured <b>DNA</b> was investigated at maximal competence and {{at various times}} during the development of compentency.

5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers <b>and</b> <b>DNA</b> extraction from soil have been developed to detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely on the presence of fruitbodies, which may help conservation efforts as well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} the dodo and the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} {{were placed in}} a family of their own, the Raphidae (formerly Dididae), because their exact relationships with other pigeons were unresolved. Each was also placed in a monotypic family (Raphidae and Pezophapidae, respectively), as it was thought that they had evolved their similarities independently. Osteological <b>and</b> <b>DNA</b> analysis has since led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae, and the dodo and solitaire are now placed in their own subfamily, Raphinae, within the family Columbidae.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{recombination}} is {{the process}} by which a strand of DNA is broken and then joined {{to the end of a}} different DNA molecule.

40|$|Giant-cell DNA was {{isolated}} from pea (Pisum sativum) inoculated with Meloidogyne incognita {{and used in}} slot blots to test for selective sequence amplification. Four sequences representing low (ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase and actin), mid-level (histone 3), and highly repetitive (large ribosomal repeat) sequence DNA were used as probes. Known amounts of root-tip <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> giant-cell <b>DNA</b> were blotted onto hybridization membranes and probed. The signal strength on autoradiographs containing equal amounts of root-tip <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> giant-cell <b>DNA</b> were compared with a scanning densitometer. No difference in signal strength between equal amounts of root-tip <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> giant-cell <b>DNA</b> was found.

5|$|Geneticists {{often use}} viruses as vectors to {{introduce}} genes into cells {{that they are}} studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells <b>and</b> <b>DNA.</b> It shows promising use {{in the treatment of}} cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in this approach is increasing, because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria.|$|E

40|$|Cell-free fetal <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> {{cell-free}} total <b>DNA</b> in maternal circulation {{have been}} proposed as potential markers for noninvasive monitoring of the placental condition during the pregnancy. However, the correlation of and change in cell-free fetal <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> cell-free total <b>DNA</b> in spontaneous abortion (SA) with fetal chromosomal aneuploidy {{have not yet been}} reported. Therefore, we investigated cell-free fetal <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> cell-free total <b>DNA</b> levels in SA women with fetal chromosomal aneuploidy. A nested case-control study was conducted with maternal plasma collected from 268 women in their first trimester of pregnancy. Subjects included 41 SA with normal fetal karyotype, 26 SA with fetal chromosomal aneuploidy, and 201 normal controls. The unmethylated PDE 9 A gene was used to measure the maternal plasma levels of cell-free fetal DNA. The GAPDH gene was used to measure the maternal plasma levels of cell-free total DNA. The diagnostic accuracy was measured using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Levels of cell-free fetal <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> cell-free total <b>DNA</b> were significantly higher in both SA women with normal fetal karyotype and SA women with fetal chromosomal aneuploidy in comparison with the normal controls (P< 0. 001 in both). The correlation between cell-free fetal <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> cell-free total <b>DNA</b> levels was stronger in the normal controls (r =  0. 843, P< 0. 001) than in SA women with normal karyotype (r =  0. 465, P =  0. 002) and SA women with fetal chromosomal aneuploidy (r =  0. 412, P =  0. 037). The area under the ROC curve for cell-free fetal <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> cell-free total <b>DNA</b> was 0. 898 (95 % CI, 0. 852 - 0. 945) and 0. 939 (95 % CI, 0. 903 - 0. 975), respectively. Significantly high levels of cell-free fetal <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> cell-free total <b>DNA</b> were found in SA women with fetal chromosomal aneuploidy. Our findings suggest that cell-free fetal <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> cell-free total <b>DNA</b> may be useful biomarkers for the prediction of SA with fetal chromosomal aneuploidy, regardless of fetal gender...|$|R

5|$|Persistent {{rumors of}} her {{possible}} escape circulated after her death, {{fueled by the}} fact that the location of her burial was unknown during the decades of Communist rule. The mass grave near Yekaterinburg which held the remains of the Tsar, his wife, and three of their daughters was revealed in 1991, and the bodies of Alexei Nikolaevich and the remaining daughter—either Anastasia or her older sister Maria—were discovered in 2007.
