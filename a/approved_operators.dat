40|$|Presently, {{precision}} {{approaches of}} aircraft to airports with vertical and lateral guidance are only conducted as straight in approaches {{with a single}} glide path, mostly using VHF radio navigation technology. Here, the final approach track is usually several kilometers long (10 nautical miles) and cannot be changed due to the linear propagation of radio signals. Using the technology of augmented Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS) this final approach path can be made more flexible with several curved and straight segments with different vertical profiles in order to enable a safe descent with vertical guidance also in mountainous terrain, around obstacles or for noise abatement. Currently, a special type of laterally guided curved approaches is already implemented in very few places. This type of approach procedure is called Required Navigation Performance Authorization Required and is usually only available for specially <b>approved</b> <b>operators.</b> Here, the lateral guidance during the approach is usually based on a position solution provided by satellite navigation systems in conjunction with inertial navigation systems and the vertical guidance is still based on measurements of a barometric altimeter. This type of approach with vertical guidance is supposed to enhance the situational awareness for pilots compared to non-precision approach procedures (no vertical guidance) and reduce the risk for controlled flight into terrain. However, {{the accuracy of the}} barometric vertical guidance is inferior compared to precision approach procedures, temperature dependent and requires the correct pressure setting for each approach in the aircraft. Therefore, novel curved approach procedures should rely solely on satellite navigation augmented by either a ground based or satellite based system and only optionally by inertial measurement systems. When augmentation systems provide additional accuracy and integrity improvements, a vertical component of the position can be computed. Together with a predefined path, this highly accurate position solution can enable curved approaches with a vertical glide path guidance down to the required minimum obstacle clearance (200 ft above ground). Using a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) at the airport, one or more Terminal Area Paths (TAP) could be broadcast to provide precision guidance to aircraft maneuvering in the terminal area. Such a use of the system would allow the provision of multiple curved approaches to multiple runway ends with only one ground installation and as such save cost to the airport and airline operator whilst providing the added benefit of noise abatement and enhanced obstacle clearance. The transmission of multiple curved or segmented steep approaches enables approaching aircraft to select the approach path most suitable for the given situation. An experimental GBAS station was installed at the research airport in Braunschweig. Data processing complied with the currently proposed requirements to support automatic landings. Corrections for GPS measurements and integrity parameters were sent to a research aircraft which was equipped with an experimental GPS receiver providing raw measurement data. The received data and measurements were then processed on board in real-time and provide approach guidance information to the experimental pilot in form of a flight director indication. To evaluate system performance the authors create a truth reference track from a post processed carrier phase solution. Finally, the GBAS outputs and the received ILS signals are compared to the truth reference. The system performed well within all specifications and showed full availability at all times during the flight. Compared to ILS, GBAS is significantly more precise and shows almost no nois...|$|E

50|$|On 30 August 2012 Combined Parking Solutions (CPS) was {{suspended}} from accessing the DVLA database for three months.The suspension {{was put in}} place as a result of CPS breaking the DVLA's rules on signage for privately issued parking tickets. The rules state(s) that parking companies must not make reference to liability by anyone other than the driver. On 14 June this year, the DVLA sent a memo to the BPA about this issue and instructed them to put out a warning to their members, download here. However, CPS was subsequently found to be in breach of this instruction on at least three separate occasions, and this resulted in their suspension.Being suspended from accessing the DVLA's registered keeper database will have a major effect upon how CPS operates. Private parking companies use this database to find out who the registered keeper is of vehicles they wish to issue a ticket to so that they can send out demands for payment. Without this data, they have no way of trying to chase payment where the driver has not identified themselves (e.g. via an appeal). Further to this, the DVLA has confirmed that CPS {{will not be able to}} retrospectively gather this data after the suspension ends or via another parking company. Furthermore, shortly before CPS {{was suspended}}, the British Parking Association had only just recently appointed a Combined Parking Solutions representative to the Board of its <b>Approved</b> <b>Operator</b> Scheme. They continue to be represented on the AOS Board and no further issues have since been reported. Combined Parking Solutions ceased to be a member of the BPA in November 2014. As part of the BPA's new Governance, the AOS Board ceased to exist in 2014. <b>Approved</b> <b>Operator</b> Scheme members are now represented on the BPA's Council of Representatives.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{being open}} to foreigners, the {{government}} is {{acutely aware of the}} environmental impact tourists can have on Bhutan's unique and virtually unspoiled landscape and culture. Therefore, they have restricted the level of tourist activity from the start, preferring higher quality tourism. Until 1991, the Bhutan Tourism Corporation (BTC), a quasi-autonomous and self-financing body, implemented the government's tourism policy. The Bhutanese government, however, privatised the Corporation in October 1991, facilitating private sector investment and activity. As a result, today over 75 licensed tourist companies operate in the country. All tourists (group or individual) must travel on a planned, prepaid, guided package tour or custom designed travel program. Most foreigners cannot travel independently in the kingdom.

50|$|An anti-terrorism law, amended in 2005 by then-Minister of the Interior Giuseppe Pisanu {{after the}} terrorists attacks in Madrid and London, used to {{restrict}} the opening of new Wi-Fi hotspots. Interested entities were required to first apply for permission to open the hotspot at the local police headquarters. The law required potential hotspot and Internet café users to present an identity document.

In 2009, only 32% of Italian Internet users had Wi-Fi access. After some unsuccessful proposals to facilitate the opening of and access to Wi-Fi hotspots, the original 2005 law was repelled in 2011.

40|$|The {{following}} report {{details the}} analysis and procedure taken not only to determine the issues limiting J.

The report addresses one crucial operation in the screen printing process, changeovers, which contribute to roughly 24 % of the screen printing process time and {{more than any other}} operation in the screen printing process. Within the changeover operation two specific tasks appear to be plaguing long changeover times: they are test print and design approval. The report elaborates on the Fishbone Diagrams utilized to bring up the potential causes of why these two tasks contribute roughly 60 % of the changeover times. From this analysis numerous issues such as: unnecessary design approvals, designers not being available to <b>approve</b> design, miscommunication, <b>operator</b> error, and bad item placement (test print shirts) were mentioned. As a result the following cost effect solutions were implemented: implementation of new design approval policy, relocation of test print shirts, staging for next job initiative, and the use of a PDF as a reference for screen printers to check work. After implementation of the previously mentioned solutions a 25 % reduction in changeover times or 5 minute savings in machine idle time was observed which constitutes an annual cost savings of $ 31, 200...|$|R
