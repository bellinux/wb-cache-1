5|$|Fossils from {{terrestrial}} dinosaurs {{also have}} been found in the Niobrara Chalk, suggesting that animals who died on shore must have been washed out to sea (one specimen of a hadrosaur appears to have been scavenged by <b>a</b> <b>shark).</b>|$|E
5|$|Kamohoali'i is {{the best}} known and revered of the shark gods, he was the older and favored brother of Pele, and helped and journeyed with her to Hawaii. He was able to assume all human and fish forms. A summit cliff on the crater of Kilauea {{is one of his}} most sacred spots. At one point he had a heiau (temple or shrine) {{dedicated}} to him on every piece of land that jutted into the ocean on the island of Molokai. Kamohoali'i was an ancestral god, not a human who became <b>a</b> <b>shark</b> and banned the eating of humans after eating one herself. In Fijian mythology, Dakuwaqa was <b>a</b> <b>shark</b> god who was the eater of lost souls.|$|E
5|$|A beach party {{takes place}} at dusk on Amity Island, where a woman named Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean. While {{treading}} water, she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner ruling the death <b>a</b> <b>shark</b> attack leads to Police Chief Martin Brody closing the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing it will ruin the town's summer economy. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Watkins {{was killed in a}} boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly after. A bounty is then placed on the shark, resulting in an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Watkins' remains and confirms her death was from <b>a</b> <b>shark</b> attack.|$|E

5|$|According to Renaissance accounts, gigantic, {{triangular}} fossil teeth {{often found}} embedded in rocky formations were once {{believed to be}} the petrified tongues, or glossopetrae, of dragons and snakes. This interpretation was corrected in 1667 by Danish naturalist Nicolas Steno, who recognized them as shark teeth, and famously produced a depiction of a shark's head bearing such teeth. He described his findings in the book The Head of <b>a</b> <b>Shark</b> Dissected, which also contained an illustration of a megalodon tooth.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with these}} disappearances, a killer whale carcass bearing large wounds is beached. Police Chief Martin Brody {{believes}} that these events are {{the work of}} <b>a</b> <b>shark.</b> Brody explains his concerns to Mayor Larry Vaughn, who highly doubts that the town has another shark problem. Later, Brody finds debris from the destroyed speedboat in the surf just off the beach. He wades over to retrieve it and uncovers the boat driver's burnt remains.|$|E

5|$|Sharks figure {{prominently}} in Hawaiian mythology. Stories tell {{of men with}} shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form. A common theme was that a shark-man would warn beach-goers of sharks in the waters. The beach-goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark-man who warned them. Hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods. Among a fishing people, {{the most popular of}} all aumakua, or deified ancestor guardians, are shark aumakua. Kamaku describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become <b>a</b> <b>shark.</b> The body transforms gradually until the kahuna can point the awe-struck family to the markings on the shark's body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved's body had been wrapped. Such <b>a</b> <b>shark</b> aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger. Like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies. The ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery. Many Native Hawaiian families claim such an aumakua, who is known by name to the whole community.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, at the beach, Brody sees a {{dark shadow}} that approaches the swimmers. Thinking it is <b>a</b> <b>shark,</b> he frantically orders everyone {{out of the}} water, and causes a panic by firing his gun. However, the shadow is revealed to be a school of bluefish. His fears are confirmed when he acquires a close-up picture of the shark from the diver's camera. The Amity town council, including local developer Len Peterson, deny the evidence and fire Brody.|$|E
5|$|After {{the raft}} was {{attacked}} and {{destroyed by the}} Others, Sawyer (Josh Holloway) surfaces in the ocean. Michael is heard screaming for Walt repeatedly, and Sawyer screams for Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). Sawyer decides to rescue Michael first, and swims over to him, dragging him onto a piece of flotsam and performing CPR. Michael then wakes up, and blames Sawyer for making him fire the flare, drawing their attackers to them. Shortly after, the two notice <b>a</b> <b>shark</b> is encircling them; Michael believes the shark was attracted to Sawyer's bleeding wound, and the two have continuous arguments.|$|E

5|$|Another {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of this genus, also proposed by Casier in 1960, is that the direct ancestor of the Carcharocles is the shark Otodus obliquus, which lived from 60 mya to 13 mya during the Paleocene and Miocene epochs. In this model, O. obliquus evolved into O. aksuaticus, which evolved into C. auriculatus, and then into C. angustidens, and then into C. chubutensis, and then finally into C. megalodon. The evolution of this lineage is characterized by the increase of serrations, the widening of the crown, the development of a more triangular shape, and the disappearance of the lateral cusps. The genus Otodus is ultimately derived from Cretolamna, <b>a</b> <b>shark</b> from the Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|Blacktip reef sharks, {{particularly}} small individuals, {{fall prey}} to larger fishes, including groupers, grey reef sharks, tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), and {{members of their own}} species. At Palmyra Atoll, adults avoid patrolling tiger sharks by staying out of the central, deeper lagoon. Their known parasites include the tapeworms Anthobothrium lesteri, Nybelinia queenslandensis, Otobothrium alexanderi, and Platybothrium jondoeorum, a myxosporidian in the genus Unicapsula, and the monogenean Dermophthirius melanopteri. One of the few documented examples of infectious disease in <b>a</b> <b>shark</b> was a fatal case of hemorrhagic septicemia in a blacktip reef shark, caused by the bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.|$|E
5|$|Calculus' shark-shaped {{submarine}} was visually {{based on}} a real American submarine; Hergé had seen a picture of this in a German newspaper. The diving suit worn in the story was also based on clippings that Hergé had accumulated. Similarly, the dockside bar depicted by the cartoonist was {{based on a}}n illustration that he had collected. The shop where Haddock and Tintin buy the diving equipment, including the suit, was inspired from a picture of a bar which was featured in the German magazine, Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung. The tribal effigy found on a Caribbean island by Sir Francis Haddock was based on a Bamileke tribal statue from Cameroon that Hergé saw in a museum. The Sirius, which had appeared before in The Shooting Star, was named after the SS Sirius, the first ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean solely under steam power, but was visually based upon the design of a trawler, the John-O.88. Hergé had sketched this ship in Ostend docks before obtaining both detailed plans of the trawler from the builders, Jos Boel & Son, and a small-scale model of it from a collector. The undersea wreck of the Unicorn was loosely inspired by images of the wreck of a 17th-century Swedish vessel, the Vasa, which Hergé had collected. The instance in the story in which <b>a</b> <b>shark</b> swallows a large box (that the characters hope contains the treasure) is based on a real account of <b>a</b> <b>shark</b> that swallowed a camera from the American underwater photographer Otis Barton, which Hergé had encountered in a French illustrated magazine.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland {{introduces}} his Jamaican cousin Madame Claude to Peter, Joe, and Quagmire {{saying she}} is a psychic. Cleveland offers to have her read their palms and determine past lives they have had. Madame Claude then determines that Joe was once an octopus whose tentacles were bitten off by <b>a</b> <b>shark,</b> and Quagmire was Jack the Ripper. When Claude reads Peter's palm, she discovers that he was Griffin Peterson, the supposed founder of Quahog where the previously-mentioned history of Quahog was a myth. Most of the episode follows {{the story of this}} past life, the main characters therein having the appearance of regular Family Guy characters.|$|E
5|$|Feeding almost {{exclusively}} on octopuses and other cephalopods, the Australian weasel shark mostly hunts near the sea floor. It is viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished through a placental connection and born after a six-month gestation period. This species is productive for <b>a</b> <b>shark,</b> with females bearing litters of 1–19 pups usually twice per year. The Australian weasel shark is caught by trawl {{and to a lesser}} extent gillnet and longline fisheries, though not in such numbers that its population is threatened. Thus, it has been listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to bony fish, {{with the exception}} of the coelacanth, the blood and other tissue of sharks and Chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea (up to 2.5%) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater, and they are therefore confined to marine environments. A few exceptions exist, such as the bull shark, which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea. When <b>a</b> <b>shark</b> dies, the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria, causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia.|$|E

5|$|Live and Let Die, a film based loosely on {{the novel}} {{starring}} Roger Moore as Bond, was released in 1973, which played on the cycle of blaxploitation films produced at the time. The film was directed by Guy Hamilton, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, and is the eighth in the Eon Productions Bond series. Some scenes from the novel were depicted in later Bond films, including the sequence of Bond and Solitaire being dragged behind Mr Big's boat, which {{was used in the}} film For Your Eyes Only, while Felix Leiter was not fed to <b>a</b> <b>shark</b> until Licence to Kill, which also faithfully adapts Live and Let Dies shoot-out in the warehouse.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{married three}} times. He {{divorced}} {{his first wife}} Hilda in February 1952 after a nine-year union that produced no children. The cricketer then wed Caryl Bond, whom he had met during the 1949–50 tour of South Africa, and the pair had two sons. Loxton later divorced Bond and wed his third wife Joan Shiels. In 2000, {{one of his sons}} and his third wife died on the same day, due to <b>a</b> <b>shark</b> attack in Fiji and drowning in the family swimming pool, respectively. In later life he lived alone and was still mobile despite being almost blind. Loxton died on 3 December 2011.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the novel}} draws from Fleming's {{personal}} experiences: {{the opening of the}} book, with Bond's arrival at New York's Idlewild Airport was inspired by Fleming's own journeys in 1941 and 1953, and the warehouse at which Leiter is attacked by <b>a</b> <b>shark</b> was based on a similar building Fleming and his wife had visited in St. Petersburg, Florida on their recent journey. He also used his experiences on his two journeys on the Silver Meteor as background for the route taken by Bond and Solitaire.|$|E
