40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the results of a study of the effects of temperature on the growth, reproduction and longevity of the cladoceran Moina salina, a species of potential use as live food in marine aquaculture. The growth rate of M. salina increased with increasing temperature. Some parameters of development, such as length at death and the number of <b>adult</b> <b>instars,</b> were also positively related to temperature. Other parameters (duration of juvenile and <b>adult</b> <b>instars)</b> decreased with increasing temperature, while the number of juvenile instars was unaffected. An increase in temperature resulted in a reduction in age at maturity and a {{decrease in the number of}} days between broods. The number of young per female, the number of broods per female, the number of young. per day of reproductive life, and the number of young per brood, increased up to a temperature of 25 °C. At 15 and 20 °C, substantial degeneration of eggs and/or embryos occurred. Likewise, temperature affected the type of reproduction carried out by sexual females. Temperature and longevity were inversely correlated. It was concluded that temperature acts as a very important factor regulating the life cycle of M. salina. Temperature> 30 °C may correspond to sublethal levels, while a temperature of 15 °C is considered to impose stress. The range 20 - 25 °C is optimal for the development and reproduction of this species...|$|R

In order to address this issue, the present study examined the life history of a medium-size species, Macrothrix rosea (Cladocera, Macrothricidae), in laboratory conditions. Neonates produced by previously acclimatized parthenogenetic females were cultured at 25 ± 1 °C to investigate their growth rate, fecundity, and development. Our results show that individuals of M. rosea underwent three juvenile instar stages and 10 adult instars at 25 °C, with an average life span 33 ± 6. 33 days. The average total number of eggs produced per individual was 121. 04, with a maximum of 151. Individuals in the seventh instar stage (fourth <b>adult</b> <b>instar)</b> produced {{the largest number of}} offspring. The growth of body length showed a logarithmic pattern, whereas the cumulative fecundity and population growth appeared to be logistic. Furthermore, we compared the growth and mean fecundity from the birth to the first <b>adult</b> <b>instar</b> at three different temperatures (i. e., 15, 20, and 25 °C). The growth rate of body length was slower at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures, while the mean fecundity was higher and the time needed for developing to adult was longer at lower temperatures.

We refute the objection that observed life-history changes of Daphnia in reaction to fish {{are the result of}} stress due to unnatural laboratory conditions. Our results also imply that the observed reactions are facultative changes in the life-history of the daphnids and are not indirect effects produced by other predator-induced processes that influence feeding or respiration of prey.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to measure and separate the physiological costs of inducible defenses from life history trade-offs and maternal effects in the waterflea Daphnia pulex. Juveniles of D. pulex produce morphological changes (''neckteeth'') and undergo life history shifts as defenses against predatory Chaoborus (phantom midge) larvae. These traits are induced by a chemical cue (kairomone) released by the predator. I performed life history experiments with and without Chaoborus kairomones at different food levels to quantify the induced changes and their potential physiological costs. The Daphnia clone used in this study also increased its body depth in response to the predator substance. Life history shifted toward a larger body size (both length and depth) and higher fecundity, which was balanced by an increased time to reach maturity and by increased <b>adult</b> <b>instar</b> durations, Reproductive effort was higher in the typical morph in the first <b>adult</b> <b>instar,</b> indicating resource allocation shifts towards growth in the protected morph. However, {{even in the absence of}} predation the chemically induced protected morph tended to show an increased intrinsic rate of population growth (r). The longer time to reach maturity was not a direct physiological cost of neckteeth production, but a trade-off for larger body size. The life history shifts are independent of neckteeth formation. Developmental mechanisms leading to life history changes occurred after neckteeth were induced and could thus be uncoupled from neckteeth formation and its direct costs. In this study no direct costs were found. Carbon incorporation rates for the two morphs, at high and low food, were not different. As a maternal effect, the larger females of the induced morph produced larger neonates which, in turn, matured at a larger size. Morphological changes, life history shifts, and maternal effects acted in concert to form defenses against Chaoborus. This study shows that the often assumed high physiological costs resulting from the formation or maintenance of the defenses are not necessary to explain the evolution of inducible defenses. As morphological changes increase the visibility of Daphnia pulex, a fitness disadvantage can be caused by a changing predator regime (e. g., fish). The results of this study suggest that environments with changing predator selectivities favor the evolution of inducible defense...|$|E
40|$|The tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatus Neumann (Acari: Ixodidae) {{naturally}} infests many host species. However, {{the mechanisms}} that {{enable it to}} feed on such {{a wide range of}} hosts are unclear. One possibility is that a tick population maintains molecular (genotypic and/or phenotypic) diversity among individuals such that individuals vary in their competency in taking bloodmeals under different feeding conditions. As a first step in testing this hypothesis, we showed that the polymorphism of salivary gland proteins, previously demonstrated in unfed ticks, was maintained during feeding on guinea-pigs. We then compared feeding performance under standard laboratory rearing conditions: one <b>instar</b> (<b>adults</b> or nymphs) feeding on guinea-pigs, with three changed conditions: (1) two <b>instars</b> (<b>adults</b> and nymphs) feeding together on guinea-pigs; (2) one <b>instar</b> (<b>adults</b> or nymphs) feeding on hamsters; and (3) two <b>instars</b> (<b>adults</b> and nymphs) feeding together on hamsters. The mean engorged weight of adult females was significantly reduced under all changed conditions, indicating that most of the adult individuals were significantly challenged by the changed conditions. However, some individuals achieved successful engorgement, indicating competence to the changed condition, and demonstrating variation in adaptive ability among individuals. Engorged females produced egg masses positively correlated to the engorged weights. More interestingly, the correlation coefficient (R) increased when feeding condition was changed. This may lead to more efficient selection for population adaptation under the changed conditions. As the feeding success of ixodid ticks depends on the efficiency of the cocktail of immunomodulatory saliva, the relevance of the polymorphism of salivary gland proteins and host adaptation is discusse...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Grasshopper {{serves as}} {{important}} model system in neuroscience, development and evolution. Representatives of this primitive insect group are also highly relevant targets of pest control efforts. Unfortunately, {{the lack of}} genetics or gene specific molecular manipulation imposes major limitations {{to the study of}} grasshopper biology. Results We investigated whether juvenile instars of the grasshopper species Schistocerca americana are conducive to gene silencing via the systemic RNAi pathway. Injection of dsRNA corresponding to the eye colour gene vermilion into first instar nymphs triggered suppression of ommochrome formation in the eye lasting through two instars equivalent to 10 – 14 days in absolute time. QRT-PCR analysis revealed a two fold decrease of target transcript levels in affected animals. Control injections of EGFP dsRNA did not result in detectable phenotypic changes. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization detected ubiquitous expression of the grasshopper homolog of the dsRNA channel protein gene sid- 1 in embryos, nymphs and adults. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that systemic dsRNA application elicits specific and long-term gene silencing in juvenile grasshopper instars. The conservation of systemic RNAi in the grasshopper suggests that this pathway can be exploited for gene specific manipulation of juvenile and <b>adult</b> <b>instars</b> {{in a wide range of}} primitive insects. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether reproductive {{variation in the}} Daphnia galeata-cucullata-hyalina hybrid species complex can explain the occurrence of hybrids and backcrosses, a total of 43 clones from three north German lakes were tested for allocation to sexual reproduction under equal stress conditions. Six replicates per clone were followed until the seventh <b>adult</b> <b>instar.</b> I used the following cues to promote sexual reproduction: short photoperiod, water from a crowded Daphnia culture, fish-conditioned water and low food concentration. For each animal, clutch size and clutch sex were recorded. Ephippia, which were empty since the animals were cultured individually, were only produced by D. cucullata and D. cucullata x hyalina (26 % and 6 % of the broods, respectively), whereas almost all taxa produced males (the range was 2 - 15 %). Intraspecific variation for male and ephippial production was also found. The fact that the taxa tested show different responses to the stimuli offered may indicate that there is reproductive isolation between them. This is supported by field data from the Tjeukemeer (The Netherlands) which shows that D. galeata mostly produces ephippia in spring and D. cucullata in autumn.

40|$|In recent years, {{some studies}} {{addressing}} the modification of phenotypically plastic traits of Daphnia {{in the presence}} of chemical cues (kairomones) from invertebrate predators have reported a lack of trade-off among resource allocation of traditional life history traits (growth and reproduction) (Spitze, 1991; Black, 1993; Weber & Declerck, 1997). In this study, we term this finding the `Chaoborus paradox'. The Chaoborus paradox contrasts with the generally accepted theory that facultative changes in life history traits are associated with costs or a modification in resource allocation. In order to unravel the Chaoborus paradox, we have tested four groups of traits that may explain resource allocation. These were (1) the trade-off between present and future reproduction, (2) reduced growth of morphological features (body length, helmet length, spine length, carapace width) prior to maturity (pre-maturity) or (3) during the first <b>adult</b> <b>instar</b> (at maturity), and (4) an increase in feeding and assimilation rates to fuel the amount of resources available to the organism. As experimental animal we used Daphnia galeata (Cladocera) and to simulate invertebrate predation we used the Chaoborus (phantom midge larvae) kairomone. A clear trade-off existed between present and future reproduction. Survival was less {{in the presence of}} Chaoborus kairomone and therefore more resources could be channelled into growth and reproduction early in life at the cost of dying younger when compared to control animals. The other groups of traits (reduced growth of morphological features and an increase the amount of resources) offer partial solutions to the Chaoborus paradox for single clones only and not for the whole population [KEYWORDS: phantom midge; morphology; physiology...|$|E

These are the very first experimental studies undertaken on these species. The long-term growth experiments were performed under controlled laboratory conditions at all combinations of temperature (22 "C, 27 "C and 32 "C) and constant food concentration (0. 03, 0. 05, 0. 10, 0. 25, 0. 50 and 1. 00 mgC/L) of the unicellular green alga Scenedesmus acutus. Animals were examined twice daily throughout their life cycle from the neonate to third <b>adult</b> <b>instar.</b> In all three species, temperature exerted the most powerful influence on embryonic duration {{but there was also}} a smaller food effect. In D. gessneri,postembry-onic durations remained more or less the same at food levels 0. 25 mgC/L but were influenced by temperature. At food concentrations of 0. 1 mgC/L or lower, postembryonic durations became increasingly prolonged, particularly at high temperatures. This threshold concentration is affected by temperature: in D. gessneri,it was 0. 1 mgC/L at 22 oC and 27 oC but higher at 32 oC (between 0. 25 and 0. 50 mgC/L).

The contents of this thesis falls into three parts of which the first contributes the major portion: experimental, field {{and the application of}} experimental findings to field data. Long term growth experiments were carried out at three temperatures and six food concentrations. Animals were examined daily from neonate to fifth <b>adult</b> <b>instar.</b> Organic carbon content of different-sized animals which had been reared on different food concentrations were analysed. Computed length/carbon weight relationships were applied to measured lengths in order to obtain body size in terms of weight. Different growth curves were fitted to obtain the best fit at different food-temperature combinations. The growth rates for the juvenile, the primiparous female and fifth instar adult were computed for defined food-temperature combinations and compared. Significant relationships are given on embryonic and post-embryonic development with food quantity and temperature, both separately and in combination. The effect of food level and temperature on reproduction were evaluated in relation to age and stage at maturity, fecundity and {{on the size of the}} young produced. The filtering structure was examined for a possible explanation of the observed differences in life-cycle characteristics of the four species.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that Daphnia hybrids are {{intermediate}} to their parental species for several life history traits, and that they combine advantageous traits of the parental species, thereby decreasing their risk of being preyed upon by planktivorous fish. In this study D. galeata, D. cucullata and their interspecific hybrid are compared with respect to cyclomorphosis and juvenile growth as a potential mechanism to avoid invertebrate predation. Helmets and tail spines are known to reduce predation risk, whereas fast juvenile growth reduces the period that Daphnia are vulnerable to predation. In laboratory cultures, I tested the hypothesis that, with regard to cyclomorphosis, juvenile hybrids are more comparable to the juveniles of D. cucullata, and with respect to growth rate, they are more comparable to D. galeata. The hybrid did not differ significantly from D, galeata in the time needed to reach 0. 9 mm body length. In contrast, the relative spine and helmet length of juvenile hybrids were more comparable with those of D. cucullata, whereas in <b>adult</b> <b>instars</b> these characters were more similar to D. galeata. Thus during the first juvenile instars, the hybrids combine the relative long helmet and spine of D. cucullata, with the faster growth of D. galeata.

Both water bodies are inhabited by zooplanktivorous fish. In contrast to Tjeukemeer, Fish Pond is also inhabited by larvae of the phantom midge Chaoborus. The life history responses of {{the two sets of}} clones to kairomones from fish (Perca), to kairomones from Chaoborus, and to a mixture of both were compared. Clones from Tjeukemeer and Fish Pond showed strong responses to the presence of fish kairomone, with reductions in adult and neonate body length, in age at first reproduction and in the total number of neonates produced during the first three <b>adult</b> <b>instars.</b> Responses to Chaoborus kairomone were much less pronounced, although there was a tendency towards {{an increase in the number}} of neonates in the first brood.

Compared to Tjeukemeer clones, Fish Pond clones had a lower size at first reproduction, produced smaller neonates and produced a higher number of neonates in their first brood. This suggests adaptation to positive rather than to negative size selective predation. Genetic differences between populations were observed mainly for constitutive life history traits, rather than for phenotypic shifts in response to the presence of predator kairomones. ...|$|R

5000|$|They {{emerge in}} May as nymphs. These {{must go through}} five or six <b>instars</b> before {{becoming}} <b>adults.</b> The final <b>instar</b> {{may be the most}} important in determining whether the insect develops as a brachypterous form or a macropterous form. [...] It has been suggested that production of macropterous forms may be due to juvenile hormone (JH) degradation in the final instar, which leads to a shorter period of JH presence within the nymph. This allows more flight muscle and wing production during metamorphosis.|$|R

40|$|Cut {{flower of}} {{chrysanthemum}} has high aesthetic and economic values. Export volume of chrysanthemums from Indonesia {{are lower than}} other countries, due {{to the impact of}} insect pest. Insect pests, Aphis gossypii Glover and Macrosiphoniella sanborni Gillette are currently associated with cut flowers  especially chrysanthemum. One control measures usually taken in quarantine is fumigation. Alternative fumigant, liquified phosphine formulations may potentially be applied for quarantine treatment. The objectives of this study were to determine the concentration and exposure time of liquified phosphine against these species and to evaluate the effect of fumigant on the physical quality of cut flowers. The experiment was conducted in four steps: (1) identification and mass rearing of A. gossypii and M. sanborni; (2) preliminary tests on <b>adult</b> and third <b>instar</b> nymphs; (3) determination of liquified phosphine with various concentration and exposure time against <b>adult</b> and third <b>instar</b> nymphs of A. gosspypii and M. sanborni and; (4) validation test of effective concentration of fumigant and exposure time and the effect on quality of cut flowers. The results of study showed concentration of fumigant causing 100 % mortality A. gossypii and M. sanborni   ere 500 ppm and 700 ppm, respectively with exposure time 12 hours. Concentrations of 700 ppm and exposure time up to 18 hours did not cause negative impact to the quality of chrysanthemum cut flowers. </p...|$|R
