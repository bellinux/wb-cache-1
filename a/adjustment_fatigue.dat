40|$|International audienceIn habitually shod {{recreational}} runners, {{we studied}} the combined influence of footwear and stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) fatigue on treadmill running pattern, paying {{special attention to}} neuro-mechanical adjustments in the acute and 2 -day delayed recovery periods. The SSC exercise consisted {{of a series of}} 25 sub-maximal rebounds on a sledge apparatus repeated until exhaustion. The acute and delayed functional fatigue effects were quantified in a maximal drop jump test. The neuro-mechanical <b>adjustments</b> to <b>fatigue</b> were examined during two submaximal treadmill run tests of 3 min performed either barefoot or with shoes on. Surface electromyographic (EMG) activities, tibial accelerations and kinematics of the right lower limb were recorded during the first and last 15 s of each run. The main result was that neuro-mechanical differences between the shod and barefoot running patterns, classically reported in the absence of fatigue, persisted in the fatigued state. However, in the delayed recovery phase, rearfoot eversion was found to significantly increase in the shod condition. This specific footwear effect is considered as a potential risk factor of overuse injuries in longer runs. Therefore, specific care should be addressed in the delayed recovery phase of SSC fatigue and the use of motion control shoes could be of interest...|$|R
40|$|Objectives This study aims {{to assess}} muscle fatigue for kitchen workers during various tasks in a kitchen. Material and Methods This study {{consists}} of 2 phases: a) surface electromyography (EMG) to determine muscle fatigue of trapezius and erector spinae muscles bilaterally for 12 healthy male volunteers during 30 min of Indian flatbread (chapati) preparation, b) self-administered questionnaire study after 30 min preparation {{to determine the}} impact on performance. Results Surface EMG {{results show that the}} right trapezius muscle had significantly higher fatigue during kneading, rolling and roasting tasks. Similarly, right erector spinae muscle showed significantly higher fatigue during rolling and roasting tasks. Conclusions Both phases of the study conclude that, even though the dynamic postural <b>adjustment</b> may reduce <b>fatigue</b> during the work schedule; the combination of risk factors like the repetitive task, forceful exertion and prolonged standing during working results in a high risk of developing muscle fatigue.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Many {{post-treatment}} {{cancer survivors}} experience persistent fatigue that can disrupt attempts to resume normal everyday activities after treatment. Theoretical models that aim to explain contributory factors that initiate and sustain fatigue symptoms, or {{that influence the}} efficacy of interventions for cancer-related fatigue (CrF) require testing. <b>Adjustment</b> to <b>fatigue</b> {{is likely to be}} influenced by coping behaviours that are guided by the representations of the symptom. OBJECTIVES: This paper describes the protocol for a pilot trial of a systematically and theoretically designed online intervention to enable self-management of CrF after cancer treatment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This 2 -armed randomised controlled pilot trial will study the feasibility and potential effectiveness of an online intervention. Participants will be allocated to either the online intervention (REFRESH (Recovery from Cancer-Related Fatigue)), or a leaflet comparator. PARTICIPANTS: 80 post-treatment cancer survivors will be recruited for the study. INTERVENTIONS: An 8 -week online intervention based on cognitive-behavioural therapy. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome is a change in fatigue as measured by the Piper Fatigue Scale (revised). Quality of life will be measured using the Quality of Life in Adult Survivors of Cancer Scale. Outcome measures will be collected at baseline, and at completion of intervention. RESULTS: The feasibility of trial procedures will be tested, as well as the effect of the intervention on the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study may lead {{to the development of a}} supportive resource to target representations and coping strategies of cancer survivors with CrF post-treatment. SETTING: Recruitment from general public in Ireland. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at National University of Ireland Galway in January 2013. Trial results will be communicated in a peer-reviewed journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 55763085; Pre-results. </p...|$|R

The primary aim was to investigate the occurrence of mental fatigue, characterized by mental exhaustion and long recovery time following mentally strenuous tasks, in patients with CS in remission. The secondary aim was to examine whether the newly developed parts C and D of the trail making test (TMT) are more sensitive, compared to the conventional parts A and B, to evaluate attention and executive function. This was a cross-sectional study including 51 patients with CS in remission and 51 controls. All subjects completed the self-administrated mental fatigue scale (MFS) and performed all four parts of the TMT. The patients had worse outcome on all components of the MFS except for sensitivity to noise.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{work performed}} from January to December 2005 by Argonne National Laboratory on fatigue and environmentally assisted cracking in light water reactors (LWRs). Existing statistical models for estimating the fatigue life of carbon and low-alloy steels and {{austenitic stainless steels}} (SSs) {{as a function of}} material, loading, and environmental conditions were updated. Also, the ASME Code <b>fatigue</b> <b>adjustment</b> factors of 2 on stress and 20 on life were critically reviewed to assess the possible conservatism in the current choice of the margins. An approach, based on an environmental fatigue correction factor, for incorporating the effects of LWR environments into ASME Section III fatigue evaluations is discussed. The susceptibility of austenitic stainless steels and their welds to irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking (IASCC) is being evaluated {{as a function of the}} fluence level, water chemistry, material chemistry, and fabrication history. For this task, crack growth rate (CGR) tests and slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) tests are being conducted on various austenitic SSs irradiated in the Halden boiling water reactor. The SSRT tests are currently focused on investigating the effects of the grain boundary engineering process on the IASCC of the austenitic SSs. The CGR tests were conducted on Type 316 SSs irradiated to 0. 45 - 3. 0 dpa, and on sensitized Type 304 SS and SS weld heat-affected-zone material irradiated to 2. 16 dpa. The CGR tests on materials irradiated to 2. 16 dpa were followed by a fracture toughness test in a water environment. The effects of material composition, irradiation, and water chemistry on growth rates are discussed. The susceptibility of austenitic SS core internals to IASCC and void swelling is also being evaluated for pressurized water reactors. Both SSRT tests and microstructural examinations are being conducted on specimens irradiated in the BOR- 60 reactor in Russia to doses up to 20 dpa. Crack growth rate data, obtained in the pressurized water reactor environment, are presented on Ni-alloy welds prepared in the laboratory or obtained from the nozzle-to-pipe weld of the V. C. Summer reactor. The experimental CGRs under cyclic and constant load are compared with the existing CGR data for Ni-alloy welds to determine the relative susceptibility of these materials to environmentally enhanced cracking under a variety of loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|When high {{strength}} steels are applicated in dynamically loaded structures, fatigue problems can arise. In most current design codes, the fatigue strength of {{high strength}} steels is either not discussed or determined as similar to mild steels. This assumption {{can be related}} to the dominance of the crack propagation life during in the total fatigue life when considering welded connections. Weld improvements can increase the length of the crack initiation life and thus increase the total fatigue life and may lead to a difference in fatigue strength between high strength steel and mild steels. This study focuses on the the effects of TIG-dressing on the weld toe geometry and the fatigue strength of TIG-dressed specimens. First a literature study is presented which summarizes earlier researches into the effect of TIG-dressing on fatigue strength and the behaviour of high strength steel in fatigue conditions, both in an as welded situation as after TIG-dressing. The weld toe geometry before and after TIG-dressing is determined. This leads to a extensive data set containing the geometry of the complete weld. The weld toe is then described with the aid of four parameters: weld toe radius, weld toe angle, weld height and undercut. Any influence of the static strength of the material, or any differences between rolled and cast steel are investigated. A comparison is made between the as welded specimens and TIG-dressed specimens. This changed geometry has been coupled to a changed fatigue strength with the aid of the notch stress approach. FEM analyses of the weld toe, based on measured geometries, have been carried out to determine stress concentration factors. <b>Adjustments</b> of the <b>fatigue</b> strength to account for loading mode, thickness, residual stress and mean stress have been derived from literature. A small reduction in residual stress, caused by the TIG-dressing procedure, has also been derived from literature. Fatigue tests have been carried out on 24 specimens ranging from S 460 to S 1100, made from both cast and rolled steels. The specimens are also adjusted for loading mode, thickness, residual stress and mean stress and compared with the developed model and a larger dataset of comparable as welded specimens. Due to the relatively small number of specimens per steel grade, a reliable quantitative fatigue strength improvement cannot be specified. A extensive qualitative analysis gives insight in the overall trends. From all used plates, hardness measurements are available, which have not been thoroughly analyzed. During the fatigue tests, crack dimensions have been determined during the crack propagation life. These measurements also have not been analyzed. Both data sets are added in annexes and are digitally available at the author or {{one of the members of}} the graduation committee.

40|$|Reliable {{prediction}} {{of the remaining}} service life for a conveyor chain is still an important requirement of customers {{which has not been}} solved satisfactorily up to now. The life time sensor developed through the research project “Intelligent Conveyor Chain” constitutes a new approach for long term data logging of chain loads. Fatigue assessment requires the determination of the curve for standing loads and the actual load range. As part of the accumulated damage assessment the damage arising during each individual load cycle is added up. When the total value reaches 1, this indicates a technical crack which will lead to a failure of the structural element of the chain. Determination of the remaining lifetime is based on the recording time of the associated load range data. The longer the recording time during operation the more representative is the load range data and as a result, the fatigue assessment is more reliable. Whereas the Wöhler curves have been determined experimentally {{for a wide range of}} different materials they can alternatively be estimated empirically by taking static strength values. In this case the load range has to be determined based on the original load time function of the structural element, independently from the method of fatigue assessment being used. The automotive and aircraft building industries for example have accumulated a huge amount of reliable load range data based on countless prototype tests. Non-standard manufactured products can not be tested to such a level of complexity. For these types of products the design process is limited to the use of estimated load range data. In the field of Condition Monitoring the customer increasingly demands a fatigue assessment indicating the potential service life of parts. The current market provides many different monitoring systems for measuring the load on parts. Most of these systems have to be connected by wire to the measuring point and as a result they are not appropriate for moving parts. Therefore telemetry systems which use wireless communication between the measuring point and the recording device can be used as an alternative. However the time of recording is mostly restricted by the capacity of the battery due to the high power consumption of these devices. Furthermore the space required for the batteries as well for the antennae is considerable. Such conventional telemetry systems are not suitable for installation directly into a conveyor chain. The newly developed “life time sensor” uses a novel concept which enables, for the first time, the long term data logging of chain loads for a service life of up to 3 years. The extension of service life compared to conventional telemetry has been achieved by miniaturisation of the system and the application of energy efficient components. In addition, by employing a measuring frequency matched to the operating conditions, combined with defined power saving, stand-by modes, the service life of these devices is greatly increased. With an outer diameter of about 25 mm and a length of less than 30 mm, these devices can be fitted directly into a chain conveyor link. Another advantage is the pre-processing of measurement data. Within the “life time sensor” the measured data is classified into matrix form to reduce the memory requirements. The advantage of matrix evaluated data compared to cyclic pitch data based on Rainflow counting or cycle counting Algorithms, is the consideration of the shift in the mean stress. Successful testing of the data logging, measurement data pre-processing and wireless communication has been carried out on various test installations at the company Thiele GmbH. The modified Markov matrix counting and the fatigue assessment of the conveyor chain have been verified on a test stand called “Hydropulser”. When a comparison was made between the chain link damage on the basis of the predetermined load variation and the results based on the measured load variation of the “life time sensor” they were found to match. There is a mismatch between the theoretical and the determined remaining life time due to the type of testing carried out, so that chain damage occurred at a calculated value of 0. 46. A reliable <b>adjustment</b> of the <b>fatigue</b> assessment using the relative form is feasible at a first field test in an underground longwall and not at a test stand in a predefined environment. The results of the research and development carried out in this project, have demonstrated that long term data logging combined with measurement data pre processing is possible. Determination of the actual chain load range and thus the remaining chain life is now available. The “life time sensor” offers a reliable basis for condition monitoring of chain conveyors. Further Research and development will demonstrate the possible use of these devices in other fields of application...|$|R
