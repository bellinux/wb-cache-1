5|$|On 13 December 1562, Mary {{sent for}} Knox again after {{he gave a}} sermon denouncing certain {{celebrations}} which Knox had interpreted as rejoicing {{at the expense of}} the Reformation. She charged that Knox spoke irreverently of the Queen in order to make her appear contemptible to her subjects. After Knox gave an explanation of the sermon, Mary stated that she did not blame Knox for the differences of opinion and asked that in the future he come to her directly if he heard anything <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he disliked. Despite her friendly gesture, Knox replied that he would continue to voice his convictions in his sermons and would not wait upon her.|$|E

After seeing American Tejano pop singer Selena perform at a showcase event, Torres immediately wanted to record a duet with her. He said in Selena Remembered; a documentary about her career, [...] "...she had an attractive way <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> was always present. We got along very well and a friendship developed from that point on. Several months later I wrote a song which I thought {{would be good to}} record a duet with Selena." [...] "Buenos Amigos" [...] was recorded for Torres' tenth studio album Nada Se Compara Contigo (1991).|$|E

2500|$|In 1932 {{the comic}} {{operetta}} Sissi premiered in Vienna. Composed by Fritz Kreisler, the libretto {{was written by}} Ernst and Hubert Marischka, with orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett.

2500|$|Along this theme, PBS {{commentator}} Bill Moyers {{noted that}} MSNBC commentator Tucker Carlson had said of Clinton, [...] "There's just something <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> feels castrating, overbearing, and scary," [...] and that top-rated {{radio talk show}} host Rush Limbaugh continued to refer to her as [...] "the woman with the testicle lockbox." [...] During the campaign, Carlson made repeated statements of the form [...] "When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs." [...] Further discussion ensued when the Drudge Report and a few other media outlets ran an unflattering Associated Press photograph of Clinton looking old and tired on the wintry Iowa campaign trail; Limbaugh sympathized with the plight of American women in an appearance-obsessed culture, then asked, [...] "Will this country want to actually watch a woman get older before their eyes on a daily basis?" ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{was invited}} to the wedding and met {{important}} Nazis. Through Joseph Goebbels she secured an interview with Hitler. In her article, a description of Hitler was later translated into English as: [...] "You immediately like him. He seems lonely. The eyes, showing a kind heart, stare right at you. They sparkle with force." [...] Arvad was Hitler's guest at the 1936 Summer Olympics, which led to her being investigated by the FBI in America as a potential spy. Hitler {{had told her that}} she was a perfect example of Nordic beauty. A photograph of her with Hitler surfaced and the FBI followed her, finding out that she was dating an American ensign, John F. Kennedy, son of the former U.S. ambassador to Britain. Kennedy's prominence led only to greater scrutiny of Arvad and suspicions <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> were never substantiated. Though she wrote only society news and never embraced Hitler's politics, the connection to him shadowed her professional life.|$|E
2500|$|The series finale {{picked up}} where the {{previous}} episode left off, where Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) and Bart argue on the roof ending with Bart falling off the building. Chuck and Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) leave the scene and hide from the police as Chuck is considered [...] "a person of interest" [...] in the case. Jack Bass (Desmond Harrington), Chuck's uncle, comes to help him and suggests the two get married since spousal privilege prevents a wife from unwillingly testifying against her husband. Chuck thus proposes to Blair who tearfully accepts. Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively) discovers the alternate chapter <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley) wrote and put in her bag before she left for Los Angeles. She reads the chapter and decides to stay in New York to confront Dan. William van der Woodsen (William Baldwin) shows up to support Lily Bass (Kelly Rutherford) and tells Ivy Dickens (Kaylee DeFer) that he used her {{to get back to}} Lily.|$|E
2500|$|During {{a behind-the-scenes}} video posted by Neighbours, Phillipps hinted that Daniel could find romance with {{established}} character Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow), {{who was in}} a relationship with Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) at the time. Phillipps later said that Daniel and Amber would become friends, as they bond over their shared love for photography. When Josh began to worry about Daniel's intentions towards his girlfriend, Daniel was [...] "able to put Josh at ease". He and Amber were honest about their connection and passed it off as platonic love. A few weeks later, Amber and Daniel almost shared a kiss, as she started to fall out of love with Josh. Rosenow explained that Amber was attracted to Daniel's caring side and liked how he noticed things <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Josh never had. When it became difficult for them to be apart, they spent the afternoon together, which resulted in their near kiss. With Amber feeling guilty about betraying Josh, she decided to break-up with him, but when he made a romantic gesture, she found she could not go through with it.|$|E

2500|$|Randi {{was awarded}} a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1986. The fellowship's five-year $272,000 grant helped support Randi's {{investigations}} of faith healers, including W. V. Grant, Ernest Angley, and Peter Popoff, whom Randi first exposed on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in February 1986. Hearing about his investigation of Popoff, Carson invited Randi onto his late-night TV show without seeing the evidence {{he was going to}} reveal. Carson appeared stunned after Randi showed a brief video segment from one of Popoff's broadcasts showing him calling out a woman in the audience, revealed personal information <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he claimed came from God, and then performed a laying-on-of-hands healing to drive the devil from her body. Randi then replayed the video, but with some of the sound dubbed in that he and his investigating team captured during the event using a radio scanner and recorder. Their scanner had detected the radio frequency Popoff's wife Elizabeth was using backstage to broadcast directions and information to a miniature radio receiver hidden in Popoff's left ear. That information had been gathered by Popoff's assistants, who had handed out [...] "prayer cards" [...] to the audience before the show, instructing them to write down all the information Popoff would need to pray for them.|$|E
2500|$|Church's {{personal}} life {{has often been}} portrayed in UK tabloid newspapers, inspiring the song [...] "Let's Be Alone" [...] on her album Tissues and Issues. At age 15 she was criticised for remarks she made about the behaviour {{of people in the}} aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks. At the Leveson Inquiry she stated that her comments were taken vastly out of context. In a 2006 interview with Davina McCall, she agreed being diplomatic was [...] "not in her nature". In November 2011, Church testified before the Leveson Inquiry about the media intrusion into her {{personal life}} stating [...] "I've been made a caricature for so long, and this person portrayed in the tabloids really isn't me. It's not the person I am, and it's had a massive impact on my career. As an artist, I find it hard to be taken seriously because my credibility has been blown to bits." [...] On 27 February 2012 Church accepted £600,000 in damages and costs in settlement of a lawsuit arising out of the News International phone hacking scandal. She had claimed that 33 stories <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> appeared in the News of the World were the product of illegal hacking into her family's voicemail. After the settlement was announced in open court she made a lengthy statement in which she said, [...] "I have also discovered that despite the apology which the newspaper has just given in court, these people were prepared to go to any lengths to prevent me exposing their behaviour. They are not truly sorry. They are just sorry they got caught." ...|$|E
2500|$|The story {{contains}} much social satire, targeted {{particularly at}} the two aunts. A major debate concerns whether the character of Price {{is meant to be}} ironic, a parody of the wholesome heroines that were so popular in Regency novels. William H. Magee wrote in 1966 that [...] "irony pervades if (it) does not dominate the presentation of Fanny Price." [...] By contrast, Andrew Wright argued in 1968 that Price [...] "is presented straight-forwardly, without any contradiction of any kind". Lionel Trilling maintained that Austen created Price as [...] "irony directed against irony itself". By contrast, the American English professor Nina Auerbach argued that Price was a genteel version of a popular archetype of the Romantic age; the monster who by the sheer act of existing does not and cannot ever fit into society. In Auerbach's interpretation of Price, she has more in common with the monster created by Victor Frankenstein in Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein than she does with any of the other Austen heroines or the brooding character Hamlet, who was very popular with Romantic audiences. Auerbach wrote that there is [...] "...something horrible <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> deprives the imagination of its appetite for ordinary life and compels it toward the deformed, the dispossessed." [...] Auerbach argues that Price defines herself in a negative sense, by refusing to involve herself in anything enjoyable or pleasant (such as not acting in the play Lovers’ Vows) or eating food only because she has to (and even then eating induces only nausea in her): a stern, priggish woman who watches the world around her in silent disapproval, a character who sums herself up in the line: [...] "Madam, I know not seems". Auerbach sums up Price [...] "As a woman who belongs only where she is not, Fanny is a more indigestible figure than the wistful Victorian orphans for whom embracing their kin is a secular salvation. In the tenacity with which she adheres to an identity validated by no family, home, or love, she repudiates the vulnerability of the waif to the unlovable toughness of the authentic transplant. Repelling the conventional female endowments of love and home, Fanny passes from the isolation of the outcast to that of the conqueror, aligning her rather with the Romantic hero than with the heroine of romance: her solitude is her condition, not a state from which the comedy will save her....The mobility and malleability of Mansfield Park is a dark realization of an essentially Romantic vision, of which Fanny Price represents both the horror and the best hope. Only in Mansfield Park does Jane Austen force us to experience the discomfort of a Romantic universe presided over by the potent charm of a heroine who was not made to be loved." ...|$|E
