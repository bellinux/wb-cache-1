5|$|The {{last round}} of matches, {{featuring}} {{all three of}} the teams that had qualified for finals day, determined who went directly to the final, and who would face off first in the semi-final. The Southern Vipers faced the Loughborough Lightning, and batting first <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>effort</b> saw them reach 156 for 4; Bates scored 38, Sara McGlashan got 34* and Lydia Greenway 29. Despite scores in the thirties from Perry and Evelyn Jones, a strong bowling performance from the Vipers, in which Linsey Smith and Brindle each took three wickets, saw them to victory by 59 runs. That victory guaranteed the Vipers a place in the final, while the Loughborough Lightning had to face Western Storm in a semi-final. The result of the other match that day was of no consequence to the tournament; Beth Mooney scored 56 runs for the Yorkshire Diamonds, who scored 118 runs. Anya Shrubsole finished the match with five wickets for the Western Storm, taking a four–wicket maiden in the final over of the match. Storm opening batsmen Taylor and Priest shared a 101-run partnership to take their side to the brink of victory before being dismissed from subsequent deliveries, but despite two further wickets, the Storm won by six wickets with 21 balls remaining.|$|E

After serving a period of notice and gardening leave, and with West Ham paying Reading £380,000 in compensation, he was appointed manager on 18 October 2003, their tenth manager. Pardew set out to rebuild the side bringing in Nigel Reo-Coker, Marlon Harewood and Brian Deane. In his first season in charge, they made the playoff final only to lose to Crystal Palace. His signings of Bobby Zamora, Matthew Etherington and veterans Chris Powell and Teddy Sheringham saw West Ham finishing sixth and subsequently beat Preston North End 1–0 thanks to a Zamora goal in the 2005 playoff final, securing a return to the Premier League.

Lead vocalist Eddie Vedder had made the final decisions for the albums Vitalogy and No Code; however, {{at the end of the}} No Code recording sessions, Vedder suggested to bassist Jeff Ament that it would be better for the other members to write and bring in more complete songs so Vedder would be under less pressure to finish the songs. Ament said that [...] "everybody took that to heart," [...] and O'Brien added that most of the songs came to the studio finished. Ament also said that Vedder's reaction to the rest of the band's new material kept [...] "everybody energized about their place in the band." [...] Vedder worked with the other band members on their own material before work was started on his. Guitarist Mike McCready noticed a change in Vedder's attitude during the recording of Yield, stating, [...] "I used to be afraid of him and not want to confront him on things ... We talk more now, and hang out ... He seems very, very centered now." ...|$|E

500|$|By July, {{the team}} had begun initial {{construction}} of the game's levels. Thief IIs increased focus on stealth necessitated new level design concepts: the most stealth-based missions in Thief had centered on urban burglary, but Pearsall explained that this [...] "would get tired pretty fast" [...] if repeated in every level. The team diversified Thief II by designing missions with such objectives as kidnapping, blackmail and eavesdropping. The first two levels were designed to seamlessly introduce new players to the core game mechanics, without a tutorial mission that might lose the interest of experienced players. When creating a mission, the team would often begin by deciding on the player's objective, after which they would produce a rough level design. The mission would then undergo a peer review to determine if it should {{be added to the}} game. Each of the game's levels was <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>effort</b> rather than the work of a single designer. Designer Randy Smith explained that, while Thiefs levels had been designed to fit a pre-existing story, the Thief II team [...] "tried to think of really good missions first" [...] and then adjusted the plot to suit them. He noted that it was highly difficult to harmonize the two.|$|E
500|$|The band {{received}} acclaim for {{the quality}} of their songwriting. Daniel Durchholz of Wall of Sound called Holy Wood their most ambitious and musically accomplished record to date. LA Weekly said that [...] "almost all [...] contain a double-take chord change or a textural overdose or a mind-blowing bridge, and they'll be terroristic in concert." [...] Hot Press praised the band for their inventive musical arrangements, and said that [...] "Holy Wood is a far better record than many would have dared to expect." [...] Drowned in Sound rated the album 10 out of 10 and praised the band's performance, saying that they [...] "play tighter than [...] before (looking at the credits show it to be much more of <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>effort)...</b> and, musically, it has a lot more variation and scope than the Limp Bizkits of the world." [...] The band's vocalist was also applauded for his lyricism; Barry Walters of Rolling Stone commended him for [...] "addressing real-life issues with a theatrical verve and genuine vitriol that no other mainstream act can match." [...] Billboard magazine was similarly impressed, calling Manson one of the most skilled lyricists of his generation. Revolver editor Christopher Scapelliti compared his lyrics to those of John Lennon's, writing: [...] "What comes across loudest on the album is not the music, but the sense of injury expressed in Manson's lyrics. Like Plastic Ono Band, Holy Wood screams with a primal fury that's evident even in its quietest moments." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the short}} tour for No Code, the band {{went into the}} studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The {{sessions}} for the band's fifth album represented more of <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>effort</b> between {{all members of the}} group, with Ament stating that [...] "everybody really {{got a little bit of}} their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band." [...] On February 3, 1998, Pearl Jam released its fifth album, Yield. The album was cited as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has [...] "turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten." [...] Lyrically, Yield continued with the more contemplative type of writing found on No Code, with Vedder saying, [...] "What was rage in the past has become reflection." [...] Yield debuted at number two on the Billboard charts, but like No Code soon began dropping down the charts. It included the singles [...] "Given to Fly" [...] and [...] "Wishlist". The band hired comic book artist Todd McFarlane to create an animated video for the song [...] "Do the Evolution" [...] from the album, its first music video since 1992. A documentary detailing the making of Yield, Single Video Theory, was released on VHS and DVD later that year.|$|E

By the tenth day of spring practice Boren had left the team. Boren made {{a statement to the}} press regarding his decision, which included the following excerpt: [...] "Michigan football was a family, built on mutual respect and support for each other from (former) Coach (Lloyd) Carr on down. We knew it took the entire family, <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>effort,</b> and we all worked together[...] I have great trouble accepting that those family values have eroded in just a few months[...] [...]That I am unable to perform under these circumstances at the level I expect of myself, and my teammates and Michigan fans deserve, is why I have made the decision to leave." [...] A month later, Ohio State coach Jim Tressel announced Boren would redshirt for the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season and become the first player to transfer from Michigan to play for archrival Ohio State since at least World War II. [...] According to Section 14.5.2.B of the Rules of Eligibility in the Big Ten handbook, Boren is ineligible to be a scholarship athlete after transferring. [...] A little more than a week after Justin announced his transfer, his younger brother Zach committed to Ohio State. [...] Later that summer, Detroit Free Press writer Michael Rosenberg, backed up Boren's statement about family values: [...] "Rodriguez's staff uses some of the foulest, most degrading language imaginable. I know coaches curse, and I'm no prude, but this goes way beyond a few dirty words. He belittles his players. This {{is a big part of}} why offensive lineman Justin Boren [...] left the team.

500|$|The {{anniversary of}} the game was not widely commemorated until its silver anniversary in 1987. By that time, the NBA had grown to be a popular sports league with average {{attendance}} of 13,000 fans per game and star players like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan. The Warriors' PR director Harvey Pollack said an impossible 40,000 people claimed to have seen the game, and some even testified it took place in Madison Square Garden. Chamberlain later stated {{it was one of}} his favorite games, but not the favorite: that title belonged to the match in which he grabbed an NBA record 55 rebounds against perennial rival Bill Russell. He did not want to feed the criticism that he was more interested in personal stardom than winning. Although Chamberlain won two NBA championships and was the NBA's all-time leading scorer and rebounder when he retired, he was mostly remembered as the man who had single-handedly scored 100 points in a game. Chamberlain publicly embraced the 100-point game in his final years. On a radio show commemorating the game's 31st anniversary in 1993, he said, [...] "As time goes by, I feel more a part of that 100-point game." [...] He explained that growing up on the streets, he would have been derisively labelled a gunner, a glory-hound, for attempting 63shots. [...] "You take that many shots on the playground, and no one ever wants you on their team again." [...] He said he took shots he normally would not, noting that in contests which he considered to be better he scored 50 to 60 points on around 75 percent shooting, as opposed to his 57 percent shooting in the 100-point game. He was proud that people who knew nothing about basketball would point out the game to their kids when they saw him. [...] "I know that it has been my tag. I am definitely proud of it. But it was definitely <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>effort.</b> You had {{to see some of the}} things my teammates did to get me the ball ... It was almost like a circus out there for a while." ...|$|E
