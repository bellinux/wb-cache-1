King took <b>a</b> <b>jump</b> shot that missed and Carolina's Cunningham grabbed the rebound. The Tar Heels traversed the court and Bob Young managed to score a basket to give Carolina the edge. However, North Carolina was unable to stop Kansas during the ensuing drive as Chamberlain scored a basket to bring the score to 4848. After Kansas score the tying basket, North Carolina {{proceeded}} to hold the ball for one final shot before time ran out.

5|$|Cicadas, {{unlike other}} Auchenorrhyncha, are not adapted for jumping (saltation). They have the usual insect modes of locomotion, walking and flight. However, {{they do not}} walk or run well, and take to the wing to travel {{distances}} greater than a few centimetres. Cicadas can extend their hindlegs in under a millisecond to execute <b>a</b> <b>jump,</b> implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release.|$|E

5|$|Paramount Pictures won <b>a</b> <b>jump</b> {{ball with}} Warner Bros. (parent {{companies}} Viacom and Time Warner, respectively, jointly owned Comedy Central until Time Warner exited the venture in 2003) {{to release the}} film in the United States, with Warner Bros. getting the international rights. Viacom bought all of Comedy Central in 2004, but Warner Bros. continued to distribute the film internationally.|$|E
5|$|Just like {{individual}} competitions, {{there are}} two rounds, but with a difference. Each round is divided into four rotations or 'legs', in which a member of every team jumps once in the same order. Points are scored {{the same as they}} are in individual competitions; however, an athlete's points for <b>a</b> <b>jump</b> are instead added to their team's total tally. The starting order of teams in the first round, and first three legs of the second round, is based on their standings in the Nations Cup. Teams are narrowed down to eight for the second round based on points scored, with the same four athletes jumping in their order of rotation as before.|$|E

5|$|One notable Dream Shake {{happened}} in Game 2 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. With David Robinson guarding him, Olajuwon performed a cross-over, {{drove to the}} basket and faked a layup. Robinson, an excellent defender, kept up with Olajuwon and remained planted. Olajuwon spun counterclockwise and faked <b>a</b> <b>jump</b> shot. Robinson, who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP, fell for the fake and jumped to block the shot. With Robinson in the air, Olajuwon performed an up-and-under move and made an easy layup.|$|E
5|$|Selphie was {{the second}} {{character}} that Nomura drew, after Squall, intentionally giving her an impractical hairstyle. When he first designed Selphie, Nomura drew her in overalls; however, he realized {{that none of the}} characters would be wearing a skirt. In the end, he gave Selphie a mini-skirt and let Quistis have pants. In the Kingdom Hearts series, Nomura included a younger version of Selphie as a resident of Destiny Islands, and uses <b>a</b> <b>jump</b> rope instead of nunchaku. She is voiced by Mayuko Aoki in the Japanese version, and by Molly Marlette in the English version.|$|E
5|$|The first Hispanic {{to command}} a TACLET (Tactical Law Enforcement Team), was then-Lieutenant Jose L. Rodriguez {{when he took}} command of TACLET South, 1996–1998. He {{was also the first}} Coast Guardsman to command a U.S. Marine Corps unit when he took command of the Riverine Training Center, Special Operations Training Group, II MEF at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina in July 1999. He was also the first Hispanic-American Coast Guardsman to earn his Gold Navy/Marine Corps jump wings while in the Coast Guard and {{assigned}} to <b>a</b> <b>jump</b> billet (USMC Majors Billet at Special Operations Training Group II MEF). He earned his wings that same year. He also became the first commanding officer of one of the two MSSTs commissioned in the Coast Guard.|$|E

5|$|The game {{includes}} numerous subplots which largely {{serve as}} {{means for the}} player to earn money. For example, the player can choose to locate and retrieve a stolen icon {{on behalf of a}} religious leader in exchange for a reward. Other methods to earn money include stripping the corpses of slain opponents for marketable items, killing wanted criminals to earn a reward, and attacking other vessels in space to pirate their cargo. Gameplay {{in the early stages of}} the game primarily involves activities of this nature so that the player can accumulate enough money to outfit the party with better weapons and armor and purchase <b>a</b> <b>jump</b> drive capable of propelling the party's spacecraft to other worlds crucial to obtaining the means to stop Kiefer.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{televised}} by CBS across the United States, which attracted over 17 million viewers. Georgetown jumped {{out to an}} early 1210 lead after twelve minutes of play, with eight of North Carolina's points coming from goaltending infractions by Ewing. The Hoyas entered halftime ahead by a single point, 3231. The teams traded the lead multiple times closing minutes of the second half.

5|$|Three first-half {{possessions}} deep in Detroit Lions territory led to zero Buccaneer points {{en route}} to another blowout loss. Lions receiver Jeff Chadwick took a 73-yard reception to the Buccaneers' 1-yard line when Rod Jones fell down while covering him. Jones also got beaten by Leonard Thompson on <b>a</b> <b>jump</b> ball in the end zone. Vito McKeever was outrun by Chadwick on the Lions' third score.

5|$|To {{prepare for}} a mission to {{discover}} {{the location of the}} Covenant's homeworld, SPARTAN-II soldiers are recalled to Reach. Two days before the mission was to begin, Covenant forces attack Reach and destroy the colony. A starship, the Pillar of Autumn, survives the onslaught with the SPARTAN-II Master Chief on board. The ship initiates <b>a</b> <b>jump</b> to slipspace (similar to hyperspace), hoping to lead the enemy away from Earth. The game starts with the Pillar of Autumn encountering Halo.|$|E
5|$|Although Mouton {{competed in}} only one world {{championship}} event during the season, she contested a full six-round British Rally Championship. Her campaign was plagued by reliability problems and she recorded only one finish. In the National Breakdown Rally, Mouton stopped after damaging her Quattro in <b>a</b> <b>jump.</b> After technical problems led to an early retirement at the Circuit of Ireland, she finished second at the Welsh Rally behind Malcolm Wilson in another Quattro. At the Scottish Rally, Mouton had been {{closing in on the}} leading Wilson until a transmission problem forced her to retire. At the Ulster Rally, she set the fastest time for the first stage but then dropped out with a mechanical failure. In the season-ending Manx International Rally, Mouton struggled to start her Quattro and then crashed out five stages later.|$|E
