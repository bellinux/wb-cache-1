40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this paper}} was to present methods of {{placement}} of artificial <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> in edentulous individuals. The following review takes account of the majority of papers published during the last 100 years. The review has been divided into sections regarding the method used to determine the position of artificial <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> Geometric aspect Gysi (1895 - 1920) produced the first scientific theory about the position of artificial <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> Physiognomic theory The {{aim of this}} theory is to find the most natural position for artificial <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> for each individual. Camper's "face angle" as a physiognomic criterion, has been introduced in papers of Wehrli (1961), Marxhors (1966), Tanzer (1968), Lombardi (1973). Esthetic aspect Important names in the field of dental esthetics are: Schön and Singer (1961), Arnheim (1965), Krajiček (1969), Tanzer (1968), Lombardi (1973), Goldstein (1976). They have introduced principles of visual aspects for selection of contours, dimension and position of artificial <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> Constitution aspect Flagg (1880), Williams (1913) and Hrauf (1957, 1958), have considered body constitution and individual characteristics regarding position of artificial <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> Physiological theory In 1971, Marxhors pointed {{to the fact that the}} position of artificial teeth corresponds with the function of the surrounding soft tissue and from the aspect of physiognomy as well. Phonetic aspect According to Silverman (1962) artificial <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> are nearest when we pronounce the sound "S". Cephalometrical research Rayson (1970), Watson (1989), Strajnić Lj. (1999), Bassi F. (2001) have presented cephalometric radiographic analyses of natural <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> compared with cephalometric radiographic analyses of artificial <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> A review of dental literature shows several factors suggesting modalities which should determine the position of artificial <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> Numerous methods have been designed for evaluation of the position of artificial <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> However, there is no universally reliable method regarding determination of the position of artificial <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{visibility}} of <b>anterior</b> <b>tooth</b> surfaces with lips at rest or during function {{is an important}} factor in determining prosthodontic outcome. There is a lack of sufficient information published on this subject. The aim of this study was to investigate the degree of {{visibility of}} maxillary and mandibular <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> surfaces when the lips are at rest. Four hundred seventy three adults were examined. All the subjects had maxillary and mandibular <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> present with no caries, restorations, severe attrition, mobility, extrusion, or obvious deformities. The portions of <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> that were visible were measured vertically using a Boley gauge from the border of the lip to the incisal edge for the incisors and to the cusp tip for the canines. The measurement was taken at the midpoint of the tooth when the lips and lower jaw were at the rest position. The length of the upper lip was measured from the base of the columella to the tip of the philtrum at the midline of the face. Males showed more of the maxillary lateral, canine, and mandibular <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> than females. With increasing age, the amount of maxillary <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> that was visible at rest decreased. The subjects with shorter upper lips displayed more maxillary central incisor structure than those with longer upper lips. Racial differences were not found. The amount of visible portions of <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> is determined by muscle positions that vary from person to another. It provides an excellent starting point for vertical positioning <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> that can be modified as necessary in any clinical situation. The findings of this study should help the dentist in providing aesthetic prosthodontic treatment that involves replacement of <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> A useful guideline for positioning <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> is suggested.

40|$|Statement of Problem. One of the {{difficult}} aspects of complete denture prosthodontics is the selection of appropriately sized maxillary <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> Many {{attempts have been made}} to establish methods of estimating the combined width of maxillary <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> and/or central incisors. Purpose. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether a relationship exists between the intercanthal dimension and 4 mesiodistal width combinations of the maxillary <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> Material and Methods. The maxillary <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> of 443 adult subjects were examined. Intercanthal distance was measured between the median angles of the palpebral fissure. The mean widths of the 2 central incisors, the combined widths of the central incisors, the combined width of the 4 incisors, and the combined width of the 6 <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> were determined intraorally at their widest dimension. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the relationship between intercanthal distance and the 4 measurements of maxillary <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> (α=. 05). Results. Although the Pearson correlation coefficients were relatively small, a significant relationship existed between intercanthal dimension and the 4 maxillary teeth dimensions (P<. 0001). It was found that biometric ratios of 1 : 0. 267 and 1 : 1. 426 could be used to estimate the central incisor width and the combined widths of the 6 <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> respectively. Conclusion. Within the limitations of this study, the results suggest that intercanthal distance can be used as a preliminary method for determining the width of the maxillary <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> for edentulous patients.

40|$|AbstractThe Anterior Dental Loading Hypothesis {{states that}} the unique Neanderthal facial and dental anatomy was an {{adaptive}} response to the regular application of heavy forces resulting from both the masticatory and cultural use of the <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> Heavy <b>anterior</b> <b>tooth</b> wear frequently observed in Neanderthal specimens is cited as a main source of evidence for heavy forces being applied to these teeth. From this, it might be predicted that the wear shown on the <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> of Neanderthals would greatly exceed that of the posterior teeth and that this differential would be greater than in other hominins with different facial morphologies. In this paper, a new method of examining tooth wear patterns is used to test these predictions in a large assemblage of Late Pleistocene hominins {{and a group of}} recent hunter–gatherers from Igloolik, Canada. The results show that all Late Pleistocene hominins, including Neanderthals, had heavily worn <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> relative to their posterior teeth but, contrary to expectations, this was more pronounced in the modern humans than in the Neanderthals. The Igloolik Inuit showed heavier <b>anterior</b> <b>tooth</b> wear relative to their posterior teeth than any Late Pleistocene hominins. There was, however, a characteristic Neanderthal pattern in which wear was more evenly spread between <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> than in modern humans. Overall, the evidence presented here suggests that all Late Pleistocene hominins habitually applied heavy forces between their <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> and that Neanderthals were not exceptional in this regard. These results therefore does not support the Anterior Dental Loading Hypothesis...|$|R
