James II, however, backed by Louis XIV of France, still considered himself king by divine right and maintained it was not within parliament's prerogative to depose a monarch.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>Mary</b> was {{an infant}} when she {{inherited}} the throne, Scotland was ruled by regents until she became an adult.

Beaton's claim {{was based on a}} version of the late king's will that his opponents dismissed as a forgery.

5|$|As the {{tradition}} of classical Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge. While Classical poetry used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century, the vernacular continued to develop. In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used syllabic metre, vernacular poets tended to use stressed metre. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role, as the verse was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women, such <b>as</b> <b>Mary</b> MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615–1707).|$|E

This prompts Mary Margaret to submit her letter of resignation as a volunteer at the hospital.|$|E

5|$|Series co-creator Chris Fedak {{stated in}} a later {{interview}} that the inspiration for Volkoff's true identity being a gun-shy British scientist was Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Gregory Tuttle, Volkoff's guise <b>as</b> <b>Mary</b> Elizabeth Bartowski's MI6 handler, in his first appearance on the series. A photograph of Dalton before his portrayal of James Bond is used to represent a young Hartley Winterbottom.|$|E
