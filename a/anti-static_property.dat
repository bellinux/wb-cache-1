40|$|Low {{temperature}} {{plasma treatment}} {{has been conducted}} in textile industry and has some success in the dyeing and finishing processes. In this paper, {{an attempt was made}} to apply low temperature plasma treatment to improve the <b>anti-static</b> <b>property</b> of polyester fabric. The polyester fabrics were treated under different conditions using low temperature plasma. An Orthogonal Array Testing Strategy was employed to determine the optimum treatment condition. After low temperature plasma treatment, the polyester fabrics were evaluated with different characterisation methods. Under the observation of scanning electron microscope, the surface structure of low temperature plasma-treated polyester fabric was seriously altered. This provided more capacity for polyester to capture moisture and hence increase the dissipation of static charges. The relationship between moisture content and half-life decay time for static charges was studied and the results showed that the increment of moisture content would result in shortening the time for the dissipation of static charges. Moreover, there was a great improvement in the <b>anti-static</b> <b>property</b> of the low temperature plasma-treated polyester fabric after comparing with that of the polyester fabric treated with commercial anti-static finishing agent.

40|$|Polyacrylonitrile fiber {{is often}} {{difficult}} to wet due to its low surface energy, advanced crystallinity and orientation. The inherent poor absorbency, accompanied by the high build-up of static charges limits its further development. Many methods have been used to improve the poor <b>anti-static</b> <b>property</b> of polymer materials, including the addition of surfactants, blending and copolymerization of hydrophilic monomers, physical modification and chemical oxidation reaction [1 – 4]. For example, physical modification can change the geometry of the fibers from a round shape to other shapes because multilobal cross sections improve the fiber wicking quality. Protein additives can be used for mod-ification of polyacrylonitrile fibers. Hydrophilic and anti-static properties of polymer materials can be improved by grafting hydrophilic monomers into the polymer matrix [5...|$|E

30|$|Between the {{two common}} types of fabric {{softeners}} for home laundering (rinse cycle softener and dryer sheet softener), the dryer sheet softener is more popular in US households (over 60 % of households) (American Association on Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) 2012). Dryer sheet softeners, which {{were introduced to}} the US market in the early 1970 s (Williams 1982), are fabric softeners saturated onto sheets of a non-woven fabric or polyurethane foam. Compared with rinse cycle softeners, dryer sheet softeners provide better <b>anti-static</b> <b>properties,</b> air permeability retention, water absorbency retention, and whiteness retention (Chen-Yu et al. 2009; Williams 1982; Wilson 1987). Dryer sheet softeners also form smaller pills and have no effect on flammability (Chen-Yu et al. 2008; Chiweshe and Crews 2000). However, dryer sheet softeners tend to have uneven softener deposition and are less effective in softening fabrics (Williams 1982). Although many households use fabric softeners during home laundering, no study comparing conventional and HE washers has included a fabric softener.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>anti-static</b> and {{anti-radiation}} <b>properties</b> {{of functional}} fabrics containing stainless steel microfilament were investigated in this paper. Three specifications {{of stainless steel}} microfilaments (diameter: 0. 035 mm、 0. 040 mm and 0. 050 mm) and cotton yarn were twist into composite yarns. The functional fabrics were woven by cotton yarn as warp, both cotton and the composite yarn as weft. The fabric performances were tested after woven and some treatments, especially the <b>anti-static</b> and anti-radiation <b>properties.</b> The results showed that with stainless steel microfilament increases in fabric, the amount of electrostatic charge on fabric becomes smaller.

The total statistical figure of patient in today‘s world acquiring infections during their hospital stay is frightening {{and one of}} the important reasons for that is lack of guaranteed barrier materials. Plasma treatments can answer the demand of textile industry. Besides the base function of dressing people, textiles contribute to human health and safety, protecting from exposure to dangerous environments. Important requirements for protective apparel are barrier effectiveness and comfort for the wearer. Bamboo species the advantage of bamboo as a raw material include its fast renewability, its biodegradability and its organic status. The advantages of bamboo fabric are its antimicrobial properties, better moisture management and <b>anti-static</b> <b>properties.</b> These advantages make bamboo an ideal choice for application in medical textiles compared to other fibres.

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is {{conducting}} a program of research to evaluate and improve remote mine seal construction technology for mine fire control and suppression. The main focus of this work is to develop reliable technology that will remotely seal a mine opening from floor-to-roof and rib-to-rib. NIOSH, in partnership with Strata Mine Services Inc. 1, is evaluating the capability of a two-component phenolic foam-based product, called Rocsil 21, that is intended for cavity filling, air and gas sealing, and consolidation of highly fractured strata. Rocsil 2 can be rapidly applied, has a quick cure time, a high expansion rate, good compressive resistance and excellent <b>anti-static</b> <b>properties.</b> When the resin and catalyst are mixed, an immediate foaming reaction occurs followed by rapid expansion up to 30 times the original volume.

40|$|Significant {{opportunities}} {{exist in}} both the scientific and industrial sectors {{for the development of}} novel multi-functional materials that combine the inherent properties of all precursor components in a synergistic manner, thereby providing new products and opportunities. Processes that add value to natural materials in a facile and refined manner are particularly sought after. Thus this research combines useable substrates, notably natural protein fibres and minerals with gold or silver nanoparticles, producing high value, multi-functional materials that display the strength, softness and shine (of the protein fibres), or high surface area and dispersibility (of the minerals) with the high value and wealth associated with the noble metal nanoparticles, their broad spectrum of intense colours, anti-microbial, insecticide and <b>anti-static</b> <b>properties.</b> This adds significant worth to the substrates, transforming them from commodities to valuable materials. Silk, merino wool and crossbred wool were the natural fibres employed kaolinite and halloysite clays the minerals. They were combined with gold and silver nanoparticles of various sizes and shapes (and hence colours) producing the following composite materials: • Gold nanoparticle-merino wool composites • Gold nanoparticle-crossbred wool composites • Gold nanoparticle-silk composites • Silver nanoparticle-kaolinite composites • Silver nanoparticle-halloysite composites The most successful method for producing silver nanoparticle-clay composites involved the external preparation of silver nanoparticles and their subsequent attachment to the clay substrates by means of a layer-by-layer deposition approach, which capitalised on electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes capping the nanoparticles and bound to the clay surfaces. Three general approaches were employed in the production of the gold nanoparticle-natural fibre composite materials. The nanoparticles were either synthesised ex-situ and subsequently attached to the fibres, or the natural fibres were utilised as redox active biotemplates in which the wool or silk absorbed and subsequently reduced Au³⁺ to nanoparticulate Au⁰ on and within the fibres. Thirdly, a seed mediated growth approach was employed in which additional Au³⁺ was reduced to nanoparticulate Au⁰ on the surface of gold nanoparticles already bound to the fibres. This was facilitated by an external reductant...|$|R
