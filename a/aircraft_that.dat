5|$|Although the ZNDH was {{now able}} to mount a {{credible}} threat against the insurgents, by then a new menace was arriving {{from the other side}} of the Adriatic.

The ZNDH's 3rd Flak Group, defending Brod na Savi (Slavonski Brod), managed to shoot down a single bomber en route to its target. The best <b>aircraft</b> <b>that</b> the ZNDH could put up to defend its homeland at the end of 1943 were 20 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s, 10 Fiat G.50s, six Fiat CR.42s, five Avia BH-33s and two Ikarus IK-2 fighters – <b>aircraft</b> <b>that</b> had been obsolete in 1940.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{operation}} {{had been a}} failure, it demonstrated the range, flexibility and possibilities of airborne forces and glider operations, and also highlighted equipment failures that were rectified for later operations.
