40|$|Thrust {{bearings}} {{are designed}} to support the axial loads generated by the rotating component of turbomachinary like turbocharger and turboexpander. Aerodynamic gas thrust bearing like tilting pad, tapered pad, grooved has been successfully designed and developed. Previously it was difficult and costly to generate spiral grooves but now it easily be developed with laser machining process. Current research target to design and develop an alternative aerodynamic grooved thrust bearing with spiral pattern to find pressure profile, load carrying capacity and friction coefficient etc. In this analysis Reynolds Equation is solved by using the Finite Difference Method (FDM) to get the pressure distribution {{over the surface of}} the spiral grooved bearing. After the pressure distribution is known, load carrying capacity and friction coefficient is calculated and their variation with different parameters are presented. The suitability of designed bearing is checked for the designed turboexpander. Here the resultant <b>axial</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>load</b> is calculated for the designed micro turboexpander and this <b>axial</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>load</b> is compared with the load carrying capacity of the designed bearing. The author believe that the detail and procedural analysis will help the researchers to design and develop more alternative gas bearing for micromachinary like turbocharger and turboexpander etc...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is researching the magnetic bearings {{to use it as a}} better alternative to conventional bearings. This research was to develop an axial thrust electromagnetic bearing for high performance jet engines. This electromagnetic bearing, rotating at high speed, must be able to handle a significant amount of <b>axial</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>load</b> in a high temperature environment. The primary struggle to design such a bearing was to overcome the centrifugal stresses developed in the rotor. In usual practice, the rotor is attached to the shaft by interference fit. This adds more stress on the rotor. Both types of stresses are maximum at the same spot on the inner radius of the rotor disk. It makes the situation worse. The thesis incorporates the finite element modeling of the rotor rotating at high speed with other boundary conditions on it. The rotor stress was modeled with and without interference fit. The interference fit was also varied. As a requirement of the grant, it was necessary to check two different rotors with different inner diameter. Engineering design handbook formulae were used to cross check the finite element analysis. A concept was developed to build a test rig to do performance analysis of the thrust bearing...|$|E

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to the more conventional squeeze-film bearing damper designs, a Viton- 70 shear-mounted, elastomeric damper was built and tested in a T- 55 power turbine high-speed balancing rig.

40|$|This thesis report {{elucidates}} {{the experimental}} and analytical methods {{of determining the}} <b>axial</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>loads</b> of a twin scroll turbocharger mounted on a 6 -cylinder diesel engine, tested at Scania CV AB, Sodertalje. Literature survey revealed several methods to experimentally determine the <b>thrust</b> <b>loads</b> but the concept of using strain gauges was nally selected. The key objectives of this thesis are to determine an experimental method to measure <b>axial</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>loads,</b> develop an analytical model to predict axial loads and to perform a root cause analysis. It was noted that axial load peaks are of immense interest here than the average values of the axial loads. The method adopted to measure axial loads consists of a weakened bearing that was capable of withstanding an estimated axial load {{and at the same}} time undergo strains that could be sensed by strain gauges. The test operating points consisted of a series of engine speeds and loads. Root cause analysis results suggested that there was a minimal drift of 0. 25 N force per 10 degree rise in temperature on the bearings. Also, the main reason for the drift in strain gauge measurements was the plastic deformation of the axial bearing that experienced higher axial loads due to transient testing. A 1 D model based on the Control Volume approach including both the pressure and impulse contributions predicting the <b>thrust</b> <b>loads</b> was modelled. The factored axial force measurements during most of the operating conditions were negative (forces acting from the turbine towards the compressor) with the highest value recorded as - 90 N at 1400 rpm and 80 % engine load. The highest factored axial force (negative) predicted by the model during the same operating point was - 100 N. The di erence between the predicted and measured max load varied between 10 % to 15 % among all the operating conditions considered for correlation. It could be concluded that the experimental method established could be used to measure axial loads. Further, future work in terms of non-invasive measurements, CFD methods and usage of fast pressure sensors on compressor side to predict transient conditions would improve the current method.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis {{was to assess the}} {{performance}} of a full scale Horizontal Axis Tidal Turbine (HATT), using the CFD package, FluentrM, and measured high shear tidal profiles. Two sites are considered: the Anglesey Skerries and a site in the Severn Estuary, both off the Welsh coast. In order to achieve this aim a number of key steps were performed including the use of an existing laboratory scale prototype HATT to establishing the optimum blade pitch angle and provide an experimental data set. Once established the HATT CFD model was used to scale up from the laboratory scale to 30 m diameter. By the use of non-dimensionalised characteristics of power, thrust and torque coefficients, it was shown that the HATT was scaleable and independent of Reynolds number. Using these findings a suitable turbine diameter was determined for site specific analysis. Velocity profiles from the two sites were obtained via vessel mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) surveys. These data were used to define a high velocity shear environment. When non-dimensionalised these data were found to also collapse onto the scaling curves provided a true average for the velocity, across the swept area, is used. In addition, when the HATT was 'positioned' at varying depths down the water column the power extraction was shown to reduce considerably with depth. When positioned close to the seabed, the cyclic torque, power and <b>axial</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>loads</b> were studied with and without a stanchion positioned downstream of the turbine. The presence of a stanchion was also shown to significantly increase the amplitude of the cyclic torque, power and <b>axial</b> <b>thrust</b> during rotation. The findings of this thesis suggest that the complexity of the dynamic torque, power and <b>axial</b> <b>thrust,</b> along with the wake profile, are influenced by the HATT's interaction with the ocean seabed. These complexities are therefore of prime importance when considering a deep water application which encompasses all or part of a high velocity shear regime. The work presented in the thesis shows {{that it is possible to}} predict a turbine's performance (for a given geometry) for any scale and velocity profile, from a single diameter. When positioned lower in the water column, the downstream wake also showed a high level of asymmetry which was also shown to influence the upstream flow field...|$|R
