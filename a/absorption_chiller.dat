Compared to electrically powered chillers, an <b>absorption</b> <b>chiller</b> has very low electrical power requirements - very rarely above 15 kW combined consumption for both the solution pump and the refrigerant pump.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel {{energy storage system}} which stores excessive {{energy in the form}} of compressed air and thermal heat. It is different from the conventional compressed air energy storage (CAES) technology in that the new system allows trigeneration of electrical, heating and cooling power in energy releasing process. Uniquely, the cooling power from this system is generated by direct expansion of compressed air instead of the use of <b>absorption</b> <b>chilling</b> technology. In addition, the system can meet the end users' demands for electricity, and heating and cooling powers through controlling the inlet pressure and temperature of an air based expander. A new parameter, the comprehensive efficiency, is proposed to evaluate the performance of the trigeneration system. Energy requirements of a small office building located in Chicago is used for the evaluation. The results show that the comprehensive efficiency of the system is very high (similar to 50 %) in winter months when no cooling is needed. In summer months, due to the high power consumption in air compression process and inefficient expansion of the compressed air (for cooling power production) the comprehensive efficiency decreases to about 30 %. However such a value is still higher than the conventional trigeneration system based on <b>absorption</b> <b>chilling</b> technology. The system is therefore very promising for practical applications particularly for the use of renewable energy due to good flexibility and simple configuration.

The practical form of heat recovery can be done by coupling the heat power plant or boiler to a gas turbine-generator and the waste steam from outlet of gas turbine can be directed to a steam turbine through a heat exchanger for secondary power generation.

The thermodynamic properties of the R 22 -E 181 are given in a new set of equations using extended experimental data from the literature. A step-by-step calculation model was established in order to predict the characteristic points of the thermodynamic cycle of the R 22 -E 181 ARU and to simulate its performance. The influence of the ambient conditions on the operation of the ARU is shown graphically when the saturated condensing temperature ranges from 30 to 45 degreesC. Regression analysis is carried out to express the actual coefficient of performance and the cooling load as functions of the condenser temperature and the absorber-condenser temperature difference. According to ARI Standard 560 - 2000 for an <b>absorption</b> water <b>chilling</b> package, it has been found that the integrated part-load value of the COP ranges from 53 to 60 %. When the saturated condensing temperature is 41. 1 degreesC, the saturated evaporating temperature is 4 degreesC and the ABS/COND temperature difference ranges from 6 to 9 degreesC.

The system data collected includes energy delivered (fluid temperatures and flow rates) and site meteorological conditions, such as solar insolation and ambient temperature.

Much of this pipeline system is in disrepair and is nearing the end of its useful life, and the boilers which supply it are old and often inefficient. In 1993, Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) proposed to SERDP a three-year effort to develop advanced systems of coupled diesel cogenerators and absorption chillers which would be particularly useful in providing a continuation of the services now provided by increasingly antiquated district systems. In mid-February, 1995, BNL learned that all subsequent funding for our program had been canceled. BNL staff continued to develop the Program Plan and to adhere to the requirements of the Execution Plan, but began to look for ways in which the work could be made relevant to Navy and DoD energy needs even without the extensive development plan formerly envisioned. The entire program was therefore re-oriented to look for ways in which small scale cogeneration and <b>absorption</b> <b>chilling</b> technologies, available through procurement rather than development, could provide some solutions to the problem of deteriorated district heating systems. The result is, we believe, a striking new approach to the provision of building services on military bases: in many cases, serious study should be made of the possibility that the old district heating system should be removed or abandoned, and small-scale cogenerators and absorption chillers should be installed in each building. In the remainder of this Summary, we develop the rationale behind this concept and summarize our findings concerning the conditions under which this course of action would be advisable and the economic benefits which will accrue if it is followed.

Using cogeneration systems to provide electricity, hot water and chilled water for hotels and hospital buildings {{seems to be a}} perfectly logical solution. The principle of cogeneration systems is simple and the technology is both well known and reliable.

In Sri Lanka, huge quantity of money is expended to import petroleum fuels for transportation, industrial, etc., and power generation purposes. Last year in Sri Lanka thermal power generation was recorded more than 60 % of total power generations. However in thermal power generation, efficiency is normally less than 35 %. Since cogeneration systems could produce electricity, hot water & chilled water, the overall efficiency could be more than 80 %. To implement a cogeneration system in three star class hotels in this study, information and data was collected from several hotels in relation to the monthly total power consumption, annual occupancy and number of guest rooms. All of these hotels operate alike and are similar to the three star class hotel operations. Based on the collected data and information three different scenarios for the proper analysis have been considered. As a result of this cogeneration system, hotel saves 2, 078 kWh electricity units per day and capital cost increased 25. 7 million rupees, which can be recovered in less than the three years’ time.
