40|$|We have {{designed}} and built electrostatically actuated microvalves compatible with integration into a PDMS based microfluidic system. The key innovation for electrostatic actuation was the incorporation of carbon nanotubes into the PDMS valve membrane, allowing for electrostatic charging of the PDMS layer and subsequent discharging, while still allowing for significant distention of the valveseat for low voltage control of the system. Nanoparticles were applied to semi-cured PDMS using a stamp transfer method, and then cured fully to make the valve seats. DC actuation in air of these valves yielded operational voltages as low as 15 V, by using a supporting structure above the valve seat that allowed sufficient restoring forces to be applied while not enhancing actuation forces to raise the valve actuation potential. Both <b>actuate</b> <b>to</b> open and <b>actuate</b> <b>to</b> close valves have been demonstrated, and integrated into a microfluidic platform, and demonstrated fluidic control using electrostatic valves...|$|E
40|$|The digital {{radiator}} {{technology is}} one of three variable heat rejection technologies being investigated for future human-rated NASA missions. The digital radiator concept is based on a mechanically pumped fluid loop with parallel tubes carrying coolant to reject heat from the radiator surface. A series of valves <b>actuate</b> <b>to</b> start and stop fluid flow to di erent combinations of tubes, in order to vary the heat rejection capability of the radiator by a factor of 10 or more. When the flow in a particular leg is stopped, the fluid temperature drops and the fluid can freeze, causing damage or preventing flow from restarting. For this reason, the liquid in a stopped leg must be partially or fully evacuated upon shutdown. One of the challenges facing fluid evacuation from closed tubes arises from the vapor generated during pumping to low pressure, which can cause pump cavitation and incomplete evacuation. Here we present a series of laboratory experiments demonstrating fluid evacuation techniques to overcome these challenges by applying heat and pumping to partial vacuum. Also presented are results from qualitative testing of the freezing characteristics of several different candidate fluids, which demonstrate significant di erences in freezing properties, and give insight to the evacuation process...|$|E
40|$|Inspired by {{hypotheses}} of Resistive Force Theory, {{a general}} dimensionless form for granular locomotion has been discovered, which instructs how to scale size, mass, and driving parameters to relate dynamic behaviors of different locomotors {{in the same}} granular media. These scalings are experimentally confirmed with wheel pairs of various shapes and sizes under many driving conditions in a common sand bed. How the relations may be derived alternatively by assuming Coulombic yielding and how the relations can be augmented to predict wheel performance in different ambient gravities is also explained. Next, a rotating-flap wheel that consists of a central hub connected to five flaps that can <b>actuate</b> <b>to</b> a certain angle open was designed, built, and tested. Experiments were completed on the wheel by performing {{a series of tests}} varying the angle of the flaps and the drawbar force the wheel tows. The results indicate a trend toward higher velocities and powers at larger flap angles. Conversely, with larger drawbar forces the trend indicates lower velocities and higher powers. A MATLAB simulation was also created to model granular locomotion with different wheel shapes, including the rotating-flap wheel. Finally, future work extending the analysis of the rotating-flap wheel to encompass a "smart" wheel that is able to actuate given certain external conditions is discussed. by James Slonaker.

This project gives a guide of the optimal temperature and humidity values of the whole process, but the prototype has been designed to permit variations of the process, so this is not only a prototype for the values gives, but a prototype for new experiments and new values First of all, the state of art and the composting process will be analyzed.

40|$|Ultra-compact is a {{valuable}} property in designs of assistive devices for people with Duchenne Muscle Dystrophy. Reducing the size of these medical devices will increase the cosmetic appearance. Current devices are large and stigmatizing {{in the eyes of}} the users. In other words, the users want a device to be small enough to be worn underneath the clothes, so it becomes unnoticeable. Additionally, they want the device to adjust the amount of assistance to the progression of their disease. The goals of this study are (1) to design an elbow joint for an unnoticeable eating assistive device meeting the growing demands of the users and (2) to evaluate this design based on performance indicators. In order to reach these goals, two evolving fields of study are brought together that have great potential to reduce the size of exoskeletons: smart materials and compliant rotational joints. This study presents the design of an ultra-compact actuated rotational joint that can be used in an eating assistive device. An antagonistic actuator is made from shape memory alloy muscle wires. It is able to carry an external load and to <b>actuate</b> <b>to</b> move to different positions. A compliant rotational joint is optimised to balance the weight of the arm. In addition, it is used to auto-align with the elbow joint. The device supports the user passively at an early stage of the disease. The passive support is increased as the disease progresses by increasing the amount of stacked leaf springs. When the muscles have deteriorated too much for full passive support, the antagonistic SMA actuator is added for active support. The device generates a stall torque of 7. 22 10 ^ 3 Nm/m^ 3 and produces a work density of $ 7. 70 10 ^ 3 J/m^ 3 based on isolating volumes and the efficiency of the whole system is 3. 9 %.

40|$|The {{research}} area {{is situated in}} the Demak, Jepara, Pati and Kudus regencies of the CentralJava Province. The objectives of the research are: (1) {{the investigation of the}} geomorphologic development of the Muria Palaeo-Strait in Central Java and (2) the analysis of the morphodynamicsof the WulanDelta. A morphographic- morphogeneticapproach was used to interpret the genesJsand subsequent evolution of the coastal lowlands in the surroundings of the Muria Volcano. The data analysis techniques, based on cause-effect assessment and analogy, were implemented in four steps, such as: (a) descriptive, (b) comparative,. (c) associative and (d) causative stages. The results of the research can be summarized as follows: The coastal plain situated to the south of the Muria Volcano was originally a shallow strait and subsequently became a mangrovecovered tidal flat with many creeks. Ultimately this tidal flat evolved into an alluvial/coastal plain with natural levees and back swamps. The coastal area in the west was still inundated by the sea around 6, 000 yrs BP. This is evidenced by the 14 C-dating 6, 530 + 120 yrs BP of a coral reef situated at 25 cms a. s. l. The present beach ridge has an age 4, 600 + 100 yrs BP and originated as a barrier bar. The coastal area in the east is characterized by the occurrence of four sequential beach ridge complexes at elevations of 580, 520, 220 and 125 cms respectively. They have been 14 C-dated 5, 860 + 110 yrs BP, 5, 090 + 100 yrs BP, 3, 530 + 100 yrs BP and 1, 760 + 120 yrs BP. Since 1, 760 yrs BP nofurther beach ridges wereformed, a tidal flat developed instead. The shape of the Wulan Delta changed from <b>actuate</b> <b>to</b> digit ate in the period of 1925 - 1995, mainly due to human interference with the river for purposes of irrigation. The growth of the Wulan Delta affected the hydro dynamical situation offshore of Jepara.
