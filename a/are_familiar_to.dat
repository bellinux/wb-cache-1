25|$|Some of {{the figures}} on the poles {{constitute}} symbolic reminders of quarrels, murders, debts, and other unpleasant occurrences about which the Native Americans prefer to remain silent... The most widely known tales, {{like those of the}} exploits of Raven and of Kats who married the bear woman, <b>are</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> almost every native of the area. Carvings which symbolize these tales are sufficiently conventionalized to be readily recognizable even by persons whose lineage did not recount them as their own legendary history.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} form of degradation, however, is a {{decrease}} in polymer chain length. Mechanisms which break polymer chains <b>are</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> biologists because of their effect on DNA: ionizing radiation (most commonly ultraviolet light), free radicals, and oxidizers such as oxygen, ozone, and chlorine. Ozone cracking is a well-known problem affecting natural rubber for example. Plastic additives can slow these process very effectively, and {{can be as simple as}} a UV-absorbing pigment (e.g. titanium dioxide or carbon black). Plastic shopping bags often do not include these additives so that they break down more easily as ultrafine particles of litter.|$|E
25|$|A static {{electric}} charge can be created whenever two surfaces contact and separate, {{and at least one}} of the surfaces has a high resistance to electric current (and is therefore an electrical insulator). The effects of static electricity <b>are</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> most people because people can feel, hear, and even see the spark as the excess charge is neutralized when brought close to a large electrical conductor (for example, a path to ground), or a region with an excess charge of the opposite polarity (positive or negative). The familiar phenomenon of a static shock–more specifically, an electrostatic discharge–is caused by the neutralization of charge.|$|E

25|$|Acoustic stethoscopes <b>are</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> most people, {{and operate}} on the {{transmission}} of sound from the chest piece, via air-filled hollow tubes, to the listener's ears. The chestpiece usually consists of two sides that can be placed against the patient for sensing sound; a diaphragm (plastic disc) or bell (hollow cup). If the diaphragm {{is placed on the}} patient, body sounds vibrate the diaphragm, creating acoustic pressure waves which travel up the tubing to the listener's ears. If the bell is placed on the patient, the vibrations of the skin directly produce acoustic pressure waves traveling up to the listener's ears. The bell transmits low frequency sounds, while the diaphragm transmits higher frequency sounds. This two-sided stethoscope was invented by Rappaport and Sprague {{in the early part of}} the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} get to some of the items and {{progress}} through the game, Bart must use equipment such as rockets and cherry-bombs, which are bought with coins that can be collected by getting rid of aliens. Bart is controlled by the player both on foot and on a skateboard. To get rid of aliens, which are disguised as real humans, he needs to jump on their heads, although some are just regular humans. The game increases in difficulty for every level, and Bart meets up with a boss {{at the end of the}} first four. The levels <b>are</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> fans of The Simpsons and some of the television humor appears in the game: for example, in the first level Bart can make a prank call to the bartender Moe in order for him to run outside so that the player can spray paint his purple apron (an example of an item that the aliens need) into a red color that the aliens do not want. The game also includes some minigames.|$|E
25|$|Screens {{made up of}} {{labyrinths}} {{of complicated}} joinery, consisting of multitudes of tiny balusters connecting hexagons, squares or other forms, with the flat surfaces constantly enriched with small carvings, <b>are</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> every one. In Cairo we also have examples in the mosque of Qous (12th century) of that finely arranged geometrical interlacing of curves with foliage terminations which distinguishes the Saracenic designer. Six panels in the Victoria and Albert Museum (13th century), {{and work on the}} tomb of the sultan Li Ghoury (16th century), show how deeply this form of decoration was ingrained in the Arab nature. Figure work and animals were sometimes introduced, in medieval fashion, as in the six panels just referred to, and at the hflpital du Moristan (13th century) and the mosque of El Nesfy Qeycoun (14th century). There is a magnificent panel on the door of Beyt-el-Emyr. This exquisite design is composed of vine leaves and, grapes of conventional treatment in low relief. The Arab designer was fond of breaking up his paneling in a way reminding one of a similar Jacobean custom. The main panel would be divided into a number of hexagonal, triangular or other shapes, and each small space filled in with conventional scroll work. Much of this simple flat design reminds one of that Byzantine method from which the Elizabethan carvers were inspired.|$|E

2500|$|Cattle {{are very}} gregarious and even {{short-term}} isolation {{is considered to}} cause severe psychological stress.

The comic strip's popular success is attributable to its workplace setting and themes, which <b>are</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> a large and appreciative audience; Adams has said that switching the setting from Dilbert's home to his office was [...] "when the strip really started to take off". [...] The workplace location is Silicon Valley.|$|E
