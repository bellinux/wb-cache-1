40|$|We studied biopsies {{from the}} <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons</b> of {{patients}} undergoing open repair for a subcutaneous rupture of their <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons</b> (27 men, 11 women; mean age, 45. 3 +/- 13. 8 years) and specimens of <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons</b> from persons with no known tendon ailments (43 men, 3 women; mean age, 64. 2 +/- 9. 7 years). Histologic examination was performed using stained slides that were interpreted using a semiquantitative grading scale assessing fiber structure and arrangement, rounding of the nuclei, regional variations in cellularity, increased vascularity, decreased collagen stainability, hyalinization, and glycosaminoglycan. We gave {{up to three}} marks {{for each of these}} variables, with 0 being normal and 3 being maximally abnormal. All the histology slides were assessed twice in a blinded manner; the agreement between two readings ranged from 0. 56 to 0. 87 (kappa statistics). The score of ruptured tendons was significantly greater than the average score of control tendons (20. 5 +/- 3. 6 versus 6. 5 +/- 2. 1), and there was significantly higher degeneration in the ruptured <b>tendons.</b> Nonruptured <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons,</b> even at an advanced age, and ruptured <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons</b> are clearly part of two distinct populations.

40|$|Emery-Dreifuss muscular {{dystrophy}} (EDMD) {{can be seen}} in the middle childhood and the genetic patterns of them are X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant or recessive. The classic triad of this disease are: 1 -early contractures, particularly of the elbows, <b>achilles</b> <b>tendons,</b> and posterior cervical muscles; 2 -cardiac conduction defects;and 3 - a slowly progressive weakness and atrophy in a humeroperoneal distribution. The early onset of contractures before the onset of any significant weakness is unique to this disease. This case study was done in two 12 and 3. 5 years old brothers and their 8 years old sister in a family. The first one referred to the medical center because of his weakness muscles of shoulders and arms. The second case was referred with tip toe walking which has been started 8 months ago. The third case was referred with difficulties in walking and sitting and surgery on <b>achilles</b> <b>tendons</b> for her and the first case was performed at 4 and 8 years ago respectively. In physical examination contractures of <b>achilles</b> <b>tendons,</b> weakness of pelvic girdle muscles, positive gowers sign and tip toe walking were observed in all three cases. Echocardiogram in both boys and CK enzyme in all 3 patients were normal. In ECGs atrial flutter with 3 : 1 AV block was seen in all 3 individuals. Muscle biopsy was nonspecific in the first case and mild focal atrophy was seen in the second case. Findings of myopathic patterns in electromyography were seen in all 3 patients.

5|$|Durant {{was forced}} out of the 2015 season due to injury when he {{suffered}} a ruptured <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> in the Riders' first week game against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. After rehabbing his <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendon</b> all off-season Durant returned as the Roughriders leading quarterback for the 2016 season. Early {{in the second quarter of}} the fourth week Durant left the game after BC defensive linemen Mic’hael Brooks fell into his leg on a passing play. He was taken into the Riders locker room and later appeared on the sidelines using crutches. Following the game the X-Rays revealed no structural damage, and Durant was considered day-to-day with an ankle sprain. Durant ending up only missing two weeks returning as the starting quarterback in Week 7. Durant was also rested for the final game of the season as the team was eliminated from playoff competition and wanted to see their other quarterbacks on roster (Brandon Bridge, Mitchell Gale, and G.J. Kinne) get some playing time. Following the conclusion of the regular season Durant expressed his disappointment that contract negotiations with the Roughriders had stalled. If no deal had been reached, Durant would have been a free-agent when the free agency period commenced on 14 February 2017. On January 5, 2017 the Riders made a new offer to Durant. The offer reportedly included a base salary of around $300,000, with performance incentives set to reach $400,000 in 2017.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{radiofrequency}} ablation for thermomodulation of connective tissues {{has gained}} acceptance with some surgeons. It is now mainly used for shoulder instability, and two techniques are commonly applied – ablation {{in a uniform}} pattern (paintbrush) and ablation in a linearly dispersed fashion (grid). The use of these techniques for shrinkage of tendons or cruciate ligaments is not widely accepted but may be utilized in selected cases. We assessed the effects of thermomodulation via monopolar radiofrequency ablation using these two techniques on the histological and biomechanical properties of rabbit <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons.</b> 16 paired rabbit <b>achilles</b> <b>tendons</b> {{were divided into two}} treatment groups.

40|$|NSAIDs {{are widely}} {{prescribed}} and used {{over the years}} to treat tendon injuries despite its well-known long-term side effects. In the last years several animal and human trials have shown that low-level laser therapy (LLLT) presents modulatory effects on inflammatory markers, however the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the short-term effects of LLLT or sodium diclofenac treatments on biochemical markers and biomechanical properties of inflamed <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons.</b> Wistar rats <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons</b> (n?=? 6 /group) were injected with saline (control) or collagenase at peritendinous area of <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons.</b> After 1 ?h animals were treated with two different doses of LLLT (810 ?nm, 1 and 3 ?J) at the sites of the injections, or with intramuscular sodium diclofenac. Regarding biochemical analyses, LLLT significantly decreased (p?<? 0. 05) COX- 2, TNF-a, MMP- 3, MMP- 9, and MMP- 13 gene expression, as well as prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) production when compared to collagenase group. Interestingly, diclofenac treatment only decreased PGE 2 levels. Biomechanical properties were preserved in the laser-treated groups when compared to collagenase and diclofenac groups. We conclude that LLLT was able to reduce tendon inflammation and to preserve tendon resistance and elasticity. (c) 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Background: Chronic Achilles tendinosis is {{a common}} {{musculoskeletal}} disorder often refractory to conservative man-agement. Our study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy {{of the use of}} autologous skin-derived collagen-producing cells in the treatment of refractory Achilles tendinosis. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind study on forty <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons</b> in thirty-two patients (eight with bilateral involvement) who had a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of Achilles tendinosis. The patients ranged from twenty-two to sixty-seven years old and had amean age of 45. 2 years. The patients with unilateral involvement were randomized into the treatment group (twelve patients) and control group (twelve patients). The eight patients with bilateral involvement were individually randomized into treatment and control groups, with eight <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons</b> in each group. <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons</b> in the treatment group were injected under ultrasound guidance with laboratory-expanded, skin-derived fibroblasts suspended in autologous plasma. The control group received ultrasound-guided injection of a local anesthetic and physiotherapy. The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment (VISA) questionnaire and visual analog scale (VAS) scores were used as the main outcome measures for both groups. Results: Significant differences in the mean VISA and VAS scores were detected between the treatment and the control groups for the patients with unilateral involvement at six months (p < 0. 001 for both). With use of the Mann-Whitney U Test, significant differences in the VISA score were observed at the second visit and at the three-month and six-month visits (p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{report the}} ability of amino- and carboxyl-modified MCM- 41 {{mesoporous}} silica nanoparticles (MSN) to deliver gene in vivo in rat <b>Achilles</b> <b>tendons,</b> despite their inefficiency to transfect primary tenocytes in culture.
