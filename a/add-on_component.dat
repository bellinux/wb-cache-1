The Self-Assessment Tutor (SAT) is an <b>add-on</b> <b>component</b> to Cognitive Tutors that {{supports}} self-assessment in four steps: prediction, attempt, reflection, and projection.

The SAT offers detailed feedback and help function to support the Self-Assessment process. A complementary instruction is given to students before working with the SAT. We hypothesize that working with the SAT will encourage students to self-assess on subsequent problems requiring similar skills, and thus will promote learning.

40|$|Youth {{drug use}} is a severe problem worldwide. This review focuses on Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) as a {{treatment}} for young people who misuse non-opioid drugs, such as cannabis, amphetamines, ecstasy and cocaine, which are strongly associated with a range of health and social problems. CBT is an individualized and multicomponent intervention that combines behavioural and cognitive therapy. While behavioural therapy mainly focuses on external settings and observable behaviour, cognitive therapy is concerned with internal cognitive processes. The primary focus of CBT is to reduce users’ positive expectations about drug use, to enhance their self-confidence to resist drugs, and to improve their skills for problem-solving and for coping with daily life stressors. The objective of this review is to assess the effectiveness of CBT for young people (aged 13 - 21) in outpatient treatment for non-opioid drug use and to explore any factors that may moderate outcomes. The literature search yielded a total of 18, 514 references, of which 394 were deemed potentially relevant and retrieved for eligibility determination. Of these, 360 did not fulfil the screening criteria and were excluded. Four records were unobtainable. A total of seven unique studies, reported in 17 papers, were included in the review. Meta-analysis was used {{to examine the effects of}} CBT on drug use reduction, social and family functioning, school problems, treatment retention and criminal activity compared to a group of other interventions (Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (ACRA), Chestnut Bloomington Outpatient (CBOP) (+Assertive Continuing Care (ACC)), Drugs Harm Psychoeducation curriculum (DHPE), Functional Family Therapy (FFT), Interactional Therapy (IT), Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT), and Psychoeducational Therapy (PET)). Our main objective was to evaluate the current evidence on the effect of CBT on abstinence and drug use reduction for young people in outpatient treatment for non-opioid drug use. Seven randomised trials, involving 953 participants, were included in this review. Each of the seven included studies compared CBT to another intervention. We analysed the effects in the short term (from the start of treatment to up to 6 months thereafter), medium term (from 6 months to less than 12 months after the start of treatment), and long term (12 months or more after the start of treatment). We analysed CBT that was delivered with an <b>add-on</b> <b>component</b> such as motivational interviewing (four studies) separately from CBT that was delivered without an <b>add-on</b> <b>component</b> (three studies). Based on meta-analysis of data from the four included studies analysing CBT with an <b>add-on</b> <b>component,</b> there was no evidence of a relative effect of CBT for the reduction of youth drug use frequency compared to other interventions (ACRA, CBOP (+ACC), DHPE, FFT and MDFT).
