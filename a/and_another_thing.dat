The book was published by Penguin Books in the UK and Hyperion in the US in October 2009.|$|E
25|$|A forest f {{consists}} of a list of trees, while a tree t {{consists of}} a pair of a value v and a forest f (its children). This definition is elegant and easy to work with abstractly (such as when proving theorems about properties of trees), as it expresses a tree in simple terms: a list of one type, and a pair of two types. Further, it matches many algorithms on trees, which consist of doing one thing with the value, <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> with the children.|$|E
25|$|BBC Radio 4 also {{commissioned}} a third Dirk Gently radio series {{based on the}} incomplete chapters of The Salmon of Doubt, and written by Kim Fuller; but this was dropped in favour of a BBC TV series based on the two completed novels. A sixth Hitchhiker novel, <b>And</b> <b>Another</b> <b>Thing...,</b> by Artemis Fowl author Eoin Colfer, was released on 12 October 2009 (the 30th anniversary of the first book), published {{with the support of}} Adams's estate. A BBC Radio 4 Book at Bedtime adaptation and an audio book soon followed.|$|E

500|$|The {{fragrance}} called [...] "L" [...] {{was launched}} in September, 2007 at Soho House in New York City. Stefani worked with perfumer Harry Fremont to develop the scent. Stefani described the fragrance as [...] "it's another thing you can wear <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> I {{can be part of}} creatively. I created it for myself -- it's like me shrunk into a box." [...] The perfume is a blend of the aromas of hyacinth, white freesia, fresh pear, violet, jasmine, rose, lily, sweet pea, orange blossom, peach, frangipani, heliotrope and musk. The perfume was available in 50ml and 100ml bottles.|$|E
500|$|Raleigh {{was brought}} to trial on 17 November 1603, on charges of [...] "conspiring to deprive the King of his Government; to alter religion; {{to bring in the}} Roman superstition; and to procure foreign enemies to invade the kingdom". The {{government}} alleged that on 11 June 1603, Raleigh had met with Lord Cobham, and they had agreed to bring Lady Arbella Stuart (a great great granddaughter of Henry VII) to the English throne, and to accept 600,000marks from the Spanish government. As such, Raleigh was charged with supporting Stuart's claim to the throne and claiming Spanish money. He pleaded not guilty, with Coke's only evidence being a confession from Cobham, who was described as [...] "a weak and unprincipled creature... who said one thing at one time, <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> in another, and could be relied upon in nothing". This case was [...] "no case at all... It supports the general charges in the indictment only by the vaguest possible reference to 'these practices,' and 'plots and invasions' of which no more is said".|$|E

2500|$|There {{is indeed}} a law, right reason, which is in {{accordance}} with nature existing in all, unchangeable, eternal. Commanding us {{to do what is}} right, forbidding us to do what is wrong. It has dominion over good men, but possesses no influence over bad ones. No other law can be substituted for it, no part of it can be taken away, nor can it be abrogated altogether. Neither the people or the senate can absolve from it. It is not I one thing at Rome, <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> at Athens : one thing to-day, <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> to-morrow but it is eternal and immutable for all nations and for all time.|$|E
2500|$|Gouldman {{included}} {{a new version}} of [...] "Ready to Go Home" [...] on his 2000 solo album, <b>And</b> <b>Another</b> <b>Thing....</b> On the liner notes of his solo album, he noted: [...] "It reflects my feelings at the time. I suppose I was trying to put a positive slant on his passing, remembering all the things we had done together and his artistic legacy to me. The last verse of the song best reflects my feelings on this. This song has been recorded by many artists and remains one of my favourites. Very emotional." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "A Visit at Loma Linda. Dear Readers, You have {{no doubt}} read of Loma Linda in some of our papers, but I do not know of any thing ever {{appearing}} in the MESSENGER concerning it. I might say, {{it is one thing}} to read about it, <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> to visit it, and to see for yourself. For three weeks it was my privilege to visit there. Loma Linda is certainly in keeping with what its name implies--Hill Beautiful. It is located in an ideal spot, and, in my opinion, is as pretty as pictured. To receive a training there must be deemed a privilege. The advantages and opportunities are excellent, and come up to one's expectations.|$|E
2500|$|Yet Berg also noted, [...] "As late as April 1939after Germany overtook CzechoslovakiaLindbergh {{was willing}} to make excuses for Hitler. 'Much as I {{disapprove}} of many things Hitler had done,' {{he wrote in his}} diary on , 1939, 'I believe she [...] has pursued the only consistent policy in Europe in recent years. I cannot support her broken promises, but she has only moved a little faster than other nations... in breaking promises. The question of right and wrong is one thing by law <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> by history.'" [...] Berg also explained that leading up to the war, in Lindbergh's mind, the great battle would be between the Soviet Union and Germany, not fascism and democracy.|$|E
2500|$|Flavius Josephus in Jewish Antiquities , chapter 2 {{recorded}} {{the story of}} King Izates of Adiabene who decided to follow the Law of Moses at {{the advice of a}} Jewish merchant named Ananias. He was going to get circumcised, but his mother, Helen, who herself embraced the Jewish customs, advised against it {{on the grounds that the}} subjects would not stand to be ruled by someone who followed such [...] "strange and foreign rites". Ananias likewise advised against it, on the grounds that worship of God was superior to circumcision (Robert Eisenman in James the Brother of Jesus claims that Ananias is Paul of Tarsus who held similar views) and that God would forgive him for fear of his subjects. So Izates decided against it. However, later, [...] "a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar", who was well versed in the Law, convinced him that he should, on the grounds that it was one thing to read the Law <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> to practice it, and so he did. Once Helen and Ananias found out, they were struck by great fear of the possible consequences, but as Josephus put it, God looked after Izates. As his reign was peaceful and blessed, Helen visited the Jerusalem Temple to thank God, and since there was a terrible famine at the time, she brought lots of food and aid to the people of Jerusalem.|$|E

It seems there's still an answer when you send round the Fiery Cross." ...|$|R
2500|$|Phrases such as [...] "It is vain to do {{with more}} {{what can be done}} with fewer" [...] and [...] "A {{plurality}} is not to be posited without necessity" [...] were commonplace in 13th-century scholastic writing. Robert Grosseteste, in Commentary on [...] the Posterior Analytics Books (Commentarius in Posteriorum Analyticorum Libros) (c. 1217–1220), declares: [...] "That is better and more valuable which requires fewer, other circumstances being equal... For if one thing were demonstrated from many <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> from fewer equally known premises, clearly that is better which is from fewer because it makes us know quickly, just as a universal demonstration is better than particular because it produces knowledge from fewer premises. Similarly in natural science, in moral science, and in metaphysics the best is that which needs no premises and the better that which needs the fewer, other circumstances being equal." [...] The Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) states that [...] "it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many". Aquinas uses this principle to construct an objection to God's existence, an objection that he in turn answers and refutes generally (cf. quinque viae), and specifically, through an argument based on causality. Hence, Aquinas acknowledges the principle that today is known as Occam's razor, but prefers causal explanations to other simple explanations (cf. also Correlation does not imply causation).|$|E
