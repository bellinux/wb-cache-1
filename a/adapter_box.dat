50|$|The {{friction}} pile driving process starts by laying the grout shoe {{at the proper}} location and inserting the spigot end of the pile shaft into the conical point. The pile is kept in place {{by a series of}} keeper plates within the conical grout shoe. As the pile is driven the conical grout shoe creates an annulus between the pile shaft and the surrounding soils. This annulus is immediately and consistently filled with a sand grout that is pumped down the pile shaft and exits within spaced between the keeper fins in the conical points. The breaker hammer driving tool is fitted with a special grout <b>box</b> <b>adapter</b> to allow the grout to flow from the grout pump through the driving tool down into the upper most pile shaft. The pumping rate of the grout should slightly exceed the take rate of the grout. In softer soils the grout takes tend to be higher due to outward bulging of the grout column.|$|R

5000|$|McSavaney's {{preferred}} {{equipment was}} a lightweight wood field camera {{with a variety}} of lenses. He preferred a wide-angle lens — his preference was a 90 mm — because, as he said, it enabled him to get close to his subject. As they progressively became available, he used wide-angle lens up to the then latest 47 mm, enabling him to get even closer. Even at the risk of running out of loaded film holders, he usually made at least two exposures. Parenthetically, the necessity of carrying bulky film holders (anachronisms in the digital age) was considerably eased when Kodak's Readyload packets became available. McSavaney's spare negative was insurance against defects and allowed him to experiment with altering its tonalities in the darkroom as necessary for printing. Occasionally he made a Polaroid print on the spot to decide on the best exposure for critical scenes. In the pre-digital age, it was a rare serious photographer who ventured into the wilds of the Southwest without a trusty Polaroid 4x5 film-pack <b>adapter</b> and several <b>boxes</b> of film. (Must read: Ansel’s relationship with Edwin Land and Polaroid in [...] ). Many well-exposed polaroids are in McSavaney's archives. He was a very careful photographer, sparing no effort, always with the final print in mind. He practiced Adams’ dictum, that analogous to orchestral music, the negative is merely the score whereas the print is the concert performance. Somewhat in the same vein, Oliver Gagliani, a good friend of Ansel, had a slightly different take by equating music to the language of the soul, photography to the language of the spirit. Bruce Barnbaum passionately equates his landscape photographs to his music. Few photographers stray far from Adams' analogy, or far from the sound of music.|$|R
40|$|The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III - International Space Station (ISS) {{instrument}} {{will be used}} to study ozone, providing global, long-term measurements of key components of the Earth's atmosphere for the continued health of Earth and its inhabitants. SAGE III is launched into orbit in an inverted configuration on SpaceX;s Falcon 9 launch vehicle. As one of its four supporting elements, a Contamination Monitoring Package (CMP) mounted to the top panel of the Interface <b>Adapter</b> Module (IAM) <b>box</b> experiences high-frequency response due to structural coupling between the two structures during the SpaceX launch. These vibrations, which were initially observed in the IAM Engineering Development Unit (EDU) test and later verified through finite element analysis (FEA) for the SpaceX launch loads, may damage the internal electronic cards and the Thermoelectric Quartz Crystal Microbalance (TQCM) sensors mounted on the CMP. Three-dimensional (3 D) vibration isolators were required to be inserted between the CMP and IAM interface in order to attenuate the high frequency vibrations without resulting in any major changes to the existing system. Wire rope isolators were proposed as the isolation system between the CMP and IAM due to the low impact to design. Most 3 D isolation systems are designed for compression and roll, therefore little dynamic data was available for using wire rope isolators in an inverted or tension configuration. From the isolator FEA and test results, it is shown that by using the 3 D wire rope isolators, the CMP high-frequency responses have been suppressed by several orders of magnitude over a wide excitation frequency range. Consequently, the TQCM sensor responses are well below their qualification environments. It is indicated that these high-frequency responses due to the typical instrument structural coupling can be significantly suppressed by a vibration passive control using the 3 D vibration isolator. Thermal and contamination issues were also examined during the isolator selection period for meeting the SAGE III-ISS instrument requirements...|$|R
40|$|Resilient {{provision}} of Position Navigation and Timing (PNT) data {{is one of}} the key enablers of the e-Navigation strategy of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Currently Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are the primary source for the determination of absolute position, velocity and time (PVT) for merchant vessel navigation. On a ship bridge a number of systems like Electronic Chart and Information Systems (ECDIS), automatic track control systems and the Automatic Identification System (AIS) are relying on that PVT provision. Nevertheless it is well known that GNSS performance can strongly degrade due to space weather events, jamming and spoofing. Especially the availability and usage of low cost jammers, so called personal privacy devices (PPD) lead to the question on how the navigation equipment onboard a vessel would perform on the presence of a PPD jammer. In the past the General Lighthouse Authorities (GLA) had conducted jamming sea trials, focusing mainly on the question, how resilient PNT provision can be assured by using a backup radio navigation system like e-LORAN. However, the potential of novel GNSS receiver technologies, which are supposed to lead to higher resilience against jamming, as well as the opportunities of multi-sensor fusion for real-time {{provision of}} PNT data on board the vessel so far have not been systematically investigated and a careful evaluation is needed in order to evaluate their performance during real maritime jamming measurement campaign. In order to address the aforementioned issues the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in cooperation with the German Federal Network Agency has allocated a civil maritime GNSS jamming testbed in the Baltic Sea. The test area is located approximately 6 nm north of the Darß peninsula with the first jamming measurement campaign in the area conducted in November 2015. The goal of the first measurement campaign was to evaluate the impact of a commercial PPD jammer on the position accuracy and the availability of the position fix of standard GPS/GNSS receivers. For that measurement campaign a PPD Jammer was mounted on the monkey deck of the tugboat AARON (length 26 m, beam 8 m). During the campaign the AARON was anchoring in the center of the Jamming test area, keeping a fixed position and orientation (heading). Due to some waves (wave height: 1 - 2 m) the roll and pitch angle of the vessel was varying significantly. The applied PPD Jammer was sweeping a cw signal around the GPS L 1 frequency covering a bandwidth of 17 MHz. Therefore this device was affecting both GPS L 1 and Galileo E 1 signal tracking, but not GLONASS L 1. This enabled us the usage of GLONASS for the calculation of a highly precise PPP reference trajectory in post processing even in the direct vicinity of the Jammer. The measurement equipment was installed on the multipurpose research and diving vessel BALTIC TAUCHER II (length 29 m, beam 7 m), which was navigating around the tugboat AARON with a max. speed of 8 knots and a distance to the jammer varying from 50 m to 4000 m. The vessel was equipped with three separate dual frequency GNSS antennas and receivers (Javad Delta), FOG and MEMS IMUs, gyrocompass, Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) and echo sounder. All relevant sensor measurements were provided either directly via Ethernet or via serial to Ethernet <b>adapter</b> to a <b>Box</b> PC where the measurements were processed in real-time and in parallel stored in a SQlite 3 database along with corresponding time stamps. The described setup enables a record and replay functionality for further processing of the original sensor data. The system consists of a highly modular hardware platform and a Real-Time software Framework (RTF) implemented in ANSI-C++. Results: The GPS L 1 based single point positioning results using the pseudorange measurements of the three GNSS receivers/antennas show large differences in both accuracy and availability. As all the three receivers were completely identical with the same firmware versions and were identically configured, the only difference is in the mounting of three corresponding antennas to be distributed throughout the vessel. Therefore the mounting environment of the antenna seems to have a relatively large impact on the position performance in the presence of a jamming signal, especially, when the jammer is located in a comparable altitude like the antennas themselves. The largest horizontal position errors in the presence pf a jamming signal were found to be 250 m. In a second step the performance of a state-of-the-art Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) approach in the presence of a jamming signal was evaluated for all three antennas. While the availability of position results, which were declared as ‘safe’ by the RAIM algorithm, is obviously reduced, no large horizontal position errors (HPE) (> 10 m) were found. Moreover, the calculated horizontal protection level (HPL) was reported to be always larger than the actual HPE for the whole time period evaluated here. The preliminary results confirm that the navigator can mostly avoid getting an erroneous position fix without a warning by applying properly designed RAIM approaches. Further improvements both in accuracy and the availability of the solution are expected due to complementary behavior of spatially distributed antennas and corresponding extension of the RAIM-like methods. Finally, the performance of the corresponding integrated navigation solutions supported by inertial sensors and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) and corresponding extensions for multiple-antenna setup should be evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{power consumption}} and power density demands of modern technologies {{have increased the}} technical requirements of DC/DC and AC/DC power supplies. In this regard, the primary objective of the power supply researcher/engineer is to build energy efficient, high power density converters by reducing the losses and increasing the switching frequency of converters respectively. Operating the converter circuits at higher switching frequencies reduces {{the size of the}} passive components such as transformers, inductors, and capacitors, which results in a compact size, weight, and increased power density of the converter. Therefore, the thesis work is focussed on the design, analysis and evaluation of isolated converters operating in the 1 - 5 MHz frequency region {{with the assistance of the}} latest semi conductor devices, both coreless and core based planar power transformers designed in Mid Sweden University and which are suitable for consumer applications of varying power levels ranging from 1 – 60 W. In high frequency converter circuits, since the MOSFET gate driver plays a prominent role, different commercially available MOSFET gate drivers were evaluated in the frequency range of 1 - 5 MHz in terms of gate drive power consumption, rise/fall times and electromagnetic interference (EMI) and a suitable driver was proposed. Initially, the research was focused on the design and evaluation of a quasi resonant flyback converter using a multilayered coreless PCB step down transformer in the frequency range of 2. 7 – 4 MHz up to the power level of 10 W. The energy efficiency of this converter is found to be 72 - 84 % under zero voltage switching conditions (ZVS). In order to further improve the energy efficiency of the converter in the MHz frequency region, the new material device GaN HEMT was considered. The comparisons were made on a quasi resonant flyback DC-DC converter using both the Si and GaN technology and it was found that an energy efficiency improvement of 8 – 10 % was obtained with the GaN device in the frequency range of 3. 2 – 5 MHz. In order to minimize the gate drive power consumption, switching losses and to increase the frequency of the converter in some applications such as laptop <b>adapters,</b> set top <b>box</b> (STB) etc., a cascode flyback converter using a low voltage GaN HEMT and a high voltage Si MOSFET was designed and evaluated using a multi-layered coreless PCB transformer in the MHz frequency region. Both the simulation and experimental results have shown that, with the assistance of the cascode flyback converter, the switching speeds of the converter can be increased with the benefit of obtaining a significant improvement in the energy efficiency as compared to that for the single switch flyback converter. In order to further maximize the utilization of the transformer, to reduce the voltage stress on MOSFETs and to obtain the maximum power density from the converter circuit, double ended topologies were considered. Due to the lack of high voltage high side gate drivers in the MHz frequency region, a gate drive circuitry utilizing the multi-layered coreless PCB signal transformer was designed and evaluated in both a half-bridge and series resonant converter (SRC). It was found that the gate drive power consumption using this transformer was around 0. 66 W for the frequency range of 1. 5 - v 3. 75 MHz. In addition, by using this gate drive circuitry, the maximum energy efficiency of the SRC using multilayered coreless PCB power transformer was found to be 86. 5 % with an output power of 36. 5 W in the switching frequency range of 2 – 3 MHz. In order to further enhance the energy efficiency of the converter to more than 90 %, investigations were carried out by using the multiresonant converter topology (LCC and LLC), novel hybrid core high frequency planar power transformer and the GaN HEMTs. The simulated and experimental results of the designed LCC resonant converter show that it is feasible to obtain higher energy efficiency isolated DC/DC converters in the MHz frequency region. The peak energy efficiency of the LCC converter at 3. 5 MHz is reported to be 92 % using synchronous rectification. Different modulation techniques were implemented to regulate the converter for both line and load variations using a digital controller. In order to realize an AC/DC converter suitable for a laptop adapter application, consideration was given to the low line of the universal input voltage range due to the GaN switch limitation. The energy efficiency of the regulated converter operating in the frequency range of 2. 8 – 3. 5 MHz is reported to be more than 90 % with a load power of 45 W and an output voltage of 22 V dc. In order to determine an efficient power processing method on the secondary side of the converter, a comparison was made between diode rectification and synchronous rectification and optimal rectification was proposed for the converters operating in the MHz frequency range for a given power transfer application. In order to maintain high energy efficiency for a wide load range and to maintain the narrow switching frequency range for the given input voltage specifications, the LLC resonant converter has been designed and evaluated for the adapter application. From the observed results, the energy efficiency of the LLC resonant converter is maintained at a high level for a wide load range as compared to that for the LCC resonant converter. Investigations were also carried out on isolated class E resonant DC-DC converter with the assistance of GaN HEMT and a high performance planar power transformer at the switching frequency of 5 MHz. The simulated energy efficiency of the converter for the output power level of 16 W is obtained as 88. 5 % which makes it feasible to utilize the designed isolated converter for various applications that require light weight and low profile converters. In conclusion, the research in this dissertation has addressed various issues related to high frequency isolated converters and has proposed solution by designing highly energy efficient converters to meet the current industrial trends by using coreless and core based planar transformer technologies along with the assistance of GaN HEMTs. With the provided solution, in the near future, it is feasible to realize low profile, high power density DC/DC and AC/DC converters operating in MHz frequency region suitable for various applications.
