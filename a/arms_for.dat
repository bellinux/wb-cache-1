5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade <b>arms</b> <b>for</b> hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading <b>arms</b> <b>for</b> hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E
5|$|A 2007 study {{suggested}} that Massospondylus {{may have used}} its short <b>arms</b> <b>for</b> defense against predators ("defensive swats"), in intraspecies combat, or in feeding, although its arms were too short to reach its mouth. Scientists speculate that Massospondylus could have used its large pollex (thumb) claw in combat, to strip plant material from trees, digging, or for grooming.|$|E
5|$|All {{citizens}} of Canada, {{as well as}} corporate bodies, may petition the Crown for an award of <b>arms.</b> <b>For</b> an individual to obtain a grant of arms, a petition must {{be sent to the}} Chief Herald, providing a biography, references, and completed application forms. If the grant is approved, the individual then consults with heralds from the Authority to work out the design of their award. Upon completion of this process, the grant documents, in the form of letters patent, are created and provided to the grantee. The entire process is subject to certain fees required by the Government of Canada to cover costs of research and artwork; the fees are not to purchase the grant of <b>arms.</b> <b>For</b> corporations and institutions the process is similar.|$|E

5|$|State Arms of the Union, {{illustrated}} by Henry Mitchell {{and published by}} Louis Prang (known {{as the father of}} the lithographic industry), offers historically accurate renderings of the state's coats of arms as they existed in 1876. An accomplished engraver with the Bureau of Engraving and Printing for 40 years, Mitchell was responsible for engraving several coats of <b>arms</b> <b>for</b> official state use as well as <b>arms</b> <b>for</b> well-known educational and philanthropic organizations. The illustrations are presented alongside proof impressions from the engraved dies used to print the state arms on the first issue of United States National Bank Notes.|$|E

5|$|The Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland under James was symbolised heraldically by {{combining}} their arms, supporters and badges. Contention {{as to how}} the arms should be marshalled, and to which kingdom should take precedence, was solved by having different <b>arms</b> <b>for</b> each country.|$|E
5|$|Various {{morphological}} {{features of}} galaxies can affect {{their potential for}} habitability. Spiral <b>arms,</b> <b>for</b> example, are the location of star formation, but they contain numerous giant molecular clouds and a high density of stars that can perturb a star's Oort cloud, sending avalanches of comets and asteroids toward any planets further in. In addition, the high density of stars and rate of massive star formation can expose any stars orbiting within the spiral <b>arms</b> <b>for</b> too long to supernova explosions, reducing their prospects for the survival and development of life. Considering these factors, the Sun is advantageously placed within the galaxy because, {{in addition to being}} outside a spiral arm, it orbits near the corotation radius, maximizing the interval between spiral-arm crossings.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} centuries, rolls of arms {{included}} invented <b>arms</b> <b>for</b> kings of foreign lands (Neubecker, 30). Around 1310, Jacques de Longuyon wrote the Voeux de Paon ("Vows of the Peacock"), {{which included a}} list of nine famous leaders. This list, divided into three groups of three, became known in art and literature as the Nine Worthies (Loomis 1938, 37). Each of the Nine Worthies were given a coat of arms. King David, for instance, was assigned a gold harp as a device (Neubecker, 172).|$|E

5|$|In April, the Bosnian Serbs {{were able}} to deploy 200,000 troops, {{hundreds}} of tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and artillery pieces. The Bosnian Croats could field approximately 25,000 soldiers {{and a handful of}} heavy weapons, while the Bosniaks were largely unprepared for combat with nearly 100,000 troops, but small <b>arms</b> <b>for</b> less than half of their number and virtually no heavy weapons.|$|E

A design made by Hernán Martínez Morales from Curicó was eventually adopted by the local government on 19 December 1986, under the administration of Mayor René Maturana Maldonado.|$|E

5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{broke out}} in the spring or summer of 1277 in north-eastern Bulgaria where the Mongol devastation was strongest. In the summer of 1277 Ivaylo confronted and defeated a plundering Mongol unit. Another victory followed soon and by autumn all Mongols were driven out of Bulgarian territory. Having achieved what had eluded the Bulgarian <b>arms</b> <b>for</b> decades, his popularity and reputation rose quickly. Among his followers were an increasing number of nobles who were discontent with the intrigues of Empress Maria. Ivaylo was hailed as Emperor by the people and many regions came under his control.|$|E

5|$|Efforts {{had begun}} {{as early as}} 1911 to procure arms and smuggle them into India. When {{a clear idea of}} the {{conspiracy}} emerged, more earnest and elaborate plans were made to obtain arms and to enlist international support. Herambalal Gupta, who had arrived in the United States in 1914 at the Berlin Committee's directives, took over the leadership of American wing of the conspiracy after the failure of the SS Korea mission. Gupta immediately began efforts to obtain men and arms. While men were in plentiful supply with more and more Indians coming forward to join the Ghadarite cause, obtaining <b>arms</b> <b>for</b> the uprising proved to be more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel García Moreno, upon {{assuming}} power {{two days}} after the Battle of Guayaquil in September 1860, the yellow, blue and red triband was returned to use; its reinstatement on September 26 is commemorated during Ecuador's national flag day. Previously, a vertical white, blue and white flag was used. In the middle of the blue stripe, there were white stars placed to signify the number of provinces in Ecuador. The highest star total was seven before this flag was abandoned. In 1900, the flag was made the definitive national standard, and was charged with the coat of <b>arms</b> <b>for</b> official national government use while the plain flag was reserved for the merchant marine.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 Mitchell {{joined the}} Bureau of Engraving and Printing and for 40 years {{engraved}} stamped envelopes. Through his BEP work, Mitchell was {{also responsible for}} engraving the seal of the Secretary of the Navy and the Internal Revenue Service.

Outside {{of state and federal}} government engraving, Mitchell engraved the seals and coats of <b>arms</b> <b>for</b> many well-known institutions which include Harvard University, Society of the Cincinnati, and Boston Public Library. He engraved the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition award medal (1876) which was struck in the Philadelphia Mint. In 1891, Mitchell was invited by the Secretary of the Treasury to join a committee to evaluate the artistic design proposals for a new issue of U.S. coins. The two other members were Charles E. Barber, Chief Engraver of the United States Mint, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.|$|E
