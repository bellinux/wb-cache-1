25|$|A {{diagnosis}} of TTP {{is based on}} the clinical symptoms with the concomitant presence of thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 100×109/L) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes on the blood smear, a negative direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test</b> (coombs test), elevated levels of hemolysis markers (such as total bilirubin, LDH, free hemoglobin and an unmeasurable haptoglobin), after exclusion of any other apparent cause.|$|E
25|$|Blood {{tests in}} PNH show changes {{consistent}} with intravascular hemolytic anemia: low hemoglobin, raised lactate dehydrogenase, raised bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin), and decreased levels of haptoglobin; {{there can be}} raised reticulocytes (immature red cells released by the bone marrow to replace the destroyed cells) {{if there is no}} iron deficiency present. The direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test</b> (DAT, or direct Coombs' test) is negative, as the hemolysis of PNH is not caused by antibodies. If the PNH occurs in the setting of known (or suspected) aplastic anemia, abnormal white blood cell counts and decreased platelet counts may be seen at this. In this case, anemia may be caused by insufficient red blood cell production in addition to the hemolysis.|$|E
25|$|A {{positive}} screen warrants an antibody panel/investigation {{to determine}} if it is clinically significant. An antibody panel consists of commercially prepared group O red cell suspensions from donors that have been phenotyped for antigens that correspond to commonly encountered and clinically significant alloantibodies. Donor cells may have homozygous (e.g. K+k−), heterozygous (K+k+) expression or no expression of various antigens (K−k−). The phenotypes of all the donor cells being tested are shown in a chart. The patient's serum is tested against the various donor cells. Based on the reactions of the patient's serum against the donor cells, a pattern will emerge to confirm the presence {{of one or more}} antibodies. Not all antibodies are clinically significant (i.e. cause transfusion reactions, HDN, etc.). Once the patient has developed a clinically significant antibody it is vital that the patient receive antigen-negative red blood cells to prevent future transfusion reactions. A direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test</b> (Coombs test) is also performed as part of the antibody investigation.|$|E
40|$|Objective: We here {{report the}} first study on the {{distribution}} of red cell antigens and phenotype frequencies of various blood group systems in Maldives.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{antibody}} response of cattle to the antigen of Yersinia enterocolitica IX cross-reacting with Brucella spp. was examined. Density-gradient ultracentrifugation, ion-exchange chromatography, antibody adsorption and elution and disulphide bond reduction tests showed that both 19 S IgM and 7 S IgG 1 and IgG 2 antibodies were produced {{in response to the}} cross-reacting antigen. The highest titres of cross-reacting antibodies were detected by the agglutination and Coombs <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>tests.</b> Production of complement-fixing and precipitating antibodies cross-reacting with Br. abortus was transient and high titres were not attained...|$|R
2500|$|Acute {{hemolytic}} {{reactions are}} defined according to Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) as [...] "fever and other symptoms/signs of haemolysis within 24 hours of transfusion; confirmed {{by one or}} more of the following: a fall of Hb, rise in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), positive direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test</b> (DAT), positive crossmatch" [...] This is due to destruction of donor red blood cells by preformed recipient antibodies. Most often this occurs due to clerical errors or improper ABO blood typing and crossmatching resulting in a mismatch in ABO blood type between the donor and the recipient. Symptoms include fever, chills, chest pain, back pain, hemorrhage, increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and rapid drop in blood pressure. When suspected, transfusion should be stopped immediately, and blood sent for tests to evaluate for presence of hemolysis. Treatment is supportive. Kidney injury may occur due to the effects of the hemolytic reaction (pigment nephropathy). The severity of the transfusion reaction is depended upon amount of donor's antigen transfused, nature of the donor's antigens, the nature and the amount of recipient antibodies.|$|E
5000|$|A Coombs test (also {{known as}} Coombs' test, <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test</b> or AGT) is either of two {{clinical}} blood tests used in immunohematology and immunology.

40|$|The {{serological}} {{relationship between}} Brucella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica IX, {{and the group}} N salmonella serotypes S. godesberg, S. landau, S. morehead, S. neusdorf, S. soerenga and S. urbana was examined using agglutination, antiglobulin, complement fixation, immunodiffusion and fluorescent antibody methods. Antisera to the group N salmonella serotypes all reacted to significant titres in agglutination and complement fixation, but not <b>antiglobulin</b> or immunodiffusion <b>tests</b> with smooth brucella antigens. These antisera also reacted in agglutination, but not <b>antiglobulin,</b> <b>tests</b> with Y. enterocolitica IX. They did not react significantly in any tests with rough brucella antigens. Conversely, antisera to smooth Brucella spp. agglutinated group N salmonellas to low titre and Y. enterocolitica IX to titres similar to those given against the homologous strain. Antiserum to Y. enterocolitica IX {{on the other hand}} reacted with smooth brucella antigens to high titre in agglutination, complement fixation and <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>tests,</b> and with the group N salmonella antigens to substantial titres in agglutination tests. In direct fluorescent antibody tests, smooth Brucella strains and Y. enterocolitica IX reacted strongly with FITC-labelled antibody to Br. abortus whereas the group N salmonella strains reacted weakly. In tests with monospecific antisera to the A and M determinants of Br. abortus and Br. melitensis respectively, Y. enterocolitica IX reacted only with the antiserum to the A determinant whereas group N salmonellas reacted to low titre with both A and M antisera. The results of cross-absorption tests confirmed this relationship and suggested that the O 30 antigens of group N salmonella serotypes contained antigenic determinants similar to, but not identical with, the antigenic structure shared by smooth Brucella spp. and Y. enterocolitica IX...|$|R
40|$|Hemolysis is an {{uncommon}} and usually late complication of malignancy, and very rarely the presenting feature. Cancer-associated hemolysis may be immune-mediated, or {{may result from}} thrombotic microangiopathy accompanied by thrombocytopenia. We describe an unusual case of isolated hemolysis {{in the setting of}} occult metastatic breast cancer. The patient initially presented with symptomatic anemia, with evidence of hemolysis but with negative direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>testing</b> and a normal platelet count. Subsequent investigation discovered metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast involving bone marrow. Hemolysis worsened despite initial treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and a trial of corticosteroids, but later resolved with aromatase inhibitor therapy...|$|R
40|$|Second- and third-generation cephalosporins, notably cefotetan, are {{increasingly}} implicated in severe, sometimes fatal immunemediated hemolytic anemia. We describe a 26 -year-old woman who developed severe hemolytic anemia 2 weeks {{after receiving a}} single prophylactic dose of cefotetan during cesarean delivery. The patient's DAT was weakly reactive for IgG and her serum reacted with cefotetan-coated RBCs. The antibody had a titer of 4, 096 by <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>testing.</b> The patient required treatment with two units of PRBCs and experienced gradual resolution of hemolysis. Our case emphasizes the need for increased awareness of delayed onset hemolytic anemia following prophylactic use of cefotetan...|$|R
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} is made upon blood tests to confirm not only hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura, {{but also a}} positive direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test</b> (DAT) and an absence of any known underlying cause.|$|E
50|$|The direct Coombs test (also {{known as}} the direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test</b> or DAT) is used to detect if {{antibodies}} or complement system factors have bound to RBCs surface antigens in vivo. The DAT is not currently required for pre-transfusion testing but may be included by some laboratories.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the past}} three decades, studies {{defining}} red-cell blood groups and serum antibodies have produced diagnostic methods that have laid the basis for immunologic concepts relevant {{to many of the}} acquired hemolytic states. Of these developments, the <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test</b> described by Coombs, Mourant, and Race in 1945 has proved {{to be one of the}} more important, useful tools now available for the detection of immune hemolytic states. This technique demonstrated that a rabbit antibody against human globulin would induce agglutination of human red cells [...] "coated with an incomplete variety of rhesus antibody". C. Moreschlit had used the same method in 1908 in a goat antirabbit-red-cell system. The test was premature and was forgotten. In 1946, Boorman, Dodd, and Loutit applied the direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test</b> to a variety of hemolytic anemias, and laid the foundation for the clear distinction of autoimmune from congenital hemolytic anemia.|$|E
40|$|Healthy adults (parents, neighbours, and {{hospital}} staff) {{in close contact}} with children with leukaemia were found to have a high incidence of positive latex agglutination <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>tests</b> (probably an IgM antiglobulin antibody). This may explain a previous report of a high incidence of IgM anti-EB virus antibodies in parents of leukaemic children, which our results did not confirm (IgM antiglobulin, reacting with IgG anti-EB virus, could have been misinterpreted as IgM anti-EB virus). The antiglobulin antibody probably represents a nonspecific response to an infective agent. Other hospital staff, including those exposed to nonleukaemic children with infections, had a much lower incidence of the antibody, and it may represent a response to the leukaemic process itself, rather than to the infections to which such children are prone. Some leukaemic children have a similar antibody...|$|R

Transient weak positive <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>tests</b> and traces of albuminuria occurred in both inoculated and control mice. Histological examination at 12 – 24 months of age showed moderate to severe damage in the kidneys of occasional control and inoculated C 57 BL and HI mice, and mild damage in occasional control and inoculated BALB/c and CBA recipients.

50|$|A {{diagnosis}} of TTP {{is based on}} the clinical symptoms with the concomitant presence of thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 100×109/L) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes on the blood smear, a negative direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test</b> (coombs test), elevated levels of hemolysis markers (such as total bilirubin, LDH, free hemoglobin and an unmeasurable haptoglobin), after exclusion of any other apparent cause.|$|E
50|$|Rho(D) immune {{globulin}} {{is composed}} of IgG antibodies and therefore is able to cross the placenta. In rare cases this can cause a baby to have a weakly positive DAT (direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test)</b> due to sensitization of fetal cells from mothers who have received multiple doses of Rho(D) immune globulin. However, no treatment is necessary as the clinical course is benign.|$|E
5000|$|AIHA {{cannot be}} {{attributed}} to any single autoantibody. To determine the autoantibody or autoantibodies present in a patient, the Coombs test, {{also known as the}} <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test,</b> is performed. There are two types of Coombs tests, direct and indirect; more commonly, the direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test</b> (DAT) is used. Classification of the antibodies is based on their activity at different temperatures and their etiology. Antibodies with high activity at physiological temperature (approximately 37 °C) are termed warm autoantibodies. Cold autoantibodies act best at temperatures of 0-4 °C. Patients with cold-type AIHA, therefore, have higher disease activity when body temperature falls into a hypothermic state. Usually, the antibody becomes active when it reaches the limbs, at which point it opsonizes RBCs. When these RBCs return to central regions, they are damaged by complement. Patients may present with one or both types of autoantibodies; if both are present, the disease is termed [...] "mixed-type" [...] AIHA.|$|E

40|$|Enzyme linked and radioimmune direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>tests</b> (DAGTs) {{were used}} to assess red cell bound IgG, IgA, and IgM in 585 {{patients}} referred to an immunohaematology reference centre. One hundred and fifty eight patients with {{less than or equal to}} 200 mol IgG and small amounts of IgA and IgM coating their red cells were studied in detail. The presence of autoimmune haemolysis was determined from the clinical, haematological, and biochemical findings; it occurred in at least 25 % of the 158 patients, the degree varying widely. There was a highly significant association between small increases in cell bound immunoglobulins and the presence of autoimmune haemolysis. Immunoglobulins of IgG, IgA, and IgM classes could produce autoimmune haemolysis when the classical agglutination DAGTs were negative; the IgA and IgM were usually found in association with IgG. The haemolytic effect was enhanced by the presence of complement and combinations of immunoglobulin classes on the red cells...|$|R
40|$|Immunohaematological {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out in 46 patients with erythrocyte autoantibodies associated with myelodysplastic syndromes. Eight patients had refractory anaemia, 17 refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts, 11 refractory anaemia with excess of blasts, four chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, five refractory anaemia with excess of blasts in transformation and one could not be classified. Standard agglutination direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>tests</b> showed that the red cells were most often coated with IgG and C 3 d, though increased amounts of IgM or IgA were also found in 15 of 35 cases (43 %) when the more sensitive enzyme linked method was used. The IgG antibodies were predominantly of IgG 1 subclass. Clinically important autoimmune haemolysis occurred in 15 patients, and was of "warm", "cold," and "mixed" types in seven, four, and four cases, respectively: {{it is important to}} recognise its presence in view of the good response to treatment. The increased incidence of erythrocyte autoantibodies in myelodysplastic syndromes is thought to be one manifestation of disturbed immune homeostasis...|$|R
50|$|The {{indirect}} Coombs test (also {{known as}} the indirect <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test</b> or IAT) is used to detect in-vitro antibody-antigen reactions. It is used to detect very low concentrations of antibodies present in a patient's plasma/serum prior to a blood transfusion. In antenatal care, the IAT is used to screen pregnant women for antibodies that may cause hemolytic disease of the newborn. The IAT {{can also be used}} for compatibility testing, antibody identification, RBC phenotyping, and titration studies.|$|E
50|$|Measuring {{the level}} of {{haptoglobin}} in a patient's blood is ordered whenever a patient exhibits symptoms of anemia, such as pallor, fatigue, or shortness of breath, along with physical signs of hemolysis, such as jaundice or dark-colored urine. The test is also commonly ordered as a hemolytic anemia battery, which also includes a reticulocyte count and a peripheral blood smear. It can also be ordered along with a direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test</b> when a patient is suspected of having a transfusion reaction or symptoms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Also, it may be ordered {{in conjunction with a}} bilirubin.|$|E

40|$|Cyclic {{neutropenia}} (CN) is {{an inherited}} disorder characterized by regularly recurring episodes of neutropenia in humans and Gray Collie dogs. Early thymic hypotrophy and lymphoid exhaustion in the CN dogs suggests {{there may be}} a lymphoid cell differentiation defect. Later manifestations of CN in dogs include arthritis, anaemia, glomerulone-phritis, and amyloidosis which are often associated with autoimmune diseases. Several Coombs' <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>tests</b> were performed and did not detect autoantibodies, however, peripheral blood lymphocytes from CN dogs formed rosettes with their own erythrocytes while in normal dogs such rosettes were extremely rare. Furthermore, when lymphocytes from CN dogs were rosetted with erythrocytes from normal dogs, the numbers of allogeneic rosettes were comparable to those formed with autologous erythrocytes. These results suggest strongly that the rosetting lymphocytes are specific for common erythrocyte surface components. Although the physiological importance of the autorosetting phenomenon is not known, the frequency of autorosette formation in CN dogs, as reported here, suggests that it may be an early indication of developing autoimmune activity...|$|R
40|$|Autoimmune {{hemolytic}} anemia {{associated with an}} ovarian teratoma is a very rare disease. However, treating teratoma is the only method to cure the {{hemolytic anemia}}, so {{it is necessary to}} include ovarian teratoma in the differential diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. We report herein on a case of a young adult patient who had severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia that was induced by an ovarian teratoma. A 25 -yr-old woman complained of general weakness and dizziness for 1 week. The hemoglobin level was 4. 2 g/dL, and the direct and indirect <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>tests</b> were all positive. The abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a huge left ovarian mass, and this indicated a teratoma. She was refractory to corticosteroid therapy; however, after surgical resection of the ovarian mass, the hemoglobin level and the reticulocyte count were gradually normalized. The mass was well encapsulated and contained hair and teeth. She was diagnosed as having autoimmune hemolytic anemia associated with an ovarian teratoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such a case to be reported in Korea...|$|R
40|$|We studied 51 sera from {{patients}} with {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} to determine the relationship of their anti-phospholipid activity to their anti-erythrocyte and complement activation properties. Forty-nine per cent of the sera had anti-phospholipid activity as demonstrated by ELISA using a panel of anionic phospholipids, {{and most of these}} also bound to neutral phospholipids, albeit to a lesser extent. A cellular radioimmunoassay was used for the detection of immunoglobulin and C 3 binding to normal erythrocytes (intact, enzyme-treated or glutaraldehyde-fixed) following incubation with patient sera. The levels of IgG anti-phospholipid correlated with hypocomplementaemia and with immunoglobulin binding (paralleled by a deposition of C 3 fragments) to the three types of erythrocytes, although most strongly to fixed cells. Immunoglobulin binding to intact erythrocytes correlated primarily with reactivity against neutral phospholipids. The specificity for phospholipid epitopes of immunoglobulin adsorbed onto erythrocytes was confirmed by acid elution followed by testing in ELISA. These data suggest that some anti-phospholipid antibody subsets may bind to erythrocytes in vivo, thus accounting for the observed association of these antibodies with positive direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{positive}} screen warrants an antibody panel/investigation {{to determine}} if it is clinically significant. An antibody panel consists of commercially prepared group O red cell suspensions from donors that have been phenotyped for antigens that correspond to commonly encountered and clinically significant alloantibodies.

50|$|Chemistry tests include lactate {{dehydrogenase}} (LDH) levels, uric acid levels, {{erythrocyte sedimentation rate}} (ESR), kidney and liver function, total protein levels, and an albumin-to-globulin ratio. The ESR and uric acid level may be elevated. Creatinine is occasionally elevated and electrolytes are occasionally abnormal. A high blood calcium level is noted in approximately 4% of patients. The LDH level is frequently elevated, indicating the extent of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia-related tissue involvement. Rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulins, direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test</b> and cold agglutinin titre results can be positive. Beta-2 microglobulin and C-reactive protein test results are not specific for Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. Beta-2 microglobulin is elevated in proportion to tumor mass. Coagulation abnormalities may be present. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and fibrinogen tests should be performed. Platelet aggregation studies are optional. Serum protein electrophoresis results indicate evidence of a monoclonal spike but cannot establish the spike as IgM. An M component with beta-to-gamma mobility is highly suggestive of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. Immunoelectrophoresis and immunofixation studies help identify the type of immunoglobulin, the clonality of the light chain, and the monoclonality and quantitation of the paraprotein. High-resolution electrophoresis and serum and urine immunofixation are recommended to help identify and characterize the monoclonal IgM paraprotein.|$|E
5000|$|Acute {{hemolytic}} {{reactions are}} defined according to Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) as [...] "fever and other symptoms/signs of haemolysis within 24 hours of transfusion; confirmed {{by one or}} more of the following: a fall of Hb, rise in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), positive direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>test</b> (DAT), positive crossmatch" [...] This is due to destruction of donor red blood cells by preformed recipient antibodies. Most often this occurs due to clerical errors or improper ABO blood typing and crossmatching resulting in a mismatch in ABO blood type between the donor and the recipient. Symptoms include fever, chills, chest pain, back pain, hemorrhage, increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and rapid drop in blood pressure. When suspected, transfusion should be stopped immediately, and blood sent for tests to evaluate for presence of hemolysis. Treatment is supportive. Kidney injury may occur due to the effects of the hemolytic reaction (pigment nephropathy). In the USA in 2011 there were 48 episodes of acute hemolysis due to a mismatch in ABO blood type (1 in 495,207 blood components transfused) and 168 episodes of hemolysis due to other causes (1 in 124,525 blood components transfused).

40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) 1 occurs in dogs and like its counterpart in man, it is a multisystem disease usually affecting young adult females and often terminating in renal failure (1, 2). The typical patient with canine SLE sequentially or simultaneously develops autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura, and glomerulonephritis. In some cases symmetrical polyarthritis, dermatitis, or thyroiditis also occur. In {{addition to the}} clinical picture, the diagnosis of SLE is substantiated by laboratory findings, which include positive LE cell tests, antinuclear antibodies, complement-fixing antibodies to DNA-histone complexes, positive <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>tests,</b> and rheumatoid factor (3 - 5). There is no predilection for any particular breed to develop canine SLE, and no environmental stimuli that induce the disease have been identified. Apart from its importance in veterinary medicine, the disease in dogs provides an opportunity to study the etiology and pathogenesis of SLE in a large subhuman species.

40|$|Enzyme linked and {{agglutination}} direct <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>tests</b> {{were carried}} out on blood samples from 219 patients suspected of having autoimmune haemolysis. The enzyme linked tests were more sensitive: they could detect the small amounts of IgG, IgA, and IgM which are normally present on red cells and showed increased amounts of cell bound immunoglobulins in patients with Coombs test negative autoimmune haemolysis. Many patients had immunoglobulins {{of more than one}} class bound to their red cells; considering the degree of haemolysis in individual patients, it appeared that the different immunoglobulin classes acted synergistically in effecting red cell destruction, even in amounts too small to be detected by the agglutination tests. In patients with cold reacting autoantibodies and complement coating of the red cells active haemolysis was found (with one exception) where IgM was detected on the cells by the enzyme linked method. Elution studies indicated that immunoglobulins detected just by the enzyme linked techniques were red cell antibodies. Both enzyme linked and agglutination tests were negative in 66 patients: 61 of these had no evidence of haemolysis, and in the other five the haemolysis was not autoimmune in origin...|$|R
40|$|Cultured human {{lymphoid cells}} RPMI 8866 at {{different}} stages of their growth cycle vary in their susceptibility to lysis by rabbit, human, and guinea pig complement activated by HL-A antibodies or heterologous antibodies directed to membrane antigens; cells in G 1 phase are the least sensitive to lysis. To investigate the cause of differential susceptibility of cells RPMI 8866 to lysis, the expression of HL-A determinants and the ability of cells to react with complement were investigated. No change was detected in the density of HL-A antigens on RPMI 8866 cells in synchronous growth as determined by quantitative microabsorption assays, isotopic <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>tests</b> and yields of soluble HL-A antigens. Cells did not vary during the growth cycle in their ability to interact with complement components and in their capacity to activate the complement system through the classical or alternate pathway. These data suggest that variability in lytic susceptibility is due to changes {{in the structure of the}} cell membrane or in its ability to repair complement induced damage at certain intervals during the cell cycle. Therefore, this cell line constitutes a useful model to investigate the final steps of the cytolytic reaction...|$|R
