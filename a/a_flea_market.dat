Analyzing data from a report released in 1997 by the National Institute of Justice, fewer than 2% of convicted criminals bought their firearm at <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market</b> or gun show. About 12% purchased their firearm from a retail store or pawnshop, and 80% bought from family, friends, or an illegal source.|$|E
5|$|Norman Dolph's {{original}} acetate {{recording of}} the Scepter Studios material contains several recordings {{that would make it}} onto the final album, though many are different mixes of those recordings and three are different takes entirely. The acetate was cut on April 25, 1966, shortly after the recording sessions. It would resurface decades later when it was bought by collector Warren Hill of Montreal, Quebec, Canada in September 2002 at <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market</b> in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City for $0.75. Hill put the album up for auction on eBay in November. On December 8, 2006, a winning bid for $155,401 was placed, but not honored. The album was again placed for auction on eBay and was successfully sold on December 16, 2006 for $25,200.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{five years}} later, the Soviet Union militarily {{intervenes}} in Afghanistan. Amir and Baba escape to Peshawar, Pakistan, {{and then to}} Fremont, California, where they settle in a run-down apartment. Baba begins work at a gas station. After graduating from high school, Amir takes classes at San Jose State University to develop his writing skills. Every Sunday, Baba and Amir make extra money selling used goods at <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market</b> in San Jose. There, Amir meets fellow refugee Soraya Taheri and her family. Baba is diagnosed with terminal cancer but is still capable of granting Amir one last favor: he asks Soraya's father's permission for Amir to marry her. He agrees and the two marry. Shortly thereafter Baba dies. Amir and Soraya settle down in a happy marriage, but to their sorrow they learn that they cannot have children.|$|E

5|$|The Mountain Eagle is {{the only}} feature film {{directed}} by Hitchcock that is considered a lost film, meaning that no prints of the film are known to exist. Six surviving stills are reproduced in François Truffaut's book. More stills have recently been found to exist, {{many of which are}} reproduced in Dan Auiler's book. A lobby card for the film was found in a box of broken frames at <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market</b> in Rowley, Massachusetts. In 2012, a set of 24 still photographs were found in an archive of one of Hitchcock's close friends. Although these images gave clues to the film and its story, they were taken on the set rather than being stills from the film itself. They were auctioned off in Los Angeles for $6,000 (£3,700). Hitchcock's notebooks were also found, documenting his journey to Obergurgl, by train, horse and cart, and by foot.|$|E

25|$|In November 1993 Chinese paleontologists Zhou Zhonge, Hu Yoaming and Hou Lianhai, of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at Beijing, were {{presented}} a bird fossil bought at <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market</b> in Sihetun by amateur paleontologist Zhang He.

Soon afterwards, {{it was discovered that}} local farmers {{were in the process of}} collecting hundreds of specimens that were provisionally prepared by them to be illegally sold to commercial fossil dealers. Many hundreds have since also been added to the official collections of Chinese institutions. In 2010 the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature alone possessed 536 specimens. The fossils are compressed but otherwise typically very complete often showing the entire feathering of the animal.|$|E

500|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} to turn lynching photographs into postcards.

Woody Guthrie (1912–1967) said he recalled seeing the cards of the Nelsons for sale in Okemah.

500|$|From the 1930s, Sungei Road and its {{surrounding}} roads became <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market</b> {{better known as the}} Thieves' Market, because all sorts of second-hand merchandise as well as contraband goods were sold here. The peddlers may change from day to day and there were no receipts, so refunds are impossible. Until the British Army withdrawal in the late 1960s, it was also a place to buy army merchandise like uniforms, army gear and other army surplus, possibly looted earlier from British military stores. The open-air market soon acquired a bad reputation as the major dissemination venue for stolen goods that would last to the present day. If an item was [...] "lost" [...] recently, people can try their luck in looking for it at the Thieves' Market, and buying it back from the sellers who will always claim no knowledge of its source.|$|E
500|$|Aquemini {{begins with}} the {{introductory}} track [...] "Hold On, Be Strong", which was written by session guitarist Donny Mathis and was originally a full song with verses, but the group preferred to only use the hook. André 3000 played a kalimba on the song after purchasing the instrument at <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market,</b> drawing inspiration from Earth, Wind & Fire. [...] "Return of the G" [...] addresses concerns from fans who felt that the group's style had changed too drastically since the release of Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, {{as well as those}} who make poor decisions in order to keep their street credibility. When discussing the lyrical content of the song, André 3000 explained, [...] "I was young and wilder and some of my fashion choices people didn't accept at the time. I started getting flak from some people, so they were like, 'Either he's gay or on drugs'... 'Return of the Gangsta' was trying to give them a sense of, 'Hey, I'm still a regular person.'" [...] "Rosa Parks" [...] contains blues-influenced guitar work and folksy harmonies that [...] "announce OutKast's distinctive style of Southern boogie. The groove goes into overdrive during a clapping, foot-stomping breakdown funkified by a fierce harmonica as the kick drum pounds incessantly." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2005, Brown {{was arrested}} and charged with {{kidnapping}} an 18-year-old Vietnamese-American high school student from <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market</b> in Milton, West Virginia on October 2, 2005. [...] According to the police, Brown, allegedly upset that collectible coins he had purchased a few weeks before were worthless, returned to the flea market representing himself as a police officer, handcuffed her, and drove the girl to Kanawha County under the pretense of taking her in for questioning. The girl escaped from Brown's car a few hours later after realizing he was not an officer, according to West Virginia State Police. After the arrest, the USMC demoted Brown to Captain and involuntarily retired him at that rank on February 1, 2006. On August 14, 2009 Brown entered a Kennedy plea, meaning he did not admit guilt but did not contest that prosecutors had evidence to prove his guilt, and was convicted on a felony charge of attempting to commit kidnapping and a misdemeanor petty larceny charge in Cabell County, West Virginia Circuit Court. [...] Brown was sentenced to three years probation, two years of which were to be spent in home confinement, and agreed to pay restitution and all court costs.|$|E

500|$|Lindelof {{compared}} the film's Romulan faction to pirates with their bald, tattooed heads and disorganized costuming. Their ship, Narada, is purely practical with visible mechanics {{as it is}} a [...] "working ship", unlike the Enterprise crew who give a respectable presentation on behalf of the Federation. Chambliss was heavily influenced by the architecture of Antoni Gaudí for Narada, who created buildings that appeared to be inside out: by making the ship's exposed wires appear like bones or ligaments, it would create a foreboding atmosphere. The ship's interior was made of six pieces that could be rearranged to create a different room. The Romulan actors had three prosthetics applied to their ears and foreheads, while Bana had a fourth prosthetic for the bitemark on his ear that extends {{to the back of his}} character's head. The film's Romulans lacked the 'V'-shaped ridges on the foreheads, which had been present in all of their depictions outside the original series. Neville Page wanted to honor that by having Nero's crew ritually scar themselves too, forming keloids reminiscent of the 'V'-ridges. It was abandoned as they did not pursue the idea enough. Kaplan wanted aged, worn and rugged clothes for the Romulans because of their mining backgrounds, and found some greasy looking fabrics at <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market.</b> Kaplan tracked down the makers of those clothes, who were discovered to be based in Bali, and commissioned them to create his designs.|$|E
500|$|The hotpants {{were deemed}} [...] "iconic" [...] and {{were said to}} be the reason behind [...] "Spinning Around" [...] {{becoming}} a [...] "musical and visual anthem in 2000."

She was surprised by the attention they attracted, commenting [...] "I never imagined what impact a 50p pair of hotpants would have." [...] She also said that the revealing nature of the hotpants made her feel insecure during the shooting, saying [...] "I actually wasn't confident , that's the crazy thing. I remember feeling quite self-conscious and kept wrapping a robe around me on set and would discard [...] right before the take." [...] The garment {{is often referred to as}} [...] "those hotpants," [...] and have become a symbol for the singer's vitality and youthfulness. Considered to be one of her trademark looks, the attire she wore in the music video was put on display at Kylie: The Exhibition, an exhibition that featured [...] "costumes and memorabilia collected over Kylie's career", held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, England, and at Kylie: An Exhibition, a similar exhibition held at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia. It was also included in Minogue's official fashion photography book Kylie / Fashion, which was released on 19 November 2012 by Thames and Hudson to celebrate Minogue's completion of [...] In February 2014, Minogue donated the hotpants to the Performing Arts Collection museum at the Arts Centre in her hometown of Melbourne.|$|E
