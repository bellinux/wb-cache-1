In-mould flow influences the UD fibre architecture in two ways.

When the UD fibres are aligned with the ASMC flow direction, ply migration takes place. In general, the composite stiffness follows a rule of mixtures relationship, with the stiffness proportional to the UD fibre content. A grid analysis method has been developed to quantify distortion in the UD plies. Staging the resin to 50...|$|R
