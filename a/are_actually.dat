5|$|An {{alternative}} hypothesis suggest that lenticulae <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> small areas of chaos {{and that the}} claimed pits, spots and domes are artefacts resulting from over-interpretation of early, low-resolution Galileo images. The implication is that the ice is too thin to support the convective diapir model of feature formation.|$|E
50|$|Many {{cell lines}} that {{are widely used}} for {{biomedical}} research have been contaminated and overgrown by other, more aggressive cells. For example, supposed thyroid lines <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> melanoma cells, supposed prostate tissue <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> bladder cancer, and supposed normal uterine cultures <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> breast cancer.|$|R

5|$|Beagles may {{exhibit a}} {{behaviour}} known as reverse sneezing, {{in which they}} sound {{as if they are}} choking or gasping for breath, but <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> drawing air in through the mouth and nose. The exact cause of this behaviour is not known, but it can be a common occurrence and is not harmful to the dog.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{rarity of}} the {{syndrome}} itself, {{it is hard}} to determine whether certain additional diseases <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> part of the syndrome. With a base population of possibly less than one thousand individuals, one or two outlying cases can skew the statistical population very quickly.|$|E
5|$|I am not {{too sure}} if John {{actually}} fully {{understood what he}} was saying. He knew he was onto something when he saw those words and turned them into a song.

50|$|Though {{the film}} {{takes place in}} various places {{throughout}} the U.S., the entire movie <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> filmed in New Mexico (except the beach on the West Coast at the end).

5|$|Jackrabbits <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> hares {{rather than}} rabbits though both are mammals {{in the order}} Lagomorpha. Wyoming is home to three species of hares, all in the genus Lepus. These are the black-tailed jackrabbit, the white-tailed jackrabbit, and the snowshoe hare.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} {{consistently}} shown that pelicans, the namesake {{family of the}} Pelecaniformes, <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> {{more closely related to}} herons, ibises and spoonbills, the hamerkop and the shoebill than to the remaining species. In recognition of this, the order comprising the frigatebirds and Suloidea was renamed Suliformes in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Most gamma-ray {{emitting}} sources <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> gamma-ray bursts, objects {{which only}} produce gamma radiation {{for a few}} milliseconds to thousands of seconds before fading away. Only 10% of gamma-ray sources are non-transient sources. These steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars, neutron stars, and black hole candidates such as active galactic nuclei.|$|E
30|$|First, {{note that}} we have the {{following}} four possible scenarios considering the correct detections and errors in channel sensing: Scenario 1 : All channels are detected as busy, and channel used for transmission <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> busy. Scenario 2 : All channels are detected as busy, and channel used for transmission <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> idle. Scenario 3 : At least one channel is detected as idle, and channel used for transmission <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> busy.

5|$|The data pins in the {{standard}} plugs <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> recessed in the plug compared to the outside power pins. This permits the power pins to connect first, preventing data errors by allowing the device to power up first and then establish the data connection.

5|$|Three {{divergent}} lineages {{found in}} Yunnan province in China that are commonly marketed and sold as B. edulis (and <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> {{more closely related}} to B. aereus) were described in 2013 as B. bainiugan, B. meiweiniuganjun and B. shiyong.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 {{study by}} John Fregeau of 13 {{globular}} clusters in the Milky Way shows {{that three of}} them have an unusually large number of X-ray sources, or X-ray binaries, suggesting the clusters are middle-aged. Previously, these globular clusters had been classified as being in old age because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers, another test of age used by astronomers. The implication is that most globular clusters, including the other ten studied by Fregeau, are not in middle age as previously thought, but <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> in 'adolescence'.|$|E

5|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} Ponnar and Sankar <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> Thamarai's sons and that Rakki, {{who was then}} a servant of Nellaiyankondan, had saved the twins as small children from Mandhiyappan. Mandhiyappan had attempted to avenge himself on Thamarai for rejecting his hand in marriage. He learns that the twins are still alive and hatches a conspiracy to kill them. He tricks Kali Mannan (Napoleon) and Thamarai's father into helping him. This leads to an intense battle which ends with good prevailing over evil.|$|E
5|$|Although certain {{levels of}} {{antioxidant}} vitamins {{in the diet}} are required for good health, there is considerable debate on whether antioxidant-rich foods or supplements have anti-disease activity. Moreover, if they <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> beneficial, it is unknown which antioxidant(s) are needed from the diet and in what amounts beyond typical dietary intake. Some authors dispute the hypothesis that antioxidant vitamins could prevent chronic diseases, while others maintain such a possibility is unproved and misguided from the beginning.|$|E
5|$|Although these criticisms still {{form the}} {{prevailing}} {{view on the}} History's literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, its use of allusion {{as a vehicle for}} parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> an intentional and integral part of the work, {{making it one of the}} most unique pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.|$|E

5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of Carcharocles, proposed in 2001 by paleontologist Michael Benton, is that the three other species <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> a single species of shark that gradually changed over time between the Paleocene and the Pliocene, making it a chronospecies. Some authors suggest that C. auriculatus, C. angustidens, and C. chubutensis should be classified as a single species in the genus Otodus, leaving C. megalodon the sole member of Carcharocles.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, most DNA {{molecules}} <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> two polymer strands, {{bound together}} in a helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (dsDNA) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart‚Äì {{a process known as}} melting‚Äì to form two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).|$|E
50|$|Just as the {{category}} known as Cat, which is {{the category}} of small categories and functors <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> a 2-category with natural transformations as its 2-morphisms, the category n-Cat of (small) n-categories <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> an (n+1)-category.|$|R
