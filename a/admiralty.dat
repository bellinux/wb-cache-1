5|$|No <b>Admiralty</b> {{camouflage}} {{section was}} established until October 1940. <b>Admiralty</b> camouflage schemes promulgated in 1941 were not universally adopted because of difficulties with operating schedules and shortages of some paint pigments. Nearly all destroyers and larger ships wore an <b>Admiralty</b> disruptive camouflage scheme by late 1942; but Commonwealth captains executed official camouflage schemes with greater variation than was customary with American measures.|$|E
5|$|Seymour {{had joined}} the <b>Admiralty</b> in 1795, {{becoming}} a Lord of the <b>Admiralty</b> and participating {{in much of the}} work the <b>Admiralty</b> board performed between 1795 and 1798, interposing his periods on land with brief sea commissions. In 1799, Seymour became a vice-admiral and joined the squadron blockading Brest for the next year, being involved in a minor operation against Basque Roads.|$|E
5|$|<b>Admiralty</b> {{law is the}} {{particular}} body of national laws applied to maritime questions and offenses, as the uncertainty of sea voyages has caused the sea {{to be viewed as}} a unique jurisdiction since antiquity. Rhodian, Roman, Byzantine, Trani, and Amalfian laws were important influences on the French, Genovese, and Hanseatic codes which established the first English courts of <b>admiralty.</b> Unlike the usual English common law system, the courts of <b>admiralty</b> hewed closer to Continental practice, leaving it open for abuse that contributed to the American Revolution. The adoption of the present constitution reintroduced <b>admiralty</b> law to the United States, but with a relatively larger sphere for trials by jury.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason for}} {{the large number of}} squadrons was that the smaller Dutch <b>admiralties</b> — and the many new flag {{officers}} recently appointed by them — insisted on having their own squadron; the <b>Admiralties</b> of Amsterdam and the Maas (i.e. Rotterdam) then split their fleets to make squadrons of equal size to those of the smaller fleets.|$|R
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war in 1914, Bruce's prospecting ventures were on hold. He offered his services to the <b>Admiralty,</b> but failed to obtain an appointment. In 1915 he accepted a post as director and manager of a whaling company based in the Seychelles, and spent four months there, but the venture failed. On his return to Britain he finally secured a minor post at the <b>Admiralty.</b>|$|E
5|$|In January 1917, the Board of <b>Admiralty</b> {{reviewed}} the navy's aircraft carrier requirements {{and decided to}} order two ships fitted with a flying-off deck {{as well as a}} landing deck aft. The initial order had to be cancelled in April 1917 for lack of building facilities, so the <b>Admiralty</b> decided to convert Cavendish, already under construction, in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of 1917 the <b>Admiralty</b> became more {{concerned}} about German efforts in the North Sea to sweep paths through the British-laid minefields intended to restrict {{the actions of the}} High Seas Fleet and German submarines. A preliminary raid on German minesweeping forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed ten small ships and the <b>Admiralty</b> decided on a larger operation to destroy the minesweepers and their escorting light cruisers. Based on intelligence reports the <b>Admiralty</b> decided on 17 November 1917 to allocate two light cruiser squadrons, the 1st Cruiser Squadron covered by the reinforced 1st BCS (less Renown) and, more distantly, the battleships of the 1st Battle Squadron to the operation.|$|E

5|$|Those who {{witnessed}} the collision were sworn to secrecy due to national security concerns. The loss was not publicly reported until after the war ended, although the <b>Admiralty</b> filed a writ against Queen Marys owners, Cunard White Star Line, on 22 September 1943 in the <b>Admiralty</b> Court of the High Court of Justice. Little happened until 1945, when the case went to trial in June; it was adjourned to November and then to December 1946. Mr. Justice Pilcher exonerated the Queen Marys crew and her owners from blame on 21 January 1947 and laid all fault on Curacoas officers. The <b>Admiralty</b> appealed his ruling and the Court of Appeal modified the ruling, assigning two-thirds of the blame to the <b>Admiralty</b> and one third to Cunard White Star. The latter appealed to the House of Lords, but they upheld the decision.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1917 the <b>Admiralty</b> was {{becoming}} more concerned about German efforts to sweep paths through the British-laid minefields intended to restrict {{the actions of the}} High Seas Fleet and German submarines. A preliminary raid on German minesweeping forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed 10 small ships and the <b>Admiralty</b> decided on a larger operation to destroy the minesweepers and their light cruiser escorts. Based on intelligence reports, the <b>Admiralty</b> allocated the 1st Cruiser Squadron on 17 November 1917, with cover provided by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and distant cover by the battleships of the 1st Battle Squadron.|$|E
5|$|For the Japanese, {{the loss}} of the <b>Admiralties</b> meant {{the loss of}} their outpost line in the South Eastern Area. Imperial Headquarters now ordered the {{preparation}} of a new line in Western New Guinea. The <b>Admiralties</b> operation also indicated the Allies were becoming more ambitious and might bypass Hansa Bay. Accordingly, the Eighteenth Army in New Guinea was ordered to prepare to defend Aitape and Wewak as well.|$|R

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Melbourne and Cambridge University, where he earned his doctorate at the Cavendish Laboratory, Massey became an independent lecturer in Mathematical Physics at the Queen's University of Belfast in 1933. He was appointed Goldsmid Professor of Applied Mathematics at University College London, in 1938. During the Second World War, Massey worked at the <b>Admiralty</b> Research Laboratory , where he helped devise countermeasures for German magnetic naval mines, and at the <b>Admiralty</b> Mining Establishment in Havant, where he helped develop British naval mines. In 1943, Mark Oliphant persuaded the <b>Admiralty</b> to release Massey {{to work on the}} Manhattan Project. He joined Oliphant's British Mission at the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, where they worked on the electromagnetic isotope separation process. When Oliphant returned to Britain in 1945, Massey took over the Berkeley Mission.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing number}} of people, among them Captain William Rooke Creswell, the {{director}} of the Commonwealth Naval Forces, demanded an autonomous Australian navy, financed and controlled by Australia. In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and Creswell, while attending the Imperial Conference in London, sought the British Government's agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy. The <b>Admiralty</b> rejected and resented the challenge, but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient. Deakin was not impressed with the <b>Admiralty,</b> and in 1908 invited the United States Great White Fleet to visit Australia. The visit prompted public enthusiasm for a modern navy and led to the order of two 700-ton s, a purchase that angered the British. The surge in German naval construction in 1909 led the Australian <b>admiralty</b> to change its position on an Australian navy, which resulted in the Naval Defence Act of 1910 being passed which created the Australian navy.|$|E
500|$|The Japanese defence of the <b>Admiralties</b> {{fell under}} the Eighth Area Army, based at Rabaul and {{commanded}} by General Hitoshi Imamura. In September 1943, {{as a result of}} the failure to stop Allied advances in New Guinea and the Solomons, the Imperial General Headquarters (IGHQ) had decided to constrict Japan's defensive perimeter in the south and central Pacific to a new line stretching from the Banda Sea to the Caroline Islands. The IGHQ charged Imamura with holding his portion of the new line, which included the <b>Admiralties,</b> as long as possible to allow the Japanese navy and army time to prepare [...] "decisive" [...] counterattacks against Allied forces. Maintaining control of the <b>Admiralties</b> was crucial to the Japanese defensive plans, as possession of the islands by the Allies would place the key Japanese stronghold at Truk within range of heavy bombers. Apparently not expecting the Allies to move on the <b>Admiralties</b> so quickly, IGHQ gave Imamura until the middle of 1944 to complete the defensive preparations for his command. At this time the largest Japanese unit in the islands was the 51st Transport Regiment, which had arrived on Los Negros in April.|$|R

5|$|Anne refused {{initially}} {{to appoint a}} new Lord High Admiral, and insisted on carrying out {{the duties of the}} office herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's place. She burst into tears on the first occasion she was brought papers to sign in George's stead. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of Lord Orford, a member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as First Lord of the <b>Admiralty.</b> Admiral Churchill retired, and Anne appointed the moderate Tory Lord Pembroke to lead the <b>Admiralty,</b> instead of a Whig. The Junto Whigs Somers and Wharton, however, were appointed to the Cabinet in Pembroke's vacated posts of Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The Whigs were still dissatisfied, and continued to pressure Pembroke and the Queen. Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the <b>Admiralty</b> as First Lord in November 1709.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{tendering}} process, {{the four}} G3 battlecruisers were ordered on 24 October 1921, without names, from John Brown, Swan Hunter, William Beardmore and Fairfield. Following the visit of an <b>Admiralty</b> delegation, detailed constructional drawings were sent to John Brown on 3 November with a request that copies be urgently circulated to the other successful contractors. Work at John Brown progressed on the keel blocks and hull plates for the subsequent two weeks. Notwithstanding other events, instructions and amendments continued to arrive from various departments within the <b>Admiralty</b> until 25 November.|$|E

After 1787, Van der Hoop left, his political ambitions disappointed by the passive attitude of the stadholder, and withdrew from public life.|$|R

5|$|Following the court-martial of {{the five}} ringleaders, there was debate among the public, in the media, and within {{government}} over the sentences; while most agreed that a mutiny had occurred, there were differences in opinion on the leniency or severity of the punishments imposed. Public sympathy was with the sailors, and several politicians pressured {{the government and the}} <b>Admiralty</b> to pardon the men. The <b>Admiralty</b> thought the sentences were fair, but on 10 September announced that they would be halved on consideration of the sailors' youth. Despite this, controversy continued until 21 November: after the Australian government appealed directly to the <b>Admiralty,</b> it was agreed that the sailors would be released on 20 December. However, the government had angered the Naval Board in appealing to the <b>Admiralty</b> without consulting the Board first. The First Naval Member, Rear Admiral Percy Grant and Commander of the Fleet, Commodore John Dumaresq, submitted their resignations in protest, as they felt the show of clemency would lead to a breakdown in discipline, and that if the government continued to communicate with the <b>Admiralty</b> without consulting the Board, it would undermine the Board's authority. The two officers were later convinced to withdraw their resignations after receiving assurances that Board would be consulted before all future government communications to Britain regarding the RAN, and that notices would be posted in all ships explaining that the sentences were correct, but the onset of peace had led to clemency in this particular case.|$|E
5|$|From mid-1940, {{ships of}} the RAN, {{at the request}} of the <b>Admiralty,</b> began to deploy to the Mediterranean Sea to take part in the Battle of the Mediterranean against Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. In September 1939, the <b>Admiralty</b> and the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board agreed to deploy the RAN Destroyer Flotilla outside the Australia Station; the five ships of what was to become known as the Scrap Iron Flotilla arrived at Malta in mid-December. HMAS Sydney {{deployed}} in May 1940 and was later joined by Hobart. When Italy declared war on 10 June 1940, the Australian warships made up five of the twenty-two Allied destroyers and one of the five modern light cruisers on station in the Mediterranean. The RAN then offered the services of Australia to the <b>Admiralty,</b> and was accepted. When Australia arrived in the Mediterranean, the RAN had sent nearly the entire combat fleet to the Northern Hemisphere, leaving Australia open to possible attack.|$|E
5|$|He {{retained}} command until September 1938, when he {{was appointed}} to the <b>Admiralty</b> as Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff, although he did not actually take up this post until December 1939. He accepted this shore job with reluctance since he loathed administration, but the Board of Admiralty's high regard of him was evident. For six months during an illness of Admiral Sir Roger Backhouse, the then First Sea Lord, he deputised for Backhouse on the Committee of Imperial Defence and on the <b>Admiralty</b> Board. In 1939 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB), becoming known as Sir Andrew Cunningham.|$|E
50|$|Resuming ASW {{training}} duties, S-42 {{remained in}} the <b>Admiralties</b> into October. At mid-month, she arrived at Brisbane for overhaul; and, in January 1945, {{she returned to the}} <b>Admiralties.</b> In mid-February, she departed Manus for California, arriving at San Diego at the end of March. There, she provided training services for the West Coast Sound School through the end of World War II. In September, she shifted to San Francisco, California, where she was decommissioned on 25 October 1945. Stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 November, she was sold for scrapping in November 1946.|$|R

500|$|Imamura sought {{reinforcements}} for the <b>Admiralties</b> in late 1943 {{and early}} 1944. In October 1943 he requested an infantry division for the islands, but none was available. A subsequent proposal {{to transfer the}} 66th Regiment from the Palaus, where it was being rebuilt after suffering heavy losses, to the <b>Admiralties</b> was also unsuccessful as IGHQ believed that the Eighteenth Army had greater need for this unit. The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) also rejected Imamura's suggestion that a special naval landing force unit be dispatched to the islands. IGHQ agreed to deploy the 66th Regiment to the <b>Admiralties</b> in January 1944 to bolster the region's defenses following the Allied landings at Arawe and Saidor in mid-December and early January respectively, but this movement was cancelled after a ship carrying reinforcements for the regiment was sunk by [...] with heavy loss {{of life on the}} 16th of the month. Following this disaster Imamura directed the 38th Division to dispatch a battalion to the islands, and 750 men of the 2ndBattalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment arrived there on the night of 24/25 January. A subsequent attempt to ship an infantry and an artillery battalion to the <b>Admiralties</b> was frustrated by Allied air and submarine attacks, but 530 soldiers of the 38th Division's 1stBattalion, 229th Infantry Regiment arrived there on the night of 2 February. Most of these troop movements were detected by Allied intelligence.|$|R
