5|$|The Terrapins, with {{a perfect}} ACC record, were named conference co-champions {{alongside}} Duke {{for the second consecutive}} year.

To commemorate the victims of the Armenian Genocide, 24 April is observed as Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day.

5|$|Arsenal again went on {{the attack}} as the second half began, with another corner won {{following}} a header by Buchan. Hulme drifted in a well placed cross, but nothing was made of it. It was then Cardiff's turn to attack. Curtis sent in a low shot which was saved by Lewis in the Arsenal goal. Shortly afterwards, Butler, the Arsenal midfielder, was struck hard in the face by the ball causing a brief delay to play. The game resumed, and McLachlan took it down the wing for Cardiff, who passed it to Davies, but his shot was just wide of the post. Buchan attempted to return the game to Arsenal's tempo, with a long pass to the left wing for Hoar, but Cardiff City's James Nelson had him covered. City's attacking continued, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> was had by Hardy which appeared to shake Lewis in goal as the keeper didn't gather the ball cleanly.|$|E

5|$|It {{had long}} been Markham's {{practice}} {{to take note of}} promising young naval officers who might later be suitable for polar responsibilities, should the opportunity arise. He had first observed Midshipman Robert Falcon Scott in 1887, while the latter was serving with HMS Rover in St Kitts, and had remembered him. Thirteen years later, Scott, by now a Torpedo Lieutenant on , was looking for a path to career advancement, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> meeting with Sir Clements in London led him to apply for the leadership of the expedition. Scott {{had long been}} in Markham's mind, though by no means always his first choice, but other favoured candidates had either become in his view too old, or were no longer available. With Markham's determined backing, Scott's appointment was secured by 25 May 1900, followed swiftly by his promotion to Commander.|$|E
5|$|Promotion, and {{the extra}} income this would bring, now became a matter of {{considerable}} concern to Scott. In the Royal Navy however, opportunities for career advancement were both limited and keenly sought after by ambitious officers. Early in June 1899, while home on leave, {{he had a chance}} encounter in a London street with Clements Markham, who was now knighted and President of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), and learned for the first time of an impending Antarctic expedition with the Discovery, {{under the auspices of the}} RGS. It was the opportunity for early command <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to distinguish himself, rather than any predilection for polar exploration which motivated Scott, according to Crane. What passed between them on this occasion is not recorded, but a few days later, on 11 June, Scott appeared at the Markham residence and volunteered to lead the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The {{first round}} is an {{elimination}} {{game in which}} the eight cats are {{placed in front of}} a bowl of cat food. The three cats which have eaten the most food when time expires move on to the second round; those who are eliminated earn $1,000. The three remaining owners answer trivia questions for points. The format is similar to Jeopardy! with six cat-related CATegories containing questions ranging from 10 to 50 points. The lowest-scoring owner is eliminated with $10,000. The two remaining cats are each then recorded in seven different situations. The owners wager points on what their cat will do before each clip is shown. They may not wager more than half of their points on the first two questions. For the remainder, they may wager any or all of their points. The cat and owner with the highest score win $25,000, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to play the bonus round; the eliminated contestant earns $15,000.|$|E

Davidson scored 374 runs at 34.00 including three fifties and took 30 wicket at 27.50 from eight matches.

The score gave California its first lead since the first drive of the game, and with 5:52remaining in the quarter, the scoreboard read 35–28, California. Following the touchdown, Virginia Tech received the ball and had its first three {{and out of the}} game. Tech was forced to punt after running three plays for four yards.|$|E

5|$|Birmingham won the toss and Manchester City kicked off. The Birmingham goal {{came under}} {{pressure}} almost immediately. Within a minute a far post cross from Roy Clarke narrowly eluded Hayes. Two corners followed, the second {{resulting in a}} shot by Roy Paul. The next attack, in the third minute, resulted in the opening goal. Revie began the move, exchanging passes with Clarke, and back-heeling for the unmarked Hayes to sweep the ball past Gil Merrick to put Manchester City ahead. Birmingham's confidence was shaken, resulting {{in a series of}} Manchester City corners <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for Hayes, but they fought back to equalise in the 15thminute. Astall slipped the ball to Brown, who helped it forward. It rebounded off a Manchester City defender into the path of Welsh international inside‑forward Noel Kinsey, who fired home via Trautmann's far post. For the remainder of the first half Birmingham had most of the play, exerting pressure on Manchester City full-back Leivers, but were unable to make a breakthrough. Though Birmingham put the ball in the net twice, Brown was adjudged to be offside on both occasions. With Warhurst missing and Boyd out of position and not fully fit, Birmingham's strength and balance was disrupted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to Manchester City's unconventional style.|$|E
5|$|The 2007–08 season saw Central Coast win {{its first}} premiership on goal {{difference}} ahead of Newcastle, following a final round {{that began with}} Central Coast and three other clubs level on 31 points. The final series began with a 2–0 loss to Newcastle in {{the first leg of}} its major semi-final, but the Mariners forced the tie to extra time by holding a 2–0 lead in the second leg after 90 minutes. A 94th-minute goal by Sasho Petrovski, who had scored earlier to level the tie, gave Central Coast a 3–2 win on aggregate, putting the Mariners through to the 2008 A-League Grand Final. In a rematch with Newcastle, the Jets defeated Central Coast 1–0 in the Grand Final, which ended in controversy due to an uncalled handball against Newcastle in Central Coast Mariners penalty box during the closing seconds of the match. If called, the foul would have given Central Coast a penalty kick <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to equalise. As Mariners players disputed referee Mark Shield's decision, goalkeeper Danny Vuković struck Shield on the arm, resulting in an immediate sending off and later suspension. Vuković was suspended from both domestic and international competition for nine months, with an additional six-months' suspended ban; the latter period was reduced to three months on appeal. Despite further appeals, the ban was eventually confirmed by FIFA in June, to include banning the young keeper from competing at the 2008 Olympic Games. The ban lasted into October; in response, Central Coast signed former Manchester United and Australian international keeper Mark Bosnich on a seven-week contract.|$|E
