40|$|Objective: To {{review a}} large number of equine overground {{endoscopy}} (OGE) examinations to determine the incidence of dynamic upper airway obstructions (DUAO); correlations were explored with laryngeal endoscopy findings at rest and <b>abnormal</b> exercising respiratory <b>noise.</b> Methods: Retrospective analysis of horses presenting for OGE because of perceived poor performance and/or history of <b>abnormal</b> exercising respiratory <b>noise</b> between 2010 and 2014. Signalment, history and examination findings during resting laryngeal endoscopy and OGE were reviewed. Results: Of the total examinations, 311 were reviewed. One or more DUAO were found in 249 / 311 horses. From 210 males (colts and geldings), 121 had arytenoid cartilage collapse (ACC) and 111 had vocal fold collapse (VFC). From 101 females, 25 had intermittent dorsal displacement of the soft palate (DDSP). Resting laryngeal function grade 4 was found in 121 / 311 of the study population and 92 / 210 of males. An association was found between horses with lower resting arytenoid abduction ability to dynamic ACC and higher resting arytenoid abduction ability with DDSP. <b>Abnormal</b> exercising respiratory <b>noise</b> was positively associated with the presence of DUAO.

40|$|Overground {{endoscopy}} {{is being}} performed {{with increasing frequency}} in the UK. A previous study {{has shown that the}} type of exercise test may affect the diagnosis of upper respiratory tract (URT) obstructions. The successful clinical application of overground endoscopy systems requires understanding of appropriate field exercise testing protocols. The aim {{of this study was to}} report the exercise test parameters used during overground endoscopy in UK Thoroughbred racehorses and to investigate potential effects of these on the diagnosis of URT obstructions. The exercise test parameters used and the endoscopic observations of the URT during exercise were recorded for 140 Thoroughbred racehorses referred for the investigation of abnormal respiratory noise and/or poor athletic performance. The exercise test parameters varied widely between horses. The presenting complaint was easiest to reproduce in horses with a history of <b>abnormal</b> <b>noise</b> in training and hardest to reproduce in those referred for investigation of poor performance with no <b>abnormal</b> <b>noise.</b> No associations between the presence or not of an URT obstruction and exercise test parameters was identified. For horses referred for <b>abnormal</b> <b>noise</b> during racing DDSP was more likely to be observed when longer distances were performed. It is difficult to standardise exercise tests in the field when multiple premises are used and when training gallops differ markedly to racecourses. It was not possible to establish exercise test protocols which should be used for all Thoroughbred racehorses. Therefore, at present the best advice for horses which make <b>abnormal</b> <b>noise</b> during a race or have poor race performance, can only be to replicate race conditions as closely as possible. For horses that race over longer distances this will require the use of a circular gallops (e. g. racecourse) if only short gallops are available at the trainer's premises. K. J. Allen and S. H.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>abnormal</b> <b>noise</b> {{was found}} in a marine {{planetary}} gearbox during the experiment. Then, the load test of the gearbox was done on a gearbox test rig and the vibration signal was measured and collected.

The method used in this paper combined the theory analysis with engineering application. Simultaneously, it has provided a properly feasible method and valuable reference for the fault diagnosis of planetary gearbox. Introduction.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the lower}} Rhône Valley (France), the Tricastin area was struck in 2002 – 2003 by an {{earthquake}} swarm {{with a maximum}} ML-magnitude of 1. 7. These shocks would have gone unnoticed {{if they had not}} occurred beneath habitations and close to the surface, some events being only 200 -m deep. A several months' monitoring of the seismic activity by a 16 -station mobile network showed that earthquakes clustered along a N–S-trending, at least 5 -km long, shallow rupture zone, with no corresponding fault mapped in the surface. Half of the seismic events occurred in a massive, c. 250 -m-thick, Lower Cretaceous limestone slab that outcrops near by. Since the late eighteenth century, several much more severe earthquake swarms have struck Tricastin. The 1772 – 1773 and 1933 – 1936 swarms were prolific and protracted, with reports of numerous detonations and even damage.

Horses included 2 showjumpers, one eventer, one pleasure riding horse and 2 Thoroughbred racehorses. All were adults (age range: 4 – 10 years). Dorsal angulation of the epiglottis was identified at rest in one horse. However, resting endoscopy was unremarkable {{in the remaining}} 5 horses. Exercising endoscopy was performed during high-speed treadmill exercise in 3 horses and during ridden exercise in the other 3. Intermittent ER occurred during inspiration in all horses and the frequency increased with increasing speed. In 2 horses the epiglottis retroverted beyond the rima glottidis. All horses made an <b>abnormal</b> respiratory <b>noise</b> described as a ‘grunt’ when retroversion of the epiglottis occurred.

Horses with VRDDLM were identified as those in which the dorsal laryngeal mucosa progressively obscured the interarytenoid notch and dorsoaxial portion of the corniculate processes of the arytenoid cartilages during high-speed exercise. The condition was recognised in 12 horses. Concurrent abnormalities of the respiratory tract of eight horses were also identified and included, axial deviation of the aryepiglottic folds, vocal cord prolapse, unilateral and bilateral ventromedial luxation of the apex of the corniculate process of the arytenoid cartilage, and intermittent dorsal displacement of the soft palate. VRDDLM is a rare abnormality of the upper portion of the respiratory tract of horses that may be associated with <b>abnormal</b> respiratory <b>noise</b> and potentially poor performance.

Data retrieved and analyzed were reason of presentation, clinical signs, diagnostic techniques, surgical treatment, complications, and outcome. Results: Common presenting clinical signs were <b>abnormal</b> respiratory <b>noise,</b> nasal discharge, and abnormal respiratory effort. Mean age of affected cattle was 21. 7 months. In 9 animals, cysts were identified by endoscopy. Radiographic signs included a mass in the paranasal sinuses or conchae (13), nasal septum deviation (12), fluid lines (10), and bone atrophy (5). Ten cattle were treated surgically with osteoplastic flap techniques {{to gain access to}} the frontal or maxillary sinus (5), nasal extraction of the cyst under endoscopic control (3) or a combination of both techniques (2).
