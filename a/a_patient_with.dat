40|$|Introduction: Hemophilia <b>A</b> <b>patients</b> have <b>a</b> 50 % lower {{cardiovascular}} mortality {{than the}} general population. Whether this is caused by less atherosclerosis due to hypocoagulability is unclear. We assessed whether hemophilia <b>A</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> obesity, <b>a</b> major atherosclerotic risk factor, have a lower prevalence of 'subclinical' atherosclerosis than obese controls. Methods: Fifty obese (body mass index [BMI] > 30 kg/m 2) and 48 normal-weight (BMI 1. 3 mm, P = 0. 11), irrespective {{of the severity of}} hemophilia. (Figure presented) Conclusion: Hemophilia <b>A</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> obesity have the same degree of subclinical atherosclerosis as obese control subjects, which suggests that the lower cardiovascular mortality is likely caused by a decreased risk of arterial thrombosis...|$|R

40|$|The nonactivated {{prothrombin}} complex concentrate (PCC) Octaplex (Octapharma PPGmbH, Vienna, Austria) {{has been}} used successfully {{for the treatment of}} congenital and acquired coagulation factor deficiencies and associated bleeding. The aims of this study were to assess retrospectively whether Octaplex is an effective treatment option for haemophilia <b>A</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> high-titre inhibitors of factor VIII (FVIII) and to investigate the impact of Octaplex on thrombin generation in vitro and ex vivo. Retrospective data were collected from 15 haemophilia <b>A</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> FVIII inhibitors who had been treated with Octaplex. Mild bleeds were treated for a median of 1 day with a median dose of 77 IU/kg and moderate bleeds for 3 days with 57 IU/kg. The physician's overall satisfaction with Octaplex, taking into account efficacy, safety and cost in comparison with other treatment options, was assessed for each bleed. The overall rating was good, very good or excellent for 29 of 41 (71 %) bleeds. No adverse drug reactions were reported. In in-vitro studies of thrombin generation with normal plasma samples, experimental inhibition of FVIII activity prolonged the lag phase, diminished the peak thrombin concentration and decreased the area under the concentration-time curve, as expected. Marked improvement in thrombin generation parameters was achieved by adding 0. 5 - 3 IU factor IX/ml PCC into the samples. The same held true when using plasma samples from haemophilia <b>A</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> FVIII inhibitors. These results demonstrate that Octaplex overcomes inhibition of FVIII in in-vitro and ex-vivo assays of thrombin generation, and that Octaplex is an effective treatment option for haemophilia <b>A</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> FVIII inhibitors...|$|R
5|$|After several {{case reports}} in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{periodic}} paralysis was first described in full by the German neurologist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833â€“1890) in 1885. In 1926 the Japanese physician Tetsushiro Shinosaki, from Fukuoka, observed {{the high rate of}} thyroid disease in Japanese people with periodic paralysis. The first English-language report, in 1931, originated from Dunlap and Kepler, physicians at the Mayo Clinic; they described the condition in <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> features of Graves' disease.

Target 3 D reconstruction was carried out with the use of 3 D Fly Through program (Toshiba Medical Systems, Japan) which removed the tissue surrounding CSG at a distance of 5 â€“ 10 mm from the outer boundaries.
