The technology relies on through-silicon vias, <b>advanced</b> <b>thinning</b> of silicon wafers and copper/tin-copper solid-liquid diffusion bonding to produce vertical interconnects at a density of 1 × 106 /cm 2.

40|$|We {{present a}} case series of cornea and {{anterior}} segment disorders investigated by an office-based polarization-sensitive {{optical coherence tomography}} (PS-OCT). Blebs of glaucoma patients treated by trabeculectomy, and corneas of keratoconus and keratoplasty patients were measured by PS-OCT. Birefringence formations in trabeculectomy bleb were measured in 1 control eye and 3 eyes of trabeculectomy model rabbits. Polarization insensitive scattering OCT and the depth-resolved birefringence were measured simultaneously by PS-OCT. Abnormal birefringence was observed in keratoconus cases with <b>advanced</b> <b>thinning</b> and with a rupture of Descemet’s membrane. The graft-host interface of the keratoplasty case showed abnormal birefringence. The appearance of abnormal birefringence in the cornea {{was likely to be}} an indication of cross-linking of collagen fibrils. The measurement of rabbit showed abnormal birefringence in the scarring eyes. Wide regions of strong birefringence were observed in the eyes of trabeculectomy patients who had high intraocular pressure. Visualization of scarring in bleb by PS-OCT may be useful for the planning of secondary surgery. PS-OCT showed promising for the study and diagnosis diseases related to abnormal fibrous tissues of the cornea and anterior eye segment...|$|E
