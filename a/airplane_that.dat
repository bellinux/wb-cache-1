5|$|In 1935, Indiana Jones {{narrowly}} escapes {{the clutches}} of Lao Che, a crime boss in Shanghai, China. With his 11-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indy flees Shanghai on an <b>airplane</b> <b>that,</b> unknown to them, is owned by Lao. While {{the three of them}} sleep on the plane, the pilots parachute out, and they leave the plane to crash over the Himalayas while dumping its fuel. Indy, Shorty, and Willie discover this and narrowly manage to escape by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft, and then riding down the slopes into a raging river. They come to Mayapore, a village in northern India, where the poor villagers believe them to have been sent by Shiva to retrieve the sacred sivalinga stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. During the journey to Pankot, Indy hypothesizes that the stone {{may be one of the}} five fabled Sankara stones that promise fortune and glory.|$|E

5|$|On June 19, 1964, Kennedy was a {{passenger}} {{in a private}} Aero Commander 680 <b>airplane</b> <b>that</b> was flying in bad weather from Washington to Massachusetts. The plane crashed into an apple orchard in the western Massachusetts town of Southampton on the final approach to the Barnes Municipal Airport in Westfield. The pilot and Edward Moss (one of Kennedy's aides) were killed. Kennedy was pulled from the wreckage by fellow Senator Birch Bayh and spent months in a hospital recovering from a severe back injury, a punctured lung, broken ribs and internal bleeding. He suffered chronic back pain {{for the rest of}} his life as a result of the accident. Kennedy took advantage of his long convalescence to meet with academics and study issues more closely, and the hospital experience triggered his lifelong interest in the provision of health care services. His wife Joan did the campaigning for him in the regular 1964 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, and he defeated his Republican opponent by a three-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene with}} Peter in the hypnotherapist's office was censored from television, as Peter {{discusses}} his genitals and reproductive organs. When Peter {{comes to the}} realization that Francis is not his real father and when Stewie dreams about being tortured by Lois, a harp sound can be heard; MacFarlane comments that even small things like that take {{a lot of work to}} produce. The alcohol bottles being pushed by the <b>airplane</b> <b>that</b> Peter and Brian are traveling on were animated by computer, as is the taxi driving along the street. On the DVD commentary, MacFarlane notes that the scene would not have looked good without computer aid. He said it makes the animations seem more realistic than without a computer. The two men circling each other for fifty years and waiting for the other to throw the first punch was not broadcast for television.|$|E
5|$|Although {{enjoyment}} {{factored into}} Culverhouse's {{purchase of the}} Buccaneers, it was {{first and foremost a}} business decision which he expected to be profitable. He admitted to being known for his frugality, due to moves such as wearing outdated clothing, and having the One Buc Place walls painted white to avoid having to spend money on projection screens. This was not initially a problem for the franchise, even though the budget <b>airplane</b> <b>that</b> Culverhouse chartered for the team almost crashed after their very first game; original coach John McKay reported in 1978 that Culverhouse had never blocked any deals, even those involving a great amount of money. Later, however, the team let go or traded away many of its players who were highly paid and/or demanded more money, including Dave Pear, Doug Williams, Ricky Reynolds, Reggie Cobb, Mark Carrier, and Jeris White. First-round draft choices were frequently traded for players who were not considered to be of equal value, as when the team traded for often-injured defensive end Wally Chambers without requiring that he first pass a physical examination. Frustration over being beaten by players he had pleaded with Culverhouse to sign contributed to the resignation of McKay. He also fired well-regarded personnel director Ken Herock, when Herock demanded to be paid in line with his value around the league.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the Wright brothers' design of a controllable <b>airplane</b> <b>that</b> could fly against a strong wind and land on solid ground, Langley sought safety by practicing in calm air over the Potomac River. This required a catapult for launching. The craft had no landing gear, the plan being to descend into the water after demonstrating flight which if successful would entail a partial, if not total, rebuilding of the machine. Langley gave up the project after two crashes on take-off on October 7 and December 8, 1903.|$|E
25|$|Only one {{passenger}} {{would die}} of his injuries after managing {{to escape from}} the burning aircraft. The remaining 25 passengers and two flight attendants were trapped in the wreck as the flames quickly grew too intense to allow any rescue attempts. Firefighters fought the massive blaze for at least 30 minutes before the wreckage could be approached, by which time many of the victims were charred beyond recognition. The Dallas Aviation School and American Magnaflux buildings were almost destroyed and the hangar was extensively damaged. The parked <b>airplane</b> <b>that</b> was struck by the DC-6 burned so extensively that little remained of it afterwards.|$|E

Such a modification was not possible for the Aichi M6A1 Seiran as it could only use the liquid-cooled inverted-vee type engine, as it had to fit the submarine's confined hangar, becoming the only Japanese <b>airplane</b> <b>that</b> retained the inverted-vee engine installation through {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E
50|$|Some early {{airplane}} designers {{attempted to}} make <b>airplanes</b> <b>that</b> were dynamically stable, but {{it was found that}} the requirements for stability conflicted with those for satisfactory flying qualities.
