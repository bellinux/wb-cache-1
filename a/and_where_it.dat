5|$|A {{habitat is}} an {{ecological}} or environmental {{area that is}} inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.|$|E
5|$|ECTunes is {{developing}} a system that utilizes directional sound equipment to emit noise when <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is needed. According to the company, its technology sends audible signals only {{in the direction of}} travel, thus allowing the vehicle to be heard by those who may be in the car's path, without disturbing others with unwelcome noise. Insero Horsens, a Danish venture company, has provided a significant investment to help ECTunes fully develop its technology.|$|E
5|$|A {{radiographic}} evaluation {{using an}} X-ray, CT scan, or MRI can {{determine if there}} is damage to the spinal column <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is located. X-rays are commonly available and can detect instability or misalignment of the spinal column, but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to the spinal cord or displacement of ligaments or disks {{that do not have}} accompanying spinal column damage. Thus when X-ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due to pain or SCI symptoms, CT or MRI scans are used. CT gives greater detail than X-rays, but exposes the patient to more radiation, and it still does not give images of the spinal cord or ligaments; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail. Thus it is the standard for anyone who has neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have an unstable spinal column injury.|$|E

5|$|Carter gave 90 {{pages of}} the {{screenplay}} to Fox who received it well. While not officially greenlighted, he got a budget from Fox and began to make plans as to when <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> would be filmed. Carter then enlisted Daniel Sackheim as a producer on the film. Sackheim had previously produced the pilot episode of The X-Files and directed several episodes {{in the first two}} seasons. The X-Files marked his first contribution as producer to a feature film. Carter's choice for director was Rob Bowman, who had been the series' executive producer and a director before the production base was moved from Vancouver to Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the species}} <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> lives, the larva either conceals itself under leaves, debris or pieces of wood, hides in a crack or digs a funnel-shaped pit in loose material. As ambush predators, {{catching}} prey is risky because food arrives unpredictably and, for those species that make traps, maintaining one is costly; the larvae therefore have low metabolic rates and can survive {{for long periods}} without food. They can take several years to complete their life-cycle; they mature faster with plentiful food, but can survive for many months without feeding. In cooler climates they dig their way deeper and remain inactive during the winter.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the current}} law {{there are two}} {{applications}} of the insanity defence; where it is claimed that the defendant was insane {{at the time that}} he committed the crime, <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is claimed that he was insane at the time of the trial and thus unable to effectively defend himself. The defence is most commonly used in the Crown Court, since it was previously believed that it required a jury; in DPP v Harper , it was decided that the defence could also be applied in the Magistrates' Court.|$|E

The legal system is generally based on English common law, with some distinctions for local circumstances. Each territory has its own attorney general, and court system.

This is particularly important for cases involving serious crimes <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is impossible to find a jury who will not know the defendant in a small population island.|$|E
25|$|Again, in 256BC, {{it was at}} Heraclea {{that the}} Carthaginian fleet of 350 ships was posted {{for the purpose of}} {{preventing}} the passage of the Roman fleet to Africa, <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> sustained a great defeat from the Roman consuls Regulus and Manlius.
