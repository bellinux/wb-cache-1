40|$|This article {{analyses}} the inconsistent approaches {{taken by}} courts when interpreting {{provisions of the}} Corporations Act which address debts or expenses “incurred” by receivers, <b>administrators</b> <b>and</b> <b>liquidators.</b> The article contends for a consistent construction of these provisions which will enable the legislation to operate (as was intended) {{for the benefit of}} persons who supply goods, services or labour to companies in external administration. The article explains how and why debts can be “incurred” by insolvency practitioners continuing on pre-existing contracts. Specifically, the article contends for a construction of ss 419 and 443 A of the Corporations Act which renders receivers and administrators personally liable for certain entitlements of employees (eg, wages and superannuation contributions) which become due and payable by reason of the decision of a receiver or administrator to continue a pre-existing contract rather than terminate it...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} form ISDA Master Agreement {{published by the}} International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) is the pre-eminent market standard contract used by the global derivatives market to document OTC derivative transactions. The recent collapse of Lehman Brothers and other major financial institutions around the world has exposed certain weaknesses in the termination and close-out provisions of the ISDA Master Agreement, especially where the counterparty in a derivative contract becomes insolvent. This article will examine the universal problems faced by insolvency <b>administrators</b> <b>and</b> <b>liquidators</b> globally when trying to terminate and close out ISDA contracts, and recover amounts due to the insolvent counterparty (if any). Experience will be drawn from recent court rulings on these issues in Australia and the United States of America (which had opposing outcomes), {{with a view to}} consider the legal position in Hong Kong and potential endgame solutions for Hong Kong liquidators facing similar difficulties. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|When {{a company}} enters a formal {{insolvency}} procedure its directors {{are more likely}} {{than at any other time}} in the company's existence to face civil and/or criminal actions for breach of duties or obligations imposed on them by company law or other more generally applicable rules such as the Fair Trading Act of 1986. Part of a liquidator's primary duty is to realise the assets of the company, those assets including, of course, causes of action that the company may have against its directors. Additionally, on liquidation, other specified actions that may be taken against company directors accrue to the liquidator. What, if any, action a company is able to take against its directors will form part of the administrator's report sent to creditors of a compay in administration prior to the watershed meeting and may well have an impact on the decision made by the creditors at the watershed meeting. Both an <b>administrator</b> <b>and</b> a <b>liquidator</b> have a duty to notify the Registrar if they suspect directors have committed offences under specified legislation including the Companies Act 1993, the Securities Act 1978 and the Securities Market Act 1978. However, despite the apparent breadth of the title of this paper, I have been asked to focus on two particular aspects of directors' liability on insolvency. The first is the nature, and potential liability arising from breach, of directors' duties on insolvency. The second is the new prohibition on director involvement in phoenix companies in ss 386 A- 286 F of the Companies Act 1993...|$|R

40|$|Corporate {{insolvency}} {{regulation is}} of decisive relevance for banks {{in terms of}} their secure operation and ability to recover outstanding claims from corporate clients. This topic {{has been the subject of}} many debates lately, as Hungarian corporate insolvency regulation has been undergoing reforms since 2003. One of the main objectives in this regard was to adopt new measures to improve the mediation of funds in the economy. This study introduces reviews leading to the reform, demonstrates the measures already adopted and those in the pipeline, and finally offers an assessment of the measures in general and from the perspective of financial stability. Reform measures adopted so far are favourable from the perspective of financial stability, since the international standards which have been introduced improve the secure operation of commercial banks when mediating funds. However, the reform has to be carried on, with special regard to the enhanced creditor protection temporary <b>administrators</b> <b>and</b> <b>liquidators</b> must be enabled to protect the interests of creditors in any situation and creditors should be afforded means to enforce it. insolvency, regulation, capital adequacy, securities, financial stability. ...|$|E

There was a Panel B Scheme but it has now ceased to operate. It is expected, {{as a result of the}} economic impact of the current global financial crisis, that the number of court winding-up cases will continue to rise, and therefore it is imperative to streamline the practices of private-sector provisional <b>liquidators</b> <b>and</b> <b>liquidators</b> <b>and</b> the payment schemes under which they are paid. This article first identifies the different circumstances that call for the appointment of private insolvency practitioners to act as liquidators under the Panel A Scheme, <b>and</b> as provisional <b>liquidators</b> <b>and</b> / or <b>liquidators</b> under the Panel T Scheme. Then, this article will examine whether the percentage basis or the time-cost basis shall be used as the default to determine their fees and remuneration. Finally, the shortfall met out by the government subsidy is available currently for the Panel T Scheme only, not the Panel A Scheme. Whether such subsidy should be removed by cross-subsidising Panel A and Panel T Scheme cases or whether a “cab rank” system should be introduced will also be examined. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
