The analysis of the spatial variability of soil <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> provides both agronomic and environmentally useful information. However, extensive measurements of soil <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> remain tedious and expensive. This study explores two different approaches as alternative to measurements of soil <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability.</b> One approach estimated <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> via laboratory measurements of soil elementary properties using multiple linear regressions known as pedotransfer functions. The second approach, which is methodologically innovating, was based on the geological pattern as a proxy for <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> using regression-kriging analysis. A set of 113 soil samples from an 800 km² agricultural region that included the Lebna watershed (Cap Bon, Tunisia) were collected from the soil surface layer (0 - 10 cm depth). Samples were analyzed for elementary properties (i. e., soil texture, total carbon and nitrogen, iron, CaCO 3, salinity, CEC and pH) and for soil <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> according to the normalized method (ISO/DIS 10930, 2012), which considers three indexes (MWD) calculated for three contrasted wetting conditions and disruptive energies. Most soils in the study area were non-salted with an alkaline pH and relatively low organic carbon content. Of the soils, 35 % were clay soils, and 55 % had a balanced soil texture. The average of the three soil <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> indexes (MWDmean) ranged from 0. 38 to 2. 80 mm, and this property showed large variability from instable soils to very stable ones. Analysis of pedotransfer functions determined that the best predictor variables for soil <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> were silt, organic matter and iron. Geostatistical analyses at the regional scale showed spatially structured soil <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> (variograms with sills reaching a 5 km distance). Using geological information as ancillary data, the prediction of soil <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> with regression-kriging was similar to that of pedotransfer functions.

The objectives of this paper are to evaluate soil <b>aggregates</b> <b>stability</b> and to determine the relationship between SOC and soil aggregate stability. Soil samples at 0 - 20 cm layer were adopted from a long-term (16 yr) field experiment including conventional tillage: plain culture, summer rice crop and winter upland crop under drained conditions (PUR-r), and conservation tillage: ridge culture without tillage, summer rice and winter fallow with floodwater layer annually (NTR-f), and winter upland crop under drained conditions (NTR-r), and wide ridge culture without tillage, summer rice crop and winter upland crop under conditions (NTRw-r), respectively. The determination of aggregate-size stability distribution involves the assumptions that soil aggregates can be categorized {{in terms of their}} size and water stability (slaking resistance). Experimentally this procedure involves the slaked and capillary-wetted pretreatments; and a subsequent slaking treatment of aggregates > 0. 250 mm in size. WSMA and NMWD were applied to simulate the breakdown mechanisms of aggregates for studying soil stability based on aggregate resistance to slaking in paddy soil. The results showed that the amount of aggregates-size was greatly observed in the fraction of 2 ~ 6. 72 mm under ridge culture in paddy soil (more than 50 %) under slaking and capillary-wetting pretreatment. The proportion of soil macro-aggregates (> 0. 25 mm) in conservation tillage was greatly higher than that in conventional tillage under subsequent slaking treatment. Minimal differences of aggregate stability between slaking and wetting were observed, while {{significant differences were found between}} ridge culture and plain culture. The <b>aggregates</b> <b>stability</b> under slaking treatment ranked in the order of NTR-r>NTRw-r>NTR-f>PUR-r, while under wetting was NTRw-r>NTR-r>NTR-f>PUR-r, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the <b>aggregates</b> <b>stability</b> and SOC concentrations under wetting, and low correlation was observed under slaking pretreatment. Soil exposure with tillage and lack of rice/rape-seed stubble inputs caused declines in aggregation and organic carbon, both of which make soil susceptible to water erosion.

The availability of nutrients directly influenced the quality of nutrient losses, but did not influence the quantity of nutrients lost. K, Mg and Ca were the most susceptible element to the water abrasion (> 85 % of their total loss was due to water abrasion). Instead for C, N, and partly P, important loss occurred because of the water saturation alone and their losses were related to the aggregates ruptures due to fast wetting (r= 0. 98, 0. 99 and 0. 81, respectively). These findings suggest a high vulnerability to soil fertility losses, and that a great depletion can occur even because of rainfall of low intensity, but sufficient to water saturated the topsoil.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the effects of repeated field applications of three urban compost amendments and one farmyard manure amendment over a 9 -year period on <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> in a silty loam soil initially characterized by low clay and initial organic matter contents and poor <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability.</b> Three different <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> tests with increasing disruptive intensities (fast wetting > mechanical breakdown > slow wetting tests) and different disaggregation mechanisms, were used. All of the amendments, which were applied at approximately 4 Mg C ha(- 1) every other year, increased the organic carbon content and improved the <b>stability</b> of the <b>aggregates</b> against the disruptive action of water, as determined by each of the stability tests. However, the year-to-year variations in the <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> that related to factors other than the organic inputs were greater than the cumulative increase in <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> relative to the control. The positive effects of the tested amendments on <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> were linked to their contribution to soil organic C contents (r= 0. 54 for the fast wetting test and r = 0. 41 - 0. 42 for the mechanical breakdown and slow wetting tests; p < 0. 05). The addition of urban composts had a larger positive effect on <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> than farmyard manure at the majority of sampling dates. The addition of biodegradable immature compost, such as municipal solid waste (MSW), improved the <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> through an enhanced resistance to slaking. The addition of mature composts, such as the co-compost of sewage sludge and green wastes (GWS) or biowaste compost (BW), improved the <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> by increasing interparticular cohesion. The MSW compost was the most efficient in improving <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> during the first 6 years of the experiment (average improvements of + 22 %, + 5 % and + 28 % in the fast wetting, mechanical breakdown and slow wetting tests, respectively, compared to the control treatment); this result was likely due to the larger labile organic pool of the MSW compost that was highly effective at stimulating soil microbial activity. After the first 6 years, the two other composts, GWS and BW, became more efficient (average improvements of + 25 %, + 61 % and + 33 % in the fast wetting, mechanical breakdown and slow wetting tests, respectively, compared to the control treatment), which was probably linked to the greater increase in soil organic C contents. Therefore, the application of urban compost to silty soil that is susceptible to water erosion was effective at improving <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> and thus could be used to enhance the resistance of soil to water erosion...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{particle}} interactions are {{strongly influenced by}} the concentration, valence and ion species and the pH of the bulk solution, which will also affect <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> and parti-cle transport. In this study, we investigated clay <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> {{in the presence of}} dif-ferent alkali ions (Li+, Na+, K+, and Cs+) at concentrations from 10 − 5 to 10 − 1 mol L− 1. Strong specific ion effects on clay <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> were observed, and showed the order Cs+>K+>Na+>Li+. We found that it was not the effects of ion size, hydration, and disper-sion forces in the cation–surface interactions but strong non-classic polarization of ad-sorbed cations that resulted in these specific effects. In this study, the non-classic dipole moments of each cation species resulting from the non-classic polarization were estimat-ed. By comparing non-classic dipole moments with classic values, the observed dipole moments of adsorbed cations were up to 104 times larger than the classic values for the same cation. The observed non-classic dipole moments sharply increased with decreas-ing electrolyte concentration. We conclude that strong non-classic polarization could sig-nificantly suppress the thickness of the diffuse layer, thereby weakening the electric field near the clay surface and resulting in improved clay <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability.</b> Even though we only demonstrated specific ion effects on <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> with several alkali ions, our results indicate that these effects could be universally important in soil <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability...</b>|$|R

The objectives {{of this work}} were to evaluate and to compare the physical attributes of a typic distroferric Red Latosol under Eucalyptus cloeziana, E. grandis, E. Pilularis and Corymbia maculata coverage, 37 years after being planted at the Federal University of Lavras campus. The soil profiles were sampled down to 1 m depth in order to analyze their particle-size distribution, porosity, structure and water retention. The results were submitted to analysis of variance, Scott-Knott multiple means comparison test, correlations and linear regression. The profiles presented appropriated soil physical conditions to provide good plant development. The bulk density and microporosity increased in depth while the total pore volume, macroporosity and <b>aggregates</b> <b>stability</b> decreased in depth.

The mapping of an agroforestry growing area of 70 × 70 m was made using a regular grid sampling of 10 × 10 m. In each grid, soil samples were collected at 0. 0 - 0. 2 and 0, 40 - 0, 60 m depth, {{with a total of}} 128 sample points. Physical analyses were made (texture, soil bulk and particles density, macro and microporosity, total porosity and <b>aggregates</b> <b>stability</b> in water). With the exception of DMG, DMP and class aggregates < 1. 00 mm had all the physical attributes spatial dependence structure ranging from moderate to weak. Values were above the range established in the mesh (12. 00 to 45. 56 m), enabling to make a basis for future studies in forest area. The physical attributes presented in kriging maps different spatial behavior, however there are relationships between these attributes shown by geostatistics proving that this is effective tool for studies in forest area...|$|E
40|$|This paper gives {{a glance}} about the {{conservation}} agriculture concept and the worldwide increase in agricultural area where this technique has been adopted. The main constraints to agricultural {{production in the}} Mediterranean region are discussed, highlighting the importance of conservation agriculture to mitigate them. Results of long-term studies with this technique, in Portugal, showed an increase in organic matter, improvement of <b>aggregates</b> <b>stability</b> and continuity of biological porosity along the soil profile. These changes in soil properties are helping to overcome edaphic and climatic constrains under Mediterranean conditions. The saturated hydraulic conductivity is improved allowing a better drainage during wet winters, and together with higher soil cohesion, the transitability of the soil is enhanced, allowing a correct timing of field operations like nitrogen top dressing and herbicide application. Nitrogen-use efficiency is improved either by the timing of application and by the improvement of soil organic matter content. Soil productivity is also enhanced and the overall energy-use efficiency is double when soil organic matter content is raised from 1 to 2 % in the top 30 cm of the soil. Therefore, conservation agriculture is advantageous from the economic and environmental point of view contributing to the sustainability of rainfed agricultur...|$|E
40|$|Dry <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> is an {{important}} soil physical property for evaluating tillage and wind-erosion research. Research {{in this study was}} aimed at developing a model for predicting soil <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> as influenced by intrinsic soil properties, with particular application to wind erosion. Aggregates from 10 Kansas soils with a wide textural range were tested periodically for stability during a 3 -yr period. The logarithm of <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> was regressed against the intrinsic soil properties (geometric mean diameter of primary particles, specific surface area, water content at- 1500 J/kg matric potential, and clay content). Clay content and water content at- 1500 J/kg were both good predictors of mean <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability.</b> A resulting empirical model estimates mean <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> from either clay or water content with coefficients of determination of 0. 97 and 0. 96, respec-tively. Further testing is planned by running the model with several independent data sets to estimate the probability of <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> within specified limits for particular soils. IND-EROSION RESEARCH SCIENTISTS have been W charged with developing improved wind-ero-sion prediction technology as a possible replacement for the wind-erosion equation (Hagen, 1991 a).

We investigated soil organic C (SOC), water-soluble organic C (WSOC), easily oxidizable organic C (EOC), humic C fractions, aggregate-associated C, <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability,</b> and humic acid (HA) composition along an east-west transect across Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and explored their spatial patterns and controlling factors. The contents of SOC, WSOC, EOC, humic C fractions and aggregate-associated C, the proportions of macro-aggregates (2 - 0. 25) and micro-aggregates (0. 25 - 0. 053 mm), and the <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> indices all increased in the order alpine desert < alpine steppe < alpine meadow. The alkyl C, O-alkyl C, and aliphatic C/aromatic C ratio of HA increased as alpine desert < alpine meadow < alpine steppe, and the trends were reverse for the aromatic C and HB/HI ratio. Mean annual precipitation and aboveground biomass were significantly correlated with the contents of SOC and its fractions, the proportions of macro- and micro-aggregates, and the <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> indices along this transect. Among all these C fractions, SOC content and <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> were more closely associated with humic C and silt and clay sized C in comparison with WSOC, EOC, and macro- and micro-aggregate C. The results suggested that alpine meadow soils containing higher SOC exhibited high soil aggregation and <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability.</b> Mean annual precipitation should be the main climate factor controlling the spatial patterns of SOC, soil aggregation, and <b>aggregate</b> <b>stability</b> in this region.
