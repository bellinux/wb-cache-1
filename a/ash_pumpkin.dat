To obtain that golden <b>ash</b> <b>pumpkin</b> he married a village girl from that area and gave a birth to a son. When the {{suitable}} time is reached, he scarified his son and obtained the pumpkin. While running with it, he kept the pumpkin on a rocky plain to get little rest. It is said that the golden <b>ash</b> <b>pumpkin</b> was dipped into the rock. Due to this incident, the area was known as Pusulpitiya and {{it is believed that}} the Pusulpitiya Rajamaha Vihara was constructed on the ground where the Golden <b>ash</b> <b>pumpkin</b> was dipped into the rock.|$|E
5000|$|Every Wednesday and Saturday is {{market day}} {{for people of}} Elavumthitta. In olden days the economy of Elavumthitta was closely related with {{agriculture}} produce. There was no rubber plantation then. People cultivated mainly paddy in wet land; dry land was used for growing Coconut palm, cashew trees, Tapioca, Pepper, gram, horse gram, green gram, red gram, filler millet, pineapple, mango, Plantain, bitter gourd, snake gourd, <b>ash</b> <b>pumpkin,</b> Pumpkin, lady's finger, chilies, drumstick, yam [...] The foot hills had plenty of water shed fertile land; anything sown gave a rich return. Poor man's staple food was Tapioca and sea fish. The weekly market was not only for selling and buying, it was a meeting ground and a venue for the local people to exchange pleasantries. Market day was a reference point for the local people in their conversation. Schedule of important assignments were changed or shifted or postponed taking the market day into account. Market was also a venue for the young to develop familiarity with opposite sex and that in course of time develops into intimacy and then culminated in marriage.|$|E

40|$|Invasive {{species have}} the {{capability}} to alter landscapes and change the composition of a forest in a very short time. The recent invasive pest, Agrilus planipennis, emerald ash borer, was unintentionally introduced to the United States via ship route to Michigan. The pest attacks and kills all five native ash species in Ohio. This study focused on an area in west central Ohio not yet affected by the borer. Ash centered plots were used to record all species and sizes (diameter at breast height) within a 5 m radius of a central ash tree. Plots ranged in topography and all five ash species were sampled. Moisture contents were calculated for each plot based on topographical variables in ArcGIS. My objectives were to answer the following questions: What species will replace ash and how do replacement species vary among different ashes and with topography? Also, how does the understory composition vary among ash species as related to topography? Results suggest that sugar maple will be the likely successor of ash species. Sugar maple was the most important species in all plots and under all ash species except for the black and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>ash</b> which were associated with hydric species. American elm was highly associated with both white and blue ash. A moisture index (IMI) showed a significant separation of black and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>ash,</b> found in swampy regions, from the other three <b>ashes.</b> Black and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>ashes</b> were found in the wettest sites followed by blue, green, and white ash. Detrended correspondence analysis found the five ash species to segregate in a two-dimensional space based on a moisture gradient. Significant correlations were found between the ordination scores and both the size of the central tree and the nearest neighbor indicating a possible succession gradient as well. Post emerald ash borer trends appear to be toward a forest dominated by maples and possibly elms...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{trees in the}} swamp are Red Maple, Pin Oak, Shagbark Hickory, Shellbark Hickory, Swamp White Oak, American Elm and sweetgum. Culberson woods also {{contains}} tree species unusual for the Till Plains, such as <b>Pumpkin</b> <b>Ash</b> and Winterberry. Summer flowers include purple fringeless orchid and cardinal flower.|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in global trade {{beginning in the early}} 20 th century has led to the inadvertent introduction of many non-native fungal, animal, insect, and plant species into the United States. These introductions, released from their native predators or pathogens, can quickly and severely impact the pre-existing flora and fauna. The emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire; Coleoptera:Buprestidae) is an exotic obligate insect pest of ash trees, genus Fraxinus. Since its first detection in Michigan in 2002, millions of ash trees have been killed. With little innate resistance in North American ash populations, the EAB continues to spread. <b>Pumpkin</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus profunda) is a fine hardwood species integral to wetland communities where it is predominantly found. Because of its narrow habitat requirements, the threat of extirpation is further exacerbated by EAB, and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>ash</b> has been listed as threatened or endangered in a number of states. To mitigate this threat, the objective of this research was to develop an in vitro adventitious regeneration and transformation system that would allow for genetic modification of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>ash</b> for EAB resistance. ^ Hypocotyls isolated from mature <b>pumpkin</b> <b>ash</b> seed were used as the initial explants for developing an in vitro regeneration protocol. Aseptically cultured hypocotyls produced adventitious shoots at a 43 % frequency when cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with Gamborg B 5 vitamins plus 0. 2 g l - 1 glycine (B 5 G), and supplemented with 22. 2 μM benzyladenine (BA) in combination with 4. 5 μM thidiazuron (TDZ). Shoots were elongated on MS medium containing 10 μM BA and 10 μM TDZ. When exposed to woody plant medium (WPM) supplemented with 4. 9 μM indole- 3 -butryic acid (IBA) <b>pumpkin</b> <b>ash</b> microshoots readily formed adventitious roots. Newly formed plantlets were then successfully acclimatized to ambient greenhouse conditions. ^ Once this in vitro regeneration system was completed, {{the next step was to}} develop a genetic transformation protocol. Utilizing an Agrobacterium -mediated transformation system, a designed vector (pq 35 GR) containing the β-glucuronidase (GUS), green florescent protein (GFP), and neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII) genes, was incorporated into the genome of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>ash.</b> These transgenes permitted the visualization and selection of transgenic adventitious shoots. Hypocotyls were exposed to a suspension of Agrobacterium tumefacians (At) strain EHA 105 carrying the pq 35 GR vector. At was introduced by vacuum-infiltration for 10 min after 90 s sonication, and then co-cultured with hypocotyls in the dark for 3 d, after which the hypocotyls transferred to selection medium. Transformed hypocotyls were selected and adventitious shoots regenerated on MS medium supplemented with 22. 2 µM BA, 4. 5 μM TDZ, 50 mg l - 1 adenine hemisulfate (AS), 10 % coconut water (CW), 400 mg l - 1 timentin, and 20 mg l- 1 kanamycin. A replicated factorial experiment showed 400 mg l- 1 timentin, and 20 mg l- 1 kanamycin to be optimal for controlling Agrobacterium growth and selecting transgenic plant material, respectively. Transformation was confirmed through polymerase chain reaction and GFP visualization. The development of this successful regeneration and transformation protocol will allow for the incorporation of genes imparting resistance to EAB, and provides an additional tool for managers who wish to keep <b>pumpkin</b> <b>ash</b> in the native landscape. ...|$|R

40|$|Key message This {{transformation}} and regeneration protocol provides an integral {{framework for the}} genetic improvement of Fraxinus profunda (<b>pumpkin</b> <b>ash)</b> for future development of plants resistant to the emerald ash borer. Abstract Using mature hypocotyls as the initial explants, an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transfor-mation system was successfully developed for <b>pumpkin</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus profunda). This transformation protocol is an invaluable tool to combat the highly aggressive, non-native emerald ash borer (EAB), which {{has the potential to}} eliminate native Fraxinus spp. from the natural landscape. Hypocotyls were successfully transformed with Agrobac-terium strain EHA 105 harboring the pq 35 GR vector, con-taining an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as well as a fusion gene between neomycin phosphotransfer-ase (nptII) and gusA. Hypocotyls were cultured for 7 days on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 22. 2 lM 6 -benzyladenine (BA), 4. 5 lM thidiazuron (TDZ), 50 mg L- 1 adenine hemisulfate (AS), and 10 % coconut water (CW) prior to transformation. Hypocotyls were transformed using 90 s sonication plus 10 min vacuum infiltration after Agrobacterium was exposed to 100 lM acetosyringone for 1 h. Adventitious shoots were regener-ated on MS medium with 22. 2 lM BA, 4. 5 lM TDZ, 50 mg L- 1 AS, 10 % CW, 400 mg L- 1 timentin, and 20 mg L- 1 kanamycin. Timentin at 400 and 20 mg L- 1 kanamycin were most effective at controlling Agrobacte-rium growth and selecting for transformed cells, respec-tively. The presence of nptII, GUS (b-glucuronidase), and EGFP in transformed plants was confirmed using poly-merase chain reaction (PCR), while the expression of EGFP was also confirmed through fluorescent microscopy and reverse transcription-PCR. This transformation proto-col provides an integral foundation for future genetic modifications of F. profunda to provide resistance to EAB...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this work}} is to analyse the effect of {{convective}} drying on the nutritional properties of fresh and dried pumpkin (Cucurbita máxima). The samples were analyzed in terms of moisture content, total and reducing sugars, acidity, proteins, lipids, crude fiber and <b>ash.</b> The <b>pumpkin</b> was cut into circular slices dried in a ventilated chamber at different temperatures, ranging between 30 ºC and 70 ºC. In addition, the kinetic behaviour was also studied in this temperature band. The results enable us {{to conclude that the}} fresh pumpkin has a low content of lipids and a high level of water, sugars, protein and crude fiber. This chemical composition, which is an excellent source of nutritive elements, associated with some components with antioxidant activity, which act as a health-protecting factor, make out of pumpkin an excellent food product, whose consumption should be further encouraged. In addition, it is also possible to conclude that, apparently, the convective drying process has no effect on the nutritional characteristics of the pumpkin, except on sugars and acidity. The influence of the operating condition (the temperature) on the drying kinetics was also analysed. The results show that the increase on the operating temperature strongly accelerates the drying process and a constant rate period is not observed. However, in the range of 30 to 70 ºC it was observed that there is a similar kinetic behaviour for all the values of temperature tested. The experimental data for the moisture ratio content with time was fitted, using the software Sigma Plot, v 8. 0 (SPSS, Inc.), to eight different models, and the two that showed a better performance were the Page and modifie...|$|R
