40|$|Background: The fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> is a {{new device}} that has been {{designed}} {{with the intention of}} improving anchorage-to-bone strength during tendon-to-bone repair in patients with compromised bone quality. In this in vitro study we compare the load-to-failure and mode-of-failure results of a fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> to that of other devices that are commonly used during rotator cuff repair surgery, including: a buttress <b>plate,</b> metal suture <b>anchors,</b> bioabsorbable suture anchors, and suture through simple tunnels without any augmenting device. We hypothesized that the fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> would provide higher load-to-failure measurements compared to the other devices. Methods: Each device was implanted into solid rigid polyurethane foam blocks with densities representing varying degrees of osteoporosis, and then tested to failure. ANOVA and post-hoc analysis tests were used to determine statistical significance. Results: The average load to failure for the fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> was significantly greater in low and medium density blocks compared to the other devices tested (p≤ 0. 01). The greatest difference in magnitude was seen in low density blocks (5 pcf), where the fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> failed at 278 ± 53 N (mean ± standard deviation), about double the value of the next highest failure at 133 ± 11 N for the buttress plate. Conclusions: The fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> demonstrated superior anchorage strength in low and medium density foam blocks compared to the other devices that were tested in this study.

40|$|The {{vertical}} pullout {{capacity of}} strip and circular <b>plate</b> <b>anchors</b> embedded horizontally in a layered sandy medium was computed {{by using the}} plane strain and axisymmetric lower-bound limit analyses in combination with finite elements and linear optimization. The soil medium below the <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> {{was assumed to be}} comprised of loose sand. Two different sand layers were considered above the anchor with different combinations of their internal friction angles. For several embedment ratios (H/B), the variations of the pullout factors F-gamma and F-q due to the components of soil unit weight and surcharge, respectively, were computed as a function of H-dense/H for different cases; here, H and H-dense imply (1) the depth of the <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> from ground surface and (2) the thickness of the dense sand layer, respectively. The pullout resistance increased continuously with an increase in H-dense/H. For a given H/B, with the same value of H-dense/H, the uplift resistance became greater for a case when the dense sand layer was kept just above the plate rather than placing it close to ground surface. Compared with strip anchors, the uplift factors became considerably greater for circular anchors. The effect of the variation of the unit weights of the two layers above the <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> on its pullout resistance was also explored.

40|$|Rock bolts ensure {{structural}} stability for tunnels {{and many other}} underground structures. The pre-load on a rock bolt {{plays an important role}} in the structural reinforcement and it is vital to monitor the pre-load status of rock bolts. In this paper, a rock bolt pre-load monitoring method based on the piezoceramic enabled time reversal method is proposed. A lead zirconate titanate (PZT) patch transducer, which works as an actuator to generate stress waves, is bonded onto the <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> of the rock bolt. A smart washer, which is fabricated by sandwiching a PZT patch between two metal rings, is installed between the hex nut and the <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> along the rock bolt. The smart washer functions as a sensor to detect the stress wave. With the increase of the pre-load values on the rock bolt, the effective contact surface area between the smart washer and the <b>anchor</b> <b>plate,</b> benefiting the stress wave propagation crossing the contact surface. With the help of time reversal technique, experimental results reveal that the magnitude of focused signal clearly increases with the increase of the pre-load on a rock bolt before the saturation which happens beyond a relatively high value of the pre-load. The proposed method provides an innovative and real time means to monitor the pre-load level of a rock bolt. By employing this method, the pre-load degradation process on a rock bolt can be clearly monitored. Please note that, currently, the proposed method applies to only new rock bolts, on which it is possible to install the PZT smart washer...|$|R
