25|$|Warner {{began the}} 2002 {{season as the}} Rams' starter, but he played poorly, {{throwing}} seven interceptions against only one touchdown as the team went 0–3. In the Rams' fourth game, this one against the Dallas Cowboys, Warner broke <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> his throwing hand. Warner attempted to come back later in the season, but his injury allowed him to play only two more games (both losses). In contrast to his 103.0 career passer rating entering the season, Warner posted a minuscule 67.4 rating in 2002.|$|E

An autopsy revealed that, {{in addition to having}} been sexually violated, she had died of strangulation after receiving extensive blunt-force trauma to the face, head, breasts, and left elbow, with her olecranon sustaining multiple fractures. Her genitalia and rectum had been torn, caused in part by Bittaker having inserted pliers inside her body. In addition, her left hand bore a puncture wound and <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> her right hand had been slashed.|$|E
25|$|On the 49ers' next drive, Montana {{called a}} pass play on third down. With the New York defense {{covering}} {{all of his}} receivers, Montana was forced to move outside the pocket to make a play. Lawrence Taylor was the first Giant {{to try to bring}} Montana down, with Leonard Marshall trailing the play after getting up from a Tom Rathman block earlier in the sequence. Taylor swiped at Montana but missed, only briefly holding him up. Marshall, charging from Montana's blind side, was {{able to take advantage of}} the slowing of the quarterback's momentum and drilled him hard in the back. Montana was already suffering from a lingering back injury and Marshall's hit broke <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> his throwing hand and gave him a severe concussion, as Montana struggled to stand for the remainder of the game. The 49ers almost turned the ball over as Marshall's hit caused a fumble, but the ball skipped past Giants cornerback Mark Collins and lineman Steve Wallace recovered enabling the 49ers to punt.|$|E
25|$|Doug Wright {{was seen}} as England's trump card {{when he arrived in}} Australia, but he was either the unluckiest or the most over-rated spinner to tour Australia. Don Bradman said he was the best leg-spinner to tour Australia since Sydney Barnes 35 years before, and Keith Miller thought he was the best leg-spinner he knew after Bill O'Reilly. After Tich Freeman retired Wright became Kent's main spinner, taking 2,056 wickets (23.98) and a record seven first class hat-tricks. His long rollicking run up and brisk pace gave away many no-balls and too often he served up full tosses and long hops, but he turned the ball {{fiercely}} and his googly had even the best batsmen groping. His ability to run through a side made him the terror of the County circuit, but he rarely achieved this in Tests. In the Fifth Test at Sydney his 7/105 dismissed Australia for 253 and in 1947 his 10/175 in the Second Test gave England a 10 wicket victory over South Africa. His great asset was that he always looked as if he was about to take a wicket, but in Australia in 1946–47 and again in 1950–51 he proved too expensive and like Bedser was overbowled. Their second leg-spinner was Peter Smith, who was preferred to Eric Hollies because of his batting, but he injured <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> the journey to Australia and had an appendix removed once there. Even so, he was effective in tour matches - his 9/121 against NSW is the best bowling return by an Englishman in Australia - but was understandably below par in his only Test. James Langridge was a veteran Slow Left Arm bowler who started his trade in 1924, and had taken 92 wickets (22.11) in 1946, but he was 41 years old on his first tour of Australia and just when he appeared to be finding his form he strained a muscle and could not play. Jack Ikin was a part-time leg-spinner whose bowling was thought to be of all round status early in his career (helped by the very poor wickets at Old Trafford), but Hammond used him rarely and he proved to be expensive in the Tests.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, McCartney {{played a}} concert in Red Square, Russia. Vladimir Putin gave the couple {{a tour of the}} Kremlin. McCartney later said that Mills's {{contribution}} was giving him an acrylic fingernail to protect <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> his left hand that often bled after playing guitar. McCartney admitted that Mills inspired him, as [...] "Being in love with her makes me want to write songs", such as [...] "Too Much Rain" [...] on Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, and [...] "See Your Sunshine" [...] ("She makes me feel glad/I want her so bad") from Memory Almost Full. Another composition inspired by Mills was used as the bridal march at their wedding.|$|E

[...] Calling the result [...] "a seething terror ridden pulp", Sounds elaborated: [...] "How have [...] produced a record more powerful than Lydon/Bambaataa's [...] "World Destruction" [...] without laying <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> a synthesiser or guitar? THEFT! By stealing all the various beats, noises and sounds they've wanted, and building it into their own stunning audio collage, [...] are making a direct assault on the way records are put together." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{spent the}} 1908 season {{splitting}} {{time at the}} catcher position with Bemis, as both struggled in spring practice. In September, Clarke sustained an injury {{in a game against}} Detroit when the bone of <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> his right hand was split and he was unable to grow a nail. On October 2, he caught a perfect game thrown by Addie Joss, which was only the fourth perfect game in MLB history. He finished the year with a [...]241 batting average and six triples in 97 games. On Thanksgiving night in 1908, Clarke was married to Mary A. Smith at the home of the bride's parents in Sandwich, Ontario, Canada. His wife did not like the [...] "Nig" [...] nickname that sports reporters used, and wanted them to simply call him Jay in newspapers.|$|E

500|$|Bart, {{and other}} The Simpsons characters, have {{appeared}} in numerous television commercials for Nestlé's Butterfinger candy bars from 1990 to 2001, with the slogan [...] "Nobody better lay <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> my Butterfinger!" [...] Lisa would occasionally advertise it too. Matt Groening would later say that the Butterfinger advertising campaign was {{a large part of}} the reason why Fox decided to pick up the half-hour show. The campaign was discontinued in 2001, much to the disappointment of Cartwright. Bart has also appeared in commercials for Burger King and Ramada Inn. In 2001, Kellogg's launched a brand of cereal called [...] "Bart Simpson Peanut Butter Chocolate Crunch", which was available for a limited time. Before the half-hour series went on the air, Matt Groening pitched Bart as a spokesperson for Jell-O. He wanted Bart to sing [...] "J-E-L-L-O", then burp the letter O. His belief was that kids would try to do it the next day, but he was rejected.|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to rebel from his father, Peter decides {{to reach for the}} freezer to take out some ice cream during dinner, much to the chagrin of Tom Tucker, who {{attempts}} to stop him. As Peter lifts a spoon of ice cream to his mouth, he is warned by Tucker several times not to eat it. When he does, however, Tucker repeatedly spanks him, in reference to the 1979 drama feature Kramer vs. Kramer (even though the spanking does not occur in the movie). After author Gore Vidal appears at the radio station Brian had invited him to speak at, Vidal quickly leaves after he finds the show to be low-brow. This causes Brian to quit the show, noting that he has become [...] "worse of a sell-out" [...] than when Stewie appeared in a Butterfinger commercial. Stewie is then shown eating a Butterfinger, and says [...] "Nobody better lay <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> my Butterfinger", which is a parody of the many Butterfinger commercials featuring Bart Simpson, and utters the annoyed grunt, D'oh!, a phrase used regularly by The Simpsons character Homer Simpson. The bit is also a reference to the negative criticism and similarities between Family Guy and The Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|Blek is {{a puzzle}} {{game in which}} the player draws a [...] "snake-like" [...] black line on the screen that is {{recorded}} and played back like a pattern, recurring repeatedly across the screen. The object is {{to draw a line}} that it will remove colored dot targets when it repeats across the screen without hitting a black dot. Lines that travel off the top or bottom of the screen reset the level, while lines that travel off the left or right of the screen reflect back towards the dots. Aside from repeating the player's drawn pattern, the stroke mimics the player's pace in drawing the stroke. The game begins with no prompt or tutorial other than to use <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> the screen and experiment. The first puzzles are [...] "on open, white canvasses" [...] where the player can solve the simple puzzles [...] "by accident". The 80 levels progress in difficulty and require more complex solutions. Added elements include a [...] "chain reaction" [...] dot that launches other dots when struck. Its sound consists of a [...] "whoosh" [...] that accompanies the traveling stroke, a [...] "chime" [...] when colored dots are hit, and a human [...] "disappointed grumble" [...] when black dots are hit, resetting the level. The game is depicted in flat, plain colors, with no pause feature and no option menu other than Game Center achievements. Players navigate between puzzles using three small onscreen icons. There are no in-app purchases or in-game advertisements.|$|E

500|$|Bartholomew JoJo [...] "Bart" [...] Simpson, {{voiced by}} Nancy Cartwright, is the eldest child and only {{son in the}} family—at age 10. Bart's most {{prominent}} character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness, disrespect for authority and sharp wit. During the first two seasons of The Simpsons, Bart was the show's main character. The name [...] "Bart" [...] is an anagram of the word [...] "brat". Groening conceived Bart as an extreme version of the typical misbehaving child character, merging all of the extreme traits of characters such as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn into one person. Groening's older brother Mark provided most of the inspiration for Bart. Bart's catchphrase [...] "Eat My Shorts" [...] was an ad-lib by Cartwright {{in one of the}} original table readings, harking back to an incident when she was at college. In 1998, Time magazine selected Bart as 46th of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century, and the only fictional character to make the list. He had previously appeared {{on the cover of the}} December 31, 1990 edition. Bart is rebellious and frequently escapes without punishment, which lead some parents' groups and conservative spokespeople to believe he provided a poor role model for children. This prompted George H. W. Bush to rally, [...] "We're going to keep trying to strengthen the American family. To make them more like the Waltons and less like the Simpsons." [...] Bart, and other Simpsons characters, have appeared in numerous television commercials for Nestlé's Butterfinger candy bars from 1990–2001, with the slogan [...] "Nobody better lay <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> my Butterfinger!" ...|$|E

He is also missing <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> his left hand, though the story of how he lost it changes each time he tells it.

2500|$|During {{his studies}} with Wieck, {{it has been}} claimed that Schumann {{permanently}} injured <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> his right hand. Wieck claimed that Schumann damaged his finger {{by the use of}} a mechanical device designed to strengthen the weakest fingers, a device which held back one finger while he exercised the others. This claim has been discredited by Clara Schumann, who said that the disability was not due to a mechanical device, and Robert Schumann himself refers to it as [...] "an affliction of the whole hand". Some have argued that, as the disability appeared to have been chronic and have affected the hand, and not just a finger, it was unlikely to have been caused by a finger strengthening device.|$|E
5000|$|Playing an open string {{simultaneously}} with a stopped note on an adjacent string produces a bagpipe-like drone, often used by composers {{in imitation of}} folk music.
