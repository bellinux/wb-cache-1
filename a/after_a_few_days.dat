5|$|In 1963 forty four prisoners escaped in a well-planned break-out, {{but most}} were quickly recaptured, {{handicapped}} by their weakened physical condition. In 1969 a guard helped {{two members of the}} royal family escape, but they were caught <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> The prison was closed in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{eggs are}} {{incubated}} by the female for 14–15 days to hatching. Chicks are fed initially by the male, both parents sharing the duty <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> when the female {{does not need}} to brood so often, and they fledge in a further 14–15 days.

5|$|Tolerance to {{psilocybin}} builds and dissipates quickly; ingesting psilocybin {{more than}} {{about once a week}} can lead to diminished effects. Tolerance dissipates <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> so doses can be spaced several days apart to avoid the effect. A cross-tolerance can develop between psilocybin and the pharmacologically similar LSD, and between psilocybin and phenethylamines such as mescaline and DOM.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, {{the group}} {{stumbled}} into a Miwok camp looking so deteriorated that the camp's inhabitants initially fled. The Miwoks gave {{them what they}} had to eat: acorns, grass, and pine nuts. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> Eddy continued on {{with the help of a}} Miwok to a ranch in a small farming community at the edge of the Sacramento Valley. A hurriedly assembled rescue party found the other six survivors on January 17. Their journey from Truckee Lake had taken 33days.|$|E
5|$|Other bite {{symptoms}} {{that may occur}} in humans include edema, which may become extensive, shock, watery blood oozing from the puncture wounds, nausea and vomiting, subcutaneous bruising, blood blisters that may form rapidly, and a painful swelling of the regional lymph nodes. Swelling usually decreases <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> except for the area immediately around the bite site. Hypotension, together with weakness, dizziness and periods of semi- or unconsciousness is also reported.|$|E

50|$|The camp {{allowed the}} Romans {{to keep a}} rested and {{supplied}} army in the field. Neither the Celtic nor Germanic armies had this capability: they {{found it necessary to}} disperse <b>after</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> {{the main}} {{thrust of the}} {{offensive}} was halted south of Rimini by strong resistance and severe weather, and the British and Indian flanking forces began to push westwards, taking the frontline towards San Marino. On 17 September the 4th Indian Infantry Division attacked forces of the 278. Infanterie-Division holding two hills just across the Sammarinese border; after heavy fighting to gain control of the hills, the situation stabilised on the 19th, and Allied forces began to push into the city of San Marino itself. The city was captured by the afternoon of 20 September, and the 4th Indian Division left the country on the 21st, leaving it {{under the control of the}} local defence forces.|$|E
5|$|Another {{survivor}} was Katriel Katz, Israeli Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Katz {{had been}} {{expelled from the}} Soviet Union by Andrei Gromyko on 10 June 1967, {{the last day of}} the Six-Day War. During the evacuation from the aircraft, Katz was the only passenger to escape through the forward port door, despite the efforts of Hutchinson and Unwin to stop him using that door. The two flight crew were almost carried out through the door by Katz, who was a large man. Katz was seriously injured jumping from the doorway. He was taken to Hillingdon Hospital, where it was initially feared that he would become the sixth victim of Flight 712. Katz recovered <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> He died in 1988 aged 80.|$|E
5|$|By late May 1942, {{responsibility}} for the defence of Fiji shifted to the United States with a division arriving in the country. The 148th Infantry Regiment was {{to take over the}} positions of the 14th Brigade. While the 30th and 35th Battalions began packing and left the area by late June, the 37th had to wait until more American forces arrived. It was not until 5 August that the battalion boarded the American troopship President Coolidge and departed five days later. The battalion reached Auckland on 13 August and proceeded to Pukekohe where a camp had been established. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> the battalion personnel went on leave for two weeks.|$|E
50|$|On January 26, 2004, {{the bridge}} {{suffered}} minor damage when a tanker truck exploded while passing over. Repairs were originally {{expected to take}} at least two weeks, but the bridge re-opened <b>after</b> just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|R

5|$|Film {{historian}} Film News Anandan noticed {{publicity stills}} of Nadodi Mannan on Veerappan's office desk when {{he happened to}} visit the office of Em.Gee.Yar Pictures. He then offered to distribute them to the press. Veerappan agreed knowing that Anandan was then {{a member of the}} South Indian Film Journalists Association. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> stills of the film were published in many magazines. Ramachandran was impressed with Anandan's work and, at Veerappan's suggestion, hired him as the film's public relations officer (PRO). This was Anandan's debut film as a PRO; however, his name does not appear in the opening credits.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the 1981 title Defender, Williams searched for new {{creative}} staff. Believing video games to be the future of entertainment, Newcomer left his job as a toy designer to work at the company who hired him to create game ideas as support for development staff. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> he generated a list of ideas that included game ideas for The War of the Worlds and Joust, Newcomer's top two choices. Technical specifications dictated the selection; Newcomer's vision of The War of the Worlds was infeasible, but Joust could be accomplished with Williams' available hardware. A development team was formed, which decided to create the game using Defenders hardware.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm moved ashore, high winds {{prevented}} disaster teams from assessing damage in the affected areas. By February18, CARE international had dispatched relief teams to the most affected regions. The teams distributed plastic tarps and food for 10,000people. High winds halted locust-control operations, while heavy rainfall provided favorable breeding conditions. In {{the area of the}} cyclone's first landfall, most people were able to rebuild their houses using trees and supplies from the surrounding countryside. Overall, about 25,845people became homeless due to the cyclone, although most were able {{to return to their homes}} <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> after they were repaired. In the months {{after the storm}}'s passage, the European Commission allocated €200,000 ($287,000USD) to CARE France for the storm victims.|$|E

50|$|Ross Rebagliati won a {{gold medal}} in snowboarding when the sport made its Olympic debut at the 1998 Nagano games. Initially he was {{stripped}} of the medal when traces of marijuana were found in his blood during a drug test, but the IOC reversed its decision <b>after</b> <b>an</b> appeal <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> later because marijuana was only a restricted substance, not a banned substance.|$|R
5|$|In October, Diederichs {{planned to}} rotate his ships through repair {{facilities}} in the region for periodic maintenance; Prinzess Wilhelm was scheduled to dock in Shanghai. He requested permission to take Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser to Kiaochou for autumn gunnery training and to leave Prinzess Wilhelm stationed there during the winter, which was denied. Diederichs {{was able to make}} use of the murder of a pair of German priests on 6 November in Shangtung, however, to justify his move against Kiaochou. At the time, the only ships available for the attack were Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser. Cormoran joined the two ships <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> and by 10 November, the ships were ready. Prinzess Wilhelm left port on the 11th, to rendezvous with Kaiser and Cormoran at sea.|$|E
5|$|Many adult dragonflies have {{brilliant}} iridescent or metallic colours {{produced by}} structural coloration, making them conspicuous in flight. Their overall coloration {{is often a}} combination of yellow, red, brown, and black pigments, with structural colours. Blues are typically created by microstructures in the cuticle that reflect blue light. Greens often combine a structural blue with a yellow pigment. Freshly emerged adults, known as tenerals, are often pale-coloured and obtain their typical colours <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> some have their bodies covered with a pale blue, waxy powderiness called pruinosity; it wears off when scraped during mating, leaving darker areas.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture is a {{scavenger}} and subsists {{entirely on}} carrion. It will eat roadkill or other animal carcasses. It prefers fresh meat, but often cannot {{make the first}} cut into the carcass of a larger animal as its beak is {{not strong enough to}} tear into the tough hide. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> the greater yellow-headed vulture will no longer feed on a piece of carrion, as the meat will begin to decay and become contaminated with microbial toxins. It will drink water from a pool, pond, or any receptacle provided. Like other vultures, they {{play an important role in}} the ecosystem by disposing off carrion which could otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E
50|$|In late June 2017 {{the unit}} {{deployed}} to the East Hama front but was withdrawn <b>after</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> due to unknown reasons. In early July 2017 report emerged {{that members of}} the unit had allegedly desecrated corpses of killed ISIL terrorists.|$|R

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> {{out of the}} line, the {{battalion}} resumed its advance on 20 April with the 6th Brigade, still as its reserve. However, {{a few days later}} the vehicle in which Norman, {{the battalion}}'s commander, was travelling ran over a landmine. Norman was wounded and had to be medically evacuated. He was replaced by the second-in-command of the 26th Battalion, Major A. Barnett, who was promoted to lieutenant colonel. The advance continued, effectively unopposed, with the 25th Battalion leading. Despite expecting the worst, it crossed the Po River with minimal difficulty on 25 April and the Adige River was traversed the next day, again with relative ease. The 9th Infantry Brigade then took over the advance, with the 6th Brigade taking over as the divisional reserve. Although the war was nearly over, care was still required as the battalion moved forward through the towns of Padua and Gorizia, before the surrender of all German forces in Italy on 2 May.|$|E
5|$|But the Three Leagues {{had already}} called upon the Swiss {{for help and}} troops from Uri had already arrived in Chur. Upon {{learning}} about the truce, they withdrew, but met a small troop of Habsburg soldiers {{on their way back}} home. When those engaged in the usual insults on the Swiss, the latter crossed the Rhine and killed the scoffers. In retaliation, Habsburg troops sacked the village of Maienfeld on February 7 and called the Swabian League for help. Only five days later, Swiss troops from several cantons had been assembled and reconquered the village and moved towards Lake Constance, pillaging and plundering along the way. On February 20, they again met a Habsburg army, which they defeated in the battle of Hard on the shores of Lake Constance near the estuary of the Rhine, and at about the same time, other Swiss troops invaded the Hegau region between Schaffhausen and Constance. On both sites, the Swiss retreated <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
