5|$|Due to Madagascar's highly {{seasonal}} climate, lemur evolution {{has produced a}} level of species diversity rivaling {{that of any other}} primate group. Until shortly after humans arrived on the island around 2,000years ago, there were lemurs as large as a male gorilla. Today, there are nearly 100 species of lemurs, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur taxonomic classification is controversial and depends on which species concept is used. Even the higher-level taxonomy is disputed, with some experts preferring to place most lemurs within the infraorder Lemuriformes, while others prefer Lemuriformes to contain all living strepsirrhines, placing all lemurs in the superfamily Lemuroidea and all lorises and galagos in the superfamily Lorisoidea.|$|E
5|$|A {{study with}} an intent-to-treat {{prospective}} design {{was published in}} 1998 by a team from the Johns Hopkins Hospital and followed-up by a report published in 2001. As with most studies of the ketogenic diet, there was no control group (patients who did not receive the treatment). The study enrolled 150 children. After three months, 83% of them {{were still on the}} diet, 26% had experienced a good reduction in seizures, 31% had had an excellent reduction and 3% were seizure-free. At twelve months, 55% were still on the diet, 23% had a good response, 20% had an excellent response and 7% were seizure-free. Those who had discontinued the diet by this stage did so because it was ineffective, too restrictive or due to illness, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who remained were benefiting from it. The percentage of those still on the diet at two, three and four years was 39%, 20% and 12% respectively. During this period the most common reason for discontinuing the diet was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better. At four years, 16% of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency, 14% had an excellent reduction and 13% were seizure-free, though these figures include many who were no longer on the diet. Those remaining on the diet after this duration were typically not seizure-free but had had an excellent response.|$|E

5|$|In {{an initial}} attempt {{to settle the}} area, the {{government}} declared the land open for pastoral settlement by ordinary settlers, but little progress was made. By 1840, the population was just fifty-three, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> were in or near Bunbury (then known as Port Leschenault). The settlement of Australind by the Western Australian Land Company in 1840–41 prompted the first real need for a good quality road to Perth. Throughout much of 1842, there was much debate and discussion over providing a new route to Bunbury. A coastal route from Fremantle had been proposed, while an alternative proposal published on 11 May was a new route from Pinjarra to Bunbury, via an upstream crossing of the Harvey River, where a bridge could easily be built. The coastal route would have required a ferry to cross the Murray River's estuary, and would not go through Pinjarra, a significant settlement in the area; however, it would be shorter, had more water along the route, and would go through the village of Mandurah, which had a population of twenty-nine people from six families.|$|E
5|$|Isis {{was one of}} many non-Greek deities whose cults {{became part}} of Greek and Roman {{religion}} during the Hellenistic period (323–30 BCE), when Greek people and culture spread to lands across the Mediterranean <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> same lands were conquered by the Roman Republic. Under the influence of Greco-Roman tradition, some of these cults, including that of Isis, developed their own mystery rites. The mysteries of Isis could have emerged {{as far back as the}} early third century BCE, after the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty had taken control of Egypt. The Ptolemies promoted the cult of the god Serapis, who incorporated traits of Osiris and of Greek deities like Dionysus and the underworld god Pluto. Isis's cult was conjoined with that of Serapis. She too was reinterpreted to resemble Greek goddesses, particularly Demeter, while retaining many of her Egyptian characteristics. The mysteries of Isis, modeled on those in Demeter's honor at Eleusis, could have been developed at the same time, as part of this mingling of Greek and Egyptian religion.|$|E
5|$|The 2/14th Battalion {{was raised}} on 26 April 1940 at Puckapunyal, Victoria, {{shortly after the}} start of World War II as part of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), which was {{established}} at the time from personnel that had volunteered to serve in combat overseas. The battalion was assigned to the 21st Brigade, 7th Division, and would remain part of this formation throughout its existence. It had an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> were drawn from the state of Victoria, although some were allocated from other states later as reinforcements. Many of the battalion's initial recruits had previous military experience, having served in the Militia prior to volunteering for the 2nd AIF, with the majority having to relinquish rank to transfer. Officially the battalion's average age on formation was 29, although the battalion historian, William Russell, asserts that this is not necessarily accurate as men were found to have altered their ages both up (from as young as 15) and down (from as old as 55) upon recruitment. In keeping with 2nd AIF recruitment practices, there were many pairs of brothers who were early recruits; there was even one case of a father and son who served in the same platoon.|$|E

5|$|William of Poitiers {{describes}} a council called by Duke William, {{in which the}} writer gives an account of a great debate that took place between William's nobles and supporters over whether to risk an invasion of England. Although some sort of formal assembly probably was held, {{it is unlikely that}} any debate took place, as the duke had by then established control over his nobles, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> assembled would have been anxious to secure their share of the rewards from the conquest of England. William of Poitiers also relates that the duke obtained the consent of Pope Alexander II for the invasion, along with a papal banner. The chronicler also claimed that the duke secured the support of Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and King Sweyn II of Denmark. Henry was still a minor, however, and Sweyn was more likely to support Harold, who could then help Sweyn against the Norwegian king, so these claims should be treated with caution. Although Alexander did give papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded, no other source claims papal support prior to the invasion. Events after the invasion, which included the penance William performed and statements by later popes, do lend circumstantial support to the claim of papal approval. To deal with Norman affairs, William put the government of Normandy into the hands of his wife {{for the duration of the}} invasion.|$|E
