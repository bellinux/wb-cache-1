Quantitative structure-activity relationship studies of the LPS neutralization activities of <b>anti-endotoxins</b> were performed using charge and quantum chemical descriptors. Artificial neural network implementing the back-propagation algorithm was selected for the multivariate analysis. The predicted activities from leave-one-out cross-validation were well correlated with the experimental values as observed from the correlation coefficient and root mean square error of 0. 930 and 0. 162, respectively.

50|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{are commonly}} used for pain relief, reduction of inflammation, and for their <b>anti-endotoxin</b> effects, but {{care must be taken}} since they may produce gastrointestinal ulceration and damage the kidneys. Due to a suspected link to Clostridial infection, anti-microbials are often administered, usually penicillin or metronidazole. Aminoglycosides should be used with extreme caution due to the risk of nephrotoxicosis (damage to the kidney). The mucosa of the intestines is damaged with DPJ, often resulting in absorption of endotoxin and risking laminitis, so therapy to combat and treat endotoxemia is often employed. This includes treatment with drugs that counteract endotoxin such as Polymyxin B and Bio-Sponge, fluid support, and laminitis prevention such as icing of the feet. Prokinetic drugs such as lidocaine, erythromycin, metoclopramide, and bethanechol are often used to treat the ileus associated with the disease.|$|E

Despite considerable progress in understanding basic pathogenesis of this disease, many subtle mechanisms of progressive inflammation in SLE are still unknown. It has been discovered that the persistent self-maintenance factors of autoimmune inflammation could be represented by lipopolysaccharides or endotoxins of Gram-negative intestinal bacteria. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the levels of major lymphocyte subpopulations, and their probable relation to specific <b>anti-endotoxin</b> antibodies and endotoxin-neutralizing receptors of granulocytes and monocytes in peripheral blood of SLE patients. The study involved forty-eight patients with SLE. The levels of lymphocyte subpopulations, expression of monocyte and granulocyte <b>anti-endotoxin</b> receptors, amounts of total and endotoxin-specific immunoglobulins were determined by means of, respectively, cytometric analysis and enzyme immunoassay techniques. The results of study have shown an increase in overall numbers of activated and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, a decrease in lymphocytes and NK-cells, diminished levels endotoxin-binding receptors on the monocytes and granulocytes, along with increased <b>anti-endotoxin</b> IgG antibodies. Our study revealed correlations between the levels of the leukocyte endotoxin-binding receptors, and B-lymphocyte contents, like as some associations between <b>anti-endotoxin</b> IgM antibodies, and the levels of B-lymphocytes, and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. A correlation was also found between <b>anti-endotoxin</b> IgG antibodies and CD 4 + lymphocyte levels. Significant alterations of the endotoxin-specific immunity among SLE patients suggest that this imbalance might play an important role in the mechanisms of onset and progression of autoimmune diseases. </p...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesAcute limb {{ischaemia}} is {{a common}} and often lethal clinical event. Reperfusion of an ischaemic limb {{has been shown to}} induce a remote gut injury associated with transmigration of endotoxin into the portal and systemic circulation, which in turn has been implicated in the conversion of the sterile inflammatory response to a sepsis syndrome, after lower torso ischaemia-reperfusion injury. This study tests the hypothesis that an <b>anti-endotoxin</b> hyperimmune globulin attenuates ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) associated sepsis syndrome. DesignProspective, randomised placebo controlled trial, animal experiment. Materials and methodsExperimental porcine model, bilateral hind limb I/R injury, randomised to receive <b>anti-endotoxin</b> hyperimmune globulin or placebo. ResultsBilateral hind limb I/R injury significantly increased intestinal mucosal acidosis, portal endotoxaemia, plasma cytokine (TNF-alpha, IL- 6, IL- 8) concentrations, circulating phagocytic cell priming and pulmonary leukosequestration, oedema, and capillary-alveolar protein leak. Conversely, pigs treated with <b>anti-endotoxin</b> hyperimmune globulin (IgG) 20 mg/kg at onset of reperfusion had significantly reduced portal endotoxaemia, early circulating phagocytic cell priming, plasma cytokinaemia and attenuation of acute lung injury. ConclusionsEndotoxin translocation across a hyperpermeable gut barrier, phagocytic cell priming and cytokinaemia are key events of limb I/R injury induced systemic inflammation and acute lung injury. This study shows that an <b>anti-endotoxin</b> hyperimmune globulin attenuates portal endotoxaemia, which may reduce early phagocytic cell activation, cytokinaemia and ultimately acute lung injury...|$|E

MethodsUsing a incubating kinetic tube reader and kinetic turbidimetric assay (KTA), the concentration-response time curve of endotoxin reacted with {{limulus amebocyte lysate}} (LAL) at 37 °C were obtained and the action of four organic acids (OAs) on it were investigated. The four OAs were benzoic acid, salicylic acid, syringic acid and 2 -amino-benzoic acid from Radix isatidis. Meanwhile, the temperature variation caused by endotoxin with the four OAs was studied by the rabbit pyrogen test (RPT). ResultsIt was showed that a low concentration (1 mg/mL) of the four OAs had a little effect of <b>anti-endotoxin,</b> and when the concentrations of the four OAs were 30 mg/mL, the endotoxin was neutralized completely. The relationships between the concentrations of endotoxin and the OAs were all linear with correlation coefficients of greater than 0. 9995, indicating that the four OAs all had strong <b>anti-endotoxin</b> action, while syringic acid had the strongest action among the four OAs with IC 50 of 12. 84 mg/mL.

40|$|Background: LPS-binding protein (LBP) and its ligand CD 14 {{are located}} {{upstream}} of the signaling pathway for LPS-induced inflammation. Blocking LBP and CD 14 binding might prevent LPS-induced inflammation. In previous studies, we obtained a peptide analog (MP 12) for the LBP/CD 14 binding site {{and showed that}} this peptide analog had <b>anti-endotoxin</b> activity. In this study, we used in vitro directed evolution for this peptide analog to improve its in vivo and in vitro <b>anti-endotoxin</b> activity. Methods: We used error-prone PCR (ep-PCR) and induced mutations in the C-terminus of LBP and attached the PCR products to T 7 phages to establish a mutant phage display library. The positive clones that competed with LBP for CD 14 binding was obtained by screening. We used both in vivo and in vitro experiments to compare the <b>anti-endotoxin</b> activities of a polypeptide designated P 1 contained in a positive clone and MP 12. Results: 11 positive clones were obtained from among target phages. Sequencing showed that 9 positive clones had a threonine (T) to methionine (M) mutation in amino acid 287 of LBP. Compared to polypeptide MP 12, polypeptide P 1 significantly inhibited LPS-induced TNF-a expression and NF-kB activity in U 937 cells (P, 0. 05).

40|$|Endotoxin is {{a potent}} {{mediator}} of {{a broad range of}} patho-physiological effects in humans. It is present in all Gram negative (GN) bacteria. It would be expected that <b>anti-endotoxin</b> therapies, whether antibody based or not, would have an important adjuvant therapeutic role along with antibiotics and other supportive therapies for GN infections. Indeed there is an extensive literature relating to both pre-clinical and clinical studies of <b>anti-endotoxin</b> antibodies. However, the extent of disconnect between the generally successful pre-clinical studies versus the failures of the numerous large clinical trials of antibody based and other <b>anti-endotoxin</b> therapies is under-appreciated and unexplained. Seeking a reconciliation of this disconnect is not an abstract academic question as clinical trials of interventions to reduce levels of endotoxemia levels are ongoing. The aim of this review is to examine new insights into the complex relationship between endotoxemia and sepsis in an attempt to bridge this disconnect. Several new factors to consider in this reappraisal include the frequency and types of GN bacteremia and the underlying mortality risk in the various study populations. For a range of reasons, endotoxemia can no longer be considered as a single entity. There are old clinical trials which warrant a re-appraisal in light of these recent advances in the understanding of the structure-function relationship of endotoxin.

40|$|Neutralization of invading {{pathogens}} by gene-encoded peptide antibiotics {{has been}} suggested to manifest {{in a variety of}} different modes. Some of these modes require internalization of the peptide through a pathway that involves LPS-mediated uptake of the peptide antibiotics. Many proline/tryptophan-rich cationic peptides for which this mode has been invoked do, indeed, show LPS (endotoxin) binding. If the mechanism of antibiotic action involves the LPS-mediated pathway, a positive correlation ought to manifest between the binding to LPS, its neutralization, and the bacterial killing. No such correlation was evident based on our studies involving minimal active analogs of tritrypticin. The <b>anti-endotoxin</b> activities of these analogs appear not to relate directly to their antibiotic potential. The two palindromic analogs of tritrypticin, NT 7 (RRFPWWW) and CT 7 (WWWPFRR), showed comparable antibacterial activities. However, while NT 7 exhibited <b>anti-endotoxin</b> activity, CT 7 did not. The LPS binding of two tritrypticin analogs correlated with their corresponding structures, but the antibacterial activities did not. Further structure–function analysis indicated specific structural implications of the antibacterial activity at the molecular level. Studies involving designed analogs of NT 7 incorporating either rigid or flexible linkers between the specifically distanced hydrophobic and cationic clusters modulate the LPS binding. On the other hand, not knowing the target receptor for antibacterial activity is a drawback since the precise epitope for antibacterial activity is not definable. It is apparent that the <b>anti-endotoxin</b> and antibacterial activities represent two independent functions of tritrypticin, consistent with the emerging multifunctionality in the nature of cathelicidins...|$|E
40|$|In a {{study of}} 63 {{allogeneic}} and autologous bone marrow transplants, patients were randomized to receive the IgM and IgA enriched intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) preparation (Pentaglobin). Pentaglobin has been postulated to have <b>anti-endotoxin</b> properties {{and one of the}} aims {{of the study was to}} measure endotoxin levels in these patients together with the clinical sequelae of infection. The <b>anti-endotoxin</b> effects of Pentaglobin were found to reside in the IgM fraction. Those patients who received Pentaglobin were significantly protected from dying from infection in the first 100 days after the transplant, although it was not actually possible to document bacterial infections as the cause of death in the control patients. Peak endotoxin levels were significantly reduced (p = 0. 02) in those patients receiving Pentaglobin. Liver damage as assessed by liver enzyme abnormalities correlated significantly with the presence of endotoxaemia greater than 25 pg/ml and up to 70 % of pyrexial episodes were associated with endotoxaemia.

40|$|Surgical {{treatment}} {{of patients with}} obstructive jaundice {{is associated with a}} high postoperative morbidity and mortality. A correlation was suggested between endotoxins and the observed complications. The mechanism by which endotoxins affect the negative outcome in operated jaundiced patients was, however, not clear, nor was the mechanism of clinically used preventive treatments. Several experiments were therefore performed in rats with biliary obstruction, to investigate whether and how endotoxins are active. The role of endotoxins was studied in a model in which endotoxins were absent. In germfree rats (free of bacteria and thus of endotoxin) the effect of biliary obstruction was studied and compared with biliary obstruction in conventional rats. To substantiate further the role of endotoxin, <b>anti-endotoxin</b> treatments (oral lactulose or internal drainage) were tested in rats with obstructive jaundice undergoing a severe surgical trauma.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{profile of}} endotoxin liberation by bacterial multiplication and by antibiotic bactericidal action {{was investigated in}} vitro in a bacterial kill-kinetic model and in vivo in a rat E. coli peritonitis/sepsis model. The impact of a derivative of human immunoglobulin G, 5 S-IgG on endotoxin liberation was also assessed. Results demonstrated the antibiotic-induced endotoxin liberation by comparing the endotoxin concentrations after antibiotic administration with the base endotoxin levels. The absolute amount of antibiotic-mediated endotoxin release, however, was no greater than the amount of endotoxin released during bacterial multiplication. This indicates the importance of effective antibiotic therapy in elimination of bacteria, the source of endotoxin. In addition, 5 S-IgG demonstrated its <b>anti-endotoxin</b> activity {{as evidenced by the}} observation of decreased endotoxin concentrations with the presence of 5 S-IgG. ^ The kinetic profile of endotoxin-mediated TNF-α induction was investigated in vitro in human monocyte-enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in vivo in a rat endotoxin septic shock model. In response to endotoxin, PBMC cells produced significant amounts of TNF-α. 5 S-IgG showed its moderate <b>anti-endotoxin</b> activity by partially inhibiting the endotoxin mediated TNF-α release when given before triggering of TNF-α induction. However, this inhibitory effect rapidly diminished when 5 S-IgG was administered after the occurrence of TNF-α induction. Similar results were obtained from animal study in which endotoxin challenge initiated substantial amounts of TNF-α release into the rat circulatory system leading to death. The inhibitory effect of 5 S-IgG on endotoxin mediated TNF-α release and the resultant protective effect against endotoxin lethality were related to the timing of its administration relative to the endotoxin dosing. 5 S-IgG showed its moderate <b>anti-endotoxin</b> activity by partially suppressing the endotoxin mediated TNF-α release and decreasing the overall mortality only when given before triggering of TNF-α induction. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that the development of grain-negative sepsis may be a self-perpetuating process, which is initiated by the release of endotoxin, and the development of sepsis or its sequelae may no longer be affected by the persistence release of endotoxin into the circulation. ...|$|E

Methods: The in vitro antimicrobial activity of MSI- 78 was investigated against the commercially avail-able quality control strain Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. In addition, three rat models of septic shock were investigated: (i) rats were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg Escherichia coli 0111 :B 4 LPS; (ii) rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of 23 1010 cfu of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922; (iii) intra-abdominal sepsis was induced via caecal ligation and puncture. All animals were randomized to receive after 360 min intravenously isotonic sodium chloride solution, 1 mg/kg MSI- 78, or 60 mg/kg piperacillin. Main outcome measures were: abdominal exudate and plasma bacterial growth, plasma endotoxin and tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a) concentrations, and lethality. Results: Our in vitro data showed that MSI- 78 possesses a strong activity against Escherichia coli. The in vivo studies showed that all compounds reduced the lethality when compared to controls. MSI- 78 showed a slightly higher antimicrobial activity than piperacillin and achieved a substantial decrease in endotoxin and TNF-a plasma concentrations than the b-lactam.

40|$|Endotoxins, or Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) {{present on}} the surface of Gram {{negative}} bacteria {{play a key role in}} the pathogenesis of septic shock, a common clinical problem and a leading cause of mortality in critically ill patients, for which no specific modalities are available at the present time. The toxic moiety of LPS is a glycolipid called Lipid A, which is composed of a bis-phosphorylated diglucosamine backbone bearing up to seven acyl chains in ester and amide linkages. Lipid A is structurally highly conserved in Gram negative bacteria, and is therefore an attractive target for developing <b>anti-endotoxin</b> molecules designed to sequester, and thereby neutralize, the deleterious effects of endotoxin. The anionic and amphipathic nature of Lipid A enables the interaction of a wide variety of cationic amphiphiles with the toxin. A systematic evaluation of several structural classes of cationic amiphiphiles both peptidic and non-peptidic small molecules, in the broader context of recent efforts aimed at developing novel <b>anti-endotoxin</b> strategies. The derivation for the pharmacophore for LPS recognition has led to the identification of novel, nontoxic, structurally simple molecules, the lipopolyamines.

To confirm and expand observations that polymyxin nonapeptides have <b>anti-endotoxin</b> activity, we studied the ability of colistin nonapeptide to bind to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and to inhibit the effects of LPS on Limulus amoebocyte lysate and lymphocyte mitogenicity. Colistin nonapeptide was purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography and was demonstrated to bind to LPS by equilibrium dialysis. The ability of colistin nonapeptide to render E. coli ATCC 25922 cells sensitive to erythromycin was abrogated by 50 % after incubation with E. coli O 18 LPS in a ratio by weight of LPS to colistin nonapeptide of 3. 9 : 1. The presence of 4 micrograms of colistin nonapeptide or colistin per ml increased by 130 - and 800 -fold, respectively, the concentration of E. coli O 113 LPS required to produce 50 % gelation of Limulus amoebocyte lysate as measured by a spectrophotometric assay. Neutralization of LPS by colistin nonapeptide was time and concentration dependent. In contrast to the neutralization seen with LPS derived from a colistin-sensitive organism, colistin nonapeptide neutralized very little LPS extracted from a strain of Serratia marcescens that was resistant to colistin. Colistin nonapeptide also inhibited LPS-induced [3 H]thymidine uptake by splenic lymphocytes, but its activity was less than 1 / 10 that of colistin. We conclude that colistin nonapeptide binds to LPS and possesses antiendotoxin activity.

Introduction: Directed, effective therapies for feline sepsis are needed to reduce the high morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Materials and Methods: We investigated the <b>anti-endotoxin</b> effects of PMB in a blinded, placebo controlled fashion, both ex vivo in a feline whole blood culture system and in vivo, using a low-dose endotoxin infusion in cats (2 ug/kg/hr IV x 4 hours). Serial measures of systemic inflammation, and hemodynamic stability, were compared between groups. Results: Ex vivo, PMB significantly decreased LPS-induced TNF production from whole blood. In vivo, endotoxin infusion resulted in the development of fever, hypotension, leucopenia and increased TNF activity. Polymyxin B (1 mg/kg over 30 minutes) treatment decreased peak plasma TNF activity (p< 0. 001) and increased white blood cell count (p= 0. 019), with no adverse effects. Conclusions: Polymyxin B administration resulted in decreased peak plasma TNF activity and increased white blood cell count in this feline model of endotoxemia, with no adverse effects. Given the apparent safety and <b>anti-endotoxin</b> effects of PMB in this endotoxemia model, a carefully designed, randomized, blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial evaluating the use of PMB in naturally occurring Gram negative feline sepsis should be considered...|$|E
40|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (AMPs) are small, cationic peptides that {{possess a}} large spectrum of bioactivities, including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Several AMPs {{are known to}} inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced inflammation in vitro and to protect animals from sepsis. In this study the cellular anti-inflammatory and <b>anti-endotoxin</b> activities of Os and Os-C, peptides derived from the carboxy-terminal of a tick defensin (OsDef 2), were investigated. Both Os and Os-C were found to bind LPS in vitro, albeit {{to a lesser extent}} than polymyxin B and melittin, known endotoxin-binding peptides. Binding to LPS was found to reduce the bactericidal activity of Os and Os-C against Escherichia coli confirming the affinity of both peptides for LPS. At a concentration of 25 μM, the nitric oxide (NO) scavenging activity of Os was higher than glutathione (GSH), a known NO scavenger. In contrast, Os-C showed no scavenging activity. Os and Os-C inhibited LPS/IFN-γ induced NO and TNF-α production in RAW 264. 7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with no cellular toxicity even at a concentration of 100 μM. Although inhibition of NO and TNF-α secretion was more pronounced for melittin and polymyxin B, significant cytotoxicity was observed at concentrations of 1. 56 μM and 25 μM for melittin and polymyxin B, respectively. In addition, Os, Os-C and GSH protected RAW 264. 7 cells from oxidative damage at concentrations as low as 25 μM.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{hypothesized}} that a temporary cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) -induced reduction of endotoxin antibody levels contributes to elevated endotoxin levels {{and the associated}} inflammatory consequences, with a significant influence on the postoperative ventilation time period. BACKGROUNDCardiac surgery using CPB induces a systemic inflammatory response syndrome with an associated risk of increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. METHODSA total of 100 consecutive patients undergoing elective {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery using CPB were prospectively investigated. Endotoxin core antibodies (immunoglobulin [Ig] M/IgG against lipid A and lipopolysaccharide), endotoxin, interleukin (IL) - 1 -beta, IL- 6, IL- 8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were measured serially from 24 h preoperatively until 72 h postoperatively. RESULTSEighty-five patients had no complications (group 1), whereas 15 patients required prolonged ventilation (group 2). In both groups, there was a decrease of all antibodies 5 min after CPB onset, compared with baseline values (p < 0. 001), an increase of endotoxin and IL- 8 peaking at 30 min postoperatively (p < 0. 001) and an increase of IL- 6 peaking 3 h postoperatively (p < 0. 001). In group 2, preoperative antibody levels were lower (p < 0. 01) —specifically, the decrease in IgM was significantly stronger and of longer duration (p < 0. 002) —and levels of endotoxin (p < 0. 001) and IL- 8 (p < 0. 001) were higher at 30 min postoperatively.

Furthermore, lower levels of IgM <b>anti-endotoxin</b> core antibodies were associated with a greater rise in endotoxin and IL- 8, as well as prolonged respirator dependence...|$|E

Utilizing these models, agents with reputed <b>anti-endotoxin</b> activity were administered concomitantly with the delayed antibiotic therapy to determine if any could prevent gram-negative septic mortality no longer preventable by the antibiotics alone. The following were observed: (i) adrenal corticosteroids prevented mortality that was no longer preventable by optimal aminoglycoside antibiotics alone. The following were preventable by optimal aminoglycoside antibiotic therapy alone; (ii) specific antisera also did so, provided anaphylaxis was circumvented; (iii) in one model (P. mirabilis), such protection by adrenal corticosteroids and specific antiserum could be additive; (iv) adrenal corticosteroids and specific antiserum acted synergistically with the aminoglycoside antibiotics [...] no protection was achieved by delayed administration of the steroids or antiserum alone; (v) timing was crucial [...] the synergistic protective activity of adrenal corticosteroids and of specific antiserum with aminoglycosides declined rapidly as infection progressed; (vi) cyclophosphamide pretreatment markedly impaired the synergistic protective activity of specific antiserum and of adrenal corticosteroids with aminoglycosides; (vii) no reputed <b>anti-endotoxin</b> agents other than adrenal corticosteroids and specific antiserum proved capable of preventing mortality not preventable by aminoglycoside antibiotics alone. These included antisera to rough mutant Enterobacteriaceae of Rc, Rd, and Re chemotypes, anticoagulants (heparin), ascorbic acid, antiproteolytic agents (aprotinin), alpha adrenergic blockers (phenoxybenzamine), prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors (acetylsalicylic acid, sodium salicylate, indomethacin), nicotinamide, glucose, and insulin-glucose-potassium mixtures...|$|E
40|$|Endotoxin was {{measured}} in over 1000 plasma samples from bone marrow transplant patients in a randomized trial of the IgM-enriched intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) Pentaglobin. Peak endotoxaemia was significantly reduced (P = 0. 02) in patients receiving Pentaglobin and 70 % of all pyrexias of unknown origin were associated with endotoxaemia. Gut mucosal damage, assessed by lactulose/mannitol ratios, was significantly associated (P = 0. 02) with endotoxaemia. Specific IgM antibody to endotoxin core-glycolipid was significantly raised (P < 0. 01) in patients receiving the IVIG, and the IgM fraction of Pentaglobin was found to contain most of the <b>anti-endotoxin</b> antibody activity of the IVIG. These results suggest a role for IgM-enriched IVIG as a prophylactic agent for the reduction of endotoxaemia and its consequences in bone marrow transplant patients...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effect of electro-acupuncture of Neiguan (PC 6) on mean {{systemic}} arterial blood pressure and plasmic concentrations of NO and TNFα in endotoxin shock rats. Methods: The model of endotoxin shock was induced by lipopolysaccharide (1. 5 mg/kg i. v.) and D-galactosamine (100 mg/kg i. p.). Aminoguanidine (100 mg/kg i. p.) and electro-acupuncture of bilateral Neiguan (PC 6) were administered. A catheter was inserted into the right subclavian artery to record the change of blood pressure and the blood was abstracted out and centrifuged to determine the NO and TNFα concentrations. Results: Electro-acupuncture of Neiguan (PC 6) retrieved the blood pressure and reduced the plasmic NO and TNFα concentrations. Conclusion: Electro-acupuncture of Neiguan (PC 6) expresses an <b>anti-endotoxin</b> shock effect by repressing the plasmic NO and TNFα concentrations smoothly and retrieving the blood pressure stably...|$|E
40|$|Isatis indigotica is a {{biennial}} herbaceous cruciferous medical herb with antipyretic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and <b>anti-endotoxin</b> activity. This study {{explored the}} chemotherapeutic potential of I indigotica on human hepatoma cells and investigated the {{mechanism by which}} metabolites from I indigotica inhibit hepatoma cell growth. Antitumor activity was discovered in dried I indigotica leaf chloroform extracts (CEDLI). In nude mice xenotransplanted with human hepatoma cells, CEDLI supplementation inhibited tumor growth by similar to 40 % compared with nonsupplemented animals without affecting body weight/food intake. CEDLI induced sub-G 1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, CEDLI activates p 53 and Bax, reduces Bcl- 2 expression, and causes mitochondrial stress {{and the release of}} apoptosis-inducing factor into the cytosol followed by its translocation into the nucleus, resulting in hepatoma cell apoptosis. This study provides novel in vivo evidence of I indigotica's antitumor activity. The chemotherapeutic activity against human hepatoma tumorigenesis was because of a distinguished caspase-independent apoptotic pathway...|$|E
40|$|An eight-year-old Holstein cow {{presented}} to Cornell’s Equine and Farm Animal Hospital for mastitis un-responsive to treatment. She {{was referred to}} Cornell from her primary veterinarian following a six day history of mastitis, weakness, anorexia and drop in milk production. On presentation she was febrile (105. 1 F), tachycardic (HR 96 beats/min), moderately dehydrated and had bilateral hemorrhagic sclerae. Her udder was warm, firm, hyperemic and asymmetrically swollen and her milk was yellow and watery with white flakes. Initial blood work revealed several hematological and biochemical abnormalities suggestive of systemic inflammation including an inflammatory leukogram. Further hematology the following day revealed toxic changes in neutrophils, thrombocytopenia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia and hypoalbuminemia. The patient was bolused IV fluids to restore volume deficit, administered flunixin meglumine as an anti-inflammatory and <b>anti-endotoxin</b> and was started on intravenous oxytetracycline as an antimicrobial. She was also given oxytocin and all four quarters were milked out every four hours with hand stripping when necessary...|$|E
40|$|Immune-defective and immunologically normal F 1 mice {{derived from}} the CBA/N strain were used to study the {{influence}} of <b>anti-endotoxin</b> antibody on the lethal effects of endotoxin. Immune-defective F 1 male mice were unable to make specific responses to purified preparations of E. coli O 111 :B 4 endotoxin, whereas their immunologically normal F 1 female littermates made excellent responses. The ability to form antibody to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in these F 1 mice did not influence either their natural resistance to endotoxin challenge or the effects of pretreatment with sublethal amounts of endotoxin on subsequent challenge with higher normally lethal doses. Furthermore, transfer of sera with high titers of anti-LPS antibody to mice prior to challenge with LPS failed to protect. Thus, anti-LPS antibody {{does not appear to}} {{play a critical role in}} protection of immune-defective (CBA/N X DBA/ 2) F 1 male mice to the lethal effects of endotoxin or to the protective effects of a single sublethal dose of endotoxin on subsequent endotoxin challenge...|$|E
40|$|The role of <b>anti-endotoxin</b> {{antibodies}} in {{the management}} of gram-negative bacteremia and the experimental and clinical studies on the cross-protection afforded by core LPS antibodies are reviewed. These studies did not achieve clarification of the epitope(s) and effector mechanism(s) involved in protection. Recently, two anti-lipid A IgM monoclonal antibodies, designated E 5 and HA- 1 A, have been investigated in patients with gram-negative bacterial infections and clinical manifestations of septicemia. E 5 reduced the mortality of patients if they were not in shock, whether they were bacteremic or not. A confirmatory study has been initiated. In contrast to E 5, HA- 1 A protected patients whether they were in shock or not, but only when they were bacteremic at randomization. Although these studies suggest beneficial effects, the type of patients who may benefit from this expensive therapy should be further defined. Further investigations are needed to clarify the mechanisms of protection of these antibodies...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} endodontic therapy is to {{preserve}} the patient’s natural teeth without compromising the patient’s local or systemic health. Calcium hydroxide has been in-cluded in several materials and antimicrobial formulations {{that are used in}} several treatment modalities in endodontics, such as inter-appointment intracanal medica-ments. The purpose of this article was to review the antimicrobial properties of calcium hydroxide in endodontics. Calcium hydroxide has a high pH (approximately 12. 5 - 12. 8) and is classified chemically as a strong base. The lethal effects of calcium hydroxide on bacterial cells are probably due to protein denaturation and damage to DNA and cytoplasmic membranes. Calcium hydroxide has a wide range of antimicrobial activity against common endodontic pathogens but is less effective against Enterococcus faeca-lis and Candida albicans. Calcium hydroxide is also a valuable <b>anti-endotoxin</b> agent. However, its effect on microbial biofilms is controversial.

40|$|We have {{previously}} described cross-reactive antilipopolysaccharide (anti-LPS), or <b>anti-endotoxin,</b> monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which provide cross-protection in several systems of endotoxin bioactivity. The protective {{effects of the}} murine cross-reactive MAb WN 1 222 - 5 (immunoglobulin G 2 a(kappa) [IgG/ 2 a(kappa) ]) and of its chimerized version, SDZ 219 - 800 [human IgG 1 (kappa) ], have now been evaluated in lethality models against LPS from three different serotypes and in bacterial infection models. We confirmed the protective activity of the two MAbs in D-galactosamine-sensitized mice challenged with LPS of other E. coli serotypes (O 18, O 127, and O 111). The protective effect correlated with the suppression of tumor necrosis factor formation. Furthermore, WN 1 222 - 5 enhanced bacterial clearance of intravenously administered E. coli O 111 bacteria, thus protecting mice from death. However, the MAbs were unable to provide protection in a peritonitis model (intraperitoneal inoculation). Our study, therefore, shows that LPS cross-reactive antibodies are capable of mediating cross-protection against LPS and bacteria but that the selected models have a clear influence on the results...|$|E
40|$|The {{surgical}} {{removal of}} primary tumours {{has been associated}} with the subsequent growth of previously dormant metastases. This accelerated growth has previously been ascribed to the removal of the primary tumour and the anti-angiogenic factors they produce, such as angiostatin and endostatin. Endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a cell wall constituent of gram negative bacteria, ubiquitously present in air and endogenous gut bacteria, that may be introduced during surgery. LPS {{has been shown to be}} angiogenic and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the most potent angiogenic cytokine identified to date. The role of endotoxin in surgically induced metastatic tumour growth, the therapeutic use of <b>anti-endotoxin</b> agents in the perioperative period, the regulation of VEGF expression by endotoxin and the effect of VEGF and endotoxin on tumour cell survival was examined. A murine model of experimental metastasis was established where no primary tumour was present. This allowed the effect of the surgical procedure on metastatic growth to be examined in the absence of any possible angiostatin / endostatin effect. Animals undergoing open surgery or laparoscopy with air sufflation of the peritoneum displayed increased metastatic tumour burden, reflected in higher proliferation and lower apoptosis within the metastases. Circulating levels of VEGF were also elevated in these groups and correlated with plasma levels of endotoxin. These changes were not observed in a group receiving laparoscopy with sterile C 0 2. Endotoxin injection resulted in similar effects, with increased metastatic burden and significantly higher serum VEGF levels than controls. The <b>anti-endotoxin</b> agent, rBPI 21, reduced metastatic growth and serum VEGF levels in mice following LPS injection or open surgery, whereas the monoclonal antibody, E 5, had no effect on tumour growth. LPS increased tumour cell proliferation and VEGF production. Endotoxin also increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis and enhanced the production of VEGF by endothelial cells and resulted in increased angiogenesis in vivo. LPS, through the induction of VEGF, or VEGF alone increased Bcl- 2 expression in tumour cells resulting in a significant decrease in tumour cell apoptosis. These results demonstrate that endotoxin plays a role in the enhanced growth of metastases following surgical trauma by altering the critical balances governing tumour growth. Treatment with the antiendotoxin agent, rBPI 2), blocked post-operative growth of metastases. Endotoxin regulates immune and tumour cell production of VEGF. Furthermore, endotoxin, through the induction of VEGF, or VEGF alone act as survival factors for tumour cells...|$|E
