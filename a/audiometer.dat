2500|$|Although Alexander Graham Bell is {{most often}} {{associated}} with {{the invention of the}} telephone, his interests were extremely varied. According to one of his biographers, Charlotte Gray, Bell's work ranged [...] "unfettered across the scientific landscape" [...] and he often went to bed voraciously reading the Encyclopædia Britannica, scouring it for new areas of interest. The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, four for the photophone, one for the phonograph, five for aerial vehicles, four for [...] "hydroairplanes", and two for selenium cells. Bell's inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing, the <b>audiometer</b> to detect minor hearing problems, a device to locate icebergs, investigations on how to separate salt from seawater, and work on finding alternative fuels.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{long after}} the war Low started the Low Engineering Company Ltd in {{association}} with the Hon. C. N. Bruce (later Lord Aberdare). [...] The company offices were on Kensington High Street, and Low spent much of his time trying to bring his inventions to fruition. [...] As usual though he was easily distracted by gadgets that he devised, taking his attention away from the more important work. [...] One of the better gadgets was a motor scooter that Low invented and manufactured in conjunction with Sir Henry Norman. Despite his best efforts, business wasn't his strong point. [...] An example of this is the magazine he started up with his friend Lord Brabazon and others. [...] It was entitled Armchair Science, Low helped edit it, and at one point the sales figures were 80,000 a month, yet it never seemed to make a profit and was sold off. [...] Another of Low's delights was speed, especially racing cars or motorbikes. [...] He was a regular attendee at Brooklands and at one point invented a rocket propelled bike and numerous other gadgets and improvements for the internal combustion engine. [...] An example of Low's prescience is that he was worried about the number of road traffic accidents that were occurring and believed speed in cities should be restricted to 25mph using modern radio methods to enforce it. [...] One of Low's peeves was excess noise, to this end he invented an <b>audiometer</b> to measure and record noise in a visual form. [...] He conducted experiments on the London Underground and achieved some success in pinpointing trouble spots and reducing their impact by use of shields over the wheels and padding of the interior panels. In 1938 Low had lunch with a gentleman called William Joyce. [...] Joyce wanted Low to contribute an article to a paper he helped run. [...] Low declined the offer being too busy; it was only {{a couple of years later}} that Joyce gained infamy as Lord Haw-Haw.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>audiometer</b> generates pure tones, or transmits parts of speech.Another kind of <b>audiometer</b> is the Bekesy <b>audiometer,</b> in which the subject follows a tone of {{increasing}} and decreasing amplitude as the tone is swept through the frequency range by depressing a button when the tone is heard and releasing it when it cannot be heard, crossing {{back and forth over the}} threshold of hearing.

We measured the hearing of 161 male farmers and 75 male nonfarmers at the 1979 Missouri Farmers Association Agri-Fair and compared it with the hearing of 129 office workers from central Missouri. Fixed-level screening tests were conducted in both ears at three stimulus frequencies: 1000 and 2000 hertz at 20 decibels hearing level and 4000 hertz at 25 decibels hearing level. <b>Audiometers</b> were calibrated {{in accordance with the}} ANSI- 1969 standard. The results show that farmers are at risk for hearing loss at 2000 and 4000 hertz when compared with office workers. The prevalence of hearing loss was greater for farmers at both frequencies in every decade age group from 25 to 64 years. Using screening failure at 2000 and 4000 hertz in both ears as a criterion for a loss that would affect communication ability, we found that the failure rate was 16. 8 percent for farmers and 6. 2 percent for office workers.

He was educated at West Monmouth School, University College, Cardiff (obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree in physics in 1927) and Jesus College, Oxford (obtaining a further Bachelor's degree in Natural Sciences in 1929). He started working for the Radio Corporation of America {{and then as a}} {{salesman}} for a manufacturer of electrical hearing aids. As he considered that the products he was selling were inadequate, he set up his company (Amplivox) to make better hearing aids. He designed the world's first wearable electronic hearing aid: the microphone went on the lapel, the amplifier went in the jacket pocket and the earphone was small enough not to need a headband. [...] Eventually, as technology improved, Stevens created a hearing aid that was small enough to fit completely in the outer ear. His hearing aids were used by Winston Churchill (who was Stevens's personal client), amongst others. He also designed <b>audiometers</b> and acoustic equipment such as protective communication headsets and helmets. He also had a comprehensive collection of aids to hearing, spanning 400 years.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} is to evaluate the electro-acoustic performance of a new audiometric bone vibrator, the B 81 from Radioear Corporation, USA. Comparison will be made with the widely used B 71 which has well-known limitations at low frequencies. Design: The B 81 {{is based on the}} balanced electromagnetic separation transducer (BEST) principle where static forces are counterbalanced so that nonlinear distortion forces are reduced and maximum hearing levels can be increased. Study sample: Maximum hearing level, total harmonic distortion (THD), frequency response, and electrical impedance were measured for six devices of each bone vibrator type on an artificial mastoid. Results: It was found that B 81 reaches 10. 7 - 22. 0 dB higher maximum (@ THD. 6 % or V-in. 6 V-RMS) hearing levels than B 71 for frequencies below 1500 Hz, and had significantly lower THD up to 1000 Hz. There was no statistically significant difference between their frequency response, except a deviation at the mid frequencies (alpha = 0. 01) where B 81 was more efficient and the electrical impedances were practically the same. Conclusions: In general, B 81 had an improved electro-acoustic performance compared to B 71 and is compatible with same <b>audiometers.</b> In particular, B 81 allows for sensorineural hearing loss to be measured at considerably higher hearing levels than with B 71 below 1500 Hz...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE : This report {{presents}} {{data from}} four studies to examine standard bone-conduction reference equivalent threshold force levels (RETFL), especially at 4 kHz where anomalous air-bone gaps are common. DESIGN : Data were mined from studies that obtained air- and bone-conduction thresholds from normal-hearing and {{sensorineural hearing loss}} (SNHL) participants, using commercial <b>audiometers</b> and standard audiometric transducers. STUDY SAMPLE : There were 249 normal-hearing and 188 SNHL participants. RESULTS : (1) Normal-hearing participants had small air-bone gaps at 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 kHz (- 1. 7 to 0. 3 dB) and larger air-bone gaps at 4 kHz (10. 6 dB). (2) SNHL participants had small air-bone gaps at 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 kHz (- 0. 7 to 1. 7 dB) and a larger air-bone gap at 4 kHz (14. 1 dB). (3) The 4 -kHz air-bone gap grew with air-conduction threshold from 10. 1 dB when the air-conduction threshold was 5 - 10 dB HL to 21. 1 dB when the air-conduction threshold was greater than 60 dB. (4) With the 4 -kHz RETFL corrected by the average SNHL air-bone gap, the relationship between RETFL and frequency is linear with a slope of - 12 dB per octave. CONCLUSIONS : The 4 -kHz air-bone gaps for listeners with SNHL could be avoided by adjusting the 4 -kHz RETFL by - 14. 1 dB.

The {{purposes of this study}} are: (1) to describe and analyze sound field stimuli, sound field test conditions, and sound field calibration procedures currently employed by audiologists nationwide, and (2) to investigate the extent of agreement between current practice and suggested practice from the current literature. Respondents to the survey were 418 ASHA certified audiologists, who answered questions on demographic variables, sound field testing conditions, and sound field calibration procedures. Eighty-one percent of the respondents use sound field audiometry as part of their audiological practice. Demographic characteristics of the respondents indicate that they were representative of the population of ASHA certified audiologists. Most respondents use two loudspeakers for sound field testing and use warbled pure tones for the stimuli.

40|$|Background : Wax in {{ear canal}} causes a {{sizeable}} burden on resources {{of health services}} to a country. Aim : The magnitude of impacted wax, its effect in a survey and cost of managing this problem were reviewed in 2002. Settings and Designs : A study was conducted during 1996 to estimate the magnitude and causes of hearing impairment and ear diseases in Oman. The authors further reviewed the data of community-based prevalence study to assess the role of impacted wax. Materials and Methods: Trained physicians used portable <b>audiometers</b> to test the hearing status of each ear. They used otoscopes to examine the ear. Persons suspected to have hearing impairment or ear disease were reexamined by audiologists and otologists to determine the causes of hearing impairment. The resources for managing impacted wax were also calculated. Results : In this survey, 11, 402 subjects of all ages were examined. Prevalence of impacted wax was 11. 7 &#x 0025; (CI 95 &#x 0025; 11. 1 - 12. 2). Impacted wax was significantly higher in females compared to males [RR = 1. 22 (CI 95 &#x 0025; 1. 10 - 1. 35) ]. It was more common in residents of regions with humid environment than those of regions with less humidity [RR = 1. 91 (CI 95 &#x 0025; 1. 67 - 2. 18) ]. Impacted wax in ear canal was associated with ear diseases. A total of 181, 000 Omani people were estimated to have impacted wax in the ear canal. Managing impacted wax could cost 3. 6 million US dollars to the ear care services. Conclusions : Impacted wax was a hindrance in the hearing survey, and countries should {{plan to deal with}} earwax in such surveys.

40|$|Purpose: Hearing loss is {{a common}} problem worldwide, {{and there is an}} ever- {{increasing}} need for more audiologists to be trained. Unfortunately, audiology students cannot always get the clinical experience they need during training. Virtual reality involving computer-based simulation of real-life training experiences is one way of compensating for this. While there are several virtual <b>audiometers</b> available for student use, few of these include the vital case history component. This study sought to develop an interactive virtual patient that includes this component, and to objectively measure the effect of training with this software on student performance. Method: Development of the Patient Simulator Program (PSP) took place in two phases – Phase One involved development of audiometric information and a brief case history summary for 25 patient cases, and Phase Two involved development of comprehensive case histories for these and identification of triggering phrases and keywords for eliciting each piece of information from the virtual patient. Twelve first year audiology students were recruited from the University of Canterbury and divided into matched groups based on their pre-test scores. An alternating treatment design across groups was used to evaluate participants on their verbal and written accuracy, experience, confidence, and efficiency scores on case history tasks. Results: A significant difference was found in verbal accuracy scores between groups at the mid-way assessment point (following simulator training), but not for written accuracy. Differences between groups were not significant at all assessment points for efficiency and experience measures. Confidence gains were greater for the second group to train with the simulator than the first, while performance gains were greater for the first group. Conclusion: These findings support the evidence that simulation training can enhance student’s skills, and provide the first objective evidence for the benefits of training for case history tasks with an interactive virtual patient. While the effect size was small, these findings are a promising springboard for future research into this area. While the PSP is not adequate to replace real clinical encounters, it has potential as an adjunct to the current training program...|$|R
