40|$|It is {{essential}} that we re-examine the way new drugs for life-threatening illnesses are assessed and regulated. The time taken to approve lifesaving medicines for general use outside of clinical trials is prohibitively slow; people are needlessly dying. The bioethics community {{should be at the}} forefront of change. In particular, the rigid adherence to Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) has become irrational. New regulatory frameworks are being proposed, including that of <b>adaptive</b> <b>licensing.</b> Whereas the current model uses a one-point-in-time, all-or-nothing system of regulation, <b>adaptive</b> <b>licensing</b> allows for progressive access to a new drug during the approval process. Indeed this may be the first instance where the contemporary practice of EBM needs to be abandoned due to inherent inefficiencies. In response to the inefficiencies of the current system, a collaboration of stakeholders has established NEWDIGS (NEW Drug Development ParadIGmS). The Feature Article by Halpin and colleagues, on which this Commentary is based, gives a sophisticated survey of relevant bioethical issues. In addition this Commentary outlines a novel bioethical model to align with proposed new regulatory frameworks: a distributive-benefit-at-equilibrium model...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Tracking of {{miniature}} robotic platforms involves major challenges in image recognition and data association. We present our 3 -year effort into developing the platform-independent, easy-to-use, and robust tracking software SwisTrack, which is tailored to research in swarm robotics and behavioral biology. We demonstrate {{the software and}} algorithms abilities using two case studies, tracking of a swarm of cockroaches, and a swarm-robotic inspection task, while outlining hard problems in tracking and data-association of marker-less objects. Tracking accuracy of a moving robot with respect to camera noise and the calibration model are calculated experimentally. Its open, platform-independent architecture, and easy-to-use interfaces (Matlab TM,Java TM, and C++), allowing for (distributed) post-processing of trajectory data online, make the software highly adaptive to particular research projects without changes to the source code. SwisTrack is publicly available on Sourceforge. net under the OSI <b>Adaptive</b> <b>License</b> and contributions from the robotics and biology community are encouraged. I...|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{advantages}} of <b>adaptive</b> <b>licensing</b> is to align the licensing of new medicines more closely with patient needs for earlier access to beneficial treatments. From an innovators perspective ‘earlier’ market access may seem an obvious incentive to gain earlier revenue generation.

40|$|Six new antituberculosis {{compounds}} in 4 classes are presently in clinical trials. Although these show substan-tial promise for drug-resistant (DR) tuberculosis, the presently planned studies of these compounds will not inform their optimal use, as each {{will be tested}} singly vs placebo with existing drugs, rather than in new regimens. Each successive regulatory approval will increase the size, cost, and complexity of trials for those that follow, causing delays during which suboptimal use will occur and resistance will emerge. This paper proposes {{the development of a}} novel regimen with the potential for use in both drug-sensitive (DS) and DR tuberculosis. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>licensing</b> for DR tuberculosis based on 2 -month sputum culture would shorten time to initial approval by several years. A global outcomes registry would confirm safety and effectiveness in both DS and DR tuberculosis, making possible the second transformation of tuberculosis treatment. We should do our utmost to see it succeed. Drug-resistant (DR) tuberculosis has emerged as a dis-tinct threat to world health in the 2 decades since the World Health Organization declared tuberculosis a “global health emergency ” [1 – 3]. Current treatments for DR tuberculosis show inferior efficacy, safety, an...|$|E

40|$|An {{estimated}} 33. 3 million {{adults and}} children are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and 2. 6 million new cases are diagnosed every year. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a prophylactic vaccine and an efficient cure for HIV. An effective prophylactic vaccine would provide protection by inducing neutralising antibodies and also elicit a robust cytotoxic lymphocyte response to eliminate virus-infected cells. CD 8 + T-cells detect and kill virus-infected cells after recognising viral peptide antigens presented by Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I molecules. CD 4 + T-cells {{play a central role}} in <b>adaptive</b> immunity by <b>licensing</b> immune action against pathogens after recognising peptides bound to HLA class II molecules. A hallmark of HIV infection is the tropism of the virus for CD 4 + T-cells, leading to an immunocompromised state in infected individuals. Two of the three major aims of this study were to identify HIV-derived peptides that may form targets of antiviral CD 8 + and CD 4 + T-cells. A proteomics-based approach was utilised to characterise HLA class I- and class II-bound ligands isolated from antigen presenting cells expressing disease relevant HLA molecules and selected HIV antigens. This study was able to generate one of the largest datasets of naturally presented HLA-bound peptides with around 20000 class I and 10000 class II peptides identified and characterised. Within this large dataset of constitutively presented peptides, 22 class I- and 17 class II-restricted HIV-derived ligands were identified, including previously documented T cell epitopes and several novel peptides. These previously unreported determinants included a HLA-B 57 -restricted peptide bearing a novel kynurenine post-translational modification. The immune reactivity towards selected peptides was subsequently measured in healthy and HIV-infected individuals. A subset of HIV-infected individuals control their viremia and do not go on to develop AIDS. This observation is frequently associated with possession of the protective HLA-B* 57 : 01 allele. There was an efficient selection of HIV envelope derived peptides by this allele compared to other disease associated HLA allotypes. This leads to the speculation that this property of HLA-B 57 may be associated with protection during HIV infection. While antiretroviral therapy has vastly improved the quality of life of those suffering from HIV, interruption of therapy leads to the reemergence of the virus. The third aim of this project was to explore the proteomes of latently infected cells, which remain the major impediment to a cure for HIV. A well-established CD 4 + T-cell line model of latency (J-Lat cells) was used to generate a comprehensive quantitative protein expression map of latently infected J-Lat cells and to follow changes in protein expression after viral reactivation by TNF-alpha. More than 9000 proteins and their modifications were identified and quantitated in latent and reactivated cells, making this study the largest of its kind. Several key pathways were perturbed in latently infected cells including proteins involved in cell signalling, energy generation, and transcription factors. This data highlights that latently infected cells have a discrete proteomic signature and has unveiled new drug and immunotherapeutic targets that could be used to eliminate this pool of virus...|$|R
40|$|Payers {{are a major}} {{stakeholder}} in any {{considerations and}} initiatives concerning <b>adaptive</b> <b>licensing</b> of new medicinal products, {{also referred to as}} Medicines Adaptive Pathways to patients (MAPPs). Firstly, the scope and necessity of MAPPs need further scrutiny, especially with regard to the definition of unmet need. Conditional approval pathways already exist for new medicines for seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases and {{only a limited number of}} new medicines are innovative. MAPPs will result in new medicines initially with limited evidence about their effectiveness and safety. Additional data are to be collected after approval. Consequently, adaptive pathways may increase the risk of exposing patients to ineffective or unsafe medicines. We have already seen medicines approved conventionally that subsequently proved ineffective or unsafe amongst a wider, more co-morbid population as well as medicines considered for approval under MAPPs but subsequently proved ineffective or unsafe in Phase III trials and were never licensed. MAPPs also put high demands on payers. Routine collection of patient level data is difficult with high transaction costs. It is not clear who will fund these. Other challenges for payers include shifts in the risk governance framework, implications for evaluation and HTA, increased complexity of setting prices, difficulty with ensuring equity in allocation of resources, liability and implementation of stratified use, Exit strategies also need to be agreed in advance, including price reductions, rebates or reimbursement withdrawals when price premiums are not justified. These issues and concerns will be discussed in detail including potential ways forward...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{development}} {{faces the}} double challenge of increasing costs and increasing pressure on pricing. To avoid {{that lack of}} perceived commercial perspective will leave existing medical needs unmet, pharmaceutical companies and many other stakeholders are discussing {{ways to improve the}} efficiency of drug Research & Development. Based on an international symposium organized by the Medical School of the University of Duisburg-Essen (Germany) and held in January 2016, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of three specific areas, i. e. public-private partnerships, adaptive designs and big data. Public-private partnerships come in many different forms with regard to scope, duration and type and number of participants. They range from project-specific collaborations to strategic alliances to large multi-party consortia. Each of them offers specific opportunities and faces distinct challenges. Among types of collaboration, investigator-initiated studies are becoming increasingly popular but have legal, ethical and financial implications. Adaptive trial designs are also increasingly discussed. However, adaptive should not be used as euphemism for the repurposing of a failed trial; rather it requires carefully planning and specification before a trial starts. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>licensing</b> can be a counter-part of adaptive trial design. The use of Big Data is another opportunity to leverage existing information into knowledge useable for drug discovery and development. Respecting limitations of informed consent and privacy is a key challenge in the use of Big Data. Speakers and participants at the symposium were convinced that appropriate use of the above new options may indeed help to increase the efficiency of future drug development...|$|E
40|$|The global rise of multi-drug {{resistant}} bacteria {{has resulted}} in the notion that an antibiotic apocalypse is fast approaching. This has led to a number of well publicized calls for global funding initiatives to develop new antibacterial agents. The long clinical history of phage therapy in Eastern Europe, combined with more recent in vitro and in vivo success, demonstrates the potential for whole phage or phage based antibacterial agents. To date, no whole phage or phage derived products are approved for human therapeutic use in the EU or USA. There are at least three reasons for this: (i) phages possess different biological, physical and pharmacological properties compared to conventional antibiotics. Phages need to replicate in order to achieve a viable antibacterial effect, resulting in complex pharmacodynamics / pharmacokinetics. (ii) The specificity of individual phages requires multiple phages to treat single species infections, often as part of complex cocktails. (iii) The current approval process for antibacterial agents has evolved with the development of chemically based drugs at its core, and is not suitable for phages. Due to similarities with conventional antibiotics, phage derived products such as endolysins are suitable for approval under current processes as biological therapeutic proteins. These criteria render the approval of phages for clinical use theoretically possible but not economically viable. In this review, pitfalls of the current approval process will be discussed for whole phage and phage derived products, in addition to the utilization of alternative approval pathways including <b>adaptive</b> <b>licensing</b> and Right to try legislation...|$|E
40|$|The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press {{on behalf}} of the European Society for Medical Oncology. While they account for one-fifth of new cancer cases, rare cancers are {{difficult}} to study. A higher than average degree of uncertainty should be accommodated for clinical as well as for population-based decision making. Rules of rational decision making in conditions of uncertainty should be rigorously followed and would need widely informative clinical trials. In principle, any piece of new evidence would need to be exploited in rare cancers. Methodologies to explicitly weigh and combine all the available evidence should be refined, and the Bayesian logic can be instrumental to this end. Likewise, Bayesian-design trials may help optimize the low number of patients liable to be enrolled in clinical studies on rare cancers, as well as adaptive trials in general, with their inherent potential of flexibility when properly applied. While clinical studies are the mainstay to test hypotheses, the potential of electronic patient records should be exploited to generate new hypotheses, to create external controls for future studies (when internal controls are unpractical), to study effectiveness of new treatments in real conditions. Framework study protocols in specific rare cancers to stepwisely test sets of new agents, as from the early post-phase I development stage, should be encouraged. Also the compassionate and the off-label settings should be exploited to generate new evidence, and flexible regulatory innovations such as <b>adaptive</b> <b>licensing</b> could convey new agents early to rare cancer patients, while generating evidence. Though validation of surrogate end points is problematic in rare cancers, the use of an updated notion of tumor response may be of great value in the single patient to optimize the use of therapies, all the more the new ones. Disease-based communities, involving clinicians and patients, should be regularly consulted by regulatory bodies when setting their policies on drug approval and reimbursement in specific rare cancers...|$|E
