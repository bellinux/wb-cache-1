50|$|Fryns et al. (1979) {{reported}} 2 stillborn sisters with {{a multiple}} congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by coarse facies with cloudy corneae, diaphragmatic defects, absence of lung lobulation, and distal limb deformities. A sporadic case {{was reported by}} Goddeeris et al. (1980). Fitch (1988) claimed {{that she and her}} colleagues were the first to describe this disorder. In 1978 they reported a single infant, born of second-cousin parents, who had absent left hemidiaphragm, hydrocephalus, <b>arhinencephaly,</b> and cardiovascular anomalies.|$|E
40|$|The ocular {{features}} of eight cases of <b>arhinencephaly</b> have been described. Prediction {{of the degree}} of brain involvement from the eye defects could not be made, but eye abnormalities were present in all cases. The relationship of these syndromes to chromosomal abnormalities is emphasized. In the less severe cases treatable endocrine dysgenesis must be excluded...|$|E
40|$|Well-developed {{striated}} muscle {{was found in}} the leptomeninges of a 2 day old infant with a 13 - 15 trisomy defect and multiple congenital anomalies. Except for <b>arhinencephaly,</b> minor sulcal abnormalities, and scattered microscopic cerebellar dysplasias the brain was well formed. The extreme rarity of this finding is noted and an attempt is made to explain it on an embryological basis. The implications of this observation in relation to some central nervous system tumours containing {{striated muscle}} are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Four {{patients}} {{are presented with}} the Goldenhar syndrome (GS) and cranial defects consisting of plagiocephaly, microcephaly, skull defects, or intracranial dermoid cysts. Twelve cases from the literature add hydrocephalus, encephalocele, and <b>arhinencephaly</b> to {{a growing list of}} brain anomalies in GS. As a group, these patients emphasize the variability of GS and the increased risk for developmental retardation with multiple, severe, or unusual manifestations. The temporal relation of proposed teratogenic events in GS provides an opportunity to reconstruct biological relationships within the 3 - 5 -week human embryo...|$|E
40|$|The craniofacial {{anatomy of}} an infant with facial {{duplication}} is described. There were four eyes, two noses, two maxillae, and one mandible. Anterior to the single pituitary the brain was duplicated and there was bilateral <b>arhinencephaly.</b> Portions of the brain were extruded into a large frontal encephalocele. Cases of symmetrical facial duplication {{reported in the literature}} range from two complete faces on a single head (diprosopus) to simple nasal duplication. The variety of patterns of duplication suggests that the doubling of facial components arises in several different ways: Forking of the notochord, duplication of the prosencephalon, duplication of the olfactory placodes, and duplication of maxillary and/or mandibular growth centers around the margins of the stomatodeal plate. Among reported cases, the female:male ratio is 2 : 1...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{incidence}} of holoprosencephaly with normal chromosomes {{has been estimated}} at between 1 in 16 000 and 1 in 53 394 live births. It {{has been found that}} during a 3 -year period in the Bristol and Weston Health District there were six cases of holoprosencephaly, two of which were familial, and these cases are described. This represents an {{incidence of}} 1 in 5200 and during the preceding 3 -year period the incidence in the same area was 1 in 14 520 births. Holoprosencephaly was first reported in 1882 by Kundrat ' under the term <b>arhinencephaly.</b> He described a spectrum of anomalies characterised by median dysplasia of the face and aplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts, hence the term arhinen-cephaly. Since then, there have been several reports of similar cases, 2 3 mostly sporadic but some familial, 4 - 10 ofwhich a small number were associated with endocrine dysgenesis. 11 12 In early reports of holoprosencephaly, chromo...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which the anatomical variations of the circle of Willis develop {{is considered to be}} related to haemodynamic factors, i. e. the differential growth of the various parts of the brain will continuously change the haemodynamic demands and consequently the flow patterns in the cerebral arteries. It is therefore to be expected that, if a selected part of the brain does not develop, the change in the haemodynamic demand will affect the development of some cerebral arteries. Consequently the arteries at the base of 2 arhinencephalic and 8 holoprosencephalic brains were studied in conjunction with the brain malformations. The defects of holoprosencephaly are believed to arise from a failure of the prosencephalon to separate fully into the telencephalon and diencephalon and become manifest {{at the time that the}} prosencephalon normally starts to separate into the hemispheres, i. e. 28 - 34 d p. c. Arhinencephalic brains are fully diverticulated. There is only a partial or complete agenesis of the olfactory tracts and bulbs. The defect causing <b>arhinencephaly</b> starts at 43 d p. c. In the arhinencephalic brains no particular vascular abnormalities were found. However, at the base of the holoprosencephalic brains no complete circle of Willis was present; the anterior part was lacking and was replaced by anterior branches which emerged unilaterally or bilaterally from the internal carotid artery. The choroidal arteries were of very large calibre and ran to the highly vascularised wall of the dorsal cyst which is usually present in holoprosencephalic brains. In contrast to the anterior part, the posterior arterial pattern was almost identical to the posterior part of the circle of Willis of normal brains. The basic vascular patterns found in the holoprosencephalic brains displayed the features of Padget's developmental stages 2 and 3 of the cerebral vasculature, i. e. the pattern that has normally developed within 28 - 40 d p. c. The further modification of this pattern could largely be understood from the functional demand imposed on the circulation by the enlarged anterior choroidal arteries. Because the development of the anterior part of the circle of Willis precedes the developmental derangement causing <b>arhinencephaly,</b> a complete circle was found in these brains...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInversion {{duplication}} and {{terminal deletion}} {{of the long}} arm of chromosome 13 (inv dup del 13 q) is a rare chromosomal rearrangement: only five patients have been reported, mostly involving a ring chromosome 13. We report on additional three fetuses with pure inv dup del 13 q: Patient 1 had macrosomia, enlarged kidneys, hypersegmented lungs, unilateral moderate ventriculomegaly, and a mild form of hand and feet preaxial polydactyly; Patient 2 had intrauterine growth retardation, widely spaced eyes, left microphthalmia, right anophthalmia, short nose, bilateral absent thumbs, cutaneous syndactyly of toes 4 and 5, bifid third metacarpal, a small left kidney, hyposegmented lungs, and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum; Patient 3 had widely spaced eyes, long and smooth philtrum, low-set ears, median notch in the upper alveolar ridge, bifid tongue, cutaneous syndactyly of toes 2 and 3, enlarged kidneys and pancreas, <b>arhinencephaly,</b> and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum. We compared the phenotypes of these patients to those previously reported for ring chromosome 13, pure 13 q deletions and duplications. We narrowed some critical regions previously reported for lung, kidney and fetal growth, and for thumb, cerebral, and eye anomalies...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a {{developmental}} field defect {{of the brain}} that results in incomplete separation of the cerebral hemispheres that includes less severe phenotypes, such as <b>arhinencephaly</b> and single median maxillary central incisor. Information on the epidemiology of HPE is limited, both because few population-based studies have been reported, and because small studies must observe a greater number of years in order to accumulate sufficient numbers of births for a reliable estimate. METHODS: We collected data from 2000 through 2004 from 24 of the 46 Birth Defects Registry Members of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research. This study is based on more than 7 million births in various areas from North and South America, Europe, and Australia. RESULTS: A total of 963 HPE cases were registered, yielding an overall prevalence of 1. 31 per 10, 000 births. Because the estimate was heterogeneous, possible causes of variations among populations were analyzed: random variation, under-reporting and over-reporting bias, variation in proportion of termination of pregnancies among all registered cases and real differences among populations. CONCLUSIONS: The data do not suggest large differences in total prevalence of HPE among the studied populations that would be useful to generate etiological hypotheses...|$|E
40|$|The Zika {{virus is}} the primary suspect in the large {{increase}} in microcephaly cases in 2015 - 6 in Brazil, however its role is unconfirmed despite individual cases of viral infections found in neural tissue. Here we consider the alternative that the insecticide pyriproxyfen, used in Brazilian drinking water for mosquito control, may actually be the cause. Pyriproxifen is an analog of juvenile hormone, which corresponds in mammals to regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development causes microcephaly. Methoprene, another juvenile hormone analog approved as an insecticide has metabolites that bind to the retinoid X receptor, and causes developmental disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin {{is another example of}} a retinoid causing microcephaly in human babies via activation of the retinoid X receptor. Moreover, tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer, Sumitomo, widely quoted as giving no evidence for developmental toxicity, actually found some evidence for such an effect, including low brain mass and <b>arhinencephaly</b> [...] incomplete formation of the anterior cerebral hemispheres [...] in rat pups. Finally, the pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is unprecedented [...] it has never before been applied to a water supply on such a scale. Claims that it is not being used in Recife, the epicenter of microcephaly cases, do not distinguish the metropolitan area of Recife, where it is widely used, and the municipality, where it is not. Given this combination of information we strongly recommend that the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended pending further investigation. Comment: 6 page...|$|E
40|$|The Zika {{virus has}} been found in {{individual}} cases but has not been confirmed as the cause of in the large number of cases of microcephaly in Brazil in 2015 - 6. Indeed, disparities between the incidence of Zika and microcephaly across geographic locations has led to questions about the virus's role. Here we consider whether the insecticide pyriproxyfen used in Brazilian drinking water might be the primary cause or a cofactor. Pyriproxifen is a juvenile hormone analog which has been shown to correspond in mammals to a number of fat soluble regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin A, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development has been shown to cause microcephaly. Methoprene, another juvenile hormone analog approved as an insecticide in the 1970 s has been shown to cause developmental disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another retinoid causing microcephaly via activation of the retinoid X receptor in developing fetuses. We review tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer Sumitomo, which actually found some evidence for this effect, including low brain mass and <b>arhinencephaly</b> in exposed rat pups. Pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is unprecedented, never having been applied to a water supply on a large scale. Claims that its geographical pattern of use rule it out as a cause have not been documented or confirmed. On the other hand, the very few microcephaly cases reported in Colombia and the wide discrepancies of incidence in different states across Brazil despite large numbers of Zika cases undermine the claim that Zika is the cause. Given this combination of potential molecular mechanism, toxicological and epidemiological evidence we strongly recommend that the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended until the potential causal link to microcephaly is investigated further.

40|$|The primary subdivisions of {{the brain}} (telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, metencephalon, and myelencephalon) have similar {{relations}} and comparable functions in all vertebrates. Accordingly, the landmarksthat define their boundaries {{can be regarded as}} reliable for following their development. On the basis of a more complete series of well preserved embryos than has been available hitherto, we present evidence that the subdivisions of the adult brain {{can be traced back to}} neural-fold stages in which a series of growth centers can be recognized, differing from one another in form, size, and relations. The possibility of following the constrictions between the various subdivisions throughout development has been doubted by some, notably Hochstetter (1919). At present we are convinced that they can be distinguished if certain criteria are followed. These are: (a) constrictions involve the neural tube as a whole; (b) constrictions do not give rise primarily to any neural centers; (c) constrictions change in relative length and width, and in certain stages they become inconspicuous in models. The anatomical descriptions of progressive stages of development have important practical implications. It is known, for example, that congenital malformations of the central nervous system in man are common and that they are responsible for a substantial portion of fetal wastage as well as infant mortality and morbidity. In certain patients comprehensive clinical studies may indicate the underlying abnormality, such as dysraphism, <b>arhinencephaly,</b> hypoplasia of the cerebellum. or absence of the corpus callosum. In addition, anatomical examination of the affected brains may reveal in detail such abnormalities as lyssencephaly, polymicrogyria, or other cortical dysgeneses. These very complex cerebral malformations can only be understood and unraveled in the light of normal development. An investigation of early development {{of the brain}} must necessarily begin with a stage in which the major landmarks of the adult brain can be readily identified. As progressively younger stages are analyzed certain landmarks can no longer be recognized, although others persist at least to the third week of gestation. We believe that the evidence on which this study is based can be followed more satisfactorily in this inverted sequence, and the detailed description is so presented. It is followed by a summary of the sequence of events written in the conventional manner, as far as the eighth week of gestation...|$|E
