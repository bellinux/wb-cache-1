40|$|The {{possibility}} that structurally unrelated food additives could show either joint actions or interactions has been assessed {{based on their}} potential to share common sites and mechanisms of action or common pathways of elimination. <b>All</b> <b>food</b> <b>additives</b> approved in the European Union and allocated numerical acceptable daily intake values were studied, initially based on the reports by the FAO-WHO Joint Expert Committee for Food Additives. Target organs were identified based on the effects reported at doses above the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in animal and human studies. The descriptions of the pathological and other changes reported {{were used to assess}} whether different additives, sharing the same target organ, would produce a common toxic effect. In all but a very few cases, the possibility of joint actions or interactions could be excluded on scientific grounds. The exceptions were on the liver (curcumin, thiabendazole, propyl gallate, and BHT), the kidney (diphenyl, o-phenylphenol, and ferrocyanide salts), the blood (azorubine and propyl gallate), and the thyroid (erythosine, thiabendazole, and nitrate). Toxicokinetic interactions were considered unlikely because of the low dosages involved, the diverse nature of the routes of metabolism and elimination, and the fact that enzyme induction or inhibition would have influenced selection of the NOAEL. Many of those additives which could not be excluded from showing joint actions or interactions would have low intakes; in some cases they were alternatives for the same application, thereby further lowering the combined intake. In consequence, joint actions or interactions between additives do not represent a significant health concern. (C) 2000 International Life Sciences Institute...|$|E

There {{is a legal}} requirement for governments to monitor the consumption of <b>all</b> <b>food</b> <b>additives</b> in the EU to ensure the ADIs are not exceeded, especially by young children.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the available literature on methods of extraction for approved natural colours in food and drink. Available analytical methods for the determination of EU-permitted natural food colour additives in foods and beverages have been critically assessed for their fitness for purpose in terms of their the key extraction and analysis procedures, selectivity (range) and sensitivity, especially with regard to maximum permitted levels, and their applicability for use in surveillance and in an enforcement role. The advantages and disadvantages of available analytical methods for each of nine designated chemical classes (groups) of natural colours in different food and beverage matrices are given. Other important factors such as technical requirements, cost, transferability and applicability are given due consideration. Gaps in the knowledge and levels of validation are identified and recommendations made on further research to develop suitable methods. The nine designated natural colour classes covered are: 1.

40|$|Abstract. Food {{safety is}} an {{important}} issue related to the government regulatory authorities, food industry and food consumers. And the increasing use of <b>food</b> <b>additives</b> has become a matter of public and administrative concern, so an extensive safety evaluation on <b>food</b> <b>additives</b> must be carried out {{and the use of the}} <b>additives</b> in <b>food</b> should be controlled by law. In the United States, the Congress has entrusted the FDA with the responsibility to ensure that new additives to be used in foods and the foods the consumers purchase are safe. This paper discusses the supervision and management system of <b>food</b> <b>additives</b> in the United States. The conclusion is that FDA has developed a scientifically rigorous, sound and dependable system to assure the safety of food, thus a new <b>food</b> <b>additive</b> must be approved by FDA before it can be used in food.
