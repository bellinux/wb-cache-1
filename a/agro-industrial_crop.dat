30|$|Shiraia bambusicola has {{demonstrated}} recently {{its potential for}} hypocrellin production in fermentation systems and particularly in SSF (Liang et al. 2009). Furthermore, corn {{was found to be}} the best substrate after evaluating eight kinds of <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>crops</b> and residues (Cai et al. 2010). Starch is the main constituent in corn, and it also is the main carbon source when hypocrellin was produced under SSF with S. bambusicola. In addition, it is generally assumed that there is a limitation in the oxygen supply to the cells that are in close contact with the substrate in solid-state cultures with filamentous fungi (Oostra et al. 2001; Rahardjo et al. 2005). The use ratio of corn substrate and oxygen supply were two key aspects which influenced the yield of hypocrellin under SSF. In order to produce hypocrellin at an industrial scale in the future, specific α-amylase AMY 365 - 1 and VHb were selected and overexpressed in Shiraia sp. SUPER-H 168. Three transformants included Phygamy 365 - 1 strain, Phygvgb strain and PhygPgpdAamy 365 - 1 -vgb strain were constructed.|$|R
30|$|In our {{previous}} work, we isolated a high-yield hypocrellin producing strain, Shiraia sp. SUPER-H 168 (Liang et al. 2009); hypocrellins produced by Shiraia sp. SUPER-H 168 under solid state fermentation (SSF) have been isolated and identified. At the same time, corn {{was found to}} be the best substrate after evaluating eight kinds of <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>crops</b> and residues (Cai et al. 2010). Compared with liquid state fermentation, SSF offers numerous advantages which include high volumetric productivity and relatively higher concentration of the products. SSF {{was found to be}} the best fermentation of industrialized production for hypocrellin with S. bambusicola. Cracked corn was produced from maize endosperm of which starch is the major constituent. Normal corn starch consists of about 75 % branched amylopectin and about 25 % amylose, that is linear or slightly branched (Sandhu and Singh 2007). In previous studies, residual starch of dry fermented substrate remained at a high level, and hypocrellin production was increased when external amylases were added (data was not showed in this study). In order to improve the yield of hypocrellin and increase the use ratio of corn substrate, an α-amylase gene amy 365 - 1 (GenBank accession no. MF 535183) from Shiraia sp. SUPER-H 168 was overexpressed.|$|R
40|$|In Peru the agro-export boom has {{determined}} {{a major shift}} of large farmers from traditional <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>crops</b> (coffee and cotton) to new agribusinesses (asparagus, oranges, avocados, apples). These dynamics have left room for the small farmers to enter the traditional agro-industrial sector, or into new niche markets {{as in the case}} of native cotton. On the North coast of Peru the cultivation of the native and naturally coloured cotton (Gossypium Barbadense spp. locally called algodón El País) is part of the Moche indigenous culture (a local pre-Inca population). Since 1949 the Peruvian legal prohibition to produce native cotton, linked to the risk of genetic contamination of the industrial white cotton cultivations, made the keeping of these traditional varieties very difficult. Nevertheless the situation has totally changed since 2008 due to Regulation n° 29224 declaring native cotton as a genetic, ethnic and cultural heritage of the country. This study analyses the economic feasibility of re-inserting the native cotton as part of the agricultural production of 50 farmers on the North coast of Peru, proposing a farm economic data analysis, scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis based on OFAT (One Factor at A Time) methodology: the results attest that in all the productive scenarios proposed (10 %, 25 % and 50 % of the farm agricultural surface growing native cotton) the average farm incomes are going to increase. Moreover the sensitivity analysis attests that also in the worst conditions of a 10 % decrease in the native cotton price, the average farm incomes with native cotton are higher compared to the business as usual scenario in all three productive scenarios proposed...|$|R

30|$|Livestock feed {{resources}} in Ethiopia are mainly obtained from natural and improved pastures, crop residues, forage <b>crops,</b> <b>agro-industrial</b> by-products and non-conventional feeds (CSA 2012). The contribution of these feed resources, however, depends {{up on the}} agro-ecology, the type of crop produced, accessibility and production system (Seyoum et al. 2001; Ahmed et al. 2010). Natural pasture is {{the major source of}} livestock feed in Ethiopia. However, its importance is gradually declining because of the expansion of crop production into grazing lands, redistribution of common lands to the landless and land degradation (Berhanu et al. 2009). Urban and peri-urban dairy production depends on purchased concentrate and roughage feeds with limited grazing (Azage et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|Effective {{utilization}} of available feed resources {{is the key}} for economical livestock rearing. Complete feed system {{is one of the}} latest developments to exploit the potential of animal feed resources in the best possible way. The complete feed is a quantitative mixture of all dietary ingredients, blended thoroughly to prevent separation and selection, fed as a sole source of nutrients except water and is formulated in a desired proportion to meet the specific nutrient requirements. The concentrate and roughage levels may vary according to the nutrient requirement of ruminants for different production purposes. The complete feed with the use of fibrous crop residue is a noble way to increase the voluntary feed intake and thus animal's production performance. In this system of feeding, the ruminant animals have continuous free choice availability of uniform feed mixture, resulting in more uniform load on the rumen and less fluctuation in release of ammonia which supports more efficient {{utilization of}} ruminal non-protein nitrogen. Feeding complete diet stabilizes ruminal fermentation, thereby improves nutrient utilization. This feeding system allows expanded use of <b>agro-industrial</b> byproducts, <b>crop</b> residues and nonconventional feeds in ruminant ration for maximizing production and minimizing feeding cost, thus being increasingly appreciated. However, to extend the concept extensively to the field and make this technology successful and viable for farmers, more efforts are needed to be taken...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of methane via anaerobic digestion of biomass, such as energy <b>crops,</b> <b>agro-industrial</b> wastes and OFMSW, {{would provide a}} clean fuel from renewable feedstock and would replace the fossil fuel derived energy. Because of this, the prediction of methane yield (as regards to gas volume and rate of production) of residual and waste materials is gaining increasing interest. The biochemical methane potential (BMP) test is widely used for anaerobic process feasibility and design purpose, providing information about the biodegradability of high solid content substrates. In this work, methane yield coefficients and first-order disintegration rates for five different substrates (apple waste, brewery spent grain, brewery yeast waste, maize silage and red chicories waste) are evaluated. BMP tests are performed in 5 L fed-batch stirred reactors at several inoculum/substrate ratios. All runs are performed without the addition of chemicals...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of different animal feedings operated in two distinct PDO (protected designation of origin) cheese production areas (Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano) on the microbiome of six full-scale biogas plants, by means of Illumina sequencing and qPCR techniques. The effects of feedstock (cattle slurry manure, energy <b>crops,</b> <b>agro-industrial</b> by-products), temperature (mesophilic/thermophilic), and operating time were also examined, as were the relationships between the predominant bacterial and archaeal taxa and process parameters. The different feedstocks and temperatures strongly affected the microbiomes. A more biodiverse archaeal population was highlighted in Parmigiano Reggiano area plants, suggesting an influence of the different animal feedings. Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta showed an opposite distribution among anaerobic plants, with the former found to be related to ammonium concentration.

30|$|Lignocellulosic plant biomass is {{the most}} {{abundant}} renewable bioenergy resource available on Earth.

Globally, large quantities of <b>agro-industrial</b> wastes and <b>crop</b> residues are available in plenty and efficient utilization and microbial biodegradation of these biomaterials will lead to several processes of great economic value [1]. Particularly in Asian countries, surplus amounts of lignocellulosic residues are available annually without much usage, namely rice straw (667.6 million tons) and sugarcane bagasse (74.8 million tons). These could be used as a potential bioresource material for cellulosic ethanol production [2, 3]. However, large amounts of these agricultural residues are still frequently burnt in the fields causing severe environmental pollution problems and may foresee in utilizing these biomass residues for various potential industrial applications, for example, production of microbial enzymes and liquid biofuels, etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of soil organic C (SOC) models {{capable of producing}} accurate predictions for the long-term decomposition of exogenous organic matter (EOM) in soils {{is important for the}} effective management of organic amendments. However, reliable C modeling in amended soils requires specific optimization of current C models {{to take into account the}} high variability in EOM origin and properties. The aim of this work was to improve the prediction of C mineralization rates in amended soils by modifying the RothC model to encompass a better description of EOM quality. The standard RothC model, involving C input to the soil only as decomposable (DPM) or resistant (RPM) organic material, was modified by introducing additional pools of decomposable (DEOM), resistant (REOM) and humified (HEOM) EOM. The partitioning factors and decomposition rates of the additional EOM pools were estimated by model fitting to the respiratory curves of amended soils. For this task, 30  EOMs from 8  contrasting groups (compost, anaerobic digestates, sewage sludge, <b>agro-industrial</b> waste, <b>crop</b> residues, bioenergy by-products, animal residues and meat and bone meals) were added to 10  soils and incubated under different conditions. The modified RothC model was fitted to C mineralization curves in amended soils with great accuracy (mean correlation coefficient 0. 995). In contrast to the standard model, the EOM-optimized RothC was able to better accommodate the large variability in EOM source and composition, as indicated by the decrease in the root mean square error of the simulations for different EOMs (from 29. 9 to 3. 7...|$|R
40|$|Biomethane is a {{renewable}} energy source that can be used, e. g., for transportation or injection in the natural gas grids. It is obtained from proper biogas treatment. Biogas {{is a mixture of}} mainly methane and CO 2 that can be produced from livestock effluents, municipal and industrial sewage sludge, energy <b>crops,</b> <b>agro-industrial</b> wastes, MSW landfills (in this case the gas is commonly called "landfill gas") etc. In order to obtain biomethane, CO 2 and other compounds must be removed from biogas. The type and the amount of pollutants depend upon the biogas source and determine which cleaning and upgrading techniques are the most suitable for gas purification. "Cleaning" {{is referred to as the}} pretreatment that allows the removal of all pollutants but carbon dioxide, while "upgrading" is the treatment for CO 2 removal. Since there are no clear guidelines for choosing among different upgrading techniques, this work analyzes two of the most commonly used processes: the water scrubbing and the chemical scrubbing (using amine solutions). By means of process simulation with commercial packages (such as Aspen Plus®), a comparison among the performances of the two techniques is made...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{bioprocesses}} such as Anaerobic digestion (AD), fermentative biohydrogen (BioH 2), and Bioelectrochemical system (BES), converting municipal, <b>agro-industrial</b> {{wastes and}} <b>crops</b> to energy have attracted accelerating interest. Anaerobic digestion (AD) however, still requires optimisation of conversion efficiency from biomass to methane. Augmenting methane energy production with simultaneous BioH 2 and bioelectrochemical stage(s) would increase process efficiencies while meeting post treatment effluent quality. Pre-treatment of feedstock increase bacterial accessibility to biomass, thus increasing the conversion yield to target product, but an alternative is separating the acidogenic/hydrolytic processes of AD from methanogenesis. Acidogenesis {{can be combined}} with BioH 2 production, prior to methanogenesis. Depending on operating conditions and without further treatment after digestion, the methanogenic stage may discharge a digestate with significant organic strength including volatile fatty acids (VFAs). To meet wastewater discharge consents; adequate use of digestates on land; to minimise environmental impact and; enhance recovery of energy, VFAs should be low. Concatenating bioelectrochemical systems (BES) producing hydrogen and/or electricity can facilitate effluent polishing and improved energy efficiency. Various configurations of the BioH 2, methanogenesis and BES are plausible, and should improve the conversion of wet biomass to energy...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} the non-ruminant sector to self–sufficiency in meat and eggs has been matched by massive {{importation}} of feed. Thus, a major thrust to reduce the burden of feed imports {{is to increase the}} use of indigenous feed resources and intensify research to look for alternatives and substitutes. Over the past 3 decades, local researchers have reported on the availability nutritive content, optimal inclusion levels and treatment methods to enhance nutrient value of many locally available feed ingredients in practical poultry rations. The list includes evaluation and utilization of feed rice, palm kernel cake (PKC), broken rice, bran, sorghum, cassava, sago, fishmeal and commercial grain corn production; but the goal of import substitution and self- sufficiency is still unfulfilled. Although PKC, feed rice, local maize and specialty fats has potential to be viable energy feed sources and local fish meal is a promising protein feed source, more large scale Research and Development (R & D) is needed. In the ruminant sub-sector, emphasis is towards maximizing use of locally available <b>agro-industrial</b> byproducts and <b>crop</b> residues for the production of cost-effective feeds. The utilization of local feed resources is highly dependent on the supply of agro- industrial byproducts or crop residues from the oil palm and rice industries. In order to encourage a sustainable ruminant industry in Malaysia, local feed production has to be maximized and strengthened. Current emphasis is towards the development of practical and low-cost feeds for various classes of livestock species, particularly by utilizing local forages, tree fodders, <b>crop</b> residues and <b>agro-industrial</b> byproducts.
