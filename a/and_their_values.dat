2500|$|This early {{system was}} {{replaced}} by Greek numerals which employed the entire alphabet, including the nonstandard letters digamma, stigma, or sigma-tau (placed between epsilon and zeta), koppa (placed between pi and rho), and sampi (placed after omega). As revised in 2001, ELOT 743 provides for the uncommon characters to be given (in Greek) as $ for stigma, + for koppa, and / for sampi. These symbols are not given lower-case equivalents. When used as numbers, the letters are used {{in combination with the}} upper keraia numeral sign ⟨ʹ⟩ to denote numbers from 1 to 900 and in combination with the lower keraia ⟨͵⟩ to denote multiples of 1000.

2500|$|An {{attribute}} is a markup construct {{consisting of}} a name–value pair that exists within a start-tag or empty-element tag. An example is <img src="madonna.jpg" [...] alt="Madonna" [...] />, where {{the names of the}} attributes are [...] "src" [...] and [...] "alt", <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>values</b> are [...] "madonna.jpg" [...] and [...] "Madonna" [...] respectively. Another example is <step number="3">Connect A to B.</step>, where the name of the attribute is [...] "number" [...] and its value is [...] "3". An XML attribute can only have a single value and each attribute can appear at most once on each element. In the common situation where a list of multiple values is desired, this must be done by encoding the list into a well-formed XML attribute with some format beyond what XML defines itself. Usually this is either a comma or semi-colon delimited list or, if the individual values are known not to contain spaces, a space-delimited list can be used. <div class="inner greeting-box">Welcome!</div>, where the attribute [...] "class" [...] has both the value [...] "inner greeting-box" [...] and also indicates the two CSS class names [...] "inner" [...] and [...] "greeting-box".|$|E

For the performance, the group named themselves Yamakasi—Congolese Lingala ya makási, meaning strong in one's person, or [...] "strong man, strong spirit". Sébastien Foucan also invented a name for what they were doing: [...] "l'art du déplacement (French for [...] "the art of movement"). The firefighter performance caused {{both positive and negative}} attention. Some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it, such as their hard training <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>values</b> and ethics. Jean-François also sent pictures and video of {{the group to}} a French TV programme, and the popularity of parkour began to increase. A series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group, and they began to get more requests for performances. During this time, conflicting interests arose within the group. Sébastien Foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more, and David Belle had the ambition to become an actor. David and Sébastien chose to leave the group, and used the name [...] "parkour" [...] to describe their activity (see § Etymology above). The seven remaining Yamakasi members continued to use the term l'art du déplacement [...] (see § Derivative terminologies and disciplines below).|$|E
