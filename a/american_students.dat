When Greene, Long, and Williams enrolled in the fall semester of 1961, ANAK members discreetly kept a close watch on the three students for the first two weeks to ensure their safety. As a result of ANAK's efforts and those of other Institute and city organizations, none of the students was involved in any serious incident, paving the way for continued peaceful racial integration.|$|E

Moreover, it is a qualitative assessment that explores how Post- 9 / 11 Native <b>American</b> <b>Student</b> Veterans navigate the collegiate environment and balance their military and indigenous identities {{within the context of}} higher education. Through the individual voices of five Post- 9 / 11 Native <b>American</b> <b>Student</b> Veterans, {{the results of this study}} illustrate their decision-making processes, weighing of options, and reasons for sacrifice. Each individual had unique experiences, situations, and circumstances to consider before committing and transitioning into higher education. The confluences of situations and circumstances often determine the ability of Native <b>American</b> <b>Student</b> Veterans to engage, persist, and complete their academic endeavors; therefore, support systems are vital in helping them navigate and overcome obstacles. Respectfully, the experiences of Post- 9 / 11 Native <b>American</b> <b>Student</b> Veterans have the power to influence future generations and to clarify their options when transitioning from a military environment to a university environment. Moreover, the findings from these experiences can inform mainstream universities and Student Veteran Centers to strategically respond and develop support systems specifically designed to recruit, retain, and graduate Post- 9 / 11 Native <b>American</b> <b>Student</b> Veterans...|$|R

5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it is not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native <b>American</b> <b>students.</b> Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{also studied}} living languages, {{political}} economy, and public rights. The authors that most influenced him were Pedro Rodríguez de Campomanes, Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, Adam Smith, and François Quesnay. Belgrano translated Quesnay's book Maximes générales de gouvernement economique d'un royaume agricole (General Maxims of the Economical Government in an Agricultural Kingdom) to Spanish. His main {{interest in the}} works of such authors were ideas that referred to the public good and popular prosperity. Like many South <b>American</b> <b>students,</b> he became interested in physiocracy, which stated that new wealth came from nature, that agriculture was an economic activity that generated more income than one needed, and that the state should not interfere at all with it. By that time, South America had plenty of natural resources and a very strict state interventionism in the economy. Belgrano developed the idea that the principles of physiocracy and those stated by Adam Smith could be applied together in the viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. In the development of this approach he was influenced by Fernando Galliani, who promoted the study of particular cases over theoric generalisations, and Antonio Genovesi, who thought that the absolute freedom promoted by physiocrats should be tempered by a moderate intervention by the state, such as the provision of free education for some. During his time in Europe, Belgrano became president of an Academy within the University of Salamanca devoted to Roman legislation, forensic practice and political economy.|$|E
