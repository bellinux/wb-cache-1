25|$|Ethology is the {{scientific}} and objective study of animal behaviour, usually {{with a focus on}} behaviour under natural conditions, and viewing behaviour as an evolutionarily adaptive trait. Behaviourism is a term that also describes {{the scientific}} and objective study of animal behaviour, usually referring to measured responses to stimuli or trained behavioural responses in a laboratory context, without a particular emphasis on evolutionary <b>adaptivity.</b> Many naturalists have studied aspects of animal behaviour throughout history. Ethology has its scientific roots in the work of Charles Darwin and of American and German ornithologists of the late 19th and early 20th century, including Charles O. Whitman, Oskar Heinroth, and Wallace Craig. The modern discipline of ethology is generally considered to have begun during the 1930s with the work of Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and by Austrian biologists Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch, joint awardees of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science, with a strong relation to some other disciplines such as neuroanatomy, ecology, and evolutionary biology. Ethologists are typically interested in a behavioural process rather than in a particular animal group, and often study one type of behaviour, such as aggression, in a number of unrelated animals.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{show that}} this group is shaped by several forces. A major {{influence}} is the fact of frequent moves, as the family follows the military member-parent (or in some cases, both parents who are military members) who is transferred from military base to military base, each move usually being {{hundreds or thousands of}} miles in distance. Other shaping forces include a culture of resilience and <b>adaptivity,</b> constant loss of friendship ties, a facility or knack for making new friends, never having a hometown, and extensive exposure to foreign cultures and languages while living overseas or {{to a wide range of}} regional cultural differences due to living in a variety of different American regions. Additional influences include living in a series of military bases serving as community centers, the pervasive military culture on those bases, the absence of a parent due to deployments, the threat of parental loss in war, stresses associated with the psychological aftermath of war (living with war-affected returning veteran parents) and the militarization of the family unit (children being treated to some degree like soldiers and being subjected to military regimentation, inculcation into a warrior code of honor and service, frequent exposure to patriotic ideas and symbols, experience of free medical care, and military discipline). Military brats receive completely free medical care until their soldier-parent leaves the service (without a full combat related disability) or they reach the age of 21 or age 23 (depending on the parent's branch of service) if enrolled in college full-time.|$|E

5000|$|The Lagrangian-based <b>adaptivity</b> of SPH is {{analogous}} to the <b>adaptivity</b> present in grid-based adaptive mesh refinement codes. In some ways it is actually simpler because SPH particles lack any explicit topology relating them, unlike the elements in FEM. <b>Adaptivity</b> in SPH can be introduced in two ways; either by changing the particle smoothing lengths or by splitting SPH particles into 'daughter' particles with smaller smoothing lengths. The first method is common in astrophysical simulations where the particles naturally evolve into states with large density differences. [...] However, in hydrodynamics simulations where the density is often (approximately) constant this is not a suitable method for <b>adaptivity.</b> For this reason particle splitting can be employed, with various conditions for splitting ranging from distance to a free surface [...] through to material shear.|$|E

5000|$|The {{computational}} cost of {{the method}} scales not with the physical size of the system being simulated but {{with the amount of}} activity present in the simulation. Spatial <b>adaptivity</b> for certain problems reduces up to 80%.|$|E
50|$|An online {{model is}} related to the concept of {{real-time}} simulation, as an online model runs in real-time by definition. Conversely a real-time simulation is not necessarily an online model as it by definition does not require <b>adaptivity</b> in either states or parameters.|$|E
50|$|The system {{categories}} in which user modelling and <b>adaptivity</b> {{have been deployed}} by various researchers in the field share an underlying architecture. The conceptual structure for adaptive systems generally consists of interdependent components: a user model, a domain model and an interaction model.|$|E
50|$|As with computer-adaptive testing, this <b>adaptivity</b> maximises the {{efficiency}} of the estimation procedure, increasing the separation of the scores and reducing the standard errors. The most obvious advantage is that this produces significantly enhanced reliability, compared to assessment by marking, with no loss of validity.|$|E
5000|$|This {{analysis}} compellingly {{suggests that}} <b>adaptivity</b> significantly degrades IMM accuracy rather than improving it.

50|$|The <b>adaptivity</b> of {{the rate}} means that the duration, how long the screen content {{with one or more}} items are displayed, is varied by an {{algorithm}} until it matches the individual capacity of the test subject. The rate is the higher, the better the power of concentration.|$|E
50|$|For this reason, {{developers}} implement {{techniques of}} adaptation {{into the system}} in order to react to changing conditions as fast as possible. The example application scenario clearly shows an important distinction concerning such adaptation techniques: the differentiation between manually and automatically performed adaptation processes. Accordingly, the term adaptation decomposes into the two terms <b>adaptivity</b> and adaptability. <b>Adaptivity</b> indicates a system that adapts automatically to its users according to changing conditions, i.e. an adaptive system. Adaptability refers to users that can substantially customise the system through tailoring activities by themselves, i.e. an adaptable system. Adaptive and adaptable systems are complementary to each other. Both methods increase the match between user needs and system behaviour once {{the development of the}} system has been finished. Thus, the system is kept flexible during usage.|$|E
50|$|The last {{perspective}} {{is the extent}} to which education adequately responds to specific questions from the broader social-, cultural- and economic context. <b>Adaptivity</b> can be achieved by choosing objectives that meet the expectations from society. Because of the constant changes in society and the flow of new developments this requires flexibility.|$|E
