40|$|This {{classification}} {{is presented}} in two parts: (a) tumours of the gastrointestinal tract; and (b) tumours of the anal canal and margin. In the gastrointestinal tract the tumours are classified as adenoma, adenocarcinoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma, with several subtypes. Most polyps prove to be non-neoplastic, hyperplastic, or regenerative rather than <b>adenomatous.</b> <b>Carcinoma</b> of the stomach occurs mainly in dogs, but is a rare tumour {{in all parts of the}} world. Moderately differentiated, tubular adenocarcinoma of the small intestine with excessive fibrosis occurs in all six species; in some geographical locations it may occur frequently in sheep and cattle. The adenoma/carcinoma sequence in the rectum of the dog is similar to that in man but is encountered less often. Carcinoid tumours are very rare in domestic animals. Among the soft tissue tumours, those of smooth muscle and adipose tissue are found fairly frequently and congenital mesothelioma in the peritoneum of calves occurs occasionally. Tumours of the haematopoietic and related tissues are the most common gastrointestinal neoplasms in all species and most belong to the lymphosarcoma group. Tumours of the anal canal and margin are common in the dog and 90 % of these are tumours of the hepatoid (perianal) glands...|$|E
40|$|Alterations in {{the global}} {{methylation}} of DNA and in specific regulatory genes are two epigenetic alterations found in cancer. However, the significance of epigenetic changes for diagnosis and/or prognosis of colorectal cancer have not been established, {{although it has been}} extensively investigated. Recently we have identified a new type of cancer cell called precancerous stem cells (pCSCs) and proposed that cancer may arise from a lengthy development process of tumor initiating cells (TICs) → pCSCs → cancer stem cells (CSCs) → cancer, which is in parallel to histological changes of hyperplasia (TICs) → precancer (pCSCs) → carcinoma (CSCs/cancer cells), accompanied by clonal evolutionary epigenetic and genetic alterations. In this study, we investigated whether aberrant DNA methylation {{can be used as a}} biomarker for the differentiation between premalignant and malignant lesions in the colorectum. The profile of global DNA and estrogen receptor (ER) -α gene methylation during cancer development was determined by analysis of 5 -methylcytosine (5 -MeC) using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, dot blot analysis or a quantitative gene methylation assay (QGMA). Herein we show that global DNA hypomethylation and ER-α gene hypermethylation are progressively enhanced from hyperplastic polyps (HPs) → adenomatous polyps (APs) → <b>adenomatous</b> <b>carcinoma</b> (AdCa). The aberrant methylation can be completely reversed in APs, but not in AdCa by a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) celecoxib, which is a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase- 2 (Cox- 2), suggesting that the epigenetic alterations between colorectal precancer (AP) and cancer (AdCa) are fundamentally different in response to anti-cancer therapy. In normal colorectal mucosa, while global DNA methylation was not affected by aging, ER-α gene methylation was significantly increased with aging. However, this increase did not reach the level observed in colorectal APs. Taken together, reversibility of aberrant global DNA and ER-α gene methylation distinguishes colorectal precancer from cancer...|$|E
40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} one of the most common {{malignant}} tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. The development of this tumor is a complex, long-term, and multi-step process, from small dysplastic lesions of normal colorectal mucosa, through <b>adenomatous</b> polyps, to <b>carcinoma</b> in situ. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. MMP- 9 is able to degrade collagen IV from basement membranes and extracellular matrix, which is associated with tumor progression, including invasion, metastasis, growth, migration, and angiogenesis. It was demonstrated that increased expression of MMP- 9 plays a crucial role in the development of several human malignancies, including colorectal cancer. Increased expression of MMP- 9 correlated with tumor stage, invasiveness, and poor survival of colorectal cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|Personal interviews, {{tests for}} {{antibodies}} to {{herpes simplex virus}} type 2, Treponema pallidum, and hepatitis B, tests for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and polymerase chain reaction-based assays for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in cervical scrapings were obtained from 190 women with squamous cell and 42 women with <b>adenomatous</b> cervical <b>carcinoma</b> and from 291 hospitalized controls diagnosed in Bangkok, Thailand, between September 1991 and September 1993. Risk was strongly associated with oncogenic HPV types, with types 16 and 18 predominating in squamous and adenomatous lesions, respectively. The 126 cases with HPV- 16 and the 42 cases with HPV- 18 were compared with 250 controls with {{no evidence of any}} HPV. The risk of both viral tumor types increased with decreasing age at first intercourse in this predominantly monogamous population, which may be explained by more visits to prostitutes by the husbands of cases with early than late age at first intercourse. HPV- 16 tumors were weakly associated with HBsAg carrier state and smoking. The risk of tumors of both viral types increased with parity and use of oral contraceptives but not with injectable progestogens. Factors that may predispose to persistent, oncogenic HPV- 16 or- 18 infection may include estrogens or progestins in the presence of estrogens, immunosuppression, and smoking, but other factors related to low socioeconomic status are also involved.

40|$|Cancers exhibit {{abnormal}} molecular signatures {{associated with}} disease initiation and progression. Molecular signatures could improve cancer screening, detection, drug development and selection of appropriate drug therapies for individual patients. Typically only very {{small amounts of}} tissue are available from patients for analysis and biopsy samples exhibit broad heterogeneity that cannot be captured using a single marker. This report details application of an in-house custom designed GenomeLab System multiplex gene expression assay, the hCellMarkerPlex, to assess predictive gene signatures of normal, <b>adenomatous</b> polyp and <b>carcinoma</b> colon tissue using archived tissue bank material. The hCellMarkerPlex incorporates twenty-one gene markers: epithelial (EZR, KRT 18, NOX 1, SLC 9 A 2), proliferation (PCNA, CCND 1, MS 4 A 12), differentiation (B 4 GANLT 2, CDX 1, CDX 2), apoptotic (CASP 3, NOX 1, NTN 1), fibroblast (FSP 1, COL 1 A 1), structural (ACTG 2, CNN 1, DES), gene transcription (HDAC 1), stem cell (LGR 5), endothelial (VWF) and mucin production (MUC 2).

40|$|Two {{cases of}} {{superficial}} depressed type (IIc) early {{cancer of the}} colon are reported. Case 1 was a 65 -year-old male and case 2 a 69 -year old male. The lesion was located in the descending colon in both cases, and was removed by strip biopsy endoscopically in the former and surgically in the latter. The size of the lesion after resection was 6 mm in case 1 and 5 mm in case 2. Histopathologically, both cases were well differentiated adenocarcinoma without <b>adenomatous</b> components, and <b>carcinoma</b> developed de novo by submucosal (sm) invasion. As to the immunohistochemical staining of the cancer tissue by tumor associated antigen, case 1 showed a strong expression of carcinoembrionic antigen (CEA) and partial expression of sialyl Lewisx, and case 2 showed expressions of both CEA and sialyl Lewisx. The nuclear DNA content by flow cytometry was aneuploid only in case 1. Thus, although the two cases were morphologically the same IIc type cancer, the process of carcinogenesis and secondary phenomena varied...|$|R
40|$|Lung cancer {{remains the}} leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2007, more than 40, 000 people died from this disease in the Federal Republic of Germany alone. In general, lung tumors are {{classified}} as small cell (SCLC) or non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). Essentially, transgenic animal models are useful for an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tumourigenesis. Here we investigated three transgenic mouse models where targeted overexpression of the serine/threonine kinase c-raf, the transcription factor c-myc or the mitogen epidermal growth factor (EGF) was achieved by usage of a gene construct that contains regulatory sequences of the surfactant protein-C (SP-C) promotor. Animals thus overexpressed the transgene in alveolar-epithelial cells. We analyzed blood serum of transgenic animals and report proteome maps developed by twodimensional gel-electrophoresis (2 -DE) and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF). We identified biomarkers that are specific for atypic <b>adenomatous</b> hyperplasia, bronchiolo-alveolar <b>carcinomas</b> or papillary adenocarcinomas of the lung. The identification of novel candidate biomarkers by serum proteomics enables improved diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring of patients...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{study the}} {{expression}} of Ki- 67 and cytokeratin 20 (CK 20) {{in a group of}} hyperplastic polyps (including a group with “atypical ” features) with the aim of determining whether upper crypt Ki- 67 staining and lower crypt CK 20 staining correlated with these atypical features, as assessed by light microscopy. Methods: Fifty seven formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded hyperplastic colorectal polyps from 53 patients were selected on histological grounds; these comprised 26 typical polyps and 31 with atypi-cal features, which included nuclear hyperchromatism, basal crowding, and increased mitotic activity. These polyps were examined using a standard immunohistochemical method with antibodies against CK 20 and Ki- 67. Comparisons were made with normal mucosa, <b>adenomatous</b> polyps, and <b>carcinomas.</b> Results: Of the 26 typical polyps, 17 showed the usual pattern of lower crypt Ki- 67 and upper crypt CK 20 staining; one with upper crypt Ki- 67 staining but normal surface CK 20 staining; seven with Ki- 67 confined to the lower half of crypts but with scattered lower crypt CK 20; and one with both upper crypt Ki- 67 staining, together with scattered CK 20 basal staining. Of the 31 polyps with atypical features, 11 showed the usual staining pattern of lower crypt Ki- 67 staining and surface staining with CK 20; tw...|$|R
40|$|Carbonic anhydrase {{isoenzyme}} IX, MN/CA IX, is {{a recently}} discovered {{member of the}} carbonic anhydrase (CA) gene family with a suggested function in acid-base balance, intercellular communication, and cell proliferation. Increased expression of MN/CA IX has been observed with certain epithelial tumors. We investigated the expression of MN/CA IX in 69 colorectal neoplasms, consisting of 1 juvenile polyp, 8 hyperplastic polyps, 39 <b>adenomatous</b> lesions, 21 <b>carcinomas,</b> and 7 metastases. Tissue sections were immunostained with a monoclonal antibody specific to MN/CA IX. The proliferative activity of the tumor cells was evaluated by Ki- 67 antigen immunoreactivity. The hyperplastic polyps showed a weak or moderate reaction for MN/CA IX only in the cryptal epithelium, as did the normal intestinal mucosa. The adenomas showed immunoreactivity mainly in the superficial part of the mucosa, whereas the distribution in the carcinomas and metastases was more diffuse. Comparative immunostaining of serial sections for Ki- 67, a well established marker of cell proliferation, confirmed that MN/CA IX is expressed in areas with high proliferative capacity. Our results show abnormal MN/CA IX expression in colorectal neoplasms, suggesting its involvement in their pathogenesis. The co-occurrence of MN/CA IX and Ki- 67 in the same tumor cells indicates its potential {{for use as a}} marker of increased proliferation in the colorectal mucosa...|$|R
40|$|Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is {{a benign}} liver tumor that most {{frequently}} occurs in young women using oral contraceptives. We report a rare case of HCA in a 29 years old female with {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} (FAP). The first proband was her sister, who underwent a total colectomy and was genetically diagnosed as FAP. A tumor, 3. 0 cm in diameter, was detected in the right lobe of the liver during a screening study for FAP. A colonoscopy and gastroendoscopy revealed numerous <b>adenomatous</b> polyps without <b>carcinoma.</b> The patient underwent a total colectomy and ileo-anal anastomosis and hepatic posterior sectoriectomy. The pathological findings of the liver tumor were compatible with HCA. The resected specimen of the colon revealed multiple colonic adenomatous polyps. Examination of genetic alteration revealed a germ-line mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Inactivation of the second APC allele was not found. Other genetic alterations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha and &#x 3 B 2;-catenin gene, which are reported {{to be associated with}} HCA, were not detected. Although FAP is reported to be complicated with various neoplasias in extracolic organs, only six cases of HCA associated with FAP, including the present case, have been reported. Additional reports will establish the precise mechanisms of HCA development in FAP patients...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the cytomorphometric features in fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of thyroid lesions. Materials and Methods: FNAC of 36 thyroid cases was reviewed. The study included 10 cases each of follicular lesion, <b>adenomatous</b> goiter, papillary <b>carcinoma,</b> 4 cases of medullary carcinoma and 2 cases of anaplastic carcinoma. Their {{ages ranged from}} 28 to 50 years, and there were nine females and one male. Morphometric analysis was done on aspiration smears from 36 thyroid lesions. Hematoxylin and Eosin stained smears were examined using image analyzer Proplus V software. Morphological parameters measured included mean nuclear diameter, mean nuclear perimeter, mean nuclear area, circular rate, largest to smallest dimension ratio (LS ratio) and coefficient of variation of nuclear area (NACV). Statistical Analysis: Statistical evaluation was carried out using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test for the five variables, both within the group and in between the groups. The result was considered significant when P < 0. 05. Results: The follicular carcinomas had higher LS ratio than patients with adenomatous goiters. Mean nuclear diameter and the mean nuclear perimeter were higher in anaplastic carcinomas {{when compared to other}} subtypes and were the least for follicular neoplasms. Conclusion: When correctly applied, quantitative estimation of cytological nuclear features can {{play an important role in}} preoperative assessment and can complement morphological features in thyroid lesions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{concept of}} the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, as first espoused by Morson et al. whereby the {{development}} of colorectal cancer is dependent on a stepwise progression from <b>adenomatous</b> polyp to <b>carcinoma</b> is well documented. Initial studies of the genetics of inherited colorectal cancer susceptibility concentrated on the inherited colorectal cancer syndromes, such as Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and Lynch Syndrome (also known as HNPCC). These syn-dromes, whilst easily characterisable, have a well understood sequence of genetic mutations that predispose the sufferer to developing colorectal cancer, initiated for example in FAP {{by the loss of}} the second, normal allelle of the tumour supres-sor APC gene. Later research has identified other inherited variants such as MUTYH (MYH) polyposis and Hyperplastic Polyposis Syndrome. Recent research has concentrated on the pathways by which colorectal adenomatous polyps not due to one of these known inherited susceptibilities undergo malignant transformation, and determination of the types of polyps most likely to do so. Also, why do individuals in certain families have a predisposition to colorectal cancer. In this article, we will discuss briefly the current state of knowledge of the genomics of the classical inherited colorectal cancer syndromes. We will also discuss in detail the genetic changes in polyps that undergo malignant transformation as well as current knowledge with regards to the epigenomic changes found in colorectal polyps...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSixty-five {{people had}} a {{resection}} of their baseline screen-diagnosed lung cancers in the Early Lung Cancer Action Program. Forty-nine of the carcinomas were solitary, and 42 of these were adenocarcinomas. More than 1 carcinoma was found in 16 patients after pathologic examination of the lobectomy specimen; 15 of the 16 second carcinomas were adenocarcinomas, mixed subtype. Eighteen cases were submitted by local pathologists as Bronchioloalveolar carcinomas but {{were found to be}} invasive adenocarcinomas according to the World Health Organization classification by the Pathology Review Panel. Of the 65 resected cases, 57 were N 0, 7 were N 1, and 1 was N 2. Upon careful review of the lobectomy specimens, 49 cases had solitary malignancies, 30 were Stage IA, 13 Stage IB, 3 Stage IIA, 2 Stage IIB, and 1 Stage IIIA {{on the basis of the}} American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union for Cancer Control criteria. In the 16 cases found to have multiple malignancies, 6 had histologically different carcinomas and the remaining 10 had histologically identical malignancies. Eighty-three percent (76 / 92) of the carcinomas invaded the stroma with destruction of normal lung, and 21 % (19 / 92) also showed either pleural or angiolymphatic invasion, even though 88 % (57 / 65) of the carcinomas were free of lymph node metastases.

40|$|Insulin-like {{growth factor}} I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II) have {{been implicated in}} the {{replication}} of normal thyroid follicular cells in vitro. This study evaluates the distribution and abundance of immunoreactive IGF-I by histochemical analysis in human thyroid tissue with different histopathologic characteristics. We used two types of highly specific and sensitive polyclonal rabbit anti-IGF-l antibodies and one monoclonal antibody (MAb) with the immunoperoxidase technique on sections of 25 glands harboring adenomatous goiter; 11 glands with follicular adenoma (FA); 45 glands with thyroid carcinoma of papillary, follicular, and undifferentiated types; and 18 glands with Graves' disease. Immunoreactive IGF-I was present in some thyroid follicular cells of all thyroid tissues examined. the percentage of cells staining positively varies among the different processes, being lowest in normal thyroid tissues and highest in all thyroid carcinomas. the cytoplasmic pattern of IGF-I immunoreactivity also varied among the different thyroid conditions. Furthermore, using nonradioactive in situ hybridization (ISH) we detected IGF-I mRNA in the thyroid cells of adenomatous goiter. the expression was higher in the histologically hyperplastic areas. These findings provide further support for an autocrine and/or paracrine role of IGF-l in the function and/or growth of normal thyroid follicular cells and suggest that IGF-I {{may play a role}} in the dysfunctional growth of thyroid follicular cells in <b>adenomatous</b> goiter, thyroid <b>carcinoma,</b> and Graves' hyperthyroidism.

40|$|AIMS: Malakoplakia is a {{characteristic}} inflammatory condition {{which is usually}} seen in the urogenital tract. Gastrointestinal malakoplakia is seen in association {{with a variety of}} conditions such as ulcerative colitis, diverticular disease, <b>adenomatous</b> polyps and <b>carcinoma.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to report four additional cases of colorectal cancer associated with malakoplakia and review the literature on this association. METHODS: All specimens were colectomies for cancer. Routine handling of the specimen with lymph node harvesting was performed. In addition to HandE stains, PAS, Perls' Prussian Blue and von Kossa stains were performed. RESULTS: Three of the cases were encountered in males and the patients ranged in age from 55 to 64 years. One case each occurred in the caecum/ascending colon and descending colon, while the remaining two were located in the rectum. All four cases were Dukes' stage B tumours. Furthermore, all four cases had spread to pericolic fat and two had perforated. Microscopic examination showed the malakoplakia to be present at the infiltrating edge of the tumours. The draining lymph nodes were involved by malakoplakia to varying degrees in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: From this series and the literature review, malakoplakia associated with colorectal cancer tends to occur in elderly males in the rectum. The malakoplakia is found at the infiltrating front of the tumour and is not admixed with the neoplastic glands. Although lymph node involvement by malakoplakia has been reported only once previously, all four cases in this series showed evidence of involvement. The association does not appear to have any prognostic significance...|$|R
40|$|Ploidy {{studies in}} adenomatous polyps of colon I {{read the paper}} by Whitehead et al with great {{interest}} as their findings parallel some results, which Dr George Sledge and I have obtained with germ cell neoplasms of the testis. The conclusion that, "Dukes's (sic) A tumours which have invaded no farther than the bowel wall, if they are aneuploid, exhibit the less severe form (type 3) re-emphasises the importance of early recognition and removal of both <b>adenomatous</b> polyps and <b>carcinomas</b> of the colon " is misleading and {{not supported by the}} data in table 1. 1 It is inconsistent to construe that the difference between zero instances of type 4 histograms in stage A carcinomas, two instances in stage B, and one in stage C is meaningful {{and at the same time}} draw no conclusion from the observation that 11 of the 14 instances of type 1 histogram occurred in the tumours that had behaved most agressively. Thus from the data one might better con-clude that aneuploidy does not correlate well with neoplastic progression and aggressiveness in colonic epithelial neo-plasia. It seems to occur only in malignant neoplasms, but it could be argued that the data would support a concept that it is merely a side effect of the fundamental dis-order of growth, and perhaps even one which gets in the way. The same arguments apply to their con-clusions in the last paragraph that, "the findings in this study also support the view that the malignant process in cancer of the colon is a stepwise process. " Their conclu-sion, "There is clearly a case for ploidy stud-ies on all adenocarcinomas of the colon, especially with the technique used in this study, which is simple and cost effective [...] .," is also questionable as the technique entails much special equipment and software not available in most hospital pathology labora-tories and as their data do not show a cor-relation between ploidy and prognosis in colonic adenocarcinoma. Lastly, although the authors state in the discussion that " 25 of the 41 carcinomas examined were diploid " and (referring to textual citations of 15 cases of type 1 histo-gram, 10 cases of type 2, 13 cases of type 3, and 3 cases of type 4) that "Tables 1 and 2 summarise these results, " table I tabulates only 36 carcinomas altogether and shows only 24 of them as diploid.
