40|$|<b>Academic</b> <b>communication</b> and {{literacy}} {{have emerged as}} key elements in 21 st Century curricula. Indeed, the development of <b>academic</b> <b>communication</b> {{and literacy}} <b>skills</b> has been explicitly incorporated into international strategic curriculum change (Blackmore & Kandiko 2012). This cross-institutional symposium will discuss embedding <b>academic</b> <b>communication</b> and literacy within the curriculum and within disciplines in higher education. The main goal of the symposium will be to explore key issues and strategies around embedding, within the broad context of curriculum change and renewal. Although there is growing recognition that {{the most effective way}} to promote <b>academic</b> <b>communication</b> and literacy <b>skills</b> is to embed teaching and learning support for these skills into discipline-specific curricula, with academic language and learning specialists collaborating with discipline specialists, the challenges of embedded approaches are also recognised (Arkoudis & Starfield 2007). Apart from issues of funding and resources, a major challenge relates to the process of collaboration itself and difficulties related to differences in teaching philosophies, power relations and institutional priorities (Arkoudis & Starfield 2007). Involving a panel of academic language and learning specialists and discipline specialists from Murdoch, UWA and Curtin, the symposium will explore the opportunities and challenges of embedded approaches through individual mini-presentations and open discussion of key issues. Topics of individual mini-presentations will include: •	examples of successful embedding programs, such as Curtin University's Starting University Confidently and Competently English Support Scheme (SUCCESS); •	local and national initiatives, including Murdoch School of Education's initiative to develop core literacy concepts/attributes for Education and Carmela Briguglio's 'Embedding English Language Development into the Disciplines' OLT fellowship; •examples of institutional frameworks, such as UWA's Communications Skills Framework, developed as part of its New Courses 2012 initiative (CATL 2012). •Open discussion topics will include: •the role of communication skills/academic literacy in curriculum renewal; •key factors in successful collaborative partnerships between teaching and learning specialists and disciplinary specialists; •exploring shared understandings and the establishment of a common language to speak about academic literacy. A major goal of the symposium will be to engage audience participants in the discussion and to establish the basis for collaborations beyond the forum. It is hoped that the symposium will also contribute to the development of strategies for further promoting <b>academic</b> literacy and <b>communication</b> <b>skills</b> at Murdoch University and other institutions.

40|$|Despite {{industry}} {{demands for}} {{a high level of}} <b>communication</b> <b>skills</b> from university graduates, students are often resistant to studying, what they term as, ‘English’. Thus an important approach to learning and teaching of <b>academic</b> and professional <b>communication</b> <b>skills</b> is their integration with discipline-specific courses. In one Australian university, communication has been integrated with technical subjects in undergraduate degree programs. This interdisciplinary approach—whilst similar in some respects to other universities, both in Australia and overseas—is unique to this particular School in that the integration occurs across all four-year levels of undergraduate studies. The embedding of written, oral and team <b>communication</b> <b>skills</b> is based on constructivist theory—in particular, notions of both ‘spiral curriculum’ and scaffolded learning (Rose, Wood & Bruner 1974).

The academic labour market does not provide enough jobs and many PhD graduates will have a career outside academia. It has been questioned whether current PhD training trajectories are still adequate and collaborative research projects are introduced as alternative trajectories.

This article studies the effects of collaborative training trajectories on PhD skill development. We specifically focus on PhD students in multi-actor research programs (MARPs), an increasingly popular organizational form for facilitating transdisciplinary research activities. Using a survey among PhD students in MARPs and in traditional trajectories, we study the effects of a MARP on the development of four types of skills: (1) academic research skills, (2) <b>academic</b> <b>communication</b> <b>skills,</b> (3) translation and dissemination skills, and (4) transferable skills. Our findings suggest that collaborative training trajectories can indeed result {{in the development of a}} broader set of skills without negative effects on academic skill development.

40|$|The {{decline of}} the {{requisite}} linguistic skills of law students around {{the world has been}} documented comprehensively through legal scholarship. While ameliorating initiatives attempt to remedy law school education, the curriculization of English for academic legal purposes (EALP) has been neglected, resulting {{in the absence of a}} principled curricular framework for developing EALP syllabi. The proliferation of legal English communication across the circles of world English has accentuated the deterioration of students’ linguistic skills and exacerbated the educational challenges confronting law schools. These premises were influenced and validated by the researcher’s experiences as student and teacher of law and language. Three research questions address the rationale and guide the research: (1) Which curricular principles can be deduced from theoretical linguistics, second language (L 2) pedagogy, and legal education to constitute a framework for EALP? (2) Which legal linguistic skills clusters can be identified from a typology of EALP-type textbooks? (3) As research outcome, how can the literature review and textbook analysis be synthesized into a cohesive curricular framework for EALP that can be applied across the circles of world English? The cyclical research strategy that underpinned this qualitative study relied on a social constructionist worldview, case study methodology, and qualitative content analysis method. The literature review probed theoretical linguistics, L 2 pedagogy, and legal education as tributary disciplines of EALP. Insights gleaned from the literature review informed the qualitative content analysis of a purposive sample of EALP-type textbooks (N = 44). The textbooks were coded to create a typology and to determine the clusters of linguistic skills introduced during law school and across the circles of world English. The literature review led to the formulation of theoretically informed, curricular principles from the three disciplines that underpin EALP. The qualitative content analysis resulted in the creation of a typology of textbooks that exhibits clusters of linguistic skills that are scaffolded throughout law school. While <b>academic</b> <b>communication</b> <b>skills</b> were accentuated, legal linguistic skills incorporate additional clusters of thinking, research, and pedagogic skills. Together these skills constitute the skill of “thinking like a lawyer. ” A synthesis of the theoretical principles and skills clusters provides a holistic curricular framework for EALP that is sensitive to the local diversity within the circles of world English. The curricular framework for EALP draws legal English from the periphery to the center of law school education by accentuating the legal linguistic skills needed both in academia and in legal practice. The main limitations of the study are the challenges posed by the inclusion of original EALP syllabi and the manual coding of the textbook sample. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015.

The 28 children were assessed for outcomes between 9 to 53 months post-graduation from a birth-to- 3 early intervention (EI) program for children with hearing loss. Other factors {{included in the study}} were child’s hearing loss, mother’s education level, mother’s current <b>communication</b> <b>skills</b> with her child, and maternal use of additional services beyond those offered by the early intervention program or the child’s school program.

In <b>academics,</b> oral <b>communication</b> <b>skills</b> not only provide opportunities for students to practise and develop important communicative skills; these skills are also widely conversed in the attempt of improving themselves in the language. In higher education, these second language learners still face problems in the language mastery. Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate the problems pertaining learning English language and the learning strategies used as resolutions to reach the target goal by 134 first semester students at MARA University of Technology (UiTM) Sarawak. The study employed a survey design which involved administering questionnaires of five-point Likert scales ranging from 1 - 5, by adopting Rebecca Oxford's (1990) Strategy Inventory for Language Learning (SILL). Semi-constructed interview was also conducted to gain an in-depth understanding of the problems and the suitable learning strategies used by the students. The study revealed that the major problems faced by these students are; the lack of vocabulary, the low understanding of grammatical structure, confusion in using the correct usage of words, wrong pronunciation, the lack of confidence and less exposure to the English language. It was reported that cognitive strategies were the most frequently used. These strategies include manipulation or transformation of the language through reasoning, analysis, note taking, functional practice in naturalistic setting, as well as formal practice with structures and sounds.

With the aim of equipping students with attributes identified as important for Engineering graduates this paper presents a research project carried out at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China in the Division of Science &# 38; Engineering with Electrical and Electronic with undergraduate students, focusing on the use of a mixed specialist and non-specialist audience for students’ end of semester oral presentations assessment. It is known that oral presentations are an important <b>academic</b> genre developing <b>communication</b> <b>skills</b> and confidence in students but it is an area which {{has been found to be}} lacking in traditional engineering courses. The innovation of the mixed panel was to help prepare students for life after university by giving them experience of pitching technical material appropriate to the knowledge of the audience, which is something they will have to do when working in companies or on projects. This paper outlines the experience from the perspective of the assessors from different disciplines who were interviewed to determine what they were looking for in the presentations. It will also review the experience of the students themselves, based on a survey which considered the impact the mixed audience had on their presentation preparation in terms of language, presenting skills and content. This innovation in assessment encourages multi-disciplinary thinking in students and the impact of audience on presentation content and delivery is something which could be explored across different academic fields...|$|R
40|$|Aim: With the {{resolution}} from April 28, 2014, the Bavarian state government in Germany decided {{to found a}} new medical school at Augsburg University, thereby requiring {{the development of a}} competency-based medical curriculum. Methods: Two interdisciplinary groups developed a spiral curriculum (following Harden) employing the model of Thumser-Dauth & Öchsner. The curriculum focuses on specifically defined competencies: medical expertise, independent scientific reasoning, argumentation and scholarship, as well as <b>communication</b> <b>skills.</b> Results: The spiral curriculum was developed as a hybrid curriculum. Its modular structure incorporates the mandatory subjects required by the German regulations for medical licensure (Approbationsordnung) into organ- and system-centered blocks which are integrated both horizontally and vertically. Basic preclinical sciences are covered in the blocks “Movement,” “Balance” and “Contact. ” The clinical sciences are organized according to six pillars (conservative medicine, surgical medicine, men’s-women’s-children’s medicine, the senses, the nervous system and the mind, and general medicine) which students revisit three times each {{over the course of the}} program. A longitudinal clinical course incorporates interdisciplinary education. A particular focus is on scientific education encompassing a longitudinal course in the sciences (including interdisciplinary classes with other university departments), block practicums, and two scientific projects. Conclusion: It is not only the degree of integration und intensity of the Augsburg University undergraduate medical degree program, but also its targeted advancement of <b>academic,</b> social and <b>communication</b> <b>skills</b> that have not yet been realized to such an extent elsewhere in Germany. On July 8, 2016, the German Council of Science and Humanities unanimously gave this concept a positive evaluation. Future research will examine and evaluate the Augsburg medical curriculum and the impact of the new medical school on the hospital and university in Augsburg...|$|R
