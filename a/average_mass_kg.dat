5000|$|The {{southern}} reedbuck, rietbok [...] or common reedbuck (Redunca arundinum) is a diurnal antelope {{typically found}} in southern Africa. It was first described by Pieter Boddaert, a Dutch physician and naturalist, in 1785. It {{is placed in}} the genus Redunca and family Bovidae. This antelope has an <b>average</b> <b>mass</b> of 58 <b>kg</b> and a body length of about 134 - 167 cm.|$|R
5000|$|These {{subspecies}} have clean black-and-white banding {{without the}} brown shadow stripes of the Chapman's zebra subspecies. These are extended down the flanks {{and over the}} whole body except face and neck. The upper half is covered with horizontal stripes, mostly faded, that do not go around the legs. The belly is partly striped. Their <b>average</b> <b>mass</b> is 300 <b>kg,</b> and the average shoulder height is 59inches [...] Their track measures 121 mm x 89 mm.|$|R
50|$|Red forest duikers have a {{body length}} of up to 1 m, a typical {{shoulder}} height of 43 cm, and an <b>average</b> <b>mass</b> of 14 <b>kg.</b> Both sexes have short, straight horns about 6 cm long, although in females they may be smaller in size. Towards the base, the horns have coarse rings and longitudinal striations, but they are smooth towards the tips. The longest recorded length of horns for the red forest duiker is 11 cm.|$|R
5000|$|The {{member of}} this genus that best embodies the common name [...] "giant octopus" [...] is Enteroctopus dofleini, which holds the record of being the world's largest octopus based on direct {{measurements}} of a 71 kg individual, weighed live. This octopus had a total length near to 3.3 m. The remaining members of the genus are substantially smaller, with E. megalocyathus having an <b>average</b> <b>mass</b> of 4 <b>kg</b> and reaching a total length of 1.0 m. E. magnificus reaches a total length of around 1.5 m.|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{approximately}} 70 % of the re-entries of intact orbital {{objects are}} uncontrolled, corresponding to about 50 % of the returning mass, i. e. 100 metric tons per year. On average, {{there is one}} spacecraft or rocket body uncontrolled re-entry every week, with an <b>average</b> <b>mass</b> around 2000 <b>kg.</b> Even though a detailed demise analysis is available only occasionally, {{in many cases the}} alert casualty expectancy threshold of 1 : 10, 000 is probably violated. Re-entry predictions are affected by various sources of inevitable uncertainty and, in spite of decades of efforts, mean relative errors of 20 % often occur.

40|$|As obesity rates increase, the {{protection}} of obese occupants will become increasingly important in vehicle and restraint design. As {{a first step in}} this effort, this study seeks to compare the kinematics, dynamics, and injuries of obese post mortem human surrogates (PMHS) to (approximately) 50 th percentile adult male PMHS in frontal impact sled tests with a force-limiting, pre-tensioning restraint system. Forty-eight km/h, frontal impact sled tests were performed with a sled buck representing the rear seat occupant compartment of a 2004 mid-sized sedan. The restraint system consisted of a 3 -point belt with a pretensioner and a progressive force-limiter at the retractor. The test subjects were either obese PMHS or approximately 50 th percentile adult male PMHS. Instrumentation included accelerometer packages on the spine. Deformation of the subjects' chests were measured using chestbands placed nominally at the superior-inferior locations of the 4 th and 8 th ribs. Tension in the restraint system was measured at the upper shoulder belt, lower shoulder belt, and the lap belt. Motion of the head, shoulder, pelvis, and knee were recorded using high-speed video. Two obese PMHS (<b>average</b> <b>mass</b> 137 <b>kg,</b> <b>average</b> stature 186 cm) and three approximately mid-sized male PMHS (<b>average</b> <b>mass</b> 68 <b>kg,</b> <b>average</b> stature 176 cm) were tested. The obese PMHS exhibited significantly greater forward motion of the head and the pelvis compared to the mid-sized PMHS. The obese PMHS also exhibited backwards torso rotation at the time of maximum forward excursion, whereas the mid-sized PMHS did not. The obese PMHS exhibited average maximum chest compressions of approximately 44 % (± 9 % standard deviation) of their initial chest depths, and exhibited 26 g (± 2 g) average 3 ms clip maximum chest resultant acceleration. In comparison, the mid-sized PMHS exhibited averages of 29 % (± 9 %) maximum chest compression and 35 g (± 4 g) maximum 3 ms clip chest acceleration. The obese PMHS exhibited 7 and 2 rib fractures, with maximum chest AIS scores of 3 and 2. The mid-sized PMHS exhibited 12, 2, and 17 rib fractures, with maximum chest AIS scores of 4, 1, and 4, respectively. This study is the first (to the authors' knowledge) to compare the kinematic, dynamic, and injury behaviors of obese and mid-sized PMHS in frontal impact sled tests with a force-limiting, pretensioning restraint system. The unfavorable kinematics observed with the obese PMHS highlights the difficulty of designing restraint systems to adequately restrain obese occupants, even with currently available advanced restraint technologies...|$|R
5000|$|This {{is one of}} {{the largest}} species of Buteo. Length can range from 50 to 66 cm and {{wingspan}} from 115 to 160 cm. Females, at an <b>average</b> <b>mass</b> of 1.3 <b>kg,</b> are larger than males, at an average of 1.1 kg. There are many different colour forms, but usually long-leggeds have a clear orange tint to the plumage, red or orange tail, pale head and largely white underwings. There is usually a distinctive black carpal patch and dark trailing edge to the wing. The rump and [...] "trousers" [...] are often dark or deep rufous. Plumage varies from ghostly pale individuals to very dark ones. Some plumages are almost similar to those of the steppe buzzard, the eastern subspecies of the common buzzard (Buteo buteo vulpinus), but long-legged buzzards have longer wings and are more like rough-legged buzzards or even a small Aquila eagle.|$|R
50|$|In {{the state}} of California, studies have {{indicated}} that the <b>average</b> <b>mass</b> is 86 <b>kg</b> in adult males and 58 kg in adult females. Adult black bears in Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge in east-central Alaska were found to average 87.3 kg in males and 63.4 kg in females, whereas on Kuiu Island in southeast Alaska (where nutritious salmon are readily available) adult bears averaged an estimated 115 kg. In Great Smoky Mountains National Park, adult males averaged 112 kg and adult females averaged 47 kg per one study. In Yellowstone National Park, a population study found that adult males averaged 119 kg and adult females averaged 67 kg. In New York state, the two sexes reportedly average 135 kg and 74 kg, respectively. Adults typically range from 120 to 200 cm in head-and-body length, and 70 to 105 cm in shoulder height. The typically small tail is 7.7 - 17.7 cm long. Although they are the smallest species in North America, large males exceed the size of other bear species except the brown bear and polar bears.|$|R
50|$|The gopher {{tortoise}} is {{a fairly}} large terrestrial reptile which possesses forefeet well adapted for burrowing, and elephantine hind feet. These features are common to most tortoises. The front legs have scales to protect the tortoise while burrowing. They are dark brown to gray-black in overall color, with a yellow plastron (bottom shell). A gular projection is evident on the anterior plastron where the head projects out from the shell. Sexual dimorphism is evident, with male gopher tortoises having concave plastrons, while those of females are flat. In addition, the gular projection on male plastrons is generally longer than in females. Carapace length can range from 20 to 30 cm, with a height (to {{the peak of the}} shell at the middle of the body) of 15 - 37 cm. Body <b>mass</b> <b>averages</b> 4 <b>kg,</b> with a range of 2 - 6 kg.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to develop and {{validate}} a system for the telemetric measurement of in vivo compressive intervertebral loads in the sheep, and to measure these loads in a variety of activities. A miniature load cell and radio transmitter were implanted in the L 3 [...] L 4 space of the spine. A total of four sheep were operated on; one was sacrificed five days after surgery, due to failure of the transmitter, and another was sacrificed after failing to ambulate for two weeks after surgery. The other two animals (<b>average</b> <b>mass</b> 67 <b>kg)</b> were kept for five weeks, during which a range of activities were performed, including standing, lying prone, walking/trotting, and jumping. Results for a range of activities were as follows: in walking at 1. 5 m/s, average maximum and minimum loads were 461 N and 256 N, respectively; in walking at 2 m/s, average maximum and minimum loads were 684 N and 303 N, respectively; in standing, loads averaged 161 N; and in lying prone, loads averaged 212 N. The highest loads were recorded in jumping, where the peak load was 1290 N. The results of this study demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, the magnitude of in vivo axial loads in the sheep lumbar spine. These findings have implications for the evaluation of studies which employ the sheep model to test spinal implants. As treatment methods for disc degeneration progress from the spacer and fusion approach to more sophisticated prostheses and tissue engineered disc replacements which preserve segmental mobility, such data will become even more important to the design, animal testing, and evaluation of implants...|$|R
40|$|The biobaler is an {{alternative}} to the modified self-propelled forage harvester to cut and collect short rotation woody crops (SRWC). It is less capital intensive and more versatile, being able to harvest woody crops on plantations, on abandoned farmland, on brush land or within forest understory. The biobaler was evaluated specifically on five different plantations over 19 experimental units (546 bales harvested with an <b>average</b> <b>mass</b> of 427 <b>kg</b> and 49 % moisture content). Average bale density was 266 <b>kg</b> wet <b>mass</b> (WM) /m 3 or 139 <b>kg</b> dry <b>mass</b> (DM) /m 3. Average harvest capacity was 35 bales/h (7. 7 t dry matter/h), and ranged from 23 to 48 bales/h. Harvest in plantations with a 149 kW tractor cost on average CAN $ 175 /h, $ 5 /bale and $ 22. 84 /t DM. Non recovered biomass (field loss) averaged 11 % at random locations in the field and 8 % at the point of bale ejection as a result of chip abrasion. While the biobaler remains a versatile harvester for SRWC, its preferred utilization will be in environments of diverse woody crops with final application as a rough mulch or for combustion in furnaces requiring minimal processing or size reduction. </p...|$|R

50|$|Manatees have {{a mass of}} 400 to 550 kg, {{and mean}} length of 2.8 to 3.0 m, with maxima of 4.6 m and 1775 kg seen (the females tend to be larger and heavier). When born, baby {{manatees}} have an <b>average</b> <b>mass</b> of 30 <b>kg.</b> They have a large, flexible, prehensile upper lip. They use the lip to gather food and eat, as well as using it for social interactions and communications. Manatees have shorter snouts than their fellow sirenians, the dugongs. Their small, widely spaced eyes have eyelids that close in a circular manner. The adults have no incisor or canine teeth, just a set of cheek teeth, which are not clearly differentiated into molars and premolars. These teeth are continuously replaced throughout life, with new teeth growing at the rear as older teeth fall out from farther forward in the mouth. This process is known as polyphyodonty and amongst the other mammals, only occurs in the kangaroo and elephant. At any given time, a manatee typically has {{no more than six}} teeth in each jaw of its mouth. Its tail is paddle-shaped, and is the clearest visible difference between manatees and dugongs; a dugong tail is fluked, similar in shape to a that of a whale. Females have two teats, one under each flipper, a characteristic that was used to make early links between the manatee and elephants.|$|R
50|$|The {{mandrill}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} sexually dimorphic mammals due to extremely strong sexual selection which favors males in both size and coloration. Males typically weigh 19 - 37 <b>kg,</b> with an <b>average</b> <b>mass</b> of 32.3 <b>kg.</b> Females weigh roughly half as much as the male, at 10 - 15 kg and an average of 12.4 kg. Exceptionally large males can weigh up to 54 kg, with unconfirmed reports of outsized mandrills weighing 60 kg per the Guinness Book of World Records. The mandrill is the heaviest living monkey, somewhat surpassing even the largest baboons such as chacma baboon and olive baboons in average weight even considering its more extreme sexual dimorphism, but the mandrill averages both shorter in the length and height at the shoulder than these species. The average male is 75 - 95 cm long and the female is 55 - 66 cm, with the short tail adding another 5 - 10 cm. The shoulder height while on all fours can range from 45 - 50 cm in females and 55 - 65 cm in males. Compared to the largest baboons, the mandrill is more ape-like in structure, with a muscular and compact build, shorter, thicker limbs that are longer in the front and almost no tail. Mandrills can live up to 31 years in captivity. Females reach sexual maturity at about 3.5 years.|$|R

5000|$|From the {{perspective}} of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, a larger amount of ordinary (baryonic) matter implies a denser early universe, more efficient conversion of matter to helium-4, and less unburned deuterium remaining.

This could be resolved if more deuterium were somehow generated, but large efforts in the 1970s failed to identify plausible mechanisms for this to occur.
