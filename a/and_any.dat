5|$|A non-safety fougasse {{could be}} built by simply burying the {{propelling}} charge behind the fuel drum and running leads through the soil.

5|$|According to Gandhi, {{religion}} {{is not about}} what a man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god.

25|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement. The psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values, <b>and</b> permit <b>any</b> one-to-one transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values, <b>and</b> permit <b>any</b> order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in Celsius or Fahrenheit), <b>and</b> permit <b>any</b> linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, <b>and</b> permit <b>any</b> rescaling transformation.|$|R

5|$|Among {{the lighter}} elements, fluorine's {{abundance}} value of 400ppb (parts per billion) – 24th among {{elements in the}} universe – is exceptional: other elements from carbon to magnesium are twenty or more times as common.

A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play.

If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out <b>and</b> <b>any</b> runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E
