5|$|Ensuring a plasmid accepts <b>an</b> <b>insert</b> is {{a common}} problem of DNA cloning. Toxin-antitoxin systems {{can be used to}} {{positively}} select for only those cells that have taken up a plasmid containing the inserted gene of interest, screening out those that lack the inserted gene. An example of this application comes from CcdB-encoded toxin, which has been incorporated into plasmid vectors. The gene of interest is then targeted to recombine into the CcdB locus, inactivating the transcription of the toxic protein. Thus, cells containing the plasmid but not the insert perish due to the toxic effects of CcdB protein, and only those that incorporate the insert survive.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{release was}} titled Live in Japan and {{featured}} a unique sleeve design, with an overhead stage {{shot of the}} band, a selection of photographs from a gig at the Rainbow Theatre in London, and <b>an</b> <b>insert</b> with lyrics and a hand-written message from each band member. The first pressing came with a 35mm film negative with photos of the band which buyers could develop into their own prints. The sleeve notes claimed that the recording only contained the Tokyo gig, though {{in fact it was}} musically identical to the version released {{in the rest of the}} world. Phil Collen, later to play in Def Leppard, was in the audience for the Rainbow gig as captured on the sleeve.|$|E
5|$|The car {{scene with}} Gillian Anderson and Annabeth Gish {{was shot at}} Kanan Road, Malibu. Anderson and Gish sat in {{what is known as}} <b>an</b> <b>insert</b> car, while the crew sat in a pickup car in front of them. The birth scene was filmed at the old Paramount Movie Ranch. According to {{director}} Kim Manners, the most difficult scene to shoot was in the elevator with Mitch Pileggi and Nicholas Lea. Gish had never worked much with guns before joining The X-Files cast, so the producers got a retired LAPD officer to teach her more about firearms. She did some shooting practices before returning to the set. The FBI garage scenes were shot in Century City and took a total of four days to finish.|$|E

5|$|According to <b>an</b> <b>insert</b> in the Lady and the Tramp Diamond Edition release case, Aladdin {{was going}} to be {{released}} on Blu-ray Disc as a Diamond Edition in Spring 2013. Instead, Peter Pan was released on Blu-ray as a Diamond Edition on February 5, 2013 to celebrate its 60th anniversary. A non-Diamond Edition Blu-ray was released in a few select European countries in March 2013. The Belgian edition (released without advertisements, commercials or any kind of fanfare) comes as a 1-disc version with its extras ported over from the Platinum Edition DVD. The same disc was released in the United Kingdom on April 14, 2013. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on a Diamond Edition Blu-ray on October 13, 2015. The film was released on Digital HD on September 29, 2015. Upon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film topped the Blu-ray Disc sales chart and debuted at number 2 at the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales behind the disaster film San Andreas.|$|E
5|$|After 18 to 24 {{months of}} development, Maniac Mansion debuted at the 1987 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was {{released}} for the Commodore 64 and Apple II in October 1987. While previous Lucasfilm Games products {{had been published}} by outside companies, Maniac Mansion was self-published. This became a trend at Lucasfilm. The company hired Ken Macklin, an acquaintance of Winnick's, to design the game's packaging artwork. Gilbert and Winnick collaborated with the marketing department to design the back cover. The two also created <b>an</b> <b>insert</b> that includes hints, a backstory, and jokes. An MS-DOS port was released in early 1988, developed in part by Lucasfilm employees Aric Wilmunder and Brad Taylor. Ports for the Amiga, Atari ST and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) followed, with the Amiga and Atari ST ports in 1989 and the NES port in 1990. The 16-bit versions of Maniac Mansion featured a copy protection system requiring the user to enter graphical symbols out of a code book include with the game. This was not present in the Commodore 64 and Apple versions {{due to lack of}} disk space, so those instead used an on-disk copy protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the single's US picture sleeve {{consisted}} of a photo of Harrison playing guitar inside the central tower of his recently purchased home, Friar Park, in Henley-on-Thames. The tower's sole, octagonal-shaped room was an area that Harrison had adopted as his personal temple and meditation space. This picture was taken by photographer Barry Feinstein, whose Camouflage Productions partner, Tom Wilkes, originally used {{it as part of}} an elaborate poster intended as <b>an</b> <b>insert</b> in the album package. The poster featured a painting of the Hindu deity Krishna watching a group of naked maidens beside a bathing pond. Harrison apparently felt uncomfortable with the symbolism in Wilkes's design – the Friar Park tower image filled {{the top half of the}} poster, floating among clouds above the Krishna scene – so Wilkes abandoned the concept and instead used a darkened photo of Harrison inside the house as the album poster. The more common picture sleeve internationally was a close-up of Feinstein's All Things Must Pass front-cover image, taken on the main lawn of Friar Park. In Denmark, the sleeve featured four shots of Harrison, again with guitar, taken on stage during the Delaney & Bonnie tour.|$|E

For {{the first six}} months, this journal appeared as <b>an</b> <b>insert</b> in the New York Review of Books, but it became an independent publication in 1980.

In June 1975 he appeared alongside his son, Damon Hill, on the popular television programme Jim'll Fix It.

25|$|Each {{isometric}} monomer is structurally {{organized into}} 8 distinct domains consists of; a leucine-rich repeat domain (L1, residues 1-157), a cysteine-rich region (CR, residues 158-310), an additional leucine rich repeat domain (L2, residues 311-470), three fibronectin type III domains; FnIII-1 (residues 471-595), FnIII-2 (residues 596-808) and FnIII-3 (residues 809-906). Additionally, <b>an</b> <b>insert</b> domain (ID, residues 638-756) resides within FnIII-2, containing the α/β furin cleavage site, from which proteolysis results in both IDα and IDβ domains. Within the β-chain, downstream of the FnIII-3 domain lies a transmembrane helix (TH) and intracellular juxtamembrane (JM) region, just upstream of the intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) catalytic domain, responsible for subsequent intracellular signaling pathways.|$|E
25|$|Splitter: A {{splitter}} or {{riving knife}} is a vertical projection located behind the saw blade. This {{can be a}} pin or a fin. It is slightly narrower in width than the blade and located directly {{in line with the}} blade. The splitter prevents the material being cut from being rotated thereby helping to prevent kickback. Splitters may incorporate pawls, a mechanism with teeth designed to bite into wood and preventing kickback. Splitters can take many forms, including being part of the blade guard that comes standard with the saw. Another type of splitter is simply a vertical pin or fin attached to <b>an</b> <b>insert.</b> Splitters are available commercially or can be made from wood, metal or plastic.|$|E

25|$|We felt keenly {{that while}} the miraculous events of the {{founding}} of the State of Israel had found fitting expression {in the other Conservative siddurim} the more difficult experience of the Holocaust had yet to find an appropriate place in our prayers, Therefore, we composed a Nahum prayer for Yom Ha-shoah, inspired by that which appeared in Siddur Va-ani Tefillati of the Masorti Movement in 1998. In <b>an</b> <b>insert</b> into the Amidah, similar to that used traditionally on Tisha B'Av, we seek God's comfort in light of our people's losses in Europe during the Holocaust. We felt the need, beyond that, to acknowledge on a daily basis the enormous effect that the Holocaust has had upon our people. At the end of Tahanun papers, in a prayer which reflects our suffering, we added reference to the anguish we still feel.|$|E
