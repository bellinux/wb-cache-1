40|$|With the {{increased}} availability of regional reference networks, Precise Point Positioning (PPP) can achieve fast ambiguity resolution (AR) and precise positioning by assimilating the satellite fractional cycle biases (FCBs) and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>corrections</b> derived from these networks. In such processing, the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>corrections</b> are usually treated as deterministic quantities. This is however unrealistic since the estimated <b>atmospheric</b> <b>corrections</b> {{obtained from the}} network data are random and furthermore the interpolated corrections diverge from the realistic corrections. This paper {{is dedicated to the}} stochastic modelling of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>corrections</b> and analyzing their effects on the PPP AR efficiency. The random errors of the interpolated corrections are processed as two components: one is from the random errors of estimated corrections at reference stations, while the other arises from the atmospheric delay discrepancies between reference stations and users. The interpolated <b>atmospheric</b> <b>corrections</b> are then applied by users as pseudo-observations with the estimated stochastic model. Two data sets are processed to assess the performance of interpolated corrections with the estimated stochastic models. The results show that when the stochastic characteristics of interpolated corrections are properly taken into account, the successful fix rate reaches 93. 3 % within 5 min for a medium inter-station distance network and 80. 6 % within 10 min for a long inter-station distance network...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} various functional {{models of the}} Ordinary Kriging (OK) technique in order to precisely estimate epoch-by-epoch <b>atmospheric</b> <b>corrections</b> for real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning. A network of Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) in New South Wales (NSW), known as CORSnet-NSW, is utilised to: 1) obtain atmospheric residuals per reference station, 2) construct an empirical variogram over the network, 3) determine Kriging parameters for three different models: a spherical-, an exponential-, and a Gaussian model; and 4) optimise the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>corrections</b> for RTK users. Applying the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>corrections</b> based on the Kriging functional models, “synthetic ” measurements at a given virtual reference station (VRS) are generated and used for RTK positioning. A test with a 21 km baseline VRS-RTK indicates that less than 2 cm of horizontal errors (1 sigma) and 7 cm of vertical errors (1 sigma) are achieved.

40|$|SUMMARYNew {{automated}} “long range” {{total stations}} are actually available for monitoring landslides, dams, structures etc. The use of total station is consolidate within some hundred meters of distance {{and with a}} supervisor. But the long range (up to 3 km) measurements are not still completely investigated in operating condition. When the accuracy and the precision required are important, seems to be necessary to investigate the atmosphere influence on distance measurements. The research deals with the study of a landslide topographic monitoring system: the Collagna Landslide (Reggio Emilia, Italy) monitoring system. It consists of an automated long range total station acquiring about 36 prisms,every 4 hours, since 2009. The idea was to test how <b>atmospheric</b> <b>corrections</b> could improve the measurements precision and accuracy to exploit the system capabilities.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to {{retrieve}} the land surface bidirectional reflectivity rho(b) in the mid-infrared (MIR) from MODIS channels 22 and 23. A split-window-like algorithm was developed to determine the MIR ground brightness temperature T(g) (0) without {{the contribution of the}} solar direct beam from ground brightness temperatures measured at two adjacent MIR channels. Comparing the actual values of rho(b) with those estimated using our proposed method, the root mean square error (RMSE) was determined to be 0. 0022 for the solar zenith angle (SZA) at nadir. Similar results were obtained for other SZAs, indicating that the proposed method can retrieve b accurately. A detailed sensitivity analysis found that the effects of instrumental noise, variations in water vapour content in the atmosphere, and reasonable variations in horizontal visibility on the retrieval of rho(b) were negligible and an error of 1 K on the ground brightness temperature caused by the inaccuracy of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>corrections</b> can lead to a maximum error of 0. 034 on the retrieved rho(b). We compared the use of radiosonde data and European Centre for Median-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) atmospheric data to perform <b>atmospheric</b> <b>corrections.</b> The results show that <b>atmospheric</b> <b>corrections</b> can be performed with ECMWF data instead of radiosonde data without losing the accuracy of the retrieved rho(b).

50|$|Light {{reflected}} {{from the}} sub-surface ocean is called water-leaving radiance {{and is used}} to estimate chlorophyll concentrations. However, only about 5-10% of light {{at the top of}} the atmosphere is from water-leaving radiance. The remainder of light is reflected from the atmosphere and from aerosols within the atmosphere. In order to estimate chlorophyll concentrations this non-water-leaving radiance must be accounted for. Some light reflected from the ocean, such as from whitecaps and sun glint, must also be removed from chlorophyll calculations since they are representative ocean waves or the angle of the sun instead of the subsurface ocean. The process of removing these components is called <b>atmospheric</b> <b>correction.</b>|$|E
40|$|Differential {{illumination}} effects {{complicate the}} interpretation and classification of satellite imagery in mountain areas. Different topographic correction methods ranging from simple empirical to complex physically-based {{models have been}} developed to quantify and remove differential illumination effects from the recorded reflectance values. However, the preprocessing of satellite imagery requires additional input data and complicates the design of automatic classification process chains for large scale mapping. It is at present not clear what the relative added value of <b>atmospheric</b> and topographic <b>correction</b> techniques is. This study compares the influence of 2 atmospheric and 4 topographic correction methods on two Landsat-TM images in the Romanian Carpathian mountains. The results show that <b>atmospheric</b> <b>corrections</b> improve the images substantial in flat regions. However, in mountain areas, the influence of topographic corrections is more important than <b>atmospheric</b> <b>corrections.</b> The empirical topographic correction methods based on band ratioing and cosine corrections do not significantly improve the results (Figure). Topographic correction methods based on a pixel-based Minnaert procedures and physically-based methods such as the integrated radiometric correction (IRC) do improve the results significantly but their parameterization impedes automation in classification process chains. The combined application of <b>atmospheric</b> and topographic <b>correction</b> techniques improves the accuracy of land cover mapping significantly and allows to distinguish more land cover classes with an acceptable class purity.

50|$|From a satellite, a proxy {{measurement}} of the water turbidity {{can be made by}} examining the amount of reflectance in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. For the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the logical choice is band 1, covering wavelengths 580 to 680 nanometres, the orange and red. In order to make derived products that are comparable over time and space, an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>correction</b> is required. To do this, the effects of Rayleigh scattering are calculated based on the satellite viewing angle and the solar zenith angle and then subtracted from the band 1 radiance. For an aerosol correction, band 2 in the near infrared is used. It is first corrected for Rayleigh scattering and then subtracted from the Rayleigh corrected band 1. The Rayleigh corrected band 2 is assumed to be aerosol radiance because no return signal from water in the near infrared is expected since water is highly absorbing at those wavelengths. Because bands 1 and 2 are relatively close on the electromagnetic spectrum, we can reasonably assume their aerosol radiances are the same.|$|E
50|$|Spectral data {{acquired}} by satellite sensors {{are influenced by}} a number of factors, such as atmospheric absorption and scattering, sensor-target-illumination geometry, sensor calibration, and image data processing procedures, which tend to change through times (Teillet, 1986). Targets in multi-date scenes are extremely variable and have been nearly impossible to compare in an automated mode (Kim and Elman, 1990). In order to detect genuine landscape changes as revealed by changes in surface reflectance from multi-date satellite images, it is necessary to carry out radiometric correction. Two approaches to radiometric correction are possible: absolute and relative (Lo and Yang, 1998). The absolute approach requires the use of ground measurements at the time of data acquisition for <b>atmospheric</b> <b>correction</b> and sensor calibration. This is not only costly but also impractical when archival satellite image data are used for change analysis (Hall et al., 1991). The relative approach to radiometric correction, known as relative radiometric normalization (RRN), is preferred because no in-situ atmospheric data at the time of satellite overpasses are required. This method involves normalizing or rectifying the intensities or digital numbers (DN) of multi-date images band-by-band to a reference image selected by the analyst. The normalized images would appear as if they were acquired with the same sensor under similar atmospheric and illumination conditions to those of the reference image.|$|E
