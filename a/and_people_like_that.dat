500|$|Jagger and Richards {{shared an}} admiration of Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Little Walter, which {{influenced}} Brian Jones, of whom Richards says, [...] "He was more into T-Bone Walker and jazz blues stuff. We'd turn him onto Chuck Berry and say, 'Look, it's {{all the same}} shit, man, {{and you can do}} it.'" [...] Charlie Watts, a traditional jazz drummer, [...] was also introduced to the blues through his association with the pair. [...] "Keith and Brian turned me on to Jimmy Reed <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I learned that Earl Phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer, playing swing, with a straight four." [...] Jagger, recalling when he first heard the likes of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Fats Domino, and other major American R artists, said it [...] "seemed the most real thing" [...] he had heard up to that point. Similarly, Keith Richards, describing the first time he listened to Muddy Waters, said it was the [...] "most powerful music [...] ever heard... the most expressive." [...] He also stated, [...] "when you think of some dopey, spotty seventeen year old from Dartford, who wants to be Muddy Waters—and {{there were a lot of}} us—in a way, very pathetic, but in another way, very... heartwarming".|$|E

Robinson carried pictures of Temple with him wherever he traveled, and Temple considered him a lifelong friend, saying in an interview [...] "Bill Robinson treated me as an equal, which was very important to me.

He's one of the reasons why we've had the hits that we've had." ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of his death, many {{community}} leaders paid tribute to Barry's contributions to the Province of New Brunswick.

5000|$|These [...] "Four Cold Warriors", {{who each}} contributed in {{important}} ways to the nuclear arms race, built on classical deterrence theory, now argue that we must eliminate all nuclear weapons or face disaster on an enormous scale. Former Secretary Kissinger puts the new danger this way: [...] "The classical notion of deterrence {{was that there was}} some consequences before which aggressors and evildoers would recoil. In a world of suicide bombers, that calculation doesn’t operate in any comparable way".

5000|$|Some {{analysts have}} argued that nuclear weapons have made the world {{relatively}} safer, with peace through deterrence and through the stability-instability paradox, including in south Asia. Kenneth Waltz has argued that nuclear weapons have helped keep an uneasy peace, and further nuclear weapon proliferation might even help avoid the large scale conventional wars that were so common before their invention {{at the end of}} World War II. But former Secretary Henry Kissinger says there is a new danger, which cannot be addressed by deterrence: [...] "The classical notion of deterrence was that there was some consequences before which aggressors and evildoers would recoil.

5000|$|Born in Los Angeles, California, Gans {{started out}} as a {{musician}} in 1970, playing guitar and writing songs and performing both as a soloist and as a member of various bands around the San Francisco Bay Area. Then, in an unusual career change, he became a music journalist. Gans' journalism career was quite successful, writing for BAM, a free San Francisco-based magazine, and Jann Wenner's Record from its beginning to its end, and working as music editor of Mix magazine for a while. He wrote articles for prominent magazines such as Relix and Rolling Stone. He commented, [...] "Writing for music magazines gave me access to musicians and producers and record company publicists. I got a million-dollar education from interviewing Leo Fender, Randy Newman, Fleetwood Mac, Steve Goodman, T Bone Burnett, Warren Zevon, Ted Templeman, <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I spent time in recording studios, learned how the music business operates, rode in limos with the Doobie Brothers, got lots of records for free, and got paid for all of it." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, The Walt Disney Company {{began to}} {{consider}} producing {{a sequel to}} The Nightmare Before Christmas, but rather than using stop motion, Disney wanted to use computer animation.

[...] "You know, 'Jack visits Thanksgiving world' or other kinds of things just because I felt the movie had a purity to it <b>and</b> the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>like</b> it...

5000|$|Garber {{grew up in}} Miami, the {{youngest}} of three children of a lawyer father and a cooking-school owner mother. She did some modeling from ages 4 to 13, and {{always wanted to be}} a performer. Garber told TV Guide in 1987 that she chose acting over singing because [...] "I was too nervous to sing in front of people—it meant showing more of myself than acting. If you're on stage singing <b>and</b> <b>people</b> don't <b>like</b> it, <b>that's</b> too much rejection." [...] She later moved to New York, where her casual drug use became what she called [...] "a huge problem". She overcame the addiction before being cast in North and South.|$|R
5000|$|Aqualung wasn't {{a concept}} album, {{although}} {{a lot of}} people thought so. The idea came about from a photograph my wife at the time took of a tramp in London. I had feelings of guilt about the homeless, as well as fear <b>and</b> insecurity with <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> who seem a little scary. And I suppose all of that was combined with a slightly romanticized picture of the person who is homeless but yet a free spirit, who either won't or can't join in society's prescribed formats.So from that photograph and those sentiments, I began writing the words to [...] "Aqualung". I can remember sitting in a hotel room in L.A., working out the chord structure for the verses. It's quite a tortured tangle of chords, but it was meant to really drag you here and there and then set you down into the more gentle acoustic section of the song.|$|R
5000|$|One {{artist has}} stated that artist {{royalties}} per track from Aspiro/Tidal are currently over three times than those paid by Spotify, but that royalties may decrease to provide a sufficient return on investment. Jay-Z commented in an interview to Billboard that artists would be paid more by being streamed on Tidal than with Spotify, stating [...] "Will artists make more money? Even if it means less profit for our bottom line? Absolutely. That's easy for us. We can do that. Less profit for our bottom line, more money for the artist; fantastic. Let's do that today." [...] In the same interview he also stressed the service was for people [...] "lower down on the food chain". [...] "For someone like me, I can go on tour, {{but what about the}} people working on the record, the content creators and not just the artists? If they're not being compensated properly, then I think we'll lose some writers and producers <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> who depend on fair trade. Some would probably have to take another job, and I think we'll lose some great writers in the process." ...|$|E

50|$|The Doctor tells Selta that Orbis’s moon {{is unlike}} any other he’s seen. Most {{satellites}} rise and wane, but this one tracks Orbis as if connected by an invisible thread that extends to a point 50 miles out to sea. Selta says {{there will be a}} funeral-feast later to celebrate the lives of the children they lost during the storm. It will follow a relatively new Keltan tradition which was formulated by the Doctor himself generations ago after he pointed out that their previous method of eating and regurgitating their own deceased wasn’t a very efficient way to compost the seabed. Selta invites the Doctor to accompany her to the dance, but before he can even change the subject, they’re interrupted by the arrival of a huge clam-ship, signifying the return of the Molluscari. Selta rushes off the raise the alarm… As the Molluscari ship comes in to land, Crassostrea declares her intention to blast the Keltan habitation to dust. Saccostrea reminds her that the Galactic Council have not yet granted them the rights to this planet and they are only here to give the Keltans notice of their plans. They see the panicking jellyfish people massing nearby and Crassostrea prepares to address them. Yanos is shocked to see the Molluscari return as everyone knows their claim on this planet had been comprehensively rejected years ago by the Galactic Council, but the Doctor says the Molluscari are bullies <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> never like to be beaten. He offers to talk to the invaders and approaches the clam-ship, claiming to represent the Keltan species. Crassostrea emerges and mocks the Keltans, but the Doctor recognises her and remembers that she used to be male. He warns Crassostrea that he won’t tolerate any harassment of the Keltans, but the Molluscari leader reveals that she has in her possession a document from the Galactic Council confirming that the climate of Orbis is undergoing irreversible change and will shortly become inimical to the Keltan life. The Doctor acknowledges that the storm season shows no sign of ending, but that doesn’t mean the Keltans can’t adapt and thrive in their new environment. Unfortunately, it appears the Galactic Council don’t agree and in three day’s time the Keltan claim on Orbis will expire and be passed to the Molluscari. Yanos demands to see the document for himself, but as Crassostrea hands over the data pearl, she snaps shut her pincer and removes one of Yanos’s tentacles. Instead, she passes the pearl to the Doctor and advises him to study it well. In return, the Doctor switches on his sonic screwdriver, set to the exact pitch that will vibrate Molluscari from their shells. Crassostrea and Saccostrea retreat back to their ship in pain and seconds later the ship lifts off from the surface. Yanos is convinced the Keltans are doomed, but the Doctor urges him not to give up. Tonight they will dance and mourn their dead, but tomorrow they will start making stilts and building their town’s defences.|$|E
5000|$|About 1982 Marshall {{spent his}} last $55 for {{admission}} to Midwest Radical Therapy Conference, which was the [...] "best investment I ever made because I met <b>people</b> <b>and</b> made connections that I still have." [...] The importance of strokes of appreciation or affirmation, between communicants, had been emphasized for instance by adherents to transactional analysis. [...] "My workshops before this time used a language of conflict resolution and talked about getting power with <b>people</b> <b>and</b> stuff <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> They focused entirely on helping people deal with behaviors that were painful to them and finding ways of changing them. There was nothing about celebrating with people or affirming each other, or the words 'nurturance' or 'compassion'." [...] Marshall says the program led to the femininization of the program (beyond conflict).|$|R
50|$|Around the 14-15th century, Rajkunwar {{branch of}} Chauhan Dynasty {{claiming}} to be direct descendent of Hammir Dev Chauhan of Ranthambore along with other clans like Bandalgotis, Rajwars and Bachgotis ruled over {{a large part of}} the district. In the 19th century, one notable incident was the revolt of the native troops stationed at Sultanpur during the Sepoy Mutiny after the British annexation of Oudh. The troops rose in rebellion on 9 June 1857, and, after murdering two of their officers, sacked the station. Native <b>people</b> <b>and</b> tribes <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of Bhale Sultans also fought in the rebellion. Leaders like Lal Pratap Singh of Kalakankar and Maharaj Bariar Singh Rajkunwar along with others fought and died for the cause. Upon the restoration of order, Sultanpur cantonment was strengthened by a detachment of British troops; but in 1861 it was entirely abandoned as a military station.|$|R

Nevertheless, (s) he photographs these things somehow because of his/her duty. There are several circumstances that decide of the specificity of tourists' photographing.
