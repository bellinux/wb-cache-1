5|$|Historians {{have taken}} differing views of Æthelwulf's will. The editors of Alfred's will, Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge, suggest that Æthelwulf's other {{surviving}} son, Æthelberht, was {{excluded from the}} arrangement because he was provided for separately in the eastern kingdom (the recently conquered south-east England), where he acted as king in 855 and 856; it was probably intended that he should establish a separate dynasty there. The bequest to the three brothers would only have covered part of Æthelwulf's property. The transmission of folkland was governed by customary law, and another portion was reserved for the holder {{of the office of}} king. Keynes and Lapidge argue that Æthelwulf clearly intended that his personal property should be preserved intact, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been considered desirable that this should be held by the reigning king, so it is likely that he intended the kingship of western Wessex to be inherited by the survivor of the three brothers. This plan was abandoned when Æthelbald died in 860 and the kingdom was reunited under Æthelberht, and Æthelred's confirmation of the arrangement when he acceded in 865 recognised Alfred as heir apparent.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} what {{happened}} to Islam after this period <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have received a setback. Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat who invaded and briefly conquered Ladakh in 1532, 1545 and 1548, does not record any presence of Islam in Leh during his invasion although Shia Islam and Noorbakshia Islam continued to flourish in other regions of Ladakh.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of a}} seal by men {{of wealth}} and {{position}} was common before the Christian era, but high functionaries of the Church adopted the habit. An incidental allusion in one of St. Augustine's letters (217 to Victorinus) indicates that he used a seal. The practice spread, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{be taken for granted}} by King Clovis I {{at the very beginning of}} the Merovingian dynasty.|$|E

25|$|The Christianization of the Rus' {{people is}} {{supposed}} to have begun in the 860s and was the first stage in the process of Christianization of the East Slavs which continued well into the 11th century. Despite its historical and cultural significance, records detailing the event are frustratingly hard to come by, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been forgotten by the time of Vladimir's Baptism of Kiev in the 980s.|$|E
25|$|The clan rivalries {{which had}} erupted in {{rebellion}} were finding an outlet in local politics. The Mackenzie's position as Earl of Seaforth {{came to an}} end in 1716, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been arranged that while the Clan Ross held the county seat the Munros would represent the Tain Burghs. To secure the burghs, control of three out of the five was necessary. Ross ascendancy was secure in Tain, and from 1716 to 1745 the Munros controlled Dingwall.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{the highest}} {{cortisol}} secretion {{happens in the}} second half of the night with peak cortisol production occurring in the early morning. Following this, cortisol levels decline throughout the day with lowest levels during the ﬁrst half of the night. Cortisol awakening response is independent of this circadian variation in HPA axis activity; it is superimposed upon the daily rhythm of HPA axis activity; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be linked specifically to the event of awakening.|$|E

25|$|Two other {{supposed}} barrows {{were scheduled}} as Ancient Monuments but {{have now been}} shown by the same excavators not to be burial mounds. They are sited {{to the north of}} the oval barrow along the top of the hill. One is likely to have been the base of a windmill, probably in use for a relatively short time in the late 16th and early 17th century. The other is a natural mound, but many chipped flints were found there <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been a site where flints were obtained and partially worked (for finishing elsewhere) during the late neolithic period.|$|E
25|$|Harvest was in {{the late}} spring and during the dry summer months. Nomadic Amorites from the {{northwest}} would pasture their flocks of sheep and goats to graze on the stubble and be watered from the river and irrigation canals. For this privilege, {{they would have to}} pay a tax in wool, meat, milk, and cheese to the temples, who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood. In good years, all would go well, but in bad years, wild winter pastures would be in short supply, nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields, and conflicts with farmers would result. It would appear that the subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the Empire temporarily overcame this problem, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region.|$|E
25|$|During the 1660s, Shrew {{was adapted}} by John Lacy as Sauny the Scot, {{to make it}} better match with Fletcher's sequel. Originally {{performed}} under the Taming of the Shrew title, the play was published in 1698 as Sauny the Scot: or, The Taming of the Shrew: A Comedy. This version inconsistently anglicised the character names and recast the play in prose. Lacy also expanded the part of Grumio into the title role Sauny (who speaks in a heavy Scottish brogue), which he played himself. Sauny is an irreverent, cynical companion to Petruchio, and is comically terrified of his master's new bride. Lucentio was renamed Winlove, Baptista became Lord Beaufoy and Katherina was renamed Meg. In Sauny, Petruchio is much more vicious, threatening to whip Meg if she doesn't marry him, then telling everyone she is dead, and tying her to a bier. The play ends with her thoroughly tamed. Lacy's work premiered at Drury Lane in 1667, starring Susanna Verbruggen and George Powell. Samuel Pepys saw it on 9 April and again on 1 November, enjoying it on both occasions. The play was popular enough that it was still being performed as late as 1732, when it was staged at Goodman's Fields Theatre, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have supplanted Shrews place on the English stage {{for the rest of the}} seventeenth century and the first half of the eighteenth.|$|E

25|$|Giovanni died in 1429. According to Lorenzo, {{his fortune}} upon {{his death was}} worth around 180,000 gold florins. His death did not greatly affect the bank's operations, and the {{transition}} to Cosimo went smoothly, aided by Ilarione, who was retained as ministro. Fortunately for the bank, Lorenzo di Giovanni di Bicci de Medici was on excellent terms with Cosimo, and did not insist on dissolving the partnerships so he could receive {{his share of the}} patrimony (primogeniture not being operative here); many Florentine banks and mercantile businesses lasted only a generation or two because some of the inheriting sons usually wished to strike out on their own. At this time, the Medici bank was flourishing: besides the branches in Rome and Florence, the Venetian and Genevan branches had been founded. Ilarione would not last long in his position, and is mentioned as dead in a letter written in February 1433. The timing was unfortunate because the Albizzi government of Florence was moving against the young Medici-led resistance (galvanized by the Albizzi government's failure in a war against Lucca and Milan), culminating in Cosimo's exile to Venice. Despite the unfavorable politics in this period of the bank's history, its Italian branches turned in bumper profits, with as much as 62% of the total coming from Rome (in 1427, the Roman branch of the Medici bank had approximately 100,000 florins on deposit from the Papal Curia; in comparison, the total capitalization of the entire Medici bank was only about 25,000 gold florins) and 13% from Venice between 1420 and 1435 (with the later Medici branches opened in Bruges, London, Pisa, Avignon, Milan, and Lyon contributing nothing as they had not been founded yet). At this time, there seems to have been some sort of Medici office in Basel, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have lasted until 1443. De Roover speculates that it was a sub-branch of the Medici bank's Geneva branch serving the General Council of the Church, and was closed when the Council no longer made it worth their while to maintain it.|$|E
500|$|Despite his lowly origin, Constantine was {{reportedly}} brave and exceedingly beautiful, {{and managed to}} win the heart of Theodora Komnene (born 1097), the fourth daughter of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (...) and Irene Doukaina. Theodora had already been married once, to Constantine Kourtikes, but her husband had died without having had children. The marriage probably took place in , certainly {{after the death of}} Alexios I; Empress Irene apparently disapproved of it, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have soured her relations with Theodora, who is listed last and with the least favourable provisions in the typikon that Irene granted to the Kecharitomene Monastery.|$|E
500|$|A little {{matter that}} seems to have been {{overlooked}} by all of you is the opportunity to beautify the design of the nickel or five cent piece during your administration, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me {{that it would be a}} permanent souvenir of a most attractive sort. [...] As possibly you are aware, it is the only coin the design of which you can change during your administration, as I believe there is a law to the effect that the designs must not be changed oftener than every twenty-five years. [...] I should think also it might be the coin of which the greatest numbers are in circulation.|$|E

500|$|In response, Yeats {{delivered}} {{a series of}} speeches that attacked the [...] "quixotically impressive" [...] ambitions {{of the government and}} clergy, likening their campaign tactics to those of [...] "medieval Spain." [...] "Marriage is not to us a Sacrament, but, upon the other hand, the love of a man and woman, and the inseparable physical desire, are sacred. This conviction has come to us through ancient philosophy and modern literature, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> us a most sacrilegious thing to persuade two people who hate each other... to live together, and it is to us no remedy to permit them to part if neither can re-marry." [...] The resulting debate has been described as one of Yeats's [...] "supreme public moments", and began his ideological move away from pluralism towards religious confrontation.|$|E
500|$|Megadeth toured {{heavily in}} support of Youthanasia. They started the tour in November 1994, with live {{performances}} in South America. The tour continued in 1995, {{with a number of}} opening acts such as Korn, Flotsam and Jetsam and Fear Factory. During this period Megadeth also visited Europe, where they stayed for eight weeks. Ellefson shared his impressions from performing in front of European fans: [...] "So far, the audiences have been really good <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me that heavy metal and especially Megadeth are very much at the forefront of music in Europe. It seems like the attendance is better than it has ever been". The worldwide tour ended in September 1995, with the band performing at Monsters Of Rock in South America with Ozzy Osbourne and Alice Cooper as the headliners.|$|E
500|$|A fourth-season episode, [...] "Dunder Mifflin Infinity", {{said the}} company was founded in 1949 by Robert Dunder and Robert Mifflin, {{originally}} to sell brackets for use in construction. The fifth-season episode [...] "Company Picnic" [...] said that the co-founders met {{on a tour of}} Dartmouth College. U.S. News and World Report likens it to many real companies in its size range: [...] "It is facing an increasingly competitive marketplace. Like many smaller players, it just can't compete with the low prices charged by big-box rivals like Staples, OfficeMax and Office Depot, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be constantly bleeding corporate customers that are focused on cutting costs themselves." [...] The show's creators share this assessment—"It's basically a Staples, just not as big", says co-producer Kent Zbornak—as do some of those companies. [...] "Since Dunder Mifflin could be considered among our competitors", says Chuck Rubin, an Office Depot executive, [...] "I think Michael Scott is actually the perfect person to run their Scranton office." ...|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{following}} {{the end of}} the series. Cast member Wil Wheaton reviewed it in April 2008 for AOL TV. He couldn't remember actually appearing in the episode, {{and it was the first}} time since it was originally broadcast that he had seen it. He said that it wasn't good, but that it was [...] "not as overtly racist as I recalled. I mean, it's certainly not as racist as [...] "Angel One" [...] is sexist, and if the Ligonians hadn't been arbitrarily determined to be entirely African American, it wouldn't have even been an issue." [...] He said that the episode is an example of the type of episodes in the first season that would have resulted in the show being cancelled mid-season if it hadn't been so well supported by the fans and run directly into syndication. James Hunt, whilst writing for Den of Geek, differed from Wheaton's assessment and asserted that the episode was racist. He said that [...] "this isn't just bad television, it's openly offensive, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> do its best effort to undo some of the most important lessons the original series imparted some 25 years after we're supposed to have learned them." [...] Overall, he said that this was [...] "quite possibly the worst piece of Star Trek ever made".|$|E
