5|$|The {{financial}} drain of the Imjin War in Korea {{against the}} Japanese {{was one of}} the many problems – fiscal or other – facing Ming China during the reign of the Wanli Emperor (1572–1620). In the beginning of his reign, Wanli surrounded himself with able advisors and made a conscientious effort to handle state affairs. His Grand Secretary Zhang Juzheng (1572–82) built up an effective network of alliances with senior officials. However, there was no one after him skilled enough to maintain the stability of these alliances; officials soon banded together in opposing political factions. Over time Wanli grew tired of court affairs and frequent political quarreling amongst his ministers, preferring to stay behind the walls of the Forbidden City <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> officials' sight. Scholar-officials lost prominence in administration as eunuchs became intermediaries between the aloof emperor and his officials; any senior official who wanted to discuss state matters had to persuade powerful eunuchs with a bribe simply to have his demands or message relayed to the emperor.|$|E

Further estates could be created out of these estates in a process called subinfeudation.|$|E

25|$|In One Day Internationals, Rameez Raja (for Pakistan against England at Karachi in 1987) {{was given}} out for {{hitting the ball}} away with his bat to avoid being run out going for his century off the last ball of the innings, and Mohinder Amarnath (for India against Sri Lanka at Ahmedabad in 1989) was given out for kicking the ball away to avoid being run out. Another batsman to be given out this way is Inzamam-ul-Haq of Pakistan in the first ODI of India vs Pakistan Hutch Cup on 6 February 2006. After Inzamam drove the ball to mid off, Indian Suresh Raina threw {{it back to the}} striker's end, Inzamam {{stopping}} it with his bat. Umpire Simon Taufel gave him out as he was in the line of the stumps <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> crease (and thus would have been run out had the ball hit the stumps).|$|E

25|$|Moyne {{arrived in}} his car with his driver, Lance Corporal Arthur Fuller, his secretary, Dorothy Osmond, and his ADC, Major Andrew Hughes-Onslow. The ADC went to {{open the front door}} of the {{residence}} and the driver got out to open the door for Moyne. They were suddenly told not to move, as Bet-Zuri emerged and shot Fuller in the chest, causing him to collapse in the driveway and bleed to death in minutes. Hakim then pulled the car door open and shot Moyne three times. The first bullet hit him in the neck on the right side, just above the clavicle, the second penetrated his abdomen, punctured his colon and large intestine, and became embedded to the right of the second lumbar vertebrae, while the third shot, fired after Moyne raised his right hand, ripped across four of his fingers and went in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chest, causing no serious injuries.|$|E
25|$|It is Tobias’s friend Harry (and his wife, Edna) {{who bring}} the play to its conclusion, forcing Tobias {{to define what}} {{friendship}} is all about. In the end, Tobias proclaims that friendship is not about wants but rather about rights. Tobias’s friend Harry {{has the right to}} move into Tobias’s house even if that is not what Tobias, or the rest of his family, wants. Contradicting this conclusion is the story concerning his cat that Tobias tells {{in the middle of the}} play. In this case, the cat wanted to be left alone. Tobias was uncomfortable with the cat’s noncompliance, and eventually he hits the cat and then has the cat euthanised. But disregarding the cat, Tobias seems true to his definition of friendship. He has, after all, allowed his sister-in-law to live off him. He allows his thirty-something daughter to continually move in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house, and he tolerates his wife. He also tolerates his friend Harry’s moving into his house uninvited. At the end of the play, Tobias questions Harry’s efforts at friendship and honesty. Then he apologizes. Albee admits that the character of Tobias is based on his adopted father.|$|E

500|$|Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot {{called the}} song exhilarating in nature, with a furious, layered, {{percussion}} beat, praising the song's narrative {{about a man}} who [...] "lost in translation with a whole … nation". MT Richards of Slant Magazine stated that [...] "Power" [...] sounded nothing like any hip-hop song of recent memory, going as far as saying that the single signified that West was on a [...] "league of his own." [...] Richards largely praised, the song, musing that the [...] "misanthropic 'Power' will surely alienate those longing for another sunny hit like [...] "Hey Mama". At last, West has emerged steely-eyed, bold, <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mind." [...] AbsolutePunk's Drew Beringer stated that the track was a classic West song, with the track featuring a [...] "brilliant sample of King Crimson" [...] and infectious hand claps.|$|E
500|$|Three of {{the four}} bullets that struck Lennon's back passed {{completely}} through his body <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chest, one of which hit and became lodged in his upper left arm, while the fourth lodged itself in his aorta beside his heart; {{nearly all of them}} would have been fatal by themselves as each bullet hit vital arteries around the heart. As Lennon had been shot four times at close range with hollow-point bullets, Lennon's affected organs (particularly his left lung) and major blood vessels above his heart were virtually destroyed upon impact. Lynn later stated to reporters on the extent of Lennon's injuries: [...] "If he [...] had been shot this way {{in the middle of the}} operating room with a whole team of surgeons ready to work on him... he still wouldn't have survived his injuries".|$|E

500|$|With filming {{beginning}} on May 21, 2007, [...] "It's Alive!" [...] marked the permanent relocation of production from Miami to Los Angeles. Five episodes {{of the first}} season were shot on location in Miami, which Cerone said was [...] "a bigger hassle than it was worth". Showtime programming chief Robert Greenblatt said that [...] "It just became impossible, production-wise, to shoot the whole show [...] ", because of the overlap between Dexters production window and Florida's hurricane season, making property insurance costly. A small crew flew to Miami with Hall and filmed, according to producer Sara Colleton, [...] "a lot of pieces—not just Dexter walking in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> door or car, but also scenes that we know we'll need and can use", which the writers then worked into the episode and others. For the episode, Biscayne Bay was substituted with a set in Los Angeles, while most on location scenes were filmed in and around San Pedro and Long Beach, California.|$|E
500|$|To {{give the}} {{illusion}} of being freaks, the appearance of several actors was modified by make-up elements. John Fleck (Gecko) spent over ten hours in makeup each day to transform into <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> character. The skin, which needed to look like alligator hide, consisted of seven or eight separate pieces {{and needed to be}} glued to Fleck's face. Patrick Bauchau (Lodz) had several contact lenses pairs of different opaqueness. While one pair enabled him to see shapes, another pair made him basically blind and he had to be led around the set. Debra Christofferson (Lila) had a fake beard applied to her chin; the beard was custom-made by hand-tying human hair onto lace that would disappear when the beard was glued onto the skin. The beard of the early episodes was so heavy that the chemicals caused Christofferson's skin to be raw {{at the end of the}} shooting day, and was later split into three pieces. Christofferson still needed to be careful with mouth movements. According to the actress, [...] "the beard actually determined Lila's voice." ...|$|E
500|$|His wealth {{continued}} to grow significantly (in line with U.S. economic growth) after as the demand for gasoline soared, eventually reaching about $900 million {{on the eve of}} the First World War, including significant interests in banking, shipping, mining, railroads, and other industries. According to the New York Times obituary, [...] "it was estimated after Mr. Rockefeller retired from business that he had accumulated close to $1,500,000,000 out of the earnings of the Standard Oil trust <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> other investments. This was probably the greatest amount of wealth that any private citizen had ever been able to accumulate by his own efforts." [...] By the time of his death in 1937, Rockefeller's remaining fortune, largely tied up in permanent family trusts, was estimated at $1.4 billion, while the total national GDP was $92 billion. According to some methods of wealth calculation, Rockefeller's net worth over the last decades of his life would easily place him as the wealthiest known person in recent history. As a percentage of the United States' GDP, no other American fortune — including those of Bill Gates or Sam Walton — would even come close.|$|E

500|$|The {{title track}} {{incorporates}} a sped-up sample of Gloria Gaynor's [...] "Casanova Brown", {{with an emphasis}} on the line [...] "I was lonely and naïve" [...] from the sample. [...] "Running" [...] has Scott-Heron's spoken word vocals scattered and repeated. [...] "Ur Soul and Mine" [...] samples the vocals from Rui da Silva's house classic [...] "Touch Me", distorting the vocals in the song's verse, but retaining its refrain. The densely produced [...] "Home" [...] features clattering snares, a heavily reverbed keyboard sample, a drum loop, and a vocal sample of Scott-Heron singing the line [...] "home is where the hatred is...", taken from the song of the same name from his 1971 album Pieces of a Man. BBC Online's Ele Beattie said that Jamie xx's sampling [...] "tunes the listener in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> musical predecessors. He rewires a personal musical canon into something utterly contemporary". Robert Christgau characterizes Scott-Heron's original narratives as those of [...] "a drug fiend of considerable perversity and tremendous intelligence who's gonna be dead soon", and comments that Jamie xx [...] "hears in [...] last testament an irreversible disintegration that he translates into heavily sampled minimalist electro marked indelibly by Scott-Heron's weariness, arrogance, and wit." ...|$|E
500|$|Grim Fandango is an {{adventure}} game, {{in which the}} player controls Manuel [...] "Manny" [...] Calavera (calavera being Spanish for 'skull') as he follows Mercedes [...] "Meche" [...] Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the GrimE engine, pre-rendering static backgrounds from 3D models, while the main objects and characters are animated in 3D. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a keyboard, a joystick, or a gamepad. Manny must collect objects {{that can be used}} with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. The game lacks any type of HUD. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games, the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them, but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head towards that object or person as he walks by. The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat jacket. Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in most LucasArts adventure games, the player can never die or otherwise get into a no-win situation (that prevents completion of the game).|$|E
