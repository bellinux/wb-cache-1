500|$|The train departs {{the station}} {{to the right and}} climbs a small lift leading to a short drop, then circles around to the [...] lift hill, {{carrying}} the riders into the [...] mountain. It is the tallest attraction at Walt Disney World, beating The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror by 6 inches. Disney keeps it just under 200 feet because law requires structures 200 feet or taller to have a blinking red light as a beacon for low-flying planes, which Disney feels would take parkgoers out of the experience. On the way up it passes through a ransacked temple with murals of the yeti, warning the riders that the mountain is his territory. At {{the top of the mountain}} the train curves around the main peak and goes through a cave. When it emerges, it draws to a halt in front of track that has been torn apart, presumably by the yeti. The train itself is held in place by a series of rubber tires while an <b>automatic</b> <b>switch</b> rotates the piece of track directly behind the train. The train then rolls backwards along a new route that spirals down through the mountain, coming to a halt in a large cave, where riders see the yeti's shadow on the wall as he tears up more track. This effect distracts riders from noticing another automatic track switch rotates in front of them. As the shadow moves away, the train rolls forward out of the mountain and down the main [...] drop. It enters a 250° turn and speeds back up through another cave in the mountain, where the roars of the yeti are heard once more. The train exits from the rear of the mountain and enters a large helix before being lifted back into the mountain a final time. The train drops through a cave, where the yeti is reaching down toward it. On reaching the bottom of this drop, riders return to the unloading dock and depart into a gift shop. One ride takes about 2 minutes and 50 seconds.|$|E

A center-tapped transformer is often used in the output stage of an audio power amplifier in a push-pull circuit. Modulation transformers in AM transmitters are very similar.|$|E

50|$|The Eryx missile uses a SACLOS {{guidance}} system, the launcher tracks a {{light source}} {{on the rear}} of the missile and compares its position with the center of the launcher's cross-hair, sending corrective signals down a trailing control wire. The missile increases resistance to jamming by having a beacon as the light source on {{the rear of the}} missile that pulsates or blinks at a special encoded rate recognized by the Eryx's tracking device located on the launch post. Unlike most wire guides antitank missiles that use SACLOS guidance, which require a complex optical tracker unit that has to zoom from a wide to narrow view in micro seconds after the missile is launched (e.g. the MILAN), the Eryx uses one charge-coupled device (CCD) matrix that operate in the IR spectrum, and two fields of view (one narrow and one large) with an <b>automatic</b> <b>switch</b> during missile flight. Again Aérospatiale also states that this unique and simplified SACLOS tracking system provides for a far more cost effective solution and enable the Eryx to be highly resistant to decoys or jamming and other enemy counter measures.|$|E

Power utility companies are using <b>automatic</b> <b>switch</b> called IntelliRupter® for automatic fault detection, isolation and service restoration.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{measurement results}} of electricity use and lighting conditions in individual office rooms located in Lund, Sweden. The {{aim is to}} demonstrate the energy saving potential by using different lighting systems and the satisfaction of users. The measurements are carried out in one empty reference room and four fully occupied test rooms equipped with different electric light control systems. The tested systems include: a presence detector (<b>automatic</b> <b>switch</b> on/off), a manual switch at the door combined with absence detector (<b>automatic</b> <b>switch</b> off), a photoelectric dimming combined with presence detector, and a switchable task light with no ambient lighting except daylight. The four rooms are fully occupied by test persons performing their normal computer-based tasks, and who make a subjective evaluation of lighting conditions {{in the room and}} control system once a week. The results for the first monitoring period show that the <b>automatic</b> <b>switch</b> on/off (presence) system is the one yielding the highest electricity use, which repeats earlier simulation results. The photoelectric dimming system which combines a presence detector yields very modest energy savings compared to the presence detector system, a result which contradicts earlier findings but which may be explained by malfunctions and poor sensor position. The room with the task lamp achieves the lowest energy use, which is mostly attributed to the low levels of illumination in the room, which is further confirmed by the test persons. The system with manual switch at the door combined with absence detector achieves the best results in terms of combined low energy use and user satisfaction, and the magnitude of the savings are generally greater than anticipated in earlier simulation studies achieved in the same context...|$|E

[...] Four of NEC's factories were destroyed, killing 105 of NEC's engineers and workers. Thirteen of Tokyo's telephone offices were destroyed by fire.

In response, the Ministry of Communications accelerated major programs to install <b>automatic</b> telephone <b>switching</b> systems and enter radio broadcasting. [...] The first <b>automatic</b> <b>switching</b> systems were the Strowger-type model made by Automatic Telephone Manufacturing Co. (ATM) in the United Kingdom.
