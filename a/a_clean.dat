For the Carina {{plant in}} Brisbane, {{a change in}} {{management}} in 1996 {{has led to a}} combined effort by management and staff to improve operational efficiency. This has included the adoption of Quality Assurance and HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point). As an extension of this process, the company has also recognised the potential benefits of <b>a</b> <b>Cleaner</b> Production approach. The company has initiated <b>a</b> <b>Cleaner</b> Production project to investigate ways in which volumes of wastewater and the load of pollutants contained in the wastewater can be reduced. The stated goal is to achieve zero emissions for wastewater from the site. By adopting <b>a</b> <b>Cleaner</b> Production approach, County Bake will attempt to reduce waste as far as possible before investigating treatment options. This paper describes the process used to implement <b>a</b> <b>Cleaner</b> Production program at the Country Bake site. It also describes some of the preliminary work that has been undertaken in quantifying the volumes and quality of wastewater generated at the site, identifying the sources of these wastes, and investigating options for waste avoidance, waste reduction at source, reuse and recycling. Country Bake has been supported in this process by the UNEP Centre for Cleaner Production in the Food Industry...|$|R

Buffon was finally beaten by Maximiliano Moralez in a 4–1 win over Atalanta, after going 745 minutes without conceding a goal in Serie A, and equalling Luca Marchegiani's sixth-best unbeaten streak in Serie A history.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{presence}} of any extended foreground correlated regions in <b>a</b> <b>cleaned</b> CMB map. To estimate the cosmological parameters of interest, it is cus-tomary to employ a galactic mask on <b>a</b> <b>cleaned</b> map to omit the galactic region which remain contaminated even after cleaning. This study shows that there are residual foreground correlations present even outside a galactic mask, which could potentially be responsible {{for some of the}} large scale anomalies found in CMB. Here, we defined two correlation statistics, one in pixel space and the other in multipole space. Pixel correlation statistic was used to convey a pictorial impression of the level of resid-ual foregrounds present in <b>a</b> <b>cleaned</b> map, while the multipole correlation statistic was used to identify any polluted multipoles. Using the pixel statistic, we find that there are notable spatially-extended, foreground-correlated features in the estimated CMB map. One interesting feature we found is that, the anomalous CMB cold spot region in the southern galactic hemisphere is highly correlated with synchrotron emis-sion templates. Using the multipole statistic, we find that the CMB quadrupole is contaminated by synchrotron. Key words:...|$|R
