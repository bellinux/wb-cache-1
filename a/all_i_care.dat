500|$|Volk {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan in 1963. His decision to attend Michigan rather than Ohio State was influenced by family ties, including Bob Chappuis, who was Volk's uncle and {{finished second in the}} Heisman Trophy voting while playing for the undefeated 1947 Wolverines. Volk noted:"I had all these stories growing up. He [...] was my hero, so I always wanted to go to Michigan. ... And I didn't like Woody [...] anyway. It was just my Grandpa telling me because he didn't like Woody, and he hoped Woody would choke on his Thanksgiving turkey. ... Because of Uncle Bob going to Michigan, that's where I wanted to go. You know, I loved the helmets, loved the uniforms. I said 'Hey, if I could just sit on the bench, that's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> about.'" ...|$|E
500|$|A {{major concern}} with the second act was the {{effectiveness}} of the characters He and She (later called by Rodgers [...] "Mr. and Mrs. God"), before whom Billy appeared after his death. Mr. and Mrs. God were depicted as a New England minister and his wife, seen in their parlor. The couple was still part of the show at the Boston opening. Rodgers said to Hammerstein, [...] "We've got to get God out of that parlor". When Hammerstein inquired where he should put the deity, Rodgers replied, [...] "I don't care where you put Him. Put Him on a ladder for <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>care,</b> only get Him out of that parlor!" [...] Hammerstein duly put Mr. God (renamed the Starkeeper) atop a ladder, and Mrs. God was removed from the show. Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest terms this change a mistake, leading to a more fantastic afterlife, which was later criticized by The New Republic as [...] "a Rotarian atmosphere congenial to audiences who seek not reality but escape from reality, not truth but escape from truth".|$|E
500|$|The album's cover art, {{photographed by}} Brad Klausen, depicts an avocado {{cut in half}} with the seed still in place. McCready said, [...] "That symbolizes just kind of... Ed's {{at the end of}} the process and said, for <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> right now, we've done such a good job on this record, and we're kind of tired from it. Let's throw an avocado on the cover. I think that's what happened, and our art {{director}} goes, hey, that's not a bad idea. I think we were watching the Super Bowl, and we had some guacamole or something." [...] Because the album is self-titled, many fans refer to it as [...] "Avocado" [...] or [...] "The Avocado Album." [...] The cover was named in Pitchfork Media's top 25 worst album covers of 2006. The liner notes art features footage from the [...] "Life Wasted" [...] music video, directed by artist Fernando Apodaca. The photographs involve the band members with their skin decaying and animals crawling in and out of it, as Apodaca felt the songs, [...] "Life Wasted" [...] in particular, fit [...] "my interpretation of the how fragile life is". The album was also issued on a double vinyl.|$|E

500|$|The album's lead single was [...] "Moto Psycho", and a {{video was}} also made for this song. The song is about people who commute every day to work, {{spending}} a lot of time on the road. [...] "Dread and the Fugitive Mind" [...] was released on the [...] compilation a year earlier, at the insistence of Megadeth's former label, Capitol Records. The album's opener, [...] "Disconnect", is explained by Mustaine as being about living a double life and [...] "the person I want you to think that I am and the person inside that I really know I am." [...] "Coming Home" [...] was only available on the Japanese pressing as a bonus track, but has since been released on the Warchest box set. Mustaine has stated that concept for [...] "Promises" [...] is [...] "prejudiced relationships," [...] such as those between a Catholic and a Protestant in Ireland, interracial and same-sex relationships, [...] "it could be about a guy and a sheep for <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>care.</b> It just means that if we can't be together in this life, maybe we'll make it in the next." ...|$|E
500|$|David Browne of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album a B+. Browne said, [...] "Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed {{instruments}} both acoustic and electric." [...] He praised several songs as being [...] "as powerful as anything the band has done." [...] Browne criticized the album's production, saying [...] "like many self-produced efforts, it shows." [...] He added, [...] "With arrangements that crest and {{fall to the}} point where a road map would have helped, the overlong (16-song) album is often unwieldy and could have benefited from judicious trimming." [...] Allmusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that [...] "it might seem like nothing more than heavy metal, but a closer listen reveals that Soundgarden haven't tempered their ambitions at all." [...] The reviewer for Melody Maker said that [...] "their roots don't matter now. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> for now is the immediacy of their pop moments." [...] Critic Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention of one star, describing it as [...] "brutal depression simplified" [...] and highlighted by the songs [...] "Ty Cobb" [...] and [...] "Applebite", while Jason Josephes from Pitchfork Media called it a [...] "double shot of grunge, no foam but plenty of caffeine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the films}} {{were being made}} as the novels were being published, the filmmakers {{had no idea of}} the story's outcome until the release of the final novel in 2007. Kloves spoke of his {{relationship}} with Rowling when adapting the novels by saying, [...] "The thing is about Jo, which is remarkable for someone who had no experience with the filmmaking process, was her intuition. We had a conversation the very first day I met her where she said, 'I know the movies can't be the books... because I know what's coming and it's impossible to fully dramatise on screen what I'm going to write. But I just ask you to be true to the characters; that's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> about.'" [...] Kloves also said, [...] "I don't know what compelled me to say this , but I said, 'I've just got to warn you my favourite character is not Harry. My favourite character is Hermione.' And I think for some weird reason, from that moment on, she sort of trusted me." ...|$|E
60|$|I sprang into my cab, {{ordering}} {{the man to}} drive fast for the railroad station. It mattered not to me whether Walkirk went to Europe or not. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> for was to catch the next train which would take me to Arden.|$|R
60|$|The barber-gillie, who was {{a doctor}} too, {{was called in to}} {{prescribe}} for me; but as he spoke in the Gaelic, I understood not a word of his opinion, and was too sick even to ask for a translation. I knew well enough I was ill, and that was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> about.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; but I didn't ask you {{a single}} {{question}} with regard to your past: I didn't wish to know about it. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> for was that, wherever you came from, whatever you had done, whoever you had loved, you were mine at last. Harry, if originally you had known I had loved, would you never have cared for me?' ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{primarily}} recorded at recording studios MSR Studios NYC, Cake Studio, British Grove Studios and the Sotogrande Studios in New York, London and Spain, respectively {{over the course}} of three weeks, although sessions took place throughout 2009 and 2011, although Duffy had been recording songs she had written using her computer and iPod since the release of Rockferry, some of which remained in demo form until the final stages of the recording process. Duffy had formed a songwriting partnership with Albert Hammond for the record, which resulted in nine of the ten final songs released being written, composed and produced by Duffy and Hammond together. Aside from her partnership with Hammond, Duffy also forged collaborative efforts with other musicians who she felt reflected the sound change she was aiming for, including hip hop group The Roots. Duffy {{said in an interview that}} their involvement would be limited to [...] "a rhythm section" [...] going on to say [...] "if you know The Roots you will know just how cool [...] is. I love them and they are so cool." [...] She was also heavily involved with the recording process. The Daily Telegraph reports that often Duffy was a perfectionist regarding her songs, and that she often stayed in the studio with her mix engineer to ensure the composition sounded exactly as she wanted. This was often done without the help of Hammond, and she was quoted [...] "this is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> about. I keep a tight rein when it comes to quality control." [...] Billboard reported in November later that year that Duffy had experimented with a new dance sound, confirming that neither Bernard Butler nor Steve Booker, who produced the bulk of Duffy's debut album, Rockferry, had returned for the record.|$|E

5000|$|In a 2016 {{interview}} discussing album covers, O'Neill said [...] "I {{always wore}} what I felt comfortable in... <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> about was that I {{got to keep}} the leather jacket. The only time I had a stylist was for Danced in the Fire. I had boofy hair and a fan and {{to be perfectly honest}} it looked nothing like me but it was done already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Reckon some one's {{got to be}} your boss," [...] drawled Carmichael. [...] "Shore I ain't hankerin' for the job.

An' if she says you're not to take them rides--you won't. Savvy that, miss?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} not," [...] I said, with a laugh. The manner of my {{reception}} {{by the great}} feminist could not be considered now. That he would be annoyed to see me, and probably treat me to some solemn insolence, I had no doubt, but I supposed {{that he would not}} absolutely dare to throw me out. And that was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> for. [...] "Won't you take my arm?" [...] I asked.|$|R

6000|$|At last I said, [...] "Do you know, Polly, I {{could not}} think {{what you had to}} tell me. I saw you had {{something}} on your mind, that you were anxious and absent, and that your visit had some purpose more than you pretended,--and yet, as you assured me that <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> for were well, I could not conceive what it could be. Did you see it in the paper before Charley started to business?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Simply this good, {{that you}} would not be bound in a manner that makes you unhappy. If you did not intend that when you asked me to be your wife--Oh, Harry, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> want is to make you happy. That is <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>care</b> for, <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> think about?" ...|$|R
500|$|Clem Burke of Blondie {{has said}} [...] "Early on <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> about was Keith Moon and the Who. When I was about eleven or twelve, my {{favourite}} part of drum lessons {{was the last}} ten minutes, when I'd get {{to sit at the}} drumset and play along to my favourite record. I'd bring in 'My Generation'. At the end of the song, the drums go nuts. 'My Generation' was a turning point for me because before that it was all the Charlie Watts and Ringo type of thing." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not a bit. So {{long as we}} put a full team {{into the}} field, that's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> about. I've often {{wondered}} what it's like to go in first and bowl unchanged the whole time." ...|$|E
60|$|I felt {{it would}} be wise to look before I leaped. The Bay lay under me, a mile wide where it opened into the great slumbering smoky canyon. All below was chaos of {{splintered}} stone and slope, green jumble of cedar, ruined, detached, sliding, standing cliff walls, leaning yellow crags--an awful hole. But I could get down, and that was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> for. <b>I</b> ran along to the left, jumping cracks, bounding over the uneven stones with sure, swift feet, and came to where the cliff ended in weathered slope and scaly bench.|$|R

[...] "But I guess you better {{go back to your}} office, and go to work as if nothing had happened--till something does happen. I shall close the paper out as soon as I can. I was thinking of doing that just before you came in. I was thinking of taking you into the law business with me. Marcia and I were talking about it here.

60|$|I was nettled by her brusque {{manner of}} asserting her folly, and I {{told her that}} neither did I {{as far as that}} went, in a tone which almost {{suggested}} that she was welcome to break her neck for <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>cared.</b> This was considerably more than I meant, but I don't like rude girls. I had been introduced to her only the day before--at the round tea-table--and she had barely acknowledged the introduction. I had not caught her name but I had noticed her fine, arched eyebrows which, so the physiognomists say, are a sign of courage.|$|R
5000|$|At Belmont on October 4, Bird Town was matched against older fillies and mares for {{the first}} time in the Grade I Beldame Stakes over nine furlongs. Ridden by Aaron Gryder, she took the lead soon after the start and set the pace before being {{overtaken}} on the final turn by the favored Sightseek and finished second, four and a half lengths behind the older filly. Despite her defeat, Zito praised his filly saying [...] "I can't be more thrilled... <b>I</b> don't <b>care</b> what anybody tells me, Bird Town is the best three-year-old filly right now.
