5|$|Detachment Brandenstein {{attacked}} {{towns of}} Kotka and Lahti. The Red Guards' strong defence {{in the former}} stalled the Germans' plan, but they took over Lahti on 19–20 April.

The battle was mild, but strategically important as it cut connection between the western and eastern Red Guards. Fierce battles, in the town <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> <b>area</b> broke out between 22 April and 2 May 1918, as several thousand western Red Guard and Red civilian refugees tried to push through Lahti {{on their way to}} Russia.

5|$|Despite {{being set}} in Yorkshire, the {{majority}} of location filming was moved to Buckinghamshire, although Levisham railway station <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> <b>area</b> in North Yorkshire were used.
