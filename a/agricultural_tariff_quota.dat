The large differences in average tariffs across countries make it possible for farmers in one country to benefit from tariff protection while farmers in other countries lose income because of lower prices resulting from those tariffs.

40|$|Several {{proposals}} for liberalising <b>agricultural</b> <b>tariff</b> rate <b>quotas</b> (TRQs) {{have been proposed}} within the WTO Doha Development Round. The literature suggests that the effectiveness of liberalisation depends upon which of the three elements of a TRQ constrains imports. Most contributions assume perfect competition. This article uses an oligopoly two-stage capacity constrained model, in which the mode of competition is endogenous, to investigate the impact of different liberalisation options of TRQs, that is, {{the reduction in the}} in-quota and out-of-quota tariffs and the expansion of the quota.

The first Q imports entering within the quota portion of a TRQ are usually subject to a lower, tariff rate called the Inside <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> rate or ITQR.

Taiwan may want to consider adopting a similar approach when negotiating TPP membership, forming a strong negotiating team, and insisting that sensitive agricultural products be excluded from having import duty reduced to zero (in the same way as exemptions have been arranged for Japanese beef, pork, dairy products, rice, etc.); by designing a range of appropriate tariff reduction and <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> models, Taiwan could ensure that if, during the process of market opening, it was discovered that the tariff reductions were leading to a dramatic increase in imports that was causing harm to Taiwan’s <b>agricultural</b> production, then <b>tariffs</b> could be raised to mitigate the harm (this is what is generally known as “special safeguards”).|$|R

Welfare comparisons boil down to sourcing costs comparisons. Quotas tend to dominate at high domestic prices, ad valorem tariffs at intermediate prices and specific tariffs at low domestic prices. Welfare maxima are achieved with more restrictive policies than under perfect competition. These results rationalize separate negotiations for sensitive products in the Doha Round and the setting of tariff-rate quotas that mimic import quotas for these products. Finally, in ascertaining the robustness of our policy ranking to the choice of variable anchoring the comparisons, we found that specific tariffs unambiguously dominate ad valorem <b>tariffs</b> and <b>quotas</b> when government revenue or imports anchor the comparisons. However, some quota revenues and import levels cannot be achieved with <b>tariffs.</b> <b>agricultural</b> trade, domestic monopoly, price-equivalence, <b>quotas,</b> <b>tariffs,</b> trade policy,...|$|R

The {{international}} dairy sector {{is one of}} the most heavily protected commodity sectors in agriculture.

We characterize an index of trade policy restrictiveness defined as the uniform tariff equivalent which maintains the same volume of trade as a given set of <b>tariffs,</b> <b>quotas,</b> and domestic taxes and subsidies.

40|$|The use of tariff-rate quotas as a {{protectionist}} device has not {{yet been}} quite well understood. There is a widespread understanding that the offer of an additional <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> will generate a growth in the volume exported equivalent to the extra amount yielded. However, this may not happen, due to the characteristics of the tariff-quota system. Given the demand curve for a certain product, only one of the three components of the tariff-quota mechanism is determinant in restraining imports: the volume of the quota, the in-quota or the extra-quota. In addition, the estimate of gains in the value exported must include the increase in the ?quota-rent? allowed by the additional quota. This paper aims to point out the importance of an accurate assessment of the effects of additional <b>tariff</b> <b>quotas</b> for some Brazilian agricultural exports.

40|$|After {{joining the}} WTO in 2002, Taiwan allowed rice imports {{for the first}} time by {{implementing}} an import quota subject to a special safeguard tariff. In 2003, the import quota was expanded to a two-tier <b>tariff</b> rate import <b>quota</b> system. Although Taiwan maintained land set-asides and domestic support prices for producer sales to the State Trading Enterprise, the latter was limited to importing only 65 percent of the import quota with the rest sold to private traders. This sudden transformation of the Taiwanese import regime and rice market along with the government proposal for a "strategic alliance" amongst traders highlights the importance of studying the effects of policy reforms in the framework of imperfect domestic market structure. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze Taiwanese rice policy reforms using a computational partial equilibrium model. The impact of import controls, price supports, land set-aside and alternative market structures are assessed, including the potential change in regimes within the <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> system. Our results show that the "strategic alliance" proposed by the agricultural authority will further distort the domestic market. Elimination of the domestic support price and land set-aside improves social welfare independent of the market structure while a change in the market structure towards competition is always social welfare improving regardless of domestic policy instruments.
