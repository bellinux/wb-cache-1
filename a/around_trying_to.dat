After hearing from Wright that he would not call the police because he feared for his life, Curtis Jones placed a call to the Leflore County sheriff, and another to his mother in Chicago. Distraught, she called Emmett's mother Mamie Till Bradley. Wright and his wife Elizabeth drove to Sumner, where Elizabeth's brother contacted the sheriff.|$|E

25|$|This pattern goes on {{for some}} time, until the Super Bowl comes up and Tender's agent plans him an {{elaborate}} wedding to take place at half-time, following which, Tender will issue another miraculous prediction. Tender goes wandering <b>around,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> meet up with Fertility, which he finally does in a men's bathroom where they've taken adjacent stalls. Adam appears then with a gun, and reveals that he's already laid a trap to kill Tender's agent {{the same way he}} killed the caseworker, so that Tender would be suspect for both murders. Fertility confirms that the agent will die the next day at the Super Bowl, and comes up with a plan for Tender to make a prediction big enough to distract the police long enough for him to escape. Adam, intending this all along, plans to escape with Tender and Fertility. Agreed on their course of action, the three part.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{attempts}} {{often have}} revolved <b>around</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> discover what traumatic event {{had caused the}} amnesia, and drugs such as intravenously administered barbiturates (often thought of as 'truth serum') were popular as treatment for psychogenic amnesia during World War II; benzodiazepines may have been substituted later. 'Truth serum' drugs were thought to work by making a painful memory more tolerable when expressed through relieving the strength of an emotion attached to a memory. Under the influence of these 'truth' drugs the patient would more readily talk about what had occurred to them. However, information elicited from patients {{under the influence of}} drugs such as barbiturates would be a mixture of truth and fantasy, and was thus not regarded as scientific in gathering accurate evidence for past events. Often treatment was aimed at treating the patient as a whole, and probably varied in practice in different places. Hypnosis was also popular as a means for gaining information from people about their past experiences, but like 'truth' drugs really only served to lower the threshold of suggestibility so that the patient would speak easily but not necessarily truthfully. If no motive for the amnesia was immediately apparent, deeper motives were usually sought by questioning the patient more intensely, often in conjunction with hypnosis and 'truth' drugs. In many cases, however, patients were found to spontaneously recover from their amnesia on their own accord so no treatment was required.|$|E
500|$|Under Dunn's experience, {{the band}} instituted some traditions that the {{university}} uses to the present. In 1925, Marvin H. Mimms wrote the lyrics for an alma mater for the school. Dunn, who found the Aggie War Hymn [...] "inappropriate" [...] for social functions and solemn occasions, wrote its accompanying music and presented it to the student body titled Spirit of Aggieland. In 1926, the tradition of Elephant Walk began when two seniors in the band led a procession of seniors throughout the school grounds visiting all the important places on campus. All the seniors in one single file was [...] "quite a site to behold", and one junior commented that they looked {{like a bunch of}} old elephants wandering <b>around</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find some place to die. The name stuck and the tradition continues to the present.|$|E

[...] Sassone's only {{complaint}} was that the Jack, Nancy, and Avery love triangle be over, pointing {{out that he was}} sick of seeing Jack running <b>around</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> keep Avery and Nancy from seeing each other. IGN contributor Robert Canning said that [...] "we got one of the best episode titles of any show this year", and was favorable to the guest spots from Jon Hamm, Dean Winters, and Michael Sheen, observing [...] "he episode joyfully gave us three great pairings for Liz to deal with, each presenting their own unique set of laughs." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9 out of 10 rating. Linda Holmes for National Public Radio said that [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land" [...] was [...] "very funny", and commented that her favorite scene was when Liz visited Drew in hopes that the two can get back together.|$|E

It's kind of exhilarating for that reason," [...] he said. The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. [...] "It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them," [...] Cameron stated. [...] "They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot." [...] Cameron said he and his crew [...] "were just trying to find things to shoot" [...] because the big set [...] "wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling <b>around</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> fill in anything we could get to shoot." [...] After seeing the scene on film, Cameron felt it worked out considerably well.|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the music}} video began {{during the week of}} January 25, 2010, in Los Angeles. It was filmed at Universal CityWalk by {{director}} Ray Kay, who had previously directed videos for Beyoncé Knowles, Lady Gaga, Alexandra Burke, and Cheryl Cole, among others. Ludacris said that the video [...] "is like a 2010 version of Michael Jackson's [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel"." [...] Bieber said that the video [...] "will capture the song's message of trying to woo back a girl." [...] In explaining the concept of the video, Bieber said, [...] "It starts off, I really like this girl, but we didn't [...] along; we couldn't be together. Basically I want her back and [...] kind of going through the whole thing. I'm chasing her <b>around,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get her, and she's kind of playing hard to get, but I'm persistent. I keep going." [...] The video premiered exclusively on Vevo on Friday, February 19, 2010. Singer and actress Jasmine Villegas portrays Bieber's love interest in the video.

500|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} by the Kinks at least twice {{in the summer of}} 1964. The band's demo was in a [...] "bluesy" [...] style, while a full studio version recorded in June was slower and less emphatic than the final single. Although the band wanted to rerecord the song, their record company Pye refused to fund another session {{on the grounds that the}} band's first two singles had failed to chart. Ray Davies, however, hated the original recording of the track, threatening that he would refuse to perform or promote the single unless it was rerecorded. Manager Larry Page also refused to publish the original recording. When Pye stood its ground, the band's own management broke the stalemate by funding the session themselves. Ray Davies' adamant attitude on behalf of the career-making song effectively established him as the leader and chief songwriter of the Kinks. Davies later said, [...] "I was floundering <b>around</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find an identity. It was in 1964 that I managed to do that, to be able to justify myself and say, 'I exist, I'm here.' I was literally born when that song hit." ...|$|E
500|$|Initial {{reviews of}} the episode were mixed. After the episode aired, Silber was {{disappointed}} in its resolution, writing, [...] "This episode adeptly combines surrealism {{and a sense of}} impending climax—only to sputter out in disappointment when nothing much gets resolved at the end." [...] He dismissed [...] "Mulder's one-week recovery from his horrifying ordeal" [...] as [...] "facile and unconvincing". He did write that Mulder's dream provided [...] "credible insight into the recesses of his troubled personality". The X-Files researcher and independent reviewer Sarah Stegall awarded the episode a three out of five score after the episode aired. She argued that, in the episode, Mulder [...] "is not a martyr but a victim" [...] which makes him [...] "pitiable, not heroic". Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, gave the episode a positive review, noting that the [...] "Duchovny-penned final scene is exquisite in showcasing the beauty and power of Mulder and Scully's evolving relationship." [...] He deemed Mulder's dream sequences [...] "inspired television" [...] and felt that the episode left itself open to interpretation. In the October 2000 issue of Cinefantastique, writer Paula Vitaris gave the episode a mixed review, awarding it two stars out of four. She criticized the recycling of the [...] "one partner lies comatose while the other runs <b>around</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find a cure" [...] storyline, but she was more positive towards Mulder's reverie, calling it visually [...] "beautiful".|$|E
500|$|Rick Thames, {{editor of}} The Charlotte Observer, criticized the book's {{packaging}} calling the cover as [...] "tacky, hot pink-and-acid green sleeves, featuring an unflattering {{photo of the}} dished artist." [...] Barry Didcock from Sunday Herald felt that [...] "Morton [...] to find the face of Madonna." [...] He criticized Morton's sketchy portrayal of Madonna's relationship with deceased painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, saying [...] "he commits an error by doing so because, unusually for Madonna, this was a relationship of equals." [...] Gregg Barrios from Daily Star was critical of the book, saying [...] " [...] The fatal flaw of these quickie knockoffs {{is that they have}} no real ending or any way of predicting what the fates have in store for Madonna Louise Penn [...] nee Ciccone. Once the next Madonna tour, CD, marriage or film appears, their shelf life is cut short." [...] Barbara Ellen from The Guardian criticized Morton's writing by saying, [...] "Andrew Morton achieves the implausible: he takes an interesting woman and an astonishing life and makes them both seem incredibly boring in his life of Madonna.... Once you get used to Morton's pace (dull plod, with occasional snooze), it becomes quite amusing joining him on the journey, a bit like watching someone dragging a dead body <b>around,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find some place to hide it. Even luminaries such as Madonna exes Sean Penn and Warren Beatty are reduced to flailing around like disenfranchised phantoms in the shallows of Morton's blandly automatic insight." ...|$|E

While the other residents were running <b>around</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get information, she was so busy working on the free clinic project that she hadn’t even heard he was retiring." [...] The story of the two Amish girls was deemed [...] "a little side story, which was actually quite touching and well written", being praised for the realistic portrayals and the effects the storyline had on Stevens. [...] "I don't think I've ever realized that Callie and Cristina never really interacted before. When they did speak to one another the episode, their personalities clash right away. At first they were snippy to one another but the two bonded after slicing open a runner's legs and then operating on him.", assessed West, in {{response to}} Torres and Yang's arc, which was described as [...] "an obvious parallel {{to the rest of the}} episode". West compared the reaction of Yang and Torres following the proposals, by noting that the former was [...] "surprised and maybe a little bit touched", whereas Torres expressed fear and concern: [...] "She's worried that he's only proposing because he's still getting over the loss of his dad and just needs someone to cling to.

2500|$|The correct {{interpretation}} of Mill's footnote {{is a matter}} of some debate. The difficulty in interpretation centres <b>around</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> explain why, since it is consequences that matter, intentions should {{play a role in the}} assessment of the morality of an action but motives should not. One possibility [...] "involves supposing that the 'morality' of the act is one thing, probably to do with the praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the agent, and its rightness or wrongness another." [...] Jonathan Dancy rejects this interpretation on the grounds that Mill is explicitly making intention relevant to an assessment of the act not to an assessment of the agent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game is a}} fast-paced {{combination}} of speed, athleticism, skill and physical toughness. Players are allowed to tackle the player with the ball and impede opposition players from tackling their teammates (known as shepherding), but not to deliberately strike an opponent (though pushing the margins of these rules is often {{a substantial part of}} the game). Like most team sports, tactics are based <b>around</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get the ball, then [...] through a {{combination of}} running with the ball, hand-passing (punching the ball from the open palm of the other hand) and kicking [...] to deliver it to a player who is within range of goal. Because taking a mark entitles the player to a free kick, a common tactic is to attempt to kick the ball on the full (without bouncing) to a teammate who is within kicking range of goal. In this situation, packs of players often form around the goal square, and the opportunity arises for spectacular marks in which players launch themselves off opponents' backs to mark the ball, high in the air. This particular skill is highly regarded as a spectacle, and an annual [...] "Mark of the Year" [...] is awarded {{at the end of a}} season.|$|E

[...] He stated he was no longer going to use Anberlin to name his first daughter, however he said, [...] "If I ever have a daughter and name her Anberlin, she'll think she was named after the band instead of the other way around." [...] Christian had also stated in another interview that the band's name was created when he was thinking about cities in Europe he wanted to visit. In his mind he listed [...] "London, Paris, Rome, and Berlin." [...] Christian thought that [...] "and Berlin" [...] would be an appropriate name for a band, and so when the band was looking for a name Christian suggested [...] "And Berlin," [...] which was then modified to [...] "Anberlin." ...|$|E
