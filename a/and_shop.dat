5|$|The John Deere House <b>and</b> <b>Shop</b> is {{historically}} significant for its {{influence in the}} areas of commerce, agriculture, industry, and invention. The site was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark on July 19, 1964. The Landmark designation was assigned by the U.S. Department of Interior because of the House and Shop's association with John Deere, founder of the John Deere Company and inventor of the first steel plow. His invention was of significance to the entire United States and made large scale cultivation of areas in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio possible. When the U.S. National Register of Historic Places was established in 1966 the John Deere House <b>and</b> <b>Shop</b> was among the first properties to join that list. It was added to the National Register on October 15, 1966, the same day the National Register was established.|$|E

5|$|Although {{short fiction}} had been popular {{as far back}} as the Tang dynasty (618–907), and the works of {{contemporaneous}} authors such as Xu Guangqi, Xu Xiake, and Song Yingxing were often technical and encyclopedic, the most striking literary development was the vernacular novel. While the gentry elite were educated enough to fully comprehend the language of Classical Chinese, those with rudimentary education – such as women in educated families, merchants, <b>and</b> <b>shop</b> clerks – became a large potential audience for literature and performing arts that employed Vernacular Chinese. Literati scholars edited or developed major Chinese novels into mature form in this period, such as Water Margin and Journey to the West. Jin Ping Mei, published in 1610, although incorporating earlier material, marks the trend toward independent composition and concern with psychology. In the later years of the dynasty, Feng Menglong and Ling Mengchu innovated with vernacular short fiction. Theater scripts were equally imaginative. The most famous, The Peony Pavilion, was written by Tang Xianzu (1550–1616), with its first performance at the Pavilion of Prince Teng in 1598.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} if the castle and town played any {{part in the}} English Civil War between 1642–45, {{although}} cannonballs from the period have been discovered within the castle.

Stones from the castle were used for local building work by the 17th century onwards, and by the 18th century a house <b>and</b> <b>shop</b> had been constructed in the eastern bailey of the castle, along with a yard and garden. A gallows operated at the castle until 1790. Buildings continued to encroach on the castle. By {{the end of the}} 19th century a school and a house, Castle Lodge, had been built in the castle grounds. Other buildings were built as lean-to's against the castle walls.|$|E
