5|$|Jamaican {{officials}} issued {{radio and}} television advisories for residents in low-lying areas, urging them to be ready and evacuate if necessary. The Jamaican government opened all shelters {{on the island and}} placed its armed forces on standby. Long lines for storm supplies were reported at local businesses ahead of the storm <b>as</b> <b>residents</b> rushed to obtain supplies in preparation for Ernesto's onslaught. When a tropical storm warning was put in effect for Jamaica and the central Bahamas, cruise ship companies indicated they were diverting several liners to avoid the storm.|$|E
5|$|On December30, just a {{day before}} Waka passed through Tonga, {{warnings}} were issued for numerous islands, including parts of Fiji and Samoa.

5|$|The {{city had}} a {{population}} of 277,140 as of the 2010 Census, retaining its position as the largest city {{in the state and}} making it the nation's 67th-most populous municipality. After reaching a peak of 442,337 residents counted in the 1930 Census, the city's population saw a decline of nearly 40% <b>as</b> <b>residents</b> moved to surrounding suburbs, with the increase in 2010 of 3,594 (+1.3%) from the 273,546 counted in the 2000 Census marking the second census in 70 years in which the city's population had grown from the previous enumeration.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{federal highway}} {{subsidies}} and postwar development encouraged outward migration <b>as</b> <b>residents</b> moved to gain newer housing; this suburbanization significantly reduced the city's middle-class population. The city made {{efforts to create}} new attractions, such as the Gateway Arch, which construction became a focus {{of the civil rights}} movement to gain non-segregated jobs in the skilled trades. The first litigation under the 1964 Civil Rights Act was against St. Louis unions. The city worked to replace substandard housing by new public housing projects such as PruittIgoe. A combination of factors resulted in this being notoriously unsuccessful, and it was demolished in the late 20th century. Starting in the 1980s and continuing into the following century, construction and gentrification have increased in some areas of St. Louis, particularly downtown. City beautification and crime reduction have made progress, although St. Louis has continued to struggle with crime and perceptions of crime. The city saw modest population growth during the mid-2000s, but showed a decline in the 2010 U.S. Census.|$|E
5|$|Cabral's discovery, {{and even}} his resting place {{in the land of}} his birth, had been almost {{completely}} forgotten during the span of nearly 300 years since his expedition. This began to change beginning in the 1840s when Emperor Dom Pedro II, successor and son of Pedro I, sponsored research and publications dealing with Cabral's life and expedition through the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute. This was part of the Emperor's ambitious larger plan to foster and strengthen a sense of nationalism among Brazil's diverse citizenry—giving them a common identity and history <b>as</b> <b>residents</b> of a unique Portuguese-speaking empire, surrounded by Hispanic-American Republics. The initial resurgence of interest in Cabral had resulted from the rediscovery, in 1839, of his resting place by the Brazilian historian Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen (later Viscount of Porto Seguro). The completely neglected state in which Cabral's tomb was found nearly led to a diplomatic crisis between Brazil and Portugal—the latter then ruled by Pedro II's eldest sister, Maria II.|$|E

5|$|On August23, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{deployed}} 717 personnel, {{mainly from}} the disaster response team, to the affected regions in the United States. The following day, 564 National Guard troops were deployed in the state. In the days following the storm, many mosquitoes and other insects laid eggs in areas of standing water, causing a large increase in their numbers. Authorities sprayed insecticide to minimize the potential for disease outbreaks. By August25, all shelters opened prior to Bret were closed <b>as</b> <b>residents</b> were allowed to return home. On August26, President Bill Clinton added the counties of Brooks, Duval, Jim Wells and Webb to the major disaster declaration area. This allowed residents in those counties to receive federal funding.|$|E
5|$|Several {{writers and}} {{politicians}} {{are associated with}} Fleet Street, either <b>as</b> <b>residents</b> or regulars to the various taverns, including Ben Jonson, John Milton, Izaak Walton, John Dryden, Edmund Burke, Oliver Goldsmith and Charles Lamb.

The cartographer John Senex owned a map store, The Sign of the Globe, on Fleet Street between 1725 and his death in 1736. Wynkyn de Worde was buried in St. Bride's Church in 1535, as was poet Richard Lovelace in 1657, while Samuel Pepys was baptised there in 1633.|$|E
5|$|The Bermuda Electric Light Company Limited {{recommended}} Bermuda {{residents to}} buy hurricane supplies such as candles, batteries, and non-perishable foods, to fill bathtubs and extra containers with water, and fill gasoline tanks for automobiles. In preparation, residents formed long lines at gas stations, banks, and supermarkets. All government offices and many businesses {{closed on the}} day prior to the hurricane hitting. All schools were closed, while all flights {{in and out of}} the island were canceled. Officials opened emergency shelters, and recommended 2,000 low-lying residents to evacuate; a hotel on the south shore of the island was evacuated as well. Several cruise ships expected to remain on the island departed early to avoid the hurricane. Local insurance companies on Bermuda experienced a great increase in business, <b>as</b> <b>residents</b> renewed lapsed policies or signed up for new policies for homes or businesses, though marine policies were stopped several days before the hurricane struck. The arrival of Fabian forced the cancellation or delay of several sports events, including a cricket match, a football game, and a dinghy race.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the Saipan, 50 power lines, 20 transformers, and 6 {{power poles}} were damaged or destroyed, leaving 25{{percent of the}} islands' {{residents}} without power and $300,000 in damages. An estimated 90 percent of the banana trees were knocked down, contributing to the $518,000 in crop losses. Property losses on the two islands was estimated at $1.6million. On the islands of Alamagan, Pagan, and Agrihan all private homes, a total of six, were destroyed, the food stores and crops were lost, and the water supply was contaminated. The main public facility, which {{was used as a}} storm shelter on Alamagan, sustained heavy damage. Damages from the three islands amounted to $500,000. The following day, five people went out kayaking however, the rough seas overturned the kayaks and all five drowned. Numerous water rescues on jet skis had to be made <b>as</b> <b>residents</b> became stranded in their cars after driving into flooded roads.

5|$|A {{year after}} the freeway opened, traffic volumes along {{parallel}} roads like 44th, 56th and 68th streets dropped 40–50%. At the same time, roads with interchanges along the freeway saw increased traffic. Wilson Avenue experienced a 120% increase and sections of Byron Center Avenue jumped 100% in traffic levels a month after M-6 opened. Property values in the townships surrounding the freeway increased 11.3–12.4% by 2006 {{as a result of}} development attached to the freeway. Local officials credited the freeway for increased access to the area, driving housing starts <b>as</b> <b>residents</b> flocked to the communities for their schools and quality of life. In 2007, the Metro Health Village, a commercial development centered around the Byron Center Avenue exit and the hospital opened. Described as being similar to a mall with the hospital as a tenant, the village features restaurants, shops, offices and a hotel. Metro Health relocated from Grand Rapids to the location in Wyoming in the face of opposition to planned expansions of their previous location. Since opening, even though the freeway was officially named for Paul Henry, the original South Beltline name is still in use.|$|E
5|$|In Acapulco, {{which had}} already {{suffered}} severe damage due to a harsh rainy season, residents piled sandbags in preparation for more precipitation. Ten shipping ports were closed. Over 240 people were evacuated {{in the state of}} Jalisco, 140 of which from the village of La Huerta. In addition, up to 850 people sought refuge in shelters across the state. Some 350 people from the municipality of Coahuayana and 150 people from the city of Coalcomán de Vázquez Pallares – both in Michoacán state – were moved to safety. Merchants taped their store windows to protect them from strong winds while residents stocked up on water. In Cabo San Lucas on the southern tip of Baja California, authorities began evacuating low-lying areas <b>as</b> <b>residents</b> and tourists flooded supermarkets. Gas stations were filled with lines up to 0.5mi (0.8km) long. All traffic was closed to the ports of Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo. The Red Cross opened shelters at several local schools. Municipal authorities issued a red alert. Army and Navy representatives met to discuss rescue operations. About 1,000 people sought refuge in shelters across Cabo San Lucas and nearby San Jose del Cabo as the storm arrived. Most airline flights were canceled, frustrating tourists.|$|E

5|$|Issues {{regarding}} {{debt and}} revenue-sharing within the Netherlands Antilles {{eventually led to}} the dissolution of the territory and its division as constituent islands Curaçao and Sint Maarten claimed a status of autonomy similar to that of Aruba, while the islands Bonaire, Saba, and Sint Eustatius were absorbed directly into the Netherlands. Thus, the 2008 Summer Olympics served as the final Olympics games in which the Netherlands Antilles participated as a territory. The future of the Dutch Antillean athletes to participate in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London were cast into doubt as a result. <b>As</b> <b>residents</b> of the Netherlands Antilles hold Dutch passports, IAAF General Secretary Pierre Weiss remarked all former Dutch Antillean athletes should immediately become eligible to represent the Netherlands in the Netherlands Antilles' stead. Ultimately, however, the IOC decided in its 123rd session upon three items: that former Dutch Antillean athletes would compete independently under the Olympic flag; that recognition for the Netherlands Antilles' Olympic Committee was to be withdrawn; and that a temporary administrative structure would serve in the Dutch Antillean NOC's place until after the 2012 London games, directly supervised and supported by the IOC.|$|E
5|$|Garcia de Orta was {{responsible}} for building the manor-house (Bombay Castle) in Bombay. He also mentioned several accounts of the islands and {{the people living in}} Bombay during his time. During his regime, as regards the population of the island, Bombay was composed of seven villages subordinate to two cacabas (kashas) or chief stations, at which customs-duty was levied. These villages were Mahim, Parel, Varella (Wadala) and Syva (Sion) under the kasba (chief officer) of Mahim, and Mazagaon, Bombaim (Bombay), and Varel (Worli) under the kasba (chief officer) of Bombay. In addition to these, there were smaller hamlets like Cavel, Colaba, Naigaon and Dongri, which had existed from the epoch of indigenous Hindu settlement. The Kolis, a fishing community, formed the most numerous class of people, and dwelt in most parts of Bombay from Colaba in the south to Sion and Mahim in the north. Other Hindu communities residing were, the Kunbis and Agris (Curumbins) (who cultivated the fields and sowed them with rice and all sorts of pulse), the Malis (who tended the orchards), and the Piaes (men-at-arms) (who were Bhandaris). The Parus (Prabhus) dwelt in Mahim, Bombay, and Parel. They collected the rents of the King and of the inhabitants and their estates, and were also merchants. The Muslim Moors in Bombay were solely engaged in maritime trade. A few Muslims of less mixed descent were living in Mahim, but the bulk of the followers of Islam belonged to the Konkani Muslim community. Christians residing in Bombay during his time included eleven Roman Catholic Portuguese families of married men. The other three communities mentioned by Orta <b>as</b> <b>residents</b> in Bassein and its surrounding tracts were Baneanes (Banias), Coaris or Esparcis (Parsis), and Deres (Dheds or Mahars) or Farazes. Most Banias and Parsis did not actually settle in Bombay until after its cession to England by the Portuguese. Bombay apparently remained in Orta's possession until his peaceful death in Goa in 1570. Several years later, his bones were exhumed and burnt at the stake for his Jewish faith. The islands appears to have been granted on the same tenure to several Portuguese officials in succession.|$|E
5|$|The first {{nationalist}} tensions {{arise in}} the 19th century, with {{the outbreak of the}} First Serbian Uprising in present-day central Serbia. The Turks construct a blockhouse on the bridge, decorating it with stakes on which they pin the heads of suspected rebels. One evening, the blockhouse burns down. In the ensuing decades, as the Ottoman Empire continues to decline, Bosnia is ravaged by plague. After the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Serbia and Montenegro become fully independent countries. Austria-Hungary receives a right to occupy Bosnia-Herzegovina and turns it into a protectorate. The occupation comes as a shock to the residents of the town, which has remained largely unchanged since the time of the bridge's completion, and the local people experience difficulties accepting the numerous changes and reforms that accompany Austro-Hungarian rule. A barrack is built {{at the site of the}} caravanserai and the town experiences a substantial influx of foreigners. People from all parts of Austria-Hungary arrive, opening new businesses and bringing the customs of their native regions with them. A narrow gauge railway line is built to Sarajevo and the bridge loses much of its strategic importance. Local children begin to be educated in Sarajevo, and some go on to continue their studies in Vienna. They bring home new social and cultural ideas from abroad, among them the concepts of trade unions and socialism, while newly established newspapers acquaint the town's inhabitants with nationalism. Tensions flare following the assassination of Empress Elisabeth of Austria in 1898. In 1908, Austria-Hungary formally annexes Bosnia-Herzegovina, sparking tensions with Serbia, which the Austro-Hungarians come to regard as a serious obstacle to their further conquest of the eastern Balkans. The Balkan Wars of 1912–13 see the Ottomans almost completely forced from the region, and relations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia deteriorate further. The significance of the middle portion of the bridge also becomes undermined, <b>as</b> <b>residents</b> of different ethnicities become suspicious and wary of one another.|$|E
