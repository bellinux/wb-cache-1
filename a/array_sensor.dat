40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{advent of}} GMR {{magnetic}} sensors and GMR <b>sensor</b> <b>arrays</b> with frequency-independent sensitivity offers improvements in speed, depth, and resolution in eddy-current testing. Arrays of GMR magnetic sensors allow rapid scanning {{of an area}} for defects in a single pass. The small size and low power consumption of these solid-state magnetic sensors enable the fabrication of compact <b>arrays</b> of <b>sensors</b> on circuit boards and even on-chip <b>sensor</b> <b>arrays.</b> Arrays have been fabricated with sensor spacing as small as 5 micrometers when fine resolution is required. GMR sensor elements can be deposited on active silicon substrates facilitating on-chip signal processing and multiplexing. This integration simplifies the sensor/signal-processing interface, minimizes the number of leads, and can reduce the effect of noise. This paper will discuss the technology of fabricating <b>arrays</b> on GMR <b>sensors,</b> especially on-chip <b>arrays.</b> Integrated <b>sensor</b> <b>arrays</b> with on-chip signal processing and multiplexing will be described. Finally, some applications of arrays to crack and corrosion detection will be discussed...|$|R
