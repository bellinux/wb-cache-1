40|$|Shading windows {{has been}} shown to reduce energy costs by {{reducing}} temperatures inside of buildings. Previous studies focused on office buildings and shades that respond to changing light levels, and found that <b>automatic</b> <b>window</b> shades are more effective at reducing temperature than manual shades. Few studies have been done on the effectiveness of reducing temperature with window shades controlled by motion detectors, however, motion detectors have been found to reduce energy consumption from lighting systems. To see if motion detectors are also effective at reducing temperature when used with window shades, this study focused on a cheap, easy to install <b>automatic</b> <b>window</b> shade that uses a motion detector to open only when the room is occupied. It was found that the window shade with a motion detector had no effect on the temperature of the room. However, there was a strong correlation found between the temperature of the room and the inside temperature of the house, possibly due to inadequate isolation of the experimental room during testing. Further study is recommended that addresses this issue before the effectiveness of the window shade is determined...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Every {{year about}} 400 people die in submersed {{vehicles}} in North America and this number increases to 2, 000 – 5, 000 in all industrialized nations. The {{best way to}} survive is to quickly exit through the windows. An <b>Automatic</b> <b>Window</b> Opening System (AWOS; patent protected) was designed to sense when a vehicle is in water and to open the electric windows, but only when the vehicle is upright. Methods: The AWOS consists of a Detection Module (DM), in the engine compartment, and a Power Window Control Module (PWCM) inside the driver’s door. The DM contains a Water Sensor, a Level Sensor and a Microcontroller Unit (MCU). The Level Sensor provides the angular orientation of the car using a 3 -axis acceleration sensor and prevents <b>automatic</b> <b>window</b> opening if the car is outside the orientation range (± 20 ° in the roll axis, ± 30 ° in the pitch axis, with a 2 s delay). Systems were installed on two cars and one SUV. A crane lowered vehicles in water either straight down (static tests) or by swinging the vehicles to produce forward movement (dynamic tests). Results: In all tests, when the vehicles landed upright, windows opened immediately and effectively. When vehicles landed inverted, or at a very steep angle, the system did not engage until an upright and level position was attained. Conclusions: This system may help decrease drowning deaths in sinking vehicles. If occupants do not know, or forget, what to do, the open window could hopefully prompt them to exit safely through that window...|$|E

40|$|An {{approach}} {{to the design of}} active window shades is developed to control the direct solar gain through a window. Using simple actuation hardware and sensors, a control strategy is presented that automatically adjusts window shades to save HVAC energy by controlling direct solar radiation passing through a window. The control algorithm is based on a simple approach that admits direct light in the winter and blocks the direct light in the summer, while providing shade adjustment that affords maximum visibility through the window. Cloudy skies or indirect sun result in horizontal placement of the shades, and the shades close at night. The implementation uses two thin-film photovoltaic cells as sensors and a control algorithm that is independent of the window orientation, latitude, or solar time, so that it operates properly in any installation location. Preliminary analytic and test results show significant energy savings when the <b>automatic</b> <b>window</b> shades are compared with a window without shades, and with a window outfitted with fixed horizontal shades...|$|E
40|$|Twenty terrace houses {{without a}} {{traditional}} heating {{system has been}} built in Lindås, Sweden. The houses are extremely well insulated and very airtight. They are equipped with a high efficiency ventilation heat recovery system. Each house also has a 5 m 2 solar collector {{that is designed to}} cover 50 % of the energy supply for hot water use. The total electricity consumption and the air temperature have on an hourly base been monitored in two positions for each of the houses. Further has the environmental conditions, i. e. outdoor temperature, wind, sun etc been monitored. In six of the houses separate measurements of electricity consumption for ventilation and hot water has also been performed. In these six houses also the temperature and humidity in the bathrooms has been measured. One of the houses has been used for more extensive measurements. In this house the presence of inhabitants has been simulated by the use of electrically heated manikins. Humidity gain is achieved by remote controlled showering in the bathroom. During the summer of 2003 an <b>automatic</b> <b>window</b> airing system was also introduced. The results show that the mean value of the indoor air temperatures in most cases is equivalent to or higher than those expected in houses with a traditional heating system. The fluctuations are however sometimes a little bit larger. The total energy use is on an average much lower than for a traditional house with a heating system, but still higher than estimated when designing the houses. The heat from household electricity consumption is in most cases more than sufficient to keep the indoor climate within acceptable limits. However, some additional heat source is required for some periods during wintertime. For these houses most of the heat required can be supplied through a small reheater in the air-handling unit. In the actual case, the reheaters in the gable houses should have been larger and some additional heater in the upper bathroom would have increased the thermal comfort. The air-handling unit control system did initially not work properly. In spring, summer, autumn and sometimes even in the wintertime, window airing is necessary to keep the indoor air temperature down to a reasonable level. The <b>automatic</b> <b>window</b> airing system showed promising results. The conclusion is {{that it is possible to}} build well-insulated and very airtight houses without a traditional heating system in a Nordic climate. Pris: 500 /CD 200 SEK.

40|$|Online (also 'real-time' or 'sequential') signal {{extraction}} from {{noisy and}} outlier- interfered data streams {{is a basic}} but challenging goal. Fitting a robust Repeated Median (Siegel, 1982) regression line in a moving time window {{has turned out to}} be a promising approach (Davies et al., 2004; Gather et al., 2006; Schettlinger et al., 2006). The level of the regression line at the rightmost window position, which equates to the current time point in an online application, is then used as signal extraction. However, the choice of the window width has large impact on the signal extraction, and it is impossible to predetermine an optimal fixed window width for data streams which exhibit signal changes like level shifts and sudden trend changes. We therefore propose a robust test procedure for the online detection of such signal changes. An algorithm including the test allows for online window width adaption, meaning that the window width is chosen w. r. t. the current data situation at each time point. Comparison studies show that our new procedure outperforms an existing Repeated Median filter with <b>automatic</b> <b>window</b> width selection (Schettlinger et al., 2010) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses a {{forensic}} building performance evaluation approach {{to undertake a}} comparative evaluation of the in-use energy and environmental performance data (collected over two years) of two civic buildings located in Southeast England – a small community centre (< 1000 m 2) and a medium-sized public library building (~ 4500 m 2), which are designed to high sustainability standards (EPC A rating) and low heating demand met by on-site low/zero carbon technologies. Although both buildings achieved measured air-permeability rates of ~ 5 m 3 /hr. m 2, they encountered similar issues related to poor documentation of ‘as-built’ drawings, poor handover and guidance, problems with integrating and maintaining new technologies (heat pumps, biomass boilers and solar thermal), lack of calibration of sub-meters, and issues with <b>automatic</b> <b>window</b> controls. However the actual carbon emissions of the community centre are double the predicted, while they are almost five times {{in the case of}} library building.

40|$|Pre-filtering is a {{critical}} step in 3 -D segmentation of the blood vessel and its display. This paper presents the local effect of window/level over the 3 -D scale-space approach for filtering the white blood angiographic volumes and its implementation issues. The raw MR angiographic volume is first converted to an isotropic volume, and then the window/level is automatically adjusted slice by slice and a composite volume is generated. Then, 3 -D edges are generated using the separable Gaussian derivative convolution with known scales. The edge volume is then run by the directional processor at each voxel where the eigenvalues of the 3 -D ellipsoid are computed. The vessel score per voxel is then estimated based on these three eigenvalues which suppress the non-vasculature and background structures, yielding the filtered volume. The filtered volume is ray-cast to generate the maximum intensity projection images for display. The performance {{of the system is}} evaluated by computing the mean, variance, SNR and CNR images. We compare the filtering results with and without the usage of the local effect of window/level over 3 -D scalespace ellipsoidal filtering.

Therefore, wide adoption of such modeling could create significant cost savings for consumers. Second, the findings are promising for the further development of more intelligent HEMS in the residential sector. Third, we formulated a smart grid valuation framework that is helpful for interpreting the model’s results concerning the efficiency of current smart appliances and their respective prices.
