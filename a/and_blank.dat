The limited time between the planned reburials in February 2010, and the opening of the cemetery, meant that the grassed areas would need to be turfed, instead of growing the grass from seeds.

The 10-year-old Bach moved in with his eldest brother, Johann Christoph Bach (1671–1721), the organist at St.Michael's Church in Ohrdruf, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. There he studied, performed, and copied music, {{including}} his own brother's, despite being forbidden to do so because scores were so valuable and private <b>and</b> <b>blank</b> ledger paper of that type was costly. He received valuable teaching from his brother, who instructed him on the clavichord. J.C.Bach exposed him to the works of great composers of the day, including South German composers such as Johann Pachelbel (under whom Johann Christoph had studied) and Johann Jakob Froberger; North German composers; Frenchmen, such as Jean-Baptiste Lully, Louis Marchand, and Marin Marais; and the Italian clavierist Girolamo Frescobaldi. Also during this time, he was taught theology, Latin, Greek, French, and Italian at the local gymnasium.|$|E
25|$|Infocom {{was a game}} {{development}} company formed in June 1979 by, among others, Dave Lebling, Marc Blank, Tim Anderson, Bruce Daniels, and Albert Vezza. Lebling <b>and</b> <b>Blank</b> were students at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science {{at the time of}} Colossal Cave Adventures release. Desiring to create a similar game, they worked alongside fellow students Anderson and Daniels to create the text adventure Zork for the PDP-10 minicomputer, distributed via ARPANET. On graduation the students, together with their group leader Albert Vezza, decided to form Inforcom to port Zork for home computers, As with Adams, Infocom was also limited by the size of memory on home computers at the time like the Apple II and TRS-80. They broke up Zork into three episodes to manage the size, and then created the Zork Implementation Language (ZIL) and the Z-machine to run ZIL programs, the first virtual machine used in a commercial product. Zork was very successful, with the first episode Zork I released in 1980 and selling nearly 380,000 copies by 1986.|$|E

500|$|Phoenix is {{the home}} of a unique {{architectural}} tradition and community. Frank Lloyd Wright moved to Phoenix in 1937 and built his winter home, Taliesin West, and the main campus for The Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture. Over the years, Phoenix has attracted notable architects who have made it their home and have grown successful practices. These architectural studios embrace the desert climate, and are unconventional in their approach to the practice of design. They include the Paolo Soleri (who created Arcosanti), Al Beadle, Will Bruder, Wendell Burnette, <b>and</b> <b>Blank</b> Studio architectural design studios. Another major force in architectural landscape of the city was Ralph Haver whose firm, Haver & Nunn, designed commercial, industrial and residential structures throughout the valley.

Most of the items on display were imports from the United States but their relatively high cost reduced their attractiveness to the casual buyer. The commercial success and mass market potential of the ZX80 caught Rowland's interest; he approached Sinclair, saw a prototype ZX81 and agreed to market the machine through Smith's on an exclusive basis for the first six months after launch. As Rowland put it, [...] "what we've done now is bring the computer-orientated publications together with an actual computer, to create the Computer Know-How section of the store", alongside computer software <b>and</b> <b>blank</b> cassette tapes.

500|$|The first map to be {{prepared}} according to Wright's projection was published in his book, and showed the route of Cumberland's expedition to the Azores. A manuscript version of this map is preserved at Hatfield House; it {{is believed to have}} been drawn about 1595. Following this, Wright created a new world map, the first map of the globe to be produced in England and the first to use the Mercator projection since Gerardus Mercator's 1569 original. Based on Molyneux's terrestrial globe, it corrected a number of errors in the earlier work by Mercator. The map, often called the Wright–Molyneux Map, first appeared in the second volume of Richard Hakluyt's The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation (1599). Unlike many contemporary maps and charts which contained fantastic speculations about unexplored lands, Wright's map has a minimum of detail <b>and</b> <b>blank</b> areas wherever information was lacking. The map was one of the earliest to use the name [...] "Virginia". Shakespeare alluded to the map in Twelfth Night (1600–1601), when Maria says of Malvolio: [...] "He does smile his face into more lynes, than is in the new Mappe, with the augmentation of the Indies." [...] Another world map, larger and with updated details, appeared in the second edition of Certaine Errors (1610).|$|E
