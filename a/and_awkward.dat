5|$|Though {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} ungainly <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> when on the ground, {{the anatomy of}} some pterosaurs (particularly pterodactyloids) suggests that they were competent walkers and runners. Early pterosaurs have long been considered particularly cumbersome locomotors due {{to the presence of}} large cruropatagia, but they too appear to have been generally efficient on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Himmler's first name, Heinrich, {{was that}} of his godfather, Prince Heinrich of Bavaria, {{a member of the}} royal family of Bavaria, who had been tutored by Gebhard Himmler. He {{attended}} a grammar school in Landshut, where his father was deputy principal. While he did well in his schoolwork, he struggled in athletics. He had poor health, suffering from lifelong stomach complaints and other ailments. In his youth he trained daily with weights and exercised to become stronger. Other boys at the school later remembered him as studious <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> in social situations.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{talks with}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) about his going to {{marriage}} counseling with Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), and Pam {{does the same}} with Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Toby points out to Jim {{that it is not}} fair to tell Pam that he needs an indeterminate amount of time before Athlead pays off for the family; Pam vents to Nellie that Jim is always making unilateral decisions involving her and they each agree they are not leaving Philly for Scranton or vice versa. The Halperts leave the office looking sad <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> together.|$|E

5|$|Sol quickly {{falls for}} Naz when they meet, but his anger threatens their relationship. Sol {{has never met}} a girl like Naz before, and Cole said Naz {{probably}} has not met boys like Sol before either. Hussen said {{that there is something}} about Sol that attracts Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that Sol is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between Sol and Naz. Cole found it tough <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later on, but said that the scene was awkward anyway so {{he did not have to}} act much for it. Sol has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved.|$|E
5|$|The Smith Gun {{was capable}} of firing both anti-personnel and {{anti-tank}} rounds (the latter capable of penetrating some 60mm of armour), and provided the Home Guard and local defence units with a potentially potent anti-personnel and anti-armour weapon. However, there were several flaws in its design, and as such it was not well liked {{by some of the}} Home Guard units to which it was issued. It was heavy <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> to manhandle, particularly over rough ground and in urban areas; in the latter, it was recommended that toggle ropes be used to manoeuvre the weapon into position. The low muzzle velocity meant that shells were lobbed in a high curved trajectory, making precise range calculations and firing experience vital. This was difficult when so few rounds were available for training, a problem compounded by early batches possessing faulty fuzes that led to the Smith Gun's alleged 'terrifying reputation for killing its crew'. (This probably arises from the first fatal malfunction when, during a live-fire exercise in 1942, Corporal Maynard of 2819 Squadron, RAF Regiment was killed in an explosion.|$|E
5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E

25|$|Stibine {{is used in}} the {{semiconductor}} industry to dope silicon with small quantities of antimony via the process of chemical vapour deposition (CVD). It has also been used as a silicon dopant in epitaxial layers. Reports claim the use of SbH3 as a fumigant but its instability <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> preparation contrast with the more conventional fumigant phosphine.|$|E

25|$|The {{cancellation}} of the unbuilt northern section from the M25 in towards Central London {{has resulted in the}} A23 carrying the majority of traffic through South London to the motorway. This is largely a single carriageway route, with many level junctions, traffic lights <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> interchanges. It travels largely through residential areas and is inadequte for the level of traffic it carries.|$|E
25|$|The series largely {{concerns}} the surreal <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> adventures of Tim and Daisy as they navigate through life, decide {{on what they}} want to do with their lives, come to terms with affairs of the heart, and try to figure out new and largely unproductive ways of killing time. Tim and Daisy repeatedly stress that they are not a couple to everyone but Marsha, but despite (or because of) this, romantic tension develops between them, particularly during the second series.|$|E
25|$|Isabella Swan - Isabella, {{who prefers}} {{to be called}} Bella, is a 17-year-old girl. She moves from Phoenix, Arizona to Forks, Washington {{to live with her}} father. Her mother moves to Florida with her second husband. Bella has a kind <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> {{personality}} that is more mature than most girls her age. She is intelligent and observant, noticing and formulating theories about the Cullens' strange behaviors, physical features, and unusual abilities. As the novel progresses, Bella unconsciously learns how to make difficult choices and accept their consequences.|$|E

25|$|Dead weights are the {{simplest}} type of anchor. They are generally {{made as a}} large concrete block with a rode attached which resists movement with sheer weight; and, to a small degree, by settling into the substrate. In New Zealand old railway wheels are sometimes used. The advantages are that they are simple and cheap. A dead weight mooring that drags in a storm still holds well in its new position. Such moorings are better suited to rocky bottoms where other mooring systems do not hold well. The disadvantages are that they are heavy, bulky, <b>and</b> <b>awkward.</b>|$|E
25|$|At Rangers, Andersen {{would play}} {{alongside}} fellow Dane Brian Laudrup. During {{his time at}} Rangers, Andersen's technical shortcomings <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> playing style earned him the nickname Bambi. Perhaps his most infamous moment at Rangers was when he shot the ball over the bar from four yards in a Premier League match against Dundee United. His best Rangers moment was when he came on as a substitute and scored twice in the 3–1 victory over arch-rivals Celtic at Ibrox Stadium. It was the goals to make it 2–1 and 3–1, which he delivered. Rangers won the Premier Division titles in both 1995/96 and 1996/97, {{but he could not}} establish himself in the Rangers starting line-up, and was eventually not allowed to train with the first team.|$|E
25|$|Hanel did {{not stay}} {{long in the}} group, {{and by the time}} of their {{recording}} debut she had been replaced by Bob Pezzola. This lineup of the group also featured saxophonist Daniel Galli-Duani, who had previously played with Kane as the avant-garde duo Transmission. The debut EP, Swans, released on Labor, is markedly different from anything they would do later. The plodding tempos and distorted, detuned guitar work is reminiscent of such post-punk outfits as Joy Division. However, the minimal chord structures owe more to blues, while the jazz instrumentation <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> time signatures are evidence of Swans' roots in the no wave scene of the late 1970s, which had more or less collapsed by the release of 1984's Cop.|$|E

50|$|Put {{into service}} on the Prague-Košice route, the type was not a success. The {{passenger}} cabin was very noisy, since it was placed immediately behind the engine. Furthermore, this placement made boarding <b>and</b> disembarking <b>awkward,</b> <b>and</b> visibility for the passengers was poor. Besides this, the Š-19 could not match the performance offered by foreign aircraft, and no further production was undertaken.|$|R

25|$|Many of Caragiale's {{writings}} reproduce {{discussions between}} clerks on their time off, which usually take {{the shape of}} generic <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> forays into culture or politics. Several {{of the characters in}} his sketches spuriously claim to be personal friends of major political figures of the day, or to have access to the back-rooms of politics and journalism. Although often alarmed by political or social developments, they tend to accommodate them quickly, and often encourage each other during very long stays at the beer garden. Gravitating in this environment are the petty journalists, who boast access to unlikely scoops, such as Bulgaria having decided to invade Romania. In one instance, Caragiale invents Caracudi, a newspaperman who writes his sensationalist articles while relaxing in the park.|$|E
25|$|If in {{fact there}} was no third road wheel, the chariot might have functioned as a compass if turns were always made so {{that one of the}} two wheels was {{stationary}} and only the other rotated, with the pointing doll connected to it by gears. The charioteer could have kept the stationary wheel from turning by controlling the horses appropriately. (A brake would have helped, but {{there is no mention of}} one in the description.) The radius of the curve around which the rotating wheel moved would have equalled the track-width of the chariot, and the gears turning the doll would have been chosen accordingly. This design would have worked as a compass for short journeys, but would have suffered from cumulative errors if used for long ones. Also, the chariot would have been slow <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> to turn. This might not have mattered if turns were rarely executed.|$|E
25|$|A {{remake of}} Sakura Wars for the PlayStation 2, titled Sakura Wars: In Hot Blood, was {{announced}} in 2002 {{as part of the}} Sakura Wars World Project. Developed by Sega studio Overworks, the remake was directed by Teruyu Terada, who had been battle planner for later Sakura Wars titles. The remake originated as part of Sega's efforts to reintroduce the wider world to the Sakura Wars series. As the versions of Sakura Wars prior to this point seemed old <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> when compared to its sequels up to that point, it was decided to remake Sakura Wars. New CGI segments were created, and the anime sequences redone by studio Production I.G. The subtitle was taken from a Tanka featured in Midaregami, a collection of tanka by famous Japanese writer and poet Akiko Yosano. Hiroi enjoyed her work, so featured quotes from her poems as subtitles for Sakura Wars titles several times following the first game's release.|$|E
