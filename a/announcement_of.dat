40|$|This thesis investigates <b>announcements</b> <b>of</b> {{sustainability}} news {{in major}} commercial Scandinavian banks and {{their effect on}} stock market performance by conducting a quantitative research method using a standard event study methodology. Two research questions are employed {{with the aim of}} firstly investigating if there is any relationship and secondly if the relationship differs between <b>announcements</b> <b>of</b> good news and bad news regarding sustainability. By analyzing events between 2007 to 2016, no statistically significant evidence for a relationship between <b>announcements</b> <b>of</b> sustainability news and stock market performance is found. This thesis finds statistically significant evidence that investors seem to respond positively to <b>announcements</b> <b>of</b> good sustainability news and no evidence for <b>announcements</b> <b>of</b> bad sustainability news. Hence, major commercial Scandinavian banks should focus on communicating those sustainability activities that {{have a positive effect on}} sustainability to their shareholders and other stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} valuation {{effects on}} the stocks of fifteen participating money-center banks <b>of</b> 774 <b>announcements</b> <b>of</b> syndicated loans, representing <b>announcements</b> <b>of</b> investment decisions for the lenders. The authors find that <b>announcements</b> <b>of</b> LDC loans in the 1970 s, especially those to Latin American borrowers, are associated with negative abnormal returns to the lending banks while <b>announcements</b> <b>of</b> loans to U. S. corporate borrowers in the 1980 s, especially those for takover finance, are associated with positive abnormal returns. While a number of testable predictions {{are consistent with the}} negative abnormal returns for Latin American loans, they explain response to takeover loans with a return-to-liquidity hypothesis.
