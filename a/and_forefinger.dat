5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb <b>and</b> <b>forefinger,</b> with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, Gleason was {{initially}} exempt from military service, {{since he was}} a father of two. However, in 1943 the US started drafting men with children. Gleason reported to his induction where the doctors discovered that his broken left arm had healed crooked, the area between his thumb <b>and</b> <b>forefinger</b> was nerveless and numb, a pilonidal cyst existed {{at the end of his}} coccyx, and that he was 100 pounds overweight. Gleason was therefore classified 4-F, and rejected for military service.|$|E

60|$|Jeff relaxed {{the muscles}} of his wrists, so as to throw the thumb <b>and</b> <b>forefingers</b> a trifle forward. This simple action {{relieved}} Blue Grass, alias Miss Mayfield, and made the coach steadier and less jerky. Wonderful co-relation of forces.|$|R
25|$|Entwistle's playing {{technique}} incorporated fingerstyle, plectrum, tapping, {{and the use}} of harmonics. He {{changed his}} style between songs and even during songs to alter the sound he produced. His fingering technique involved plucking strings very forcefully to produce a trebly, twangy sound. He changed his thumb position from pick-up to the E string and occasionally even positioning his thumb near the pick-up. His plectrum technique involved holding the plectrum between his thumb <b>and</b> <b>forefinger,</b> {{with the rest of his}} fingers outstretched for balance.|$|E
25|$|Early model diving masks had {{a single}} {{elliptical}} pane of glass. These masks have indentations in the skirt at the bottom {{on either side of}} the nose, into which the diver can insert a thumb <b>and</b> <b>forefinger</b> to pinch the nose, when performing a Valsalva maneuver to clear their ears. This design was improved by bringing the window closer to the face, reducing the volume of air inside the mask, thus making mask clearing easier. The window has a cutout to fit around the nose, which is covered by the rubber or silicone material of the skirt. This facilitates pinching the nose when ear-clearing.|$|E
25|$|A sling {{has a small}} cradle or pouch in {{the middle}} of two lengths of cord. The sling stone is placed in the pouch. The middle finger or thumb is placed through a loop on the end of one cord, and a tab {{at the end of the}} other cord is placed between the thumb <b>and</b> <b>forefinger.</b> The sling is swung in an arc, and the tab {{released}} at a precise moment. This frees the projectile to fly to the target. The sling essentially works by extending the length of a human arm, thus allowing stones to be thrown much farther than they could be by hand.|$|E
5000|$|A simple opener is a {{piece of}} metal with a {{rectangular}} or rounded opening in one end and a solid handle large enough to be gripped between the thumb <b>and</b> <b>forefingers</b> on the other. The opening contains a lip that is placed under the edge of the bottle top, pulling it off when upward force is applied to the handle end of the opener. This type of opener is small and durable, so it is frequently used as a key fob.|$|R
5000|$|On 13 March 1996, {{less than}} two years after he had retired, Kieślowski died at age 54 during open-heart surgery {{following}} a heart attack. He was interred in Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw. His grave has a sculpture of the thumb <b>and</b> <b>forefingers</b> of two hands forming an oblong space—the classic view as if through a movie camera. The small sculpture is in black marble on a pedestal slightly over a metre tall. The slab with Kieślowski's name and dates lies below.|$|R

25|$|During the American Revolutionary War, {{a policy}} {{similar to the}} Navy's Press Gangs was introduced. Two acts were passed, the Recruiting Act 1778 and the Recruiting Act 1779, for the impressment of individuals. For some men {{this would have been}} for being drunk and disorderly. The chief {{advantages}} of these acts was in the number of volunteers brought in under the apprehension of impressment. To avoid impressment, some recruits incapacitated themselves by cutting off the thumb <b>and</b> <b>forefinger</b> of the right hand. Both acts were repealed in 1780. The British Government also released criminals and debtors from prison on the condition they joined the army. Three entire regiments during the American Revolution were raised from this early release programme. Of the Volunteer recruits, some would find they had been enticed to take the King's shilling under false pretenses and many men would find they had signed to a lifetime in the army.|$|E
25|$|In costume, the Ghostfaces share a ritualistic mannerism of {{gripping}} {{the blade of}} their knife between thumb <b>and</b> <b>forefinger</b> and wiping it clean of any blood following a murder by drawing their hand from handle {{to the tip of}} the knife. This characteristic was given to the character by stuntman Dane Farwell who wore the costume for many of its scenes in Scream. Each killer is depicted as possessing effective physical abilities, such as the capabilities of nearly flawless stealth, prowling without being detected, moving silently, and efficiently vanishing from their targets' defense. Additionally, the killer tends to display sufficient strength that allows them to overpower victims, such as in Scream 2, in regards to defeating two trained detectives single-handedly. Ghostface is shown to be able to sustain and even ignore severe levels of physical damage, surviving blunt trauma, stabbing wounds and gunshots. Billy, Mickey, Roman, and Jill all had to be shot through the head or multiple times to the chest to be killed, despite having sustained severe injuries prior.|$|E
25|$|The flipper is bowled on the {{opposite}} side to a slider, much {{in the same way that}} the top-spinner is bowled. On release, the bowler 'pinches' or clicks the thumb <b>and</b> <b>forefinger,</b> causing the ball to come out underneath the hand. There must be sufficient tension in the wrist and fingers to impart a good helping of backspin or underspin. In doing so the flipper will float on towards the batsman and land on a fuller length than he anticipated, often leaving him caught on the back foot when he wrongly assumes it to be a pullable or a cuttable ball. The back spin or underspin will cause the ball to hurry on at great pace with very little bounce, though this may be harder to achieve on softer wickets. A series of normal leg spinners or topspinners, with their dropping looping flight, will have the batsman used to the ball pitching on a shorter length. The batsman may wrongly assume that the flipper will drop and loop like a normal overspinning delivery, resulting in the ball pitching under the bat and going on to either hit the stumps or result in leg before wicket.|$|E
50|$|Seperewa can {{be played}} in {{different}} positions. The player can play while sitting down with the instrument resting on his lap, with {{the neck of the}} instrument standing upright. He may also play while standing, the instrument held firmly in the groin to gain enough support, the neck facing perpendicular in the same direction. Strumming and plucking are the two basic techniques applied and these are done by the thumbs <b>and</b> <b>forefingers</b> with some occasional assistance from the middle fingers. The Seprewa player can even dance while he is playing or make some dramatic movements.|$|R

2500|$|In American Sign Language a {{ligature}} of the American {{manual alphabet}} {{is used to}} sign [...] "I love you", from the English initialism ILY.

2500|$|Bull-holders, {{also known}} as bull-tongs, have a pliers action and are used for short periods on grown cattle when they are being mouthed or drenched. A chain, rope or strap keeps the grips closed and may be passed over a bar {{at the front of}} a head bail to elevate the head. [...] The thumb <b>and</b> <b>forefinger</b> may also used in this way on smaller animals.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} common ways to shoot in beer pong: the arc, the fastball (or [...] "laser, snipe, kamikaze"), and the bounce shot. The most common {{throwing}} technique is the arc shot, where one grasps the ping pong ball with {{the tips of}} the thumb <b>and</b> <b>forefinger,</b> holds the arm at an angle with the ball upwards, then throws using a gentle elbow motion holding the upper arm parallel with the table.|$|E

2500|$|Doak became {{credited}} for {{the modern}} design of the baseball glove after suggesting to Rawlings in 1919 that a web be laced between the thumb <b>and</b> <b>forefinger</b> to create a pocket [...] that extended the surface by which the fielder could catch the ball. [...] Also that year, the league moved to ban pitching with the spitball {{due in part to}} it giving the pitcher an unfair advantage over the hitter. [...] However, he helped lead an initiative to which the owners eventually agreed to a provision that allowed himself and 16 other spitballers to grandfather use of the pitch until the end of their careers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{plectrum}} banjo is {{a standard}} banjo without the short drone string. It usually has 22 frets on the neck and a scale length of 26 to 28inches, and was originally tuned C3 G3 B3 D4. It can also be tuned like the top four strings of a guitar, which is known as [...] "Chicago tuning." [...] As the name suggests, it is usually played with a guitar-style pick (that is, a single one held between thumb <b>and</b> <b>forefinger),</b> unlike the five-string banjo, which is either played with a thumbpick and two fingerpicks, or with bare fingers. The plectrum banjo evolved out of the five-string banjo, to cater to styles of music involving strummed chords. The plectrum is also featured in many early jazz recordings and arrangements.|$|E
