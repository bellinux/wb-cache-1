The Hungarian mortality rates were analysed by autoregressive integrated moving average models and seasonal time series models examined {{the data of}} <b>acute</b> childhood <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukaemia.</b> The mortality data may be analysed by time series methods such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling. This method is demonstrated by two examples: analysis of the mortality rates of ischemic heart diseases {{and analysis of the}} mortality rates of cancer of digestive system.

Calculations of confidence intervals for autoregressive parameters by tree methods: standard normal distribution as estimation and estimation of the White's theory and the continuous time case estimation.

40|$|Background: Mediator complex {{participates in}} {{transcriptional}} regulation by connecting regulatory DNA sequences to the RNA polymerase II initiation complex. Recently, we discovered through exome sequencing {{that as many}} as 70 % of uterine leiomyomas harbour specific mutations in exon 2 of mediator complex subunit 12 (MED 12). In this work, we examined the role of MED 12 exon 2 mutations in other tumour types. Methods: The frequency of MED 12 exon 2 mutations was analysed in altogether 1158 tumours by direct sequencing. The tumour spectrum included mesenchymal tumours (extrauterine leiomyomas, endometrial polyps, lipomas, uterine leiomyosarcomas, other sarcomas, gastro-intestinal stromal tumours), hormone-dependent tumours (breast and ovarian cancers), haematological malignancies (<b>acute</b> myeloid <b>leukaemias,</b> <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukaemias,</b> myeloproliferative neoplasms), and tumours associated with abnormal Wnt-signalling (colorectal cancers (CRC)). Results: Five somatic alterations were observed: three in uterine leiomyosarcomas (3 / 41, 7 %; Gly 44 Ser, Ala 38 _Leu 39 ins 7, Glu 35 _Leu 36 delinsVal), and two in CRC (2 / 392, 0. 5 %; Gly 44 Cys, Ala 67 Val). Conclusion: Somatic MED 12 exon 2 mutations were observed in uterine leiomyosarcomas, suggesting that a subgroup of these malignant tumours may develop from a leiomyoma precursor.

Methods: Five-year survival between countries was compared for all malignancies and for the major diagnostic categories, adjusting for age, and estimated average European survival weighting for differences in childhood populations. Results: For all cancers combined, survival variation was large (45 % in Estonia to 90 % in Iceland), and was generally low (60 - 70 %) in eastern Europe and high (≥ 75 %) in Switzerland, Germany and the Nordic countries (except Denmark). The Nordic countries had the highest survival for four of the seven major tumour types: nephroblastoma (92 %), <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukaemia</b> (85 %), CNS tumours (73 %) and acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (62 %). The eastern countries had lowest survival: 89 % for Hodgkin's disease, 71 % for nephroblastoma, 68 % for <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukaemia,</b> 61 % for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 57 % for central nervous system (CNS) tumours and 29 % for acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia. Conclusions: The Nordic countries represent a survival gold standard to which other countries can aspire. Since most childhood cancers respond well to treatment, survival differences are attributable to differences in access (including referral and timely diagnosis) and use of modern treatments; however, the obstacles to access and application of standard treatments probably vary markedly with country...|$|E

40|$|We used an {{in vitro}} clonogenic assay in {{semi-solid}} medium {{to test the}} sensitivity of normal bone marrow and <b>acute</b> myeloid and <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukaemia</b> progenitors to the flavonol quercetin. We have studied 14 acute myeloid (AML) and four <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoid</b> (ALL) <b>leukaemias.</b> All ALL {{and the vast majority}} of AML (12 / 14) had a high sensitivity to quercetin with more than 50 % growth inhibition at 2 x 10 - 6 M quercetin. One M 3 -AML was partially quercetin-sensitive displaying 60 % surviving AML-colony forming units (CFU-AML) at a quercetin concentration of 10 - 5 M. One M 1 -AML was resistant to the growth inhibitory effect of quercetin at a concentration of 2 x 10 - 5 M. The clonogenic efficiency of both AML and ALL positively correlated with leukaemic colony-forming unit (CFU-L) sensitivity to quercetin suggesting that this parameter can be useful in predicting quercetin responsiveness of leukaemic cells. We have also studied the effect of various quercetin concentrations on colony formation by normal bone marrow cells. At a quercetin concentration of 10 - 5 M, we observed (in five different experiments) a mean recovery of 53 % and 65 % of erythroid blast-forming units (BFU-E) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM), respectively. Thus, normal bone marrow appeared partially resistant to quercetin, being inhibited less than 50 % by quercetin concentration higher than 2 x 10 - 5. When normal bone marrow were deprived in CD 34 + haematopoietic progenitors the resultant population became highly sensitive to quercetin, with a mean recovery of BFU-E and CFU-GM of 5 % and 12 % of controls respectively in the presence of 2 x 10 - 5 M quercetin. Furthermore, CD 34 progenitors, positively selected, appeared fully resistant to quercetin concentrations as high as 2 x 10 - 5 M. Thus, CD 34 + progenitors are a quercetin-resistant component in normal bone marrow. In conclusion, our results further provide a biological basis for the therapeutic use of quercetin, considering that this compound could inhibit leukaemic cell growth without suppressing normal haematopoiesis...|$|R

The renewing cells have a long in vitro lifespan exceeding the Hayflick limit of avian cells. Analysis of clonal cultures identified the renewing cells as immature, multipotent progenitors, expressing erythroid, myeloid, lymphoid and stem cell surface markers. Employing a two-step commitment/differentiation protocol involving the controlled withdrawal of SCF, the MLL-ENL-transformed progenitors could be induced to terminal erythroid or myeloid differentiation.

Immunol. 153, 214 - 226]. Here, by means of dot-blot hybridization and RNase protection assay, evidence is provided that human peripheral T-cells as well as derived cell lines contain significant amounts of APN mRNA, comparable to that in the promyeloic cell line U 937, and that mitogenic activation of peripheral human T-cells leads to a more than 4 -fold increase in their APN mRNA content. In the course of activation, T-cells increase their total alanine p-nitroanilide-hydrolysing activity to approx. 7 -fold that of resting cells. Furthermore these cells become immunoreactive towards CD 13 to a significant extent (up to 51 %) as shown by surface staining and confirmed by activity staining and immunostaining after isoelectric focusing (pI of T-cell APN = 4. 6). In addition it is demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy that viable, activated T-cells effectively cleave the fluorogenic aminopeptidase substrate bis-glycyl-rhodamine 110 and that the corresponding aminopeptidase activity is associated with the cell surface. We show that specific inhibitors of APN, probestin and actinonin, strongly decrease DNA synthesis in phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) -stimulated T-cells. In summary, evidence is presented that in the course of mitogenic activation human peripheral T-cells increase the expression of APN both at the transcriptional level and at the cell surface.

For females, survival was significantly improved for ALL 97 / 99 (HR = 0 · 33; 95 %CI 0 · 14 – 0 · 78), and non-significantly improved for UKALL 2003 (HR = 0 · 51; 95 %CI 0 · 25 – 1 · 08) compared to UKALLXI. Modest overall survival improvements masked clinically important gender-specific changes over time by trial era, requiring confirmation in larger population-based studies...|$|E
40|$|In November 1984 {{an expert}} {{committee}} was convened {{at the invitation}} of the Department of Health to advise on action which might be taken in response to professional and public concern about possible health consequences, in particular cancer risk, from previous and current levels of ionising radiation in the Irish Sea region. The committee advised that, since a national cancer registry is not available, a special study to establish cancer incidence should be undertaken in the first instance. It was agreed that, since the induction period of <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukaemia</b> (ALL) in children is relatively short, the mortality and incidence of this tumour should first be studied; consideration of aetiological factors {{was not included in the}} terms of reference of this study since such research would have taken considerably longer to complete. Other lymphoid malignancies were also included in the study but subsequently it was found that the numbers available were too small for reliable analysis; therefore this report concentrates on the findings in relation to ALL...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{survival in}} 40, 392 children (age 0 - 14 years) and 30, 187 adolescents/young adults (age 15 - 24 years) {{diagnosed with cancer}} between 1995 and 2002. The cases were from 83 European population-based cancer registries in 23 countries participating in EUROCARE- 4. Five-year survival in countries and in regional groupings of countries was compared for all cancers combined and for major cancers. Survival for 15 rare cancers in children was also analysed. Five-year survival for all cancers combined was 81 % in children and 87 % in adolescents/young adults. Between-country survival differences narrowed for both children and adolescents/young adults. Relative risk of death reduced significantly, by 8 % in children and by 13 % in adolescents/young adults, from 1995 - 1999 to 2000 - 2002. Survival improved significantly over time for <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukaemia</b> and primitive neuroectodermal tumours in children and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adolescents/young adults.

40|$|Here {{we report}} that the slow-transforming helper {{component}} of Friend murine leukaemia virus (Fr-MLV), which produces <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukaemias</b> in normal mice, induces erythroleukaemia in mice given syngeneic pituitary grafts (SPG). Newborn mice were infected with Fr-MLV and, at one month of age, were transplanted with two pituitary glands under the kidney capsule. Sham-operated infected mice and uninfected transplanted mice served as controls. SPG selectively reduced the mean survival times of infected mice. Histopathology showed that, while most infected non-transplanted mice developed <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukaemias,</b> virtually all Fr-MLF-infected mice given SPG developed erythroleukaemias. Experiments in vitro showed that Fr-MLV infection markedly depressed concanavalin A induced DNA synthesis in cells from spleen, thymus and lymph nodes. Addition of prolactin or growth hormone further suppressed lectin-induced mitogenesis of lymphoid cells from infected mice, but failed to influence the response of uninfected controls. These experiments indicate that, in mice, pituitary hormones modulate the development and the histological features of Fr-MLV induced leukaemias, and suggest that endocrine-immunological interactions {{play a role in}} retrovirus induced tumorigenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the clinical features, prognostic factors, and efficacy of treatments in patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm with a leukemic presentation at onset of the disease. In order to do this, a retrospective multicenter study was performed from 2005 - 2011 in 28 Italian hematology divisions in which 43 cases were collected. Forty-one patients received an induction therapy, consisting of an acute myeloid leukemia-type regimen in 26 patients (60 %) and <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoid</b> leukemia/lymphoma-type regimen in 15 patients (35 %). Six patients (14 %) underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Seventeen patients (41 %) achieved a complete remission: seven after acute myeloid leukemia-type treatment and 10 after an <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoid</b> leukemia/lymphoma-type regimen, with a significant advantage for <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoid</b> leukemia/lymphoma-type chemotherapy (P= 0. 02). Relapse occurred in six of the 17 patients (35 %) who achieved complete remission, more frequently after <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoid</b> leukemia/lymphoma-type chemotherapy. The median overall survival was 8. 7 months (range, 0. 2 - 32. 9). The patients treated with an acute myeloid leukemia-type regimen had an overall survival of 7. 1 months (range, 0. 2 - 19. 5), whereas that of the patients receiving <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoid</b> leukemia/lymphoma-type chemotherapy was 12. 3 months (range, 1 - 32. 9) (P= 0. 02). The median overall survival of the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients was 22. 7 months (range, 12 - 32. 9), and these patients had a significant survival advantage compared to the non-transplanted patients (median 7. 1 months, 0. 2 - 21. 3; P= 0. 03). In conclusion, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm with bone-marrow involvement is an aggressive subtype of high-risk acute leukemia. The rarity of this disease does not enable prospective clinical trials to identify the better therapeutic strategy, which, at present, is based on clinicians' experience...|$|R
40|$|Necrosis of {{the bone}} marrow is rarely {{observed}} during life. Less than 50 cases have been reported, {{for the most part}} in patients with leukemia. The finding of bone marrow necrosis in children is even more rare. Of the seven cases reported, six patients had <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoid</b> leukemia and one patient had lymphocytic lymphoma. The occurrence of marrow necrosis diagnosed by aspirate and by biopsy in a child 18 months of age is presented. The necrosis was present several months before the appearance of <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoid</b> leukemia. The reasons for the presumed rarity of this pathological finding, its relationship with bone or joint pain and fever, hypotheses concerning pathogenesis, and its prognostic value are discussed...|$|R
