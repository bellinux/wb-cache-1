40|$|Our {{conceptual}} {{paradigm of}} work <b>and</b> <b>family</b> has shifted {{in the past}} decade from one that viewed managing work <b>and</b> <b>family</b> as a challenge to a contemporary view that we are facing a ‘collision’ (Pocock, 2003) between work <b>and</b> <b>family.</b> This review of work <b>and</b> <b>family</b> research begins to explore the shifting conceptualisations, outlining demographic developments before examining key research themes of work <b>and</b> <b>family</b> balance, work <b>and</b> <b>family</b> conflict, <b>and</b> flexibility as a potential means of achieving work <b>and</b> <b>family</b> balance. Changing work patterns in Australia, such as casualisation, working longer hours and non-standard hours, are investigated as potential contributors to a work <b>and</b> <b>family</b> collision <b>and</b> the pattern to downshifting explored as one strategy adopted by families to attain the best fit between work <b>and</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> avoid a collision. 10 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{conceptual}} framework for the intersection of work <b>and</b> <b>family</b> roles based on the constructs of work involvement <b>and</b> <b>family</b> involvement. The theoretical and empirical literature on the intersection of work <b>and</b> <b>family</b> roles is reviewed from two analytical approaches. From the individual level of analysis, the literature reviewed reveals three theoretical models which assert: (1) that work <b>and</b> <b>family</b> are separate role environments (segmented); (2) that work <b>and</b> <b>family</b> roles are antithetical (compensatory); or (3) that work <b>and</b> <b>family</b> roles are fundamentally similar (spillover). Literature from the couple's level of analysis is then reviewed which presents evidence {{for the existence of}} an inter-spouse relationship. Based on this review, {{a conceptual framework}} is proposed. Included is a table which lists all possible combinations of work <b>and</b> <b>family</b> involvement between two spouses...|$|R
