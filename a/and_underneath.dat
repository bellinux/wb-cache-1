5|$|Leotia lubrica favours damp {{deciduous}} woodland, but {{can also}} be found under conifers. Particular favoured habitats include path sides <b>and</b> <b>underneath</b> bracken, while favoured substrates include soil, moss and plant waste, where it feeds as a saprotroph. Fruit bodies are typically encountered from late summer to late autumn in Europe, and from late spring to autumn in North America, where it is the most common Leotia species. It has also been recorded in eastern Asia, in China and Tibet, as well as in New Zealand and Australia.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{elaborate}} carved stone battle-axes found in East Lothian, Aberdenshire and Lanarkshire. These show little sign of use or wear, and so, {{rather than being}} practical objects, may be symbolic representations of power. Similarly, the site at Forteviot, in Perthshire, produced a unique warrior burial under a giant sandstone slab. The slab is engraved with a spiral and has an axehead pecked into the underside, <b>and</b> <b>underneath</b> there are grave goods of a copper dagger with leather scabbard and a carved wooden bowl.|$|E
5|$|While Eddie goes in pursuit, Peter {{manages to}} slip out and goes after Connors as Spider-Man. While trying to {{communicate}} with him, they end up on a subway train fighting both inside, outside, <b>and</b> <b>underneath</b> it. Finally, Spider-Man falls off the train and Connors escapes. Spider-Man returns to the lab and is given a gene cleanser from Martha which must be administered to Connors orally. He then goes off to Bronx Zoo, where Connors is reportedly at.|$|E

5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony was}} held by New York City Mayor John Hylan on April 14, 1923 in Bay Ridge and in Staten Island on July 19. Headings were dug and tunneling shafts were sunk at 68th Street and Shore Road in Brooklyn (the Shore Road Shaft), <b>and</b> <b>underneath</b> the Saint George Terminal in Staten Island (the South Street Shaft), costing a total of $1 million. In addition, {{in preparation for the}} tunnel, the SIRT purchased one hundred ME-1 subway cars built to BMT specifications and electrified its three-passenger branches. The impending completion of the tunnel also sparked real estate interests in Staten Island.|$|E
5|$|Early on 27 February, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{classified}} {{the system}} as a tropical depression. During the day, a QuikSCAT pass revealed a broad low-level circulation with the highest winds located around the periphery of the storm, a characteristic of monsoonal systems. Although it was situated within a region of low wind shear <b>and</b> <b>underneath</b> an anticyclone, convective activity was mostly present in the system's large outer bands. Later that day, the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded the system to a Category 1 cyclone on the Australian intensity scale and named it Emma. At this time, Emma was located roughly 305km (190mi) north of Onslow, Western Australia. Several hours later, the JTWC classified Emma as Tropical Storm 15S following the development of convection near the centre of circulation.|$|E
5|$|The Cunningham–Rawnsley team {{used the}} AI {{specifically}} to position themselves directly astern <b>and</b> <b>underneath</b> the enemy. Although the German bombers carried a dorsal gunner, {{it was difficult}} to locate an enemy against the black colour of the landscape. Usually the blackness of the country would swallow up the outline of an approaching night fighter. As they approached, the slipstream of the enemy could prove hazardous; bucking the Beaufighter and throwing the pilot off his aim. Approaching from slightly below allowed the attacking pilot to avoid the slipstream. The tactics allowed for Cunningham to close the range and fire first, which was usually sufficient to end the engagement quickly and successfully. Bob Braham, a rival night fighter ace, also used this tactic.|$|E

5|$|The {{skin of a}} larva is mottled with black, brown, {{and yellow}} pigmentation. Skin color changes as the larvae develop and pigment cells migrate and {{concentrate}} in {{different regions of the}} body. The pigment cells, called chromatophores, are derived from the neural crest. The three types of pigment chromatophores in salamanders include yellow xanthophores, black melanophores, and silvery iridiophores (or guanophores). As the larvae mature, the melanophores concentrate along the body and provide the darker background. The yellow xanthophores arrange along the spine and on top of the limbs. The rest of the body is flecked with reflective iridiophores along the sides <b>and</b> <b>underneath.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{flurry of}} action followed. On 1 July 1941 he {{expended}} 89 rounds and damaged a Bf 109E. Bader's section was attacked and Johnson out-turned his assailant. Firing, he saw glycol streaming behind it. On 14 July, the Tangmere Wing flew on Circus 48 to St Omer. Losing {{sight of the}} squadron, Johnson and his wingman proceeded inland at 3,000 feet after spotting three aircraft. Turning in behind them, he identified them as Bf 109Fs. Johnson dived so as to come up <b>and</b> <b>underneath</b> into the enemy's blind spot. Closing to 15 yards, he gave the trailing Bf 109 a two-second burst. The tail was blown off and his windshield was covered in oil from the Messerschmitt. Johnson saw the other Bf 109s spinning down out of control. Having also lost his wingman, Johnson disengaged. Climbing and crossing the coast at Etaples, Johnson bounced a Bf 109E. Giving chase in a dive to 2,000 feet and firing at 150 yards, he observed something flying off the Bf 109's starboard wing. Johnson could not see any more owing to the oil-covered windscreen and {{did not make a}} claim. His second victory was probably Unteroffizier (Corporal) R. Klienike, III./Jagdgeschwader 26 (Third Group, Fighter Wing 26) who was posted missing.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} eastern Pacific hurricanes between 1988 and 1990 that began as {{tropical}} waves off the western coast of Africa, Hurricane Kiko developed {{out of a}} large-scale mesoscale convective system on August23 {{on the coast of}} Sonora. The system slowly tracked southward into the Gulf of California and became increasingly organized. Shower and thunderstorm activity was present around an area of low pressure the following day; however, insufficient reports from the region hindered the National Hurricane Center's (NHC) forecasting ability. By August25, satellite intensity estimates, using the Dvorak technique, indicated that the low had developed into a tropical depression around 1200UTC, while the storm was located about 115miles (185kilometers) south of Mazatlán, Sinaloa. Operationally, the system was not declared a tropical depression; instead it was immediately declared Tropical Storm Kiko with winds of 40mph (65km/h). Located within an area with little or no steering current, and situated over warm waters <b>and</b> <b>underneath</b> an upper-level low, conditions were near perfect for rapid intensification, despite the proximity to land. A general northwestward drift was anticipated, and the NHC forecast the storm to reach hurricane intensity within 24hours.|$|E

At the mikvah itself, a female attendant is present to make certain that the woman immerses herself fully, including her hairs. Though that is the attendant's foremost duty, she may also help by checking a woman's back or answer questions regarding proper ritual protocol.|$|E
25|$|On 23 and 30 June 2015, {{striking}} workers associated with MyFerryLink damaged {{the sections of}} track by burning car tires, leading to all trains being cancelled and a backlog of vehicles. Hundreds seeking to reach Britain made use of the situation to attempt to stowaway inside <b>and</b> <b>underneath</b> transport trucks destined for the United Kingdom. Extra security measures including: £2-million upgrade of detection technology; £1 million extra for dog searches; £12 million (over three years) towards a joint fund with France for security surrounding the Port of Calais.|$|E
25|$|Pathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's {{forensic}} science institute, performed the autopsy on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of sixteen bruises and seven cuts. These included several bruises {{and a couple}} of insubstantial cuts on the palm of her hand. Bruises on her nose, nostrils, mouth, <b>and</b> <b>underneath</b> her jaw were compatible with a hand being clamped over her mouth and nose. Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's {{forensic science}} institute who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.|$|E

25|$|Therefore in June 1945, 311 Squadron was {{transferred}} to RAF Transport Command and started flying GR.VI Liberators that had been converted into military transport aircraft. In each aircraft a temporary wooden floor covered the bomb bay doors. A cargo and passenger doorway was inserted in {{one side of the}} fuselage. If passengers were to be carried, wooden benches were installed. The colours of the aircraft remained as they had been under Coastal Command: white on the sides <b>and</b> <b>underneath,</b> with camouflage only on the upper surfaces. In August 1945, 311 Squadron {{was transferred}} from RAF Manston in Kent, England to Ruzyně Airport, Prague, Czechoslovakia to continue transport operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{album cover}} is an {{illustration}} (in pencil) by artist Nick Price, {{who had also}} designed the cover for the programme for her 1979 tour. Bush {{was pleased with the}} results (it depicts a multitude of animals and monsters emerging from under her skirt). Of the concept, Bush said that it reflects the title, depicting good and bad things that emerge from you. The album was released on compact disc in Japan in 1987 with the cover art modified. A section of the original cover art was enlarged, creating two different booklet covers: the outer one modified; <b>and</b> <b>underneath</b> the original. The album's cover was voted 'Greatest Album Cover of 1980' by Record Mirror.|$|E
25|$|Smaller {{blood vessels}} of the retina are {{abnormally}} developed and appear tortuous and dilated to a variable extent, typically in one sector and {{mainly in the}} peripheral and temporal portions of the retina. This is known as telangiectasia. The vessel walls are weak and leak blood plasma and lipid within <b>and</b> <b>underneath</b> the retina. This leakage can lead to exudative retinal detachment, also known as exudative retinopathy in this context. The detachment typically has a yellowish tint because the fluid under the retina contains lipid. These findings mimic Coats disease. Characteristically, the abnormal vessels are localized and the retinal blood vessels peripheral to the abnormal ones seemingly have failed to develop and are thus not seen.|$|E

25|$|All Home Office {{police forces}} {{have access to}} air support, often {{in the form of}} helicopters. Some forces also have small fixed wing aircraft. Police Helicopters are {{required}} by the CAA to be marked in a standard 'high conspicuosity' paint scheme, to make them more visible and avoid the possibility of air proximity hazards with other low flying aircraft. This paint scheme, also used by UK military training helicopters, requires them to be black on the sides <b>and</b> <b>underneath,</b> and yellow on top. When seen from the ground, these helicopters are black but this is to make them more visible against the sky as a safety feature (and yellow against the ground when seen from above). One of the most common helicopters used by the police is the Eurocopter EC135.|$|E
25|$|Directly {{behind the}} cockpit <b>and</b> <b>underneath</b> the main rotor was the rotorcraft's engine and its nylon bag-type fuel tank, which was housed within a welded tubular steel {{framework}} {{attached to the}} cockpit structure and to the tailboom. Power was directed to the tail rotor via a torque shaft contained within the tail cone, which featured gearing so that pilots could readily adjust the speed and direction of tail rotor movement. The engine was provided with cooling air via an intake on {{the centre of the}} starboard side of the rotorcraft; for improved ventilation, the cowling around the engine area could be entirely removed. The de Havilland Gipsy Major that was used to power the majority of Skeeters was credited with being a major contributor to the rotorcraft's relatively high fuel efficiency due to its use of fuel injectors (the high aerodynamic efficiency of the airframe itself was another beneficial factor).|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to {{complement}} the Fairtrade product certification system and allow most notably handcraft producers to also sell their products outside worldshops, the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) launched in 2004 a new Mark to identify fair trade organizations (as opposed to products {{in the case of}} FLO International and Fairtrade). Called the FTO Mark, it allows consumers to recognize registered Fair Trade Organizations worldwide and seeks to guarantee that standards are being implemented regarding working conditions, wages, child labour, and the environment. The FTO Mark offers Fair Trade Organizations (including handcrafts producers) definable standards which inform consumers, business partners, governments, and donors of the applicable trading standard. in 2014 the Fairtrade Program Mark was introduced to create new sales opportunities, initially for cocoa, sugar and cotton producers. It has the same round logo alongside the word FAIRTRADE in black <b>and</b> <b>underneath</b> the program title in turquoise.|$|E
