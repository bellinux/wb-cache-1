500|$|The CCAF has distanced {{itself from}} other firms, {{sometimes}} called [...] "professional objectors", that {{make money by}} holding up class action settlements until they themselves are paid off, [...] Whereas that practice has been criticized as doing to class action lawyers what class action lawyers <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> companies, one commentator said that CCAF appears to be doing so {{as a matter of}} principle. According to The American Lawyer, as of March 2011, the CCAF had filed objections to 17 settlements, with eight objections pending in federal district courts, and had been successful on six of them.|$|E
500|$|Feelings: {{emotions}} or sensations, free {{of thought}} and story. These are to be distinguished from thoughts (e.g., [...] "I feel I didn't get a fair deal") and from words colloquially used as feelings but which convey what {{we think we are}} (e.g., [...] "inadequate"), how we think others are evaluating us (e.g., [...] "unimportant"), or what we think others <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> us (e.g., [...] "misunderstood", [...] "ignored"). Feelings are said to reflect whether we are experiencing our needs as met or unmet. Identifying feelings is said to allow us to more easily connect with one another, and [...] "Allowing ourselves to be vulnerable by expressing our feelings can help resolve conflicts." ...|$|E

She asks which {{students}} are planning to participate; most raise their hands, but two children shrug apathetically. The teacher reassures them that this is [...] "fine, it's absolutely fine, it's your choice" [...] and there is [...] "no pressure", but then shifts the papers on her desk to reveal a red-buttoned detonator, which she presses. The two children {{who did not want}} to participate explode, covering their screaming classmates with blood and body parts. The blood-spattered teacher then goes on casually to explain the night's homework to her horrified charges.|$|E
500|$|The {{book is a}} travelogue and {{biological}} record, but also reveals the two men's philosophies: it dwells on the place of humans in the environment, the interconnection between single organisms and the larger ecosystem, and the themes of leaving and returning home. A number of ecological concerns, rare in 1940, are voiced, such as an imagined but horrific vision of the long term damage that the Japanese bottom fishing trawlers <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> the sea bed. Although written {{as if it were}} the journal kept by Steinbeck during the voyage, the book is to some extent a work of fiction: the journals are not Steinbeck's, and his wife, who had accompanied him on the trip, is not mentioned (though at one point Steinbeck slips and mentions the matter of food for seven people). Since returning home is a theme throughout the narrative, the inclusion of his wife, a symbol of home, would have dissipated the effect. Steinbeck and Ricketts are never mentioned by name but are amalgamated into the first person [...] "we" [...] who narrate the log.|$|E

Dr. Bert Pfeiffer of the University of Montana presented the first public testimony about the potential toxicity and health effects of the chemical Agent Orange. A special panel of psychiatrists was convened, {{many of whom had}} served in Vietnam, to discuss the impact of the war on American society. Midway through the hearings, the organizers insisted that no one make statements on behalf of the Vietnam veterans except for vets. It was presumed by reporters that this was to separate the participation of veterans from that of people like Mark Lane.|$|E

2500|$|A theory {{based in}} self-efficacy, Self Regulation is [...] "A theory of {{motivation}} {{based on the}} setting of goals and the receipt of accurate feedback that is monitored to enhance the likelihood of goal attainment" [...] It is presumed that people consciously set goals for themselves that guide and direct their behavior toward the attainment of these goals. These people also engage in self-monitoring or self-evaluation. Self-evaluation can be helped along if feedback is given {{when a person is}} working on their goals because it can align how a person feels about how they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> achieve a goal and what they are actually doing to achieve their goals. In short, feedback provides an [...] "error" [...] message that a person who is off-track can reevaluate their goal.|$|E

60|$|How {{many there}} are who love gossip and scandal; who {{always talk about}} people, and never about things--certainly not about things pure and lovely and of good report, but rather about things foul and ugly and of bad report; who do not talk, {{because they do not}} think of virtue, but of vice; or of praise either, because they are always finding fault with their neighbours. The man who loves a foul story, or a coarse jest--the woman who gossips over every tittle tattle of scandal which she can pick up against her neighbour--what do these people do but defile their own souls afresh, after they have been washed clean in the blood of Christ? Foul their souls are, and {{therefore}} their thoughts are foul likewise, and the foulness of them is evident to all men by their tongues. Out of their hearts proceed evil thoughts about their neighbours, out of the abundance of their hearts their mouths speak them. Now let such people, if there be any such here, seriously consider the harm which they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> their own characters. They may give way to the habits of scandal, or of coarse talk, without any serious bad intention; but they will surely lower their own souls thereby. They will grow to the colour of what they feed on and become foul and cruel, from talking cruelly and foully, till they lose all purity and all charity, all faith and trust in their fellow-men, all power of seeing good in any one, or doing anything but think evil; and so lose the likeness of God and of Christ, for the likeness of some foul carrion bird, which cares nothing for the perfume of all the roses in the world, but if there be a carcase within miles of it, will scent it out eagerly and fly to it ravenously.|$|E
