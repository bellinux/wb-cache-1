We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> while you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E

25|$|Water in {{a closed}} jar with an air space over it forms a two phase system. Most of the water is in the liquid phase, where it is held by the mutual {{attraction}} of water molecules. Even at equilibrium molecules are constantly in motion <b>and,</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> while, a molecule in the liquid phase gains enough kinetic energy {{to break away from}} the liquid phase and enter the gas phase. Likewise, {{every once in a while}} a vapor molecule collides with the liquid surface and condenses into the liquid. At equilibrium, evaporation and condensation processes exactly balance and there is no net change in the volume of either phase.|$|E
25|$|Born in Colchester, Essex, Napier is a fast-medium bowler, whose stock {{delivery}} reaches between 85mph-90mph. Napier has {{displayed a}} slower ball in Twenty20 games which has proved hard to spot. As a batsman, Napier can {{be among the}} most deadly not only in domestic cricket but in world cricket also. He has twice hit 16 sixes in an innings, once in a Twenty20 match, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> County Championship match. His fielding has been known to be slightly below par, but it can be put down to the fact that Napier is very injury prone and he cannot afford to throw himself around.|$|E
25|$|Einstein {{notation}} can {{be applied}} in slightly different ways. Typically, each index occurs once in an upper (superscript) <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lower (subscript) position in a term; however, the convention {{can be applied}} more generally to any repeated indices within a term. When dealing with covariant and contravariant vectors, where the position of an index also indicates the type of vector, the first case usually applies; a covariant vector can only be contracted with a contravariant vector, corresponding to summation of the products of coefficients. On the other hand, {{when there is a}} fixed coordinate basis (or when not considering coordinate vectors), one may choose to use only subscripts; see below.|$|E

25|$|Akebono was {{a long-standing}} and strong yokozuna, lasting nearly {{eight years in}} the rank and winning the top {{division}} championship on a further eight occasions. His career highlights include the rare achievement of winning the top division championship in three consecutive tournaments, in 1993. In July 1993 he beat Takanohana and Wakanohana in consecutive matches to win the honbasho when all three ended up tied {{at the end of the}} 15-day tournament, and in May 1997 he defeated Takanohana twice on the final day, once in their regular match <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> playoff, to win his first title in over two years. The competition between Akebono and Takanohana, who reached yokozuna himself in 1995, was said to be one of the great defining rivalries of postwar sumo. The two finished their careers with a 25–25 tie in bouts against one another. At the opening ceremony of the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, a professional sumo wrestler was chosen to represent each of the competing countries and lead them into the stadium. After Takanohana fell ill, Akebono was given the honor of representing Japan in the opening ceremony. Akebono also led other sumo wrestlers in a ring cleansing ceremony at the Opening Ceremony (also meant to cleanse the stadium itself).|$|E

500|$|Several {{directors}} {{associated with}} noir built well-respected oeuvres largely at the B-movie/intermediate level. Samuel Fuller's brutal, visually energetic {{films such as}} Pickup on South Street (1953) and Underworld U.S.A. (1961) earned him a unique reputation; his advocates praise him as [...] "primitive" [...] and [...] "barbarous". Joseph H. Lewis directed noirs as diverse as Gun Crazy (1950) and The Big Combo (1955). The former—whose screenplay was written by the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo, disguised by a front—features a bank hold-up sequence shown in an unbroken take of over three minutes that was influential. The Big Combo was shot by John Alton and took the shadowy noir style to its outer limits. The most distinctive films of Phil Karlson (The Phenix City Story [...] and The Brothers Rico [...] ) tell stories of vice organized on a monstrous scale. The work of other directors in this tier of the industry, such as Felix E. Feist (The Devil Thumbs a Ride , Tomorrow Is Another Day [...] ), has become obscure. Edgar G. Ulmer {{spent most of his}} Hollywood career working at B studios <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> while on projects that achieved intermediate status; for the most part, on unmistakable Bs. In 1945, while at PRC, he directed a noir cult classic, Detour. Ulmer's other noirs include Strange Illusion (1945), also for PRC; Ruthless (1948), for Eagle-Lion, which had acquired PRC the previous year and Murder Is My Beat (1955), for Allied Artists.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{story and}} {{characters}} were well received. Electronic Gaming Monthly {{said it is}} [...] "rich in story and character development." [...] Game Informer and Next Generation agreed that the plot {{was one of the}} game's highlights, the former drawing comparisons to Star Wars, Star Blazers, the Old Testament, and many other Square games, making it [...] "a game every RPG fanatic must play." [...] IGN said the storyline is intricate, engrossing, [...] "deep, complex, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> while even confusing, until more of the real underlying plotline is uncovered." [...] GameSpot said the story is [...] "excellent" [...] and [...] "thought-provoking" [...] but said it can be [...] "a little preachy at times", but {{went on to say that}} the religious and existential themes [...] "enhance the story and [...] understanding of the game's deep characterizations". Game Revolution described the storyline as [...] "epic" [...] and [...] "fabulous" [...] with [...] "many twists and turns" [...] and a large cast of characters. RPGFan said [...] "the story is unique and probably the most complex and interesting of any RPG", giving it a 99% rating for the story. Retrospectively, Edge praised the plot's scope and ambition and the protagonist as the [...] "most complicated Freudian hero" [...] in video games, but said it has a [...] "flawed" [...] script and [...] "muddied" [...] translation, as well as too many cut scenes, especially on the second disc, where the use of the world map is restricted for an extended period and the amount of cut scenes increases. Years after the game's release, Jeremy Parish of Electronic Gaming Monthly called the game's plot [...] "one of the wackiest game plotlines ever", but said that it [...] "actually makes sense" [...] if the player ignores all of the sideplots. IGN, however, stated that despite having too many cut scenes and a sometimes confusing plot, [...] "immersion is a key factor in Xenogears and the questions you may have about the storyline are all answered at some point in the game." [...] Following the PSN release, RPGFan's James Quentin Clark said Xenogears has [...] "hands down the best single story I have seen in any video game," [...] giving it a 100% rating for the story.|$|E

2500|$|The blonde nun (often called [...] "The White Lady") is the {{earliest}} and most famous purported ghost: first {{mentioned in the}} 16th century, the frequency of its appearance peaked {{at the end of}} the 19th century, and it was last recorded in 1903. [...] One of Eleanor Stanford's children from her second marriage, already familiar with the descriptions of the ghost, encountered it in 1896, walking from the drawing room to the staircase. [...] The apparition disappeared when the child tried to touch it. [...] Soon afterwards, another daughter apparently saw the same figure at the top of the stairs. [...] Later in 1896, a friend of the Stanford family, who was staying at Preston Manor in the hope of seeing the White Lady, encountered it in the entrance hall. [...] The man found out (supposedly through talking to the ghost) that it was the spirit of a nun who had been excommunicated and buried on unconsecrated land. [...] More details—including that there were two ghosts, both of whom were nuns who had been excommunicated in about 1535 by a friar, even though one had done no wrong—emerged at a séance held in late 1896. [...] Early in 1897, the skeleton of a middle-aged woman, whose remains were dated to the 16th century by a doctor, was found behind the house during building work; it was secretly buried on consecrated ground in St Peter's churchyard, with help from the Stanford family. [...] A séance held in 1898 reputedly made contact with the now pacified spirits, and only two more sightings occurred of a spirit with the characteristic long fair hair: both in 1903, once in a billiard room <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bedroom.
