An important factor for the <b>acceptance</b> of voice <b>output</b> is its intelligibility. A comparison of the intelligibility of voice output modules shows that good voice intelligibility can be achieved by full synthetic speech as well as by parametric coding or waveform coding techniques. The decisive factors are the effort required to create a vocabulary and for the latter two approaches the choice of a suitable speaker. However, parametric coded and fully synthetic speech are still clearly felt by test persons to be unnatural. (IITB...|$|R
40|$|Flexible {{bronchoscopy}} is {{a clinical}} procedure for {{diagnosis and treatment}} of lung diseases. Transbronchial biopsy is commonly performed after suspicious lesions have been identified on CT images, so it will definitely be beneficial to transfer this 3 D information to the operating room. Since bronchoscopy is an inherently monitor-based procedure, augmentation of video images with guidance or targeting information is straightforward and promises high clinical acceptance due to smooth integration into the clinical workflow. While accuracy and computational speed are clearly important for real-time applications like intraoperative navigation, smoothness of the output is no less relevant. Less jitter of augmented reality overlays increases operator comfort and <b>acceptance.</b> Smooth <b>output</b> may provide benefits when further processing the output like for motion models, or temporal and spatial synchronization of multiple video sequences in the case of repeat examinations or clinical studies. Intra-expert agreement, i. e. mean standard deviation, was 1. 44 - 1. 66 mm and 3. 94 - 5. 80 °. Inter-expert agreement, i. e. standard deviation of means, was 1. 26 mm and 4. 78 °. For four dynamic phantom data sets, the accuracy of our method is between 4. 13 and 5. 93 mm, which is equivalent to previous approaches. Computation time is 0. 98 seconds per frame.

However, before the benefits of tagging can be reaped, users must be motivated to provide videos with tags. This article describes a two-stage study that aimed at collecting the most important motivations for users to tag video material. First, focus groups with internet users were held to elicit all possible motivations to tag videos on the internet. Next, 125 persons ranked these motivations for two cases via an online survey and responded to statements that assessed their <b>acceptance</b> of personalized <b>output,</b> based on their tags.

40|$|A carsharing {{service is}} a form of public {{transportation}} that enables a group of people to share vehicles based at certain stations by making reservations in advance. One of the common problems of carsharing is that companies can have difficulty optimizing the number of vehicles in operation. This paper reports on investigations {{of the relationship between the}} number of cars and the number of reservations per day with either the acceptance ratio or utilization ratio based on the commerciallyoperational dataset of a carsharing company in Korea. A discrete event simulation is run to analyze a round-trip service for every possible number of cars and number of reservations with the <b>output</b> <b>acceptance</b> ratio and utilization ratio. The simulation data revealed that increasing the number of reservations with respect to a certain number of cars will decrease the acceptance ratio, thus increasing the percentage of the utilization ratio. Based on the simulation data results, a rational regression model can achieve high precision when predicting the acceptance ratio or the utilization ratio compared to other prediction algorithms such as the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) models. K-means clustering was used to understand the pattern and provide additional policies for carsharing companies. Consequently, opening a carsharing business is very promising in terms of profit, escalating the level of customer satisfaction. In addition, a small reduction in the utilization ratio by operators will create a large increase in the acceptance ratio...|$|R

40|$|Public {{participation}} {{is considered a}} distinguished feature of Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), and the SEA literature has traditionally identified several benefits attached to it, from more open and transparent decision-making to greater <b>acceptance</b> of plans/programmes' <b>output</b> by the affected population. However, relatively little empirical evidence has been collected so far on the extent and outcomes of public engagement as it is being carried out in current SEA practice. In this article, we present {{the results of a}} study on this theme based on a direct survey of 47 SEA practitioners and scholars from different countries. Respondents were asked to report their experience about a number of items including: the frequency of SEA process featuring deep public participation; its overall influence on plan/programmme-making; the identification of the main factors impeding it; the correlation of public involvement with environmental outcomes; and the increase of costs. Results indicate that public engagement in current SEA practice is still relatively limited and with limited influence on decision-making. The main impeding factors seem to be: lack of political willingness by proponents; insufficient information on the SEA process by the public; and weakness of the legal frames. However, respondents also report that when effective public engagement takes place, benefits do arise and identify a positive correlation between the degree of public involvement and the environmental performance of plans and programmes. Overall, findings suggest that public involvement has indeed the potential to positively influence both SEA and decision-making, although this should be supported from the policy side by stronger legal frames, higher requirements and improved technical guidanc...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} need for NASA {{is the ability}} to accurately model the transport of heavy ions in the Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) through matter, including spacecraft walls, equipment racks, etc. Nuclear interactions are of great importance in the GCR transport problem, as they can cause fragmentation of the incoming ion into lighter ions. Since the radiation dose delivered by a particle is proportional to the square of (charge/velocity), fragmentation reduces the dose delivered by incident ions. The other mechanism by which dose can be reduced is ionization energy loss, which can lead to some particles stopping in the shielding. This is the conventional notion of shielding, but it is not applicable to human spaceflight since the particles in the GCR tend to be too energetic to be stopped in the relatively thin shielding that is possible within payload mass constraints. Our group has measured a large number of fragmentation cross sections, intended to be used as input to, or for validation of, NASA's radiation transport models. A database containing over 200 charge-changing cross sections and over 2000 fragment production cross sections has been compiled. In this report, we examine in detail the contrast between fragment measurements at large acceptance and small <b>acceptance.</b> We use <b>output</b> from the PHITS Monte Carlo code to test our assumptions using as an example Ar- 40 data (and simulated data) at a beam energy of 650 MeV/nucleon. We also present preliminary analysis in which isotopic resolution was attained for beryllium fragments produced by beams of B- 10 and B- 11. Future work on the experimental data set will focus on extracting and interpreting production cross sections for light fragments. (C) 2010 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} {{the harmful effects of}} solid waste mismanagement such as wild dumping, open burning and uncontrolled landfilling, many local authorities in Sri Lanka are now willing to invest in Engineered Sanitary Landfills. However, the lack of know-how and expertise is a general barrier for the rapid implementation of this approach in Sri Lanka. In addition, the expertise is not cheap {{when it comes to a}} narrow domain such as engineered sanitary landfilling and in most cases, local, authorities cannot afford to employ such experts, within their budgets The aim of this research is to develop a decision support system that will help local authorities in Sri Lanka to better manage and implement the landfilling projects. A decision support system is computer program that provide expert advice as if a real person had been consul led. These systems capture and deliver knowledge that is not easily represented using traditional computing approaches. It could be used by Local Authorities in planning and implementing landfill facilities. It can training tool for the staff while avoiding the cost of living a human expert. The central core of the knowledge base of BESTFill was acquired from the published text books and manuals. This knowledge consists of well established facts, rules, theory and guidelines that had been practiced over many years. The knowledge base was divided into four categories as site, technology, safety and post closure. The production rules were applied for the site related questions (site selection etc [...] ) and objects or frames were used for other divisions namely technology, safely and post-closure. A unique feature of BESTFill is that it contains several sub modules by while the user can obtain a comprehensive background knowledge on landfilling and integrated solid waste management. The sub modules were named as literature, info desk, training tool, photo gallery, landfill rapid assessment tool, economics & costing, regulations and reports. As effort was made to make the system more user friendly, by using several user interfaces. The user not require process advantaged background in mathematical programming and computing methods. The BESTFill decision support system was validated in two steps. The first step involved the internal validation of the system through program debugging, error analysis, input <b>acceptance</b> and <b>output</b> generations. The second step involved in validating the system under real application situation. The landfill site at Nuwara Eliya was considered as the most appropriate site for the field validation of the since it comprises the basic essential criteria of an engineered sanitary landfill. BESTFill will serve as a guidance tool for landfilling applications in Sri Lanka. It is useful in planning, implementing, and trouble shooting at various stages of landfilling for the designers and operators. It helps the user to obtain every single aspects of the landfilling from the planning stage to the closure and post closure maintenance. The main beneficiary of the system will be the local authorities in Sri Lanka, which amounts 311. In the developing process it has been specially taken into consideration by analyzing the requirements, capabilities, weakness of the local authorities as the main largest group of the syste...|$|R

FRAME 3 D is a program for the three-dimensional nonlinear analysis of steel buildings. It aims to overcome the computational challenges posed by full 3 D analysis of steel buildings subject to earthquake ground motion through efficient finite elements that are designed to capture the essence of material behavior and geometry evolution. The element library consists of a plastic hinge beam element, an elastofiber beam element, a 5 -segment modified elastofiber element, a panel zone element, a 4 -noded diaphragm element to model floor slabs, and an elastic translational/rotational spring element to model foundations and compliant supports. The program utilizes a Newton-Raphson iteration strategy applied to an implicit Newmark timeintegration scheme to solve the nonlinear equations of motion at each time-step. Geometric nonlinearity and shear deformation are included in the formulation. This document serves as a User Guide to the program.

In addition, 2 examples illustrating the capabilities and usage of the program are presented. Finally a glossary of all the variables is alphabetically listed at the end of the document...|$|R
40|$|Legislative reforms {{aimed at}} slowing growth of US {{healthcare}} costs {{are focused on}} achieving greater value, defined specifically as health outcomes achieved per dollar spent. To increase value while payments are diminishing and tied to individual outcomes, healthcare must improve at predicting risks and outcomes. One way to improve predictions is through better modeling methods. Current models are predominantly based on logistic regression (LR). This project applied Reconstructability Analysis (RA) to data on hip and knee replacement surgery, and considered whether RA could create useful models of outcomes, and whether these models could produce predictions complimentary to or even stronger than LR models. RA is a data mining method that searches for relations in data, especially non-linear and higher ordinality relations, by decomposing the frequency distribution of the data into projections, several of which taken together define a model, which is then assessed for statistical significance. The predictive power of the model is expressed as the percent reduction of uncertainty (Shannon entropy) of the dependent variable (the DV) gained by knowing {{the values of the}} predictive independent variables (the IVs). Results showed that LR and RA gave the same results for equivalent models, and showed that exploratory RA provided better models than LR. Sixteen RA predictive models were then generated across the four DVs: complications, skilled nursing discharge, readmissions, and total cost. While the first three DVs are nominal, RA generated continuous predictions for cost by calculating expected values. Models included novel comorbidity variables and non-hypothesized interaction terms, and often resulted in substantial reductions in uncertainty. Predictive variables consisted of both delivery system variables and binary patient comorbidity variables. Complications were predicted {{by the total number of}} patient comorbidities. Skilled nursing discharges were predicted both by patient-related factors and delivery system variables (location, surgeon volume), suggesting practice patterns influence utilization of skilled nursing facilities. Readmissions were not well predicted, suggesting the data used in this project lacks the right variables or that readmissions are simply unpredictable. Delivery system variables (surgeon, location, and surgeon volume) were found to be the predominant predictors of total cost. Risk ratios were generated as an additional measure of effect size. These risk ratios were used to classify the IV states of the models as indicating higher or lower risk of adverse outcomes. Some IV states showed nearly 25 % of patients at increased risk, while other IV states showed over 75 % of patients at decreased risk. In real time, such risk predictions could support clinical decision making and custom-tailored utilization of services. Future research might address the limitations of this projectâ€™s data and employ additional RA techniques and training-test splits. Implementation of predictive models is also discussed, with considerations for data supply lines, maintenance of models, organizational buy-in, and the <b>acceptance</b> of model <b>output</b> by clinical teams for use in real-time clinical practice. If outcomes and risk are adequately predicted, areas for potential improvement become clearer, and focused changes can be made to drive improvements in patient care. Better predictions, such as those resulting from the RA methodology, can thus support improvement in valueâ€”better outcomes at a lower cost. As reimbursement increasingly evolves into value-based programs, understanding the outcomes achieved, and customizing patient care to reduce unnecessary costs while improving outcomes, will be an active area for clinicians, healthcare administrators, researchers, and data scientists for many years to come...|$|R
