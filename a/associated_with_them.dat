5|$|Despite {{the violent}} imagery <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> early Scandinavians {{regarded}} the raven as a largely positive figure; battle and harsh justice were viewed favorably in Norse culture. Many Old Norse personal names {{referred to the}} raven, such as Hrafn, Hrafnkel and Hrafnhild.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scholars}} {{argue that}} there is no one High Priest who is the strongest candidate for identification with each of the Wicked Priest passages. The different demises of the Wicked Priest and the tenses <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> are often cited as evidence of the impossibility of a single Wicked Priest.|$|E

5|$|As supercells and {{multi-cell}} thunderstorms dissipate {{due to a}} weak {{shear force}} or poor lifting mechanisms, (e.g. considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating) the gust front <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> may outrun the squall line itself and the synoptic scale {{area of low pressure}} may then infill, leading to a weakening of the cold front; essentially, the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts, becoming purely a downdraft dominated system. The areas of dissipating squall line thunderstorms may be regions of low CAPE, low humidity, insufficient wind shear, or poor synoptic dynamics (e.g. an upper level low filling) leading to frontolysis.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> so they do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit system will be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Japanese crackdowns {{on these}} guerrillas in Luzon were {{widespread}} and brutal. The Japanese Army, Kempeitai and Filipino collaborators hunted down resistance fighters and anyone <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> One example happened to resistance leader Wenceslao Vinzons; {{leader of the}} successful guerilla movement in Bicol. After being betrayed to the Japanese by a Japanese collaborator, Vinzons was tortured to give up information on his resistance movement. Vinzons however, refused to cooperate, {{and he and his}} family, consisting of his father Gabino, his wife Liwayway, sister Milagros and children Aurora and Alexander, were bayoneted to death.|$|E

5|$|This came on {{the heels}} of controversies about whether some of Oppenheimer's students, {{including}} David Bohm, Ross Lomanitz and Bernard Peters, had been Communists at the time they had worked with him at Berkeley. Oppenheimer was called to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he admitted that he had associations with the Communist Party in the 1930s, and named some of his students as being Communists or closely <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> Bohm and Peters eventually left the country, while Lomanitz was forced to work as a laborer. Frank Oppenheimer was fired from his university position, and could not find work in physics for a decade. He and his wife Jackie became cattle ranchers in Colorado. Their reputations were rehabilitated in 1959, and they founded the San Francisco Exploratorium in 1969.|$|E

25|$|Although the Khateek (butchers) are {{generally}} {{viewed as a}} higher caste than Bhangis, the latter refuse to offer cleaning services to Khateeks, believing that their profession renders them unclean. They also consider the Balai, Dhobi, Dholi and Mogya as unclean and do not <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R

50|$|Pole-and-line {{fishing is}} still carried out {{today in the}} Maldives, Ghana, the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Azores. Few pole-and-line boats now {{specifically}} target yellowfin, an incidental take compared to the total commercial catch. In the Maldives, the catch {{is a mix of}} skipjack tuna and small yellowfins that often <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R

5000|$|John Ellis, an {{acquaintance}} of Enid and Becky's, who often <b>associates</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> despite their dislike of him. John Ellis is obsessed with stereotypically [...] "morbid" [...] and [...] "offensive" [...] things, such as Nazis, serial killers, child pornography, guns, circus freaks, torture, snuff films, and so forth. He {{is referred to as}} having a zine called Mayhem which runs stories on these topics.|$|R
60|$|Ermine {{had dropped}} all scruples about Rose's {{intercourse}} with other children, {{and the feeling}} that she might <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> on equal terms, perhaps, was the most complete assurance of Edward's restoration. She was glad that companionship should render the little maiden more active and childlike, for Edward's abstraction had made her believe {{that there might be}} danger in indulging the dreaminess of the imaginative child.|$|R
25|$|Both Koenigs denied these allegations. In {{separate}} statements {{the brothers}} mentioned Paul's membership in Tammany Hall as probative of their claims that Paul {{was a member}} of the Democratic Party, and, as such, unlikely to have <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Intrusion {{prevention}} systems (IPS) {{are effective}} if the attacks have signatures <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> However, the trend among the attacks {{is to have}} legitimate content but bad intent. Intrusion-prevention systems which work on content recognition cannot block behavior-based DoS attacks.|$|E

This categorization is considered essential for appropriate treatment.|$|E
60|$|Her aunt {{sat down}} beside her, and spent the first ten minutes of the drive in enjoining on her proper {{behaviour}} at Lady de la Poer's.

5000|$|Many churches {{linked with}} Affinity would {{consider}} [...] "Bible-centred Christianity" [...] to be reformed, Calvinist, and non-charismatic, although {{some in the}} affiliation would disagree. Thus, many member churches are defined by a rigorous theology, adopting a separatist outlook. They regard churches with differing viewpoints as being in error and refuse to <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> For this reason they rarely join the Evangelical Alliance, a similar but larger organisation with a broader membership.|$|R
50|$|Event flags can {{be either}} local (per-process) or common (accessible {{by more than one}} process). Each process has its own set of 64 local flags, {{numbered}} 0-63. It is also possible to <b>associate</b> the process <b>with</b> up to 2 sets of common event flags. These come in sets of 32 each, and the process can assign them numbers 64-95 or 96-127. They come into existence when the first process <b>associates</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> and disappear when the last process removes its association.|$|R

25|$|The {{harmony of}} Salome {{makes use of}} {{extended}} tonality, chromaticism, {{a wide range of}} keys, unusual modulations, tonal ambiguity, and polytonality.

25|$|In its widest sense, Biblical Hebrew {{means the}} spoken {{language}} of ancient Israel flourishing between the 10th century BCE and {{the turn of}} the 4th century CE.

40|$|VR will {{reshape the}} {{interface}} between people and information technology by offering new ways for the communication of information, the visualization of processes, and the creative expression of ideas.

5000|$|Sydney set {{his sights}} on being a {{businessman}} and persuaded his father to loan him money for several unsuccessful business ventures. While he was trying desperately to start a mercantile enterprise in New Orleans, his sister, Francis, informed him that Angelina Grimké had spoken in Hingham against slavery, and she had greatly impressed their mother. Sydney told his sister that abolitionists were fanatics, and he did not want anyone in the family to <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
