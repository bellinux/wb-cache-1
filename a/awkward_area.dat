A brief account of the predecessors of William Markham is essential for both he and Beilby Porteus built on foundations laid by those who preceeded them in office. It will be observed that Markham, due to his other additional and external duties, was unable to give his diocese the attention such an <b>awkward</b> <b>area</b> of country demanded. He his is best and showed a keen interest in the affairs of the diocese but was unable to reform abuses in appointment for he had not the time at his disposal. Beilby Porteus not only reformed these abuses but also instituted a form of written examination for would be ordinands and specified the course of study. As a parish priest he took a keen interest in the welfare of the clergy and his tenure of the see highlights the problem of finding assistant curates for the northern chapelries {{at a time when it}} was believed there were more clergy than livings. At the same time the poverty of many of his clergy led to Porteus making provision for them. In a dioces e so diverse as Chester, the problem of the Dissenters and Catholics was a more serious problem than elsewhere. The new industrial areas were becoming centres of Methodism and Dissent while the Catholics maintained their strongholds in northern Lancashire, both factors leading to problems which troubled the parish clergy. Education cannot be neglected for both the above groups as well as the Anglicans were exceptionally keen to provide educational facilities in the diocese. The Sunday School movement is markedly detailed in its archives in Chester. Since both bishops were members of the House of Lords it has been essential to account for their actions outside the diocese and see what effect these had on their domestic policy. Finally the problems of the new industrial society are outlined to show how few of the clergy or the bishops really understood the meaning of the changes. Shortage of new churches, old churches too small and combined with an unprecedented increase in population created situations which the old diocesan machinery was unable to solve. ...|$|E

We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles…" [...] Pragmatic particles are the words and phrases utilized to alleviate the <b>awkward</b> <b>areas</b> in casual conversation, such as oh in [...] "Oh, I don’t know" [...] and uh when someone is thinking of something to say. McWhorter stated that lol is utilized less {{as a reaction to}} something that is hilarious, but rather as a way to lighten the conversation.|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} development gap been Africa {{and the rest}} of the world has widened in the past four decades with no reversal of this trend in sight. Africa has responded to its underdevelopment with the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) which seeks to deal with the continent's relative lack of economic progress as a collective by addressing the sources of its poor economic expansion. This paper examines whether NEPAD does indeed address the causes of Africa's underdevelopment and questions the probability of its success. It argues that although NEPAD recognizes and incorporates recent developments in new growth theory, the actual realisation of the vision is going to be <b>awkward</b> because problem <b>areas</b> have been glossed over in the plan.

40|$|Captured {{in a rare}} photograph, Commandant Richard Baer {{and former}} commandant Rudolf Höss strode away from the {{dedication}} of an SS hospital in Auschwitz in late 1944. Following behind them, are officers of lesser note, and behind them- in the background-  a few nurses.   Mostly hidden behind these men, head down, glove in gloved hand is Maria Mandel, the chief overseer of the women’s camp. She is the most powerful, important woman in Auschwitz and yet she barely makes the shot.   Mandel walks alone, not accompanied by her fellow Aufseherinnen subordinates.   She is not in front with her colleagues of equal rank, nor is she at the back with the nurses who share her gender. Instead, Maria Mandel occupies a space of her own: an <b>awkward,</b> middle <b>area</b> that lacks a conceptual framework. Though her job was identical {{to that of a}} man’s, her gender kept her from being “one of the boys. ” And though she was a woman, her job prohibited her from being “one of the girls. ”   In this photo, in the camp system, and in Germany, the women of the SS failed to “fit in. ” They were not the mothers and nurses performing traditional women’s work in service of the Reich. The state asked them to do a man’s job, yet as shown in the above image, these women were not admitted to a partnership of equality in their workplace. Within this system of discrimination and inequality, women devised strategies to conform to the prevailing gender norms that governed camp culture and their employment...|$|R
