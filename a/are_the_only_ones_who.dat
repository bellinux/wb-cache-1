5|$|John Calvin, a sixteenth-century French theologian and {{principal}} {{figure in the}} development of Calvinism, was influenced by Augustine's works. Unlike Augustine, Calvin was willing to accept that God is responsible for evil and suffering; however, he maintained that God cannot be indicted for it. Calvin continued the Augustinian approach that sin {{is the result of the}} fall of man, and argued that the human mind, will, and affections are corrupted by sin. He believed that only the grace of God is sufficient to provide humans with ongoing ethical guidance, arguing that reason is blinded by humans' sinful nature. Calvin proposed that humanity is predestined, divided into the elect and the reprobate: the elect are those who God has chosen to save and <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> will be saved.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{years later}} in 1963, Srintil (Prisia Nasution) and Rasus (Nyoman Oka Antara) are fast friends. Rasus also has romantic {{feelings}} for her. With the hamlet starved and in a depression since the loss of its ronggeng, Sakarya receives a vision that Srintil will become a great ronggeng, capable of saving the hamlet from starvation. He then convinces Srintil to become a ronggeng. She then tries to proves herself to Kartareja (Slamet Rahardjo), the hamlet's ronggeng caretaker and his wife (Dewi Irawan) by dancing at the grave of Ki Secamenggala, the hamlet's founder. Her attempt is only successful after Rasus gave her the ronggeng amulet belonged to the late ronggeng of Dukuh Paruk. Seeing this amulet, Kartareja then announces that Srintil has been chosen by the founder's spirit. Meanwhile, Indonesian Communist Party member Bakar (Lukman Sardi) arrived in the hamlet and convincing local farmers to join the party, saying that the Communist party <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> can help save the wong cilik (underclass) of Dukuh Paruk and their starved hamlet.|$|E

25|$|In , Booster {{is part of}} the manhunt {{to bring}} the resurrected Maxwell Lord to justice. He finds Max but is beaten badly. Fire, Ice, and Captain Atom find him just as Lord uses his psychic powers to the utmost to erase all memory of himself from the minds of the entire world. For some reason, Booster, Fire, Ice, and Atom <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> {{remember}} Lord and see him in recorded images. Trying to convince Batman (Dick Grayson), Booster is horrified to learn that, thanks to Max, the world believes Ted Kord committed suicide. Fire, Ice, and Captain Atom are soon set up by Max to cut them off from allies, but, ironically, Booster is left alone because his reputation is already poor.|$|E
25|$|During the Fear Itself storyline, Steve Rogers {{is present}} when {{the threat of}} the Serpent is known. Following the {{apparent}} death of Bucky at the hands of Sin (in the form of Skadi), Steve Rogers ends up changing into his Captain America uniform. When the Avengers and the New Avengers are fighting Skadi, the Serpent ends up joining the battle and breaks Captain America's shield with his bare hands. Captain America and the Avengers teams end up forming a militia for a last stand against the forces of the Serpent. When it comes to the final battle, Captain America uses Thor's hammer to fight Skadi until Thor manages to kill the Serpent. In the aftermath of the battle, Iron Man presents him with his reforged shield, now stronger for its uru-infused enhancements despite the scar it bears. It is then revealed that Captain America, Nick Fury, and Black Widow <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> know that Bucky actually survived the fight with Skadi as Bucky resumes his identity as Winter Soldier.|$|E

25|$|But {{when the}} series shifted to Oakland {{for the next}} two games, a new X-factor emerged for the Warriors: their home crowd at the Oracle Arena. The {{electric}} crowd, which was the highest paid attendance crowd for an NBA game in the history of that arena, gave the Warriors a huge lift as they blew out Dallas in Game 3, and edged out a close victory in Game 4. As the series shifted back to Dallas, the top-ranked Mavericks found themselves one game from seeing their record breaking season end prematurely. The Mavericks gave their all and staved off elimination in Game 5, but had nothing left in Game 6 in Oakland. The Warriors used a third-quarter 18–0 run, sparked by Stephen Jackson's 13 straight points en route to a franchise playoff record seven 3-pointers, and an unexpected collapse from MVP candidate Dirk Nowitzki (2–13 from the field with 8 points) to finish Dallas and become the first #8 seed to win a best-of-7 series in the first round, and just the third overall in NBA history, following the Denver Nuggets in 1994 and the New York Knicks en route to the 1999 NBA Finals. The Warriors also won their first playoff series since 1991. The Mavericks also became the second team who had a 65+ winning record not to win a championship, the first being the 1972–73 Boston Celtics. To date, they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> were eliminated in the first round.|$|E

As is typical of Afroasiatic languages, Tamazight has a series of [...] "emphatic consonants" [...] (realized as pharyngealized), uvulars, pharyngeals, and lacks the phoneme /p/. Tamazight has a phonemic three-vowel system, but also has numerous words without vowels.|$|E
500|$|The Rhinemaidens are {{the three}} water-nymphs (Rheintöchter or [...] "Rhine daughters") who appear in Richard Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen. Their {{individual}} names are Woglinde, Wellgunde and Flosshilde (Floßhilde), although they are generally treated as a single entity and they act together accordingly. Of the 34characters in the Ring cycle, they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> did not originate in the Old Norse Eddas. Wagner created his Rhinemaidens from other [...] legends and myths, most notably the Nibelungenlied which contains stories involving water-sprites (nixies) or mermaids. The key concepts associated with the Rhinemaidens in the Ring operas—their flawed guardianship of the Rhine gold, and the condition (the renunciation of love) through which the gold could be stolen from them and then transformed into a means of obtaining world power—are wholly Wagner's own invention, and are the elements that initiate and propel the entire drama.|$|E

500|$|Two {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{are also}} depicted. The [...] "Arachnids" [...] or [...] "Bugs" [...] are shown as communal beings originating {{from the planet}} of Klendathu. They have multiple castes; workers, soldiers, brains, and queens, similar to ants and termites. The soldiers <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> fight, and are unable to surrender in battle. The [...] "Skinnies" [...] are depicted as less communal than the Arachnids but more so than human beings. The events of the novel take place during an interstellar war between the Terran Federation and the Arachnids. At {{the beginning of the}} story, Earth is not at war, but war has been declared by the time Rico has completed his training. The Skinnies are initially allies of the Arachnids, but switch to being allies of the humans midway through the novel. Faster-than-light travel exists in this future: spacecraft operate under the [...] "Cherenkov drive", and can travel [...] "Sol to Capella, forty-six lightyears, in under six weeks".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Brockmann argues {{the fact}} that Caligari was filmed entirely in a studio enhances the madness portrayed by the film's visuals because [...] "there is no access to a natural world {{beyond the realm of}} the {{tortured}} human psyche". The sets occasionally feature circular images that reflect the chaos of the film, presenting patterns of movement that seem to be going nowhere, such as the merry-go-round at the fair, moving at a titled angle that makes it appear at risk of collapsing. Other elements of the film convey the same visual motifs as the sets, including the costumes and make-up design for Dr. Caligari and Cesare, both of which are highly exaggerated and grotesque. Even the hair of the characters is an Expressionistic design element, especially Cesare's black, spiky, jagged locks. They are the only two characters in the film with Expressionistic make-up and costumes, making them appear as if they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> truly belong in this distorted world. Despite their apparent normalcy, however, Francis and the other characters never appear disturbed by the madness around them reflected in the sets; they instead react as if they are parts of a normal background.|$|E

In the manifesto, Rodger claimed he originally sought to carry out his attack on Halloween of 2013, but reconsidered because [...] "here would be too many cops walking around during an event like Halloween, and cops <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> could hinder my plans".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{researchers}} believe that experimental research is too complex {{for the general public}} ever {{to be able to give}} proper informed consent. [...] One such researcher is Eugene G.

Yalow who said [...] "In our laboratory we always used ourselves because we <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> can give truly informed consent." [...] On the other side of the coin, there is the possibility that members of a research team may be coerced into participating by peer pressure.|$|E
