5|$|After {{recording}} drums, {{bass and}} most of the guitars, the band, Giordano and Parker moved to Water Music in Hoboken, New Jersey. The rest of the guitars and the vocals, strings and cowbells were recorded there, and recording was complete by April. Giordano, Parker <b>and</b> <b>Ted</b> Young mixed the recordings, <b>and</b> <b>Ted</b> Jensen did the mastering; Mike Sapone contributed programming to the songs. Girl Next Door String Quartet provided the strings, arranged by conductor Ray Zu-Artez (who played piano). Neil Rubenstein of These Enzymes and Nick Torres of Northstar contributed vocals to some songs. In retrospect, Fred Mascherino considered the sessions rushed.|$|E

5|$|Computer Space is a space combat arcade game {{developed}} in 1971 {{as one of}} the last games created in the early history of video games.

Computer Space is a derivative of the 1962 computer game Spacewar!, possibly the first video game to spread to multiple computer installations. It features a rocket, controlled by the player, engaged in a missile battle with a pair of flying saucers set against a background starfield. The goal is to score more hits than the enemy spaceships within a set time period, which awards a free round of gameplay. The game is enclosed in a custom fiberglass cabinet in one of four colors, which Bushnell designed himself to be futuristic.|$|E
