5|$|<b>A</b> <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> female {{workers of}} the bee species Apis cerana are {{reported}} to activate their ovaries than those of Apis mellifera or Apis florea. When queens were removed, up to 40% of the workers activated their ovaries in subsequent days. However, policing workers continued to eat the worker-laid eggs, suggesting that the mechanism of policing in this species does not involve direct intervention from the queen.|$|E
5|$|At FBI headquarters, Deputy Director Alvin Kersh calls John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{into his}} office. He informs them that Mulder {{has applied for}} {{reinstatement}} to the X-Files. He intends to deny the request, claiming <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> success with Doggett. Kersh ignores Doggett and Skinner's defenses of Mulder, perceiving {{him to be a}} crusader unfit for proper Bureau work.|$|E

5|$|Common ravens nesting near {{sources of}} human garbage {{included}} <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> food waste in their diet, birds nesting near roads consumed more road-killed vertebrates, and those nesting far from these sources of food ate more arthropods and plant material. Fledging success was higher for those using human garbage {{as a food}} source. In contrast, a 1984–1986 study of common raven diet in an agricultural region of south-western Idaho found that cereal grains were the principal constituent of pellets, though small mammals, grasshoppers, cattle carrion and birds were also eaten.|$|E
5|$|In May 1981, Paramount Pictures {{acquired}} the film rights, with Stigwood attached as a producer. Paramount allocated {{a budget of}} $15 million, and the film was scheduled to go into production by year-end. To avoid higher production costs, Stigwood, Rice and Lloyd Webber each agreed to take a smaller salary but <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the film's gross. Stigwood hired Ken Russell to direct the film, based {{on the success of}} their previous collaboration, Tommy (1975).|$|E

5|$|Ingham (1991) {{shows how}} small, {{independent}} {{iron and steel}} manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.|$|E
5|$|The {{approximate}} population {{figure for}} Uxbridge North {{was recorded in}} 2009 by the Office for National Statistics as 11,812, and 11,887 in Uxbridge South. The majority of residents in Uxbridge North were white, with 85% categorised, against 79% for the entire borough of Hillingdon. Uxbridge South also had a majority of white residents, matching the borough figure. In both wards, the remaining percentage {{was made up of}} mixed-race, Asian or Asian British, Black or Black British, and Chinese or other ethnic groups. Of the two wards, Uxbridge South had <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> black and Chinese residents, when compared with the borough.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the lockout, <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> players signed contracts worth the maximum amount possible under the cap. Some young players, such as LeBron James, began signing shorter contracts that allowed for more flexibility in team choice and salary. The agreement expired in 2005, and both sides became concerned {{about the possibility of}} another work stoppage. A lockout was prevented, however, when a six-year CBA was reached in June 2005. After the expiration of that CBA, a lockout occurred in 2011; it was the fourth in league history and lasted for about five months before the sides came to an agreement. Each team's schedule in the 2011–12 NBA season was cut by 16 games.|$|E

5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} alcohol dependence {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E
