The provision of <b>a</b> disability <b>grant</b> is prescribed in Section 9 of the afore-mentioned Act which sets out the qualifying criteria <b>for</b> <b>a</b> disability <b>grant</b> which stipulates that the <b>applicant</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> disability <b>grant</b> should have attained the prescribed age at the time of application. The Act further prescribes that, owing to the applicant’s physical or mental disability, which is unable to secure employment or profession to enable him/her to provide for his/her maintenance, may also submit an application. The {{purpose of the study was}} to “Evaluate the policy regulating access to South African Social Security Agency’s disability grant in Umlazi Township”. The focus is on the Umlazi Township in the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality in the KwaZulu-Natal Province. The data collection techniques used in the collection of data was qualitative in nature. A semi-structured questionnaire with a mixture of a five-point Likert scale and open-ended questions was administered. The major findings of the study included the lack of policy for the disability grant, the lack of relevant training for staff and medical practitioners, the lack of community engagement and awareness, medical practitioners who use their discretion to make recommendations to the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) administrators, the risk of inclusion and exclusion errors caused by poor gate-keeping, the impact of poverty, unemployment and the chronic illnesses resulting to demand for disability grants.

(1999) presented 238 psychologists with CVs from actual scientists; only the names were changed. Female tenure candidates were four times as likely to receive cautionary comments such as “we would have to see her job talk ” and “I would need to see evidence that she had gotten these grants and publications on her own. ” • Letters A study of over 300 recommendation letters for successful medical faculty applicants found that letters for females were shorter, placed less emphasis on research, more emphasis on teaching, contained more “grindstone adjectives ” such as “hardworking ” and “diligent, ” contained twice as many doubt-raisers, and were less likely to include stand-out adjectives such as “brilliant ” and “superb ” (Trix & Psenka, 2003). • Publications A study of postdoctoral fellowships awarded in Sweden found that peer reviewers gave female applicants lower scores than male applicants who displayed the same level of scientific productivity (Wenneras and Wold, 1997). • Funding Success Analysis of 128 <b>applicants</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> prestigious <b>grant</b> in Europe found that differences in male and female success rates depended on the discipline. Gender disparities were especially pronounced in Biology and the Earth Sciences (Brouns, 2000). During 2001 - 2003 female <b>applicants</b> <b>for</b> NIH grants received only 63 % of the funding that male applicants received (RAND, 2005). • Salaries Recent data indicate there is still a statistically significant differential (2. 9 %- 8. 4 %) in starting salaries for men and women faculty with comparable experience and rank (Toumanoff, 2005). Studies also show that salaries for women don’t progress as quickly as salaries for men (Valian, 2005). • Small Numbers Research has shown that women and minorities are judged more fairly when they are at least 30 % of the applicant pool (Sackett et al., 1991; Heilman, 1980) ...|$|R

In present time there is the modern trend in this domain the build-up and extend the quality safety and functional cycle paths and routes which should contribute to support at the progressive cycle transport intensity increase. The evident key question of the next cycle transport development is sufficient financial means for the build-up of cycle paths and cycle routes. Classical home sources are public and regional budgets though limited and mostly are not managing financing all costs. But they are acceptable as one of several financial services. The most notable home source is the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure which provides a year considerable finance means for the build-up of cycle paths and cycle routes. In 2009 SFTI budget proposition is set 180 million crowns aside for these purposes the contribution can be provided for project up to 65 % of relevant costs. The rules {{make it possible to}} co financing the projects which have received grants from EU Structural Funds. The foreign source is first of all EU Structural Funds. In actual period 2007 – 2013 are Regional Operational Programs acceptable. They are based on the statistical units NUTS II which are situated in the Czech Republic {{with the exception of the}} capital city Praha. They are Moravskoslezsko, Střední morava, Střední Čechy, Jihovýchod, Severovýchod Severozápad and Jihozápad. An <b>applicant</b> gives request <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> in terms of the competent ROP who is belonging to the respective one. Every ROP offers another level of financial means University of Pardubice, Jan Perner Transport Fakulty which are classified into Priority Axes. Alike as in last period there are set similar conditions of the grant namely that of these ROP there can be financing maximum 85 % of relevant costs. Except for the financial scope the cycle support can be even a layout cycle paths and cycle routes at railway bodies after cancelled railway´s tracks whose parameters are similar as cycle paths or (if you like) routes parameters and then the reconstruction of railway body is not so financially demanding. Next possibility is to build-up cycle paths and cycle routes along water streams, but the build-up can be made as roads for more categories of transport because the roads are used even for the River-Basins vehicles. The legislative possibility for cycle support is so–called Landed Estate Modifications which solve even strained legal relations of the landholders over which a layout cycle paths and cycle routes is planned. The aim of the article is to demonstrate the support means for build-up of cycle paths and cycle routes...|$|R
