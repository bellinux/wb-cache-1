As they advanced, the teams carried their points forward from previous matches against other teams <b>advancing</b> alongside them, giving them an incentive to perform well in the group stages. The top four teams from the Super 6 stage progressed to the semi-finals, with the winners playing in the final.|$|E

5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the <b>advancing</b> and receding contact angles. The <b>advancing</b> contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, on the Roman left wing, Severus {{must have}} {{suspected}} the prepared ambush, and held back from <b>advancing</b> into the woods, according to Ammianus. Libanius contradicts this, {{claiming that the}} Romans charged the enemy and flushed {{them out of their}} hiding places. But Ammianus' version is more likely, as the Romans would hardly have benefited from <b>advancing</b> straight into a prepared trap. Ammianus does not report further action in this sector. But {{it is likely that the}} hidden Germans eventually lost patience, advanced out of the woods and charged at Severus' division, only to be routed by Severus' crack troops.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Mons {{took place}} {{as part of}} the Battle of the Frontiers, in which the <b>advancing</b> German armies clashed with the <b>advancing</b> Allied armies along the Franco-Belgian and Franco-German borders.

The British reached Mons on 22 August and at the time, the French Fifth Army, located on the right of the British, was heavily engaged with the German 2nd and 3rd armies at the Battle of Charleroi. The British agreed to hold the line of the Condé–Mons–Charleroi Canal for twenty-four hours, to prevent the <b>advancing</b> German 1st Army from threatening the French left flank.
