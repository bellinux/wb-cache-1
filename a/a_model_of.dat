40|$|Abstract:- With the {{assumption}} that cognition is possible, this paper attempts to construct <b>a</b> mathematical <b>model</b> <b>of</b> cognition. It is argued that for <b>a</b> holistic <b>model</b> <b>of</b> cognition, one should {{take care of the}} idea of closeness. In turn, this gives rise to <b>a</b> topological <b>model</b> <b>of</b> the agent, who is capable of cognition. Some possibilities such as computing and etcetera in such <b>a</b> <b>model</b> are discussed for assessing the implications of this visualization...|$|R

The structure of DNA was studied by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins using X-ray crystallography, which led James D.

5|$|Besides {{religious}} imagery, the frescoes of the Donja Kamenica church {{also include}} eleven portraits of contemporary historical figures, separated into four compositions. Three of the compositions are uncaptioned, making {{the identification of}} the people practically impossible. The first composition is located in the cella and depicts two men preserved from the waist up, of which one holds <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> the church, and a child, of which only the head is visible today. The second composition was painted on the upper west wall of the narthex and portrays a man, a woman, a boy and a girl, with the man also holding <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> the church, a common symbol of donorship. Art historian Dragana Frfulanović believes that the images of men holding models in both compositions depict the same person, the main donor. The third composition is in the cella and depicts two men: a monk and a priest.|$|E

5|$|When {{interpreted}} as a proof within a first-order set theory, such as ZFC, Dedekind's categoricity proof for PA shows that each <b>model</b> <b>of</b> set theory has <b>a</b> unique <b>model</b> <b>of</b> the Peano axioms, up to isomorphism, that embeds as an initial segment <b>of</b> all other <b>models</b> <b>of</b> PA contained within that <b>model</b> <b>of</b> set theory. In the standard <b>model</b> <b>of</b> set theory, this smallest <b>model</b> <b>of</b> PA is the standard <b>model</b> <b>of</b> PA; however, in <b>a</b> nonstandard <b>model</b> <b>of</b> set theory, it may be <b>a</b> nonstandard <b>model</b> <b>of</b> PA.

5|$|In 1907, Einstein {{proposed}} <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> {{matter where}} each atom in a lattice structure {{is an independent}} harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting {{the frequency of the}} actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined this model.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, {{building}} on Wolfgang Pauli's work, Paul Dirac produced <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> the electron– the Dirac equation, consistent with relativity theory, by applying relativistic and symmetry considerations to the hamiltonian {{formulation of the}} quantum mechanics of the electro-magnetic field. In order to resolve some problems within his relativistic equation, Dirac developed in 1930 <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles with negative energy, later dubbed the Dirac sea. This led him to predict {{the existence of a}} positron, the antimatter counterpart of the electron. This particle was discovered in 1932 by Carl Anderson, who proposed calling standard electrons negatrons, and using electron as a generic term to describe both the positively and negatively charged variants.|$|E

5|$|More detail {{was given}} in Darwin's 1868 book on The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, which tried to explain {{heredity}} through his hypothesis of pangenesis. Although Darwin had privately questioned blending inheritance, he struggled with the theoretical difficulty that novel individual variations would tend to blend into a population. However, inherited variation could be seen, and Darwin's concept of selection working on a population {{with a range of}} small variations was workable. It was not until the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s that <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> heredity became completely integrated with <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> variation. This modern evolutionary synthesis had been dubbed Neo Darwinian Evolution because it encompasses Charles Darwin's theories of evolution with Gregor Mendel's theories of genetic inheritance.|$|E
