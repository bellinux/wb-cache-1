5|$|Andrei and Daniil <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{decoration}} {{of a church}} in Vladimir. Although they {{have been there for}} several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders in out of the rain and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} save costs, an {{increasing}} number of polyester intermediate producers like spinning mills, strapping mills, or cast film mills <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> direct use of the PET-flakes, from the treatment of used bottles, with a view to manufacturing {{an increasing number of}} polyester intermediates. For the adjustment of the necessary viscosity, besides an efficient drying of the flakes, it is possibly necessary to also reconstitute the viscosity through polycondensation in the melt phase or solid-state polycondensation of the flakes. The latest PET flake conversion processes are applying twin screw extruders, multi-screw extruders or multi-rotation systems and coincidental vacuum degassing to remove moisture and avoid flake pre-drying. These processes allow the conversion of undried PET flakes without substantial viscosity decrease caused by hydrolysis.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Fischbach and {{his colleagues}} <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Simons Simplex Collection (SSC), which is {{designed}} to identify genetic factors that increase the risk of autism. [...] Over 100 researchers and 13 universities have interviewed and collected blood samples from more than 2000 families to look for a genetic linkage to autism. The majority of tested individuals have moderate to severe autistic symptoms and do not display high levels of intellectual disability. [...] Additionally, autistic individuals from enrolled SSC families exhibit genetic deletions, duplications, and copy number variants (CNVs) that are not present in unaffected family members. [...] Siblings serve as ideal control groups to identify unique CNVs associated with autism. [...] Although CNVs are rare and are found in only up to 1% autistic individuals, the presence of multiple CNVs in autistic individuals may account for a larger fraction of autism cases. Ultimately, the goal of the SSC is to expand the number of individuals enrolled in the program in hope of identifying penetrant CNVs, small de novo mutations, and single nucleotide polymorphisms that are linked to a higher risk of autism.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Newman {{composed}} the film's original score. In regards to incorporating his own musical style to the film's period setting, Newman stated that [...] "there was {{room for a}} real tune-based score here that could reflect the basic joy {{in that kind of}} writing that the Sherman Brothers brought to Mary Poppins. Newman, however, refrained from creating an [...] "adaptation score" [...] of the Shermans' music from the original film. Newman's process of scoring the film included playing themes to filmed scenes, so that he could [...] "listen to what the music does to an image", and not wanting to [...] "clutter the proceedings with music." [...] The flashback sequences to Travers' childhood provided the most work for Newman. He explains that, [...] "You had to turn on a dime to make the transition back to the 'present,' when Travers and the Sherman brothers <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> script for Mary Poppins. And that was fun, but also musically challenging.” For the score's instrumentation, Newman primarily employed a string orchestra with some woodwinds and brass, as well as including piano and hammered instruments that were [...] "appropriate to the time period", such as dulcimers. The film's score was recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage in Los Angeles, while the cast recorded several of the Shermans' songs at Capitol Studios for use as playback during the film's diegetic music scenes, including [...] "Chim Chim Cher-ee", [...] "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", [...] "A Spoonful of Sugar", [...] "Fidelity Fiduciary Bank", [...] "Feed the Birds", and [...] "Let's Go Fly a Kite". Walt Disney Records released two editions of the soundtrack on December 10, 2013: a single-disc and a two-disc digipak deluxe edition, containing original demo recordings by the Shermans and selected songs from Mary Poppins.|$|E

Here lies one of the reasons, why We impose self-restraint on Ourselves in our speeches; the experience, that we made in 1942 with papal addresses, which We authorized to be forwarded to the Believers, justifies our opinion, as far as We see.... The Holy See has done whatever was in its power, with charitable, financial and moral assistance. To {{say nothing of the}} substantial sums which we spent in American money for the fares of immigrants." ...|$|E

It is George II's birthday (30 October) (indicated by the flag flying on the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields in the background) and {{the inhabitants of the}} scene are no doubt toasting his health. Under the sign of the Barley Mow, a blacksmith or cooper sits with a foaming tankard {{in one hand and a}} leg of beef in the other. Together with a butcher—his steel hangs at his side—they laugh with the pavior (sometimes identified as a drayman) as he courts a housemaid (the key she holds is a symbol of domesticity). Ronald Paulson suggests a parallel between the trinity of signs of ill-omen in Gin Lane, the pawnbroker, distiller, and undertaker, and the trinity of English [...] "worthies" [...] here, the blacksmith, pavior, and butcher. Close by a pair of fish-sellers rest with a pint and a porter sets down his load to refresh himself. In the background, two men carrying a sedan chair pause for drink, while the passenger remains wedged inside, her large hoop skirt pinning her in place.

However, on January 11, 2010, de Luca confirmed that work on a Metal Gear film adaptation was postponed indefinitely. He said Konami expressed concern that the entire Metal Gear franchise could be seriously affected if a movie version performed poorly. In March 2012, during The Art of Video Games exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Hideo Kojima stated, [...] "Honestly, I'm a movie fan and that's very special to me. I honestly would love to make a movie someday, but that said, I {{think it has to be}} a certain special game that has to provide that right setting. But I don't think that game will be Metal Gear Solid. Metal Gear Solid was developed specifically to become a game. ...If it were to be made into a movie it would have to be something completely new. I wouldn't use my current scripts. I think I'd have to get somebody to get a new script and somebody else to direct it as a movie." [...] At the Metal Gear 25th Anniversary on August 30, 2012, Hideo Kojima announced that Arad Productions, owned by Arad brothers Avi and Ari, have agreed to produce a movie version of Metal Gear Solid with Columbia Pictures. Columbia's parent company, Sony Pictures Entertainment, will be in charge of distribution. On June 3, 2014, Deadline reported that Sony are eyeing Jordan Vogt-Roberts to direct the film. On March 30, 2015, Sony Pictures announced that Jay Basu will write the screenplay. In February 2017, Vogt-Roberts said the filmmakers <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> film's script with Kojima and making it either an R or a PG-13 film rating.|$|E
