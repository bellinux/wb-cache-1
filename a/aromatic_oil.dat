Saffron's main colourant is the flavonoid crocin; it has been discovered in the less tediously harvestedand hence less costlygardenia fruit. Research in China is ongoing. In Europe saffron threads were {{a key component of}} an <b>aromatic</b> <b>oil</b> known as crocinum, which comprised such motley ingredients as alkanet, dragon's blood (for colour), and wine (again for colour). Crocinum was applied as a perfume to hair.
