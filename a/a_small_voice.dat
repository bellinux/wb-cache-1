500|$|While [...] "Abyssinia, Henry" [...] is {{well known}} for the {{departure}} of McLean Stevenson from the series, it was also the final episode in which Wayne Rogers appeared. During the summer 1975 break between seasons three and four, he quit the series. 20th Century Fox sued him for breach of contract, but the lawsuit collapsed. The character of Trapper John McIntyre was subsequently written off the series in [...] "Welcome to Korea," [...] the first episode of the next season, though Rogers had <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice</b> role in that episode as a PA announcer at Kimpo Air Base.|$|E
2500|$|He had <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice</b> role in NBC sitcom 30 Rock, in the [...] "Audition Day" [...] episode.

2500|$|Electrostatic {{loudspeakers}} use a {{high voltage}} electric field (rather than a magnetic field) {{to drive a}} thin statically charged membrane. Because they are driven over the entire membrane surface rather than from <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice</b> coil, they ordinarily provide a more linear and lower-distortion motion than dynamic drivers. They also have a relatively narrow dispersion pattern that can make for precise sound-field positioning. [...] However, their optimum listening area is small {{and they are not}} very efficient speakers. [...] They have the disadvantage that the diaphragm excursion is severely limited because of practical construction limitations—the further apart the stators are positioned, the higher the voltage must be to achieve acceptable efficiency. [...] This increases the tendency for electrical arcs as well as increasing the speaker's attraction of dust particles. Arcing remains a potential problem with current technologies, especially when the panels are allowed to collect dust or dirt and are driven with high signal levels.|$|E

6000|$|... 'The Signora's nephew,' he explained, briefly, curtly, in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice.</b> It {{was as if}} he were ashamed, or {{too deeply}} chagrined.|$|E

6000|$|... "WAIT a minute!" [...] implored <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice,</b> and {{the girl}} noticed a yellow {{butterfly}} that had just settled down upon the stone. [...] "Aren't you the child from the farm?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Jukes yelled [...] "Are you there, sir?" [...] and listened. Nothing. Suddenly {{the roar}} of the wind fell {{straight}} into his ear, but presently <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice</b> shoved aside the shouting hurricane quietly.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't that I don't {{like the}} man," [...] he said, in <b>a</b> rather <b>small</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "But I knew {{if he went}} on I should have to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{we discuss}} that," [...] {{he said in}} <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> quiet <b>voice,</b> [...] "let us go into a private room. I have {{something}} very particular to say." ...|$|R
