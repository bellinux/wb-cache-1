40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effect of organic content level on ultimate methane potential and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of substrate by biochemical methane potential assay. Three organic matters (whole sludge and liquid and solid fraction of sludge) of the same origin, which had different organic contents, were fermented at the batch anaerobic reactor for 70 days. Ultimate methane potential and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> were determined {{by the terms of}} volatile solid (VS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Volatile solid contents of whole sludge and solid and liquid fraction of sludge were 2. 4, 18. 8, and 0. 2 % and COD were 5. 3, 30. 4, and 0. 5 %, respectively. Ultimate methane potentials (Bu-VS) and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> (DVS) determined by VS content were 0. 5 Nm 3 kg- 1 -VSadded, 76. 3 % for whole sludge, 0. 5 Nm 3 kg- 1 -VSadded, 76. 3 % for the liquid fraction of sludge, and 0. 6 Nm 3 kg- 1 -VSadded, 77. 0 % for the solid fraction of sludge. Ultimate methane potentials (Bu-COD) and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> (DCOD) determined by COD were 0. 2 Nm 3 kg- 1 -CODadded, 73. 4 % for whole sludge, 0. 2 Nm 3 kg- 1 -CODadded, 74. 0 % for the liquid fraction of sludge, and 0. 33 Nm 3 kg- 1 -CODadded, 99. 1 % for the solid fraction of sludge. In conclusion, ultimate methane potential and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> given by the VS term showed more reasonable results because COD might be underestimated by the interference of NH 4 + in the case of highly concentrated organic material...|$|E
40|$|Cork boiling {{wastewater}} (CBW) is an aqueous {{and complex}} effluent of the cork industry which is produced during the boiling of the cork planks, {{one of the}} key operations in cork processing for cork stoppers production. CBW contains suspended and dissolved solids and organic materials such as phenolic compounds and is characterized by a low biodegradability and an acid pH. This boiling wastewater has no utility, being a serious environmental hazard. Anaerobic digestion is a promising technology for the treatment of organic effluents and for the simultaneous recovery of its energetic potential through methane production. Its application to cork effluents has never been subject of research. An anaerobic assay was conducted {{in order to determine the}} gas potential and biodegradability of the substrate using a mesophilic <b>anaerobic</b> consortium. <b>Biodegradability</b> batch experiments were performed at CBW concentrations of 3 and 6 kg COD m- 3. The cork industry effluent was characterized (COD = 6. 5 kg m- 3; pH = 5. 8). The liquid phase was analysed at the end of the experiment (pH, COD, total phenols).

40|$|The aerobic DR 4 and <b>anaerobic</b> BM 100 <b>biodegradability</b> {{tests are}} {{currently}} applied in England and Wales for monitoring {{the reduction in}} biological municipal waste (BMW) achieved by mechanical biological treatment (MBT) plants (Environment Agency 2005). The protocol is applied only when outputs are landfilled {{and is based on}} estimating the reduction in potential biogas production between the MBT input, municipal solid waste (MSW), and all of the landfilled outputs, using the BM 100 test. As this is a long term 100 day test the more rapid 4 day DR 4 test may also be applied as this has been shown to correlate with the BM 100 test. We have now applied the DR 4 and BM 100 tests to 132 organic waste samples including untreated and treated BMW and specific organic wastes. The results indicate that the correlation between the DR 4 and BM 100 tests has proved valid for mixed MSW derived BMW wastes. However when both tests are applied to specific organic wastes such as turkey feathers, cardboard packaging waste and pizza food wastes the correlation between the tests is less strong. It is concluded that the use of the DR 4 and BM 100 test correlation is valid for its designed application (monitoring MBT processes treating MSW derived mixed BMW), but that caution should be exercised when applying both tests to specific single component organic wastes...|$|R

By measuring the difference in the gas volumes produced in the sludge inoculum plus test substance and the corresponding control (sludge inoculum only) and converting the gas volumes to the percentage degree of biodegradation, this test allows the quantification of the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of the test substance.|$|E
40|$|Addressing {{the issues}} of water {{shortage}} and appropriate sanitation in Jordan, domestic grey water treatment receives growing interest. Grey water comprises the domestic wastewater flows excluding waters associated with the toilet. The topics of concern for grey water are its characteristics, treatment and potentials for use after treatment. The target of this thesis {{is to develop a}} concept for treating grey water on-site for agricultural usage, thus sustaining a recycling process of grey water in Jordan. A review was made regarding the currently available grey water treatment technologies. In addition, grey water was quantitatively and qualitatively characterized, and then grey water reuse requirements including treatment, were analyzed. Biodegradability and biodegradation rates of the grey water were investigated for selecting appropriate design and operation criteria of the treatment technology to be developed. A low-tech semi-technical scale treatment system was tested to treat grey water discharges from a dormitory at the Jordan University campus. The treatment system was evaluated on obtained removal efficiencies and conformity of the effluent to the guidelines for the use of reclaimed water for irrigation in Jordan. Finally, the objectives, approaches and the results of each chapter are summarized, and then both the results and the potential of applying decentralised sanitation and reuse (DeSaR) concepts in Jordan are discussed. Results show that storage and treatment are prerequisites for any type of grey water use. Grey water is aerobically and anaerobically biodegradable but the conversion rates are low. The core of the treatment concept consists of an integrated storage and anaerobic treatment unit, fed with a natural influent flow pattern, in a down-flow mode, up to a one day operational cycle, i. e. a variable HRT ≤ 24 hours. The second step consists of an aerobic post-treatment, mechanically aerated in a down-flow mode and a one day operational cycle, i. e. 24 hours HRT. Both units need insulation in the winter period. The final effluent, stable in winter and summer, meets the Jordanian standard, except for the pathogens, for usage in restricted irrigation. The achievable treatment efficiency for the CODtot is 44 % in the anaerobic unit and 70 % in the combined anaerobic-aerobic, unlike the high <b>anaerobic</b> and aerobic <b>biodegradability</b> in batch experiments, viz. 70 and 86 %, respectively. The highest removal efficiency achieved was for the CODss fraction, viz. 71 % in the anaerobic and 85 % in the combined system. Therefore, it is expected that the CODtot removal efficiency of the system can be improved, by enhancing the CODcol and CODdis, removal, i. e. applying filtration and/or adding chemicals such as adsorbents, coagulants and/or flocculants to the treatment units...|$|R
40|$|In {{a context}} of {{environmental}} biorefinery, organic residues such as sludge, biowaste, manure are no more considered as wastes but as potential resources for some targeted services. These services encompass the energy production through the methane produced by their anaerobic digestion, the cropped soils fertilisers and amendments production from digestates, and other value-added compounds production (e. g. organic acids and hydrogen obtained during fermentation). There are currently only few studies focused on combined optimization of energetic and agronomic values of organic wastes. One way to optimize both objectives is through process modelling. However, input variables from all existing models are different {{and there is a}} need to find relevant and shared input variables to model the fate of organic residues during their treatments. Recently, a new promising methodology of organic matter characterization has been successfully used to predict <b>anaerobic</b> and aerobic <b>biodegradability</b> and bioaccessibility of a broad range of organic residues (Jimenez et al., 2015). This methodology is based on the combination of chemical fractionation simulating organic matter accessibility and of a 3 D fluorescence spectroscopy highlighting fraction’s complexity. The fractions obtained were used as models input variables. Existing models (Batstone et al., 2002, Zhang et al., 2012, Garnier et al., 2003) have been modified to take into account these new variables. In order to calibrate and validate the models, a lab scale reactor of anaerobic digestion was operated to treat wastewater sludge. Biogas, methane proportion, pH and input and output digestate quality were monitored. After 60 days of steady state operation, the digestate was then centrifuged to separate the liquid from the solid part. The solid part was then added with green waste into a lab scale compost reactor. Temperature, CO 2 production, moisture and compost quality were monitored. Finally, the final compost was used as substrate for cropped soil incubation. First results showed that, the new anaerobic digestion model was successfully able to predict biogas and digestate quality when model and experimental data were compared. The final quality of the solid part of the simulated digestate was then introduced with the green waste fractionation to model composting. The modified compost model also fitted the quality of compost during the different steps of the composting. Concerning soil incubation modelling, experimental results are still ongoing but will be part of the oral presentation. Overall, the obtained results constitute a strong basis for the development of a decision support system to optimize the design and operation of organic wastes treatment plants...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to compare}} the {{efficiency}} of sonolysis and ozonation in improving <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of source sorted organic fraction of municipal solid waste, for the enhancing of biogas production and energy recovery as well.

In this investigation, both sonolysis and ozonation effects on substrate solubilisation and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> were evaluated under different treatment conditions. Results show that both pretreatments can significantly improve the solubilisation of organic solid waste. However, during ozonation experiments, no correlation was observed between increased solubilisation and biogas production: the application of higher ozone doses {{led to the formation}} of by-products less biodegradable than untreated substrate.

30|$|The {{development}} of a new test method suited for the assessment of the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of surfactant under sewage plant simulation conditions is based on an analysis of the existing methods, which are summarized in the Fraunhofer Report on the “Anaerobic Degradation of Detergent Surfactants” to the EU Commission (2002). As the most promising basis, the test method according to DIN 38414, part 8 was chosen. The test method was modified in that way that an accurately known amount of the test substance is added to the sludge inoculum, and that the test substance is added in two sequential steps to overcome possible interferences from unspecific digester gas formation caused by the surface-activity of the surfactant test substance. By measuring the difference in the gas volumes produced (after the second addition of the test substance) in the sludge inoculum plus test substance and the corresponding control (sludge inoculum only) and converting the gas volumes to the percentage degree of biodegradation, this test allows the quantification of the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of the test substance.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the process of}} {{anaerobic}} degradation of organic compounds, {{with the possibility of}} its intensification by means of the cell lysate, is described and an outline of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> test methodology is rendered. Based on literature data the model method for <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> testing of organic compounds was proposed. According to the application, tests were divided into three groups: a) the degradability tests used for the examination of tested material biodegradability; b) the anaerobic biomass activity tests which describe the condition of all fundamental groups of the anaerobic polyculture; and c) the technology tests used for checking and controlling anaerobic processes in the waste treatment plants. Applicability and reliability of the method was verified by many performed experiments. Several samples have been selected for this thesis in order to demonstrate to what degree the tests are representative and the range of their application. By means of the developed method the stimulation effect of the cell lysate to anaerobic biomass, manifested by the acceleration and intensification of the degradation process, was proven. It was found that the effects of lysates prepared from different materials differ and that they also depend on the preparation. The generation of the lysate in the thickening centrifuge, which was proven in our laboratory, has a particularly significant technological impact. In addition, criterion for cell lysate quantification was proposed. <b>Anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> tests of organic compounds enable one to better observe the degradation process and maximally optimize its course.

The influence of adding leachate from a domestic sanitary landfill on the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of domestic sewage has been evaluated in this paper. Five samples were evaluated for the study: 100 % domestic sewage (DS), 100 % leachate (L) and three leachate mixtures (L) with domestic sewage (DS) as follows: 10 %(L) : 90 %(DS), 20 %(L) : 80 %(DS) and 30 %(L) : 70 %(DS).

40|$|Thermal {{pretreatment}} {{systems are}} typically employed to improve waste-activated sludge (WAS) dewaterability and to treat sludge prior to anaerobic digestion. It {{is important to}} understand how WAS properties are affected during pretreatment to be able to assess the performances of processes utilizing pretreated WAS (PWAS). However, there are no generally accepted means of characterizing and comparing pretreatment processes. A pretreatment model for high temperature thermal hydrolysis was developed previously for one pretreatment condition. The motivation for this project stemmed from the need to extend the range of thermal pretreatment conditions to span the range of conditions commonly employed in practice and to evaluate the impact of these pretreatment conditions on WAS chemical oxygen demand (COD) fractionation. The two main objectives of this study were to fractionate the COD of WAS before and after pretreatment for several high temperature thermal pretreatment conditions and to compare the impact of pretreatment on aerobic and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability.</b> The secondary objectives were to investigate how pretreatment affected the rate and extent of aerobic and anaerobic digestion of WAS. The data employed in this study was collected by others following the work of Staples-Burger (2012) and was generated by pretreatment of sludges at 125 °C, 150 °C, and 175 °C for 10, 30 and 50 minutes. Physical and biochemical properties were measured for raw WAS (BR WAS) and PWAS. Offline and online respirometric data were used to evaluate the aerobic biodegradability of BR WAS and PWAS and to fractionate the COD of the BR WAS and PWAS. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests were conducted for BR WAS and PWAS to evaluate the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of BR WAS and PWAS. BioWin® was used to aid in determining the WAS COD fractionation before and after pretreatment, and to determine whether pretreatment changed the aerobic and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of the WAS. It was found that the high pressure thermal hydrolysis (HPTH) pretreatment conditions employed substantially solubilized the COD, organic nitrogen and volatile suspended solids (VSS) in the range of 30 – 55 %, 23 – 41 % and 30 – 89 % respectively. Total COD (TCOD) was however not reduced by pretreatment indicating that organics were not mineralized. These findings closely agreed with the conclusions made in the literature. Pretreatment did not increase the overall extent to which WAS could be aerobically biodegraded. The fraction of non-biodegradable COD as represented by endogenous decay products (Ze) in the BR WAS were not converted to biodegradable form by pretreatment. However, pretreatment increased the rate at which WAS could be aerobically biodegraded as indicated by an increase in the fractions of readily biodegradable COD (Sbsc) in the PWAS. Pretreatment increased both the rate and extent of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability.</b> The ultimate methane yield and the methane production rate were both increased when compared to the ultimate methane yield and methane production rate observed in BMP tests conducted on BR WAS. The experimental results were combined with BioWin® modeling to determine that the BR WAS consisted of 79 % Zbh and 18 % endogenous decay products (Ze). The endogenous decay products fraction remained at 18 % through pretreatment and the concentration of active biomass (Zbh) in PWAS was deemed to be negligible. HPTH pretreatment at the employed temperatures and durations transformed the biodegradable fraction of BR WAS (Zbh) to 16. 5 – 34. 6 % Sbsc and 45. 8 – 63. 6 % slowly biodegradable COD (Xsp) of the TCOD concentration. The same PWAS COD fractionations were employed in <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> test modeling and it was concluded that the aerobic and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of PWAS was different. Up to 50 % of the endogenous decay products were converted to biodegradable substrate (Xsp) due to HPTH pretreatment. It was determined that both pretreatment temperature and duration were important in solubilizing organic matter in the WAS. Increasing the pretreatment temperature and duration generally increased the organics solubilization. However, the impact of pretreatment temperature and duration on WAS COD fractions were inconclusive. The increase in organics solubilization did not correspond to how much of the biodegradable COD of BR WAS was converted to Sbsc by pretreatment...|$|E
40|$|Chlorine {{bleaching}} effluents are {{problematic for}} anaerobic wastewater treatment {{due to their}} high methanogenic toxicity and low biodegradability. Presently, alternative bleaching processes are being introduced, such as elemental chlorine-free (ECF) and total chlorine-free (TCF) bleaching. The methanogenic toxicity and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of ECF and TCF bleaching effluents from oxygen-delignified eucalyptus Kraft pulp were {{compared with those of}} different chlorine bleaching sequences. The effluents from chlorine and ECF bleaching sequences had similar methanogenic toxicities, with 50 % inhibiting concentrations (50 % IC) of 0. 65 - 1. 48 g-COD/litre. Only the TCF bleaching effluent was distinctly less toxic, with a 50 % IC of 2. 3 g-COD/litre. The fact that the ECF bleaching effluent was not less toxic than that of chlorine bleaching, as well as the residual toxicity of TCF, indicate that other substances aside from organohalogens contribute to the high methanogenic toxicity in bleaching effluents. Literature data is presented suggesting that wood resin compounds released by alkaline extraction stages might be important inhibitory substances in all bleaching processes. Oxygen-delignified! bleaching effluents of eucalyptus were found to be highly biodegradable. When tested at subtoxic concentrations, the chlorine and TCF bleaching effluent COD were anaerobically degraded by 67 and 75 %, respectively: In both cases, methane production accounted for most of the COD removed.

40|$|International audienceConsiderable {{research}} has been devoted in the past decades to the optimization and control of biological wastewater treatment processes. Many treatment processes have been studied to increase the methane potential of sludge with a rate limiting hydrolysis stage of organic matters associated with microbial cells. Although numerous informations are currently available about sludge minimization processes in WWTP, as sonication, few data are available about its fundamental mechanisms especially microbial changes. In order to clarify the relationship between sludge reduction efficiency and both chemical and biological modifications, the effects of sonication on activated sludge were investigated by combining the monitoring of cell lysis, organic matter solubilization, floc structure and biodegradability. So {{the aim of this}} study was to characterize the effects of activated sludge sonication, in terms of cell lysis, organic matter solubilization and biodegradability. For this, in parallel to the organic matter solubilization degree determination (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), proteins and sugars), cell disruption in activated sludge was monitored with Flow Cytometry (FCM) before and after sonication. Prior to FCM analyses, activated sludge samples were disaggregated, filtered and stained with a DNA specific fluorescent dye, the Sytox Green, which diffuses only damaged cells. Structural changes during sonication were assessed by microscopic observations and granulometry. Finally, the real impact of thermal treatment on sludge biodegradability was studied under anaerobic conditions. The results showed that, for a specific energy ranging from 0 to 210000 kJ/kg TS, sonication did not induce cell lysis since green fluorescence intensity remained approximately constant before and after sonication. On the contrary, COD, sugars and proteins solubilization degrees reach 27 %, 16 % and 18 % respectively. These results, that showed a progressive release of organic matter particulate components without cell disruption, suggested that the origin of the organic matter released after sonication was only extracellular, probably due to the polymeric network disruption. Moreover, the results from <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> tests did not show any improvement after sonication, indicating that the specific energy was not high enough to increase <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of the sludge. Even if sonication induced a progressive release of organic matter components from particulate to soluble fraction, the specific energy applied was not high enough to induce cell lysis, and consequently, <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> improvement.

40|$|<b>Anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> for sulfolane and thiolane was {{investigated}} in soil and anaerobically digested sludge. Biochemical methane potential was periodically quantified to assess biodegradability of microorganisms degrading the compounds prepared in the closed glass vessel. Relatively lower concentration of thiolane adopted in the test was hardly degraded in the soil. Moreover, its degradation was hindered in anaerobic digest sludge. In contrast, sulfolane was readily decomposed in both the soil and the anaerobic sludge. It is concluded that subsequent occurrence hindered in anaerobic digest sludge. In contrast, sulfolane was readily decomposed in both the soil and the anaerobic sludge. It is concluded that subsequent occurrence of thiolane as one of intermediates generated from the reduction of sulfolane would retard the remediation of the concerned area polluted with sulfolane and thiolane...|$|E
40|$|The {{using of}} the proterins for {{production}} of applicable technical films is limited {{first of all}} with their small mechanical stability. This property is possible to change positively for example by chemical crosslinking. In this work the proteins hydrolysate from enzymatic hydrolysis of shavings from chromium tanned leaxthers {{was used as a}} substrate and as croslinking agents the glutardialdehyde and glyoxal. The degree of crosslinking was simply tested by determination of solubility of the samples and its influence on drop of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> was determined by volumetric methanogenic activity test. On the basis of these experiments it was stated, that under described experimental conditions the degree of crosslinking had substantial influence on the rate and also on degree of biodegradation, but without influence on the acceptable degradation of these products in the environment...|$|E
40|$|Although {{literature}} suggests that aquatic worms can help to enhance the methane production from excess activated sludge, clear evidence for this is missing. Therefore, anaerobic digestion tests were performed at 20 and at 30 °C with sludge from a high-loaded membrane bioreactor, the aquatic worm Lumbriculus variegatus, feces from these worms and with mixtures of these substrates. A significant synergistic effect of the worms or their feces on methane production from the high-loaded sludge or on its digestion rate was not observed. However, {{a positive effect on}} low-loaded activated sludge, which generally has a lower <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability,</b> cannot be excluded. The results furthermore showed that the high-loaded sludge provides an excellent feed for L. variegatus, which is promising for concepts where worm biomass is considered a resource for technical grade products such as coatings and glues. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} sonolysis in improving the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste coming from mechanical selection, thus enhancing biogas production and energy recovery as well. Methane yield of solid organic material anaerobic digestion is significantly affected by substrate availability that was evaluated, in this investigation, through organic matter solubilisation tests carried out at different conditions of ultrasound treatment. Results show that sonolysis can significantly improve the solubilisation of organic solid waste, thus allowing higher biogas production from anaerobic treatment of sonicated substrates. After 45 days, the biogas produced during anaerobic codigestion tests for the sonicated mixture was 24 % higher than untreated one. Therefore, these results can lay {{the basis for the}} development of technologies useful to produce high biogas quantities, in order to improve clean energy generation from biowaste...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAerobic and {{anaerobic}} digestions {{were compared}} in reactors fed with sonicated activated sludge. Sonication treatment of activated sludge led to solubilisation {{of matter and}} especially of organic compounds. An important improvement of aerobic and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> was observed for a sonication treatment of 108, 000 kJ kg TS− 1 due to the increase of the instantaneous specific soluble COD uptake rate. Sonication led to an increase of biogas production due to the increase of available soluble COD. In this study, sludge sonication prior to aerobic digestion in the aim of enhancing sludge reduction was inconclusive. Under anaerobic conditions, the enhancement of sludge reduction due to sonication depended on the disintegration degree of the sludge. The combination of high disintegration degree of sonicated sludge prior to an anaerobic digestion led to very good results in term of sludge reduction (80 %). Energy balance was also studied...|$|E
40|$|Fresh pig/cattle {{slaughterhouse}} waste mixtures, with different lipid-protein ratios, were characterized and their <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> assessed in batch tests. The resultant methane potentials were high (270 – 300 LCH 4 kg 1 COD) making them interesting substrates for the anaerobic digestion process. However, when increasing substrate concentrations in consecutive batch tests, up to 15 gCOD kg 1, a clear inhibitory process was monitored. Despite the reported severe inhibition, related to lipid content, {{the system was}} able to recover activity and successfully degrade the substrate. Furthermore, 16 S rRNA gene-based DGGE results showed an enrichment of specialized microbial populations, such as b-oxidizing/proteolitic bacteria (Syntrophomonas sp., Coprothermobacter sp. and Anaerobaculum sp.), and syntrophic methanogens (Methanosarcina sp.). Consequently, the lipid concentration of substrate {{and the structure of}} the microbial community are the main limiting factors for a successful anaerobic treatment of fresh {{slaughterhouse waste}}.
