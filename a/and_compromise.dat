5|$|When {{tissue is}} {{deficient}} or mutilated {{by the loss}} of teeth, implants are placed and allowed to osseointegrate, then the gingiva is surgically moved around the healing abutments. The down-side of a two-stage technique is the need for additional surgery <b>and</b> <b>compromise</b> of circulation to the tissue due to repeated surgeries. The choice of one or two-stages, now centers around how best to reconstruct the soft tissues around lost teeth.|$|E
5|$|During a {{break from}} concerts, One Direction {{promoted}} their album in the United States. Following an appearance on The Today Show, Up All Night was released in the US and One Direction became the first ever UK group to have their debut album bow atop the Billboard 200. This led to the group extending the tour into North America. On 21 March 2012, One Direction announced the North American leg of the tour. The North American leg would start on 24 May 2012 <b>and</b> <b>compromise</b> out of 26 shows. Shortly after the announcement British recording artist Olly Murs was confirmed to be the opening act for select dates on tour.|$|E

His statement however, was met with strong opposition from the local community, including the Bumiputera community, and he was dubbed as 'ignoramus' upon his statement.|$|E
5|$|In January 2005, the US101 was {{selected}} for the VXX Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program, and was promptly re-designated as the VH-71. However, development was subject to delays, cost overruns, and engineering issues; Lockheed attributed much of these issues to unanticipated and extensive modifications being demanded by the government that had been absent from the request for proposal (RFP) issued. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report in 2011 also recognised {{that a lack of}} flexibility <b>and</b> <b>compromise</b> {{on the part of the}} government had negatively impacted the programme. By late 2008, the cancellation of the VH-71 was looking increasingly likely.|$|E
5|$|Like the spinner shark, the blacktip shark {{is known}} to leap {{out of the water}} and spin three or four times about its axis before landing. Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump out of the water to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin <b>and</b> <b>compromise</b> its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E

5|$|The debating {{chamber of}} the Scottish Parliament has seating {{arranged}} in a hemicycle, a design which is common across European legislatures, intended to encourage consensus <b>and</b> <b>compromise.</b> There are 131 seats in the debating chamber. Of the total 131 seats, 129 are occupied by the Parliament's elected MSPs and two are seats for the Scottish Law Officersâ€”the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland, who are not elected members of the Parliament but {{are members of the}} Scottish Government. As such, the Law Officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the Parliament but, as they are not elected MSPs, cannot vote.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{in the way}} {{research}} ethics was visualised in {{the wake}} of the Nuremberg Trials (1946), led to an atmosphere of protectionism of groups deemed to be vulnerable that was often legislated or regulated. This resulted in the relative underrepresentation of women in clinical trials. The position of women in research was further compromised in 1977, when in response to the tragedies resulting from thalidomide and diethylstilbestrol (DES), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited women of child bearing years from participation in early stage clinical trials. In practice this ban was often applied very widely to exclude all women. Women, at least those in the child bearing years, were also deemed unsuitable research subjects due to their fluctuating hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle. However, research has demonstrated significant biological differences between the sexes in rates of susceptibility, symptoms and response to treatment in many major areas of health, including heart disease and some cancers. These exclusions pose a threat to the application of evidence-based medicine to women, <b>and</b> <b>compromise</b> to care offered to both women and men.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his governorship, al-Ikhshid {{was engaged}} in {{conflicts}} with other regional strongmen for control over Syria, without which Egypt was vulnerable to invasion from the east, but unlike many other Egyptian leaders, notably the Tulunids themselves, {{he was prepared to}} bide his time <b>and</b> <b>compromise</b> with his rivals. Although he was initially in control of the entirety of Syria, he was forced to cede the northern half to Ibn Ra'iq between 939 and 942. Following Ibn Ra'iq's murder, al-Ikhshid reimposed his control over northern Syria, only to have it challenged by the Hamdanids. In 944 al-Ikhshid met Caliph al-Muttaqi at Raqqa; the caliph had fled there from the various strongmen vying to kidnap him and control the caliphal government in Baghdad. Although unsuccessful in persuading the caliph to come to Egypt, he received recognition of hereditary rule over Egypt, Syria and the Hejaz for thirty years. Following his departure, the ambitious Hamdanid prince Sayf al-Dawla seized Aleppo and northern Syria in the autumn of 944, and although defeated and driven out of Syria by Ibn Tughj himself in the next year, a treaty dividing the region {{along the lines of the}} agreement with Ibn Ra'iq was concluded in October. Ibn Tughj died nine months later, leaving his son Unujur as ruler of his domains, under the tutelage of the powerful black eunuch Abu al-Misk Kafur.|$|E

25|$|States do not utilize only infrastructural or only despotic power. The {{two types}} coexist within a state. In 1993 Mann {{clarified}} {{his definition of}} infrastructural power, indicating that despotic states rely on infrastructural power {{as they attempt to}} control their territory. The goal of an authoritarian state is to combine despotic and infrastructural power in a way that allows it the maximum influence over social life. The two types of power exist in tension in weak states; infrastructural power requires a level of cooperation <b>and</b> <b>compromise</b> between institutions that generally undermines despotic power.|$|E
25|$|Some locals in {{the area}} support some kind of {{independence}} from Thailand; others clearly do not. This was shown by the national referendum to support the junta-backed constitution for Thailand, which was favoured by a majority in all three southernmost provinces and passed overwhelmingly in the southern region of Thailand, with 87% of the 3.7 million voters who participated there approving it. Furthermore, while those in the insurgent groups support armed conflict, most southern residents seem to want negotiation <b>and</b> <b>compromise</b> {{and the rule of}} law to return, along with an end to human rights abuses by both sides.|$|E

25|$|Congress has alternated between {{periods of}} {{constructive}} cooperation <b>and</b> <b>compromise</b> between parties known as bipartisanship and periods of deep political polarization and fierce infighting known as partisanship. The period after the Civil War {{was marked by}} partisanship {{as is the case}} today. It is generally easier for committees to reach accord on issues when compromise is possible. Some political scientists speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress has intensified partisanship in the last few decades but that an alternation of control of Congress between Democrats and Republicans may lead to greater flexibility in policies as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Baskerville {{states that}} shared {{parenting}} {{has been demonstrated}} to reduce parental conflict by requiring parents to cooperate <b>and</b> <b>compromise,</b> {{and that it is}} the lack of constraint by one parent resulting from the ability of that parent to exclude the other, that results in increased parental conflict. He further states that only when child support guidelines exceed true costs do parents ask for or seek to prevent changes in parenting time for financial reasons, adding that any argument that a parent is asking for increased parenting time to reduce child support {{is at the same time}} an argument that the other parent is making a profit from child support.|$|E
25|$|Arlosoroff's {{hope for}} {{peaceful}} cooperation <b>and</b> <b>compromise</b> with Arabs would be severely tested. In 1929, the consciously aggressive Betar Youth Movement, organized under Ze'ev Jabotinsky's Union of Revisionist Zionists, {{took part in}} a coalition to assertively enforce and enlarge a Jewish presence in the proximity of the Wailing Wall. The activities of Betar and their associates inflamed an explosive reaction from the Arab community, as it was perceived Muslim mosques on the adjacent Temple Mount had been dishonored. The violent Western Wall Uprisings of 1929 ensued, which resulted in the loss of many lives, including civilians. Instead of inciting further Arab tensions, Arlosoroff strongly criticized the Revisionists for insensitively provoking the animosity.|$|E
