Corrections and associated modeling errors to Pn, Pg, Sn, and Lg IASPEI 91 travel time tables are specified on 1 by 1 degree latitude and longitude “source specific ” grids within 20 degrees of each International Monitoring System (IMS) station. International Data Center (IDC) location software is configured to read and apply these grids when locating events in the Reviewed Event Bulletin (REB). In order to develop regional travel time corrections for IMS stations in North Africa, Middle East, and Western Asia, a consortium was formed of experts in IDC software integration/testing/validation, regional/global body/surface-wave tomography, tectonic regionalization, 3 D ray-tracing, and ground truth (GT) data collection with the goal to improve location accuracy and precision while maintaining honest 90 % coverage ellipses.

5000|$|... array {{processing}} concept was {{closely linked to}} radar and sonar systems which represent the classical applications of {{array processing}}. The antenna array is used in these systems to determine location(s) of source(s), cancel interference, suppress ground clutter. Radar systems used basically to detect objects by using radio waves. The range, altitude, speed and direction of objects can be specified. Radar systems started as military equipments then entered the civilian world. In radar applications, different modes can be used, one of these modes is the active mode. In this mode the antenna array based system radiates pulses and listens for the returns. By using the returns, the estimation of parameters such as velocity, range and DOAs (direction of arrival) of target of interest become possible. Using the passive far-field listening arrays, only the DOAs can be estimated. Sonar systems (Sound Navigation and Ranging) use the sound waves that propagate under the water to detect objects on or under the water surface. Two types of sonar systems can be defined the active one and the passive one. In active sonar, the system emits pulses of sound and listens to the returns {{that will be used}} to estimate parameters. In the passive sonar, the system is essentially listening for the sounds made by the target objects. It is very important to note the difference between the radar system that uses audio waves and the sonar system that uses sound waves, the reason why the sonar uses the sound wave is because sound waves travel farther in the water than do radar and light waves. In passive sonar, the receiving array has the capability of detecting distant objects and their locations. Deformable array are usually used in sonar systems where the antenna is typically drawn under the water. In active sonar, the sonar system emits sound waves (acoustic energy) then listening and monitoring any existing echo (the reflected waves). The reflected sound waves can be used to estimate parameters, such as velocity, position and direction etc. Difficulties and limitations in sonar systems comparing to radar systems emerged {{from the fact that the}} propagation speed of sound waves under the water is slower than the radio waves. Another source of limitation is the high propagation losses and scattering. Despite all these limitations and difficulties, sonar system remains a reliable technique for range, distance, position and other parameters estimation for underwater applications. NORSAR is an independent geo-scientific research facility that was founded in Norway in 1968. NORSAR has been working with array processing ever since to measure seismic activity around the globe.

40|$|The {{recently}} signed Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty provides {{for an international}} network of primary and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>seismic</b> monitoring <b>stations</b> (IMS) to verify its compliance. Calibration is required to confidently use these stations to identify and discriminate between earthquakes, mine-related events and clandestine nuclear explosions, particularly for small to moderate seismic events recorded regionally at only a few stations. Given the lack of regional recordings of underground nuclear tests {{in most of the}} world, we are making use of mining and industrial explosions to test discriminants. For example we use the Multimax compiled dataset of small earthquakes and quarry explosions in Israel to test regional discriminants at local distances with mixed results. Further complicating calibration is the fact that many INK sites have not yet been installed and others have very short operating histories. When IMS data is available, there is often a lack of independent information (ground truth) on the seismic sources. Here we describe a procedure for calibrating stations with limited data and apply it to the IMS auxiliary station MDT in Morocco. Data was initially available for three months in 1990 when MDT was operated as part of MEDNET. An event detector was run over the continuous data and regional events identified and roughly located using S-P time and back azimuth. The procedure uses spatial and temporal clustering to identify ''known'' mine blasts. The spatial clustering is done using the waveform correlation technique of Harris (1991) to find events with similar sources and locations. Temporal clustering looks at the time of day and repetition in time of events with the mine blasts occurring during working hours and days repeatedly over a period of time. A set of ''known'' earthquakes is also determined using location, time of day, distribution in time and size criteria. With these independent libraries of identified seismic events, we evaluate promising regional discriminants such as high frequency P/Lg. We also examine distance and path effects on the discriminants. Preliminary results indicate high frequency P/Lg provides some separation between mine blasts and earthquakes at MDT...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Assessing the {{completeness}} magnitude Mc of earthquake catalogs is {{an essential}} prerequisite for any seismicity analysis.

We show that a relationship of the form Mpredc d adb c, with d {{the distance to the}} kth nearest <b>seismic</b> <b>station,</b> fits the observations well, k depending on the minimum number of stations being required to trigger an event declaration in a catalog. We then propose a newMc mapping approach, the Bayesian magnitude of completeness (BMC) method, based on a two-step procedure: (1) a spatial resolution optimization to minimize spatial heterogeneities and uncertainties in Mc estimates and (2) a Bayesian approach that merges prior information about Mc based on the proximity to <b>seismic</b> <b>stations</b> with locally observed values weighted by their respective uncertainties. Contrary to the cur-rentMc mapping procedures, the radius that defines which earthquakes to include in the local magnitude distribution is chosen according to an objective criterion, and there are no gaps in the spatial estimation of Mc.

40|$|The {{study of}} the three {{dimensional}} structure of the earth {{is limited by the}} uneven distribution of earthquake sources and <b>seismic</b> <b>stations.</b> The distribution of the earthquakes is fixed as most earthquakes occur along the plate boundaries. The use of artificial sources can improve the distribution of seismic sources but such experiments are not popular as they require sources with the strength of a nuclear explosion in order to probe the mantle. The distribution of <b>seismic</b> <b>stations</b> is mainly concentrated in regions with a significant earthquake risk.
