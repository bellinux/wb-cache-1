5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 20 March 2011, a group of 20 to 25 masked men, some armed with rifles and {{accompanied}} by dozens of uniformed Bahraini security forces, broke into Rajab's house. Rajab was detained and his files and a computer were confiscated. He reported that they blindfolded and handcuffed him and put him {{into the back of a}} vehicle before verbally abusing, beating and threatening to rape him. He claimed that they kicked him when he refused to say that he loved the prime minister. He was taken to a Ministry of Interior detention facility in Adliya, a suburb of Manama. After being briefly questioned <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> he did not know, he was released.|$|E

A waitress, Carolyn, played by Anita Wise, overhears them and George offers the place to her, which she accepts. The waitress invites them and Elaine to her housewarming, {{but it is clear that}} Jerry, George, and Elaine are not enjoying themselves.

40|$|The {{overarching}} {{theme of the}} article is that Cognitive Linguistics (CL) must “self-nest ” in a particular, approximate way: in other words, ordinary people studied in CL must themselves be cast as thinking about the commonsensical, and therefore often metaphorical, states of mind of other people—so, to put it metaphorically, we must {{consider the case of}} an oridnary person Una acting as some sort of amateur or folk CList concerning other people. This is especially the case when those other people are themselves thinking about people’s mental states. The argument of the article is based largely on considering mental state reports, in other words sentences that talk <b>about</b> <b>someone’s</b> mental states, and is further buttressed by considering nested mental state reports, in other words sentences that talk <b>about</b> <b>someone’s</b> mental states <b>about</b> <b>someone’s</b> mental states. One claim the article makes is that Una’s conceptions of people’s contentful mental states are likely not only to be inherently metaphorical but to be ineliminably so—Una has no non-metaphorical mental paraphrase of these conceptions...|$|R

5|$|Michelle {{undergoes}} a session of regression hypnosis, where she {{claims to be}} twenty-four years old. She suddenly starts screaming in panic <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> trying to kill her, and the session is ended. Mulder reviews the video of the session, and {{is convinced that the}} girl is the reincarnation of Morris, having been conceived right around the time the detective was murdered. The tape contains a brief section of static noise just before Michelle begins screaming, which Mulder has an expert clean up. The noise is found to contain a grainy image of {{what appears to be a}} fish tank ornament of a man in an atmospheric diving suit. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Morris' autopsy findings, which show the presence of salt water in his respiratory tract, indicating he died of drowning. The agents realise from these findings that Morris was drowned in the exotic fish tank in Fiore's house.|$|E

Veteran writer Sam Bobrick was brought on to write the episode and the cast included future stars Jonathan Brandis, Brian Austin Green, and Jaleel White.|$|E

She said her mother instilled the notion of inner strength in her, and that she wanted the music she makes to be positive.

500|$|... "You're Killing Me", {{the longest}} {{song on the}} EP at three minutes and 20 seconds, {{is an example of}} the impact punk rock had on Pavement.

[...] "Box Elder", an ironic song <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> wanting to move to Box Elder, Montana, was considered by Gerard Cosloy to be an example of Malkmus's [...] "honest, direct, and simplistic" [...] lyrical style, and features greater influence from pop music than the rest of the EP. [...] "Maybe Maybe" [...] features distorted guitars and indiscernible vocals, and [...] "Price Yeah!" [...] has a sound typical of hardcore punk. The band's hometown of Stockton inspired the band's lyrics and sound. Malkmus stated that [...] "There's something empty about Stockton. I wanted to convey that in our music."
