25|$|Pope Shenouda III had {{arguments}} with then President Anwar Sadat over both the Camp David Accords <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was the president's deficient response to growing Islamism. After {{a series of}} protests that led president Sadat to depose Pope Shenouda III, he was exiled by Sadat {{and sent to the}} Nitrian Desert, to return three years after Sadat's assassination following an amnesty by Sadat's successor Hosni Mubarak.|$|E
500|$|In 1924 J. Jovanović {{went public}} stating that his warning {{had been made}} on his own initiative, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was that [...] "Among the Serb youths (in the army) there may be one who will put a ball-cartridge in his rifle or {{revolver}} {{in place of a}} blank cartridge and he may fire it, the bullet might strike the man giving provocation (Franz Ferdinand)." [...] J. Jovanović's account changed {{back and forth over the}} years and never adequately addressed Colonel Lesanin's statement. [...] Bilinski did not speak openly on the subject, but his press department chief confirmed that a meeting had taken place including a vague warning, but there was no mention of an ethnic Serb Austro-Hungarian soldier shooting Franz Ferdinand.|$|E
60|$|Spike {{handed over}} the jewels. The boss was the boss, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> went. But his {{demeanor}} was tragic, telling eloquently of hopes blighted.|$|E
60|$|I {{was puzzled}} <b>and</b> angry. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> made sense somehow, {{but it sounded}} to me like so much gibberish.|$|R
60|$|Lord Castlewell had {{now become}} very {{intimate}} with the O'Mahonys; <b>and</b> by <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> showed also his intimacy with Mrs. Peacock.|$|R
50|$|<b>And</b> this is <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to her...|$|R
60|$|A {{little longer}} they {{lay in the}} warm sand. It was Billy who broke the silence, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> seemed to proceed out of {{profound}} meditation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bow down. Bow down. Bow down!" [...] {{cried the}} deep voice of Bakenkhonsu. [...] "Life! Blood! Strength! Pharaoh! Pharaoh! Pharaoh!" [...] <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> the escort echoed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Could {{you go to}} Geoffrey, and see him, {{and tell}} him all about me and--and come back and tell me how he looks, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> and--and so on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think you}} do him wrong, mamma. I am sure you are doing me wrong. I think his coming was an accident, <b>and</b> that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was--an accident.' ...|$|R
60|$|His honest voice <b>and</b> manner corroborated <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> quite {{established}} its ingenuousness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I assure you, {{my dearest}} mother," [...] replied Hamish, [...] "that I am in no danger. But {{have you seen}} MacPhadraick, mother? <b>and</b> <b>what</b> has <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to you on my account?" ...|$|R
60|$|One of {{them did}} so, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> bore out some, at least, of Ormsgill's assertions. Then the grave figure in the plain white robe raised a hand, {{and there was a}} sudden silence of attention.|$|E
60|$|Only for {{a moment}} did Spike hesitate. Then {{he pulled out the}} jewels, and placed them in Jimmy's hand. Mr. Chames was Mr. Chames, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> went. But his {{demeanor}} was tragic, telling eloquently of hopes blighted.|$|E
60|$|Lady Constantine was {{disturbed}} by {{a break in}} the organist's meandering practice, and raising her head she saw a person standing by the player. It was Mr. Torkingham, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was distinctly audible. He was inquiring for herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's old stock, too," [...] Saxon said. [...] "He told {{me while}} you were undressing. His folks came by Panama before the {{railroad}} was built, <b>and</b> from <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> I guess <b>he's</b> got plenty of money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you're only one, and there's none like you! I {{could never}} see any one else while I looked at you!" [...] he cried, only half {{aware of his}} poetry, <b>and</b> meaning <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> very literally.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{not that}} sort of man," [...] said Dick warmly. [...] "He was {{talking to me about}} her yesterday, <b>and</b> from <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> I am sure he thinks she is the finest girl in the world." ...|$|R
60|$|Joyful news!--to me! Ah, Sir, {{the words}} struck at first with cruel irony upon mine ear. But not so a second later, for the Jewish gentleman went on speaking, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{appeared}} to my reeling senses like songs of angels from paradise.|$|E
60|$|Whit swayed back, coiled and uncoiled. Something thin, white, glancing, shot at Berne. He ducked, {{escaping}} the ball by a smaller margin than appeared good for his confidence. He spoke {{low to the}} Rube, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was probably not flavored with the milk of friendly sweetness.|$|E
6000|$|... "I heard {{where you}} had gone and came to meet you," [...] he said awkwardly. [...] "How well you are looking, Barbara, how well and----" [...] he had meant to add [...] "beautiful," [...] but his tongue {{stumbled}} at the word <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was [...] "brown." ...|$|E
50|$|Well {{before this}} media report, the {{spokesperson}} for the academy had publicly denounced the assassination of Salman Taseer, expressed support for Asia Bibi <b>and</b> criticized <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was the wrong application of the blasphemy laws to the case.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, mamma," [...] Percy said, [...] "from some {{particulars}} <b>he</b> gave, <b>and</b> from <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> I feel almost sure--I may say I {{am quite}} sure--it is Ralph. I {{would not say}} so, you know, unless I felt very certain." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{then out}} of his terror he {{gathered}} an odd daring. He spoke to Garnache as never he had dreamt to speak to him, and {{it may well be}} that by his tone <b>and</b> by <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> saved his life just then.|$|R
60|$|Thus preached the Pasteur, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> gave Godfrey the {{greatest}} comfort. Still, being young, he made one mistake. He did send Madame Riennes some money, {{partly out of}} pity--ten pounds in a postal order without any covering letter, a folly that did not tend to a cessation of her epistolatory efforts.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had caught}} a heavy cold, {{and should have}} stayed in bed had I not been far too anxious; and I am glad I did not, for I had not been many minutes in my sitting-room {{before there was a}} knock at the door, and Harold came in, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was, [...] "Lucy, how does one pray?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{she spoke}} aloud: [...] "Soa, come here while I undress, {{and tell me}} again all about your meeting with Mr. Outram, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> forgetting nothing. You have put me to shame, Soa, with your talk, and I will never forgive you. Tell me also how I can help to win the {{treasure}} of the People of the Mist!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Lin Shaohua: He {{declared}} that men should avoid housework, as {{pots and pans}} are fatal to men. [...] "They wear out a man’s thinking and spirit—that’s the reason why there are effeminate men," [...] <b>and</b> thinks <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was totally right.|$|R
60|$|Ursula {{listened to}} this speech, her mind dumb <b>and</b> almost senseless, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was so {{unexpected}} and so untoward.|$|R
60|$|This {{conversation}} gave me {{food for}} reflection during a week. I was troubled about Mr. Swain, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> as to not living kept running {{in my head}} as I wrote or figured. For I had enough to hold me busy.|$|R
6000|$|OSWALD [...] Be not hasty, [...] For, sometimes, in despite of my conviction, [...] He tempted me {{to think}} the Story true; [...] 'Tis plain he loves the Maid, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> [...] That savoured of aversion to thy name [...] Appeared the genuine colour of his soul-- [...] Anxiety lest {{mischief}} should befal her [...] After his death.|$|E
60|$|In February, 1915, I met Judge Shields at Long Key, and, {{remembering his}} capture of this strange fish some years previous, I {{questioned}} him. He was singularly {{enthusiastic about the}} waahoo, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> excited my curiosity. Either the genial judge was obsessed or else this waahoo was a great fish. I was inclined to believe both, and then I forgot all about the matter.|$|E
60|$|And then, {{in answer}} to his questions, I told him briefly of all that had befallen me since that night in Paris when the wager had been laid, and of how, through the cunning silence of Chatellerault, I was now upon the very {{threshold}} of the scaffold. His wrath burst forth at that, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> of the Count did me good to hear. At last I stemmed his invective.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} {{afternoon}} on the same day, Billström officially apologized for his statement and said that his words {{came out in the}} wrong way, <b>and</b> that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was not <b>what</b> <b>he</b> really meant. Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Prime Minister of Sweden, welcomed Billströms apology.|$|R
5000|$|Shamsul Alam Khan Milon in {{his diary}} wrote the {{incident}} <b>and</b> recalled <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> before his death. Jehad said: I came to join the movement against autocracy but now I am dying without seeing its fall. My soul will rest in peace when the autocratic regime is ousted.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> this is <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> at last (his {{feelings}} matter not):-- [...] "I think we've {{tapped a}} private line. Hi! Threes about there! Trot!" ...|$|R
