40|$|Background: Physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes</b> {{have been}} {{identified}} as a potential strategy for improving social and emotional well-being in at-risk youth, who have a prevalence of depression and low self-esteem exceeding the general population. Methods: A systematic search of six electronic databases (EMBASE, OVID MEDLINE, PsychINFO, PubMed, Scopus and SPORTDiscus) was conducted to identify physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes</b> designed to improve social and emotional well-being in at-risk youth. Results: The search identified 15 studies, which reported the effects of three types of physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes</b> (i. e. outdoor adventure, sport and skill-based and physical fitness programmes) on social and emotional well-being. While many of the interventions resulted in significant positive effects, the risk of bias was high in all of the included studies. Conclusion: Due to the mixed findings and the high risk of bias, {{it is difficult to determine}} the efficacy of physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes</b> for improving social and emotional well being in at-risk youth...|$|R

40|$|Mapping {{exercise}} referral schemes in Lancashire Background: Physical {{activity is}} a key action point for {{the growing number of}} organisations interested in promoting public health. The increase in physical activity promotion is welcome but difficult to monitor. Whilst specific organisations such as Sport England have developed databases on sports clubs and sports programmes linked to their mission statement, there is fragmented and patchy evidence on physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes.</b> This {{is a result of the}} lack of a systematic approach to gathering data on “health related ” physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes.</b> In response a number of regions have commissioned audits and/or surveys of physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes.</b> Recently in 2006, in order to obtain a picture of health related physical activity in the 42 primary care trusts and 45 local authorities of North West region (6. 7 millio...|$|R

40|$|Physical {{activity}} {{can have a}} positive impact on cognition and well-being in older people. This article reviews and evaluates the effects of planned physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes</b> on mood, sleep and functional ability in people with dementia. A total of 27 studies between 1974 and 2005 were found. Of these, four included participants living at home, two involved participants who were living either at home or in care homes and 21 included participants living solely in care homes. Since psychosocial intervention can reduce family caregiver burden, the break down of home-care and associated rates of institutionalization, the indirect effects of these physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes</b> on the family caregiver are also explored. The scope for developing physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes</b> for people with dementia in primary care using families and volunteers is discussed. © 2006, Sage Publications.
