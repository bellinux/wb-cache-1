He helped popularize major poets such as Guido Cavalcanti and Du Fu, and brought Provençal and Chinese poetry to English-speaking audiences. He revived interest in the Confucian classics and introduced the west to classical Japanese poetry and drama. He translated and championed Greek, Latin and Anglo-Saxon classics, and helped keep them alive {{at a time when}} poets no longer considered translations central to their craft.|$|E

2500|$|Boulez {{gave various}} reasons for {{conducting}} {{as much as}} he did. He gave his first concerts for the Domaine Musical because its financial resources were limited: [...] "I told myself that, being much less expensive, I would have a go myself." [...] He also said that the best possible training for a composer was [...] "to have to play or conduct his own works and to face their difficulties of execution"—yet on a practical level he sometimes struggled to find time to compose around his conducting commitments. The writer and pianist Susan Bradshaw thought this was deliberate and related to a sense of being overshadowed as a composer by Stockhausen, who from the late 1950s was increasingly prolific. The French litterateur and musicologist Pierre Souvchinsky disagreed: [...] "Boulez became a conductor because he had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>gift</b> for it".|$|E
2500|$|The most {{valuable}} asset Butler commanded in New Orleans {{was not his}} army, but his formidable political heritage. Butler was a Jacksonian Democrat in all senses, and a populist and reformer. He had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>gift</b> for identifying with {{the issues of the}} broadest levels of the voters, and turning them to his political advantage. Here the Jacksonian political legacy had come full circle in 47 years, from defending New Orleans from the British, to securing it from secession. Butler's inscription on the base of Jackson’s statue, “The Union Must and Shall be Preserved”, was symbolic of his political identity. The inscription echoed Andrew Jackson's 1830 toast in response to a speech endorsing [...] "nullification", during what was called the Nullification Crisis. Jackson stated, [...] "Our Federal Union! It must be preserved!". This statement defined Jackson's position against any threat to the Union. The spoils system created by the Democratic party was also part of Butler’s political heritage. Butler believed the advantages of political office should be used to the advantage of friends and supporters, and to suppress political opponents. In general, Butler used these political abilities to play the various factions and interests in New Orleans as a virtuoso conductor would inspire an orchestra, to insure his control and reward Union supporters while isolating and marginalizing hostile pro-confederate factions.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{controversy}} surrounding the lake followed the {{proposal for a}} fountain to be erected in the lake {{to coincide with the}} city's Golden Jubilee anniversary celebrations in 1936. For the mayor, it would be [...] "a miracle of engineering," [...] with the spray of water lit by virtually [...] "limitless combinations" [...] of colour. The public, in contrast, were not impressed by the proposal. Its $33,019.96 price tag was considered extremely frivolous {{in the midst of an}} economic crisis. As written in The Sunday Sun Edition of the Vancouver Sun Newspaper, Saturday, August 8. 1936. The lead story in the Magazine section is; SECRETS OF THE FOUNTAIN. It was the conception and idea of then, Chief Electrical Engineer, Robert Harold Williams with Hume and Rumble Ltd. electrical contractors. R.Harold Williams designed and supervised the erection of the Vancouver's Golden Jubilee fountain. After a business trip to Los Angeles he saw a fountain and thought this would be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>gift</b> for the city for their up and coming birthday, Golden Jubilee celebration. To build the fountain, Lost Lagoon was drained. Seventy piles were driven into the mud. On these a concrete mat was laid. The fountain was built upon this mat. The work was of necessity rushed; it was done in a month. [...] "The fountain is worthy of all the traditions of art, worthy of Vancouver's Golden Jubilee, and it will be a permanent, decorative joy in Stanley Park". [...] "When operating , it is like a symphony concert, in motion and color instead of music, says Harold Williams, engineer, of Hume & Rumble Ltd., under whose personal supervision the work has been done." [...] Vancouver's Jubilee Committee and private citizens who contributed are to be commended on their work in pushing for this beautiful fountain, which is sure to be one of the major attractions during the Golden Jubilee celebration. [...] "We've had to hurry," [...] says Mr. Williams," [...] in that time 285 tons of cement have been utilized and all the special equipment was built." [...] All equipment was built in Canada and the pumps were constructed in Vancouver. All union labor was employed. It was restored for Expo in 1986.|$|E

5000|$|In 1742, {{after the}} death of his father, Duphly decided to move to Paris, where he {{abandoned}} playing the organ altogether and devoted himself to the harpsichord. He became famous as a performer and teacher. According to Louis-Claude Daquin: For some time he was organist at Rouen, but doubtless finding that he had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>gift</b> for the harpsichord, he abandoned his first instrument. One may suppose that he did well, for he passes in Paris for a very good harpsichordist. He has much lightness of touch and a certain softness, which, sustained by ornaments, marvelously render the character of his pieces. [...] According to Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg he devoted himself to the harpsichord in order not to spoil his hand with the organ.|$|R

Johnson unknowingly places the chief in his debt by giving him the stolen horses and scalps of the Blackfoot (their mortal enemies); according to Flathead custom, to maintain his honor the chief must now either kill him, or give him <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>gift.</b> The chief gives his daughter Swan to be Johnson's bride.
