5|$|These Sermons are curious; <b>and</b> <b>curious</b> {{for such}} reason as would make other works despicable. They {{were written in}} a {{careless}} hurrying manner; and were the offspring of necessity, not of choice: so that one will see the original force of the Dean's genius more in these compositions, that were the legitimate sons of duty, than in other pieces that were natural sons of love.|$|E
5|$|Ariel first {{appears in}} The Little Mermaid (1989), {{in which she}} is shown as being adventurous <b>and</b> <b>curious</b> about the world of humans, a fascination which angers both her father King Triton and his court {{composer}} Sebastian, as merfolk {{are not allowed to}} make contact with the human world. She and Flounder go in search of human objects, which they take to a seagull named Scuttle for appraisal. Ariel {{falls in love with a}} human prince named Prince Eric after saving him from drowning, and visits the sea witch, Ursula, who agrees to turn her into a human in exchange for her voice. Ariel must make Prince Eric fall in love with her and romantically kiss her within three days, lest she belong to Ursula forever.|$|E

5|$|Brian and Stewie {{decide to}} go to the North Pole to kill Santa, but Brian does not want Stewie to get {{disappointed}} if Santa is not what everybody thinks he is; to this Stewie responds that Brian is as negative as Eeyore from Winnie-the-Pooh. To prevent Stewie from going to the North Pole he tells him that Santa is not real; Stewie questions this, also asking if Elmo, SpongeBob SquarePants <b>and</b> <b>Curious</b> George aren't real. On their way to the North Pole, Brian and Stewie find themselves in Canada, where they meet a man with a thick Canadian accent; they also see the Aurora borealis and the Aurora Boreanaz (an aurora with David Boreanaz's face).|$|E
5|$|The best-known {{feature of}} the Church of Christ Pantocrator is the rich and {{colourful}} decoration of its exterior walls. The most lavishly decorated part {{of the church is}} the east side with the apse, and as a whole all sides of the church exhibit different ornamentation. Interchanging strips of three or four rows of bricks and carved stones, which create an optical pattern, are the most basic type of decoration used. Rows of blind arches, four-leaved floral motifs, triangular ornaments, circular turquoise ceramics and brick swastika friezes run along the east wall. Ousterhout likens the appearance of the church's superimposed arcades to an aqueduct; an earlier example of that configuration can be observed in the Cappadocian church of Çanlı Kilise near Aksaray, Turkey. The inclusion of swastikas in the decoration is considered unusual <b>and</b> <b>curious</b> to tourists. It is explained by the medieval use of the swastika {{as a symbol of the}} Sun.|$|E

25|$|C. molossus {{is often}} {{considered}} to be one the most docile rattlesnake ever, because of their placid <b>and</b> <b>curious</b> attitude. Bites rarely occur because of this.

25|$|Stingrays {{are usually}} very docile <b>and</b> <b>curious,</b> their usual {{reaction}} being to flee any disturbance, but they sometimes brush their fins past any new object they encounter.

25|$|In modern astrology, Mercury is {{regarded}} as the ruler of the third house; traditionally, it had the joy in the first house. Mercury is the messenger of the gods in mythology.

It is an opportunistic planet, decidedly unemotional <b>and</b> <b>curious.</b>|$|E
