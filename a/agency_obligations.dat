Such restrictions limit the borrower’s ability to access any accumulated equity. The predominant means of accessing this equity today is defeasance. By defeasing a loan, the borrower substitutes the commercial mortgage with U. S. Treasury or <b>agency</b> <b>obligations</b> whose payments match those of the defeased mortgage. Therefore, defeasance is an exchange option whereby the borrower gives up the portfolio of Treasury or agency securities and in return receives {{the market value of}} the commercial mortgage plus the liquidity benefits arising from accessing the accumulated equity in the underlying property. The value of the option to defease is shown to depend critically on the rate of return that can be earned on the released equity, prevailing interest rate conditions, as well as the option’s contractual features. 1...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} that the expressivity of ontology languages {{benefits from the}} introduction of non-standard modal operators beyond the usual existential restrictions and the number restrictions already featured by many description logics. Such operators serve to support notions such as uncertainty, defaults, <b>agency,</b> <b>obligation,</b> or evidence, which are hard to capture using only the standard operators, and whose semantics often goes beyond relational structures. We work in a unified theory for logics that combine non-standard modal operators and nominals, a feature of established description logics that provides the necessary means for reasoning about individuals; in particular, the logics of this framework allow for internalisation of ABoxes. We reenforce the general framework by proving decidability in EXPTIME of concept satisfiability over general TBoxes; moreover, we discuss example instantiations in various probabilistic logics with nominals. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "From fiscal years 2005 through 2010, civilian <b>agency</b> <b>obligations</b> on contracts for professional and management support services increased 44 percent, from $ 22 billion to $ 32 billion (in 2010 dollars), {{more than twice the}} rate of increase for other services. For the five agencies GAO reviewedthe Departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, the United States Agency for International Development, and the National Science Foundationmore than half of the 230 statements of work for professional and management support service contracts requested services that closely support the performance of inherently governmental functions. Using these services can inappropriately influence government decisionmaking if proper oversight is not provided. The five agencies generally did not consider and mitigate risks of acquiring professional and management support services prior to awarding the 12 contracts GAO reviewed. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires agencies to provide enhanced management oversight for contracts that closely support inherently governmental functions. For the 12 contracts, few of the officials said they considered whether contracted services included such functions. In some cases, officials said they later became concerned that contractors might perform inherently governmental functions or that government employees lacked expertise to oversee contracted work, and took steps to mitigate risks. Guidance from four of the five agencies did not include processes to identify risks or ensure enhanced management oversight when contractors perform such services. ...|$|E
40|$|Government {{agencies}} that develop infrastructure such as roads, waterworks, and energy delivery often impact natural ecosystems, {{but they also}} have unique opportunities to contribute to the conservation of regional natural resources through compensatory mitigation. Infrastructure development requires a planning, funding, and implementation cycle that can frequently take a decade or longer, but biological mitigation is often planned and implemented late in this process, in a project-by-project piecemeal manner. By adopting early regional mitigation needs assessment and planning for habitat-level impacts from multiple infrastructure projects, agencies could secure time needed to proactively integrate these obligations into regional conservation objectives. Such practice can be financially and ecologically beneficial due to economies of scale, and because earlier mitigation implementation means potentially developable critical parcels may still be available for conservation. Here, we compare the integration of regional conservation designs, termed greenprints, with early multi-project mitigation assessment for two areas in California, USA. The expected spatial extent of habitat impacts and associated mitigation requirements from multiple projects were identified for each area. We used the reserve-selection algorithm MARXAN to identify a regional greenprint for each site and to seek mitigation solutions through parcel acquisition that would contribute to the greenprint, as well as meet <b>agency</b> <b>obligations.</b> The two areas differed in the amount of input data available, the types of conservation objectives identified, and local land-management capacity. They are representative of the range of conditions that conservation practitioners may encounter, so contrasting the two illustrates how regional advanced mitigation can be generalized for use {{in a wide variety of}} settings. Environmental organizations can benefit from this approach because it provides a platform for collaboration with infrastructure agencies. Alone, infrastructure agency mitigation obligations will not satisfy all greenprint objectives, but they can be a major contributor to the ongoing process of implementing ecologically sustainable regional plans...|$|E

According to the Memorandum, this oversight model promotes {{the right to privacy}} by confirming the Ombudsman's ability to audit an agency’s use of its powers to access stored communications and telecommunications data under the TIA Act. This helps ensure an agency’s access to the telecommunications information of interest to an investigation, and the interaction with the privacy right under Article 17 in that regard is a reasonable, necessary and proportionate limitation on that right to privacy. Furthermore, a comprehensive oversight model ensures that use, access to or disclosure of telecommunications data is subject to independent compliance assessment.

Indonesian labour's taking place is held by the government and the Indonesian labour employment agency. Indonesian have a guarantee to be protected at the time before they taking place in abroad, at the time the working and at the time after finishing the work. One of the protection is they should get the safety and security shelter at the moment they back to Indonesian and countinue until the town or village they come from. Indonesian labour have to obey the job contract, the law and the tradition at the country they take place. If they break those law, they will get a law punishment. So they probably sent back to Indonesian because of their careless.
