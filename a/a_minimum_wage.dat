Among the laws he promoted, and the Assembly passed, were acts that banned {{the sale of}} narcotic drugs for the first time, <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage,</b> and free vaccinations for several prevalent diseases. Ralston successfully lobbied for other improvements to the living conditions of the urban poor that included funding to provide clean running water and children's playgrounds.|$|E

Government intervention, initiated by the later colonial governments and continued since 1997, has steadily increased, with the introduction of export credit guarantees, a compulsory pension scheme, <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage,</b> anti-discrimination laws, and a state mortgage backer.|$|E
5|$|In October 1893, a {{congress}} of miners {{was held in}} Grotte in the Province of Agrigento which was attended by some 1,500 people, including workers and small producers. The miners demanded that the minimum age to be raised to 14 years for those {{who worked in the}} sulfur mines, the decrease of working hours and setting <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage.</b> Small producers demanded measures to avoid exploitation by large owners. The minimum-age measure was meant to improve the situation for the carusi, minors that worked in conditions of near-slavery that sparked public outrage and inspired many complaints.|$|E

5|$|A case {{in which}} the Taft Court struck down {{regulation}} that generated a dissent from the chief justice was Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Congress had decreed <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> for women in the District of Columbia. A 5–3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down. Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the vote, meant that the sexes were equal when it came to bargaining power over working conditions; Taft, in dissent, deemed this unrealistic. Taft's dissent in Adkins was rare both because he authored few dissents, and because {{it was one of the}} few times he took an expansive view of the police power of the government.|$|E
5|$|Nasser also {{attempted}} to maintain {{oversight of the}} country's civil service {{to prevent it from}} inflating and consequently becoming a burden to the state. New laws provided workers with <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage,</b> profit shares, free education, free health care, reduced working hours, and encouragement to participate in management. Land reforms guaranteed the security of tenant farmers, promoted agricultural growth, and reduced rural poverty. As a result of the 1962 measures, government ownership of Egyptian business reached 51percent, and the National Union was renamed the Arab Socialist Union (ASU). With these measures came more domestic repression, as thousands of Islamists were imprisoned, including dozens of military officers. Nasser's tilt toward a Soviet-style system led his aides Boghdadi and Hussein el-Shafei to submit their resignations in protest.|$|E

It is {{known as one of the}} Four Asian Tigers for its high growth rates and rapid development from the 1960s to the 1990s. Between 1961 and 1997 Hong Kong's gross domestic product grew 180 times while per-capita GDP increased 87 times over. In 2008, the territory was named as a Nylonkong global metropolis and financial centre.|$|E
40|$|We {{explore how}} {{the effects of}} the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) are {{influenced}} by the level of the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage.</b> Our results indicate that the EITC boosts employment and earnings for single women with children, and coupling the EITC with <b>a</b> higher <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> enhances this positive effect. In contrast, employment and earnings of less-skilled minority men and women without children are more adversely affected by the EITC when the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> is higher. At the family level, <b>a</b> higher <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> increases the poverty-reducing effects of the EITC for families with children; in that sense, <b>a</b> higher <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> does appear to enhance {{the effects of the}} EITC.

5|$|The bids {{from private}} {{companies}} were {{heavily influenced by}} the legislation of the New Deal. The Vinson-Trammell Act limited profit from a ship's construction to 10percent, while the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act specified <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> and required working conditions for workers. The latter act greatly affected {{the ability of the}} navy to acquire steel, as the text of the law caused friction between executives in the industry, who greatly disliked the forty-hour work week and minimum wage requirements, and their workers—who themselves were embroiled in a separate dispute pitting the union of the skilled workers, the American Federation of Labor, against the union of the unskilled, the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Amid the unrest, the navy ran into difficulties trying to acquire 18million pounds of steel to build six destroyers and three submarines; many more pounds than this would be needed for the new battleships.|$|E
5|$|The repressive {{policies}} of the Ubico government resulted in a popular uprising led by university students and middle-class citizens in 1944. Ubico fled, handing over power to a three-person junta which continued Ubico's policies until it too was toppled, by the October Revolution that aimed to transform Guatemala into a liberal democracy. The largely free election that followed installed a philosophically conservative university professor, Juan José Arévalo, as the President of Guatemala. Arévalo's administration drafted a more liberal labor code, built health centers, and increased funding to education. Arévalo enacted <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage,</b> and created state-run farms to employ landless laborers. He also cracked down on the communist Guatemalan Party of Labour (Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo, PGT) and in 1945 criminalized all labor unions in workplaces with fewer than 500 workers. By 1947, the remaining unions had grown strong enough to pressure him into drafting a new labor code, which made workplace discrimination illegal and created health and safety standards. However, Arévalo refused to advocate land reform of any kind, and stopped short of drastically changing labor relations in the countryside.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, after {{retiring}} from her NUGMW post, Bondfield founded the Women's Group on Public Welfare. She studied labour {{conditions in the}} United States and Mexico during 1938, and toured the US and Canada after the outbreak of war in 1939, as a lecturer for the British Information Services. Her attitude towards the war was different from her semi-pacifist stance of 1914; she actively supported the government and, in 1941, published a booklet, Why Labour Fights. Her main wartime activity was leading {{an investigation by the}} Hygiene Committee of the Women's Group on Public Welfare, into the problems that arose from the large-scale evacuation into the countryside of city children. The group's findings were published in 1943, as Our Towns: a Close-up; the report gave many people their first understanding of the extent of inner-city poverty. Suggested solutions included nursery education, <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage,</b> child allowances and a national health service. The report was reprinted several times, and was instrumental in developing support for the social reforms introduced by the Labour government that took office in 1945. Among Bondfield's other wartime activities, in 1944 she helped to launch a national drive for the appointment of more women police officers.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} the 1890s that the first modern {{legislative}} attempts to regulate minimum wages were seen in New Zealand and Australia. The movement for <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> was initially focused on stopping sweatshop labor and controlling the proliferation of sweatshops in manufacturing industries. The sweatshops employed large numbers of women and young workers, paying them what were considered to be substandard wages. The sweatshop owners were thought to have unfair bargaining power over their employees, and <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> was proposed as a means to make them pay fairly.

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> is {{the lowest}} {{remuneration}} that employers can legally pay their workers. Equivalently, it is the price floor below which workers may not sell their labor. Although minimum wage laws are in effect in many jurisdictions, differences of opinion exist about the benefits and drawbacks of <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage.</b> Supporters of the minimum wage say it increases {{the standard of living}} of workers, reduces poverty, reduces inequality, and boosts morale. In contrast, opponents of the minimum wage say it increases poverty, increases unemployment (particularly among unskilled or inexperienced workers) and is damaging to businesses, because excessively high minimum wages require businesses to raise the prices of their product or service to accommodate the extra expense of paying a higher wage.|$|E

30|$|An {{important}} policy {{implication of}} this study is that <b>a</b> federal <b>minimum</b> wage—besides its potential negative employment effects—would influence the effectiveness of existing and alternative types of wage subsidies in the low-wage sector. Under <b>a</b> binding federal <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> employee-oriented wage subsidies would not be an effective instrument to raise employment in the low-pay sector. On the contrary, a wage subsidy targeted at employers is able to compensate higher wage costs induced by <b>a</b> statutory <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> and thus to secure employment in low-wage labor markets. This is an effective policy instrument in several EU countries. Negative employment effects of <b>a</b> federal <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> can be reduced by a degressive wage subsidy targeted at employers since they help to reduce an employer’s social security contribution. These results also confirm that <b>a</b> statutory <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> is not <b>an</b> appropriate policy instrument to secure employment in low-wage labor markets. Employer-oriented wage subsidies are preferable from an employment perspective.|$|R
