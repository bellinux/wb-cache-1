5|$|In 1905, Procter & Gamble {{opened a}} large plant near Arlington Yard, later called Port Ivory, {{resulting}} in <b>additional</b> <b>traffic.</b> The line's electrification project was completed on Christmas Day of 1925, cutting ten minutes off of travel time from Arlington to Saint George.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, the Department of Transportation {{looked into}} the {{expansion}} of NY347 and NY454. The studies suggested that the state would add one <b>additional</b> <b>traffic</b> lane in each direction, giving most of the highway six lanes with eight travel lanes along the concurrency in Hauppauge. The new lanes would also be capable of holding rapid-commute vehicles for the Long Island Rapid Commute. The interchange where Routes 347 and 454 fork in Hauppague is slated to go from an at-grade fork to a grade-separated interchange. The project, which will cost $359 million (2009 USD) {{was scheduled to be}} completed between 2012 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|If {{the federal}} {{property}} is an enclave, then {{the federal government}} has exclusive jurisdiction, unless the state reserved rights when it ceded the land to the federal government. The Assimilative Crimes Act makes it a federal crime to violate a state law while at a federal enclave in that state. The Assimilative Crimes Act only applies to criminal laws (not regulatory laws), and is not applicable if the conduct is already regulated by federal law. Under federal law, military facilities are required to adopt state traffic laws, but the base commander is permitted to institute <b>additional</b> <b>traffic</b> laws.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} the GPK was authorised, {{controversy}} raged about the route a railway to England might take. It was plain that Carlisle would be reached from the south; a direct route from Glasgow over the Southern Uplands, the route that {{became known as the}} Annandale line, would involve severe gradients, and pass through almost unpopulated territory. The locomotives available at the time were not thought to be capable of climbing the steep inclines, and rope haulage was put forward by some as the solution. By contrast, a route from Kilmarnock through Cumnock and Dumfries—the Nithsdale line—would have much easier gradients and pass through considerable population centres, bringing in <b>additional</b> <b>traffic.</b> Moreover, the Nithsdale route would be much cheaper to build.|$|E
5|$|The first mall to {{be opened}} in College Station, Post Oak is the largest mall within the Brazos Valley area. At its opening, it became the city's largest employer, and nearly doubled its city sales tax revenues. Though the mall {{generated}} <b>additional</b> <b>traffic</b> and added to the demand on city services, it also generated $1 million in annual sales tax revenue, $120,000 in property taxes, and a half-million in taxes for the city school district. It is credited with creating the first major impetus for growing economic and commercial developments for College Station, which previously lacked a major retail community. The mall generates over 75 percent of the area's retail sales through its approximately eleven million annual visitors. It remains the city's largest taxpayer and its second largest employer. It is also the top employer of the students of nearby Texas A University.|$|E
5|$|Before the Dumbarton and San Mateo-Hayward Bridges {{were built}} across the San Francisco Bay in the 1920s, San Francisco was bottled {{up at the}} north end of a long peninsula, with driving south on El Camino Real towards San Jose as the only {{reasonable}} alternative to the ferries for crossing the bay. The first of several highways built as an alternate to El Camino Real was the Skyline Boulevard, which was added to the state highway system in 1919. A second route, the Bay Shore Highway (Route 68), became a state highway in 1923, but only from the San Francisco city limits into San Mateo County, where the Dumbarton Bridge would begin. Just prior to the start of construction on the Dumbarton Bridge, San Francisco Supervisor Richard J. Welch noted that the Bay Shore Highway would need to be built all the way to San Jose as an escape valve for the <b>additional</b> <b>traffic</b> that the bridge would attract.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{intracellular}} {{routes of}} sphingolipid trafficking {{are related to}} the compartmentalized nature of sphingolipid metabolism, with synthesis beginning in the endoplasmic reticulum, continuing in the Golgi apparatus, and degradation occurring mainly in lysosomes. Whereas bulk sphingolipid transport between subcellular organelles occurs primarily via vesicle-mediated pathways, evidence is accumulating that sphingolipids are found in subcellular organelles that are not connected to each other by vesicular flow, implying <b>additional</b> <b>trafficking</b> routes. After discussing how sphingolipids are transported through the secretory pathway, I will review evidence for sphingolipid metabolism in organelles such as the mitochondria, and then discuss how this impacts upon our current understanding of the regulation of intracellular sphingolipid transport...|$|R

25|$|It is {{proposed}} that the Hiawatha Service, along with the Empire Builder would shift one stop north to North Glenview in Glenview, Illinois. This move would eliminate lengthy stops which block traffic on Glenview Road. This move would involve reconstruction of the North Glenview station to handle the <b>additional</b> <b>traffic,</b> and depends on commitments from Glenview, the Illinois General Assembly and Metra.|$|E
25|$|The Corps {{estimated}} the New Orleans area {{was more than}} 80 percent unwatered. Corps officials {{estimated the}} overall unwatering effort, given normal seasonal rainfall, would be completed no later than early October, 2005. Tropical Storm Rita was being closely watched at this point. <b>Additional</b> <b>traffic</b> in {{the city in the}} past three days had caused some delay in traveling to work sites and moving emergency repair equipment.|$|E
25|$|This <b>additional</b> <b>traffic</b> {{required}} substantial {{improvements to}} infrastructure, notably at Newhaven harbour, where electric lighting was installed, and at Three Bridges, where a new goods marshalling yard was established, and at Gatwick and Haywards Heath, where loops were constructed {{so that the}} frequent passenger trains would not be impeded by slower goods trains. Some munitions trains were routed to Newhaven via the Steyning Line to Brighton to avoid congesting {{the part of the}} Brighton main line which had only two tracks.|$|E

25|$|The first {{expansion}} {{would come}} the following year. Construction {{of the line}} to Ugla had started, and was opened on 30 May 1925. To create <b>additional</b> <b>traffic,</b> two of the board members established their own company to build a tavern at Ugla. The rebuilding of the Ugla Farm included a small zoo with various aquatic birds and a hare. Part of the tavern was rebuilt to become a concert hall, and an electric organ was installed. Graakalbanen gave support to the tavern per sold ticket, and up to 5,000 people would travel to the tavern on sunny summer weekends.|$|E
25|$|In 1863 an {{independent}} branch line was opened to Dumfries, the Dumfries, Lochmaben and Lockerbie Railway was opened. The Caledonian acquired {{the line in}} 1865. The Portpatrick Railway had opened in 1861-1862 and the Caledonian worked it. This gave it access from Lockerbie to Stranraer and Portpatrick, enabling it to develop ferry services {{to the north of}} Ireland. It routed traffic from there to Glasgow and Edinburgh via Lockerbie, bringing considerable <b>additional</b> <b>traffic</b> to the main line. When the Portpatrick Railway was reconstituted into the Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Joint Railway, the Caledonian was a one-quarter owner.|$|E
25|$|An Act of Parliament of 1862 {{gave the}} LB power {{to enlarge the}} station further. Over {{the next few years}} under the {{direction}} of new Chief Engineer Frederick Banister, the company built four more platform-faces in an adjoining area to the south of its existing station to cope with <b>additional</b> <b>traffic</b> generated by the completion of the South London Line and other suburban lines to Victoria station. This had a single-span trussed-arch roof measuring , and was designed by J. Hawkshaw and Banister. During {{the first decade of the}} twentieth century LB station at London Bridge was again enlarged, but overall London Bridge station remained a sprawling confusion.|$|E
40|$|The exocyst {{complex is}} an {{evolutionarily}} conserved multisubunit protein complex implicated in tethering secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane. Originally identified {{two decades ago}} in budding yeast, investigations using several different eukaryotic systems have since made great progress toward determination of the overall structure and organization of the eight exocyst subunits. Studies point to a critical role for the complex as a spatiotemporal regulator through the numerous protein and lipid interactions of its subunits, although a molecular understanding of exocyst function has been challenging to elucidate. Recent progress demonstrates that the exocyst is also important for <b>additional</b> <b>trafficking</b> steps and cellular processes beyond exocytosis, with links to development and disease. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of exocyst architecture, assembly, regulation and its roles {{in a variety of}} cellular trafficking pathways...|$|R

25|$|Formerly 47S. In 2005, the Port Authority {{opened a}} new parking garage at the South Hills Village station. The 47S line was {{established}} {{in an effort to}} relieve congestion on the Red Line for the <b>additional</b> <b>traffic</b> that the parking garage created. The Blue Line - South Hills Village route follows the South Hills Village leg of the Red Line and the common leg from Washington Junction to Willow Station, which is adjacent to Overbrook Junction, where it switches to the Blue Line - Library mainline. It follows the Blue Line - Library to South Hills Junction where it reunites with the Red Line before entering downtown.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} Croydon Vision 2020 {{regeneration}} scheme, East Croydon {{is planned}} to be expanded to both {{the west and the}} east. Work has been planned on the west side for some time to increase station capacity, made more urgent by likely <b>additional</b> <b>traffic</b> from the planned Croydon Gateway nearby. A proposal by Arrowcroft, which included the 12,500-seat Croydon Arena, was rejected in August 2008. Arrowcroft had proposed a £24million expansion of the station with a new 'airport style' concourse above the tracks {{to the north of the}} station. Arrowcroft had agreed to contribute £500,000 to the build costs to offset the impact of their proposed Arena. The source of the remaining £23.5million was not identified, and Network Rail had not committed this expenditure in its capital plans.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1930s, the Company {{considered}} enlarging the navigation above Nottingham, {{in conjunction with}} improvements to the River Soar Navigation, between Trent Lock and Leicester. There were also negotiations with the London and North Eastern Railway, who {{were responsible for the}} Nottingham Canal between Trent Lock and Lenton. Plans for new larger locks at Beeston and Wilford were abandoned when the Trent Catchment Board opposed them. The Grand Union refused to improve the Soar Navigation, because the Trent Navigation Company could not guarantee 135,000 tons of <b>additional</b> <b>traffic.</b> The Company also considered a plan to reopen the river to Burton, which would have involved the rebuilding of Kings Mills lock, and the construction of four new locks. An extra set of gates were added to Cromwell lock in 1935, effectively creating a second lock, while the Lenton to Trent Lock section was leased from the LNER in 1936, and ultimately purchased in 1946.|$|E
50|$|An {{additional}} platform at the terminus station (known as {{the third}} class platform) was opened in 1885 to cope with <b>additional</b> raceday <b>traffic.</b> Opening {{the same year as}} Newmarket Warren Hill station the old station site dealt with race traffic from the south and London whilst Warren Hill dealt with traffic from the north and east.|$|R
