5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> lined up on the grid per FIA race procedure. As Charlie Whiting signalled the green light to start the {{formation}} lap, a full field of twenty cars set off as normal for a single lap before forming the starting grid. At the banked Turn 13, the entrance to the pit lane (and the turn that was the centre of the controversy), all teams that ran Michelin tyres returned to their pits, leaving just six cars from the three Bridgestone teams (Ferrari, Jordan, and Minardi) to start the race.|$|E
5|$|FIAT driver Aldo Weilschott {{climbed from}} fourteenth on lap three to third on lap five, before his car {{rolled off the}} planks outside Vibraye. Szisz {{maintained}} the lead he had gained on lap three to finish the first day just before noon {{in a time of}} 5hours, 45minutes and 30.4seconds (5:45:30.4), 26minutes ahead of Albert Clément of Clément-Bayard. Despite a slow start, FIAT driver Felice Nazzaro moved up to third position, 15minutes behind Clément. Seventeen cars completed the first day; Henri Rougier's Lorraine-Dietrich finished last with a time of 8:15:55.0, two-and-a-half-hours behind Szisz. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> that were competing the next day were moved into parc fermé, a floodlit area guarded overnight by members of the ACF, to prevent teams and drivers from working on them until the following morning.|$|E
5|$|Narrowly escaping, Mike and Debbie {{travel to}} the police station to report the {{incident}} to Debbie's ex-boyfriend, Deputy Dave Hanson (John Allen Nelson), and his curmudgeonly partner, Deputy Curtis Mooney (John Vernon). The skeptical Mooney believes the story to be a hoax. After taking Debbie home, Mike and Dave return to the woods, only to find the circus tent has vanished, leaving a large crater in its place. They then {{travel to the}} lovers' lane, only to find <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> abandoned and covered in a cotton candy-like substance. Back in town, the klowns arrive and begin capturing townspeople in cocoons using rayguns that resemble toys. Several klowns perform pranks and mock circus acts, all resulting in the deaths of several onlookers.|$|E

5|$|Tiffany reneges on her deal to meet {{back with}} Bond and instead flees, passing off the {{diamonds}} {{to the next}} smuggler. However, seeing that O'Toole was killed after being mistaken for her, Tiffany changes her mind. She drives Bond to the airport, where the diamonds are given to Whyte's casino manager, Bert Saxby, who is followed to a remote facility. Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds: a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where a satellite is being built by Professor Metz, a laser refraction specialist. Bond fakes Metz by telling him he is Klaus Hergersheimer, a technician he met in the facility. His cover is blown when the real Hergersheimer shows up. Bond attempts to remain hidden, but is seen by a technician. He manages to evade the security guards by stealing a moon buggy and reunites with Tiffany. The laboratory report Bond's activity to the sheriff's office. Bond and Tiffany make {{their way back to}} Las Vegas; they are seen there by the Las Vegas police, who engage in a car chase, but Bond manages to evade <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|E
25|$|By 1918, half of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> in the US were Model Ts.

25|$|Approximately {{three hours}} before the {{scheduled}} race start it was announced Nick Heidfeld would be starting the race from the pitlane, after his team discovered insufficient ballast had been fitted to his car.

The remaining Toro Rosso of Vitantonio Liuzzi suffered similar hydraulic problems to those befell him in qualifying.|$|E
25|$|The Z1 was {{produced}} from March 1989 to June 1991, and 8,000 cars were produced. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> were left-hand drive, {{and the majority}} (6,443) were sold in BMW's native German market. The country to receive the second-greatest number of Z1s, Italy, received less than 7% of the total sold domestically.

After outcry from the lessees and activists in the US and Norway, Ford returned the cars to Norway for sale. 440 units were leased in the U.S. from 1999 until 2003.|$|E
25|$|Following a late race safety-car intervention, Perkins (who {{had just}} {{returned}} to the car), found himself in sixth place, and only about 10 seconds behind the leader, Glenn Seton. Following the exit of the safety car, Perkins picked off <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> ahead of him {{over the next three}} laps, with the exception of Seton, who had responded to Larry's charge, and started turning similar lap times. Seton seemed set for victory.|$|E
25|$|Since the 202 {{never made}} large scale {{production}} and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> were handmade, the small talented group at Cisitalia, including Carlo Abarth, Dante Giacosa and Giovanni Savonuzzi, made several variants of the 202. Of {{the more important}} versions, the SMM Nuvolari Spider was built and named after a class victory at the 1947 Mille Miglia by famed driver Tazio Nuvolari. It is easily identified by its large rear fins, twin windscreens and usual Italian blood red paint scheme.|$|E

25|$|A {{ratio is}} often {{converted}} to a fraction when it is expressed as a ratio to the whole. In the above example, the ratio of yellow cars to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> on the lot is 4:12 or 1:3. We can convert these ratios to a fraction and say that 4/12 of the cars or ⅓ of the cars in the lot are yellow. Therefore, if a person randomly chose one car on the lot, {{then there is a}} one in three chance or probability that it would be yellow.|$|E
25|$|Competing {{with the}} F110, the Hispania team scored no points, with a best {{classified}} finish of 14th achieved on three occasions: Chandhok at the Australian and Monaco Grands Prix, and Senna at the Korean Grand Prix. The team's best qualifying performance was Senna's 18thposition {{on the grid}} at the Belgian Grand Prix, but the F110 had the worst qualifying record of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> that competed in the 2010 season: of the 27drivers who took part, Senna, Yamamoto, Klien and Chandhok had the lowest average grid position overall (in that order). Nevertheless, the team finished ahead of Virgin in the World Constructors' Championship due to a better finishing record: Glock and Di Grassi only managed two 14th-place finishes between them compared to the Hispania drivers' three.|$|E
25|$|After {{overnight}} {{track work}} to fix {{problems with the}} track at turn 10, the race started with Hamilton holding his lead and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> making it through the first corner. Hamilton built up a lead of over 5 seconds over Robert Kubica before Adrian Sutil had a gearbox failure on the 16th lap and parked his car after turn 3. Sutil's car was off the track but after it caught fire the safety car was brought out, {{and there was a}} rush of drivers into the pits as all of the six lead drivers went in for their pit stops. Hamilton led Räikkönen and Kubica into the pitlane but Räikkönen took the lead as they left their garages, with Kubica alongside him and Hamilton behind.|$|E

25|$|Italian racing class Formula Abarth {{introduced}} the Tatuus FA010 {{powered by a}} 1.4L Fiat-FPT engine. The car was later introduced in the Formula Masters China (2011), Panam GP Series (2012), Formula Russia (2013). Starting in 2014 the Florida Winter Series, {{set up by the}} Ferrari Driver Academy, will use an updated version of the Tatuus FA010. For 2014 Tatuus was contracted to build <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> for the Formula 4 Italian Championship, a new class under the rules of the FIA Formula 4. The Tatuus F4-T014 is powered by a detuned Formula Abarth engine, limited to 160hp. In 2015, the new ADAC Formula 4 adopted the Tatuus car. The BRDC Formula 4 Championship announced in September 2014 that it would use a Tatuus chassis from the 2015 BRDC Formula 4 Autumn Trophy.|$|E
25|$|In late 2003, General Motors, {{then led}} by CEO Rick Wagoner, officially {{canceled}} the EV1 program. GM {{stated that it}} could not sell enough of the cars to make the EV1 profitable. In addition, the cost of maintaining a parts supply and service infrastructure for the 15-year minimum required by the state of California meant that existing leases would not be renewed, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> would have to be returned to GM's possession. At least 58 EV1 drivers sent letters and deposit checks to GM, requesting lease extensions at no risk or cost to the automaker. The drivers reportedly agreed to be responsible for the maintenance and repair costs of the EV1, and would allow GM the right to terminate the lease if expensive repairs were needed. On June 28, GM famously refused the offer and returned the checks, which totaled $22,000; By contrast, Honda, which had taken similar actions with its EV+ program, agreed to extend its customers' leases.|$|E
25|$|Almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> were {{delivered}} with a two-class layout. A 12-seat first class saloon was {{located at the}} cab end of the car, a glazed partition behind the cab permitting forward (or rearward) views through the windscreen. A 32-seat second class (known as third class until 1956) saloon was positioned towards the gangway end, {{and there was also}} a guard's compartment and, in cars 2600–2647, a toilet. Cars 2648–2657 were intended for suburban use and devoid of toilets, permitting an extra four second class seats; apart from a lack of tables, they were otherwise identical to cars intended for longer-distance service. However, odd-numbered cars in this series subsequently had their guard's compartments removed to provide additional seating. Exceptionally, two cars (2658–2659) for use on the Waterford and Tramore Railway {{were delivered}} with high-density, single-class (although still divided into two saloons) layouts without toilets; the guard's compartment was also omitted from one car. Special trailer cars (see above) with similar high-density layouts operated with them. Most other cars were refitted with high-density, single-class layouts in the 1960s and early 1970s; these layouts seated between 70 and 91, depending on whether the toilet, guard's compartment or both were retained.|$|E
