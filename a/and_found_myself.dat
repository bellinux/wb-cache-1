25|$|Simpson now {{announced}} that his target {{would be a}} run a minute, an ordinary rate maybe in days gone, but a breakneck almost in the sixties, what with slow over-rates and so much accent on defence. Yet Australia, {{give or take a}} few minutes, achieved it, their captain leading the way with the highest opening stand ever, in a partnership with Lawry, for Australia against England: 244. I never remember seeing better running between wickets than of these two â€“ <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> comparing them, in fact, with Hobbs and Sutcliffe. With the field constantly changing over as right- and left-hander alternated, England, in much heat, sweated and chased unavailingly.|$|E
500|$|March 1968, at a jam at the Scene club in New York City, later {{released}} on Woke Up This Morning <b>and</b> <b>Found</b> <b>Myself</b> Dead. [...] Unlike his other versions, Hendrix used a guitar figure similar to Cream's [...] "Crossroads".|$|E
500|$|While {{delivering}} an elkhorn {{chair to}} President Buchanan in 1857, Kinman said, [...] "l awoke one fine morning <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> famous." [...] He {{made use of}} this fame starting {{in the summer of}} 1861, together with ventriloquist and magician J. G. Kenyon, by opening an exhibit, first in Eureka and then in San Francisco in August of that same year. Kinman displayed his [...] "curiosities" [...] including an elkhorn chair, mounted grizzly bears, several fiddles, and scalps, and gave a lecture.|$|E
60|$|He {{said this}} between clenched teeth, always an unmatey thing to do, <b>and</b> I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> more fogged than ever.|$|R
60|$|And so, my dear grandsons, {{the great}} {{resolution}} was taken, <b>and</b> I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> committed {{to one side}} in the national quarrel.|$|R
60|$|They rose up {{together}} with a prolonged rustling as of a peacock displaying his plumes; <b>and</b> I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> irretrievably their captive.|$|R
500|$|Noel Murray of The A.V. Club was {{generally}} {{favorable to the}} episode, giving it a B+. He wrote, [...] "Much like Fringe fan favorite 'The Arrival' (not a favorite of mine, sorry to say), 'The Dreamscape' is an episode more involved with insinuation and mythology-building than with telling a complete-in-one story. But perhaps because I've come to trust Fringe more over its recent run of entertaining episodes, I enjoyed it fairly well, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> {{trying to figure out}} what kind of thematic connections I could make using the notion of the body reacting to mere thoughts." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 7.8/10, explaining that it [...] "certainly moves in the right direction". Fickett found the [...] "coolest moment" [...] to be when Olivia witnesses John Scott's memory, and he also appreciated Peter's backstory ("It's more than Peter usually gets, but what we know isn't much and isn't very exciting."). Fickett criticized Olivia however for leaving the man at the hospital unsuitably protected.|$|E
2500|$|Meghnad Badh Kavya, The Slaying of Meghnad, {{the story}} of the final fight and demise of Meghnad, the eldest son of Ravana, is {{unanimously}} hailed as his magnum opus, although his journey to publication and recognition was far from smooth. However, with its publication, he distinguished himself as a serious composer of an entirely new genre of heroic poetry, that was Homeric and Dantesque in technique and style, and yet so fundamentally native in theme. To cite the poet himself: [...] "I awoke one morning <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> famous." [...] Nevertheless, it took a few years for this epic to win recognition all over the country.|$|E
2500|$|Frontman James Veck-Gilodi {{has spoken}} {{at length about}} the themes of each song on the album, {{describing}} them as 'very personal and each is a small story that depicts {{a part of my}} life'. Much of the album is about nostalgia, underachievement and anxiety, which are all topics which are personal to him as he wrote all the lyrics for the album. The opening track [...] "The Past Six Years", from whose lyrics the album takes its title, is described as 'an ode to... not really achieving as much as we'd have liked'. The lyrics make reference to friends and fellow bands Lower Than Atlantis and Young Guns and how James feels 'a perpetual bitterness and jealousy towards them in terms of their achievements, {{despite the fact that they}} are close friends'. [...] "I'm a Bore, Mostly" [...] also deals with the topic of underachievement, with James explaining that the song is about 'the mundane daily routine I had when I was living in London. ...I couldn't deal with city life, I rarely left the house <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> sinking into this terrible routine. I didn't really appreciate anything at the time and I had no enthusiasm'. He has claimed he wrote the song [...] "Filthy Rotten Scoundrel" [...] about himself; 'I need to learn to be grateful and appreciate the opportunities that I have been given. It's also about my fear of living, dying and never really achieving anything'. [...] "The World or Nothing" [...] continues this trend, with James describing the theme as 'the vicious cycle of feeling lost and resorting to the aid of alcohol while also feeling lost because of alcohol. It talks about how self-destructive a lot of us are and how we enjoy abusing our bodies'. Of [...] "Nelson's County", Veck-Gilodi has said: 'This song is about the county of Norfolk and how a lot of the people who reside there seem to have no real ambition other than working a 9-5, raising a family and living a normal life'.|$|E
60|$|I yielded {{myself to}} the guiding hand, <b>and</b> shortly <b>found</b> <b>myself,</b> so far as I could see, at {{one side of the}} sanctuary.|$|R
5000|$|... "soon after, as I sat {{one night}} {{by the kitchen}} fire, the Spirit of the Lord came on me <b>and</b> I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> {{suddenly}} weeping aloud and confessing my sins to God in detail, as I could recall them, and begged Him for Jesus' sake to forgive them, with all I could not remember; <b>and</b> I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> trusting in Jesus that {{it would all be}} so, and in a few minutes my heart was filled with peace and love, not the shadow of a doubt remaining." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} 'Not at all!' and Traddles answered 'Not at all!' <b>and</b> I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> afterwards sagely adding, alone, that {{a person}} must either live or die.|$|R
60|$|I turned round, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> face to {{face with}} Ezra Jennings.|$|E
60|$|I stammered {{some kind}} of thanks, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> going out and down-stairs with my friends.|$|E
6000|$|Reaching {{the second}} floor by two stairs at a time, I burst into Mr. Keller's bedroom, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> face to face with--Madame Fontaine! ...|$|E
60|$|At last I {{released}} her, {{when she}} had begged me again. <b>And</b> I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> a little later walking past the familiar, empty houses of those streets....|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} trusty and friendly in his voice; <b>and</b> I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> gripping hands with him, in that hard, short shake that means {{so much with}} English-speaking people.|$|R
60|$|I obeyed her {{instructions}} <b>and</b> presently <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> with my {{head over}} the basin, staring into {{the water in the}} exact attitude of a person who is about to be shampooed.|$|R
60|$|The servant {{led me to}} {{the room}} which the Countess had just left. I entered it, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> {{face to face with the}} Count.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked up}} <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> nigh Eliot's pulpit, {{at the base}} of which sat Hollingsworth, with Priscilla at his feet and Zenobia {{standing}} before them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Every bit of it, my love," [...] said I: so I {{gave it a}} twist or two, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> at Almack's. The {{rooms were}} crowded to suffocation.|$|E
6000|$|... "That woke me up, <b>and</b> I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> {{in one of}} the passageways not {{far from}} here. I was dazed by the tumble I received, but got back here all right." ...|$|R
60|$|This from George, <b>and</b> I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> {{looking into}} the muzzle of his {{revolver}}--of the revolver he dared to use on me, but was too cowardly to use on the prisoners.|$|R
5000|$|In 2017, Valo {{revisited}} Love Metal {{and declared}} {{it as the}} band's best album, stating: [...] "We found {{the sound of the}} band, <b>and</b> I <b>found</b> <b>myself.</b> The band's declaration of what we are." ...|$|R
60|$|But this remark, I grieve to state, Came just {{a little}} bit too late For as I framed it in my head, I woke <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> in bed.|$|E
60|$|I {{should not}} be {{surprised}} at this; but I was surprised the other day at something more surprising. I took a turn out of Fleet Street <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> in England.|$|E
60|$|I turned, wondering, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> face to {{face with}} my foster-nurse, Atoua. She knew me instantly, for I saw her start, but in the {{presence}} of the people she checked her surprise.|$|E
60|$|Crowding all sail, we braced {{the yards}} square; and, the breeze freshening, bowled {{straight}} {{away from the}} land. Once more the sailor's cradle rocked under me, <b>and</b> I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> rolling in my gait.|$|R
60|$|I felt my arm seized {{above the}} elbow, <b>and</b> next instant <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> swung {{so as to}} face Mr. Razumov.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{we entered}} the door, he barred it, <b>and</b> I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> {{in the face of}} another huge door, which was {{strongly}} locked; and, at last, passing through that, we entered the lobby of the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "On my word, my Lord Chandos," [...] said Eustace, {{colouring}} deeply, [...] "I am no loiterer here; I came but to seek my Squire, Leonard Ashton, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> {{entangled in}} the crowd." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I went <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> face to face, {{not with}} 'missis,' {{but the woman}} I had loved hopelessly but {{faithfully}} all that hard year, since I had gone away to fight my battle alone.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{there was}} a touch at my elbow. I turned, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> looking into the humorous, masterful eyes of the tall, thin man who had volunteered to be my {{companion}} on this strange quest.|$|E
5000|$|... "He {{called his}} friends <b>and</b> I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> working almost immediately. I started to sing everywhere. It was barely {{three weeks after}} my arrival that I was signed with Carla Music to record a disco album {{entitled}} Black Orchid." ...|$|R
60|$|Not to {{be caught}} in this manner I sprang aside, and retreated rapidly towards the stern of the schooner. I did not know {{anything}} about the vessel, <b>and</b> finally <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> near the cabin, and face to face with Captain Hannock.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{threw my}} whole weight against my bedroom {{door in the}} hope of forcing the lock. It stood firm for a while, but I flung myself upon it again and again, until {{something}} snapped <b>and</b> I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> in the passage.|$|R
