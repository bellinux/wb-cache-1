The study consisted of three sections: (1) utilization of non-conventional feedstuffs. (2) feed additives, and (3) feed processing methods. In section one, buckwheat, <b>almond</b> <b>hulls</b> and cottonseed meal were utilized at various levels in the diets of rabbit fryers and does. The results indicated that the performance of the fryer rabbits was not affected by any dietary levels of the buckwheat, but only up to 40 % <b>almond</b> <b>hulls</b> and 10 % cottonseed meal supported adequate growth. Levels above 40 % and 10 % in <b>almond</b> <b>hulls</b> and cottonseed meal, respectively, were observed to be detrimental to the overall performance.

40|$|Objectives: <b>Almond</b> (Prunus amygdalus) <b>hull</b> {{and shell}} are {{agricultural}} by-products {{that are a}} source of phenolic compounds. The processing of almond produce shell and hull, accounts for more than 50 % by dry weight of the almond fruits. Recently, more studies have focused on the influence of storage conditions and postharvest handling on the nutritional quality of fruits, especially the antioxidant phenolics. In this study, influence of long-term storage (five years) on the total phenolic and antioxidant capacity of <b>almond</b> <b>hull</b> and shell from different genotypes was evaluated. Materials and Methods: The fruits of subjected genotypes were collected and their hull and shell were separated. They were dried and reduced to fine powder. This powder stored at room temperature for five years. The total phenolic content (TPC) and bioactivities (antioxidant potential: DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging and reducing power) of extracts were evaluated using spectrophotometric methods. Results: It was found that TPC content and bioactivity levels in the stored <b>almond</b> <b>hull</b> and shell were different, compared to the hulls and shells which were evaluated in 2007. S 1 - 4 genotype had the highest TPC and reducing power in its hull and shell.

40|$|Background and Aim: Hexavalent {{chromium}} is a metal, {{which causes}} harmful effects in surface and ground water, Its removal from contaminated water and waste water {{has received a}} great deal of interest in recent years. Thus, theaim of the presentstudy was a comparative analysis of the application of green <b>almond</b> <b>hull</b> and its resultant ash inremovingchromium from aqueous solutions. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, the effects of variables such as pH of adsorbent dose, initial chromium concentration, contact time, temperature, and adsorbent characteristics of <b>almond</b> <b>hull</b> and its resultant ash on removing of chromium from aqueous solutions were investigated. Experiments were intermittently performed in batch reactor on Shaker. Finally, in order to assess the obtained samples colorimetricmethod using UV/V Spectrophotometer T 80 + set, at a wavelength of 540, was applied. Results: The most efficient removal of hexavalent chromium occurred when pH was 2. Furthermore, it was found that removal percentage increased parallel to contact time and temperature. But, when the bioabsorbent and the resultant ash were used, a decrease in the initial hexavalent chromium density from 100 to 10 mg/lit led to a decrease in the removal percentage from 99 / 66 % to 61 / 19 % and 78 / 93 % to 37 / 01 %, respectively. It was found that by increasing the absorbent dose (i. e. the bioabsorbent) the removing percentage tended to its extreme level (100 %). However, when the absorbent ash was used, removing percentage increased at first, but then it decreased. Conclusion: Both <b>almond</b> green <b>hull</b> and its resultant ash are agents which cause effective removing of hexavalent chromium from aqueous solutions...|$|R

40|$|Almond, (Prunus dulcis D. A. Webb syn. Prunus amygdalus) is {{a species}} {{belonging}} to the Rosaceae family (Sfahlan et al. 2009). The state of California in the USA is the major producer of almond; however, its production is widely distributed (Wijerante et al. 2006) and there is increasing interest to produce almond and its by-products worldwide. Approximately 2, 112, 815 metric ton of almonds with shell is produced globally with Iran contributing about 110, 000 metric ton (FAO 2007). Almond is a midsize tree with fruit that can grow up to ten meters tall (Chen et al. 2010). The fruit is made of hulls, shell and kernel. Drying <b>almond</b> <b>hulls</b> results in approximately (kg- 1 DM) 250 g nut, 500 g hulls and 250 g shell (Aguilar et al. 1984; Fadel 1999). The current study aimed to evaluate the chemical composition and in vitro digestibility of almond tree (Prunus dulcis D. A. Webb syn. Prunus amygdalus; var. Shokoufeh) leaves versus hulls, and green versus dry leaves as feed for ruminants. The fresh green <b>almond</b> <b>hulls</b> (GAH) and leaves (GAL) were harvested and spread under a shade to dry. Dry almond leaves (DAL) were collected from under the trees where as dry <b>almond</b> <b>hulls</b> (DAH) were collected 4 weeks after harvesting the fresh samples. The chemical composition of substrates was determined using standard approaches and the metabolisable energy (ME), in vitro dry matter (DMD) and in vitro organic matter (OMD) digestibility were measured using the in vitro gas production (GP) technique. The GAL contained 81 g crude protein (CP) kg- 1 DM while DAH contained 103 g CP kg- 1 DM. The CP was higher (P = 0. 0003) in dry (leaves and hulls) than in green (leaves and hulls) samples. The ash content ranged from 99. 2 to 181. 5 g kg- 1 DM in DAH and DAL, respectively, (P = 0. 0041). The ether extract content ranged from 27 for DAH to 65 g kg- 1 for DAL (P = 0. 0018). The acid detergent fibre and neutral detergent fibre content ranged from 185 to 304 and 444 to 620 g kg- 1 DM (P = 0. 04), for GAL and DAH, respectively. The DAH had the highest (P = 0. 0001) GP 24 and GP 96. The DAH had the highest (P = 0. 0001) potential GP (i. e., b), while the GP rate was highest for GAL and GAH (P = 0. 034), ME was highest for DAH (P = 0. 0001), and in vitro OMD was highest for DAH (P = 0. 0001). The highest DMD (P = 0. 0001) values were obtained with DAH followed by GAL, DAL and GAH, respectively. It can be concluded that <b>almond</b> <b>hulls</b> and leaves have a good nutritional potential to cover the maintenance nutrient requirements of small ruminants. <b>Almond</b> <b>hulls</b> and leaves {{can also be used}} as supplement to low quality mature pasture and/or crop residues.

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that among foods, the consumption of edible nuts has beneficial effects on health which are attributed to their high content of potent antioxidants. Among nuts, the whole seed of the almond (Prunus dulcis) has been demonstrated to possess potent free radical scavenging activity, which {{is related to the}} presence of phenolic compounds. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the polyphenol content and the antioxidant ability of almond hull, which is an agriculture solid waste. The present results revealed that among different extraction methods, the acetone extract of <b>almond</b> <b>hulls</b> has a high content of phenolic and flavonoid compounds and a high antioxidant ability, which were determined by using the phosphomolybdenum method and by measuring the potency of the antioxidant, respectively. Moreover, the experimental data disclosed that the acetone extract of <b>almond</b> <b>hulls</b> provides protection against the oxidative damage and the membrane protein degradation that are caused in human erythrocytes by hydrogen peroxide. These phenomena may likely be due to the recruitment of antioxidants by cell membranes and/or translocation to cytosol. Overall, almond hull extract could be considered as a natural source of antioxidants, and its consumption could {{have a positive effect on}} human health...|$|E
30|$|The bulk densities for RMN, ATMN and BTMN {{obtained}} were 0.612, 0.584 and 0.574  g cm− 3, respectively (Table  1). RMN had {{a higher}} bulk density than ATMN and BTMN. The percentage decrease in bulk density after treatment with 0.1  M NaOH and 0.1  M HCl was 6.2 and 4.6  %, respectively. More extractives were removed by treatment with NaOH, implying that Macadamia contains more base-soluble extractives (hemicellulose fraction) than those that are acid soluble. A much higher percentage decrease of 31.0, 36.4 and 60.1  % in bulk density has been reported when corn cob, soybean <b>hull</b> and <b>almond</b> <b>hull</b> were treated, respectively, with 0.1  M NaOH for 1  h (Wartelle and Marshall 2000). The lower values obtained with Macadamia {{could be due to}} inefficient extraction process or that Macadamia does not contain a high percentage of extractives that could be removed by either acid or basic treatment. The surface area of RMN, ATMN and BTMN was 0.018, 0.065 and 0.546  m 2 g− 1, respectively. These values were comparable to other waste materials as reported in the literature (Basal et al. 2009).|$|R

In this research, the use of <b>almond</b> green <b>hull</b> (as an eco-friendly and low-cost adsorbent) with no treatment having the ability to remove toxic hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)) from aqueous solutions has been investigated. The influences of several main parameters such as pH value of solution, sorbent amount, initial metal-ion concentration, and contact time in batch experiments have been studied. The results revealed that <b>almond</b> green <b>hull</b> adsorbs over 94. 14 % of Cr (VI) from solutions containing 10 mg/L of Cr(VI) at sorbent amount of 4 g/L and pH= 6 after 30 min of equilibration at room temperature. High removal efficiency of Cr (VI) occurred in the first 5 min of sorbent contact time for concentration of 10 mg/L solution. Adsorption isotherms were compared with both Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models. The experimental data best fit with the Langmuir isotherm model with R 2 = 0. 9989.

The objective of this work {{was to assess the}} use of two almond by-products (almond shell-AS and almond hull-AH), which had been previously conditioned without composting, as substrates for pepper (cv. Caprino F 1) production and to study their effects on the yield, fruit size, and fruit mineral content. Physical, physico-chemical, and chemical characteristics of the almond by-products were determined both initially and during the pepper growing season. Initially, all values of the parameters studied ― except sulfur and iron ― differed significantly between the two substrates. During cultivation, the 18 substrate parameters and variables tested - except bulk density - exhibited significant variations with time for AS; the same occurred for AH, exceptions being pH, total nitrogen Nt, N-NH 4, bulk density, and manganese. The changes in both substrates for the K, N, and S concentrations were significant. The nutrient levels in AH were higher than for AS. The almond shell and <b>almond</b> <b>hull</b> substrates produced slight decreases in total fruit yield with respect to the control (0. 79 and 3. 22 for AS and AH, respectively), with a lesser decrease for AS, due to reductions in the number of fruits per plant rather than to reductions in individual fruit weight.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to discover the cause of a major diarrhea outbreak and fifteen pound decrease in milk production that simultaneously took place in a dairy herd located in California’s central valley. Throughout the duration of the problem there were five primary areas considered to be potential causes. These potential causes included silage quality, disease, water quality, <b>almond</b> <b>hulls</b> containing high levels of mycotoxins, and feed ration issues. The study used data from four different silage piles, each having different issues. Among these were issues of poor fermentation, low moisture content, high ash levels, and poor ensiling. Fecal, blood, and water samples were collected to test for diarrhea causing diseases such as salmonella and Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVD). Further analyses were performed on the water to test for high salinity, nitrate, and heavy metals. Along with these two tests, a necropsy was performed on an infected cow to locate any indication of disease or abnormality within the animal’s internal organs or blood. Following the necropsy, BCS and fecal scoring was administered to 400 and 420 animals respectively. These scorings were used to gauge the overall condition of the herd. Following the scorings a rumenocentisis was performed on nine animals to determine an average rumen pH level throughout the herd and whether or not there was a presence of sub-acute ruminal acidosis (SARA). The last potential cause analyzed was the feed. Feed issues included extreme mycotoxin levels in a portion of the <b>almond</b> <b>hulls,</b> sorting and particle size, as well as a possible poor balance of energy and protein in the ration. Unfortunately, none of these causes were singled out as the primary problem in the herd. Conducting these tests did however allow us to determine deficiencies within our ration and silage. The final conclusion after eleven weeks of searching was that the dairy encountered a perfect storm of several destructive events occurring at once. These events negatively impacted the rumen’s ability to digest feed properly, which resulted in the herd-wide diarrhea and reduced milk production. Further studies on this case may produce a single specific cause that may help prevent its reoccurrence in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to determine effects of feeding increasing levels of a Yucca schidigera extract (YSE) to dairy cows on 24 h in vitro gas production and 27 h in vitro neutral detergent fibre (aNDFom) digestion of 11 common dairy feedstuffs, {{as well as in}} vivo rumen fermentation and performance of the cows to which the YSE was fed. The principle was to use YSE to potentially modify the rumen microbial population in vivo and measure subsequent impacts of the adapted rumen fluid on feedstuff fermentation in vitro. Four rumen cannulated late lactation Holstein cows (810 ± 54. 7 kg body weight) were used in a 4 × 4 Latin Square design experiment with 14 d periods. Cows were housed in pens with individual feeding gates and had ad libitum access to water while fed a total mixed ration (TMR) of alfalfa hay, corn grain, barley grain, dried distillers grains, whole cottonseed, beet pulp, soybean meal, <b>almond</b> <b>hulls,</b> rumen inert fat and a mineral/salt mixture. Based upon sarsaponin assay of four commercial YSE products, Monterey Sarsaponin 15 ® was selected and added to the TMR to provide 0, 5, 10 or 15 g of sarsaponin/cow/d. Rumen fluid from each cow in each period was utilized for in vitro gas determinations to measure gas production and aNDFom digestion from the test feeds. There was a strong linear effect (P= 0. 002), at an increasing rate (quadratic P= 0. 08), to increased extent of gas production with increased feeding of YSE. There was a quadratic effect to maximum rate of gas production (P= 0. 01) at the 5 g sarsaponin level. At 4 h of fermentation, gas production increased linearly (P< 0. 05), at an increasing rate (P< 0. 002), for <b>almond</b> <b>hulls,</b> barley grain and soybean meal with increasing levels of YSE. Gas production from barley grain had a quadratic effect (P< 0. 01), suggesting a maximum at about the 5 g sarsaponin feeding level. Gas production at 24 h of fermentation increased linearly (P= 0. 03), at a decreasing rate (P< 0. 03), but only soybean meal had a quadratic tendency (P= 0. 08) to minimum gas production at about the 5 g level of sarsaponin. In vitro fermentation ofaNDFomat 27 hwas not impacted by treatment. In vivo rumen pH, concentrations of total volatile fatty acids and rumen protozoal counts were not impacted by YSE feeding level, as were milk production, milk components and net energy (NE) balance. However, correlations between NE output and the proportional increases in 4 h gas production with increasing levels of YSE in the diet suggest that this measure may be predictive of animal responses to this YSE. Finally, multivariate analysis, used to create equations to predict impacts of the nutrients in the 11 feedstuffs on their proportional increase in 4 h gas production, suggests that the increase in 4 h gas production of any feed may be predicted from its organic nutrient profile, offering the potential to determine the optimal feeding level of sarsaponin in any TMR based on its nutrient profile...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Information about {{degradability}} of nutrients, effective degradability (ED) {{values and}} digestion kinetics of agricultural wastes {{is important for}} feed manufacturing industry and farmers performing feed mixing practices who currently rely on nutritive values published by research institutions. <b>Almond</b> <b>hull</b> (AH) and cucumber plant (CW) were evaluated for ruminal dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) degradation kinetics. Methodology: Duplicate bags containing 3 g ground raw material each were incubated in the rumen of two ruminally cannulated Assaf rams for 4, 8, 16, 24, 48 and 72 h. Rate and extent of ruminal degradation were estimated. Results: Significant effects of byproduct type were observed in rapidly soluble and potentially degradable fractions, and degradation rates of DM, CP, ADF and NDF. The rapidly soluble DM, CP, ADF and NDF fractions were 16. 10, 15. 2, 10. 64 and 14. 06 % for CW, and 7. 21, 6. 64, 6. 00 and 5. 62 % for AH. The potentially degradable DM, CP, ADF and NDF fractions, respectively, were 55. 82, 62. 30, 49. 40 and 55. 09 % for CW, and 47. 61, 44. 26, 46. 34 and 48. 53 % for AH. The DM, CP, ADF and NDF disappearance in CW were higher (P < 0. 05) compared to those in AH.

Almonds were very easily separated from the tree, and this circumstance considerably improved the mechanical harvesting operation efficiency even if the total time was mainly affected by the time required to manoeuvre the machine and by the following manual tree beating. The mechanical pick-up from the ground was not effective, with only 30 % of the dropped almond collected, which mainly was caused by both the pick-up reel of the machine being unable to approach the almonds dropped near the base of the trunk and the surface condition of the soil being unsuitably arranged for a mechanized pick-up operation.

40|$|AbstractNutrient {{composition}} of the feed and formulated ration often differ depending on uncertainties in DM content and nutrient {{composition of}} ingredients, {{as well as from}} feeder errors during loading. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe the deviation from target weight for the high-producing cow ration (HCR) and premix (HCP) on 26 California dairies ranging in size from 1, 100 to 6, 900 cows. Records from a consecutive 12 -mo period were extracted from FeedWatch 7 (Valley Agricultural Software Inc., Tulare, CA), a feeding management software. Variables extracted and studied were date, recipe type, recipe number, ingredient, loading sequence, target weight, weight, and tolerance level (TL, deviation allowed per ingredient during loading). Based on the distribution of the deviation from target weight for the 8 most common ingredients, loading accuracy (quartile 1; small: | 20 | kg), loading precision (interquartile range=quartile 3 to 1; small: 40 kg), and extreme observations (quartile 3; small: | 40 | kg) were described. Descriptive statistics were conducted with SAS 9. 4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The median TL assigned to ingredients across dairies ranged from 0 to 90 kg. At the ingredient level, the TL allowed a deviation from the median ingredient target weight of 0 to 2 (53. 9 %), > 2 to 5 (25. 5 %), > 5 to 10 (11. 6 %), or > 10 % (8. 9 %). A total of 2. 5 % of the loads did not reach the target weight set by the TL, ranging from 0. 1 to 21. 1 % loads across dairies. Ingredient deviation from the formulated target weight across dairies was below target 49. 1 % of the time [0 to 2 (36. 7 %), > 2 to 5 (8. 9 %), > 5 to 10 (1. 2 %), > 10 % (0. 2 %) ]. Five dairies loaded ingredients with adequate accuracy (small to medium, quartile 1) and adequate precision (small to medium, interquartile range), but accuracy and precision were very poor on 3 dairies (large, quartile 1 and interquartile range). Rolled corn and <b>almond</b> <b>hulls</b> were loaded with adequate precision (small to medium, interquartile range) on a minimum of 64 % of the dairies and adequate accuracy (small, quartile 1) on at least 68 % of the dairies. In contrast, alfalfa hay, corn silage, and canola were loaded with poor precision (large, interquartile range) on a minimum of 60 % of the dairies. There was a large variation within and across dairies on the deviation from target weight. Readjusting the TL settings might reduce the deviation from target weight. On 5 dairies, feeders were able to load ingredients with minimal deviation from target weight, setting achievable goals for the industry. Based on loading errors, opportunities exist to improve feeder performance on California dairies...|$|E
40|$|Common {{contemporary}} {{diet formulation}} methods involve factorial or empirical models which simulate ruminal fermentation and post ruminal absorption to predict nutrient supply and needs. However, {{due to their}} inability to encompass all animal factors that affect digestion and absorption, metabolic models inadequately predict microbial protein (MCP) synthesis in the rumen and passage of nutrients such as protein and amino acids (AA) to the small intestine. Practical and simple on-farm methods to obtain “real time” values directly from cows are required to establish normal ranges of MCP flow from the rumen and plasma AA concentrations on commercial dairy farms. Urine purine derivative (PD) output, an index of MCP supply to the intestine when analyzed in spot urine samples, can accurately predict MCP flow from the rumen under farm conditions. Blood sampling from the tail vein is easily performed on commercial dairy farms and concentrations of free AA in these plasma samples, representative of intestinally absorbed AA, {{can be used as}} an index to predict limiting AA. A group of 20 commercial dairy farms, milking 2677 + 372 cows either 2 or 3 times a day were selected and one of their early lactation pens holding 255 + 20 cows were used to represent the range of nutritional strategies and rations fed to California dairy cows. On the day of sampling, one load of early lactation total mixed ration (TMR) was sampled and 20 pre-selected cows were body condition scored (BCS). Directly after scoring, the 4 cows with the highest, and the 4 cows with the lowest BCS values were removed to collect 12 tail vein blood samples from the group with average BCS scores. Spot urine samples were collected from all voluntarily urinating cows (retaining 6 to 12 samples/pen to match the characteristics of the cows pre-selected for BCS scoring and blood sampling). Most rations contained alfalfa hay, corn silage, <b>almond</b> <b>hulls,</b> corn dried distillers grains, corn grain, cottonseed, canola meal (solvent) and a mineral premix. Selected cow groups produced 45 ± 1. 2 kg milk/day at 73 ± 0. 5 days in milk with a BCS of 2. 6 + 0. 04 at 2. 8 lactations. There were no correlations between MCP and milk production, but MCP flow from the rumen was correlated to organic matter and neutral detergent fiber content of the TMR (P< 0. 01 and P= 0. 03 respectively). Plasma AA concentrations were correlated with rumen undegradable crude protein (CP) and starch content of the TMR, with many inter-correlations among AA, but no plasma AA concentration was correlated to milk production. Results show that 8 urine samples and 6 blood samples/group provided accurate representation of the group. This study documents ranges of MCP flowing from the rumen (1703 ± 54. 6 g CP/day), and plasma AA levels (with low variation within AA), in early lactation multiparity Holstein cows fed a range of contemporary dairy rations with multiple ingredient profile combinations. Since farms selected were well managed operations with cow groups selected to represent averages in early lactation, this data {{can be used as a}} benchmark for high, low and mean levels of MCP flow, and plasma AA concentrations, as well as provide real time evaluation of rations to identify possible rumen microbial growth and/or absorbable AA issues in commercial dairy cows.
