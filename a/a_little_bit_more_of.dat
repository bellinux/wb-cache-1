500|$|... "A Little Bit" [...] {{was written}} by Kara DioGuardi, Steve Morales and David Siegal, and was {{produced}} by Morales and Ric Wake. The song became DioGuardi's first writing credit for an artist from her native country. Simpson's vocals were recorded by Dan Hetzel at Sony Music Studios, New York City, and the track was mixed by Hetzel along with Richie Jones at Cove City Sound Studios, Glen Cove, New York. Keyboard programming was done by Eric Kupper. According to Simpson, [...] "the message behind the song is for guys {{to listen to the}} girl". [...] "A guy needs to give <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> himself, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> his time. It's about the love going so much further, the guy would actually be selfless," [...] she expanded on the song's theme. In the United States, [...] "A Little Bit" [...] was released as the second single from Irresistible. The song saw an airplay-only release there, while in Australia, a physical single was issued on October29,2001. [...] "A Little Bit" [...] was used to promote Bally Total Fitness and thus, a limited CD single pressing was made available to people who joined the club. The song was also utilized for the company's promotional advertisement campaign.|$|E
500|$|The {{series has}} {{received}} mixed critical reception; About.com's Nancy Basile gave the series {{four out of}} five stars, opining that the series is [...] "what Adult Swim should be ... experimental, but in a cheap, simple, not-trying-to-be-cool way." [...] She found the crude animation [...] "refreshing" [...] but joked that the series [...] "can kill" [...] viewers not used to the slow pace. Writing for AOL TV, Adam Finley regarded the show as [...] "the most simplistically drawn of all the Adult Swim shows, and yet the most complex in terms of story." [...] He contrasted it with other Williams Street productions, finding it to [...] "instead unrave slowly, revealing <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> what's underneath the surface while also piling on more and more questions." [...] Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork Media called it [...] "the asymptote of the block's crude style".|$|E
500|$|Very {{little of}} the design from Freelance Police was carried over into Save the World; LucasArts still held onto the assets created for use in Freelance Police, and Telltale was wary of using similar design patterns. While Ferguson and Purcell had both been {{involved}} with the canceled LucasArts project, Grossman had not. The team decided to just start from fresh, and pursue a different treatment of the game's subject. Purcell himself wanted to ensure that the game conveyed the [...] "gritty" [...] feel of the original comics—something he felt was lacking from the LucasArts renditions of the franchise. Grossman stated that [...] "we wanted to get <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> that dirt on the streets, and the paper cups and people being mean and nasty". This [...] "gritty" [...] feeling also influenced artistic design. For instance, on Purcell's suggestion, the sky was changed from blue to yellow in the street outside Sam and Max's office, instantly making the environment feel [...] "filthy and disgusting".|$|E

500|$|The first-round {{series against}} the Magic was touted as the matchup {{between two of the}} league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard. Howard {{dominated}} throughout the series, while Bosh had a serires-best effort in Game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds. General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, [...] "Whether it's protecting [...] inside the paint, getting <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul. Bosh said after the loss, [...] "They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did and {{when it came to the}} small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good." [...] Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{also said}} that her music would be getting [...] "real fucking dark", though also stated that her fans {{would be able to}} relate to it. [...] "I imagine that maybe my next record would be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an artistic venture," [...] she said. [...] "Not that I'm going to self-sabotage either and be like, 'I'm going to make a crazy record that nobody really understands.'" [...] That fall, she later told Billboard about her plans for the album, saying she already envisioned several aspects of it. Perry told the {{magazine}} that she already had songs and ideas, and knew the type of record she would make next. She {{also said that}} although she had not started recording yet, she already knew how the artwork, coloring and tone of the album would turn out. Perry further detailed: [...] "I have to let the music take shape first. I even know what type of tour I'm doing next. I'll be very pleased if the vision I have in my head becomes a reality. But I have to honor the music." ...|$|E
500|$|Bungie {{used the}} beta to fix mistakes, glitches, and balance issues within {{gameplay}} elements. [...] "We needed our fans to provide feedback," [...] said Lehto, adding {{that having a}} large audience to [...] "hammer" [...] on the game allowed them to gather useful feedback to mold the finished product. The game automatically collected statistics such as upload and matchmaking speeds, as well as game preferences; sorting out what Jarrard called [...] "the more subjective anecdotal feedback" [...] from emails, notes, and forums proved more difficult. The Reach beta generated over 360,000 forum posts on Bungie's community forums. Bungie created official threads for groups of issues to manage the high volume of feedback; [...] "We tried to give people <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a direct avenue to give that feedback and to make our lives easier. It was definitely a lot to assess and digest," [...] said Jarrard. Certain feedback from the players did not correlate with the statistical data obtained from the matches during the beta. Chris Carney, lead designer for the multiplayer mode, recalled vocal dissatisfaction with the pistol early in the beta; {{by the end of}} the beta, the weapon was responsible for most of the kills coming from newly included weapons in the game. Bungie deployed special test matches to eliminate lurking variables, balance gameplay, and make other informed changes.|$|E

[...] "Jim Jinkins is an illustrator and not an animator, so his initial drawings were <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a wiggly line," [...] said Yvette Kaplan.

Lennertz' score for the short is [...] "rock-based", with a lot of electronics and guitars. For the opening bank robbery, [...] "We had a big twangy low guitar theme, almost like a Jack White kind of a thing on guitar". At the end of the short, when money 'rains down', Lennertz paid homage to Ennio Morricone with vocals in a [...] "classic spoofy" [...] way.|$|E

2500|$|Orton was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium, his maroon cloth-draped coffin {{being brought}} into the west chapel to a {{recording}} of The Beatles song [...] "A Day in the Life". Harold Pinter read the eulogy, concluding with [...] "He was a bloody marvellous writer." [...] According to Dennis Dewsnap's memoir, What's Sex Got To Do With It (The Syden Press, 2004), Orton and Halliwell had their ashes mixed and were buried together. Dewsnap writes about Orton's agent Peggy Ramsay: [...] "...At the scattering of Joe's and Kenneth's ashes, his sister took a handful from both urns and said, 'A little bit of Joe, {{and a little bit}} of Kenneth. I think perhaps <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> our Joe, and then some more of Kenneth.' At which Peggy snapped, 'Come on, dearie, it's only a gesture, not a recipe. She described Orton's relatives as simply [...] "the little people in Leicester", leaving a cold, nondescript note and bouquet at the funeral on their behalf.|$|E
2500|$|As with Lewis's debut album, Spirit, each of Echos {{producers}} were enlisted by her mentors Simon Cowell and Clive Davis. Unlike {{her debut}} album where she travelled between cities, Lewis remained in Los Angeles for {{the recording of}} Echo, which took nine months to produce. It contains ballads, racier tracks and dancefloor anthems. Lewis titled the album Echo [...] "since an echo describes a big, organic sound," [...] and it appealed to her love of fantasy as Echo was a nymph who, in Greek mythology, [...] "pined away till only her voice remained." [...] In August 2009 Lewis told her official website: [...] "I'm {{in the midst of}} the recording process, working with incredible songwriters and producers, and my music has really evolved. It's so exciting to create something new." [...] She also said, [...] "I'm actually more confident with this album than the last. I've taken more control this time and I feel more at ease with everything." [...] She told Variety magazine that she [...] "wanted the album to have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a live feel to it, with a little more live instrumentation," [...] and described Echo as [...] "more guitar-driven" [...] compared to Spirit, with a [...] "harder edge" [...] in an interview with Seventeen.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{commented on}} the musical style of her debut album {{describing}} the album as [...] "classic songs with a contemporary edge", with R and [...] "fresh pop" [...] styles, ballads and [...] "soulful up-tempo numbers". It has an American style, with some electronic 1980s sounds. However, the songs are not beat-driven or following the latest trends but can be performed acoustically. Lewis's second album, [...] "Echo", mixed pop and R during an interview with Variety magazine, she said on the album's sound that she [...] "wanted the album to have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a live feel to it, {{with a little more}} live instrumentation." [...] In February 2011, talking about her third studio album [...] "Glassheart", Lewis said that the album would be more experimental than Spirit and Echo by embodying a [...] "different" [...] yet [...] "classic" [...] sound. She added, [...] "I'm really, really excited about it. I'm working with some new producers, some up and coming people and it's going to be kind of a different sound – but still classic". Lewis described it as [...] "energetic, deep, [...] unique". She also commented that it would have a darker tone and that she would be putting her [...] "heart into [...] lyrics".|$|E

2500|$|Co-producer Greenwalt points out, [...] "There's {{no denying}} that Angel grew out of Buffy." [...] Several years before Angel debuted, Joss Whedon {{developed}} the concept behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer to invert the Hollywood formula of [...] "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie." [...] The character Angel was first seen in the first episode and became a regular, appearing in the opening credits during seasons 2 and 3. According to the fictional universe first established by Slayer, the 'Buffyverse', Angel was born in 18th-century Ireland; after being turned into a soulless, immortal vampire, he became legendary for his evil acts, until a band of wronged Gypsies punished him by restoring his soul, overwhelming him with guilt. Angel eventually {{set out on a}} path of redemption, hoping that he could make up for his past through good deeds. In Buffys Season Three finale, he leaves Sunnydale for L.A. to continue his atonement without Buffy. Whedon believed that [...] "Angel was the one character who was bigger than life {{in the same way that}} Buffy was, a kind of superhero." [...] Whedon has compared the series to its parent, [...] "It's a little bit more straightforward action show and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a guys' show." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Suppose a solid held {{above the}} surface of a liquid and {{partially}} immersed: a portion of the liquid is displaced, and the level of the liquid rises. But, by this rise of level, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the solid is of course immersed, and so there is a new displacement of a second portion of the liquid, and a consequent rise of level. Again, this second rise of level causes a yet further immersion, and by consequence another displacement of liquid and another rise. It is self-evident that this process must continue till the entire solid is immersed, and that the liquid will then begin to immerse whatever holds the solid, which, being connected with it, must for the time be considered a part of it. If you hold a stick, six feet long, with its end in a tumbler of water, and wait long enough, you must eventually be immersed. The question as to the source from which the water is supplied--which belongs to a high branch of mathematics, and is therefore beyond our present scope--does not apply to the sea. Let us therefore take the familiar instance of a man {{standing at the edge of}} the sea, at ebb-tide, with a solid in his hand, which he partially immerses: he remains steadfast and unmoved, and we all know that he must be drowned. The multitudes who daily perish in this manner to attest a philosophical truth, and whose bodies the unreasoning wave casts sullenly upon our thankless shores, have a truer claim to be called the martyrs of science than a Galileo or a Kepler. To use Kossuth's eloquent phrase, they are the unnamed demigods of the nineteenth century."[B] ...|$|E
