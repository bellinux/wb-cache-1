40|$|A {{multiplex}} PCR {{designed to}} differentiate Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex organisms from M. avium and M. intracellulare {{was used to}} test 105 isolates identified by DNA probe methods <b>as</b> <b>M.</b> avium, M. intracellulare, or M. avium complex type X. The multiple PCR correctly identified 33 of 34 isolates identified by commercial probe methods <b>as</b> <b>M.</b> avium and all 51 isolates identified <b>as</b> <b>M.</b> intracellulare. The 20 isolates identified <b>as</b> <b>M.</b> avium complex type X by probe were identified as Mycobacterium spp. by the multiplex method. These results confirm that the multiplex PCR, which is simple to perform and cheaper than commercial probe methods, is suitable for routine identification of M. avium and M. intracellulare...|$|R
5|$|In 1974, a {{paved road}} was built from MS 2 to the Alcorn–Tishomingo county line. It was later {{extended}} to MS 25 in 1981, and was designated <b>as</b> <b>MS</b> 350 {{in the same}} year. No significant changes {{have been made to}} the route since.|$|E
5|$|A {{road from}} US 82 to MS 1 was {{constructed}} during 1940, and opened in 1941. The road was unsigned, and was already paved in concrete. It was designated <b>as</b> <b>MS</b> 454 by 1953. By 1999, US 278 became concurrent with US 82 through MS 454's western terminus. A bypass around Greenville has been planned in the 1990s, and construction began in 2008. It was partially built before funding stopped. A bridge for MS 454's future alignment has been built, with no roads connecting to it.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was originally}} published in 1723 as Hemingi chartularium ecclesiæ Wigorniensis, in two volumes edited by Thomas Hearne. This {{was part of the}} Chronica Anglia series put out between 1709 and 1735, which included many chronicles and records in 20volumes. Hearne printed his edition from a transcription made for the antiquary Richard Graves. This transcript, known <b>as</b> <b>MS</b> Rawlinson B.445, is not a completely accurate transcription of the Cotton Tiberius manuscript, as some items were omitted, and marginalia were not always transcribed. There were also some additions of decorations.|$|E

5|$|Hemming's Cartulary is a {{manuscript}} cartulary, or collection of charters and other land records, collected by a monk named Hemming {{around the time}} of the Norman Conquest of England. The manuscript comprises two separate cartularies that were made at different times and later bound together; it is in the British Library <b>as</b> <b>MS</b> Cotton Tiberius A xiii. The first was composed at the end of the 10th or beginning of the 11th century. The second section was compiled by Hemming and was written around the end of the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century. The first section, traditionally titled the Liber Wigorniensis, is a collection of Anglo-Saxon charters and other land records, most of which are organized geographically. The second section, Hemming's Cartulary proper, combines charters and other land records with a narrative of deprivation of property owned by the church of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, US 98 {{replaced}} the MS 24 designation from US 51 in McComb to east of McLain; as a result, MS 24 was {{split into two}} segments. In 1957, the paved portion of MS 24 west of Woodville was extended further to the west. The eastern segment of MS 24 between McLain and the Alabama border was redesignated <b>as</b> <b>MS</b> 594 in 1958. In 1962, the highway was paved to a point east of Fort Adams. Paving was completed on the remainder of MS 24 leading to Fort Adams in 1964. In 1967, the eastern terminus of MS 24 was truncated to its current location at the interchange with I-55; US 98 {{replaced the}} route between there and US 51. Since then, MS 24 has remained on the same alignment.|$|E

25|$|A road first {{appeared}} in maps in 1998, connecting from Artesia Road to US 82. The northern section of it became state maintained in 2001, as Industrial Park Road was constructed.
