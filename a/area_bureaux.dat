50|$|Underneath Rainbow Basin is {{the massive}} {{batholith}} that lies below {{much of the}} western Mojave (Dibblee 1968:15). Made from a type of rock called quartz monzonite, this batholith dates to either the Cretaceous, or possibly the late Jurassic period (Dibblee 1967:43). Early in the Cenozoic Era this batholith was exposed in the area surrounding Rainbow Basin and bent downward as it underwent compression, to form a basin (Bureau of Land Management 1992:30). Sediments deposited in this basin became the sedimentary rocks that are most visible in Rainbow Basin today (Dibblee 1968:56-57). Further compression, uplift, and finally extension left these sedimentary formations deeply folded, the most prominent fold being the Barstow Syncline. These same stresses also produced several faults in the Rainbow Basin <b>area</b> (<b>Bureau</b> of Land Management 1992:30).|$|R

The Rapibus would also pass near the proposed sports complex in the Gatineau sector, as well as near the Casino du Lac-Leamy and the downtown Hull sector <b>area.</b> <b>Bureau</b> added that the city opted for bus rapid-transit ahead of light-rail service as the project was long-awaited. A transportation committee set up by Ottawa Mayor Larry O'Brien and led by former Liberal Minister David Collenette proposed light-rail extensions to Gatineau, Wakefield and Masson-Angers on existing railways right near most of the proposed Rapibus corridor.|$|R

Public Law 87-594, approved August 24, 1962 (76 Stat. 395) authorized the Arbuckle Project. The final development plan was completed in 1964. A contract to construct Arbuckle Dam was awarded June 9, 1964, and completed June 30, 1966. The project also incorporated certain other infrastructure. These included an aqueduct and pumping system to supply water to area customers, The contract for this construction was awarded August 27, 1965, and the work was completed in 1968.

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines is {{conducting}} research {{to assess the}} effectiveness of different chain pillar designs in maintaining gate entry stability. A particular concern is ground control for deep- cover longwalls located at depths in excess of 1, 000 ft. The study described in this report was performed in two experimental sections in one longwall headgate section which contained three different pillar designs. Two of the designs used conventional abutment pillars, while the third was a total-yielding pillar system. Both of the test areas were located under 1, 800 ft of cover. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of these three pillar designs for gate road stability. As the longwall mined passed the test <b>areas,</b> <b>Bureau</b> engineers monitored entry convergence, roof sag, and changes in roof quality. The study indicated that the all-yield system performed nearly as well as the better of the two abutment pillar systems, but all three designs would have failed to provide acceptable stability for second panel mining without considerable artificial support.
