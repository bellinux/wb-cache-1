5|$|By {{the time}} Lynch left in 1989, Butthole Surfers' stage show {{had become more}} predictable, with {{previously}} random shockers being done <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>point</b> in each night's performance. Teresa Nervosa quit for good around the same time, and King Coffey became the band's sole percussionist. Strobe lights, smoke machines, and even Gibby Haynes' burning cymbal are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no longer on display.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem of}} {{counting}} {{the number of}} solutions to different types of Apollonius' problem belongs to the field of enumerative geometry. The general number of solutions for each of the ten types of Apollonius' problem is given in Table1 above. However, special arrangements of the given elements may change the number of solutions. For illustration, Apollonius' problem has no solution if one circle separates the two (Figure11); to touch both the solid given circles, the solution circle would have to cross the dashed given circle; but that it cannot do, if it is to touch the dashed circle tangentially. Conversely, if three given circles are all tangent <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>point,</b> then any circle tangent <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>point</b> is a solution; such Apollonius problems have an infinite number of solutions. If any of the given circles are identical, there is likewise an infinity of solutions. If only two given circles are identical, there are only two distinct given circles; the centers of the solution circles form a hyperbola, as used in one solution to Apollonius' problem.|$|E

5|$|The moons {{discovered}} by Galileo—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—are {{among the largest}} satellites in the Solar System. The orbits of three of them (Io, Europa, and Ganymede) form a pattern known as a Laplace resonance; for every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter, Europa makes exactly two orbits and Ganymede makes exactly one. This resonance causes the gravitational effects of the three large moons to distort their orbits into elliptical shapes, because each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbors <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>point</b> in every orbit it makes. The tidal force from Jupiter, on the other hand, works to circularize their orbits.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Holliday model for homologous recombination, single-strand breaks occur <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>point</b> on one strand of each parental DNA. Free ends of each broken strand then migrate {{across to the}} other DNA helix. There, the invading strands are joined to the free ends they encounter, resulting in the Holliday junction. As each crossover strand reanneals to its original partner strand, it displaces {{the original}} complementary strand ahead of it. This causes the Holliday junction to migrate, creating the heteroduplex segments. Depending on which strand {{was used as a}} template to repair the other, the four cells resulting from meiosis might end up with three copies of one allele and only one of the other, instead of the normal two of each, a property known as gene conversion.|$|E
5|$|The {{highway is}} {{maintained}} by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Part of the TxDOT's job is to measure traffic along the highway. These counts are taken using a metric called annual average daily traffic (AADT), a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles that travel along {{a portion of the}} highway. The TxDOT usually measures AADT near an intersection. In 2011, the highway's AADT count was 1500 vehicles, taken at a point just after the intersection with SH 87. This was an increase from the previous year, when the AADT <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>point</b> was approximately 1400 vehicles. This was also an increase from 2009, when the route's AADT was just 1100 vehicles, also taken from the same point. No portion of the roadway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

25|$|By definition, {{different}} streamlines at {{the same}} instant in a flow do not intersect, because a fluid particle cannot have two different velocities <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>point.</b> Similarly, streaklines cannot intersect themselves or other streaklines, because two particles cannot be present {{at the same}} location {{at the same instant}} of time; unless the origin point of one of the streaklines also belongs to the streakline of the other origin point.

25|$|Resistance to {{ketoconazole}} {{has been}} observed {{in a number of}} clinical fungal isolates, including Candida albicans. Experimentally, resistance usually arises as a result of mutations in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Defects in the sterol 5-6 desaturase enzyme reduce the toxic effects of azole inhibition of the 14-alpha demethylation step. Multidrug-resistance (MDR) genes can also play a role in reducing cellular levels of the drug. As azole antifungals all act <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>point</b> in the sterol pathway, resistant isolates are normally cross-resistant to all members of the azole family.|$|E

25|$|A CMOS {{image sensor}} (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) {{is an image}} sensor {{consisting}} of an integrated circuit containing an array of pixel sensors, each pixel containing a photodetector and an active amplifier.

CMOS image sensors {{can be found in}} digital SLR cameras, embedded web-cams, video cameras, automotive safety systems, swallowable-pill cameras, toys and video games, and wireless video-security networks. The renowned American physicist and engineer Eric Fossum invented the CMOS image sensor while working at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. On January 28, 1994, Fossum filed U.S. patent #5,471,515, which was issued to him on November 28, 1995.|$|E
25|$|A major {{advantage}} {{was that}} the adjustment (to set where on the propeller's disc each bullet was to impact) was now in the gun itself. This meant that each gun was adjusted separately, an important feature, since twin synchronized guns were not set to be fired in strict unison, but when they were pointing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>point</b> on the propeller disc. Each gun could be fired independently, since it had its own flexible drive, linked to the engine camshaft by a junction box, and having its own clutch. This provision of a quite separate set of components for each gun also meant that a failure in the gear for one gun did not impinge on the other.|$|E
25|$|Imagineers {{redesigned}} {{the ride}} {{system for the}} attraction at Disney California Adventure and made some changes to the show scenes. The attraction featured three elevator shafts.

Each shaft had the capacity to accommodate two vehicles operating from two load levels, each vehicle loading and unloading <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>point.</b> The ride was designed so that one vehicle could be in its ride profile while the other was at its loading level, giving each ride shaft the ability to accommodate more riders. Disney used this ride system again for Walt Disney Studios Park's version of the ride, and for Tokyo DisneySea's Hotel Hightower.|$|E
