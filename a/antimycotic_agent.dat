5000|$|A {{symptomatic}} {{patient will}} present an unusual amount of itching and alopecia. [...] Primary treatment involves griseofulvin, an <b>antimycotic</b> <b>agent.</b> For patients who don't respond to Griseofulvin, other drugs, Itraconazole, fluconazole, and terbinafine {{can be used}} as a replacement to or in conjunction with griseofulvin. These drugs are preferred over griseofulvin as they have a shorter duration for treatment. [...] However, these agents have drug-drug interactions and over a prolonged period of time can cause liver damage. [...] Currently, squalamine, an aminosterol with fungicidal properties is being researched as its mechanism of action is different from that of the aforementioned medicines, making it a good drug for those who don't respond well to Itraconazole, fluconazole or terbinafine. Systemic treatment with oral medication and anti-fungal shampoos has also been effective. [...] Antifungal shampoos (Ketoconazole 2% shampoo or selenium sulfide 2.5% [...] ) are effective as they reduce the transmission of the diseased hair by preventing its shedding. [...] Other treatments include, epilation of the infected follicles, topical ointments and steroidal treatments. Topical ointments immobilize the fungus and reduce shedding but they do not penetrate the hair follicle and hence must be used in conjunction with other treatment methods.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the presence of multidrug resistant yeasts in the faeces of synanthropic wild birds from the Bangsar suburb of Kuala Lumpur. Methods Species characterisations of yeast isolates and determinations of antimycotic susceptibility profiles were undertaken using the commercial characterization kit, Integral System Yeasts Plus (Liofilchem, Italy). Results Fourteen species of yeasts were detected in the bird faecal samples. Candida albicans was present in 28. 89 % of bird faecal samples, Candida krusei (13. 33 %), Candida tropicalis (4. 44 %), Candida glabrata (4. 44 %), Candida parapsilosis (2. 22 %), Candida lambica (2. 22 %), Candida stellatoidea (2. 22 %), Candida rugosa (2. 22 %) and Candida lusitaniae (2. 22 %). Amongst the non-candidal yeast isolates, Cryptococcus laurentii was present in 6. 67 % of bird faecal samples, Cryptococcus uniguttulatus (4. 44 %), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4. 44 %), Trichosporon pullulans (2. 22 %), Trichosporon pullulans/Cryptococcus albidus (8. 89 %) and Rhodotorula rubra/Rhodotorula glutinis (4. 44 %). Of the isolated yeasts, 18. 1 % (or 26 / 144) were found to be resistant to all 11 <b>antimycotic</b> <b>agents</b> they were tested against i. e.

40|$|In-vitro proteinase {{production}} by oral Candida albicans isolates from patients {{with and without}} HIV infection (18 isolates from each group) was assessed by image analysis of a plate assay, with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a substrate. The effect of sub-minimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of nystatin, amphotericin B, clotrimazole and miconazole on in-vitro proteinase {{production by}} these yeast isolates was also investigated. Proteinase production by C. albicans isolates from patients with HIV infection was significantly greater than production by those from individuals without infection. All 18 isolates from HIV-infected individuals produced proteinase, in comparison to 56 % of isolates from uninfected individuals. Pre-exposure of C. albicans isolates (seven proteinase producers from each group) to 1 / 4 and 1 / 16 MICs of nystatin, amphotericin B, clotrimazole and miconazole resulted in decreased proteinase production in all isolates tested. However, after exposure to the four <b>antimycotic</b> <b>agents,</b> proteinase production was decreased to a significantly greater extent in isolates from uninfected individuals than in those with HIV disease. Furthermore, when the relative concentration effect of <b>antimycotic</b> <b>agents</b> on proteinase production was compared, C. albicans isolates from the HIV-free group demonstrated a salient dose-response relationship compared with the HIV-infected group. These results indicate that C. albicans from patients with HIV infection are significantly more proteolytic than those from individuals without the infection, and that polyenes and imidazoles curtail the proteolytic activity of all C. albicans isolates, albeit {{to a lesser extent}} in those from HIV-infected patients.
