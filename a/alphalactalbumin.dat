40|$|HAMLET (Human <b>alphalactalbumin</b> made lethal to tumor cells), {{a complex}} between the {{partially}} unfolded <b>alphalactalbumin</b> and oleic acid, {{was discovered by}} serendipity when anti-adhesive properties of human milk were examined. HAMLET kills tumor cells but not healthy differentiated cells. Native <b>alphalactalbumin</b> (HLA) can be conveted to HAMLET by a two-step process including: 1) calcium ion removal inducing a teritary change of the protein structure. 2) incorporation of oleic acid into the apo-protein by an ion-exchange chromatography. <b>Alphalactalbumin</b> from several species {{can be converted to}} HAMLET like complexes. The tumor killing complex is present in human casein after low pH preicipitation in contrast to animal-casein. The results suggest that the <b>alphalactalbumin</b> protein from different species fulfill the properties for HAMLET formation but oleic acid is not accessible in the animal caseins. HAMLET interaction with membranes was investigated as a mechanism for HAMLET uptake. HAMLET interacts and pertubes the structure of membrane vesicle and induce leakage of small molecules as well as morphological changes but {{there was no evidence of}} HAMLET uptake into the vesicles. The HAMLET activity was investigated in vivo. Patients with bladder cancer were subjected to daily intravesicle HAMLET instillations. Massive tumor cell shedding was detected into urine after each instillation and a decrease in tumor volume was detected at surgery. HAMLET had a tumor selective activity in human patients as there were no detectable signs of cell death in the healthy tissue of the bladder. The therapeutically value of HAMLET was further investigated in an orthotopic mouse model. Tumor area in HAMLET treated animals were significant reduced compare to controls. Whole body imaging showed retention of HAMLET in tumor bearing tissue as Alexa-labelled HAMLET was visualized in the bladder 4 hours after the instillation. In summery, we show that human milk is a source for tumor killing molecules. We described the composition and the conditions for HAMLET formation and we also shows evidence for therapeutically value in vivo...|$|E
40|$|<b>Alphalactalbumin</b> (α-La) and {{betalactoglobulin}} (β-Lg) in the rehydration of bovine colostrum powder {{were successfully}} separated by cloud point extraction using a nonionic surfactant Triton X- 114.

40|$|Serotonergic hypofunction may {{underlie}} {{at least}} part of the symptoms that are experienced by women with premenstrual complaints, including memory deficits. In the current study we investigated changes in memory functions in the premenstrual phase compared to the early postmenstrual phase in 16 women with premenstrual complaints. In addition, the effect of an acute serotonergic stimulation by administration of an alpha-lactalbumin protein on premenstrual memory performance was assessed using a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. It was found that both short-term and long-term memory for words (30 -word learning task) and abstract figures (abstract visual learning task) were mildly impaired in the premenstrual phase. Administration of alpha-lactalbumin during the premenstrual phase could only partially attenuate the memory performance decrements that are seen in the premenstrual phase. Specifically, <b>alphalactalbumin</b> improved long-term memory for abstract figures, but not for words. There were no effects of menstrual phase or alpha-lactalbumin on planning functions (computerized Tower of London). The data suggest that serotonergic hypofunction may play a role in premenstrual memory decline, but serotonergic mechanisms cannot fully account for observed cognitive changes in the premenstrual phase...|$|E
40|$|The final {{structure}} {{and stability of}} supramolecular objects result from interactions between proteins at amino-acid level. Their characterization {{is the basis for}} the design of new proteinbased biomaterials. In this study we focus on the interactions and assembly of bovine <b>alphalactalbumin</b> (LAC) with hen egg white lysozyme (LYS). While LYS interacts with the apo and holo forms of LAC (Ca 2 + depleted and loaded form respectively), these interactions lead to the formation of micro-spheres with apoLAC only. Our objectives are to identify the amino-acids involved in the interactions and to establish the mechanism of such self-assemblyinto suprastructures. The early step of the process is most probably the formation of heterodimers. A structural characterization of both holoLAC-LYS and apoLAC-LYS dimers was performed in order to understand why micro-spheres are formed with apoLAC only. The surfaces of interaction of holoLAC with LYS and LYS with the holo and apo forms of LAC were determined using (1 H, 15 N) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. Interacting amino-acids were identified according to the chemical shift perturbations measured during titration of one 15 Nlabelled protein by its non-labelled partner. The titration of 15 N-holoLAC by LYS indicatesthat holoLAC interacts with LYS through its beta-domain (beta-sheet and flexible loop). The reverse titration indicates that LYS interacts with holoLAC mainly through its alpha-domain, including amino-acids of helices B and D and C- and N-terminal regions. Few residues of its beta-domain are also involved. In both cases the surfaces of interaction are localized {{on one side of the}} proteins and are composed of contiguous surface patches. LYS interacts with the apo form of LAC mainly through its alpha-domain and this surface patch is larger than with the holo form. This difference could be explained by the increased flexibility of the apoLACwhich is in its molten globule state at the working temperature (45 °C). In order to know how proteins interact on an atom-to-atom basis, docking experiments were performed using the HADDOCK program. The interacting amino-acids were transformed into ambiguous intermolecular distance restraints to calculate hetero-dimers structures. This characterization is a prerequisite for the use of LAC and LYS micro-spheres as biomaterials, such as bioactive compound carrier. These findings give key elements to understand protein interaction and self-assembly process in mixed system...|$|E
