Thalidomide has been demonstrated to suppress TNF-alpha production in monocytes in vitro and to normalize elevated TNF-alpha levels in vivo. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with cancer cachexia showed the drug was well tolerated and effective at <b>attenuating</b> <b>loss</b> of weight and lean body mass (LBM) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. An improvement in the LBM and improved quality of life were also observed in a randomized, double-blind trial using a protein and energy-dense, omega-3 fatty acids-enriched oral supplement, provided its consumption was equal or superior to 2.2 g of eicosapentaenoic acid per day. It is also through decreasing TNF-alpha production. However, data arising from a large, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial indicate EPA administration alone is not successful in the treatment of weight loss in patients with advanced gastrointestinal or lung cancer.|$|E
40|$|Across many equestrian {{disciplines}} {{the median}} competition career {{of a horse}} is relatively short. One of the major reasons for short career length is musculoskeletal injury and a consistent variable is the trainer effect. There are significant opportunities within equestrian sport for a holistic approach to horse health to attenuate musculoskeletal injury. Proactive integration of care by health professionals could provide a mechanism to attenuate injury risk and the trainer effect. However, the limited data available on current exercise regimens for sport horses restricts interpretation of how management and exercise volume could be modified to reduce injury risk. Early exercise in the juvenile horse (i. e., pre weaning) has {{a positive effect on}} stimulating the musculoskeletal system and primes the horse for an athletic career. The early introduction to sport competition has also been identified to {{have a positive effect on}} career length. These data indicate that management systems reflecting the cursorial evolution of the horse may aid in <b>attenuating</b> <b>loss</b> from sport due to musculoskeletal injury...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Loss of {{skeletal}} muscle {{is the most}} debilitating feature of cancer cachexia, and there are few treatments available. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the anticatabolic efficacy of L-leucine and the leucine metabolite β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (Ca-HMB) on muscle protein metabolism, both invitro and invivo. Methods: Studies were conducted in mice bearing the cachexia-inducing murine adenocarcinoma 16 tumor, and in murine C 2 C 12 myotubes exposed to proteolysis-inducing factor, lipopolysaccharide, and angiotensin II. Results: Both leucine and HMB were found to attenuate the increase in protein degradation and the decrease in protein synthesis in murine myotubes induced by proteolysis-inducing factor, lipopolysaccharide, and angiotensin II. However, HMB was more potent than leucine, because HMB at 50 μM produced essentially the same effect as leucine at 1 mM. Both leucine and HMB reduced the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as measured by the functional (chymotrypsin-like) enzyme activity of the proteasome in muscle lysates, as well as Western blot quantitation of protein levels of the structural/enzymatic proteasome subunits (20 S and 19 S) and the ubiquitin ligases (MuRF 1 and MAFbx). Invivo studies in mice bearing the murine adenocarcinoma 16 tumor showed a low dose of Ca-HMB (0. 25 g/kg) tobe 60 % more effective than leucine (1 g/kg) in <b>attenuating</b> <b>loss</b> of body weight over a 4 -d period.

40|$|Functional {{ability is}} often {{impaired}} {{for people with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA), rendering these patients highly sedentary. Additionally, patients with RA often take medication known to negatively affect bone mass. Thus improving functional ability and bone health in this group of patients is important. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of whole body vibration (WBV) therapy in patients with stable, established RA. Thirty one females with RA were randomly assigned to a control group (CON, n = 15) who continued with their normal activities or a WBV group (n = 16) who underwent a three month WBV therapy intervention, consisting of 15 minutes of intermittent vibration, performed twice per week. Patients were assessed at baseline, three months, and three months post intervention for functional ability using the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire; for RA disease activity using the Clinical Disease Activity Index, for quality of life using self-report fatigue and pain scores; for physical activity profiles using accelerometry, and for BMD and body composition using DXA. Patients in both groups were matched for all variables at baseline. After the intervention period, functional ability was significantly improved in the WBV group (1. 22 (0. 19) to 0. 92 (0. 19), p = 0. 02). Hip BMD was significantly reduced in the CON group (0. 97 (0. 05) to 0. 84 (0. 05) g. cm- 2, p = 0. 01), while no decreases were seen in the WBV group (1. 01 (0. 05) to 0. 94 (0. 05) g. cm- 2, p = 0. 50). Despite no change in RA disease activity in either group at either follow up, fatigue levels were improved in the WBV group (4. 4 (0. 63) to 1. 1 (0. 65), yet remained unchanged in the CON group at both follow ups (p = 0. 01). Ten minute bouts of light to moderate physical activity were significantly reduced in the CON group after the intervention (2. 8 (0. 61) to 1. 8 (0. 64) bouts per day, p = 0. 01), and were preserved in the WBV group (3. 1 (0. 59) to 3. 0 (0. 61) bouts per day, p = 0. 70). Intermittent WBV shows promise for sustained improvements in functional ability, for <b>attenuating</b> <b>loss</b> of bone mass at the hip, as well as for decreasing fatigue in patients with established RA.

To test the contribution of DA to SN impairment in vivo, we used DA-deficient mice, which lack the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase in dopaminergic cells, and mice pharmacologically depleted of DA by �-methyl-ptyrosine pretreatment.

Abnormal mitochondrial motility and mitochondrial dysfunction within axons are critical for amyloid b (Ab) -induced synaptic stress and the loss of synapses relevant to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the mechanisms controlling axonal mitochondrial function and transport alterations in AD remain elusive. Here, we report an unexplored role of cyclophilin D (CypD) -dependent mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) in Ab-impaired axonal mitochondrial trafficking. Depletion of CypD significantly protects axonal mitochondrial motility and dynamics from Ab toxicity as shown by increased axonal mitochondrial density and distribution and improved bidirectional transport of axonal mitochondria. Notably, blockade of mPTP by genetic deletion of CypD suppresses Ab-mediated activation of the p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, reverses axonal mitochondrial abnormalities, improves synaptic function, and <b>attenuates</b> <b>loss</b> of synapse, suggesting a role of CypD-dependent signaling in Ab-induced alterations in axonal mitochondrial trafficking. The potential mechanisms of the protective effects of lacking CypD on Ab-induced abnormal mitochondrial transport in axon are increased axonal calcium buffer capability, diminished reactive oxygen species (ROS), and suppressing downstream signal transduction P 38 activation.

Participants either undertook 6 months of low-load very high-repetition resistance training in the form of BodyPump™ or served as control participants.

Significant group-by-time interactions were found for lumbar spine BMD and maximal strength in favor of the BodyPump™ group. No favorable effects were found for hip BMD, total body BMD, total fat mass, or fat-free soft tissue mass. Three participants withdrew from the intervention group due to injury or fear of injury associated with training. Under the conditions used in this research, low-load very high-repetition resistance training is effective at <b>attenuating</b> <b>losses</b> in lumbar spine BMD compared to controls in healthy, active women aged over 55 years but did not influence hip and total body BMD or fat mass and fat-free soft tissue mass...|$|R

Additional studies were identified through searches of bibliographies. Studies included those comparing PTH peptides with placebo, with anti-osteoporotic treatments and in combination therapies. Participants had to be postmenopausal women and outcomes included areal or volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) and measurements of bone microarchitecture at peripheral sites, such as the forearm and tibia. Data were extracted independently and reviewed by EMcC and LMM. Data on study design were also collected for methodological risk of bias assessment. The heterogeneity between studies, regarding the drug dose and duration, and the site measured, prevented grouped meta-analysis.

Although many studies have demonstrated the cytotoxic effects of ZEN, the mechanisms by which ZEN mediates its cytotoxic effects appear to differ according to cell type and route of exposure. Meantime, the available information on the neurotoxic effects of ZEN is very much limited. In the present study we evaluated the role of oxidative stress in ZEN mediated neurotoxicity in SH-SY 5 Y cells and investigated the possible underlying mechanism. ZEN induced ROS formation and elevated levels of MDA, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and increase in DNA damage in a dose dependent manner as assessed by COMET assay and agarose gel electrophoresis. However, there was no DNA damage by plasmid breakage assay at 6, 12 and 24 h time points. DAPI staining showed apoptotic nuclei at 12 and 24 h.

Given {{the importance of}} the transcriptional regulator hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 (HIF- 1) for adaptive hypoxia responses, we hypothesized that HIF- 1 may serve as a barrier-protective element during mucosal inflammation. Initial studies of hapten-based murine colitis revealed extensive mucosal hypoxia and concomitant HIF- 1 activation during colitis. To study this in more detail, we generated 2 mouse lines with intestinal epithelium–targeted expression of either mutant Hif 1 a (inability to form HIF- 1) or mutant von Hippel-Lindau gene (Vhlh; constitutively active HIF- 1). Studies of colitis in these mice revealed that decreased HIF- 1 expression correlated with more severe clinical symptoms (mortality, weight loss, colon length), while increased HIF levels were protective in these parameters. Furthermore, colons with constitutive activation of HIF displayed increased expression levels of HIF- 1 –regulated barrier-protective genes (multidrug resistance gene- 1, intestinal trefoil factor, CD 73), resulting in <b>attenuated</b> <b>loss</b> of barrier during colitis in vivo.

However, the underlying mechanisms for dendritic Na+ overload and the selective dendritic injury remain poorly understood. Our current study demonstrates that activation of NHE- 1 (Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1) in dendrites presents a major pathway for Na+ overload. Neuronal dendrites exhibited higher pHi regulation rates than soma {{as a result of}} a larger surface area/volume ratio. Following a 2 -h oxygen glucose deprivation and a 1 -h reoxygenation, NHE- 1 activity was increased by ∼ 70 – 200 % in dendrites. This elevation depended on activation of p 90 ribosomal S 6 kinase. Moreover, stimulation of NHE- 1 caused dendritic Na+i accumulation, swelling, and a concurrent loss of Ca 2 +i homeostasis. The Ca 2 +i overload in dendrites preceded the changes in soma. Inhibition of NHE- 1 or the reverse mode of Na+/Ca 2 + exchange prevented these changes. Mitochondrial membrane potential in dendrites depolarized 40 min earlier than soma following oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation.

Phospholipid hydrolysis by phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) after transient cerebral ischemia releases arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid metabolism results in formation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxides, and toxic aldehydes (malondialdehyde, 4 -hydroxynonenal, and acrolein). Citicoline (cytidine- 5 ’-diphosphocholine), an intermediate in phosphatidylcholine synthesis, has undergone 13 phase III clinical trials for stroke, and is being evaluated for treatment of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Here we examined the effect of citicoline on PLA 2 activity in relationship to attenuating hydroxyl radical (OH�) generation and lipid peroxidation after transient forebrain ischemia in gerbil. High Ca 2 + dependency (millimolar range) of PLA 2 activity suggests that secretory PLA 2 is the predominant isoform in membrane and mitochondria. Citicoline attenuated the increase in PLA 2 activity in both membrane and mitochondrial fractions.

We used proteomic analysis to identify RUNX 2 -dependent protein-protein interactions associated with the nuclear matrix in bone, breast and prostate tumor cell types and found that RUNX 2 interacts with three distinct proteins that respond to DNA damage - RUVBL 2, INTS 3 and BAZ 1 B. Subnuclear foci containing these proteins change in intensity or number following UV irradiation. Furthermore, RUNX 2, INTS 3 and BAZ 1 B form UV-responsive complexes with the serine- 139 -phosphorylated isoform of H 2 AX (gammaH 2 AX). UV irradiation increases the interaction of BAZ 1 B with gammaH 2 AX and decreases histone H 3 lysine 9 acetylation levels, which mark accessible chromatin. RUNX 2 depletion prevents the BAZ 1 B-gammaH 2 AX interaction and <b>attenuates</b> <b>loss</b> of H 3 K 9 and H 3 K 56 acetylation. Our data are consistent with a model in which RUNX 2 forms functional complexes with BAZ 1 B, RUVBL 2 and INTS 3 to mount an integrated response to DNA damage. This proposed cytoprotective function for RUNX 2 in cancer cells might clarify its expression in chemotherapy-resistant and/or metastatic tumors...|$|R
40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is a progressive and ultimately fatal skeletal muscle disease. Currently, {{the most effective}} therapy is the administration of a subclass of glucocorticoids, most notably deflazacort. Although deflazacort treatment can attenuate DMD progression, extend ambulation, and maintain muscle strength, the mechanism of its action remains unknown. Prior observations have shown that activation of a JNK 1 -mediated signal transduction cascade contributes to the progression of the DMD phenotype, in part by phosphorylation and inhibition of a calcineurin sensitive NF-ATc 1 transcription factor. Here, we observed that deflazacort treatment restored myocyte viability in muscle cells with constitutive activation of JNK 1 and in dystrophic mdx mice. However, deflazacort treatment did not alter JNK 1 activity itself, but rather led {{to an increase in}} the activity of the calcineurin phosphatase and an up-regulation of NF-ATc 1 -dependent gene expression. The prophylactic effect of deflazacort treatment was associated with increased expression of NF-ATc 1 target genes such as the dystrophin homologue utrophin. Moreover, the muscle sparing effects of deflazacort were completely abolished when used in conjunction with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine. Collectively, these results show that deflazacort <b>attenuates</b> <b>loss</b> of dystrophic myofiber integrity by up-regulating the activity of the phosphatase calcineurin, which in turn negates JNK 1 inhibition of NF-ATc 1 -mediated phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of NF-ATc 1.

30|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of calpain inhibition on ventilator-induced diaphragm atrophy and activation of proteolytic pathways. The main findings of our study can be summarized as follows: (1) calpain inhibitor calpeptin <b>attenuates</b> CMV-induced <b>loss</b> of myosin and CSA in the diaphragm muscle; (2) calpeptin treatment prevents the upregulation of calpain and the increase of calpain cleavage products; (3) calpeptin treatment reduces CMV-induced protein expression of the E 3 -ligases MAFbx and MuRF 1. Collectively, our data indicate that calpain {{play an important role}} in CMV-induced diaphragm atrophy. Moreover, this study shows that inhibition of calpain activation prevents CMV-induced muscle atrophy.|$|R
40|$|The {{roles of}} protein kinase C, Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and AMP-activated protein kinase in the {{phosphorylation}} of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase induced by Ca 2 (+) -mobilizing conditions in isolated hepatocytes were investigated. Only partial {{evidence for the}} involvement of AMP-activated kinase was found. Antagonism of calmodulin action prolonged the decrease in expressed/total activity ratio induced by vasopressin plus glucagon. Protease inhibitors active against Ca 2 (+) -dependent cytosolic proteases or lysosomal proteolysis did not <b>attenuate</b> the <b>loss</b> of total HMG-CoA reductase induced by glucagon plus vasopressin, but calmodulin antagonists largely prevented this effect...|$|R
40|$|A 30 -day 6 deg. head-down {{bed rest}} study was {{conducted}} to evaluate high-intensity, short-duration, alternating isotonic cycle ergometer exercise (ITE) training and high-intensity intermittent isokinetic exercise (IKE) training regiments designed to maintain peak VO 2 and muscle mass, strength, and endurance at ambulatory control levels throughout prolonged bed rest. Other elements of the deconditioning (acclimation) syndrome, such as proprioception, psychological performance, hypovolemia, water balance, body composition, and orthostatic tolerance, were also measured. Compared with response during bed rest of the no exercise (NOE) control group: the ITE training regimen (a) maintained work capacity (peak VO 2), (b) maintained plasma and red cell volume, (c) induced positive body water balance, (d) decreased quality of sleep and mental concentration, and (e) had no effect on the decrease in orthostatic tolerance; the IKE training regimen (a) attenuated the decrease in peak VO 2 by 50 %, (b) <b>attenuated</b> <b>loss</b> of red cell volume by 40 %, but had no effect on loss of plasma volume, (c) induced positive body water balance, (d) had no adverse effect on quality of sleep or concentration, and (e) had no effect on the decrease in orthostatic tolerance. These findings suggest that various elements of the deconditioning syndrome can be manipulated by duration and intensity of ITE or IKE training regiments, and that several different training protocols will be required to maintain or restore physiological and psychological performance of individuals confined to prolonged bed rest...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective:Saphenous vein {{grafting}} {{is associated}} with extensive medial remodeling, characterized by cellular proliferation, loss of smooth muscle cells, and an inflammatory response. In this study, we examined whether unfavorable responses to vein grafting could be modified by the intraoperative application of c-myc antisense oligomers. Methods: The intragraft cell proliferation, macrophage infiltration, and medial preservation were examined in a porcine model in the control and antisense-treated groups (n = 36). Results: Saphenous veins showed transmural distribution of oligomers within 30 minutes of the ex vivo incubation. A concentration-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in the media of saphenous grafts was noted 3 days later (0 to 200 μmol/L,p = 0. 005). The growth inhibition was sequence-specific, because control oligomers produced only insignificant effects (20 μmol/L). Vascular effects of c-myc antisense were associated with a significant attenuation of macrophage infiltration in saphenous grafts. A concentration-dependent decrease in tissue edema (p = 0. 0005) and the <b>attenuated</b> <b>loss</b> of smooth muscle cells (p = 0. 002) were noted in the media of the arterialized venous conduits after c- myc antisense. Conclusions: Direct application of synthetic DNA to harvested saphenous veins resulted in a rapid transmural distribution. The inhibition of the intragraft cell proliferation in vivo after c-myc antisense was sequence dependent. Decrease in vein graft injury resulted in an attenuated inflammatory response and better medial preservation. These findings provide a rationale for assessment of {{the long-term effects of}} vein graft protection with c-myc antisense. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1998; 115; 152 – 61...|$|R
