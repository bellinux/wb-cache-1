5000|$|With {{each new}} {{generation}} of <b>Ambilight</b> products, {{the size of the}} <b>Ambilight</b> system has been reduced to match with the constant reducing thickness and bezel width of flat TVs. The algorithm (the program that translates the displayed picture towards the <b>Ambilight</b> colors) is constantly improved to optimize the effect for all situations. In the latest executions it is possible to correct the <b>Ambilight</b> for non-white (tinted) walls behind the TV.|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>Ambilight</b> was {{developed}} using LED light sources, the first <b>Ambilight</b> TVs (launched in 2004) were equipped with CCFL tubes. The higher {{brightness of the}} CCFL tubes was preferred to make the <b>Ambilight</b> more visible in bright shop environments, {{at the cost of}} a reduced color gamut. Red, green and blue CCFL tubes were mounted at the backside of the cabinet, first at the left and right side but later also at the top and (for wall-hanging applications) bottom side of the screen, reproducing the average screen color. In later executions of <b>Ambilight,</b> the CCFL tubes were replaced by LEDs (2006), resulting in an <b>Ambilight</b> color gamut that matches the picture color gamut. By splitting the <b>Ambilight</b> area in segments of which the color could be individually adapted to the neighboring screen area, the effect of extrapolating the screen on the wall was further improved. To reduce the dark boundary between display and <b>Ambilight</b> area, the “Aurea” TVs were introduced (2007), in which also the bezel of the screen was lighted by the <b>Ambilight</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ambilight</b> creates light effects {{around the}} {{television}} {{that correspond to}} the video content. Philips claims that a [...] "more immersive viewing experience" [...] can result. <b>Ambilight</b> is a lighting system that actively adjusts both brightness and color based upon picture content. Integrated into the television cabinet, <b>Ambilight</b> technology is aimed to enable the viewer to see more picture detail, contrast and color while eliminating on-screen reflections.|$|E
40|$|Smart Grid {{research}} is growing {{around the world}} due {{to the need to}} replace the ageing old electricity grid with an intelligent, reliable electricity network. The smart grid aims at creating a reliable power distribution and efficient power usage in homes. One of the key issues focused in this project is providing real time energy feedback to users, which is minimal or non-existent in the current grid system. This thesis investigates about using smart TVs to provide real time energy feedback in homes. Since its introduction in 2009 smart TVs are growing in popularity in European market. To provide real time energy feedback on smart TVs three features are identified Smart TV application, <b>ambilighting</b> and push notification. The Human-centered design process is used for designing the Smart TV interface system using the identified features. A literature study is conducted to gather the user requirements for the smart TV interface. The information gathered during the study is used for the design and implementation of the interface prototype. As an example platform the Philips smart TV 2013 is chosen to demonstrate the various features {{that can be used to}} provide energy feedback. The usability of the Smart TV interface is evaluated with users and the results are recorded. The smart TV application, ambient lighting and push notification system in Smart TVs is demonstrated for providing real-time energy feedback. The interface is evaluated with users and results are discussed. The result suggests that Smart TVs can serve as an informational display in homes. The Smart TV interface should be interlinked with Smart Phone and Tablet applications to be effective, further the users prefer the Smart Phone over the Smart TV application to control the household devices. The thesis work evaluates the potential of using smart TVs to provide real time energy feedback in homes. The results of the thesis showed that smart phone are the primary interaction medium suitable for home environment while smart TVs can serve as an informative medium to provide ambient feedback in homes. praveenjelish@ymail. com + 4672770078...|$|R

50|$|<b>Ambilight</b> {{technology}} {{works by}} projecting {{light from the}} rear of the TV cabinet in a very wide range of colors, shades and intensities. Viewers can choose to have <b>Ambilight</b> follow the color and brightness of the programme content - automatically changing with the colors on the screen - or alternatively the light levels and color can be set to match the interior decor or mood in the room. When the television is not on, the unit becomes a lamp, capable of displaying dynamic light patterns.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{adapting}} ambient light {{with a video}} display already existed, but proposed solutions required a separate channel for the light effects {{in addition to the}} video and audio channels. <b>Ambilight</b> uses the video channel itself to generate color and the concepts as well as various methods of calculating the color from the video signal are protected by various patents.|$|E
50|$|The soundtrack to Carousel was {{composed}} by Michael Fakesch. The music was altered for the Philips microsite by Stinkdigital so that, if users chose {{to move through}} the film at a different rate or in a different direction, the music would distort to match. Other features of the microsite included an <b>Ambilight</b> feature and the ability to switch at will between 21:9 and 16:9 aspect ratios.|$|E
50|$|The basic Philips <b>Ambilight</b> patent is EP 1379082, {{written by}} Theo Overes of the ASA lab. Other inventors are Aeneas Fletterman (graduate student at ASA lab), and the Philips {{research}} {{team led by}} Elmo Diederiks and Erwin Meinders, consisting of a diverse mix of experts in psychology, user research, software engineering and theatre lighting. Since this basic patent, Philips filed many other patent applications, covering hard and software of the system.|$|E

5000|$|One of Sylvania's heavily-advertised TV {{features}} was {{a lighted}} perimeter mask of adjustable brightness called [...] "HALOLIGHT", which was purported {{to ease the}} optical transition if a viewer glanced from a dark background to the bright TV screen. Today Philips markets an <b>Ambilight</b> feature, lighting the wall behind a flat display to soften the viewing experience. HALOLIGHT could not be adapted for color TV, because color TV white balance (aka tracking from low to high brightness) was unpredictable. Since the white color temperature of the HALOLIGHT and the illuminated color screen could not be made equivalent, HALOLIGHT was withdrawn.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ambilight</b> is {{a feature}} invented in 2002 by the Philips ASA lab (a central {{development}} lab of Philips Consumer Electronics, {{also responsible for}} development of flat TV) and Philips Research, both situated in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. These departments worked in parallel: they started from different starting-points, and ended at comparable technologies. Philips Research investigated the application of LED in the home environment. This development resulted in a lighting system that displayed light according to a program (script) {{that has to be}} generated for all displayed video content, and which should be translated to the used lamp configuration. Movie directors could use a script to add special effects. The system was demonstrated using multiple light units, spread over the room. The starting point of the ASA lab was the wish to add (white) light units to the cabinet of the flat TV. These light units, lighting the wall around the TV, had to replace the table lamp often placed on top of the bulky CRT TVs. This development resulted in a TV lighting system (based on RGB LED) that reproduces the color and brightness of the content displayed on the TV screen. The concept does not require light-scripts, and is backwards compatible with existing video content. Introduction of this concept was less complicated because it only affects the TV itself. This concept was selected for the Philips <b>Ambilight</b> TVs that have been launched since 2004.|$|E
50|$|The IllumiRoom {{concept is}} based on prior work and {{research}} using focus-plus-context screens and projection mapping. The focus-plus-context technology generally uses a high resolution screen surrounded by a lower resolution display. Microsoft's CHI 2013 research paper cites Philips' <b>Ambilight</b> {{as an example of}} a focus-plus-context display. In the case of IllumiRoom, the television represents the high resolution screen and the surrounding projection is the lower resolution display. The purpose of this technology is to provide the user with additional visual information in the visual periphery, both simulating and taking advantage of peripheral vision. While the center of a person's gaze is in high-resolution and is sensitive to color and detail, peripheral vision is less sensitive to color and detail, but highly sensitive to movement.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, imaging {{systems can}} be {{equipped}} with immersive enhancements like 3 D and <b>Ambilight.</b> In this experiment, a demonstrator with {{state of the art}} 3 D technology and pixelated LED based <b>Ambilight</b> was built. The goal of the experiment was to investigate the concepts naturalness, viewing experience, and presence in relation to image quality, depth, and <b>Ambilight.</b> Results show that the concept viewing experience is a nice example of a concept taking into account the quality level of the video as well as enhancements like 3 D and <b>Ambilight.</b> The viewing experience is significantly higher for a set-up with 3 D and <b>Ambilight</b> compared to a set-up without 3 D and without <b>Ambilight.</b> The concept presence takes into account the quality level of the video but to a lesser extend than naturalness and viewing experience. On the other hand, enhancements of depth and <b>Ambilight</b> have a larger effect on presence ratings than on naturalness or viewing experience. Depth and dynamic <b>Ambilight</b> give more sensory information to the viewer which results in a higher sensation of presence...|$|E
40|$|Image {{quality is}} a concept that for long very well served to {{optimize}} display performance and signal quality. New technological developments, however, forced the community to look into higher-level concepts to capture the full experience. Terms as naturalness and viewing experience were used to optimize the full experience of 3 D-displays and <b>Ambilight</b> TV. These higher-level concepts capture differences in image quality and differences in perceived depth or perceived viewing field. With the introduction of solid-state lighting, further enhancing the multimedia experience, yet more advanced quality evaluation concepts to optimize the overall experience will be needed in the future...|$|E
