25|$|Only {{one of the}} two DNA strands {{serve as}} a {{template}} for transcription. The <b>antisense</b> <b>strand</b> of DNA is read by RNA polymerase from the 3' end to the 5' end during transcription (3' → 5'). The complementary RNA is created in the opposite direction, in the 5' → 3' direction, matching the sequence of the sense strand with the exception of switching uracil for thymine. This directionality is because RNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of the growing mRNA chain. This use of only the 3' → 5' DNA strand eliminates the need for the Okazaki fragments that are seen in DNA replication. This also removes the need for an RNA primer to initiate RNA synthesis, {{as is the case in}} DNA replication.|$|E
500|$|In eukaryotes, {{two primary}} models for how {{homologous}} recombination repairs double-strand breaks in DNA are the double-strand break repair (DSBR) pathway (sometimes called the double Holliday junction model) and the synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) pathway. In {{the case of}} double strand breakage, the 3' end is degraded and the longer 5' end invades the contiguous sister chromatid, forming a replication bubble. As this bubble nears the broken DNA, the longer 5' <b>antisense</b> <b>strand</b> again invades the sense strand of this portion of DNA, transcribing a second copy. When replication ends, both tails are reconnected to form two Holliday Junctions, which are then cleaved {{in a variety of}} patterns by proteins. An animation of this process can be seen [...]|$|E
500|$|Exogenous dsRNA initiates RNAi by {{activating}} the ribonuclease protein Dicer, which binds and cleaves double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) in plants, {{or short}} hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in humans, to produce double-stranded fragments of 20–25 base pairs with a 2-nucleotide overhang at the 3' end. Bioinformatics {{studies on the}} genomes of multiple organisms suggest this length maximizes target-gene specificity and minimizes non-specific effects. These short double-stranded fragments are called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These siRNAs are then separated into single strands and integrated into an active RISC, by RISC-Loading Complex (RLC). RLC includes Dicer-2 and R2D2, and is crucial to unite Ago2 and RISC. TATA-binding protein-associated factor 11 (TAF11) assembles the RLC by facilitating Dcr-2-R2D2 tetramerization, which increases the binding affinity to siRNA by 10-fold. Association with TAF11 would convert the R2-D2-Initiator (RDI) complex into the RLC. R2D2 carries tandem double-stranded RNA-binding domains to recognize the thermodynamically stable terminus of siRNA duplexes, whereas Dicer-2 the other less stable extremity. Loading is asymmetric: the MID domain of Ago2 recognizes [...] the thermodynamically stable end of the siRNA. Therefore, the [...] "passenger" [...] (sense) strand whose 5′ end is discarded by MID is ejected, while the saved [...] "guide" [...] (<b>antisense)</b> <b>strand</b> cooperates with AGO to form the RISC.|$|E

5000|$|Knowing the {{difference}} between the sense and <b>antisense</b> <b>strands</b> is important in certain molecular biology applications. For example, in microarray expression technologies, {{it is important to know}} which strand is [...] "viewed" [...] on the array. An array can correspond to either strand; however, a single array will be made entirely of [...] "sense" [...] or [...] "antisense" [...] strands.|$|R
5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and <b>antisense</b> <b>strands</b> by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read {{in the opposite direction}} along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{reported}} method of methylation analysis using bisulfite-treated DNA utilized PCR and standard dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing to directly determine the nucleotides resistant to bisulfite conversion. [...] Primers {{are designed to}} be strand-specific as well as bisulfite-specific (i.e., primers containing non-CpG cytosines such that they are not complementary to non-bisulfite-treated DNA), flanking (but not involving) the methylation site of interest. [...] Therefore, it will amplify both methylated and unmethylated sequences, in contrast to methylation-specific PCR. [...] All sites of unmethylated cytosines are displayed as thymines in the resulting amplified sequence of the sense strand, and as adenines in the amplified <b>antisense</b> <b>strand.</b> [...] This technique required cloning of the PCR product prior to sequencing for adequate sensitivity, and therefore was a very labour-intensive method unsuitable for higher throughput. [...] Alternatively, nested PCR methods can be used to enhance the product for sequencing.|$|E

30|$|Single-stranded DNA can be {{produced}} in a controlled, stepwise manner [1] using commercial DNA synthesisers on solid supports [1, 2]. Once synthesised, the DNA strand is released from the solid support into solution, deprotected and collected (these three steps are usually carried out in aqueous ammonium hydroxide). Side reactions and failure sequences limit the ultimate length of the oligonucleotides to approximately 100 nucleotides.

40|$|AbstractThe {{majority}} of intrinsic rho-independent terminator signals, reported {{to consist of}} stable hairpin structures followed by T-rich regions, possess the potential to operate bi-directionally and to induce transcription terminations on both strands of the DNA duplex in Escherichia coli. By using RNAMotif software, we investigated the distributions of termination motifs around the 3 ′-ends of overlapping and non-overlapping genes at the genomic level. We suggest that the positions of compactly encoded E. coli genes and rho-independent terminators are optimized to terminate the adjoining genes on their <b>antisense</b> <b>strands</b> efficiently, and not to mis-terminate overlapping transcripts, due to their bi-directional properties...|$|R

40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{a biological}} process whereby small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) silence gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. These effectors regulate gene expression through the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). It {{has been suggested}} that RISC preferentially selects and incorporates one of two strands of the siRNA duplex depending on its thermodynamic features and that the off-target effects of siRNAs can be correlated to the Tm of the duplex. The problem of unwanted incorporation of the passenger strand into RISC could be address altering the thermodynamic asymmetry of the duplex by using specific chemical modifications. Structural studies have revealed that the 3 ’-overhang region of the guide strand of siRNA is recognized by the PAZ domain and is accommodated into its hydrophobic binding pocket. We expected that aromatic-based modifications in 3 ’-overhang would enhance RISC selection of <b>antisense</b> <b>strands</b> of siRNA duplexes, reducing off-target effects induced by sense strands. In this study, we report the synthesis of siRNAs bearing diphenylpropylamine, tyramine and tryptamine units at the 3 ’-end of sense and <b>antisense</b> <b>strands.</b> We found thermodynamic stability of the conjugates was increased by these modifications. Furthermore, but not surprisingly, the modified duplexes were found to retain RNA-like A-type conformation. We also assessed the nuclease resistance of the modified siRNAs and found it was similar to those of unmodified siRNAs. These results prompted us to investigate the silencing activity of the siRNAs possessing the aromatic moiety in the 3 ’-end by in vitro experiments in mammalian cells...|$|R
40|$|Elucidating the {{transcribed}} {{regions of}} the genome constitutes a fundamental aspect of human biology, yet this remains an outstanding problem. To comprehensively identify coding sequences, we constructed a series of highdensity oligonucleotide tiling arrays representing sense and <b>antisense</b> <b>strands</b> of the entire nonrepetitive sequence of the human genome. Transcribed sequences were located across the genome via hybridization to complementary DNA samples, reverse-transcribed from polyadenylated RNA obtained from human liver tissue.

By selectively labeling the strands of PCR-amplified DNA, it was shown that the heat denaturation process in combination with the application of low-salt condition substantially reduced the interference from the <b>antisense</b> <b>strands</b> and thus simplified the surface hybridization.

5000|$|Lastly, {{the double}} {{stranded}} miRNAs/siRNAs separate into single strands; the <b>antisense</b> RNA <b>strand</b> {{of the two}} will combine with another endoribonuclease enzyme complex called RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex), which includes the catalytic component Argonaute, and will guide the RISC {{to break up the}} [...] "perfectly complementary" [...] target mRNA or viral genomic RNA {{so that it can be}} destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|In genetics, a sense strand, or coding strand, is {{the segment}} within {{double-stranded}} DNA {{that runs from}} 5' to 3', and which is complementary to the <b>antisense</b> <b>strand</b> of DNA, which runs from 3' to 5'. The sense strand is the strand of DNA that has the same sequence as the mRNA, which takes the <b>antisense</b> <b>strand</b> as its template during transcription, and eventually undergoes (typically, not always) translation into a protein. The <b>antisense</b> <b>strand</b> is thus responsible for the RNA that is later translated to protein, while the sense strand possesses a nearly identical makeup {{to that of the}} mRNA. Note that for each segment of dsDNA, there will possibly be two sets of sense and antisense, depending on which direction one reads (since sense and antisense is relative to perspective). It is ultimately the gene product, or mRNA, that dictates which strand of one segment of dsDNA we call sense or antisense. But keep in mind that sometimes, such as in prokaryotes, overlapping genes on opposite strands means the sense for one mRNA can be the antisense for another mRNA. [...] The immediate product of this transcription is a resultant initial RNA transcript, which contains a sequence of nucleotides that is identical to that of the sense strand. The exception to this is that uracil is used for nucleotide sequencing of RNA molecules rather than thymine.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{template}} {{design for}} single-molecule sequencing is introduced, a structure {{we refer to}} as a SMRTbell TM template.

When placed into a single-molecule sequencing reaction, the SMRTbell template format enables a consensus sequence to be obtained from multiple passes on a single molecule. Furthermore, this consensus sequence is obtained from both the sense and <b>antisense</b> <b>strands</b> of the insert region. In this article, we present a universal method for constructing these templates, as well as an application of their use.

40|$|RNA is {{involved}} in a variety of chromatin modification events, ranging from large-scale structural rearrangements to subtle local affects. Here, we extend the evidence for RNA–chromatin interactions to the centromere core. The data indicate that maize centromeric retrotransposons (CRMs) and satellite repeats (CentC) are not only transcribed, but that nearly half of the CRM and CentC RNA is tightly bound to centromeric histone H 3 (CENH 3), a key inner kinetochore protein.

5000|$|The two {{complementary}} {{strands of}} double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) are usually differentiated as the [...] "sense" [...] strand and the [...] "antisense" [...] strand. The DNA sense strand {{looks like the}} messenger RNA (mRNA) {{and can be used}} to read the expected protein code; for example, ATG in the sense DNA may correspond to an AUG codon in the mRNA, encoding the amino acid methionine. However, the DNA sense strand itself is not used to make protein by the cell. It is the DNA <b>antisense</b> <b>strand</b> which serves as the source for the protein code, because, with bases complementary to the DNA sense strand, it is used as a template for the mRNA. Since transcription results in an RNA product complementary to the DNA template strand, the mRNA is complementary to the DNA <b>antisense</b> <b>strand.</b> The mRNA is what is used for translation (protein synthesis).Hence, a base triplet 3'-TAC-5' in the DNA <b>antisense</b> <b>strand</b> {{can be used as a}} template which will result in an 5'-AUG-3' base triplet in mRNA (AUG is the codon for methionine, the start codon). The DNA sense strand will have the triplet ATG, which looks just like AUG but will not be used to make methionine because it will not be used to make mRNA. The DNA sense strand is called a [...] "sense" [...] strand not because it will be used to make protein (it won't be), but because it has a sequence that looks like the protein codon sequence.|$|E
