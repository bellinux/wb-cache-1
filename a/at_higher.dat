5|$|Both NAD and NADH {{strongly}} absorb {{ultraviolet light}} {{because of the}} adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD is at a wavelength of 259nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220M−1cm−1. This difference in the ultraviolet absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays– by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340nm using a spectrophotometer.|$|E

5|$|Lithium's {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion is {{twice that of}} aluminium and almost four times that of iron. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations.

At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures.|$|E

The apparent anomaly that propagation rate coefficients deduced from bulk and emulsion systems <b>at</b> <b>high</b> conversion are greatly different actually arises because the initiator efficiency {{in the former}} is very low.

Modelling the reaction-diffusion equations <b>at</b> <b>high</b> conversion (including new theory to account for polymer migration) shows that large (say, > 200 nm radius) particles <b>at</b> <b>high</b> conversion will show strong spatial inhomogeneity (core-shell structure) even in emulsion homopolymerizations, because of the slow diffusion of monomer and free radicals...|$|R

40|$|Retrotransposition of the Ty 1 {{element of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae is {{temperature}} sensitive. Transposition activity of Ty 1 is abolished at temperatures above 34 °C. In this report, {{we show that}} the major block to transposition <b>at</b> <b>high</b> temperature is the inhibition of processing of the Gag-Pol-p 199 polyprotein and the concomitant reduction of reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. Expression of a Ty 1 protease construct in Escherichia coli shows that protease enzymatic activity is inherently temperature sensitive. In yeast, Gag processing is only partially inhibited <b>at</b> <b>high</b> temperature, while cleavage of the Gag-Pol polyprotein is completely inhibited. Sites of proteolytic processing are differentially susceptible to cleavage during growth <b>at</b> <b>high</b> temperature. Overall levels of the Gag-Pol polyprotein are reduced <b>at</b> <b>high</b> temperature, although {{the efficiency of the}} requisite + 1 frameshifting event appears to be increased. RT activity is inherently relatively temperature resistant, yet no cDNA is made <b>at</b> <b>high</b> temperature and the amount of RT activity is greatly reduced in virus-like particles formed <b>at</b> <b>high</b> temperature. Taken together, these results suggest that alterations in Ty 1 proteins that occur <b>at</b> <b>high</b> temperature affect both protease activity and RT activity, such that Ty 1 transposition is abolished...|$|R
