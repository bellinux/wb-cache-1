5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, there were discussions towards {{reviving}} Thespis, but Gilbert and Sullivan {{were not able to}} agree on terms with Carte and his backers. The score to Thespis was never published, and most of the music is now lost. It took some time for Carte to gather funds for another Gilbert and Sullivan opera, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> gap Gilbert produced several works including Tom Cobb (1875), Eyes and No Eyes (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and Princess Toto (1876), his last and most ambitious work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that came before. Gilbert also wrote two serious works during this time, Broken Hearts (1875) and Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith (1876).|$|E
5|$|After Áed's death, {{there is}} a two-decade gap until the death of DonaldII (Domnall mac Constantín) in 900 during which nothing is {{reported}} in the Irish annals. The entry for the reign between Áed and DonaldII is corrupt in the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case the Chronicle is at variance with every other king list. According to the Chronicle, Áed was followed by Eochaid, a grandson of Kenneth MacAlpin, who is somehow connected with Giric, but all other lists say that Giric ruled after Áed and make great claims for him. Giric is not {{known to have been}} a kinsman of Kenneth's, although {{it has been suggested that}} he was related to him by marriage. The major changes in Pictland which began at about this time have been associated by Alex Woolf and Archie Duncan with Giric's reign.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{operation}} was mounted too late to prevent the attacks on Saigon, the Australians and New Zealanders successfully disrupted the communist lines of communication, limiting their freedom of manoeuvre to attack the Long Binh–Bien Hoa complex, while they were also able to successfully interdict their withdrawal, causing heavy casualties. The operation was also significant {{as it was the}} first deployment of 1 ATF outside its Tactical Area of Responsibility (TAOR) in Phuoc Tuy, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> it set a precedent for later operations outside the province. Meanwhile, the remaining Australian forces in Phuoc Tuy Province also successfully repelled repeated Viet Cong attacks against Ba Ria and Long Dien, as part of the Tet Offensive that had engulfed population centres across South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun {{began his}} {{political}} career in the House of Representatives. As a prominent leader of the war hawk faction, Calhoun strongly supported the War of 1812 to defend American honor against British infractions of American independence and neutrality during the Napoleonic Wars. He then served as Secretary of War under President James Monroe, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> position reorganized and modernized the War Department. Calhoun was {{a candidate for the}} presidency in the 1824 election. After failing to gain support, he let his name be put forth as a candidate for vice president. The Electoral College elected Calhoun for vice president by an overwhelming majority. He served under John Quincy Adams and continued under Andrew Jackson, who defeated Adams in the election of 1828.|$|E
5|$|Current glaciers cover an area 1,375 {{square miles}} (3,560km2) and {{accounts}} for 27% of the Park area. Up {{until the early}} 1700s the area was a large single glacier of solid ice. It has since retreated and evolved into the largest protected water area park in the world. Glacier Bay, on the Gulf of Alaska, {{was known as the}} Grand Pacific Glacier, about 4,000 feet (1,200 m) thick and around 20 miles (32km) in width. Over the last 200 years the glaciers have retreated, exposing 65 miles (105km) of ocean, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> process left 20 separate other glaciers in its trail. In 1890, the name “Glacier Bay” as such was given to the bay by Captain Lester A. Beardslee of the U.S. Navy. It was first proclaimed a U.S. National Monument on February 25, 1925, by President Calvin Coolidge.|$|E

5|$|Deployed in India, Nolan was {{eventually}} made the regimental riding master and an aide-de-camp to General George Berkeley, commander-in-chief in Madras, accompanying him on horse trials {{to evaluate the}} use of geldings as cavalry mounts rather than stallions, and was made a Captain in 1850. Returning to Great Britain in 1851, he toured continental Europe and wrote two books on horsemanship and cavalry theory, the second of which, Cavalry: Its History and Tactics, was universally acclaimed and led to the adoption of a Nolan-designed saddle by the British Army. A trusted voice on cavalry matters, Nolan was dispatched to the Middle East {{in the early days of}} the Crimean War to hunt for appropriate mounts. After returning he was attached to the staff of General Richard Airey, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> role delivered the order that led to the Charge of the Light Brigade.|$|E
5|$|During the American {{retreat from}} Quebec, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> battle, wounded {{soldiers}} were treated at the Ursuline convent in Trois-Rivières.

On July 4, 2009, during festivities marking the town's 375th anniversary, American Consul-General David Fetter symbolically repaid the debt to the Ursulines with a payment of C$130.|$|E
5|$|Each legion was {{normally}} {{partnered with}} an approximately {{equal number of}} allied (non-Roman) auxiliae troops. The addition of allied troops to the Roman army was a formalisation of the earlier arrangement of using light troops from the Socii and Latini, who had received Roman citizenship after the Social War. Auxiliary troops could be formed from either auxiliary light cavalry known as alae, auxiliary light infantry known as cohors auxiliae, or a flexible mixture of the two known as cohors equitata. Cavalry types included mounted archers (Latin: sagittarii) and heavy shock cavalry (Latin: cataphracti or clibanarii). Infantry could be armed with bows, slings, throwing spears, long swords, or thrusting spears. Auxiliary units were originally led by their own chiefs, <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period, their internal organisation was left to their commanders.|$|E

5|$|If {{the latter}} {{suggestion}} is correct, then Thored's {{first appearance in}} history is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recension D (EF)'s entry for 966, which recorded the accession of Oslac to the ealdormanry of southern Northumbria: In this year, Thored, Gunnar's son, harried Westmoringa land, <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> same year, Oslac succeeded {{to the office of}} ealdorman. The Anglo-Saxon scholar Frank Stenton believed that this was an act of regional faction-fighting, rather than, as had been suggested by others, Thored carrying out the orders of King Edgar the Peaceable. This entry is, incidentally, the first mention of Westmoringa land, that is, Westmorland. Gunnar seems to have been ealdorman earlier in the decade, for in one charter (surviving only in a later cartulary) dated to 963 and three Abingdon charters dated to 965, an ealdorman (dux) called Gunnar is mentioned.|$|E

Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed Oryzomys from western Mexico in 2009 <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> context provided an extended diagnosis of Oryzomys. They recognized eight species: the six previously mentioned plus O.albiventer and O.peninsulae. Also in 2009, Robert Voss and Weksler identified the subfossil Oryzomys curasoae from Curaçao as an island population of O.gorgasi. The next year, Delton Hanson and colleagues published a study using DNA sequence data from the cytochrome b, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, and alcohol dehydrogenase 1 genes to assess relationships within Oryzomys. They recommended that the marsh rice rat be split into two species and that O.couesi be split into four species {{on the basis of}} the observed sequence divergence and other data.|$|E
