5|$|<b>Arteriovenous</b> malformations (AVMs, larger {{vascular}} malformations) {{occur in}} larger organs, predominantly the lungs (50%), liver (30–70%) {{and the brain}} (cerebral AVMs, 10%), with a very small proportion (<1%) having AVMs in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|It {{may lead}} to nosebleeds, acute and chronic {{digestive}} tract bleeding, and various problems due to the involvement of other organs. Treatment focuses on reducing bleeding from blood vessel lesions, and sometimes surgery or other targeted interventions to remove <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations in organs. Chronic bleeding often requires iron supplements and sometimes blood transfusions. HHT is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, and occurs in one in 5,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Telangiectasias and <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations in HHT {{are thought}} to arise because of changes in angiogenesis, the {{development}} of blood vessels out of existing ones. The {{development of a new}} blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly endothelium, smooth muscle and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias is unusually friable, which explains the tendency of these lesions to bleed.|$|E
5|$|In 15–20 {{percent of}} cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, no aneurysm is detected on the first angiogram. About half of these are attributed to non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, in which the blood {{is limited to the}} subarachnoid spaces around the midbrain (i.e. mesencephalon). In these, the origin of the blood is uncertain. The remainder are due to other disorders affecting the blood vessels (such as cerebral <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations), disorders of the blood vessels in the spinal cord, and bleeding into various tumors. Cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia (usually in children) and, rarely, anticoagulant therapy, problems with blood clotting and pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH. Dissection of the vertebral artery, usually caused by trauma, can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if the dissection involves the part of the vessel inside the skull.|$|E
5|$|Brain AVMs may be {{detected}} on computed tomography angiography (CTA or CT angio) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA); CTA is better in showing the vessels themselves, and MRA provides more {{detail about the}} relationship between an AVM and surrounding brain tissue. In general, MRI is recommended. Various types of vascular malformations may be encountered: AVMs, micro-AVMs, telangiectasias and <b>arteriovenous</b> fistulas. If surgery, embolization, or other treatment is contemplated (see below), cerebral angiography may be required to get sufficient detail of the vessels. This procedure carries a small risk of stroke (0.5%) and is therefore limited to specific circumstances. Recent professional guidelines recommend that all children with suspected or definite HHT undergo a brain MRI early in life to identify AVMs that can cause major complications. Others suggest that screening for cerebral AVMs is probably unnecessary in those who are not experiencing any neurological symptoms, because most lesions discovered on screening scans would not require treatment, creating undesirable conundrums.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a number of other {{conditions}} including tumors, strokes, head trauma, previous infections of the central nervous system, genetic abnormalities, and as a result of brain damage around the time of birth. Of those with brain tumors, almost 30% have epilepsy, making them the cause of about 4% of cases. The risk is greatest for tumors in the temporal lobe and those that grow slowly. Other mass lesions such as cerebral cavernous malformations and <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations have risks as high as 4060%. Of those who have had a stroke, 2–4% develop epilepsy. In the United Kingdom strokes account for 15% of cases and it is believed to be the cause in 30% of the elderly. Between 6 and 20% of epilepsy is believed to be due to head trauma. Mild brain injury increases the risk about two-fold while severe brain injury increases the risk seven-fold. In those who have experienced a high-powered gunshot wound to the head, the risk is about 50%.|$|E

25|$|Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome, {{also known}} as Wyburn-Mason syndrome, is a rare congential <b>arteriovenous</b> {{malformation}} of the brain, retina or facial nevi. The syndrome {{has a number of}} possible symptoms and can affect the skin, bones, kidneys, muscles, and gastrointestinal tract. When the syndrome affects the brain, people can experience severe headaches, seizures, acute stroke, meningism and progressive neurological deficits due to acute or chronic ischaemia caused by <b>arteriovenous</b> shunting.|$|E
25|$|Stereotactic {{surgery and}} radiosurgery: PET-image guided surgery {{facilitates}} treatment of intracranial tumors, <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations and other surgically treatable conditions.|$|E
25|$|Another {{indication}} for neuroimaging is CT-, MRI- and PET-guided stereotactic {{surgery or}} radiosurgery {{for treatment of}} intracranial tumors, <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations and other surgically treatable conditions.|$|E
25|$|Hemorrhagic strokes {{may occur}} on the {{background}} of alterations to the {{blood vessels in the}} brain, such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral <b>arteriovenous</b> malformation and an intracranial aneurysm, which can cause intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|An {{anastomosis}} (plural anastomoses) is {{a connection}} or opening between two things (especially cavities or passages) that are normally diverging or branching, such as between blood vessels, leaf veins, or streams. Such a connection may be normal (such as the foramen ovale in a fetus's heart) or abnormal (such as the patent foramen ovale in an adult's heart); it may be acquired (such as an <b>arteriovenous</b> fistula) or innate (such as the <b>arteriovenous</b> shunt of a metarteriole); {{and it may be}} natural (such as the aforementioned examples) or artificial (such as a surgical anastomosis). The reestablishment of an anastomosis that had become blocked is called a reanastomosis. Anastomoses that are abnormal, whether congenital or acquired, are often called fistulas.|$|E
25|$|Incidence {{rates are}} {{two to three}} times higher in males, while there are more large and giant aneurysms and fewer {{multiple}} aneurysms. Intracranial hemorrhages are 1.6 {{times more likely to be}} due to aneurysms than cerebral <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations in whites, but four times less in certain Asian populations.|$|E
25|$|Subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} (SAH) {{implies the}} presence of blood within the subarachnoid space from some pathologic process. The common medical {{use of the term}} SAH refers to the nontraumatic types of hemorrhages, usually from rupture of a berry aneurysm or <b>arteriovenous</b> malformation(AVM). The scope of this article is limited to these nontraumatic hemorrhages.|$|E
25|$|Musical {{hallucinations}} {{are also}} relatively common {{in terms of}} complex auditory hallucinations and {{may be the result}} of a wide range of causes ranging from hearing-loss (such as in musical ear syndrome, the auditory version of Charles Bonnet syndrome), lateral temporal lobe epilepsy, <b>arteriovenous</b> malformation, stroke, lesion, abscess, or tumor.|$|E
25|$|The {{syndrome}} is a congenital disorder that begins to develop around the seventh {{week of gestation}} when the maturation of retinal mesenchymal cells do not properly grow. The abnormal development of vascular tissue leads to <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations. These malformations affect both the visual and cerebral structures and {{lead to the development}} of the syndrome.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{examinations}} {{can be used}} {{to determine the extent of}} the syndrome and its severity. Fluorescein angiography is quite useful in diagnosing the disease, and the use of ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are helpful in confirming the disease. Neuro-ophthalmic examinations reveal pupillary defects (see Marcus Gunn Pupil). Funduscopic examinations, examinations of the fundus of the eye, allow detection of <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations. Neurological examinations can determine hemiparesis and paresthesias. Malformations in <b>arteriovenous</b> connections and irregular functions in the veins may be distinguished by fluorescein angiographies. Cerebral angiography examinations may expose AVMs in the cerebrum. MRIs are also used in imaging the brain and can allow visualization of the optic nerve and any possible atrophy. MRI, CT, and cerebral angiography are all useful for investigating the extent and location of any vascular lesions that are affecting the brain. This is helpful in determining the extent of the syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{syndrome}} {{was first}} described in 1943 and {{believed to be}} associated with racemose hemangiomatosis of the retina and <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations of the brain. It is non-hereditary and belongs to phakomatoses that do not have a cutaneous (pertaining to the skin) involvement. This syndrome can affect the retina, brain, skin, bones, kidney, muscles, and the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
25|$|Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc {{syndrome}} results {{mainly from}} <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations. These malformations are addressed previously in the article, under “Signs and Symptoms.” Due {{to lack of}} research, {{it is difficult to}} provide a specific mechanism for this disorder. However, a number of examinations, mentioned under “Diagnosis,” can be performed on subjects to investigate the disorder and severity of the AVMs.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} {{that result from}} Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome vary from case to case. A person showing signs of the syndrome may display faint skin discoloration, nevi and angiomas of the skin. Some patients with this disorder also present with high flow <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations of the maxillofacial or mandibular (jaw) regions. Another facial indicator of this disease is malformations affecting the frontal and/or maxillary sinuses.|$|E
25|$|Working at the Royal Society in the 1660s, the {{physician}} Richard Lower began examining {{the effects of}} changes in blood volume on circulatory function and developed methods for cross-circulatory study in animals, obviating clotting by closed <b>arteriovenous</b> connections. The new instruments {{he was able to}} devise enabled him to perform the first reliably documented successful transfusion of blood in front of his distinguished colleagues from the Royal Society.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) features/symptoms of Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc {{syndrome}} is highly dependent of the location of the cerebral AVMs and the {{extent of the}} malformation. The most common symptom affecting the CNS is an intracranial hemangioma in the midbrain. Along with hemangiomas, the malformations result in severe headaches, cerebral hemorrhages, vomiting, meningism, seizures, acute strokes or progressive neurological deficits due to acute or chronic ischaemia caused by <b>arteriovenous</b> shunting.|$|E
25|$|Glucostatic hypothesis: The {{activity}} of the satiety center in the ventromedial nuclei is probably governed by the glucose utilization in the neurons. It has been postulated that when their glucose utilization is low and consequently when the <b>arteriovenous</b> blood glucose difference across them is low, the activity across the neurons decrease. Under these conditions, the {{activity of}} the feeding center is unchecked and the individual feels hungry. Food intake is rapidly increased by intraventricular administration of 2-deoxyglucose therefore decreasing glucose utilization in cells.|$|E
25|$|Montalbán {{was born}} on November 25, 1920, in Mexico City {{and grew up in}} Torreón, the son of Spanish {{immigrants}} Ricarda Merino Jiménez and Genaro Balbino Montalbán Busano, a store manager, who raised him as a Roman Catholic. He was born with an <b>arteriovenous</b> malformation (AVM) in his spine. Montalbán had a sister, Carmen, and two brothers, Pedro and Carlos. As a teenager, he moved to Los Angeles to live with Carlos. They moved to New York City in 1940, and Montalbán earned a minor role in the play Her Cardboard Lover.|$|E
25|$|Various organic {{diseases}} {{may cause}} parosmias (distortion {{of the sense}} of smell). Also, since smell and taste are intimately linked senses, disorders of gustation (e.g. dysgeusia- taste dysfunction) can present as a complaint related to smell, and vice versa. These conditions, collectively termed chemosensory dysfunctions, are many and varied, and they may trigger a person to complain of an odor than is not present, however the diagnostic criteria for ORS require the exclusion of any such causes. They include pathology of the right hemisphere of the brain, substance abuse, <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations in the brain, and temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|In South Dakota, Senator Tim Johnson's {{seat was}} {{considered}} a top GOP target in 2008, considering Johnson's narrow 524-vote victory in 2002 over then-Representative and current U.S. Senator John Thune, {{as well as his}} recent health problems. Johnson underwent surgery in December 2006 for a cerebral <b>arteriovenous</b> malformation and was discharged from the hospital on April 30, 2007. On October 19, 2007, Johnson formally announced that he is seeking re-election. According to a November 2006 SurveyUSA poll, Johnson has an approval rating of 70%, with just 26% disapproving of his performance, making him an early favorite despite the state's Republican leaning.|$|E
25|$|During {{the filming}} of the film Across the Wide Missouri (1951), Montalbán was thrown from his horse, knocked unconscious, and trampled by another horse, which aggravated his <b>arteriovenous</b> {{malformation}} and resulted in a traumatic back injury that never healed. The pain increased as he aged, and in 1993, he underwent over nine hours of spinal surgery that left him paralyzed below the waist and requiring {{the use of a}} wheelchair. Despite constant pain, he continued to perform, providing voices for animated films and supporting his Nosotros foundation. Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez created a role in his Spy Kids film series specifically for Montalbán, which included the use of a jet-propelled wheelchair.|$|E
25|$|It {{generally}} {{occurs in}} small arteries or arterioles and is commonly due to hypertension, intracranial vascular malformations (including cavernous angiomas or <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations), cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or infarcts into which secondary hemorrhage has occurred. Other potential causes are trauma, bleeding disorders, amyloid angiopathy, {{illicit drug use}} (e.g., amphetamines or cocaine). The hematoma enlarges until pressure from surrounding tissue limits its growth, or until it decompresses by emptying into the ventricular system, CSF or the pial surface. A third of intracerebral bleed is into the brain's ventricles. ICH has a mortality rate of 44 percent after 30 days, higher than ischemic stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage (which technically may also be classified {{as a type of}} stroke).|$|E
25|$|MRI is {{the investigative}} tool {{of choice for}} {{neurological}} cancers, as it has better resolution than CT and offers better visualization of the posterior fossa. The contrast provided between grey and white matter makes MRI {{the best choice for}} many conditions of the central nervous system, including demyelinating diseases, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, infectious diseases, and epilepsy. Since many images are taken milliseconds apart, it shows how the brain responds to different stimuli, enabling researchers to study both the functional and structural brain abnormalities in psychological disorders. MRI also is used in mri-guided stereotactic surgery and radiosurgery for treatment of intracranial tumors, <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations, and other surgically treatable conditions using a device known as the N-localizer.|$|E
25|$|Discrete {{localized}} enlargements {{of normal}} structures (ureters, blood vessels, intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ducts, pulmonary inclusions, or gastrointestinal duplications) due to outflow obstructions or narrowings, or abnormal connections, may also present as a tumor. Examples are <b>arteriovenous</b> fistulae or aneurysms (with or without thrombosis), biliary fistulae or aneurysms, sclerosing cholangitis, cysticercosis or hydatid cysts, intestinal duplications, and pulmonary inclusions as seen with cystic fibrosis. It {{can be dangerous}} to biopsy a number of types of tumor in which the leakage of their contents would potentially be catastrophic. When such types of tumors are encountered, diagnostic modalities such as ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, angiograms, and nuclear medicine scans are employed prior to (or during) biopsy or surgical exploration/excision {{in an attempt to}} avoid such severe complications.|$|E
25|$|Hopkins {{continued}} {{his career as}} a session and touring musician with a variety of acts, including Jefferson Airplane, the Rolling Stones (most notably on Exile on Main St. and the group's ensuing 1972 American tour), the Jerry Garcia Band and Joe Cocker. He died in September 1994 from complications resulting from intestinal surgery related to his lifelong battle with Crohn's disease. In the 1980s, he joined the controversial Church of Scientology and credited the organization's Purification Rundown with vanquishing his long struggle with substance abuse. Valenti underwent brain surgery for an <b>arteriovenous</b> malformation in the late 1980s; despite suffering from short-term memory loss and struggling with the adverse effects of anti-convulsive medications, he continued to write songs and perform with various Marin County musicians until his sudden death in November 1994.|$|E
25|$|The {{ophthalmic}} {{features of}} the Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome occur as retinal <b>arteriovenous</b> malformation (AVMs). There are three categories of AVMs that are categorized depending on {{the severity of the}} malformation. The first category consists of the patient having small lesions that usually are asymptomatic. The second category, more severe than the first, is when the patient’s malformation is missing a connecting capillary. The missing capillary is meant to serve as a link between an artery and a vein; without it, edemas, hemorrhages, and visual impairments can result. Category three, the most severe, occurs when the patient’s malformations are so severe that the dilated vessels cause no distinction between artery and vein. When the symptoms are this severe, the patient has a significantly increased risk of developing vision loss. Since the retinal lesions categorized vary from large vascular malformations that affect a majority of the retina to malformations that are barely visible, the lesions cause a wide range of symptoms including decrease in visual sharpness, proptosis, pupillary defects, optic degeneration and visual field defects. The most common type of visual field impairment due to AVMs is homonymous hemianopia. Homonymous hemianopia typically presents unilaterally, but bilateral cases have been reported as well.|$|E
500|$|Angiolymphoid {{hyperplasia}} with eosinophilia (epithelioid hemangioma, histiocytoid hemangioma, inflammatory angiomatous nodule, inflammatory <b>arteriovenous</b> hemangioma, intravenous atypical vascular proliferation, papular angioplasia, pseudopyogenic granuloma) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} to treat brain <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations {{depends on the}} symptoms that they cause (such as seizures or headaches). The bleeding risk is predicted by previous episodes of hemorrhage, and whether on the CTA or MRA scan the AVM appears to be deep seated or have deep venous drainage. Size of the AVM {{and the presence of}} aneurysms appears to matter less. In HHT, some lesions (high-flow <b>arteriovenous</b> fistulae) tend to cause more problems, and treatment is warranted. [...] Other AVMs may regress over time without intervention. Various modalities are available, depending on the location of the AVM and its size: surgery, radiation-based treatment and embolization. Sometimes, multiple modalities are used on the same lesion.|$|E
500|$|Oculomotor nerve {{abnormalities}} (affected eye looking downward and outward and {{inability to}} lift the eyelid on the same side) or [...] (loss of movement) may indicate bleeding from the posterior communicating artery. Seizures are more common if the hemorrhage is from an aneurysm; it is otherwise difficult to predict the site and origin of the hemorrhage from the symptoms. SAH in a person known to have seizures is often diagnostic of a cerebral <b>arteriovenous</b> malformation.|$|E
500|$|SCI {{can also}} be of a nontraumatic origin. Nontraumatic lesions cause {{anywhere}} from 30 to 80% of all SCI; the percentage varies by locale, influenced by efforts to prevent trauma. Developed countries have higher percentages of SCI due to degenerative conditions and tumors than developing countries. [...] In developed countries, {{the most common cause}} of nontraumatic SCI is degenerative diseases, followed by tumors; in many developing countries the leading cause is infection such as HIV and tuberculosis. SCI may occur in intervertebral disc disease, and spinal cord vascular disease. Spontaneous bleeding can occur within or outside of the protective membranes that line the cord, and intervertebral disks can herniate. Damage can result from dysfunction of the blood vessels, as in <b>arteriovenous</b> malformation, or when a blood clot becomes lodged in a blood vessel and cuts off blood supply to the cord. When systemic blood pressure drops, blood flow to the spinal cord may be reduced, potentially causing a loss of sensation and voluntary movement in the areas supplied by the affected level of the spinal cord. Congenital conditions and tumors that compress the cord can also cause SCI, as can vertebral spondylosis and ischemia. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that can damage the spinal cord, as can infectious or inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis, herpes zoster or herpes simplex, meningitis, myelitis, and syphilis.|$|E
