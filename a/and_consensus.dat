5|$|By {{agreement}} among the Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into two separate commands, {{each with its own}} commander-in-chief. The South West Pacific Area, which included Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines came under General Douglas MacArthur as supreme commander. Most of the remainder, known as the Pacific Ocean Areas, came under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. There was no overall commander, and no authority capable of resolving competing claims for resources, setting priorities, or shifting resources from one command to the other. Such decisions had to be {{made on the basis of}} compromise, cooperation <b>and</b> <b>consensus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historians {{note the}} unusual {{contrast}} between {{his role as}} a partisan liberal Senator and {{his role as a}} conservative jurist. They attribute his shift in position as a reaction to the relationship between the New Deal senators and the conservative 1930s Court, which ruled much of the New Deal legislation unconstitutional. When Minton became a Supreme Court Justice, the Senate had become more conservative and the Court more activist, causing him to support conservative minority positions. As a Justice, Minton frequently played the role of peace-maker <b>and</b> <b>consensus</b> builder during a period when the Court was riven with feuds. He generally ruled in favor of order over freedom {{as a result of his}} broad interpretation of governmental powers. These rulings and their limited impact lead some historians to have a negative opinion of his judicial record. Other historians point out Minton's strong commitment to his judicial principles as a valuable attribute. In 1962, the Sherman Minton Bridge in southern Indiana and the Minton-Capehart Federal Building in Indianapolis were named in his honor.|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} <b>consensus</b> <b>and</b> uniform <b>consensus</b> {{problems}} in synchronous systems. In contrast to consensus, uniform consensus is not solvable with byzantine failures. This still holds for the omission failure model if {{a majority of}} processes may be faulty. For the crash failure model, both <b>consensus</b> <b>and</b> uniform <b>consensus</b> are solvable, {{no matter how many}} processes are faulty. In this failure model, we examine the number of rounds required to reach a decision in the <b>consensus</b> <b>and</b> uniform <b>consensus</b> algorithms. We show that if uniform agreement is required, one additional round is needed to decide, <b>and</b> so uniform <b>consensus</b> is also harder than consensus for crash failures. This is based on a new lower bound result for the synchronous model that we state for the uniform consensus problem. Finally, an algorithm is presented that achieves this lower bound...|$|R

We first rewrite the multi-agent systems into the corresponding reduced-order systems {{based on the}} graph theory and the reduced-order transformation. Then, the linear matrix inequality approach is used to consider the consensus of heterogeneous multi-agent systems with time-varying delays in directed networks. As a result, sufficient conditions for <b>consensus</b> <b>and</b> H_∞ <b>consensus</b> of heterogeneous multi-agent systems in terms of linear matrix inequalities are established {{in the cases of}} fixed and switching topologies.

25|$|Science {{policy is}} an area of public policy {{concerned}} with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including research funding, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring.

Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public.|$|E
25|$|For {{historian}} Akira Fujiwara, {{the thesis}} that the emperor as an organ of responsibility could not reverse cabinet decisions is a myth (shinwa) fabricated after the war. Others argue that Hirohito deliberately styled his rule {{in the manner of}} the British constitutional monarchy, and he always accepted the decisions <b>and</b> <b>consensus</b> reached by the high command. According to this position, the moral and political failure rests primarily with the Japanese High Command and the Cabinet, most of whom were later convicted at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as class-A war criminals, apart all members of the imperial family such as Prince Chichibu, Prince Yasuhiko Asaka, Prince Higashikuni, Prince Hiroyasu Fushimi and Prince Takeda.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The semi-synchronous {{model is}} an {{important}} middle ground between the synchronous and the asynchronous models of distributed computing. In this model, processes can detect (timeout) when other processes fail. However, since detection is done by timing out, it incurs a cost {{much higher than the}} typical delay of messages. The paper presents a new communication primitive, Timely Announced Broadcast (TAB), and uses it in algorithms for <b>consensus</b> <b>and</b> set <b>consensus</b> in the semi-synchronous model. Separate implementations of TAB, withstanding different types of failures, allow to derive algorithms for <b>consensus</b> <b>and</b> set <b>consensus</b> under crash <b>and</b> omission failures. The time bounds obtained by our algorithms asymptotically match, or improve, the previously known bounds...|$|R
25|$|Another smaller {{group of}} theorists have {{developed}} {{the theory of the}} Post-Bureaucratic Organization., provide a detailed discussion which attempts to describe an organization that is fundamentally not bureaucratic. Charles Heckscher has developed an ideal type, the post-bureaucratic organization, in which decisions are based on dialogue <b>and</b> <b>consensus</b> rather than authority and command, the organization is a network rather than a hierarchy, open at the boundaries (in direct contrast to culture management); there is an emphasis on meta-decision-making rules rather than decision-making rules. This sort of horizontal decision-making by consensus model is often used in housing cooperatives, other cooperatives and when running a non-profit or community organization. It is used in order to encourage participation and help to empower people who normally experience oppression in groups.|$|E
25|$|The main, and obvious, {{advantage}} of consensus logos over sequence logos is {{their ability to}} be embedded as text in any Rich Text Format supporting editor/viewer and, therefore, in scientific manuscripts. As described above, the consensus logo is a cross between sequence logos <b>and</b> <b>consensus</b> sequences. As a result, compared to a sequence logo, the consensus logo omits information (the relative contribution of each character to the conservation of that position in the motif/alignment). Hence, a sequence logo should be used preferentially whenever possible. That being said, the need to include graphic figures in order to display sequence logos has perpetuated the use of consensus sequences in scientific manuscripts, even though they fail to convey information on both conservation and frequency. Consensus logos represent therefore an improvement over consensus sequences whenever motif/alignment information has to be constrained to text.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the first}} decade of the VFA's existence, the {{structure}} of the football season did not change significantly from the informal system which had evolved over previous years. Setting of fixtures was the responsibility of club secretaries rather than the Association itself, and in a typical season, a club could play against other VFA teams, non-VFA clubs, at odds against junior teams (usually twenty players against twenty-three), and in some seasons against intercolonial teams; although as the number of senior clubs increased, the number of matches against non-VFA clubs declined. Prior to the 1888 season, there was no formally endorsed system for awarding a VFA premiership: as had been the case since the early 1870s, the premier club was determined by public and press consensus, which by the mid-1880s was conventionally but informally understood to be the senior club which suffered the fewest losses during the season. Premierships won under this then-informal method are now considered official, <b>and</b> <b>consensus</b> was typically uncontroversial.|$|E
