40|$|We derive {{the effects}} of dark matter (DM) decays and <b>annihilations</b> on {{structure}} formation. We consider moderately massive DM particles (sterile neutrinos and light DM), as {{they are expected to}} give the maximum contribution to heating and reionization. The energy injection from DM decays and <b>annihilations</b> produces both an enhancement in the abundance of coolants (H- 2 and HD) and an increase of gas temperature. We find that for all the considered DM models the critical halo mass for collapse, m(crit), is generally higher than in the unperturbed case. However, the variation of mcrit is small. In the most extreme cases, that is, considering light DM <b>annihilations</b> (decays) and haloes virializing at redshift z(vir) > 30 (z(vir) similar to 10), m(crit) increases by a factor of similar to 4 (similar to 2). In the case of <b>annihilations</b> the variations of mcrit are also sensitive to the assumed profile of the DM halo.

40|$|Abstract: We derive {{the effects}} of DM decays and <b>annihilations</b> on {{structure}} formation. We consider moderately massive DM particles (sterile neutrinos and LDM), as {{they are expected to}} give the maximum contribution to heating and reionization. The energy injection from DM decays and <b>annihilations</b> produces both an enhancement in the abundance of coolants (H_ 2 and HD) and an increase of gas temperature. We find that for all the considered DM models (sterile neutrino decays, LDM decays and <b>annihilations)</b> the critical halo mass for collapse, m_crit, is higher than in the unperturbed case. However, the variation of m_crit is small. In the most extreme case, i. e. considering LDM decays and halos virializing at redshift z_vir~ 10, m_crit increases by a factor 2. The variations of m_crit are also sensitive to the assumed concentration of the DM halo. Furthermore, we note that the fraction of gas which is retained inside the halo is substantially reduced (to ~ 40 per cent of the cosmic value), especially in the smallest halos, {{as a consequence of the}} energy injection by DM decays and <b>annihilations.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In the MSSM, LSP {{dark matter}} could {{arise from the}} decay of B-balls rather than from thermal relics, with a quite {{different}} dependence on the MSSM parameters and a natural correlation with the baryon asymmetry. We discuss the constraints imposed on the properties of B-balls and the MSSM spectrum by experimental constraints and show that B-balls cannot form from an Affleck-Dine condensate with 100 % efficiency {{in the absence of}} LSP <b>annihilations</b> after they decay. For likely formation efficiencies the LSP and slepton masses are typically constrained to be light. The effects of LSP <b>annihilations</b> after the B-balls decay are discussed; for sufficiently small decay temperatures <b>annihilations</b> will play no role, opening up the possibility of experimentally testing the scenario.

5|$|Dungeon Siege was {{the first}} title by Gas Powered Games, which was founded by in May 1998 by Chris Taylor, then known for the 1997 {{real-time}} strategy game Total <b>Annihilation.</b> Joined by several of his coworkers from Cavedog Entertainment, Taylor {{wanted to create a}} different type of game, and after trying several concepts they decided to make an action role-playing game as their first title.
