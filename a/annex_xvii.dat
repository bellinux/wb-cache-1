5000|$|Simply {{because a}} {{substance}} meets {{one or more}} of the criteria does not necessarily mean that it will be proposed as an SVHC. Many such substances are already subject to restrictions on their use within the European Union, such as those in <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII</b> of the REACH Regulation. SVHCs are substances for which the current restrictions on use (where these exist) might be insufficient. There are three priority groups for assessment: ...|$|E
50|$|The Nickel Directive was a European Union {{directive}} {{regulating the}} use of nickel in jewellery and other products that {{come into contact with}} the skin. Since 1 June 2009, it has been subsumed into the REACH Regulation, specifically item 27 of <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII</b> to that regulation. Nevertheless, the term Nickel Directive is still used to refer to the restrictions on nickel usage and the prescribed test method for quantifying nickel release from products EN 1811.|$|E
5000|$|The {{regulation}} of azo colorants by ‘The EU azo Colorants Directive 2002/61/EC’ {{has been replaced}} by the REACH regulation in 2009, when azo dyes where put on the REACH Restriction list <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII.</b> This includes that these dyes are forbidden to be used in textiles and leather, that may come in direct and prolonged contact with the skin or oral cavity. No textile of leather product are allowed to be colored with azo dyes a specific list of the items {{can be found in the}} Official Journal of the European Union. [...] Furthermore, it is prohibited to place any textile or leather articles colored with azo dyes on the market.|$|E
30|$|A well {{established}} instrument {{to regulate the}} risks of certain dangerous substances and mixtures are restrictions on manufacturing, {{placing on the market}} and use. New restrictions are introduced in <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII</b> of REACH. With the entering into force, existing restrictions already in place by the Chemicals Restrictions Directive [4] were directly integrated in <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{intention}} of the SiS concept is to regulate substances of very high concern as constituents or impurities in substances, mixtures, and in articles. In principle this is already realised in certain entries of <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII.</b> As a first case, Germany is preparing an Annex XV dossier for the PAH benzo[a]pyrene as substance in substance. Benzo[a]pyrene is the most prominent PAH known for CMR and vPvB-properties, and already regulated in mixtures for consumer uses (Annex XVIII), as an impurity in toys and as extender oil {{for the production of}} tyres or parts of tyres (<b>Annex</b> <b>XVII,</b> entry 50).|$|E
30|$|Due to its {{intrinsic}} properties, PFOA fulfills the REACH PBT-criteria. The next regulatory step will be {{the identification}} of PFOA and its ammonium salt (APFO) as SVHC according to REACH and the addition to the REACH Candidate List. As a second step, a restriction proposal will be prepared to include both substances and precursors into REACH <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII.</b>|$|E
30|$|Restrictions, as {{specified}} in <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII</b> of REACH, offer a powerful opportunity to improve {{health and environmental}} safety with respect to hazardous substances. We support an extended understanding of what {{is defined as a}} “substance of concern” in the context of restrictions. This definition should be broader than just what is currently covered by the term SVHC. Consequences of restrictions may equally apply to European producers and importers of articles from outside of Europe, which contain such substances of concern.|$|E
30|$|Surveillance {{programs}} were initiated {{to control the}} presence of substances prohibited in articles [25] and to enforce the SVHC provisions relating to articles. Some data on these activities are published in the annual reports of the responsible national authorities. It must be emphasized that the surveillance programs by national {{as well as by}} non-governmental programs focus on about a dozen SVHCs, whereas the number of SVHCs amounts to currently 173. The small number of substances monitored is due to various reasons, such as the practicability of the analytical methods, the costs of expensive articles, the handling of very bulky or heavy articles, or the fact that some SVHCs undergo chemical reactions in the production process and might then stay below the trigger value in the final article. Furthermore, the surveillance of the same substances over several years allows to detect trends. The surveillance programs conducted by the enforcement authority of the German Federal State Baden-Württemberg focused on a few article groups where SVHCs or restricted substances [1 Annex XVII] might be expected. In 2013, the analytical measurements conducted in their surveillance programs revealed that SVHCs and restricted chemicals were present in many consumer articles, in some cases at rather high concentrations. Two-thirds of the articles under scrutiny contained SVHCs above the threshold of 0.1 % and many answers by suppliers were wrong. 22 out of 84 articles contained more than 0.1 % of the respective phthalates DEHP (up to 19 %) and DIBP, whereas the producers had not indicated these SVHCs in their Art. 33 (2) answers. The authorities analyzed up to 15 different phthalates, some of which are SVHCs (di-iso-heptyl phthalate (DIHP), bis-(2 -methoxyethyl)phthalate (BMEP), N-pentyl-isopentylphthalate (PIPP), dipentyl phthalate (DPP), diisopentylphthalate (DIPP), dihexylphthalate (DHP)), some are SVHCs and listed in <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII</b> [1] (dibutyl phthalate (DBP), bis-(2 -ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), benzylbutylphthalate (BBP), di-iso-butylphthalate (DIBP)), {{and some of them are}} listed in <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII</b> and are no SVHCs up to now (dioctyl phthalate (DnOP), di-iso-nonylphthalate (DINP), di-iso-decylphthalate (DIDP)). Some phthalates that had previously been used as substitutes have meanwhile been regulated. This example of phthalates shows the problem, which surveillance organizations as well as producers have to face when provisions for a certain substance might change in the course of the years as the candidate list, <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII,</b> or other regulations are updated. Persistent organic pollutants such as short-chain chlorinated paraffins and HBCDD were also detected in various articles by the surveillance authorities of Baden-Württemberg. Cadmium was measured in articles with PVC material, jewelry, hard solder, and packaging. The biocide DMF was found in shoes and other leather articles. Lead (up to a concentration of 62 %) and cadmium (up to a concentration of 0.18 %) were measured in certain parts of electronic equipment. According to the data available in the annual reports between 2010 and 2014 [12, 26], the number of complaints remained at the same level during these years.|$|E
30|$|For Cd and its compounds, various {{restrictions}} {{already exist}} in <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII</b> of REACH (entry 23, e.g., Cd in plastics); however, {{there is no}} entry for Cd in artists’ paints covered by TARIC code (Tarif Intégré de la Communauté) 3213. The pigments used for artists’ paints are PY 35, PO 20, and PR 108 (pigment yellow, pigment orange, and pigment red) and consist of cadmium zinc sulfide CdxZn(1 −x)S (PY 35) and cadmium seleno sulfide CdS(1 −x)Se(x) (PO 20 and PR 108). According to information of CEPE, the European association of paint, printing ink and artists’ colors companies, 39 tons artists’ paints with Cd pigment are sold annually in Europe. The average content of Cd pigments in artists’ paints ranges from 12.1  % in acrylics and some 35  % in oil and water-based paints [17]. Acrylics have the highest market share in terms of quantity with 79  %, followed by oil (14  %), water paints, and gouache (7  %). The Cd quantity in artists’ paints sold in Europe was specified with 6357  kg per annum [17].|$|E
30|$|An {{option to}} {{regulate}} manufacturing, placing {{on the market}} or use of a substance on its own, in a mixture or in an article is the inclusion into <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII</b> of the REACH regulation (Restriction, Art. 67). A restriction might also include residue limits for PFOA and its precursors in articles. For PFOA and APFO as PBT-substances this seems to be appropriate to reduce the environmental PFOA concentrations effectively, because especially the residues in articles need to be controlled successfully. As also precursor compounds contribute to the environmental exposure with PFOA, these compounds need {{to be included in the}} restriction as well. To decide how an effective restriction needs to be designed more information about the residues of PFOA in articles and mixtures are necessary. Furthermore, relevant precursors need to be identified and included in the restriction. When suggesting a restriction, information about possible substitutes is essential: Some substitutes are already known but not much is known about their properties and their long-term effects. A restriction of PFOA, its salts, and its precursors under REACH is envisaged by Germany and Norway and will be initiated in 2013.|$|E
40|$|Concentrations of tin were {{measured}} in six different brands of disposable baby diapers by using radioisotope (americium) excited energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence. Top sheet and adhesive tape system {{were measured}} separately. The concentrations found in top sheet and tape system were < 1. 5 to 23. 1 mg/kg and < 1. 5 to 22. 4 mg/kg, respectively. Almost all diapers contained tin in the adhesive tape system (four of five) {{and two of}} six samples contained tin in top sheet. Tin found in diapers may be an organotin substance: tributyltin (TBT), dibutyltin (DBT), monobutyltin (MBT) and/or dioctyltin (DOT), which are widely used in industrial processes as catalysts or as PVC heat stabilizers. Organotin substances have toxic effects which include neurotoxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, immunotoxicity, and endocrine disruption. The measured concentrations were less than EU regulatory levels of 0. 1 % by weight of tin prescribed by REACH <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII</b> No 20. However, the same regulation completely bans the use of organotin substances as biocides in antifouling paints. While effects of TBT on marine organisms from antifouling paints are well known, the effects of organotin compounds in childcare products and other commercial articles receive much less attention. Children who use disposable diapers every day are particularly sensitive...|$|E
30|$|On 1 June 2007, the {{legislation}} on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) came into force. REACH shall ensure the safe manufacturing, placing {{on the market}} and use of chemicals in the European Union. Registration aims to deliver data on hazards as well as descriptions of appropriate risk management measures (RMM). Evaluation comprises dossier and substance evaluation to ensure high quality of the registrations, and to remove data gaps and identify risks which need further regulation. Where risks are not being properly controlled, REACH provides two risk management measures: authorisation and restriction. To date (status May 2013), approximately 28, 000 registration dossiers for substances were submitted and processed. The dossier evaluation is ongoing and 427 dossiers have been checked for compliance by the end of 2012 [1]. The substance evaluation has only started in 2012 and the first draft decisions on information requirements have been submitted to the registrants. Subsequent conclusions on the necessity of further risk management measures are still pending for most substances. The inclusion of substances in the candidate list for authorisation by identification as a substance of very high concern (SVHC) has made good progress. Twenty-two substances are included into Annex XIV, and for 11 substances (status December 2013), the latest application date has already expired. The first restrictions proposed by Member States have been adopted and <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII</b> has been amended [2 – 4]. Deeper insight into the aforementioned instruments of REACH and their legal background can be found elsewhere [5] and will therefore not be discussed herein.|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} {{bachelor}} paper – current legal problems in awarding public procurement contracts, being fully or partially excluded form ratione materiae of EU Public Procurement Directives – {{is related to}} actual practical concerns on effective functioning of Internal Market in field of public contracts. Above mentioned directives provide for procurement procedure only if the estimated value of public contract exceeds certain financial amount, and thus it is extremely important – {{which is also the}} aim of bachelor paper - to clarify the obligations of contracting authorities when awarding the contracts below these financial thresholds. No less important is to find out the scope of obligations of contracting authorities when awarding so-called non – priority contracts placed in <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII</b> B of Directive 2004 / 17 /EC and Annex II B of Directive 2004 / 18 /EC. Author is analyzing the connection between the European Primary and Secondary law on Public Procurement, using the rulings of ECJ, clarifications by European Commission, as well as opinio juris and opinion of legal authors. Author is examining the content of Fundamental Principles of EC Treaty and providing an in – depth analysis regarding the obligations of contracting authorities stemming from them. As the most significant problem in awarding public procurement contracts, being fully or partially excluded form ratione materiae of EU Public Procurement Directives, author recognizes the lack of legal certainty regarding the concrete obligations of contracting authorities in awarding process, and their scope Author therefore proposes solutions for mentioned problem, that can be also used as an output for discussion on some possible changes in EU Public Procurement Law...|$|E
30|$|Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) {{belong to}} the {{chemical}} group of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) [3]. PFAS are used in numerous industrial applications (e.g. electroplating, fluoropolymer production, photography), fire extinguishing agents and as processing aids in impregnation agents for {{a large number of}} consumer products (e.g. textile, carpet and leather protectors and food contact papers) since the 1950 s [4 – 6]. Because of their various applications, large amounts of PFAS have been released into the environment, leading to their presence and detection in wildlife and humans [7 – 12]. The most widely studied PFAAs are perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) with the most frequently detected eight-carbon homologues perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). These substances have received most attention because of their persistence [3, 13], toxic effects to mammals [14] and their strong tendency for bioaccumulation [15] and biomagnification in food chain [16, 17]. The chemical and biological persistence of PFAAs is generally believed to be a result of the carbon–fluorine bond, {{which is one of the}} strongest covalent bonds in nature [18]. Concerns about the potential of toxicity, environmental persistence and bioaccumulation have led to restricting use and inclusion of PFOS and its related substances in the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutions (POPs) in 2009 [19]. Also for PFOA, a stewardship agreement between the US environmental protection agency (US EPA) and the leading global manufacturers intends to eliminate the environmental emission until 2015 [20]. In the European union, the phase-out of long-chain PFCAs (C 9, C 11 –C 14), PFOA and its ammonium salt (APFO) is controlled using the European chemical regulation (REACH EC No. 1907 / 2006). These substances have been identified as substances of very high concern (SVHC) and are included into the candidate list as substances proposed for authorization. Moreover, PFOA is discussed for inclusion into the restriction proceedings regulated in REACH <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII</b> (Restriction, Art. 67) [21, 22].|$|E
