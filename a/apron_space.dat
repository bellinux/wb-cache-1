50|$|Most of {{the cars}} {{carrying}} the dirt spoils were wooden flat cars lined with steel floors that used a crude but effective unloading device, the Lidgerwood system. The railroad cars had only one side, and steel <b>aprons</b> bridged the <b>spaces</b> between them. The rock and dirt were first blasted loose by explosives. Two sets of tracks were then built or moved up to where the loosened material lay. The steam shovels, moving on one set of tracks, picked up the loosened dirt and piled it on the flat cars traveling on a parallel set of tracks. The dirt was piled high up against the one closed side of the car. The train moved forward until all cars were filled. A typical train had 20 dirt cars arranged as essentially one long car.|$|R
50|$|The {{airside area}} will be {{accessible}} only to ticketed and screened passengers. Securitas Germany will staff the 35 screening stations. BER is equipped with 25 jet bridges, with another 85 aircraft stands on the apron. The boarding and arrival areas are divided into three piers with the main pier at 715 m long and {{the north and south}} piers at 350 m each. The main pier contains 16 jet-bridges; all but one have two levels, thus separating arriving and departing passengers. Level 1 is intended for Schengen passengers (gates A01-A20, B01-B20), while Level 2 (gates C01-C19, D01-D17) is for non-Schengen passengers. Eight of the gates can accommodate wide-body aircraft and one gate has been designed to accommodate the Airbus A380, the largest commercial airliner currently in use. The <b>apron</b> has sufficient <b>space</b> to allow installation of a dual jetway allowing a quick boarding and disembarking process. A mezzanine (Level Z) at gates A21-22 and B21 allows for additional pre-boarding security checks for high-risk flights to the United States and Israel. Air Berlin, Lufthansa and Air France/KLM will operate airport lounges in the main pier, which will also be open for passengers of the respective alliance partners.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, the BRIDEX International Conference Centre, Jerudong was {{purpose built}} for BRIDEX events.

50|$|A new {{terminal}} building opened in July 2011, giving the airport an ultimate capacity of 3 million passengers per year. The {{new terminal}} has 25 check-in desks, 4 baggage carousels, and 9 boarding gates. The new terminal is farther back {{than the old}} terminal, meaning that <b>apron</b> <b>space</b> is maximised. There are still no {{plans to build a}} taxiway parallel to the runway, so aircraft still have to backtaxi on the runway, limiting capacity to 10 operations per hour. The airport also has a new control tower.|$|E
50|$|Avinor is {{considering}} steps {{to expand the}} airport. It still has the inaugural terminal from 1971, which {{is in need of}} expansion. Additional <b>apron</b> <b>space</b> is also needed, as is car parking. Further extension of the runway is also being considered, either to 1700 or 2000 m. Either way the extension would be westwards. The sounds of Ausa and Furesundet would have to be filled and the two islands as well as Furøya leveled. Avinor has estimated the costs at about 200 million kroner.|$|E
5000|$|Colonel Robert E. Selway made white {{officers}} {{the head}} {{of each of the}} four divisions of the 477th though there were many black aviators that were much more qualified. In addition, Selway, without any advance notice to his men, ordered that people of the 477th to board trains to move to an unknown location. Selway was concerned about race tensions in Detroit that had never affected his unit and despite the pressures of preparing a unit that he would lead into combat, moved the unit to Godman Army Air Field near Fort Knox, Kentucky. This base was completely inadequate for the 477th. Selfridge had four times more hangar space the Godman, seven times the area, five times the aviation gasoline capacity, more runways, and better flying weather. More to the point, Godman could not house the entire group at one time because the field had inadequate <b>apron</b> and hangar <b>space.</b> The move was bad and it was done for racial reasons. The move seriously delayed the 477th training program and damaged morale." [...] The 477th was at the undersized Godman Field from May 5, 1944 to March 1, 1945, but this was soon followed by an act of mutiny.|$|R
50|$|The 1970s {{increment}} {{of traffic}} {{led to a}} further development plan, including the construction in 1973 of a new control tower, a new passenger terminal in 1974, in 1975 an independent power plant and in 1976 the <b>apron</b> <b>space</b> and parking places were both increased and taxiways widened. A few years after the runway was lengthened so DC-9 series aircraft {{were able to use}} the airport. As a result, in November 1981 the airport had its first international flight to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the closure}} of the casino, the resort was taken over by the Asia Pacific Space Centre, which {{developed}} plans for a satellite launch facility on Christmas Island. The company, with solid financial participation from the Australian Government, had planned to start satellite launches in 2004. [...] Technical staff was to include 350-400 Russian rocket scientists and engineers, and componentry was to be flown in on Antonov An-124 and Boeing 747 freighters. To achieve this, the airport would need major extensions, and the Government allocated around A$55m to the task. This included a 600 m runway extension, plus additional taxiways, <b>apron</b> <b>space,</b> and other infrastructure.|$|E
50|$|The City of Harlingen {{operates}} a busy industrial airpark where bombers used to land. At Valley International Airport the Confederate Air Force (now Commemorative Air Force) occupied hangar and <b>apron</b> <b>space</b> until 1991. The first hospital in Harlingen opened in 1923 {{and consisted of}} {{little more than two}} barracks as wings. The Valley Baptist Hospital was built nearby a few years later, and eventually the older hospital closed. The Valley Baptist Hospital has grown into the Valley Baptist Medical Center. The city's outstanding network of health care specialists and facilities parallels the growth of the still-expanding center. Also serving regional health needs are the South Texas State Chest Hospital, the State Hospital for Children, and the Rio Grande State Mental Health and Mental Retardation Center.|$|E
50|$|The Tokyo Monorail opened between Haneda {{and central}} Tokyo in 1964, {{in time for}} the Tokyo Olympics. During 1964 Japan lifted travel {{restrictions}} on its citizens, causing passenger traffic at the airport to swell. The introduction of jet aircraft in the 1960s followed by the Boeing 747 in 1970 also required various facility improvements at Haneda. Around 1961, the government began considering further expansion of Haneda with a third runway and additional <b>apron</b> <b>space,</b> but forecast that the expansion would only meet capacity requirements for about ten years following completion. In 1966, the government decided to build a new airport for international flights. In 1978, Narita Airport opened, taking over almost all international service in the Greater Tokyo Area, and Haneda became a domestic airport.|$|E
5000|$|Oulu Airport ( [...] ; Oulun lentoasema, Uleåborgs flygplats) {{is located}} in Oulu, Finland, [...] {{south-west}} of the city centre. The airport is the second busiest in Finland after Helsinki-Vantaa Airport, {{as measured by the}} number of passengers (ca. 1 million in 2016). There are around twenty daily flights to Helsinki. Oulu Airport is also extensively used by the Finnish Air Force for training purposes. Recently the old terminal was demolished for more <b>apron</b> <b>space.</b> A major extension of the main terminal was completed in September 2011. Four new jetbridge gates (gates 13-16) were constructed and the main terminal was expanded by 4300 m2, raising the capacity of the airport to 1.5 million passengers per year. The managing body of the airport is Finavia. Oulu Airport has offered free wireless network access for passengers since May 2007.|$|E
50|$|Phase 1: Airport {{officials}} said as per {{the first phase}} of the expansion plan, the authorities are going to link the old terminal of the airport with the new one.It will connect the corridor of the old terminal with the new one with the help of three aerobridges and walkalators and would also have walk-in gates on the ground floor. This building will be used for boarding and de-boarding of passengers. Passengers getting down in the old terminal would take the connecting bridge to take the new terminal and then leave the airport. This would help reduce peak-hour congestion when several flights do not get enough <b>apron</b> <b>space.</b> This plan is ready and hopefully by the end of this financial year(17-18), this process will be completed. This would immediately increase the passenger capacity by a few million and would solve the space crunch for the time being.|$|E
50|$|Augusto Severo Airport {{has ceased}} to be Greater Natal International Airport since summer 2014. The new airport, {{situated}} outside the city, is in São Gonçalo do Amarante.Located virtually at sea level (169 ft), with favorable weather and geographic conditions, Augusto Severo International Airport in Parnamirim is 18 kilometers from Natal (RN). It {{takes its name from}} Augusto Severo de Albuquerque Maranhão, a native son of that state who died in an accident in France in 1902. The airport has a total area of 11.3 thousand square meters and capacity for 1.2 million passengers a year. The installations and passenger terminals are air conditioned with equipment that can put out 630 tons of cooled air. With an area of 5.5 million square meters, the airport complex operates with 16,482 square meters of passenger and cargo terminals and administrative and maintenance installations. There are 6,224 meters of runways and 61.5 square meters of <b>apron</b> <b>space,</b> providing connections from the greater Natal region to the main centers of the world. The airport is {{the only one in the}} Northeast Region to receive charter flights from Scandinavia.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, {{the airport}} {{underwent}} a radical make-over {{that resulted in}} a re-carpeted runway as well as apron. A lounge for domestic arrival and departures was constructed in 1980. In 1983, a briefing area was constructed to allow family members of passengers seeing off their relatives, as well as an Air Traffic Control building. The main road to the airport was re-developed and constructed to meet international standards by 1984. The Pakistan State Oil decided to provide aviation fuel to flights handled at the airport and built their own facility in 1994. The CAA of Pakistan decided to re-develop the airport in 2000, which housed the CAA administration office as well as a new ATC building. In 2003, a new arrivals lounge was constructed as well as a CIP premium lounge. A DVLS room was constructed in 2005. Custom and immigration facilities were upgraded in the same year. In 2008 a new office building for airlines and airport operational staff were inaugurated. The local government and the CAA have reported to be upgrading the airport to meet international standards in 2009 with new lounges, control tower and more <b>apron</b> <b>space</b> to handle more flights.|$|E
