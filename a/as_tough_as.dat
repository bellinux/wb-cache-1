For example, Dremel disks {{are designed to be}} <b>as</b> <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> possible without breaking unless the job requires it to be spent. Furthermore, they are designed to break at a point before the shrapnel velocity could seriously injure someone (other than the eyes, though safety glasses should be worn at all times anyway).|$|E
25|$|English Shepherds {{are often}} larger than Border Collie, but {{the quickest way}} to tell the two apart is to put them on stock. Border Collies tend to herd with a {{distinctive}} strong eye contact and a crouching stance, while English Shepherds have an upright, loose-eyed herding style. English Shepherds can work all types of stock—from the meanest bull to baby chickens. Compared to others, they are prized above specialty herding breeds for being as gentle as possible or <b>as</b> <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> necessary with the stock.|$|E

He also cited {{an example of a}} captive female dingo removing a bundle of meat from its wrapping paper and leaving the paper intact.

25|$|Davis {{was signed}} by Kerry Packer for World Series Cricket in 1977. As one of the {{brightest}} talents in Australia his signature was considered vital for the marketing and success of the brand. In the first year of WSC (1977/78) Davis played 3 Supertests scoring a best of 84 against the World XI. He would play 2 more Supertests in the 1978/79 season scoring just 48 runs (ave. 12). Davis found breaking into the WSC Australian XI just <b>as</b> <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> the official side his path being blocked by McCosker and Bruce Laird. The fact that Davis averaged roughly half as many runs in Supertests as he did in official tests highlights the high level of competition in WSC. It was during the second Supertest that Australian batsman David Hookes suffered a broken jaw from an Andy Roberts bouncer. Packer was said to encourage his bowlers to be aggressive. Traditional cricket followers became shocked by the posteuring and bad-language broadcast via pitch microphones. The highly charged atmosphere and Packer's preference for fast bowling led to many of the WSC stars, including Davis, to wear protective helmets. A piece of cricket equipment Davis would later help develop after retirement.|$|E

500|$|According to Time {{television}} critic James Poniewozik, {{by the end}} of {{the first}} episode, it becomes clear that Underwood both literally and figuratively uses meat as his metaphor of choice. He may begin a day with a celebratory rack of ribs, because [...] "I'm feelin' hungry today!", and he depicts his life with meat metaphors. For example, he describes the White House Chief of Staff with grudging admiration: [...] "She’s <b>as</b> <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> a two-dollar steak" [...] and plans to destroy an enemy the way [...] "you devour a whale. One bite at a time". He also endures a tedious weekly meeting with House leaders, as he tells the audience, by [...] " [...] their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet." ...|$|E

Richardson wrote how [...] "Fleming's method is worth noting, and recommending: he does not start indulging in his wilder fantasies until he has laid down a foundation of factual description." [...] Elements of a review by Raymond Chandler for The Sunday Times were used as advertising for the novel; Chandler wrote that it was [...] "about the nicest piece of book-making {{in this type of}} literature which I have seen for a long time... Mr. Fleming writes a journalistic style, neat, clean, spare and never pretentious".|$|E

Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel, also starring Carey Mulligan and Tobey Maguire; the film was released on May 10, 2013. It received mixed reviews from critics, however DiCaprio's portrayal as Jay Gatsby was praised. Critic Rafer Guzman of Newsday praised DiCaprio by stating, [...] "As for Leonardo DiCaprio, {{he is now the}} Gatsby to beat. Despite a borderline comedic entrance – haloed by fireworks and accompanied by Gershwin's [...] "Rhapsody in Blue"—DiCaprio nails this maddeningly enigmatic character. He's <b>as</b> <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> Alan Ladd in '49, as suave as Redford in '74, but also vulnerable, touching, funny, a faker, a human. You hear it all in Gatsby's favorite phrase, [...] "old sport," [...] a verbal tic that stumped other actors. It's a tremendous, hard-won performance." [...] Matt Zoller Seitz of Roger Ebert.com described his performance as Gatsby as [...] "The movie's greatest and simplest special effect," [...] and states [...] "This is an iconic performance — maybe his career best." [...] The film grossed $348 million worldwide and became Luhrmann's highest-grossing film.|$|E
500|$|Critics praised Super Meat Boys {{platforming}} elements, {{and often}} {{commented on the}} game's difficulty. X-Play reviewer Alexandra Hall said the game had [...] "riveting platforming action", and added that [...] "Super Meat Boys designers are masters of their craft." [...] Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar felt the platforming was [...] "perfect". He wrote that [...] "while it's always tough and demanding, it never feels cheap, or like the game is cheating you." [...] A reviewer from GameTrailers stated that [...] "the difficulty rides the perfect line between driving you utterly bonkers when you fail and making {{you feel like a}} platform pro when you succeed". Joystiq's Richard Mitchell echoed other reviewers' comments: [...] "Super Meat Boy is tough, <b>as</b> <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> the toughest nails in the toughest universe." [...] Gilbert cited the level of difficulty, which he believed made the game inaccessible to some players, as his reason for not awarding the game a perfect score. Tom McShea of GameSpot praised the game's [...] "precise control", [...] "excellent level design", and [...] "smooth difficulty curve". Reviewer Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer warned that Super Meat Boy is [...] "a hard game. It should make you want to throw the pad across the room".|$|E
500|$|Casting {{continued}} into August 2013, with {{the announcement that}} James Spader would play Ultron. In November, Marvel confirmed that Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson would play the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, respectively. Taylor-Johnson had been in negotiations since as early as June, while Olsen's potential involvement was first reported in August. By {{the end of the}} year, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and Cobie Smulders were confirmed to be returning to their roles from the first film, and Don Cheadle, who portrayed James Rhodes in the Iron Man films, had committed to a part in the film. In the early months of 2014, Thomas Kretschmann was cast as Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, Claudia Kim was cast in an unspecified role, and Paul Bettany, who voiced J.A.R.V.I.S. in previous MCU films, was cast as the Vision. Whedon said [...] "juggling" [...] all the characters in the film was [...] "a nightmare" [...] explaining, [...] "They're very disparate characters. The joy of the Avengers is they really don't belong in the same room. It's not like the X-Men, who are all tortured by the same thing and have similar costumes. These guys are just all over the place. And so it's tough. Honestly, this is <b>as</b> <b>tough</b> <b>as</b> anything I've ever done." ...|$|E
