Plain godamba roti is eaten with curry or {{it can also be}} wrapped around a savory filling. To prepare one needs to [...] mix together the flour, salt and the tablespoon of oil and rub together. [...] Then lukewarm water is added, mixed and kneaded for approximately 10 minutes. The next step is making balls and spreading a layer of oil on the outer layer of the flour ball. [...] On <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>board</b> or flat surface, the balls are flattened with the fingers or palms. The shape may be square, round or oval. After flattening, place the spread-out roti on a hot square pan. The roti is left to cook on the pan until it becomes golden brown. Then it is flipped to the other side. Once both sides are golden brown, the godamba roti is ready to be consumed.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>cutting</b> out <b>boarding</b> is <b>an</b> {{attack by}} small boats, preferably {{at night and}} against an unsuspecting, and anchored, target. It became popular in the later 18th century, and was {{extensively}} used during the Napoleonic Wars.

An example is the successful cutting out of the Hermione which took place at Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, on 25 October 1799.|$|R
