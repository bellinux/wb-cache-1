40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the concept of intergenerational {{learning}} as a way for organizations to deal with an <b>ageing</b> <b>worker</b> population in a positive and constructive way. Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs a thematic synthesis of qualitative literature and considers all types of sources including quantitative scientific reports, reports on case studies, practitioner reports, social program evaluations and White Papers. Findings – The paper points out that intergenerational learning is an effective way to organize learning at the workplace as it appeals to older worker motivations and learning styles, benefiting both worker and organization. Research limitations/implications – The paper leads to several testable hypotheses concerning intergenerational learning. There also needs to be more work on how cognitive differences might affect interactive processes in intergenerational learning groups. Practical implications – This paper can give managers ideas on organizing intergenerational learning as a strategy for dealing with an <b>ageing</b> <b>worker</b> population. Originality/value – This paper opens up new possibilities for both researchers and practitioners of workplace learning by using age and other concepts of diversity as a building block for organizing learning environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to lay the groundwork for a {{large-scale}} prescriptive research project on organizing intergenerational communities of practice as a way to help organizations deal with some of the problems an <b>ageing</b> <b>worker</b> population brings with it. After a definition of the problem, a review of four seminal works on communities of practice was done to see if organizing intergenerational communities of practice might in fact be a viable solution to the problems of an ageing organizational population. Results are encouraging and lead to the conclusion that management might start to consider organizing these communities as a way to shed new light on older workers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{lays the}} groundwork for a {{research}} program on the topic of how intergenerational learning can contribute to the effectiveness of organizations by capitalizing on the capacities of the <b>ageing</b> <b>worker.</b> According to innumerable studies published by policy research centers in the EU and other developed countries, the pool of available workers is diminishing at an alarming rate due to retirement and an ageing population (Bartels, 2010; Commision, 2009; Stam, 2009). Although there is quite some work on the problem of an ageing population, reports in scientific journals and practitioner, or grey, literature fail to present much empirical work on the specific topic of how organizations can capitalize on the knowledge and innovative capacities of an older worker (INNO-Grips, 2008). Mostly one finds reports and studies that further define the problem and speculate about future consequences. This latter aspect is especially evident in the grey literature...|$|E
40|$|ICTs with <b>ageing</b> <b>workers</b> In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{an approach to}} base the design of ICTs profoundly on {{the actual practice of}} <b>ageing</b> <b>workers.</b> The core challenge of the presented case study is to appropriately facilitate co-design activities with <b>ageing</b> <b>workers,</b> who have had no previous experience with the development of ICTs. The aim of the presented project was to enable the <b>ageing</b> <b>workers</b> to express their needs in a manner that would result in ideas highly relevant to them in their work. It was assumed that the workers, who engage in physical work such as cleaning and technical maintenance, would find it difficult to imagine novel ICTs and their possibilities. However, it was revealed that the <b>ageing</b> <b>workers</b> could understand new technical opportunities for them, and also envision new technologies that support their well-being and efficiency at work. The approach, which is based on the use of Sander's Make Tools, also helped to reveal the variegated attitudes that <b>ageing</b> <b>workers</b> have towards modern technologies...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore {{organizational}} factors which are responsible for sickness absence and intent to leave from juniors and to compare these results with those on old <b>age</b> <b>workers.</b> Design/methodology/approach The approach taken is a quantitative analysis on a total of 5239 young <b>age</b> <b>workers</b> with a multinomial logit model. Findings Compared to old <b>age</b> <b>workers,</b> some organizational factors (monotony, autonomy, skill variety, time pressure, working hours, tension with the public and thermal pollutions) have a strong impact on absenteeism and intent to leave of young <b>age</b> <b>workers.</b> Furthermore, the links between some of this organizational factors and absenteeism-intent to leave is mediated by job satisfaction and health at work.

Information and communications technology (ICT) in its many forms can be utilized to support IGL. This paper investigates the requirements for a game that would help raise stakeholder awareness for IGL, and allow individuals to practice skills related to it. By interviewing members of the European Union (EU) -funded SILVER-project we aim to find out suitable contexts, interventions and mechanisms that allow us to design such a game. Based on the interviews we found out that the game should be easily contextualized so that it works in—or is easily adapted to—different countries and cultures. For example sports or nature could be such contexts. As for mechanisms and interventions we found out that there are many possibilities. We conclude that such a logical combination of mechanisms and interventions that support the selected context must be chosen...|$|E
40|$|More recently, {{lifespan}} development psychology {{models of}} adaptive development {{have been applied}} to the workforce to investigate <b>ageing</b> <b>worker</b> and lifespan issues. The current study uses the Learning and Development Survey (LDS) to investigate employee selection and engagement of learning and development goals and opportunities and constraints for learning at work in relation to demographics and career goals. It was found that mature age was associated with perceptions of preferential treatment of younger workers with respect to learning and development. Age was also correlated with several career goals. Findings suggest that younger workers’ learning and development options are better catered for in the workplace. Mature aged workers may compensate for unequal learning opportunities at work by studying for an educational qualification or seeking alternate job opportunities. The desire for a higher level job within the organization or educational qualification was linked to engagement in learning and development goals at work. It is suggested that an understanding of employee perceptions in the workplace in relation to goals and activities may be important in designing strategies to retain workers...|$|E
40|$|Ageing {{workers can}} be found in almost all occupations. Assessment of fitness to work in these workers is important, as it aims to match their {{functional}} capacity (which is reduced compared to younger workers), to the demands of their work (which may remain the same as that for younger workers). This outcome of assessment is influenced by the interaction between functional capacity, state of health, the nature of work, and possibilities for work accommodation. The assessment of functional capacity should include physical, mental and social capacity, as well as assessment of any disability. In addition to clinical or laboratory measurements, several authors have suggested the use of a 'work ability index ' for specific occupations as a practical means of selecting the appropriate worker for the job. This index can also be used for monitoring functional capacity. In addition, as for any fitness to work assessment, a good {{understanding of the nature of}} the work and the work environment is required, and possibilities for work accommodations considered. While changes in the work environment and working conditions can be made to suit the functional capacity of the <b>ageing</b> <b>worker,</b> the maintenance of functional capacity is another important issue.

Despite increasing interest {{in understanding the}} factors involved in the decision of mature <b>aged</b> <b>workers</b> to participate or withdraw from the labour market, {{a number of key}} questions remain unanswered. The goals of this study revolve around three research issues. These are the identification of: methods to increase participation of mature <b>aged</b> <b>workers</b> in the labour market; barriers to participation and the costs and benefits (both financial and non financial) of engaging mature <b>age</b> <b>workers</b> from both an employer and employee perspective. An interdisciplinary approach was taken in this research with the complex issues surrounding the participation of mature <b>age</b> <b>workers</b> in the labour market examined using economic and psychological theory. Questionnaire based data was collected via a mail out to 3, 000 members of the National Seniors. The findings indicate that factors influencing the withdrawal / participation decision exist at three levels. First structural economic and public policy factors impact on the welfare of individuals in the later stages of their working life. Second, organisational attitudes and policies impinge on the recruitment and retention of mature workers and third, individual factors such as motivation, perceived stereotypes and economic status influence the decision to withdraw from work at a personal level. Based on the results of these surveys recommendations are made to improve the maintenance of labourforce engagement of mature <b>age</b> <b>workers</b> in Australia...|$|R

This innovative book specifically focuses on how organizations can ensure their <b>aging</b> <b>workers</b> remain motivated, productive and healthy. In 15 chapters, several experts on this topic describe how organizations through effective human resource management can ensure that workers are able to continue working at higher age. In addition, this book discusses the role older workers themselves play in continuing work at higher age. To do this, the authors integrate research from different areas, such as literature on leadership, psychological contracts and diversity with literature on the aging workforce. Through this integration this book provides innovative ways for organizations and workers to maintain productivity, motivation and health. <b>Aging</b> <b>Workers</b> and the Employee-Employer Relationship summarizes the latest research on how employment relationships change with age {{and its implications for}} supporting the well-being, motivation and productivity of older workers.

The shortcoming of the health of <b>aging</b> <b>workers</b> is partially attributed to improper lifestyle, including tobacco smoking, physical inactivity, improper nutrition and ergonomics. Thereby our basic assumption is that, most of <b>aging</b> <b>workers</b> lack enough awareness of health effects of lifestyle. In order to assess the awareness of <b>aging</b> <b>workers</b> we conducted a descriptive study in year 2001. Although every <b>aging</b> <b>worker</b> might be at risk of developing improper lifestyle practice born disorders, but since the housekeeping staff {{is believed to be the}} least privileged ones, were chosen to participate in the study. Seventy subjects all male workers, over 45 years old, less than 12 years of formal education and performing housekeeping duties were selected and their awareness was assessed using a sixteen-item questionnaire. Findings of the study indicated that, the respondents held a good awareness of health effects of tobacco smoking (85 %), physical inactivity (77 %), improper nutrition (65 %) and improper ergonomics; excessive physical demands, stressful and dangerous work environment and poor organization of work (97 %). Sixty-four percent of the subjects reported having heard about the programs which aim to improve the awareness of the workers and (66 %) reported never attended such programs. Findings of this study also confirmed that formal programs offered by the employers did not have enough incentives to attract the majority of the subjects and the source of their awareness was other than these programs. Thereby findings suggest that employers should continuously upgrade subject`s awareness and practice of healthy lifestyle by offering suitable and attractive programs...|$|R
40|$|In Germany, as in {{many other}} European countries, there will be a shift in the {{workforce}} age structure in the next decades. The number of older workers will increase, and the number of younger and middle <b>aged</b> <b>workers</b> will decline. This paper provides evidence how the shift in the relative labor supply affects labor productivity, taking into account that differently <b>aged</b> <b>workers</b> are suggested to be imperfect substitutes. Using a cross sectional linked employer-employee data set from 2012, translog cost functions are estimated. To control for the skill level of the workers a nested production structure is applied. This allows to analyze age complementarities within groups of workers that have a comparable skill level. Based on the estimated parameters, pairwise elasticities of complementarity and factor price elasticities are computed. The results indicate that workers that belong to different age groups are complementary factors. But the degree of complementarity differs, depending on the age and the skill level of the workers. The complementarities especially arise between younger and middle <b>aged</b> <b>workers.</b> The highest degree of complementarity is observed between younger and middle aged high skilled labor. Simulating how the expected shift in the age structure affects labor productivity indicates that the productivity of younger and middle <b>aged</b> <b>workers</b> will increase. In contrast, the productivity of older workers will significantly decline caused by their increasing share in the workforce. July 11, 2017 (slightly revised version...|$|R

40|$|This article investigates work related {{learning}} and development amongst mature <b>aged</b> <b>workers</b> from a lifespan developmental psychology perspective. The current study follows on from research regarding {{the construction and}} revision of the Learning and Development Survey (LDS; Tones & Pillay, 2008). Designed to measure adaptive development for work related learning, the revised LDS (R-LDS) encompasses goal selection, engagement and disengagement from individual and organisational perspectives. Previous survey findings from a mixed age sample of local government workers suggest that mature <b>aged</b> <b>workers</b> <b>aged</b> over 45 years {{are less likely to}} report engagement in {{learning and}} development goals than younger workers, which is partly due to insufficient opportunities at work. In the current paper, exploratory factor analysis was used to investigate responses to the R-LDS amongst two groups of mature <b>aged</b> <b>workers</b> from a local government (LG) and private healthcare (PH) organisation to determine the stability of the R-LDS. Organisational constraints to development accounted for almost a quarter of the variance in R-LDS scores for both samples, while remaining factors emerged in different orders for each data set. Organisational opportunities for development explained about 17 % of the variance in R-LDS scores in the LG sample, while the individual goal disengagement factor contributed a comparable proportion of variance to R-LDS scores for the PH sample. Findings from the current study indicate that opportunities for learning and development at work may be age structured and biased towards younger workers.

Methods: A systematic review was performed by searching five electronic databases for relevant studies published between January 1992 and February 2014. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental intervention studies were included. The study population included <b>workers</b> <b>aged</b> ≥ 40 years, and the measured outcomes were positive indicators of labour force participation, i. e.
