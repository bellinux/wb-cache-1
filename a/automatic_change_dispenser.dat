In the event of a power failure from the mains supply, this automatic changeover is designed and constructed to switch on a standby generator and transfer the installation load to it (the generator) and vice versa when power is restored.

40|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>change</b> pattern mapping {{in urban}} and sub-urban area is {{important}} but challenging {{due to the}} diversity of urban land use pattern. With multi-sensor imagery, {{it is possible to}} generate multidimensional unique information of Earth surface features that allow developing a relationship between a response of each feature to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical sensors to track the change automatically. Thus, a SAR and optical data integration framework for change detection and a relationship for <b>automatic</b> <b>change</b> pattern detection were developed. It was carried out in three steps: (i) Computation of indicators from SAR and optical images, namely: normalized difference ratio (NDR) from multi-temporal SAR images and the normalized difference vegetation index difference (∆NDVI) from multi-temporal optical images, (ii) computing the change magnitude image from NDR and ∆NDVI and delineating the change area and (iii) the development of an empirical relationship, for <b>automatic</b> <b>change</b> pattern detection. The experiment was carried out in an outskirts part of Ho Chi Minh City, {{one of the fastest growing}} cities in the world. The empirical relationship between the response of surface feature to optical and SAR imagery has successfully delineated six changed classes in a very complex urban sprawl area that was otherwise impossible with multi-spectral imagery. The improvement of the change detection results by making use of the unique information on both sensors, optical and SAR, is also noticeable with a visual inspection and the kappa index was increased by 0. 13 (0. 75 to 0. 88) in comparison to only optical images. 1...|$|R

40|$|Change {{detection}} is {{an important}} application of remote sensing in environmental monitoring. A modeling-based threshold approach using the connectivity information of individual pixels (regions) was introduced and compared with the method using standard deviation as the region-based change detection give often better results. This approach was used in combination with four widely used image differencing methods to derive change and no change information over a semi-natural vegetated area in Mediterranean southern France. After comparing the results visually {{with the aid of}} a vegetation map and aerial photos, a suitable <b>automatic</b> <b>change</b> detection method was developed: the tasseled cap transformation plus change vector differencing followed by this modeling-based thresholding approach.
