The label started to shelve the album {{until a few}} key radio stations started playing the song [...] "Lucky Denver Mint." [...] After Capitol Records decided not to release their next major-label album, the band left the label. At that time, Jimmy Eat World distributed their albums independently while on tour in Europe. Drummer Zach Lind recalled that the label [...] "really didn’t believe in us. But in a way, {{that was sort of}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>because</b> it let us take control of what we needed to do. We learned we had to do it ourselves, because no one else would do it for us." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{announcement}} of Sega's third-party transition {{was met with}} widespread enthusiasm. According to IGN's Travis Fahs, [...] "Sega was a creatively fertile company with a rapidly expanding stable of properties to draw from. It seemed like {{they were in a}} perfect position {{to start a new life}} as a developer/publisher." [...] Former Working Designs president Victor Ireland wrote that [...] "It's actually <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing...</b> <b>because</b> now Sega will survive, doing what they do best: software." [...] The staff of Newsweek remarked [...] "From Sonic to Shenmue, Sega's programmers have produced some of the most engaging experiences in the history of interactive media... Unshackled by a struggling console platform, this platoon of world-class software developers can do what they do best for any machine on the market". Rosen predicted [...] "they have the potential to catch Electronic Arts". Game Informer, commenting on Sega's tendency to produce under-appreciated cult classics, stated: [...] "Let us rejoice in the fact that Sega is making games equally among the current console crop, so that history will not repeat itself." ...|$|E
500|$|On 15 March 2008, the band's {{tour bus}} {{burst into flames}} outside their hotel in Medford, Massachusetts. Noonan and Geraghty were on board the vehicle {{alongside}} their manager and a friend. Brian Crosby, Dominic Phillips, and Tim O'Donovan were inside the hotel. Fire fighters were called to the scene shortly after 3:30am and spent ninety minutes fanning the blaze, which started in the bus ventilation/air-conditioning unit and caused an estimated $50,000 (€32,000) worth of damage. Talking to local newspaper the Boston Herald, the band's manager, Foye Johnson said: [...] "The guys were basically around the bus, which was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>because</b> {{we were able to}} get all the equipment and instruments out." [...] After a few hours of sleep, off they went in a replacement vehicle to New York City where the band played a sell-out show in the Bowery Ballroom and appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, Other North American television appearances during the early part of 2008 included MTV Canada, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and Late Night with Conan O'Brien. They would return to perform on the Late Show with David Letterman one year later.|$|E

500|$|Other {{themes were}} more general. [...] "Lady Killer" [...] {{has been cited}} as having a {{considerable}} thrash metal influence, and its topic of revenge against a serial killer is comparable to songs such as Iron Maiden's [...] "Murders in the Rue Morgue" [...] and Judas Priest's [...] "The Ripper". The song emerged when the band attempted to [...] "write a theme song for Jack the Ripper," [...] according to Heppner, and its distinctive intro was created by generating feedback on a 1976 Gibson SG run through a 1970s MXR rack flanger. [...] "The Gem" [...] portrays the apocalypse as being <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>because</b> it wipes humanity off the planet; whoever sets it in motion (Heppner explained as by [...] "open Pandora's Box") is hailed as a hero for having done the right thing. [...] "Communicating Via-Eyes" [...] is [...] "the werewolf song", as Heppner put it; he wrote much of that song while on tour with Megadeth in the UK. He later stated a song loosely inspired by An American Werewolf in London was written for the album, {{but it is not}} clear whether he was referring to a song already on the album or an outtake from it.|$|E
500|$|In particular, the console's {{status as}} an add-on and poor timing after the {{announcement}} of the Saturn has been identified by reviewers as being responsible factors for fracturing the audience for Sega's video game consoles in terms of both developers and consumers. [...] Allgame notes that [...] "very add-on whittled away at the number of potential buyers and discouraged third-party companies from making the games necessary to boost sales." [...] GamePro criticized the concept of the add-on, noting the expenses involved in purchasing the system. [...] According to reviewer Blake Snow, [...] "Just how many 16-bit attachments did one need? All in all, if {{you were one of the}} unlucky souls who completely bought into Sega's add-on frenzy, you would have spent a whopping $650 for something that weighed about as much as a small dog." [...] Writing for GamesRadar, Reparaz noted that [...] "developers—not wanting to waste time on a technological dead-end—abandoned the 32X in droves. Gamers quickly followed suit, turning what was once a promising idea into an embarrassing footnote in console history, as well as an object lesson in why console makers shouldn't split their user base with pricey add-ons." [...] Reparaz went on to criticize Sega's decision to release the 32X, noting that [...] "(u)ltimately, the 32X was the product of boneheaded short-sightedness: its existence put Sega into competition with itself once the Saturn rolled out." [...] Writing for IGN, Buchanan also notes that [...] "Notice that we haven't seen many add-ons like the 32X since 1994? I think the 32X killed the idea of an add-on like this—a power booster—permanently. And that's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>Because</b> add-ons, if not implemented properly, just splinter an audience." ...|$|E

5000|$|... “Basically, {{our values}} {{as a people}} are different. Most, if not all, Western sci-fi, from Shelley to Roddenberry, dwells {{a lot on the}} idea of conquering the unknown—a very colonial mindset that echoes the expansionism that the West enjoyed that spurred the {{development}} of sci-fi as a genre in the first place. But Filipino values and sensibilities are different: we’re generally more “inward looking,” as Dominique Cimafranca says. That’s actually <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>because</b> it provides <b>a</b> framework for science fiction that’s still very fresh and mostly unexplored.” ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{her death}} in 2000, Allen Wittenborn, who had met her {{when he was a}} {{graduate}} student at University of Arizona, later returned to her papers in the archives there. From nearly fifty boxes of her papers he edited the volume Dragon in Ambush: The Art of War in the Poems of Mao Zedong (2013), a translation and explication of 20 of Mao's earliest published poems. A reviewer called the volume [...] "an extraordinary work, so full of information that it seems bursting at its roughly 500-page seams. This is not <b>an</b> entirely <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>because</b> the information provided, while often rich and resonant, is also frequently far-fetched and the assemblage of contents is somewhat unusual." ...|$|R

In 1993, amid ongoing negotiations with East West Records, Norwood's parents organized a recording contract with the Atlantic Recording Corporation after auditioning for the company's director of A Darryl Williams. To manage her daughter, Norwood's mother soon resigned from her job, while Norwood herself dropped out of Hollywood High School later, and was tutored privately from tenth grade on. During the early production stages of her debut album, Norwood was selected for a role in the ABC sitcom Thea, portraying the daughter of a single mother played by comedian Thea Vidale. Initially broadcast to high ratings, the series' viewership dwindled and ended up running for only one season, but earned her a Young Artists Award nomination for Outstanding Youth Ensemble alongside her co-stars. Norwood recalled that she appreciated the cancellation of the show as she was unenthusiastic about acting at the time, and the taping caused scheduling conflicts with the recording of her album. She stated, [...] "I felt bad for everybody else but me. It was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>because</b> I could do what I had to do, because I wanted to sing." ...|$|E

Ace {{is known for his}} shiny white smile, his smooth, sultry voice, and having his headphones basically attached to his head. Ace is a strong, charismatic man of very few words, and coveted by every girl in the school, but none more than Maddie. Her long, heartfelt, romantic talks with Ace, imaginary though they may be, are more than proof for her that they're destined to be with each other.|$|R
500|$|In a {{news report}} about this segment that aired on WJBK, Gallagher {{noted that it}} [...] "poked fun at the untrue and unfounded notion that somehow Muslim sharia law {{prevails}} in Dearborn."

Now [...] is addressing this anti-sharia fear mongering issue, and perhaps it may gain some currency and ... more people will make fun of it." [...] The segment was met with mixed reception from students at University of Michigan–Dearborn. A number of them were interviewed by Gallagher in his report. One student said: [...] "It's pretty cool showing how ridiculous the hate is. I think it's pretty funny," [...] while another noted: [...] "I don't think it's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> [...] <b>because</b> we can change it by talking, not making fun." ...|$|R
60|$|I doubt, indeed, {{whether the}} {{earnings}} of literary men are absolutely as great as they were earlier in the century, {{in any of the}} English-speaking countries; relatively they are nothing like as great. Scott had forty thousand dollars for 'Woodstock,' which was not a very large novel, and was by no means one of his best; and forty thousand dollars then had at least the purchasing power of sixty thousand now. Moore had three thousand guineas for 'Lalla Rookh,' but what publisher would be rash enough to pay fifteen thousand dollars for the masterpiece of a minor poet now? The book, except in very rare instances, makes nothing like the return to the author that the magazine makes, and there are few leading authors who find their account in that form of publication. Those who do, those who sell the most widely in book form, are often not at all desired by editors; with difficulty they get a serial accepted by any principal magazine. On the other hand, there are authors whose books, compared with those of the popular favorites, do not sell, and yet they are eagerly sought for by editors; they are paid the highest prices, and nothing that they offer is refused. These are literary artists; and it ought to be plain from what I am saying that in belles-lettres, at least, most of the best literature now first sees the light in the magazines, and most of the second-best appears first in book form. The old-fashioned people who flatter themselves upon their distinction in not reading magazine fiction or magazine poetry make a great mistake, and simply class themselves with the public whose taste is so crude that they cannot enjoy the best. Of course, this is true mainly, if not merely, of belles-lettres; history, science, politics, metaphysics, in spite of the many excellent articles and papers in these sorts upon {{what used to be called}} various emergent occasions, are still to be found at their best in books. The most monumental example of literature, at once light and good, which has first reached the public in book form is in the different publications of Mark Twain; but Mr. Clemens has of late turned to the magazines too, and now takes their mint-mark before he passes into general circulation. All this may change again, but at present the magazines--we have no longer any reviews form the most direct approach to that part of our reading public which likes the highest things in literary art. Their readers, if we may judge from the quality of the literature they get, are more refined than the book readers in our community; and their taste has no doubt been cultivated by that of the disciplined and experienced editors. So far as I have known these, they are men of aesthetic conscience and of generous sympathy. They have their preferences in the different kinds, and they have their theory of what kind will be most acceptable to their readers; but they exercise their selective function with the wish to give them the best things they can. I do not know one of them--and it has been, my good fortune to know them nearly all--who would print a wholly inferior thing for the sake of an inferior class of readers, though they may sometimes decline <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>because</b> for one reason or another, they believe it would not be liked. Still, even this does not often happen; they would rather chance the good thing they doubted of than underrate their readers' judgment.|$|E

50|$|The New Hampshire Archaeological Society (NHAS) began {{excavating}} {{the site}} in 1967 {{with the help of}} a team of volunteers. The excavation of the site continued through 1967 and 1968. One of the volunteers was an archaeologist named Peter McLane who excavated much more of the Neville site than the NHAS had planned on. It was <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>because</b> the Neville site yielded a wealth of archaeological material dating well back into the Archaic period. At first McLane and his sons found only typical artifacts within the first few feet of soil. But as they proceeded to excavate further they found more artifacts. McLane chose to have one of the artifacts dated via charcoal sampling and found that it was 5,385 years old. The ancient date made this artifact one of the oldest artifacts in New England at the time that the sampling was dated. There were other artifacts found, both earlier and later, but these are believed to have been moved to the site from another location.|$|R

50|$|When Elias {{returned}} in disgrace to New York, he composed Cosmopolis, a descriptive piece which somewhat resembles Ottorino Respighi’s The Fountains of Rome. At this time, Elias {{found himself in}} the intensive care unit of a hospital, having suffered a ruptured appendix. Peritonitis had set in, and he was not expected to live. After considerable medical intervention, his life was saved, and he was due to be discharged from the hospital. He said goodbye to everyone, including Anna, the nurses’ orderly on the ward; he asked her in his typically dramatic way, “How can I possibly thank you for giving me back my life?” Anna looked him straight in the eye, and said, “You can marry me.” When Elias told his son John this story, the night before John's marriage, he reached his hand across the table in the bar on Broadway, tousled John's hair, and said, “It’s <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> too, <b>because</b> you were three months along the way.” Anna gave birth to Elias' two sons, John first and Eugene (Gene) two years later.|$|R
5000|$|The {{elephant}} was [...] "seen" [...] at river crossings, during bad weather, after wagons {{ran over}} family members, after deaths, and {{especially at a}} pioneer's first glimpse of one of many roadblocks in the trail ahead. The emigrants discussed the elephant {{in terms of their}} excitement for the outcome of their upcoming journey. They had their eyes on the destination and not always the 2,000 miles that lay between them and their dreamland. The elephant is in many ways a pachyderm of psychological proportions. How the pioneers described him was directly related to how they were feeling. The elephant phrase was early on meant as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> but <b>because</b> it was used in conjunction with an experience that did not turn out as most hoped, the term evolved into a slightly more negative connotation after the Overland Trail period was over. This downbeat view of the elephant due to its connections with the trails more grievous moments is likely what has given the 20th-century historians the opinion that the elephant was mostly a bad experience. The pessimism of the phrase retained this trait throughout much of its historiography.|$|R
40|$|Most {{academic}} and policy commentary represents adverse selection as a severe problem in insurance, which {{should always be}} deprecated, avoided or minimised. This book gives a contrary view. It details the exaggeration of adverse selection in insurers' rhetoric and insurance economics, and presents evidence that in many insurance markets, adverse selection is weaker than most commentators suggest. A novel arithmetical argument shows that from a public policy perspective, 'weak' adverse selection can be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> This is <b>because</b> <b>a</b> degree of adverse selection is needed to maximise 'loss coverage', the expected fraction of the population's losses which is compensated by insurance.
