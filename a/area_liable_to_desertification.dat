40|$|Intercropping sorghum {{with rice}} on <b>areas</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> {{flooding}} {{can provide a}} more reliable harvest, without involving farmers in much extra work. In the Jonglei Province of Southern Sudan, sorghum or maize crops are often partly or entirely lost when low-lying lands get flooded in the wet season. Researchers at the Bor Production Farm {{have been looking for}} a solution by testing the intercropping of sorghum and rice {{over the last three years}} on low-lying land partly subject to flooding. Sorghum and rice were planted together in May, with the sorghum being harvested three to four months afterwards and rice a month later. The rice of course grew well in the water-logged conditions, while the sorghum thrived on drier plots. Several areas which were sometimes flooded and sometimes dry produced both rice and sorghum, the inclusion of rice,in fact, meant that 60 % more grain was produced. Although farmers in the region had never grown rice before, two hundred of them agreed to try the new cropping system. They found that some extra labour was required to plant the rice, but later on there was less need for weeding as the rice quickly made a ground-cover.

40|$|Overbank {{flooding}} {{caused by}} historically high flows, {{such as that}} in the Rio Mundaú watershed (lying between the states of Alagoas and Pernambuco) in 2010, has been the cause of widespread damage. The purpose of work described in this paper was to propose a mapping of <b>areas</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> flooding in the township of Rio Largo (Alagoas) in the Rio Mundaú watershed {{by means of an}} “off-line” coupling of the hydrological/hydraulic models (MGB-IPH/ HEC-RAS), through consideration of extreme floods with different return periods for discharge. The hydrological model had a parameterization appropriate for extreme floods, using as input rainfall data with different return periods. Calibration and validation of the hydrological model were adequate in drainage areas larger than 1500 km 2, but were less acceptable in headwater drainage areas where different geology and soil cover gave rise to surface runoff. The hydraulic model showed good agreement with point observations of flood levels in 2010 in both rural and urban areas along the water-course (R² = 0. 99; RMSE = 1. 41 m and CV (RMSE) = 0. 04). In urban areas distant from the river, however, flood levels were over-estimated, indicating a need to use more detailed Digital Elevation Models. Flood events with return period greater than 50 years have the potential to cause great damage (floods exceeding 0. 46 km 2 in the urban area). The study showed that the use of coupled models was a viable approach for mapping <b>areas</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> flooding, when {{it is not possible to}} analyse local flow frequencies in support of a hydraulic model...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of Urban Heat Island {{is shown by}} an increase in temperature that mostly affects urban areas in comparison with the surrounding rural areas. This increase in temperature becomes problematic during the heat waves when it can give rise to problems of energy and health. The factors affecting this phenomenon are related to the morphology and location of the urban area, to the characteristics of building and roads materials, to the shape of urban structure. The paper investigates the {{phenomenon of}} UHI by analyzing in particular the influence of major urban planning features: the average height of buildings, the building density, the coverage ratio, the percentage of impermeable surface. The study was carried out starting from the analysis of a real case within the Province of Naples. The identification of <b>areas</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> heat islands has been done by working out a thermal map of the Province of Naples through the creation of hyper-spectral satellite images using remote sensing techniques. This map has allowed to select some sample areas within which the main urban planning parameters have been detected through remote sensing techniques or spatial analysis.
