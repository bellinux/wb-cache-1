40|$|Abstract: The <b>antenna</b> <b>factor</b> of the {{biconical}} antenna {{is a function}} of antenna height above a ground-plane. Variations in the <b>antenna</b> <b>factor</b> of up to 1. 9 dB are observed when the antenna is used in the typical height range of 1 m to 4 m on an open area test site (OATS). The magnitude of this variation depends on the impedance of the antenna balun. From the <b>antenna</b> <b>factor</b> simulations we have derived height correction factors which account for the coupling of {{biconical antenna}}s above a groundplane. We have demonstrated with antenna calibration measurements what the simulated predictions show. The new method of height correction can be applied to all measurements with biconical antennas, when the balun impedance of the antenna is known. It removes the systematic error caused by the height dependence of the <b>antenna</b> <b>factor.</b> Examples are demonstrated for precision field strength measurements on an OATS, accuracy enhancement for antenna calibration according to the standard site method given in ANSI C 63. 5 and conversion of OATS antenna factors to free space antenna factors and vice-versa. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Close {{agreement}} between the measured and predicted insertion loss between dipole antennas above a conducting ground plane has produced a calculable standard dipole antenna. Antenna factors of dipole antennas in the frequency range 30 MHz to 500 MHz have been determined to an uncertainty of 60. 1 dB. Though {{the design of the}} dipole is not new, the key achievements are: the use of a large standard ground plane, the use of the program NEC to obtain broadband results, careful design of antennas and supports and precision measurements. Insertion loss and <b>antenna</b> <b>factor</b> are calculated by two independent methods, numerical and analytical, and the results agree to better than 60. 05 dB. The NPL calculable dipole antenna was originally designed for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) applications in the frequency range 30 MHz to 1 GHz, but it can be used wherever electric field strength of free-field signals needs to be precisely measured. The technique was applied to monopole antennas for which <b>antenna</b> <b>factor</b> was determined to an uncertainty of 60. 15 dB over the frequency range 10 MHz to 100 MHz. In this paper, traceability of <b>antenna</b> <b>factor</b> to the predicted value rather than a measured value is justified.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{with the}} performance of different loaded (e. g. inverted L, T, I and C-shaped antennas) and unloaded wire antennas as electromagnetic interference (EMI) sensors. To determine electromagnetic radiation from an electronic component, it is required to evaluate the field strength at a certain distance from it using the sensor. The most common performance descriptor of a sensor is its <b>antenna</b> <b>factor.</b> Here, the method of moments with pulse basis function and point-matching technique has been used to evaluate the current distribution on the antenna surface, and hence, the <b>antenna</b> <b>factor</b> of different wire antennas. The same theory for unloaded antennas has been extended for different loaded-wire antennas. The loaded antennas in transmitting mode are widely used for low-frequency communication. However, while using these antennas as EMI sensors, the extra loading is likely to introduce the reception of cross-polarised component of incident electric field. This paper highlights the results of the initial investigation on the performance of these loaded antennas as EMI sensors in terms of the <b>antenna</b> <b>factor</b> for the desired and cross-polarised component of incident electric field...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} the latest {{techniques}} for validation of anechoic chambers are described. The Short Dipole Site Validation Method (SDSV) {{is based on}} the use of the CISPR 16 dipole in an expanded, non-resonant frequency range. The SDSV idea is great as it combines advantages of the Site Reference method (direct comparison of two site attenuations, no <b>antenna</b> <b>factors</b> involved, quasi-swept frequency scan, fast, volumetric) with advantages of the tuned half-wave dipole method (numerically calculable, very accurate). We have compared site validations done according to the Site Reference Method to SDSV results. Thereby we encountered several disadvantages of this new SDSV procedure. Due to the high <b>antenna</b> <b>factors</b> below the resonance frequency a good dynamic range of the test receiver is required. Another problem is the amount of time needed for the measurements. A set of at least three dipole pairs is required to cover the frequency range from 30 MHz to 1 GHz instead of two broadband antennas. The antenna pattern of dipole and broadband antenna are different this leads to different results in the site validation. For chamber validation the performance of the chamber itself should be checked. Therefore the antenna system for the validation procedure must be calibrated under exactly the same setup conditions (including antenna mast, tripod and antenna cables) as used for site validation. In the numerical simulation of the SDSV reference these influences can not be considered. Finally there is no reason to prefer the SDSV method to the site reference method...|$|R

The antenna is "direct-fed" (no Balun is needed) with optimized dimension to match with 50 Ohm coaxial cable from 200 MHz to 2 GHz. Radiation pattern of the antenna indicates that the common mode current existing on the coaxial cable is negligible. Meanwhile, the biconical antenna has a fixed phase-center for the various frequencies and the related uncertainties can be improved.

40|$|Abstract- The {{accurate}} {{knowledge of}} the <b>antenna</b> <b>factor</b> is a fundamental requirement for reliable electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) measurements in emissions, immunity and human exposure tests. According to international standards, this would imply calibrating antennas in close-to-ideal test sites (calibration test sites), characterized by very large sizes of the ground plane and of the empty space volume above it (free-space behaviour). On the other hand the greater number of EMC test sites is designed for measurements at 3 meters distance, therefore {{it would be very}} convenient to calibrate antennas in such facilities at the cost of an acceptable loss of accuracy. In this paper, the authors investigate on the suitability of compact (standard compliant for measurements at 3 m) semi-anechoic rooms for reliable <b>antenna</b> <b>factor</b> calibrations of EMI antennas. As an example, the calibration of a common broadband biconical antenna in the range 200 MHz- 1 GHz has been considered.
