5|$|Shortly {{after his}} release, the Landlord {{is brought to}} the triad boss, who {{increases}} his offer to HK$30 million for the baby. He finds Thongs and Octopus at the hospital, where the baby is being treated for fever. The Landlord informs the two of the triads' latest offer, but Thongs and Octopus <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the baby's welfare than the cash. However, the two agree to bring the baby to the triad boss' mansion, where the Landlord will meet them {{with the rest of}} the money. They reach the triad boss' mansion and hand over the baby reluctantly. As the trio are about to leave, they hear the baby crying for them as a blood sample is taken from his arm. Thongs and Octopus experience a flashback of the days they spent with the baby. Overcome by their feelings, they fight their way into the triad boss' private amusement park to recover the baby while the Landlord leaves with the money. Thongs almost manages to escape with the baby, but is forced to surrender when the triads threaten to hurl Octopus to his death.|$|E
25|$|Barry causes Colin {{problems}} by interfering with his work, deliberately making him jealous, {{and engaging in}} criminal antics with villainous Nick Cotton (John Altman) leaving Colin {{to pay for the}} damages. Further problems arise when Colin is called for jury service in 1987. The plaintiff {{is a member of the}} gangster organisation known as The Firm, and when Colin refuses to give a verdict of not guilty at the trial, Colin's flat is vandalised by Brad Williams (Jonathan Stratt). Colin calls the police, but they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> Colin's relationship with Barry than catching the vandals. They discover that Barry was under the age of legal sexual consent for gay men when he and Colin began living together, and the police decide to inform Barry's parents (in 1987 the legal age of sexual consent for gay men was 21). Barry is petrified of his homophobic father and decides to end his relationship with Colin.|$|E
25|$|However, some {{obstacles}} remain. ASEAN currently trades {{more with}} other countries (80%) than among its member countries (20%). Therefore, ASEAN economies <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> currency stability against major international currencies, like the US dollar. On macroeconomic conditions, ASEAN member countries have different levels of economic development, capacity, and priorities that translate into different levels of interest and readiness. Monetary integration however implies less control over national monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. Therefore, greater convergence in macroeconomic conditions is being enacted to improve conditions and confidence in a common currency. On the other hand, there are also constraints on the adoption of one currency, such as the following: diversity {{in the level of}} economic development across countries, weaknesses in the financial sectors of many countries, inadequacy of regional-level resource pooling mechanisms and institutions required for forming and managing a currency union, and lack of political preconditions for monetary co-operation and a common currency.|$|E

60|$|It {{might be}} a question, why there are such {{differences}} in religious points, and why these breaches should be more hot and irreconcileable? All the answer I can give to this, is, that we inquire more concerning the truth of religion, than any other nation in the world; and the anxious concern we have about it, makes us jealous of every opinion, and tenacious of our own; {{and this is not}} because we are more furious and rash than other people; but the truth is, we <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> them, and being sensible that the scripture is the great rule of faith, the standard for life and doctrine, we have recourse to it ourselves, without submitting to any pretended infallible judge upon earth.|$|E
