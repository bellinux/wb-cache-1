5|$|Damned to the Netherealm {{after her}} death, Mileena swears fealty to its ruler Shinnok. During {{the events of}} Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), Shao Kahn decides to resurrect Mileena so her skills as a vicious fighter would help him defeat Earth's chosen warriors, also magically {{granting}} her {{the ability to read}} Kitana's thoughts. Shinnok sees {{this as an opportunity to}} covertly monitor the events unfolding in Earthrealm and so he <b>allows</b> <b>her</b> to return to life. After Kahn is defeated, Mileena is summoned back to the Netherealm. In Mortal Kombat Gold (1999), she assists in Shinnok's invasion of Edenia, but <b>allows</b> <b>her</b> sister to escape from a dungeon. Following Shinnok's defeat, Mileena comes to Kitana's palace and demands the power over Edenia be shared with her. Kitana refuses and, when attacked, traps Mileena and locks her away in a dungeon.|$|E
5|$|Alisia {{attacks by}} {{shooting}} streaks of lightning from her hands. The attack automatically targets enemies in range but gets weaker with each volley as Alisia's power is depleted. Her power recharges when she stops attacking; when fully charged, it <b>allows</b> <b>her</b> to unleash a multi-target attack, hitting every enemy on the screen. The energy system introduces {{an element of}} strategy, encouraging the player to manage Alisia's power to have her able to defend herself at critical moments.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Ellie Arroway {{works for}} the SETI program at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Fascinated by science and {{communication}} {{since she was a}} child, she listens to radio emissions from space, hoping to find evidence of alien life. David Drumlin, the president's science advisor, pulls the funding from SETI, because he believes the endeavor is futile. Arroway gains backing from secretive billionaire industrialist S.R. Hadden, which <b>allows</b> <b>her</b> to continue the project at the Very Large Array in New Mexico.|$|E

Medb, queen of Connacht, has mounted the {{invasion}} to steal the stud bull Donn Cúailnge, Cú Chulainn <b>allows</b> <b>her</b> to take Ulster by surprise because he was with a woman when {{he should have been}} watching the border. The men of Ulster were disabled by a curse that caused them to suffer from labor pains. So it becomes Cu Chulainn's job to stop Medb's army from advancing further. He does this by invoking the right of single combat at fords. He defeats champion after champion in a stand-off that lasts for months.|$|E
5|$|Carry {{leaves the}} home that Fenwick has found her and wanders distraught. Eventually, {{she returns to}} the mill, half {{resolved}} to see her old home and then drown herself in the millstream. There she is greeted lovingly by her mother and sister. Her father reluctantly <b>allows</b> <b>her</b> {{to remain in the}} family home; eventually he too forgives her, although he can never forget the shame she has brought on the family. Carry remains with her family {{for the rest of her}} life, but although she has returned to decency, her past ensures that she will never find an honest husband.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy VI is menu-based, {{in which}} the player selects an action {{from a list of}} such options as Fight, Magic, and Item. A maximum of four {{characters}} may be used in battles, which are based on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Under this system, each character has an action bar that replenishes itself at a rate dependent on their speed statistic. When a character's action bar is filled, the player may assign an action. In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability. For example, Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies, while Celes' Runic ability <b>allows</b> <b>her</b> to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn.|$|E
50|$|Dockwise Vanguard is semi-submersible <b>allowing</b> <b>her</b> to lift ships or rigs {{out of the}} water, and {{to place}} them into water. When her ballast tanks are flooded, her deck lies up to 16 m below the surface, <b>allowing</b> <b>her</b> to handle deep draught cargoes. Loads can then be floated above her, and her ballast tanks emptied <b>allowing</b> <b>her</b> to lift and {{transport}} cargoes up to 110,000 tonnes, 50% more than the Blue Marlin.

5|$|Dax confides in Sisko {{that she}} knows she {{is in love with}} her former wife. He tells her that Trill customs mean that if they resumed their relationship, then they would be exiled from their homeworld and their {{symbionts}} would never be joined with a new host, but that she will have his support either way. Kahn and Dax continue to work on the experiment, but it goes wrong and Defiant is severely damaged. Kahn is injured in the explosion, but Dax rigs a force field across a plasma fire that <b>allows</b> <b>her</b> to reach Kahn, coming to the realization that the relationship is worth exile. After returning to the station, Kahn recuperates from her injuries. She decides against resuming her relationship with Dax, and—with the experiments complete—departs with the science team, leaving Dax heartbroken.|$|E

They make their way back to the control room, but the shark appears {{in front of the window}} and smashes through the glass, flooding the room and killing a technician. Michael notices FitzRoyce's corpse still in the shark's throat with a grenade, and uses a bent pole to pull its pin, triggering the grenade's explosion and killing the shark.

Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) says she cannot take Andy's job, but Robert is {{interested}} in her spontaneous behavior. As acting manager, Nellie decides to give everyone performance reviews. Both Jim and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) refuse to let her proceed, as she is unfamiliar with the other employees. To counter this, Nellie offers Dwight a raise on the spot, and eventually, he and the other employees relent, except for Jim. When it is Jim's turn, Jim still refuses.

5|$|Miyuki is {{considered}} one of the strongest magicians in the world and is a candidate to succeed the Yotsuba. Her specialty is freezing magic, and her unique magic <b>allows</b> <b>her</b> to freeze a person's consciousness. In addition, half of her magic casting abilities is used to seal Tatsuya's powers. Before the family vacation in Okinawa, Miyuki treated Tatsuya coldly akin to how the other Yotsuba clan members did. She begins to warm up to him and when Tatsuya saves her life, devotes her existence to him.

5|$|Throughout the game, players {{must find}} and collect items that improve Samus's arsenal and suit, {{including}} weapons, armor upgrades for Samus's Power Suit and items that grant abilitiesincluding the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to compress {{herself into a}} ball in order to roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs, and the Grapple Beam, which works by latching onto special hooks called grapple points, allowing Samus to swing across gaps. Unlike those in earlier games in the series, the beam weapons in Metroid Prime have no stacking ability, in which the traits of each beam merge. Instead, the player must cycle the four beam weapons; there are charge combos with radically different effects for each. Other upgrades include boots that allow Samus to double-jump and a Spider Ball upgrade that <b>allows</b> <b>her</b> to climb magnetic rails.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game takes place underwater. Some pools are inhabited by piranhas that can kill Lara within seconds, while others have streams with currents that can pull her in a fixed direction, preventing the player from being able to swim back or grab onto a ledge. Furthermore, the water in the Antarctica levels is too cold for Lara to swim through {{for more than a few}} seconds. The player can also wade through quicksand, but at the risk of drowning Lara. Some levels require the player to use vehicles. For example, the kayak helps Lara fight her way down rapids in the Madubu Gorge level, while an underwater propeller unit <b>allows</b> <b>her</b> to explore deep water areas in the Lud's Gate level. Other vehicles include a quad bike, a boat, and minecarts. Flares may be used to explore darkened areas. Ammunition, flares, and health recovery items are dispersed among the levels to help players increase their resources. The game also features a tutorial level where the player can practice Lara's moves and combat abilities.|$|E
5|$|Briam tells Kamala {{to stay in}} her quarters, but Captain Picard <b>allows</b> <b>her</b> {{to travel}} {{throughout}} the ship, with the unaffected Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) as her escort. This results in a fight nearly breaking out in Ten Forward, when Kamala begins to interact with several miners. The Ferengi seek to bribe Briam to turn Kamala over to them, but he rejects their offer. As he leaves, they attack him, causing him to fall, hit his head, and lose consciousness. The Enterprise turns the Ferengi over to the nearest starbase to stand trial, but Briam is unable {{to participate in the}} ceremony. Kamala helps Picard to take on Briam's role, and the two become close. He seeks to resist her abilities and tells her to be herself, and she explains that the woman he wants her to be is who she actually is.|$|E
