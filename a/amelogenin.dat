40|$|Tooth enamel biomineralization is {{mediated}} by enamel proteins synthesized by ameloblast cells. Two classes of proteins have been described: enamelins and <b>amelogenins.</b> In lower vertebrates {{the absence of}} <b>amelogenins</b> is believed to give rise to aprismatic enamel; however, rabbit teeth, which apparently do not synthesize <b>amelogenins,</b> form prismatic enamel. The present {{study was designed to}} characterize the enamel proteins present in rabbit tooth organs and to gain an insight into the process of biomineralization. Rabbit enamel extracellular-matrix proteins were isolated and characterized during sequential stages of rabbit tooth organogenesis. The biosynthesis of enamel proteins was analysed by metabolic 'pulse-chase' experiments as well as mRNA-translation studies in cell-free systems. Our results indicated that rabbit enamel extracellular matrix contains 'amelogenin-like' proteins. However, these proteins are not synthesized as typical <b>amelogenins,</b> as in other mammalian species, thus suggesting that they are the processing products of higher-molecular-mass precursors. An N-terminal amino acid sequence of 29 residues, considered characteristic of mammalian <b>amelogenins,</b> was present in the rabbit 'amelogenin-like' proteins. By using anti-peptide antibodies to this region, similar epitopes were detected in all nascent enamel proteins, including enamelins. These studies suggest that the N-terminal sequence might be characteristic of all enamel proteins, not only <b>amelogenins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Amelogenin-mineral {{interactions}} were investigated using an in vitro binding approach. Rat incisor enamel matrix proteins (mainly <b>amelogenins)</b> were dissolved in synthetic enamel fluid {{and allowed to}} equilibrate with deproteinised developing enamel crystals.

5000|$|The <b>amelogenin</b> gene {{has been}} most widely studied in humans, where it is a single copy gene, located on the X and Y {{chromosomes}} at Xp22.1-Xp22.3 and Yp 11.2 5. [...] The <b>amelogenin</b> gene’s location on sex chromosomes has implications for variability both between the X chromosome form (AMELX) and the Y chromosome form (AMELY), and between alleles of AMELY among different populations. This is because AMELY exists in the non-recombining region of chromosome Y, effectively isolating it from normal selection pressures. Other sources of <b>amelogenin</b> variation arise from the various isoforms of AMELX obtained from alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts. Specific roles for isoforms {{have yet to be}} established. Among other organisms, <b>amelogenin</b> is well conserved among eutherians, and has homologs in monotremes, reptiles and amphibians.|$|E

40|$|<b>Amelogenins</b> are {{the most}} {{abundant}} protein species in forming dental enamel, taken to regulate crystal shape and crystal growth. Unprotonated <b>amelogenins</b> can bind protons, suggesting that <b>amelogenins</b> could regulate the pH in enamel in situ. We hypothesized that without <b>amelogenins</b> the enamel would acidify unless ameloblasts were buffered by alternative ways. To investigate this, we measured the mineral and chloride content in incisor enamel of amelogenin-knockout (AmelX(-/-)) mice and determined the pH of enamel by staining with methyl-red. Ameloblasts were immunostained for anion exchanger- 2 (Ae 2), a transmembrane pH regulator sensitive for acid that secretes bicarbonate in exchange for chloride. The enamel of AmelX(-/-) mice was 10 -fold thinner, mineralized in the secretory stage 1. 8 -fold more than wild-type enamel and containing less chloride (suggesting more bicarbonate secretion). Enamel of AmelX(-/-) mice stained with methyl-red contained no acidic bands in the maturation stage as seen in wild-type enamel. Secretory ameloblasts of AmelX(-/-) mice, but not wild-type mice, were immunopositive for Ae 2, and stained more intensely in the maturation stage compared with wild-type mice. Exposure of AmelX(-/-) mice to fluoride enhanced the mineral content in the secretory stage, lowered chloride, and intensified Ae 2 immunostaining in the enamel organ in comparison with non-fluorotic mutant teeth. The results suggest that unprotonated <b>amelogenins</b> may regulate the pH of forming enamel in situ.

40|$|The organic-inorganic {{relationships}} in calf molar immature enamel, and the localization of <b>amelogenins</b> and enamelins in its matrix, {{have been studied}} by post-embedding decalcification and staining (PEDS) method and the immunohistochemical protein A-gold technique, respectively. Filament- and ribbon-like organic structures similar in shape, location and orientation to untreated crystals (crystal ghosts) were shown by PEDS method in immature enamel matrix. Immunohistochemical technique showed that <b>amelogenins</b> were not masked by inorganic substance, because they were reactive both in undecalcified and decalcified sections, gold particles being mainly located at intercrystallite regions; on the contrary, enamelins were masked by inorganic substance because they were reactive only in decalcified sections, gold particles being sometimes closely related to filament- and ribbon-like crystal ghosts. These results are in agreement with those of previous morphologic studies, showing that crystals of immature enamel are organic-inorganic structures, and with biochemical findings suggesting that <b>amelogenins</b> are placed in intercrystallite regions and enamelins in crystallite regions.

40|$|The {{presence}} of collagen in enameloid distinguishes it clearly from true enamel, but {{little is known}} about the phylogenetic relationship between these 2 tissues. It has previously been reported that <b>amelogenins</b> are the principal proteins of the enamel matrix, that type I collagen and chondroitin sulphates are the predominant matrices in dentine, and that amphibian and reptilian aprismatic enamels contain no sulphated glycoconjugates, although certain sulphated substances are secreted into mammalian prismatic enamel during matrix formation. The larval urodele (Triturus pyrrhogaster) teeth are known to be composed of enameloid, dentine, and enamel-like tissue. To characterise the tooth matrices, the localisation of amelogenin-like proteins, type I collagen, and sulphated glycoconjugates was investigated. Chondroitin sulphates and fine fibrils immunoreactive for type I collagen were elaborated as the enameloid matrix inside the dental basement membrane. After the matrix had been deposited in full thickness, coarse collagen fibrils also immunoreactive for type I collagen and chondroitin sulphates were deposited below as the first dentine matrix. Further, enamel-like matrix with no collagen fibrils or sulphated glycoconjugates but strongly immunoreactive for <b>amelogenins</b> was deposited on the dentine. Although no immunolabelling for <b>amelogenins</b> was found over the enameloid matrix, at least at the formation stage, the zone of coarse collagen fibrils of dentine was partially immunoreactive as observed in mammalian mantle dentine.

50|$|The undermineralised, {{immature}} enamel containing long, thin prisms of hydroxyapatite, now matures.

Bcl9 interacts with <b>amelogenin</b> and proteins involved in exocytosis and vesicular trafficking, suggesting that these proteins function in the trafficking or secretion of enamel proteins.

5|$|Enamel's {{primary mineral}} is hydroxyapatite, {{which is a}} {{crystalline}} calcium phosphate.
