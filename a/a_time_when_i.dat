25|$|It is now {{seventeen}} years since I came to serve these princes with the Enterprise of the Indies. They made me pass {{eight of them}} in discussion, {{and at the end}} rejected it as a thing of jest. Nevertheless I persisted therein... Over there I have placed under their sovereignty more land than there is in Africa and Europe, and more than 1,700 islands... In seven years I, by the divine will, made that conquest. At <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was entitled to expect rewards and retirement, I was incontinently arrested and sent home loaded with chains... The accusation was brought out of malice on the basis of charges made by civilians who had revolted and wished to take possession on the land...|$|E
25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E

He stated [...] "I do have dual citizenship, but I think of England as my country. I miss London very much but I couldn't live there because there came <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> needed to be private {{and was forced to}} be public by the press. I couldn't deal with it". He is a supporter of South-East London football club Millwall.|$|E

500|$|By the 1970s Tunis {{felt his}} message had been ignored or {{misunderstood}} by most Americans, saying [...] "Nobody has paid attention... There was <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{expected to do}} some good. But {{that was a long}} while ago." [...] This may seem surprising considering that his New York Times obituary referred to him as a man who [...] "helped educate a whole generation of Americans". Perhaps seen in light of Tunis' distrust of professional athletics, it can be understood. Though he may have felt his message against the commercialization of sports was ignored, there are those who cite Tunis as having made a lasting impact in publishing and to them personally and professionally.|$|E
500|$|African-American {{literature}} scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe calls Angelou's {{depiction of}} the rape [...] "a burden" [...] of Caged Bird: a demonstration of [...] "the {{manner in which the}} Black female is violated in her tender years and... the 'unnecessary insult' of Southern girlhood in her movement to adolescence". Vermillion goes further, maintaining that a Black woman who writes about her rape risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about her race and gender. When asked decades later how she was able to survive such trauma, Angelou explained it by stating, [...] "I can't remember <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wasn't loved by somebody." [...] When asked by the same interviewer why she wrote about the experience, she indicated that she wanted to demonstrate the complexities of rape. [...] She also wanted to prevent it from happening to someone else, so that anyone who had been raped might gain understanding and not blame herself for it.|$|E

[...] "He {{was one of}} the best I’d ever seen," [...] Willie Davis, a defensive end who played for the Browns shortly after Lavelli retired, said. [...] "He set the mold with his running patterns and catching the ball." [...] After Lavelli died, Graham praised his abilities and remembered his eagerness to get his hands on the ball. [...] "He was always coming into the huddle and telling me he was open and that I should throw to him," [...] Graham said. [...] "He wasn't saying that to be a big shot. He just loved to play. If he was open by a few inches, he'd be yelling, 'Otto, Otto.' Many <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was stuck and heard that voice I would throw it in his direction and darned if he didn't come down with it. He had fantastic hands." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Joel H. Cohen, {{and it was his}} first sole writing credit for a Treehouse of Horror episode. He {{previously}} wrote the [...] "Hex and the City" [...] segment of season 13's [...] "Treehouse of Horror XII". Bob Anderson served as director. It was his third Treehouse of Horror episode, the first two being season seven's [...] "Treehouse of Horror VI" [...] and season 20's [...] "Treehouse of Horror XIX". Daniel Radcliffe, star of the Harry Potter film series, guest starred as Edmund in the third segment which parodies the Twilight novel and film series. Radcliffe said that he is a fan of the show and guest starring is [...] "a huge honour. The Halloween episode has become a big tradition in The Simpsons so I'm very excited to be part of it. There was <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was 12 or 13 when 50 percent of everything I knew about the world came from The Simpsons, so this is a big deal."

500|$|In 1665, Bashō and Yoshitada {{together}} with some acquaintances composed a hyakuin, or one-hundred-verse renku. In 1666, Yoshitada's sudden death brought Bashō's peaceful {{life as a}} servant to an end. No records of this time remain, but {{it is believed that}} Bashō gave up any possibility of samurai status and left home. Biographers have proposed various reasons and destinations, including the possibility of an affair between Bashō and a Shinto miko named , which is unlikely to be true. Bashō's own references to this time are vague; he recalled that [...] "at one time I coveted an official post with a tenure of land", and that [...] "there was <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was fascinated with the ways of homosexual love": there is no indication whether he was referring to real obsessions or fictional ones. He was uncertain whether to become a full-time poet; by his own account, [...] "the alternatives battled in my mind and made my life restless". His indecision may have been influenced by the then still relatively low status of renga and haikai no renga as more social activities than serious artistic endeavors. In any case, his poems continued to be published in anthologies in 1667, 1669, and 1671, and he published a compilation of work by himself and other authors of the Teitoku school, , in 1672. In about the spring of that year he moved to Edo, to further his study of poetry.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Kakha Kaladze's brother Levan, {{a medical}} student, was kidnapped in Georgia, with a ransom of $600,000 demanded. Georgia's {{president}} at the time, Eduard Shevardnadze, promised that [...] "everything {{is being done to}} locate him". Despite this assurance, the only time that Levan was ever seen was in a video where he was shown blindfolded and begging for help. Following the kidnapping, Kaladze threatened to take up Ukrainian citizenship, but reverted his decision, stating, [...] "There was <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> thought about quitting the national side completely, but I couldn't do it out of respect for the Georgian people and the fans who come and give us such support." [...] Roughly four years later, on 6 May 2005, Georgian police officers found eight dead bodies in the Svaneti region and it was speculated that Levan was among the dead. On 21 February 2006, Levan was officially identified among the deceased, after tests from FBI experts. The local media claimed that the ransom was paid by Kaladze's family, although another source says that Kaladze's father attempted to meet the kidnappers, who fled as they believed he was followed by the police. Two men were sentenced to prison for the murder: David Asatiani for 25 years and Merab Amisulashvili for five years. On 14 July 2009, Kaladze's wife Anouki gave birth to their first-born son in Milan. The couple named their son Levan, in memory of Kaladze's brother.|$|E

2500|$|Coinciding {{with the}} public's outpouring of grief in {{reaction}} to Lennon's death, the single was a top-ten hit in many {{countries around the world}} and became Harrison's most successful single since [...] "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)" [...] in 1973. Among the people he thanked on the inner sleeve of Somewhere in England was Yogananda, and he dedicated the album to Lennon's memory with a quote from Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita: [...] "There was never <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> did not exist, nor you. Nor will there be any future when we cease to be." [...] The quote was followed by Lennon's initials and accompanied by both the Hindu Om symbol and a Christian cross.|$|E

2500|$|Closing track, [...] "Tomorrow's Food", was {{the first}} song written for the album.

I’d been off at Harvard for a while and Brandon was really focusing on painting and for a little while there we didn’t have all that much communication. I just sort of wrote that guitar part, the chord progression and the changes and stuff and Brandon just sort of responded to it. We kind of just put it aside and then when we started working on new music for this album, I think we always knew that we wanted to record it in the studio and make it really great. But that actually was one of the last things that we did for this album." ...|$|E
