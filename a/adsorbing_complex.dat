40|$|The {{parameters}} of Cu 2 +, Pb 2 + and Zn 2 + adsorption by chernozems {{of the south}} of Russia and their particle-size fractions were studied. The adsorption capacity of chernozems for Cu 2 +, Pb 2 +, and Zn 2 + depending on the particle-size distribution decreased in the following sequence: clay loamy ordinary chernozem ~ clay loamy southern chernozem > loamy southern chernozem > loamy sandy southern chernozem. According to the {{parameters of}} the adsorption by the different particle-size fractions (Cmax and k), the heavy metal cations form a sequence analogous to that obtained for the entire soils: Cu 2 + ≥ Pb 2 + > Zn 2 +. The parameters of the heavy metal adsorption by similar particle-size fractions separated from different soils decreased in the following order: clay loamy chernozem > loamy chernozem > loamy sandy chernozem. The ratio between the content of exchangeable cations displaced from the soil <b>adsorbing</b> <b>complex</b> (SAC) into the solution and the content of adsorbed HMs decreased with the increasing concentration of adsorbed HMs. These values could be higher (for Cu 2 + and Pb 2 +), equal, or lower than 1 (for Zn 2 +) and depend on the properties of HMs. At the first case, this was due to the dissolution of readily soluble salts at low HM concentrations in the SAC. In the latter case, this was related to the adsorption of associated forms HMs and the formation of new phases localized on the surface of soil particles at high HM concentrations in the SAC...|$|E

Using both static first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics, we perform a comprehensive adsorption study of several salt and solvent species at the interface of Mg metal with an electrolyte of Mg^ 2 + and Cl^- dissolved in liquid tetrahydrofuran (THF). Our findings not only provide {{a picture of the}} stable species at the interface, but also explain how this system can support reversible Mg deposition and as such we provide insights in how to design other electrolytes for Mg plating and stripping. The active depositing species are identified to be (MgCl) ^+ monomers coordinated by THF, which exhibit preferential adsorption on Mg compared to possible passivating species (such as THF solvent or neutral MgCl_ 2 complexes). Upon deposition, the energy to desolvate these adsorbed complexes and facilitate charge-transfer is shown to be small (∼ 61 - 46. 2 kJ mol^- 1 to remove 3 THF from the strongest <b>adsorbing</b> <b>complex),</b> and the stable orientations of the adsorbed but desolvated (MgCl) ^+ complexes appear favorable for charge-transfer. Finally, observations of Mg-Cl dissociation at the Mg surface at very low THF coordinations (0 and 1) suggest that deleterious Cl incorporation in the anode may occur upon plating. In the stripping process, this is beneficial by further facilitating the Mg removal reaction...|$|E

The reconnaissance of the territory vocation needs the research of its peculiarities which determine the uniqueness of that production area. In particular, the Cinque Terre area, represents one of the most impressive example of coastal stepped landscape in the Mediterranean and is covered almost completely by vineyards of the famous denomination “DOC Cinque Terre (150 ha) : Bianco Cinque Terre e lo Sciacchetrà. However, the boundaries of this appellation have been established based on administrative borders of the municipality while for the definition of the terroir particular consideration is given to natural elements as climate, soil and geomorphology.

We extracted some topographic characteristics as slope, aspect, altitude. These are successively overlaid with the map of the area registered in the vineyard of the DOC, mapped by GPS.

40|$|To {{explore the}} proper-ties of cyclodextrins (CDs) as an optical sensing phase, the {{behavior}} of immobilized CD in interaction with analytes was studied in this work. CDs having different cavity sizes were immobilized {{onto the surface of}} infrared (IR) internal reflection-sensing element (IRE) to kinetically monitor {{the behavior of}} CD in interaction with analytes. Several aromatic compounds having various molecular sizes and functional groups were used to characterize the interaction mechanism. A two-layer modification method was proposed in this work, which utilized a thin hydrophobic film (polyvinyl benzyl chloride) to stick on the IRE and to covalently bond to the CDs through an ethylene diamine linker. The synthesized CD phases exhibited high stability in aqueous solution. To analyze the behavior during the formation of complexes between the guest molecules and the CD phases, we modeled the interaction behavior and treated the kinetic data with the theoretical equations developed in this work. The results indicate that the behavior of the interaction between guest molecules and CDs was explained by considering the formation of two types of complexes: <b>adsorbed</b> <b>complexes</b> and inclusion complexes. The formation of the inclusion complexes was relatively fast, the time required to reach equilibrium could be shorter than a few minutes.

Due {{to the importance of}} dynamic considerations in the interpretation of the electrochemical signal, the principles and recent developments of kinetic features in the interconversion of metal complex species will be presented. As dynamic electrochemical methods, only stripping techniques (anodic stripping voltammetry and stripping chronopotentiometry) will be used because they are the most important for the determination of trace elements. Competitive ligand ex- change-adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry, which should be considered an equilibrium technique rather than a dynamic method, will be also discussed because the complexing parameters may be affected by some kinetic limitations if equilibrium before analysis is not attained and/or the flux of the <b>adsorbed</b> <b>complex</b> is in fluenced by the lability of the natural complexes in the water sample. For a correct data interpretation and system characterization the comparison of results obtained from different techniques seems essential in the articulation of a serious discussion of their meaning...|$|R
40|$|Overlayer {{thin films}} of vinylbipyridine (vbpy) -containing Ru and Zn {{complexes}} {{have been formed}} on top of ruthenium dye <b>complexes</b> <b>adsorbed</b> to TiO 2 by reductive electropolymerization, The goal was to create an efficient, water-stable photoelectrode or electrodes. An adsorbed-[Ru(vbpy) (2) (dcb) ](PF 6) (2) /poly-[Ru(vbpy) (3) ](PF 6) (2) surface composite displays excellent stability toward dissolution in water, but the added overlayer film greatly decreases incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) in propylene carbonate with I- 3 (-) /I- as the carrier couple. An ads[Ru(vbpy) (2) (dcb) ](PF 6) (2) /poly-[Zn(vbpy) (3) ](PF 6) (2) composite displays no loss in IPCE compared to ads-[Ru(vbpy) (2) (dcb) ](PF 6) (2) but is susceptible to film breakdown {{in the presence of}} water by solvolysis and loss of the cross-linking Zn 2 + ions. Success was attained with an ads-[Ru(vbpy) (2) (dcb) ](PF 6) (2) /poly-[Ru(vbpy) (2) (dppe) ](PF 6) (2) composite. In this case the electropolymerized layer is transparent in the visible. The composite electrode is stable in water, the IPCE in propylene carbonate with I- 3 (-) /I- is comparable to the <b>adsorbed</b> <b>complex,</b> and a significant IPCE is observed in water with the quinone/hydroquinone carrier couple.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{selective}} {{and sensitive}} method for simultaneous determination of copper in blood by adsorptive differential pulse cathodic stripping voltammetry is presented. The procedure involves an adsorptive accumulation of Cu(II) -ETSC (4 -ethyl- 3 -thiosemicarbazide) on a hanging mercury drop electrode, {{followed by a}} stripping voltammetry measurement of reduc-tion current of <b>adsorbed</b> <b>complex</b> at about − 715 mV. The optimum conditions {{for the analysis of}} copper (II) ion are: pH 10. 3, concentration of 4 -ethyl- 3 -thiosemicarbazide 3. 25 × 10 − 6 M and an accumulation potential of − 100 mV. The peak current is proportional to the concentration of copper over the range 0. 003 − 125 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0. 001 ng/mL and an accumulation time of 60 s. Moreover, {{with the use of the}} proposed method, there is a considerable improvement in the detec-tion limit, the linear dynamic range and the deposition time, compared with the methods of adsorptive stripping voltammetry for the determination of copper. The developed method was validated by analysis of whole blood certified reference materials.
