40|$|Thermal {{tetrachloroethene}} (PCE) remediation by {{steam injection}} in a sandy aquifer {{led to the}} release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from aquifer sediments resulting in more reduced redox conditions, accelerated PCE biodegradation, and changes in microbial populations. These changes were documented by comparing data collected prior to the remediation event and eight years later. Based on the premise that dual C-Cl isotope slopes reflect ongoing degradation pathways, the slopes associated with PCE and TCE suggest the predominance of biotic reductive dechlorination near the source area. PCEwas the predominant chlorinated ethene near the source area prior to thermal treatment. After thermal treatment, c DCE became predominant. The biotic contribution to these changes was supported by the presence of Dehalococcoides sp. DNA (Dhc) and Dhc targeted rRNA close to the source area. In contrast, dual C-Cl isotope analysis together with the almost absent VC 13 C depletion in comparison to c DCE 13 C depletion suggested that c DCE was subject to <b>abiotic</b> <b>degradation</b> due to the presence of pyrite, possible surface-bound iron (II) or reduced iron sulphides in the downgradient part of the plume.

40|$|Plakohopanoid, a {{new type}} of hopanoid {{derivative}} composed of a C 32 hopanoid acid ester linked to a mannosylmyo- inositol, was isolated from the sponge Plakortis cf. lita as its peracetyl derivative. Its structure was determined by a combination of spectroscopic analysis and microscale chemical degradation. Even though plakohopanoid was isolated from a sponge, its component parts are clearly of bacterial origin, and its bacterial biosynthesis is very likely. Until now, C 32 hopanoic acids have been considered to be geohopanoids, i. e., diagenetic products that are formed through <b>abiotic</b> <b>degradation</b> of the biohopanoids present in bacteria. The presence of plakohopanoid in a marine living organism shows that there is a biosynthetic pathway to C 32 hopanoic acids, and these substances should therefore no longer with certainty be considered to be geohopanoids...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Removal of {{triclocarban}} (TCC) and triclosan (TCS) from wastewater is {{a function}} of adsorption, <b>abiotic</b> <b>degradation,</b> and microbial mineralization or transformation, reactions that are not currently controlled or optimized in the pollution control infrastructure of standard wastewater treat-ment. Here, we report on the levels of eight transformation products, human metabolites, and manufacturing byproducts of TCC and TCS in raw and treated sewage sludge. Two sample sets were studied: samples collected once from 14 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) representing nine states, and multiple samples collected from one WWTP monitored for 12 months. Time-course analysis of significant mass fluxes (α = 0. 01) indicate that transformation of TCC (dechlorination) and TCS (methylation) occurred during sewage conveyance and treatment. Strong linear correlations were found between TCC and the human metabolite 2 ′-hydroxy-TCC (r = 0. 84), an...|$|E
30|$|Based on {{the high}} energy of the carbon–fluorine bond [2], it can be assumed that short-chain PFAAs are {{extremely}} persistent similar to the persistence of long-chain PFAAs [38, 39]. They do not undergo <b>abiotic</b> or biotic <b>degradation</b> at all under environmental conditions and are considered highly stable transformation products in which several precursors ultimately degrade into [13, 40]. This extreme persistence is regarded as an incalculable hazard itself, as short-chain PFAAs will stay in the environment for decades to centuries [41]. The possible risks of such extremely persistent organic fluorochemicals for humans and the environment have been emphasized by leading scientists [16, 17]. Each released PFAS molecule remains in the environment, meaning {{that it is impossible}} to reverse exposure. Thus, levels of these substances will most probably increase over time in certain compartments. As a consequence, long-term effects on humans and wildlife may be possible in the future, when certain effect thresholds are reached.|$|R
30|$|The {{accumulation}} of humic substances in soil (the so called “humification”) is, therefore, a dynamic process, {{by which the}} heterogeneous byproducts of <b>abiotic</b> and biotic <b>degradation</b> of animal and plant tissues (lipids, peptides, oligosaccharides, etc.), are no longer covalently linked in implausible branched humic macropolymers of ever growing molecular masses. Instead, these are progressively protected from complete mineralization in weakly bound superstructures by the increasing concentration of hydrophobic components. These are thermodynamically excluded from water and, therefore, are no longer bioaccessible for mineralization. At the same time, this reservoir of “humic” molecules hydrophobically adsorbed on soil clay and chemically sorbed by oxides may again be released to the soil solution when exposed to conformational alterations due to root-exuded organic acids or to microbial degradation. This plant- and microbes-mediated equilibria between solid and liquid phases is the governing process of soil chemical and physical fertility. In fact, it provides the mobile “humic” molecules which play a bioactive role in plant growth, stabilize soil structure by forming organo-mineral complexes, and control the transport down the soil profile of organic matter and humic-bound contaminants.|$|R
40|$|Original {{extracts}} from an unpublished 1958 experiment {{conducted by the}} late Stanley L. Miller were recently found and analyzed using modern state-of-the-art analytical methods. The extracts were produced {{by the action of}} an electric discharge on a mixture of methane (CH 4), hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), ammonia (NH 3), and carbon dioxide (CO 2). Racemic methionine was farmed in significant yields, together with other sulfur-bearing organic compounds. The formation of methionine and other compounds from a model prebiotic atmosphere that contained H 2 S suggests that this type of synthesis is robust under reducing conditions, which may have existed either in the global primitive atmosphere or in localized volcanic environments on the early Earth. The presence of a wide array of sulfur-containing organic compounds produced by the decomposition of methionine and cysteine indicates that in addition to <b>abiotic</b> synthetic processes, <b>degradation</b> of organic compounds on the primordial Earth could have been important in diversifying the inventory of molecules of biochemical significance not readily formed from other abiotic reactions, or derived from extraterrestrial delivery...|$|R
