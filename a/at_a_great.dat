5|$|Nash {{was picked}} for Tasmania in two matches against the touring South Africans in January 1932. He failed {{to perform in}} the first match in Launceston, taking 1/68 and 2/45 and scoring 17 and 9. However, Nash had a lively bowling {{performance}} in the Hobart match, making the ball come off the wicket <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> pace and gaining match figures of 9/137, including two wickets in consecutive balls and breaking batsman Eric Dalton's jaw with a vicious bouncer on the hat-trick ball. South African captain Jock Cameron praised Nash for his performance as his bowling in the match {{was thought to be}} as quick and dangerous as any bowler in the world.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October 1728, a {{few weeks}} after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford as a fellow-commoner. The {{inheritance}} did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit. Corbet left Pembroke soon after Johnson arrived, so this source of aid disappeared. To meet the expenses, Michael Johnson allowed his son to borrow a hundred books from his bookshop, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> cost to himself, and these books were not fully returned to Michael until many years later.|$|E
5|$|Takanohana won {{his first}} tournament in over two years in January 2001, winning his first {{fourteen}} bouts and then defeating fellow yokozuna Musashimaru in a playoff on the final day. He won his final championship in May 2001, again in a playoff against Musashimaru, but it came <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> cost. He had suffered serious knee ligament damage in a loss to Musōyama on the 14th day but he insisted on fighting on {{to the end of}} the tournament. As a result, he then missed an unprecedented seven consecutive tournaments, undergoing surgery in Paris in July 2001 and having a lengthy recuperation after that.|$|E

5|$|The Western Pacific Railroad line, {{part of the}} Feather River Route, that {{parallels}} the cut-off was built between 1906 and 1907, filling a causeway with rock and gravel <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> cost. Along the route across the Great Salt Lake Desert, the railroad served the communities of Arinosa, Barro, and Salduro, which were also served by the new road. The Union Pacific Railroad merged with the Missouri Pacific Railroad and the Western Pacific in December 1982.|$|E
5|$|Two limited {{editions of}} the globe were made in Berlin in the mid 1930s, one for the Nazi Party and another for German {{dictator}} Adolf Hitler himself. The one made for the Führer was nearly {{the size of a}} Volkswagen car and manufactured <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> expense. It changed Abyssinia (today's Ethiopia) to Italian East Africa. The other was made of standard wood with no special features. The actual number of globes produced cannot be verified as the factory that produced the globe, along with its archives, was destroyed in air raids in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Study of Saturn's moons {{has also}} been aided by {{advances}} in telescope instrumentation, primarily the introduction of digital charge-coupled devices which replaced photographic plates. For the entire 20th century, Phoebe stood alone among Saturn's known moons with its highly irregular orbit. Beginning in 2000, however, three dozen additional irregular moons have been discovered using ground-based telescopes. A survey starting in late 2000 and conducted using three medium-size telescopes found thirteen new moons orbiting Saturn <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> distance, in eccentric orbits, which are highly inclined to both the equator of Saturn and the ecliptic. They are probably fragments of larger bodies captured by Saturn's gravitational pull. In 2005, astronomers using the Mauna Kea Observatory announced the discovery of twelve more small outer moons, in 2006, astronomers using the Subaru 8.2m telescope reported the discovery of nine more irregular moons, in , Tarqeq (S/2007 S 1) was announced and in May {{of the same year}} S/2007 S 2 and S/2007 S 3 were reported.|$|E

5|$|In September 1916, the Serbian High Command sent then-Lieutenant Pećanac by air to Mehane (south-west of Niš in the Toplica region) {{to prepare}} a guerrilla {{uprising}} {{in support of a}} planned Allied offensive. There, Pećanac contacted several groups of guerrillas, known as comitadji. Pećanac joined forces with local leader Kosta Vojinović, and they both established headquarters on Mount Kopaonik. Rivalry quickly developed between the two leaders, mainly because Pećanac only had orders to prepare to support the planned Allied offensive, but Vojinović was conducting operations that might result in pre-emptive action by the Bulgarian occupation forces. Matters came to a head in January– February 1917 when the Bulgarians began conscripting local Serbs for military service. At a meeting of guerrilla leaders to discuss whether they should commence a general uprising, Pećanac was outvoted. However, events had overtaken the leaders, and they were essentially joining a popular uprising that was already underway. After guerrillas under Pećanac's command engaged the Bulgarians, he was hailed as a leader of the resistance, although he had serious reservations about the eventual outcome once the Bulgarians and Austro-Hungarians committed large numbers of troops to subdue the uprising. The guerrillas were closing on Niš in early March when the occupying forces went on the offensive. Pećanac advised his fighters to hide out in the woods and mountains, while Vojinović ordered his to fight to the death. By 25 March, the uprising had been crushed. Pećanac's participation in the rebellion came <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> personal cost; three of his children died whilst in Bulgarian internment.|$|E

40|$|The {{diagnostic}} efficacy of an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) using gonococcal pili 6650 as antigen was studied in asymptomatic women attending an STD clinic. Of the 182 women studied, gonorrhoea was diagnosed in 29 %. The value of the ELISA was calculated {{on the basis of}} four arbitrary cut-off points in the test. The best predictive values for a positive result (PV(+)) were obtained <b>at</b> <b>an</b> absorbance value of <b>A</b> <b>greater</b> than or equal to 1. 15 and <b>A</b> <b>greater</b> than or equal to 1. 30 and that for <b>a</b> negative result <b>at</b> <b>A</b> <b>greater</b> than or equal to 0. 85. When patients with a history of gonorrhoea were excluded, the PV(+) rose only <b>at</b> <b>A</b> <b>greater</b> than or equal to 1. 15 (not <b>at</b> <b>A</b> <b>greater</b> than or equal to 1. 30) and the PV(-) rose slightly. To be of use in the diagnosis of gonorrhoea in asymptomatic patients the ELISA should be used as follows: the result is positive <b>at</b> <b>A</b> <b>greater</b> than or equal to 1. 15 and negative <b>at</b> <b>A</b> less than 0. 85, the PV(+) then being 0. 52 and the PV(-) 0. 85.

At the estuary of the river dwelt the Beormas, who unlike the nomadic Sami peoples were sedentary, and their land was rich and populous.

This was <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> meeting of the freeholders and farmers of Yorkshire convened by the king on Heworth Moor on 3 June near York.

Disadvantages of co-generation systems include slow ramping up and down rates, high cost and short lifetime.

25|$|Comet Hale-Bopp {{was arguably}} the most widely {{observed}} comet of the 20th century, {{and one of the}} brightest seen for many decades and it was {{visible to the naked eye}} for a record 18 months when it passed near planet Earth. Hale-Bopp was discovered by Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp on July 23, 1995 <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> distance from the Sun, raising expectations that the comet would brighten considerably by the time it passed close to Earth. Although predicting the brightness of comets with any degree of accuracy is very difficult, Hale-Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997.|$|E
