40|$|International audienceMachine Learning (ML) {{approaches}} are increasingly used to model data coming from sensor networks. Typical ML implementations are cpu intensive {{and are often}} running server-side. However, IoT devices provide increasing cpu capabilities and some classes of ML algorithms are compatible with distribution and downward scalability. In this demonstration we explore the possibility of distributing ML tasks to IoT devices in the sensor network. We demonstrate a concrete scenario of appliance recognition where a smart plug provides electrical measures that are distributed to WiFi nodes running the ML algorithms. Each node estimates class-conditional probabilities that are then merged for recognizing the <b>appliance</b> <b>category.</b> Finally, our architectures relies on Web technologies for complying with Web-of-Things paradigms...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{and global}} warming indices for ten major {{appliances}} have been examined. A two-page summary report for each <b>appliance</b> <b>category</b> has been written {{as well as a}} combined summary for major appliances. The appliances studied are: refrigerators, room air conditioners (RACs), freezers, gas ranges, electric ranges, microwave ovens, clothes washers, gas dryers, electric dryers, and dishwashers. This report contains copies of the summary reports, bibliographical data, assumptions, and data tables developed by this investigation. Computational spreadsheets have been developed that allows new data to be easily incorporated for future reports. In general terms, most major appliance categories have reduced energy requirements over the past two decades. At the same time, increased appliance production causes overall energy demand {{and global warming}} effects to remain relatively constant. "Direct" global warming effects decrease significantly after the year 2010 as appliances using chlorinated refrigerants (primarily R 11 and R 12) are scrapped...|$|E
30|$|In Fig.  6, {{there are}} three devices in the IST: the air conditioner, lamp, and {{electric}} blanket. To show {{a large amount of}} data and various services involved, the smart devices that are most often used in a household were selected from the smart <b>appliance</b> <b>category.</b> The air conditioner transmits the current indoor temperature to the server and the user’s usage patterns and data are learned simultaneously in IE 2 S to select a suitable temperature level. As a result, an optimal indoor temperature can be maintained through air conditioning. The lamp adjusts its intensity and operating status according to the current time and {{the presence or absence of}} a user indoors, and the user’s usage patterns are analyzed to maintain the optimal values. The electric blanket checks the user’s body temperature and the indoor temperature, and it continuously collects and analyzes the increase and decrease adjustments made by the user to provide the optimal temperature.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We asset {{about the}} {{analysis}} of electrical appliance consumption signatures for the identification task. We apply Hid-den Markov Models to appliance signatures for the identification of their category and of the most probable sequence of states. The electrical signatures are measured at low frequency (101 Hz) and are sourced from a specific database. We follow two predefined protocols for providing comparable results. Recovering informa-tion on the actual appliance state permits to potentially adopt energy saving measures, as switching off stand-by appliances or, generally speaking, changing their state. Moreover, {{in most of the}} cases appliance states are related to user activities: the user interaction usually involves a transition of the appliance state. Information about the state transition could be useful in Smart Home / Building Systems to reduce energy consumption and increase human comfort. We report the results of the classification tasks in terms of confusion matrices and accuracy rates. Finally, we present our application for a real-time data visualization and the recognition of the <b>appliance</b> <b>category</b> with its actual state...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} effects of carbon fibers on consumer {{products such as}} dishwashers, microwave ovens, and smoke detectors were investigated. The investigation was divided into two categories to determine the potential faults and hazards that could occur if fibers should enter the electrical circuits of the selected <b>appliances.</b> The <b>categories</b> were a fault analysis and a hazard analysis. Hazards considered were fire, flood, physical harm, explosion, and electrical shock. Electrical shock {{was found to be}} a possible occurrence related to carbon fibers. Faults were considered to be any effect on the performance of an appliance which would result in complaint or require service action...|$|R
40|$|Electricity {{consumption}} in the United Kingdom is continually growing with demand from the domestic sector a potential/major contribution to this increase in consumption. Although demand is increasing, little information exists on the domestic components that contribute {{to an increase in}} domestic energy consumption. Thus, a greater understanding on what is contributing to the increase in domestic energy usage is a pre-requisite to understand how it can be reduced in the future or, if not reduced, contained at its current level. This article discusses a separation filter designed for disaggregating domestic electrical demand data into different <b>appliance</b> <b>categories.</b> The filter is applied to a real time domestic electrical dataset spanning 1 Â year, and trends in standby, cold, heating element spikes and residual demand are identified. Several reasons to account for each of the trends are discussed. Additionally, the filter is applied to synthetic data both to confirm the accuracy of the separation filter and to finely adjust the filter for future application. The results indicate an increase in occupancy-related demand consumption during the winter months and an increase in cold consumption during the summer months. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that in contrast to changes observed in occupancy-related demand and cold consumption, there is little variation in standby and heating element spike consumption throughout the year. Finally, the potential advantage of incorporating a tailored separation filter into domestic smart meters is discussed. Domestic Electrical demand Power Appliances Energy Demand profiles...|$|R
40|$|People are {{constantly}} inventing and adopting new energy-using devices {{to make their}} lives more comfortable, convenient, connected, and entertaining. This study aggregated 134 energy-using household devices, excluding major <b>appliances,</b> into <b>categories</b> based on the energy service they provide. By 2006, there were 43 energy-using devices in the average U. S. household that used over 4, 700 kWh of electricity, natural gas, and gasoline. A fixed effects panel model {{was used to examine}} the relationship of demand for energy-using devices to energy price, household income, and the cost of these devices. This analysis found that the elasticity of demand for these devices with respect to energy price was - 0. 52 with a 90 % confidence interval of - 1. 04 to - 0. 01. The elasticity of demand to income was 0. 52 with a 90 % confidence interval of - 0. 42 to 1. 46. The cost of these devices is also statistically significant...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} of these tankers (a tanker {{is a type}} of fire appliance) is the dual cab Category 1 Tanker, which is mainly used in a {{combination}} of rural and urban/interface roles ('interface' meaning where built-up areas meet bushland). The next most common fire <b>appliances</b> are <b>Category</b> 7 tankers which are used to support heavier appliances in fire fighting operations as well as being a primary appliance themselves. They are also used where rugged terrain prevents heavy tankers access or where it is far too dangerous to take a heavier appliance. Single and dual cab and <b>Category</b> 9 <b>appliances</b> are most often used as rapid intervention vehicles (thus the name 'Striker') to attack small and spot fires quickly before they are able to spread as Strikers are much faster than heavy, medium and light tankers. Strikers are disadvantaged as they carry limited water. <b>Category</b> 9 <b>appliances</b> are also used to patrol an almost extinguished fire for flare-ups and can 'mop-up' small hot spots.|$|R
40|$|In the paper, the {{division}} of domestic <b>appliances</b> into <b>categories</b> connected with input power was presented. The authors discussed issues connected with energy efficiency of these devices. An {{example of such a}} device power consumption of which affects considerably on overall power consumption from the mains is a vacuum cleaner. Vacuum cleaners are used in almost all households and they were covered by the EU regulations which introduced limitations in power consumption from the mains. In the paper, the assessment of energy efficiency of classic electric motors for vacuum cleaners drive was presented. Results of practical tests of chosen vacuum cleaners were presented. The digital power meter was used to measure electric parameters of tested vacuum cleaners and the PC was used to collect measuring data. The assessment of input power influence on energy consumption and energy efficiency was conducted based on tests results. It was shown in conclusions that the one of development directions of domestic appliances, which can cause improvement of energy efficiency, are alternative technologies of electric machines with much higher efficiency i. e. energy-saving electric machines with electronic commutation...|$|R
30|$|So, this Section is {{organised}} as follows. In Subsection Technologies we {{survey the}} main available technologies {{in the relevant}} fields, and evaluate whether – and to which extent – {{they can be used}} for our purposes. Then (in the Subsection Logical architecture of a possible Butlers platform) we present the logical architecture of a possible Butlers system implementation, discussing the relationship between the properties of the architectural components and the features that the system can consequently be expected to provide. As a next step, we commit to a specific coordination technology and infrastructure (TuCSoN) as the technology of choice to concretise our Butlers logical architecture: we summarise its basics and discuss how its main metaphors – tuple centres – can be exploited to effectively provide the kind of flexible and extensible support needed by our architecture. The consequent TuCSoN-based implementation is discussed in Section TuCSoN for Butlers. Then, to be even more concrete, we take a small, but significant, sub-system and present its prototype implementation. Finally, we discuss the conceptual roadmap towards a real Butlers system: starting from the prototype, we discuss how, and to which extent, its limitations could be overcome with respect to all the relevant aspects – namely, home <b>appliances,</b> users <b>categories,</b> policies, configuration issues, and the butler itself.|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} a primary focus on energy {{efficiency}} may {{not be sufficient to}} slow (and ultimately reverse) the growth in total energy consumption and carbon emissions. Instead, policy makers need to return to an earlier emphasis on "conservation," with energy efficiency seen as a means rather than an end in itself. We briefly review the concept of "intensive" versus "extensive" variables (i. e., energy efficiency versus energy consumption), and why attention to both consumption and efficiency is essential for effective policy in a carbon- and oil-constrained world with increasingly brittle energy markets. To start, energy indicators and policy evaluation metrics need to reflect energy consumption as well as efficiency. We introduce the concept of "progressive efficiency," with the expected or required level of efficiency varying as a function of house size, appliance capacity, or more generally, the scale of energy services. We propose introducing progressive efficiency criteria first in consumer information programs (including <b>appliance</b> labeling <b>categories)</b> and then in voluntary rating and recognition programs such as ENERGY STAR. As acceptance grows, the concept could be extended to utility rebates, tax incentives, and ultimately to mandatory codes and standards. For these and other programs, incorporating criteria for consumption as well as efficiency offers a path for energy experts, policy-makers, and the public to begin building consensus on energy policies that recognize the limits of resources and global carrying-capacity. Ultimately, it is both necessary and, we believe, possible to manage energy consumption, not just efficiency in order to achieve a sustainable energy balance. Along the way, we may find it possible to shift expectations away from perpetual growth and toward satisfaction with sufficiency...|$|R
40|$|Building {{on prior}} discussions at ACEEE Summer Studies and elsewhere, {{we argue that}} today’s primary focus on energy {{efficiency}} may {{not be sufficient to}} slow (and ultimately reverse) the growth in total energy consumption and carbon emissions.
