25|$|Only the {{dismissal}} {{of most of the}} cases by Acting United States Secretary of Labor Louis Freeland Post limited the number of deportations to 556. Fearful of extremist violence and revolution, the American public supported the raids. Civil libertarians, the radical left, and legal scholars raised protests. Officials at the Department of Labor, especially Post, asserted the rule of law in opposition to Palmer's anti-radical campaign. Post faced a Congressional threat to impeach or censure him. He successfully defended his actions in two days of testimony before the House Rules Committee in June 1919 and no action was ever taken against him. Palmer testified before the same committee, also for two days, <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> the raids, arrests, and deportation program. Much of the press applauded Post's work at Labor, while Palmer, rather than President Wilson, was largely blamed for the negative aspects of the raids.|$|E

25|$|King Sigismund I the Old died on 1 April 1548. Sigismund Augustus, who briefly {{returned}} to Vilnius, {{had to travel}} back to Kraków to attend the funeral and secure himself on the Polish throne. Barbara stayed in Vilnius.

Since it is known only from Radziwiłł reports, it is unknown whether it was a real pregnancy or another intrigue. In September 1548, Sigismund Augustus invited Barbara to Poland to show the strength of their marriage. The issue was discussed by the general sejm on 31 October – 12 December in Piotrków Trybunalski. The sessions were loud and rowdy. The nobles, including voivodes Piotr Kmita Sobieński, Jan Gabriel Tęczyński, and Piotr Boratyński, pleaded the King to abandon the marriage and even threatened to take up arms. Sigismund Augustus steadfastly refused <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> his wife; reportedly he even considered abdication. The sejm ended in a stalemate.|$|E
25|$|In {{heavy seas}} on 8 July 1948 a French steamer {{by the name}} of Francois Tixier Bound from Goole to the French inland port of Rouen, got into {{difficulties}} of the north Norfolk coast four miles (6km) off Sheringham. The steamer was laden with a cargo of coal and in worsening gale she capsized.

Despite the attempts by the crew to secure the cargo, it shifted further to port. With their failed attempts to steady the vessel the captain and crew agreed to leave their ship. One crew man jumped into the water and was rescued; another reached the lifeboat by rope passed between the boats. Using a Breeches buoy, eight more of the crew were rescued. After the eleventh crewman was rescued using the breeches buoy the stricken steamer rolled over and began to sink. The last five remaining crew scrambled on to the stern and as the steamer slipped below the waves they scrambled on to a raft and were picked up by the lifeboat shortly after. The sixteen rescued French seaman were landed at Great Yarmouth by the Henry Blogg. In recognition of their efforts Coxswain Henry Davies and his crew were presented with awards by the French government.|$|E
