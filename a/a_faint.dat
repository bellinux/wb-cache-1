5|$|In 2006 a dwarf galaxy, {{also named}} Coma Berenices, was {{discovered}} in the constellation. The galaxy is <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> satellite of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The small moon Dia, 4 {{kilometres}} in diameter, {{had gone}} missing since its discovery in 2000. One {{theory was that}} it had crashed into the much larger moon Himalia, 170 kilometres in diameter, creating <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> ring. This possible ring appears as <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> streak near Himalia in images from NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto. This suggests that Jupiter sometimes gains and loses small moons through collisions. However, the recovery of Dia in 2010 and 2011 disproves the link between Dia and the Himalia ring, although {{it is still possible}} that a different moon may have been involved.|$|E

5|$|All Russulaceae, {{including}} the corticioid species, are characterised by spherical to elliptic basidiospores with <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> to very distinct (e.g. warty, spiny, or crested) ornamentation that stains bluish-black with Melzer's reagent (an amyloid stain reaction). Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are usually club-shaped and four-spored. Russulaceae species {{do not have}} clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|Atomic {{hydrogen}} {{has also}} been detected in Callisto's atmosphere via recent analysis of 2001 Hubble Space Telescope data. Spectral images taken on 15 and 24 December 2001 were re-examined, revealing <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> signal of scattered light that indicates a hydrogen geocorona. The amount of hydrogen present in Callisto's atmosphere varies depending {{on the stage of}} its orbit.|$|E
5|$|Immature {{birds have}} duller and less demarcated plumage. The head is a sooty black, {{sometimes}} with <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> greenish sheen and brown feather bases visible; {{the back and}} side of the neck are dark grey and the underparts greyish or sooty black. The tail has narrower feathers and a greenish sheen.|$|E

5|$|The {{three main}} rings are the narrow Adams Ring, 63,000km from {{the centre of}} Neptune, the Le Verrier Ring, at 53,000km, and the broader, fainter Galle Ring, at 42,000km. <b>A</b> <b>faint</b> outward {{extension}} to the Le Verrier Ring has been named Lassell; it is bounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring at 57,000km.|$|E
5|$|A second death, {{less than}} a week later, forced {{authorities}} to reconsider the cause of Nickell's death. On June 11, Susan Snow, a 40-year-old Auburn bank manager, took two Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules for an early-morning headache. Snow's husband, Paul Webking, took two capsules from the same bottle for his arthritis and left the house for work. At 6:30 am, the Snows' fifteen-year-old daughter found Susan Snow collapsed on the floor of her bathroom, unresponsive and with <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> pulse. Paramedics were called and transported Snow to Harborview Medical Center, but she died later that day without regaining consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary system can not yet be ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star. From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E

5|$|Antlia is <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> constellation; its {{brightest}} star is Alpha Antliae, an orange giant {{that is a}} suspected variable star, ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. S Antliae is an eclipsing binary star system, changing in brightness as one star passes {{in front of the}} other. Sharing a common envelope, the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star. Two star systems with known exoplanets, HD 93083 and WASP-66, lie within Antlia, as do NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy, and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{north of}} the block, a glass column is sited in a {{reflecting}} pool. The column is internally illuminated by fibre optic cables with <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> blue light, symbolising the blue lamp which traditionally hangs outside police stations in the United Kingdom. The column is intended to screen the vitrine from passing traffic on The Mall. The column is 7.4m high, consisting of 622 stacked sheets of glass (a total surface area of 954m2), weighing 28.6 tonnes.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Walter Sydney Adams, using a 60-inch (1.5m) {{reflector}} at Mount Wilson Observatory, {{observed the}} spectrum of Sirius B and determined that it was <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> whitish star. This led astronomers to conclude {{that it was a}} white dwarf, the second to be discovered. The diameter of Sirius A was first measured by Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss in 1959 at Jodrell Bank using their stellar intensity interferometer. In 2005, using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers determined that Sirius B has nearly the diameter of the Earth, , with a mass 102% of the Sun's.|$|E

5|$|In the Local Supercluster it is {{possible}} to see star clusters, and current telescopes could in principle observe faint individual stars in the Local Group (see Cepheids). However, outside the Local Supercluster of galaxies, neither individual stars nor clusters of stars have been observed. The only exception is <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> image of a large star cluster containing hundreds of thousands of stars located at a distance of one billion light years—ten times further than the most distant star cluster previously observed.|$|E
5|$|Lacaille gave Bayer designations to ten stars now named Alpha to Lambda Pyxidis, {{skipping}} the Greek letters iota and kappa. Although a nautical element, {{the constellation}} {{was not an}} integral part of the old Argo Navis and hence did not share in the original Bayer designations of that constellation, which were split between Carina, Vela and Puppis. Pyxis is <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> constellation, its three brightest stars—Alpha, Beta and Gamma Pyxidis—form a rough line. Overall, there are 41 stars within the constellation's borders with apparent magnitudes brighter than or equal to 6.5.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} discoveries was that the comet had a third type of tail. In addition to the well-known gas and dust tails, Hale–Bopp also exhibited <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> sodium tail, only visible with powerful instruments with dedicated filters. Sodium emission had been previously observed in other comets, but had not been shown to come from a tail. Hale–Bopp's sodium tail consisted of neutral atoms (not ions), and extended to some 50 million kilometres in length.|$|E

5|$|The Lassell ring, {{also known}} as the plateau, is the {{broadest}} ring in the Neptunian system. It is the namesake of William Lassell, the English astronomer who discovered Neptune's largest moon, Triton. This ring is <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> sheet of material occupying the space between the Le Verrier ring at about 53,200km and the Arago ring at 57,200km. Its average normal optical depth is around 10−4, which corresponds to an equivalent depth of 0.4km. The ring's dust fraction is in the range from 20% to 40%.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} ring of Neptune {{is called}} the Galle ring after Johann Gottfried Galle, {{the first person to}} see Neptune through a telescope (1846). It is about 2,000km wide and orbits 41,000–43,000km from the planet. It is <b>a</b> <b>faint</b> ring with an average normal optical depth of around 10−4, and with an equivalent depth of 0.15km. The fraction of dust in this ring is estimated from 40% to 70%.|$|E
5|$|The {{plane of}} the Milky Way passes through Pyxis. <b>A</b> <b>faint</b> constellation, its three {{brightest}} stars—Alpha, Beta and Gamma Pyxidis—are in a rough line. At magnitude 3.68, Alpha is the constellation's brightest star. It is a blue-white star around 22,000 times as luminous as the Sun. Near Alpha is T Pyxidis, a recurrent nova that has flared up to magnitude 7 every few decades. Three star systems have planets, all discovered by doppler spectroscopy.|$|E
