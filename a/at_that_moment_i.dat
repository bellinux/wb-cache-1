5|$|Eight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight short, simple words....For {{a part of}} {{a second}} I glimpsed my mother and my sisters moving away to the right. Tzipora held Mother's hand. I saw them {{disappear}} into the distance; my mother was stroking my sister's fair hair...and I did not know that in that place, <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> was parting from my mother and Tzipora forever.|$|E
5|$|We {{went into}} the booth to record the song. She {{originally}} {{wanted to do a}} Mike Skinner thing, rapping the verse and singing the chorus. But I asked her to sing it all, and she just made up the whole melody on the spot, and sang this amazing solo. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> realised that this girl has a really special gift.|$|E
25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment!</b> <b>I</b> cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E

5000|$|It’s not a {{survival}} horrormoment, but {{the beginning of}} the game Another World made me feel like I had really been swallowed and dropped alone on a vast, new world. That scene had a deep impact on me, and it was <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> first began to consider the potential games had for stirring an emotion like fear in the player.

500|$|While {{fronting}} the band, Dickinson {{also came}} across Iron Maiden {{for the first}} time, who were supporting Samson at the Music Machine in 1980. As Dickinson recalls; [...] "I was watching them, and they were good, really fucking good, and <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> remember thinking, 'I wanna fucking sing for that band. In fact, I'm going to sing for that band! I know I'm going to sing for that band!' ... I just thought, 'This is really me. Not Samson.'" ...|$|E
500|$|William Petit {{had been}} able to free himself, escape his confines, and call to a {{neighbor}} for help. The neighbor indicated that he did not recognize him due to the severity of Petit's injuries. In court testimony, William Petit stated that he felt a [...] "jolt of adrenaline" [...] coupled with a need to escape upon hearing one of the perpetrators state: [...] "Don't worry, it's going to be all over in a couple of minutes." [...] Petit then told the jury, [...] "I thought, it's now or never because in my mind <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> {{thought they were going to}} shoot all of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Rodman {{experienced}} a tough loss when coach Chuck Daly, {{whom he had}} admired as a surrogate father, resigned in May; Rodman skipped the preseason camp and was fined $68,000. The following 1992–1993 season was even more tumultuous. Rodman and Annie Bakes, {{the mother of his}} daughter Alexis, were divorcing after a short marriage, an experience which left him traumatized. The Pistons won only 40games and missed the 1993 NBA Playoffs entirely. One night in February 1993, Rodman was found asleep in his car with a loaded rifle. Four years later in his biography As Bad As I Wanna Be, he confessed having thought about suicide and described that night as an epiphany: [...] "I decided that instead [...] I was gonna kill the impostor that was leading Dennis Rodman to a place he didn't want to go... So I just said, 'I'm going to live my life the way I want to live it and be happy doing it.' <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> tamed [...] my whole life around. I killed the person I didn't want to be." [...] The book was later adapted for a TV movie Bad As I Wanna Be: The Dennis Rodman Story. Although he had three years and $11.8million remaining on his contract, Rodman demanded a trade. On October 1, 1993, the Pistons dealt him to the San Antonio Spurs.|$|E
60|$|Martin gave in handsomely, I'll admit, and I am {{confident}} <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> if <b>I</b> had asked permission to pull {{one of his}} teeth, {{he would not have}} denied me.|$|R

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the outbreak, many did not believe that the disease existed. [...] "I thought it was a lie (invented) to collect money because <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> hadn´t seen people affected in my community." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the later}} 1960s, Nikkatsu began losing its {{audience}} to TV, and its film production dropped. At this time, assistant directors {{moved on to}} TV or non-film work. In order {{to find a new}} audience, Nikkatsu president Takashi Itamochi made the decision to put the company's high production values and professional talent entirely into the [...] "pink-film" [...] (softcore pornographic) industry, which had until then been made by independent and low-budget filmmakers like Kōji Wakamatsu. Many of Nikkatsu's staff either did not return to the studio or left, not wanting to make sex films. Konuma had no such reservations, however, later saying, [...] "The pleasure of becoming a director was greater than anything else <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment...</b> <b>I</b> was just happy to be making movies." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{revealed}} afterwards that Suárez had written {{as part of}} his defence that [...] "I lost my balance, making my body unstable and falling on top of my opponent. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> hit my face against the player, leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth". Chiellini said he hoped FIFA would reduce the suspension that had been imposed. Uruguay captain Diego Lugano claimed the ban was [...] "barbarity" [...] and [...] "a breach of human rights", while the AUF described it as [...] "excessive" [...] and [...] "severe", and claimed that it [...] "feels like Uruguay has been thrown out of the World Cup". Suárez showed contrition after the ban was given, saying [...] "I deeply regret what occurred", and vowed to never bite anybody again.|$|E
60|$|Gui. I change, 'tis true, because I {{love you}} still; Love you, O heaven, {{even in my}} own despite; I tell you all, even <b>at</b> <b>that</b> very <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> know you {{straight}} betray me to the king.|$|R

60|$|<b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> when <b>I</b> {{was my own}} lonely self again, {{the sight}} of the child soothed and {{attracted}} me. I advanced, intending to speak to her. To my horror I suddenly ceased to see her. She disappeared as if I had been stricken blind.|$|R
2500|$|The papal nuncio, the Most Rev. Giovanni Tonucci, said at Father Kaiser’s {{funeral in}} the Nairobi basilica, [...] "The church, through pitiless violence, has once more been {{deprived}} {{of one of her}} ministers. Let no one have any doubts about it: we are celebrating a religious occasion; we are reflecting on a religious assassination, not a political one. Fr. Kaiser has been murdered because he was, and in the eternity of God still is, a Catholic priest who preached the Gospel. Those who killed him, those who planned his killing, wanted to silence the voice of the Gospel.... Only two days before his death, I met Fr. Kaiser for a long conversation. At the end, he asked my blessing, which I reluctantly gave him. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> thought {{it would have been better}} if he, an old and worthy missionary, had blessed me. How much more I am convinced of that now that we look at him as a martyr of the faith?". Also present at the altar was Maurice Cardinal Otunga, Archbishop Emeritus of Nairobi.|$|E
2500|$|Sullivan praised Elvis {{at the end}} of the show, saying [...] "This is a real decent, fine boy. We've {{never had}} a pleasanter {{experience}} on our show with a big name than we've had with you.... You're thoroughly all right"—a remark that could either be interpreted as a [...] "ringing endorsement" [...] that [...] "legitimized the singer with an adult audience" [...] or as [...] "a somewhat hypocritical statement considering what the CBS censors had just done to his performance on that show." [...] Eyewitness Jerry Schilling writes, [...] "The way Elvis looked out at us <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> thought I could see a mix of hurt over the attacks he’d been subjected to in the press, and a deep pride in who he was and what he was doing." [...] (According to historian Tim Parrish, Presley's manager, Colonel Parker, [...] "had threatened to remove Elvis from the show if Sullivan did not apologize for telling the press that Elvis's 'gyrations' were immoral.") Reflecting on the event in 1969, Presley claimed that Sullivan had expressed a very different opinion off-camera: [...] "So they arranged to put me on television. At that particular time there was a lot of controversy—you didn't see people moving—out in public. They were gettin' it on in the back rooms, but you didn't see it out in public too much. So there was a lot of controversy ... and I went to the Ed Sullivan Show. They photographed me from the waist up. And Sullivan's standing over there saying, 'Sumbitch.' I said, 'Thank you, Ed, thank you.' I didn't know what he was calling me, at the time." ...|$|E

6000|$|So {{she dropped}} the lump into my lap just <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> and <b>I</b> clapped my legs {{together}} on it and she went on talking. But only about a minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face, and very pleasant, and says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{should you}} call me a traitor?"

60|$|Perhaps if you {{had searched}} Greenwood and all the {{adjacent}} districts thoroughly you might have found {{a man who was}} more astonished and taken aback than old John Ellis was <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> but <b>I</b> doubt it.

60|$|It {{would be}} difficult, even impossible, {{to set down}} in writing my sensations <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment.</b> All <b>I</b> can {{particularly}} recall is that I laughed, though neither from a spirit of bravado nor from hysteria.
