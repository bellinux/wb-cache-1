25|$|From {{the death}} of Augustus (14 AD) until after 70 AD, Rome {{accepted}} as her Germanic frontier the water-boundary of the Rhine and upper Danube. Beyond these rivers she held only the fertile plain of Frankfurt, opposite the Roman border fortress of Moguntiacum (Mainz), the southernmost slopes of the Black Forest and a few scattered bridge-heads. The northern section of this frontier, where the Rhine is deep and broad, remained the Roman boundary until the empire fell. The southern part was different. The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily crossed. The frontier which they form is inconveniently long, enclosing an <b>acute-angled</b> wedge of foreign territory between the modern Baden and Württemberg.

60|$|Their {{procedure}} was to toss their hooks and bait {{over the rail}} from shelter and slowly to pay the lines out as the slight windage of the Elsinore's hull, spars, and rigging drifted her through the water. When a bird was hooked they hauled in the line, still from shelter, till it was alongside. This was the ticklish moment. The hook, merely a hollow and <b>acute-angled</b> triangle of sheet-copper floating {{on a piece of}} board {{at the end of the}} line, held the bird by pinching its curved beak into the acute angle. The moment the line slacked the bird was released. So, when alongside, this was the problem: to lift the bird out of the water, straight up the side of the ship, without once jamming and easing and slacking. When they tried to do this from shelter invariably they lost the bird.|$|E

50|$|The Moser spindle {{requires}} four {{colors in}} any graph coloring: in any three-coloring {{of one of}} the two rhombi from which it is formed, the two <b>acute-angled</b> vertices of the rhombi would necessarily have the same color as each other. But if the shared vertex of the two rhombi has the same color as the two opposite <b>acute-angled</b> vertices, then these two vertices have the same color as each other, violating the requirement that the edge connecting them have differently-colored endpoints. This contradiction shows that three colors are impossible, so at least four colors are necessary. Four colors are also sufficient to color the Moser spindle, a fact that follows for instance from the fact that its degeneracy is three.|$|E

50|$|Accusations of ‘facadism’ seem dated, {{given how}} many Constructivist-influenced {{features}} of Spa Green have become staples of postmodern architecture - {{not only the}} floating roof canopy but the red/grey colour scheme, the stairwells marked by repeated clusters of square 'windows', and the <b>acute-angled</b> canted meeting lodge (originally the caretaker’s flat), which emerges from Sadler House surreally fitted with traditional multipane and bow windows. Lubetkin’s decorative Modernism is surprisingly contextualist, establishing visual continuity with the extant terraces (whose rusticated stucco is echoed in the small service building adjoining St John St). Already in 1945 Lubetkin explained the S-curve of the future Sadler House as meant to create 'a more organic link' to the Rosebery Avenue terrace houses. This carefully studied siting of the buildings obviates Pevsner’s complaint about randomness.|$|E

50|$|The first {{generation}} Tata Indigo {{was launched in}} 2002, and was largely based on the Indica. The two cars shared a majority of their parts. The Indigo had a greater wheelbase than the Indica, to hold the more <b>acute-angled</b> C-pillar, and the trunk. The front bumper had housing for fog-lamps, a feature which the Indica lacked at the time. While the Indica featured a 1.4L 55 HP diesel engine, the Indigo featured its turbocharged variant, which produced 68 HP of maximum power. The car was also offered with a 1.2L 4-cylinder MPFI petrol (gasoline) engine, which put out 68 HP of power. The interiors of the Indigo featured a few exclusives over the Indica, such as HVAC on all variants, power-windows for all doors on the top-variant, and fabric upholstery on all variants. The acute angle of the C-pillar, compared to the Indica, meant that the Indigo lacked a rear windshield wiper. A minor design refresh in 2004 introduced a new 1.4L TDI turbocharged diesel engine (not related to the similarly-named TDI family of diesel engines by Volkswagen).|$|E

50|$|The spire is {{high and}} conical with {{slightly}} concave slopes. The apex is broken. On the upper whorls the longitudinals are strong, while the spirals are obsolete, except the carinal fillet, which projects bluntly above the suture. The 14 whorls show a very regular increase. They are very slightly convex, sharply <b>acute-angled</b> at the carina. The base of the shell is flat at the outer edge and barely convex in the middle, with a slight dip in {{toward the edge of}} the umbilicus which is strongly defined. The suture is linear, defined by the white carinal fillet, and also on the lower whorls by being very slightly impressed. The aperture is perpendicular, rhomboidal, the basal and palatal lines being parallel, the other two are somewhat diverging and curved, broader than high. The outer lip is sharp and thin, not patulous, not descending, with a shallow open sinus below the suture, then, about the middle of the whorl, it advances with a rounded sweep, retreating sharply across the carina to form the open rounded basal sinus toward the outer edge of the base. The columellar lip is sharp and thin. It rises from the body a good way within the edge of the umbilicus. It retreats so as to form a sinus, and then it bends over a little on the umbilicus, and it forms a sharp angle projecting into a tooth at the extreme point of the pillar. The umbilicus is strong, deep, abrupt, there being on the base only a very slight dip in toward it and it is defined by the white-beaded fillet. Within, besides the two spiral lines, there are slight longitudinal striations, and the inner edge of the whorls twines like a staircase round it, but concealed by the overcurve of the columellar lip.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has examined the}} factors controlling the geometrical configuration of bifurcations, determined the range of stability conditions {{for a number of}} bifurcation types and assessed the impact of perturbations on bifurcation evolution. However, the flow division process and the parameters that influence flow and sediment partitioning are still poorly characterized. To identify and isolate these parameters, three-dimensional velocities were measured at 11 cross-sections in a fixed-walled experimental bifurcation. Water surface gradients were controlled, and systematically varied, using a weir in each distributary. As may be expected, the steepest distributary conveyed the most discharge (was dominant) while the mildest distributary conveyed the least discharge (was subordinate). A zone of water surface super-elevation was co-located with the bifurcation in symmetric cases or displaced into the subordinate branch in asymmetric cases. Downstream of a relatively <b>acute-angled</b> bifurcation, primary velocity cores were near to the water surface and against the inner banks, with near-bed zones of lower primary velocity at the outer banks. Downstream of an obtuse-angled bifurcation, velocity cores were initially at the outer banks, with near-bed zones of lower velocities at the inner banks, but patterns soon reverted to match the <b>acute-angled</b> case. A single secondary flow cell was generated in each distributary, with water flowing inwards at the water surface and outwards at the bed. Circulation was relatively enhanced within the subordinate branch, which may help explain why subordinate distributaries remain open, {{may play a role in}} determining the size of commonly-observed topographic features, and may thus exert some control on the stability of asymmetric bifurcations. Further, because larger values of circulation result from larger gradient disadvantages, the length of confluence-diffluence units in braided rivers or between diffluences within delta distributary networks may vary depending upon flow structures inherited from upstream and whether, and how, they are fed by dominant or subordinate distributaries.
