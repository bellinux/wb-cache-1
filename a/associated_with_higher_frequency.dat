This paper proposes three ‘indicators of abstraction ’ which might provide indications of childrens developing conceptualisations. The indicators related to children’s descriptions of their calculations are ‘metaphor’, ‘expression of generality ’ and ‘method’. Each has three categories of abstraction. Data drawn from a study with 7 to 9 year old children suggests that responses categorised as ‘representative ’ and ‘symbolic ’ are associated with high levels of accuracy whilst lower accuracy is more often <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> of ‘concrete ’ responses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Associations between {{hours worked}} per week and Body Mass Index (BMI), food intake, {{physical}} activity, {{and perceptions of}} eating healthy at work were examined {{in a sample of}} transit workers. Methods Survey data were collected from 1086 transit workers. Participants reported hours worked per week, food choices, leisure-time physical activity and perceptions of the work environment with regard to healthy eating. Height and weight were measured for each participant. Multivariate linear and logistic regressions were conducted to examine associations between work hours and behavioral variables. Associations were examined in the full sample and stratified by gender. Results Transit workers working in the highest work hour categories had higher BMI and poorer dietary habits, with results differing by gender. Working 50 or more hours per week was associated with higher BMI among men but not women. Additionally, working 50 or more hours per week was significantly <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> of accessing cold beverage, cold food, and snack vending machines among men. Working 40 or more hours per week was <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> of accessing cold food vending machines among women. Reported frequency of fruit and vegetable intake was highest among women working 50 or more hours per week. Intake of sweets, sugar sweetened beverages, and fast food did not vary with work hours in men or women. Physical activity and perception of ease of eating healthy at work were not associated with work hours in men or women. Conclusions Long work hours were associated with more frequent use of garage vending machines and higher BMI in transit workers, with associations found primarily among men. Long work hours may increase dependence upon food availability at the worksite, which highlights the importance of availability of healthy food choices. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Case {{management}} {{has been a}} widely accepted approach to practice in various care settings. This study aimed to explore how community aged care case managers allocated their time to case management functions, how frequently they performed specific case management activities, and what factors influenced the frequency of their activities. Methods: The study involved 154 survey participants, or 17. 1 % of the target case managers in the State of Victoria, Australia. Key information collected included participants’ socio-demographic characteristics, proportions of time allocated to six core case management functions, and frequency ratings of 41 specific activities within seven case management functions. Ordinal regression analyses were performed to determine significant factors associated with participants’ frequency ratings of their activities. Results: Participants allocated the largest proportion of time to care coordination (22. 0 %), and the smallest proportion of time to outcome evaluation (8. 0 %). Over 70 % of the participants assigned high frequency ratings to 31 of the 41 case management activities. The remaining ten activities, including all four outcome evaluation activities, three needs assessment activities, one care planning activity, one care coordination activity, and one general functions-related activity were less commonly performed very frequently. The regression analyses indicated that some case manager and client factors {{were significantly associated with}} frequency ratings of nine of the ten activities aforementioned. The two main findings of the regression analyses were: First, emphasising achieving more case management goals was significantly <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> of three outcome evaluation activities; second, longer work experience was significantly <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> of one care coordination activity and one outcome evaluation activity. Conclusions: The frequent performance of most case management activities and relative absence of factors influencing their frequency suggest a uniformity of practice in community aged care case managers’ practice. What is not clear is whether the frequency of these activities (in particular less frequent performance of outcome evaluation activities) conforms to expectations...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective: The study {{examined}} the impact of precol-lege drinking intentions on college heavy episodic drinking (HED) {{in a sample of}} women making the transition from high school to college.

Method: High school seniors (n = 416) recruited from the community were assessed at the time of high school graduation {{and at the end of}} the fi rst and second semesters of college. Results: The hypothesized model was supported. After controlling for high school HED, precollege drinking intentions predicted fi rst semester descriptive and injunctive social norms and social pressure to drink.

40|$|An {{important}} {{issue in the}} control of practical systems {{is the effect of}} model uncertainty on closed loop performance.

Digital simulations of a single-link manipulator system are employed to demonstrate that passive damping added to the flexible member reduces adverse effects associated with model uncertainty. A controller was designed based on a model including only one flexible mode. This controller was applied to larger order systems to evaluate the effects of modal truncation. Simulations using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) design assuming full state feedback illustrate the effect of control spillover. Simulations of a system using output feedback illustrate the destabilizing effect of observation spillover. The simulations reveal that the system with passive damping is less susceptible to these effects than the untreated case...|$|E
