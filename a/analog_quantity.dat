Most partitioning methods use statistic analysis to find the threshold value and then to determine {{the size of a}} module.

40|$|Synapses exhibit an {{extraordinary}} degree of short-term malleability, with release probabilities and effective synaptic strengths changing markedly over multiple timescales. From {{the perspective of}} a fixed computational operation in a network, this seems like a most unacceptable degree of added variability. We suggest an alternative theory according to which short-term synaptic plasticity plays a normatively-justifiable role. This theory starts from the commonplace observation that the spiking of a neuron is an incomplete, digital, report of the <b>analog</b> <b>quantity</b> that contains all the critical information, namely its membrane potential. We suggest that a synapse solves the inverse problem of estimating the pre-synaptic membrane potential from the spikes it receives, acting as a recursive filter. We show that the dynamics of short-term synaptic depression closely resemble those required for optimal filtering, and that they indeed support high quality estimation. Under this account, the local postsynaptic potential and the level of synaptic resources track the (scaled) mean and variance of the estimated presynaptic membrane potential. We make experimentally testable predictions for how the statistics of subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations and the form of spiking non-linearity should be related to the properties of short-term plasticity in any particular cell type. ...|$|E

40|$|Building on {{evidence}} for working memory (WM) coding of vibro-tactile frequency information in monkey prefrontal cortex, recent electroencephalography studies found frequency processing in human WM to be reflected by quantitative modulations of prefrontal upper beta activity (20 – 30 Hz) {{as a function}} of the to-be-maintained stimulus attribute. This kind of stimulus-dependent activity has been observed across different sensory modalities, suggesting a generalized role of prefrontal beta during abstract WM processing of quantitative magnitude information. However, until now the avail-able empirical evidence for such quantitative WM representation remains critically limited to the retention of periodic stimulus fre-quencies. In the present experiment, we used retrospective cueing to examine the quantitative WM processing of stationary (intensity) and temporal (duration) attributes of a previously presented tactile stimulus. We found parametric modulations of prefrontal beta activity during cued WM processing of each type of quantitative information, in a very similar manner as had before been observed only for periodic frequency information. In particular, delayed pre-frontal beta modulations systematically reflected the magnitude of the retrospectively selected stimulus attribute and were functionally linked to successful behavioral task performance. Together, these findings converge on a generalized role of stimulus-dependent pre-frontal beta-band oscillations during abstract scaling of <b>analog</b> <b>quantity</b> information in human WM...|$|E
40|$|High-speed and {{high-resolution}} digital-to-analog converters (DACs) {{are vital}} components in all telecommunication systems. Radio-frequency digital-to-analog converter (RFDAC) provides high-speed and high-resolution conversion from digital domain to an analog signal. RFDACs {{can be employed}} in direct-conversion radio transmitter architectures. The idea of RFDAC is to utilize an oscillatory pulse-amplitude modulation instead of the conventional zero-order hold pulse amplitude modulation, which results in DAC output spectrum to have high energy high-frequency lobe, other than the Nyquist main lobe. The frequency of the oscillatory pulse can be chosen, {{with respect to the}} sample frequency, such that the aliasing images of the signal at integer multiples of the sample frequency are landed in the high-energy high-frequency lobes of the DAC frequency response. Therefore the high-frequency images of the signal can be used as the output of the DAC, i. e., no need to the mixing stage for frequency up-conversion after the DAC in the radio transmitter. The mixing stage however is not eliminated but it is rather moved into the DAC elements and therefore the local oscillator (LO) signal with high frequency should be delivered to each individual DAC element. In direct-conversion architecture of IQ modulators which utilize the RFDAC technique, however, there is a problem of finite image rejection. The origin of this problem is the different polarity of the spectral response of the oscillatory pulse-amplitude modulation in I and Q branches. The conditions where this problem can be alleviated in IQ modulator employing RFDACs is also discussed in this work. ΣΔ modulators are used preceding the DAC in the transmitter chain to reduce the digital signal’s number of bits, still maintain the same resolution. By utilizing the ΣΔ modulator now the total number of DAC elements has decreased and therefore the delivery of the high-frequency LO signal to each DAC element is practical. One of the costs of employing ΣΔ modulator, however, is a higher quantization noise power at the output of the DAC. The quantization noise is ideally spectrally shaped to out-of-band frequencies by the ΣΔ modulator. The shaped noise which usually has comparatively high power must be filtered out to fulfill the radio transmission spectral mask requirement. Semi-digital FIR filter can be used in the context of digital-to-analog conversion, cascaded with ΣΔ modulator to filter the out-of-band noise by the modulator. In the same time it converts the signal from digital domain to an <b>analog</b> <b>quantity.</b> In general case, we can have a multi-bit, semi-digital FIR filter where each tap of the filter is realized with a sub-DAC of M bits. The delay elements are also realized with M-bit shift registers. If the output of the modulator is given by a single bit, the semi-digital FIR filter taps are simply controlled by a single switch assuming a current-steering architecture DAC. One of the major advantages is that the static linearity of the DAC is optimum. Since there are only two output levels available in the DAC, the static transfer function, regardless of the mismatch errors, is always given by a straight line. In this work, the design of SDFIR filter is done through an optimization procedure where the ΣΔ noise transfer function is also taken into account. Different constraints are defined for different applications in formulation of the SDFIR optimization problem. For a given radio transmitter application the objective function can be defined as, e. g., the hardware cost for SDFIR implementation while the constraint can be set to fulfill the radio transmitter spectral emission mask...|$|E

Accurate encoding is recovered when a homeostatic mechanism scales the excitatory synapses to each cell to compensate for the heterogeneity in cellular excitability and synaptic inputs. Moreover, the more realistic model produces a wide diversity of tuning curves, as commonly observed in recordings from prefrontal neurons. We conclude that recurrent attractor networks in conjunction with appropriate homeostatic mechanisms provide a robust, biologically plausible theoretical framework for understanding the neural circuit basis of spatial working memory...|$|R

40|$|Many neural areas, notably, the hippocampus, show structured, dynamical, {{population}} behavior such as coordinated oscillations. It {{has long}} been observed that such oscillations provide a substrate for representing analog information in the firing phases of neurons relative to the underlying population rhythm. However, {{it has become increasingly}} clear that it is essential for neural populations to represent uncertainty about the information they capture, and the substantial recent work on neural codes for uncertainty has omitted any analysis of oscillatory systems. Here, we observe that, since neurons in an oscillatory network need not only fire once in each cycle (or even at all), uncertainty about the <b>analog</b> <b>quantities</b> each neuron represents by its firing phase might naturally be reported through the degree of concentration of the spikes that it fires. We apply this theory to memory in a model of oscillatory associative recall in hippocampal area CA 3.

In these networks, the learning scheme is of much interest, with the backpropagation method being widely used. A gradient type of learning rule {{is not easy to}} realize in an electronic system, since calculation of the gradients for all weights in the network is very difficult. More suitable is the simultaneous perturbation method, since the learning rule requires only forward operations of the network to modify weights unlike the backpropagation method. In addition, pulse density NN systems have some promising properties, as they are robust to noisy situations and can handle <b>analog</b> <b>quantities</b> based on the digital circuits.

This paper presents the design of such a three-phase, closed-loop voltage controller, implementing a deadbeat controller on the output voltage and the inductor current. A digital signal processor is used to implement the digital closed-loop control algorithms. This, together with delays introduced by sampling the <b>analog</b> <b>quantities,</b> introduces a delay in the control law that causes system instability. The system model is augmented to compensate for these dynamics, hereby including a third deadbeat controlled variable. System stability is then ensured. Load current feed-forward is used to compensate {{for changes in the}} load current before the output voltages get distorted, in order to improve the output voltage waveform quality. Practical results show that the designed voltage controller can produce output voltage waveforms that can meet the specifications for balanced and unbalanced loads. This is verified by using a three-phase, four-wire, 250 kW inverter, which shows that the constructed pulse-width modulated control scheme can achieve fast dynamic response as well as low total harmonic distortion. Non-linear loads, however, produce undesirable harmonics that cause large distortion in output voltage. Conference Pape...|$|R
40|$|Perception {{involves}} {{two types}} of decisions about the sensory world: identification of stimulus features as <b>analog</b> <b>quantities,</b> or discrimination of the same stimulus features among a set of discrete alternatives. Veridical judgment and categorical discrimination have traditionally been conceptualized as two distinct computational problems. Here, we found that these {{two types of}} decision making can be subserved by a shared cortical circuit mechanism. We used a continuous recurrent network model to simulate two monkey experiments in which subjects were required to make either a two-alternative forced choice or a veridical judgment about the direction of random-dot motion. The model network is endowed with a continuum of bell-shaped population activity patterns, each representing a possible motion direction. Slow recurrent excitation underlies accumulation of sensory evidence, and its interplay with strong recurrent inhibition leads to decision behaviors. The model reproduced the monkey’s performance as well as single-neuron activity in the categorical discrimination task. Furthermore, we examined how direction identification is determined by a combination of sensory stimulation and microstimulation. Using a population-vector measure, we found that direction judgments instantiate winner-take-all (with the population vector coinciding with either the coherent motion direction or the electrically elicited motion direction) when two stimuli are far apart, or vector averaging (with the population vector falling between the two directions) when two stimuli are close to each other. Interestingly, for a broad range of intermediate angular distance...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the Sinai model describing a particle diffusing in a 1 D random force field. As shown by Golosov, this model exhibits a strong localization phenomenon for the thermal packet: the disorder {{average of the}} thermal distribution of the relative distance y=x-m(t), {{with respect to the}} (disorder-dependent) most probable position m(t), converges in the limit of infinite time towards a distribution P(y). In this paper, we revisit this question of the localization of the thermal packet. We first generalize the result of Golosov by computing explicitly the joint asymptotic distribution of relative position y=x(t) -m(t) and relative energy u=U(x(t)) -U(m(t)) for the thermal packet. Next, we compute in the infinite-time limit the localization parameters Y_k, representing the disorder-averaged probabilities that k particles of the thermal packet are at the same place, and the correlation function C(l) representing the disorder-averaged probability that two particles of the thermal packet are at a distance l from each other. We moreover prove that our results for Y_k and C(l) exactly coincide with the thermodynamic limit of the <b>analog</b> <b>quantities</b> computed for independent particles at equilibrium in a finite sample of length L. Finally, we discuss the properties of the finite-time metastable states that are responsible for the localization phenomenon and compare with the general theory of metastable states in glassy systems, in particular as a test of the Edwards conjecture.

40|$|Continuous attractor {{networks}} {{are used to}} model the storage and representation of <b>analog</b> <b>quantities,</b> such as position of a visual stimulus. The storage of multiple continuous attractors in the same network has previously been studied {{in the context of}} self-position coding. Several uncorrelated maps of environments are stored in the synaptic connections, and a position in a given environment is represented by a localized pattern of neural activity in the corresponding map, driven by a spatially tuned input. Here we analyze networks storing a pair of correlated maps, or a morph sequence between two uncorrelated maps. We find a novel state in which the network activity is simultaneously localized in both maps. In this state, a fixed cue presented to the network does not determine uniquely the location of the bump, i. e. the response is unreliable, with neurons not always responding when their preferred input is present. When the tuned input varies smoothly in time, the neuronal responses become reliable and selective for the environment: the subset of neurons responsive to a moving input in one map changes almost completely in the other map. This form of remapping is a nontrivial transformation between the tuned input to the network and the resulting tuning curves of the neurons. The new state of the network could be related to the formation of direction selectivity in one-dimensional environments and hippocampal remapping. The applicability of the model is not confined to self-position representations; we show an instance of the network solving a simple delayed discrimination task...|$|R
