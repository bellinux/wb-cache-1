5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{dreams of}} a red light that leads him to the corpse {{of a young girl}} buried in a park in Manassas, Virginia. When he awakens, he heads to the park and finds the girl's skeleton. The girl was {{determined}} to have been murdered by John Lee Roche (Tom Noonan), a serial killer who murdered thirteen girls throughout the 1980s; his modus operandi was cutting a heart out of the clothes of each victim. Mulder had captured Roche by deducing that he committed the murders while traveling as <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> salesman. Roche's hearts were never found, although he confessed to all of the murders.|$|E

He later attended Georgetown University on a scholarship, where {{he earned his}} bachelor's degree in English in 1950. Those years at Georgetown were probably {{the best years of}} my life, Blatty said in 2015. Until then, I’d never had a home. While studying for his master's degree at George Washington University, Blatty took menial jobs. Initially unable to find a job in teaching, he worked as <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> door-to-door salesman, a beer truck driver, and as a United Airlines ticket agent. He earned his master's in English literature from the George Washington University in 1954. He then enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he ultimately became head of the Policy Branch of the USAF Psychological Warfare Division.|$|E

Luigi takes a flashlight {{with him and he}} follows the map to the mansion. Upon finally arriving at his new mansion, which looks much more sinister than the supplied photo, Mario is nowhere to be found. Luigi proceeds inside the mansion, entering the Parlor after he gains the key from a strange ghost-like shape. Upon entry, he is soon assaulted by a Gold Ghost, only to be saved by a little old man wielding <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b> The old man, however, is unable to reel in the ghost and is soon overpowered. After being helped to his feet by Luigi, the old man introduces himself as Professor Elvin Gadd. The two retreat from the mansion when more of the Gold Ghosts appear.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Dyson {{had the idea}} of using {{cyclonic}} separation to create <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> that would not lose suction as it picked up dirt. He became frustrated with his Hoover Junior's diminishing performance: the dust bag kept becoming clogged with loads of dust thus reducing suction. The cyclone idea came from a sawmill that used cyclone technology (qv. History of Dyson Ltd).|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> uses {{a partial}} vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors. Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented the first vacuum cleaner in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper instead of <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> his machine did, in fact, have a {{rotating}} brush like a traditional vacuum cleaner which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism {{on top of}} the body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first vacuum cleaner on July 10, 1860. Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the first electric vacuum cleaner in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who invented the motorized vacuum cleaner in 1899. However, neither were practical or useful. The first practical and portable vacuum cleaner was built in 1907, when James Murray Spangler, a janitor from Canton, Ohio, incorporated a rotating brush, an electric fan, a box, and one of his wife's pillowcases to serve as the dust bag.|$|E
25|$|The philatelic {{literature}} has long stated that {{seven of the}} stamps have been lost or destroyed through theft or mishandling. However, in 2007 a copy came to light {{that had not been}} seen since Eugene Klein broke up the sheet, and was offered for auction that June. The number of lost stamps then became six. Several others have been damaged, including one that was sucked into <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b> Apparently Green's wife mailed one which, while recovered, is the only cancelled sample. Indeed, no Jenny invert is in pristine condition, because Klein lightly penciled a number on the back of each stamp (from 1 through 10 in the top row to 91 through 100 in the bottom row) so that its original position on the sheet could be identified. Only five examples survive, in fact, in never hinged condition. One of these is the locket copy, which, however has another condition problem: a corner crease at the bottom right probably inflicted while it was being enclosed behind glass.|$|E

Nigersaurus was dubbed a [...] "Mesozoic cow" [...] in the press, and Sereno stressed that it was the most unusual dinosaur he had ever seen.

Brian goes to tell his teacher that he cheated, but is interrupted, as the teacher tells him Brian has inspired him, and he was so depressed that he was planning to commit suicide. Meanwhile, Peter becomes very satisfied with his A-Team's actions, but the team fails a mission to save a local park from demolition by becoming [...] "side-tracked by idle conversation" [...] with the builders. The guilty A-Team disbands afterwards. Brian eventually cracks under the pressure of a final test and knowing he will only pass if he cheats, he decides to return home with Stewie.
