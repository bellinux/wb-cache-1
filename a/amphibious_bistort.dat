25|$|A {{continuous}} area {{of approximately}} 400 hectares (988 acres) {{is covered with}} woodland or plantation. The forest is managed for timber by United Utilities, using a continuous cover policy (rather than clear felling and restocking). Macclesfield Borough Council plans to increase {{the area of the}} former royal forest that is covered by woodland. The predominant species are Sitka spruce and Japanese Larch, with some Scots Pine, Lodgepole Pine, Corsican pine and Norway Spruce. There are also areas of semi-natural mixed and broadleaved woodland, mainly oak, sycamore and beech; in 2004, broadleaved species made up 23% of the total, although current forestry management aims to increase the proportion. The woodland supports mosses and thirty species of fungi, including fly agaric, stinkhorns, honey fungus and the sickener. The area also includes areas of acidic unimproved upland grassland, including approximately a hectare within the Trentabank nature reserve; this supports species including bluebell, tormentil, pignut, birdsfoot trefoil, foxglove and lesser knapweed, while the reservoir margins support aquatic plants including <b>amphibious</b> <b>bistort,</b> water mint, Water Horsetail and common spikerush.|$|E

50|$|The pits are colonised by a rich flora. In the {{southern}} site grassland plants include southern marsh-orchid, bee orchid, common fleabane, field scabious and parasitic knapweed broomrape. Marshland plants include tufted forget-me-not, water mint, pink water-speedwell, common spike-rush, <b>amphibious</b> <b>bistort</b> and the rare greater tussock-sedge.|$|E
50|$|The meadow is {{unimproved}} damp grassland on {{the bank}} of the River Colne, with plants such as purple loosestrife and <b>amphibious</b> <b>bistort.</b> In drier areas there are great willowherb, creeping thistle and stinging nettles. There are many species of butterflies and spiders, and birds include warblers.|$|E
50|$|Most common {{phytoplankton}} {{species are}} filamentous cyanobacteria and diatoms, while zooplankton {{are represented by}} daphnia and copepods. Common aquatic plants {{in the water column}} include rigid hornwort and yellow water-lily coupled with a presence of Nuttall's waterweed, frogbit, common duckweed, white waterlily, <b>amphibious</b> <b>bistort,</b> and four species of pondweeds.|$|E
50|$|The woods have tall oaks above a {{layer of}} sweet chestnut, rowan and birch, {{and there are several}} areas of grassland. Plants include wood anemone, {{bluebell}} and greater stitchwort and in at the southern end there is a small pond with <b>amphibious</b> <b>bistort</b> and brooklime. In the north there is acid grassland.|$|E
5000|$|Persicaria {{amphibia}} (syn. Polygonum amphibium) is {{a species}} of flowering plant in the knotweed family known by several common names, including longroot smartweed, water knotweed, water smartweed, and <b>amphibious</b> <b>bistort.</b> It is native to much of North America, Asia, Europe, and parts of Africa, and it is known elsewhere as an introduced species and sometimes a noxious weed.|$|E
50|$|Many {{varieties}} {{of plant and}} tree life {{can be found in}} and around the shores of the lakes and the water channels. Plants such as Angelica, great willowherb, <b>amphibious</b> <b>bistort,</b> betony, gipsywort and yellow flag iris are all common to the area. Many water loving willow trees can be seen around the lakes, these are managed to promote new growth and more willow trees.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} aquatic plants is {{relatively}} small, with the lake floor dominated by rigid hornwort, and free-floating plants including Lemna minor, yellow water-lily, white waterlily, broad-leaved pondweed, and <b>amphibious</b> <b>bistort.</b> Along the shores are Alisma, slender tufted-sedge, cyperus-like sedge, reed sweet-grass, yellow iris, purple loosestrife, Phragmites, Rorippa amphibia, and many others. Common trees found {{around the lake}} include black alder and grey sallow.|$|E
50|$|The pool {{provides}} a scarce habitat in Cornwall with rare species of algae, bryophytes and flowering plants. Aquatic plants include <b>amphibious</b> <b>bistort</b> (Persicaria amphibia), horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris), perfoliate pondweed (Potamogeton perfoliatus), shore-weed (Littorella uniflora) and six-stamened waterwort (Elatine hexandra). In 1898 a stonewort (Nitella hyalina) was first discovered in Britain at Penrose Creek by Canon G R Bullock-Webster. The last record was in 1914.|$|E
50|$|The {{aquatic flora}} {{composed}} of reed, common club-rush, flowering rush, yellow iris, greater water-parsnip, brooklime, bulbous rush, toad rush, eight-stamened waterwort, needle spike-rush, spring quillwort, <b>amphibious</b> <b>bistort,</b> pale persicaria, rigid hornwort, horned pondweed, perfoliate pondweed, blunt-leaved pondweed, grass-wrack pondweed, fennel pondweed, various-leaved pondweed, lesser pondweed, fan-leaved water-goosefoot, whorled water-milfoil, alternate water-milfoil, spiked water-milfoil, Canadian waterweed, Nuttall's waterweed, and common duckweed. There are stoneworts such as Chara delicatula and Nitella flexilis.|$|E
50|$|Aquatic plants {{includes}} reed, club-rush, wood club-rush, broadleaf cattail, flowering rush, water hemlock, yellow iris, yellow loosestrife, bittersweet, yellow water-lily, white water-lily, broad-leaved pondweed, red pondweed, whorled water-milfoil, <b>amphibious</b> <b>bistort,</b> water-soldier, frogbit, duckweed, greater bladderwort, {{and greater}} duckweed. Along {{the shores of}} the lake are hybrid crack willow, alder, bay willow, grey willow, aspen, ash, purple-loosestrife, marsh fern, wild angelica, marsh woundwort, gypsywort, creeping spearwort, marsh cinquefoil, marsh-marigold, bittersweet, skullcap, corn mint, meadowsweet, trifid bur-marigold, and purple small-reed.|$|E
50|$|The {{north shore}} is mainly vegetated with scrub and woodland, {{including}} willow, blackthorn, elder, birch, hawthorn, and hazel. Common spotted orchids {{grow in the}} base-rich flushed areas. At the extreme south eastern corner of the site there {{is an area of}} marshy grassland with abundant meadow-sweet, wild angelica, common knapweed, and sneezewort and where there is periodic flooding of the shore you can also find species like common spike rush, reed canary grass, lesser spearwort, and <b>amphibious</b> <b>bistort.</b>|$|E
50|$|In late summer, {{phytoplankton}} {{stock is}} dominated by green algae paired equal levels of diatoms, cyanobacteria, and a species of eutroph carapace flagellate (Ceratium hirundinella). Several of the blue green algae present in the lake are potentially poisonous and, notwithstanding non-alarming levels, therefore carefully monitored near the bathe. Lacking soft and shallow bottom areas near the shore, the lake contains only commonplace vegetation, save for the population of crack willow and the hybrid between white willow and bay willow found on the southern shore. Aquatic plants are dominated by white waterlily, <b>amphibious</b> <b>bistort,</b> and occasional curled pondweed (uncommon to Stockholm).|$|E

40|$|A host {{race is a}} {{population}} which is partially reproductively isolated as {{a direct consequence of}} adaptation to a certain host. For host race formation to occur five conditions should be met. First of all, the populations should occur in sympatry, which means that they co-occur within the normal cruising range of the herbivore species. The second condition is that individuals with a different phenotype use different resources. Thirdly, some degree of host preference should be shown. The fourth condition is that fitness consequences are associated with the host preference. Finally, positive assortative mating is the fifth condition for host race formation. The main question addressed in this thesis is whether sympatric speciation via host race formation occurs in nature. This question was addressed by testing these five conditions in part of the Galerucella nymphaeae-complex, the water lily leaf beetle, living on Yellow and White waterlily (Nuphar lutea and Nymphaea alba, both Nymphaeaceae) and <b>Amphibious</b> <b>bistort</b> and Great waterdock (Polygonum ampbibium and Rumex hydrolapathum, both Polygonaceae). Furthermore, it was investigated whether morphological and ecological differences have led to reduced gene flow between sympatric populations living on different hosts. Finally, the taxonomic status of the host-associated populations was examined, using molecular DNA techniques. All five conditions for host race formation are met in G. nymphaeae. Furthermore, RAPD analysis revealed that gene flow is indeed limited between sympatric beetle populations living on Nymphaeaceae and Polygonaceae. Breeding experiments and ITS- 1 sequence data show that all beetles studied belong to one biological species. Thus, G. nymphaeae provides an excellent example of host race formation in nature, in which all conditions were tested and met. Hence, host race formation, and eventually sympatric species, is possible in nature, even when none of the hosts is recently introduce...|$|E
