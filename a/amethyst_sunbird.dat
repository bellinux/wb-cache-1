50|$|The <b>amethyst</b> <b>sunbird,</b> {{also called}} the black sunbird (Chalcomitra amethystina), is a species of {{passerine}} bird in the Nectariniidae family. It is native to the Afrotropics, mostly south of the equator. They are commonly found in well-watered habitats, and undertake seasonal movements to visit flowering woodlands. The demise of some woodlands have impacted their numbers locally, but their range has also expanded along with the spread of wooded gardens.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) - University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2007. Southern Africa is characterised by an {{unpredictable}} environment with daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations. As a local or non-migratory endothermic species occurring over an altitudinal gradient from the Drakensberg {{to the coast}} of KwaZulu- Natal in southern Africa, Amethyst Sunbirds (Chalcomitra amethystina) experience challenging thermal conditions and increased energetic stress {{as a result of}} ambient temperature variation. Flexibility of metabolic rates within a species allows for the colonization of different habitats along an altitudinal and thus temperature gradient. It was predicted that over this altitudinal gradient Amethyst Sunbirds would exhibit variation in metabolic rates, particularly basal metabolic rates, pre- and postacclimation, as well as variation in hematocrit levels in winter and summer trials. It was also predicted that Amethyst Sunbirds would exhibit seasonal variation in metabolic parameters. Sunbirds were caught in a winter and summer season (2006 - 2007) using mist nets in three locations; Underberg (1553 m), Howick (1075 m) and Oribi Gorge (541 m). Upon capture, metabolic rate was measured indirectly by quantifying oxygen consumption (VO 2) using flow through respirometry, at 5 and 25 °C. Birds were then acclimated at 25 °C for 6 weeks on a 12 L: 12 D cycle. VO 2 was measured postacclimation at 8 different temperatures (15, 5, 10, 20, 30, 28, 25 and 33 °C). Hematocrit levels were taken pre-acclimation and pre-release. Winter and summer data were compared. In the winter trials it was found that there was little variation in VO 2 between individuals from the same locality, whereas significant variation was observed at the same temperatures between localities and thus between altitudes. The subpopulation from the highest altitudinal site had the highest basal metabolic rate (BMR). Summer trials showed that metabolic rates did not differ significantly between altitudinal subpopulations of Amethyst Sunbirds, however, BMR was observed to decrease as altitude decreased. The comparison of seasonal data showed that <b>Amethyst</b> <b>Sunbird</b> subpopulations from Underberg and Howick showed higher post-acclimation VO 2 values per temperature in winter than in summer trials. Post-acclimation resting metabolic rate (RMR) values for Howick subpopulations were generally higher in winter than in summer, Underberg Amethyst Sunbirds showed a significant difference between summer and winter RMR at 5 and 10 °C and Howick sunbirds showed a significant difference in RMR between seasons at 5 °C. The Oribi Gorge subpopulation, however, showed no significant differences in metabolic rate between any temperatures when comparing a summer and a winter season. Thermal neutral zones of all of the subpopulations of Amethyst Sunbirds shifted between the winter and summer trial period. This study thus emphasized the need to understand plasticity in metabolic rates and acknowledge altitudinal and seasonal differences within a species, in order to make accurate predictions about a species thermal physiology and responses to changes in ambient temperatures. In particular, the variation in BMR, which is usually used as a species specific value, should be acknowledged in comparative studies of avian metabolic rates or in climate change models.

40|$|AbstractMost of {{the species}} in the large African genus Kniphofia have floral traits that conform to the bird {{pollination}} syndrome, however there has been very little empirical work to confirm that birds are effective pollinators of Kniphofia species. From selective exclusion experiments, behavioural observations and pollen load analyses, we identified <b>Amethyst</b> <b>Sunbirds</b> (Chalcomitra amethystina) and Malachite Sunbirds (Nectarinia famosa) as the primary pollinators in two populations of Kniphofia laxiflora, with bees playing a smaller role. Bird visitors obtain moderate volumes (∼ 9 µl) of relatively concentrated (∼ 15 %) hexose-rich nectar in the flowers. This species is shown to be genetically self-incompatible, and thus reliant on pollinator visits for seed set. Although mountain pride butterflies (Aeropetes tulbaghia) {{have been identified as}} important pollinators of this species at two other populations, they did not occur at the two populations we studied...|$|R
40|$|The {{small size}} of {{nectarivorous}} birds is associated with high mass-specific metabolic rates and energetic lifestyles. Their energy balance {{is likely to be}} strongly influenced by environmental factors. Firstly, nectar varies in sugar concentration between different food plants and birds must adjust their consumption to maintain a constant energy intake. Secondly, unfavourable weather conditions, such as storms and heavy rains, may prevent birds from feeding, and they must increase their energy intake to compensate for the loss in foraging time. Low ambient temperature, as a third energetic challenge, results in higher energy demands for thermoregulation, which leads to increased food intake. However, these compensatory feeding responses may be constrained by physiological limitations to nectar ingestion, digestion and osmoregulatory processes. My research focused on the behavioural and physiological responses of captive sunbirds (Nectariniidae) and honeyeaters (Meliphagidae) to energetic challenges, namely variations in nectar quality and availability and in ambient temperature. For sunbirds, I also investigated on a novel short-term scale how feeding patterns are adjusted in order to compensate for alterations in energy intake or requirements. Feeding events were recorded using a photodetection system, and body mass was monitored continuously by connecting the perches to electronic balances, interfaced to a computer. Whitebellied sunbirds (Cinnyris talatala) were fed various nectar sugar concentrations. Their feeding durations were found to provide an estimate of meal size on all food concentrations. When exposed to a decrease in sugar concentration, birds generally demonstrated an increased feeding frequency and food intake within 10 min. The number and duration of meals increased in the first few minutes after return of a more concentrated diet. When whitebellied sunbirds and brown honeyeaters (Lichmera indistincta) were exposed to a 2 h fasting period during the day, they increased their nectar intake and energy accumulation after the fast. Sunbirds achieved this by increasing meal size but not meal frequency. However, both species weighed less in the evening following the fast than the previous evening, indicating that the compensation for lost foraging time was incomplete. During acute cold exposure, whitebellied <b>sunbirds,</b> <b>amethyst</b> <b>sunbirds</b> (Chalcomitra amethystina) and brown honeyeaters increased their nectar intake, but lost body mass irrespective of nectar sugar concentration. Honeyeaters ingested more food at subsequent cold exposure, suggesting physiological adaptation to high feeding rates. A chemical reactor model of digestive capacity, which assumes sucrose hydrolysis to be the limiting step in nectar digestion, accurately predicted maximal food intake in honeyeaters, but mostly underestimated it in sunbirds. Sugar assimilation efficiency was higher than 99 % in whitebellied sunbirds and brown honeyeaters. Lastly, licking frequencies and tongue loads of whitebellied and <b>amethyst</b> <b>sunbirds</b> were investigated. In both species, tongue lick duration increased, and licking frequency and consumption per lick decreased, with increasing nectar concentration. Birds did not adjust their licking behaviour after a fasting period. In conclusion, the response to varied energy challenges is shaped by both compensatory feeding and physiological constraints. Although unrelated, sunbirds and honeyeaters showed convergence in their responses, probably due to their similar nectarfeeding lifestyle. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|Nectar {{concentration}} and composition varies widely between plant species. Nectarivorous birds that associate floral characteristics with nectar quality {{may be able}} to avoid less rewarding flowers and therefore forage more efficiently. We assessed the abilities of <b>amethyst</b> <b>sunbirds</b> (Chalcomitra amethystina) to utilize color cues to discriminate between concentrated (1 M) and dilute (0. 25 M) sucrose solutions. In an outdoor aviary, birds were presented with three rich feeders among six poor feeders on a feeding board. Following the assessment of baseline performance with optically identical feeders, color cues were added to the feeders for a 6 h training period. To assess the retention of learnt visual cues, birds were tested 1 and 7 days following the training. Observations lasted for 3 h, with feeders being re-arranged every 30 min to minimize spatial learning. In the absence of color cues, birds selected feeders randomly, but when color cues were available visited more rich than poor feeders. This more rapid identification of rich feeders resulted in a decrease in feeding duration and feeding frequency, compared to the baseline performance. Energy uptake from rich feeders, and therefore the rate of energy gain, increased when birds foraged with color cues. No differences were found between days 1 and 7 after training. Total energy intake decreased with visual cues, which may indicate a reduction in foraging costs when cues allow for location of rewarding feeders. Our findings demonstrate that sunbirds forage more efficiently with cues, which may lead to increased fitness.
