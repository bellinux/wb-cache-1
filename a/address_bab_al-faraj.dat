The gate was built as part of a large program to re-fortify the city {{following}} its capture by Nur ad-Din Zangi in 1154. The twin gate crosses a bridge over a section of the Barada river that runs along the northern city walls of Damascus. The gate is notable for being the only surviving gate in the city that was built completely after the Muslim conquest of Damascus.|$|R
25|$|The {{houses and}} other {{properties}} of the Jewish families which were not sold after the migration, remain uninhabited {{under the protection of}} the Syrian Government. Most of these properties are in Al-Jamiliyah and <b>Bab</b> <b>Al-Faraj</b> areas, and the neighbourhoods around the Central Synagogue of Aleppo. In 1992, the Syrian government lifted the travel ban on its 4,500 Jewish citizens. Most traveled to the United States, where a sizable number of Syrian Jews currently live in Brooklyn, New York. The last Jews of Aleppo, the Halabi family, were evacuated from the city in October 2016 by the Free Syrian Army and now live in Israel.|$|R
50|$|In 1904 it {{was torn}} {{down with a}} portion of the {{surrounding}} fabric to become a public square known by the same name. Nowadays, it is a major junction of the traffic flow {{in and out of the}} old city to the extramural areas. The <b>Bab</b> <b>al-Faraj</b> reconstruction project is one of the first preservation efforts in Aleppo. It started in 1978 and is still underway. The remains of the original gate were recently uncovered and are several meters under street level. The gate will be the focus in an archaeological park that is part of the modern civic programs in the leveled area.|$|R
50|$|The gate, {{located in}} the {{northern}} walls near {{the northeast corner of}} the citadel, was built by Nur ad-Din Zangi in 1154-55. Al-Malik al-Salih fortified the gate further in 1239-40 and added another gateway {{to the north of the}} original gate. <b>Bab</b> <b>al-Faraj</b> was rebuilt again in 1396-97 under the Mamluks. The gate was further renovated and restored in the 1980s. The two separate gateways are connected by a narrow steel-roofed alley that serves nowadays as a souq for small hardware and keys. The northern gateway opens up to the modern street of al-Malik Faisal, and still serves as the main northwestern entrance to the old city.|$|R

2500|$|As {{an ancient}} trading centre, Aleppo's {{impressive}} souqs, khans, hammams, madrasas, mosques and churches {{are all in}} need of more care and preservation work. After World War II, the city was significantly redesigned; in 1954 French architect André Gutton {{had a number of}} wide new roads cut through the city to allow easier passage for modern traffic. Between 1954 and 1983 many buildings in the old city were demolished to allow for the construction of modern apartment blocks, particularly in the northwestern areas (<b>Bab</b> <b>al-Faraj</b> and <b>Bab</b> al-Jinan). As awareness for the need to preserve this unique cultural heritage increased, Gutton's master plan was finally abandoned in 1979 to be replaced with a new plan presented by the Swiss expert and urban designer Stefano Bianca, which adopted the idea of [...] "preserving the traditional architectural style of Ancient Aleppo" [...] paving the way for UNESCO to declare the Old City of Aleppo as a World Heritage Site in 1986.|$|R
25|$|The {{city was}} home to a {{significant}} Jewish population from ancient times. The Great Synagogue, built in the 5th century, housed the Aleppo Codex. The Jews of Aleppo were known for their religious commitment, Rabbinic leadership, and their liturgy, consisting of Pizmonim and Baqashot. After the Spanish Inquisition, the city of Aleppo received many Sephardic Jewish immigrants, who eventually joined with the native Aleppo Jewish community. Peaceful relations existed between the Jews and surrounding population. In the early 20th-century, the town's Jews lived mainly in Al-Jamiliyah, <b>Bab</b> <b>Al-Faraj</b> and the neighbourhoods around the Great Synagogue. Unrest in Palestine in the years preceding the establishment of Israel in 1948 resulted in growing hostility towards Jews living in Arab countries, culminating in the Jewish exodus from Arab lands. In December 1947, after the UN decided the partition of Palestine, an Arab mob attacked the Jewish quarter. Homes, schools and shops were badly damaged. Soon after, many of the town's remaining 6,000 Jews emigrated. In 1968, there were an estimated 700 Jews still remaining in Aleppo.|$|R

2500|$|Mullá Husayn {{stayed in}} Maku with the Báb for nine days, during which {{accounts}} {{report that the}} two cherished each other's company in the relative peace of imprisonment in a remote province. Mullá Husayn slept in the Báb's quarters and received pilgrims alongside the Báb during the days. Eventually the Báb ordered Mullá Husayn to depart for Mazandaran Province, reportedly offering parting instructions to Mullá Husayn and Qambar-Ali. In his parting <b>address</b> the <b>Báb</b> praised Qambar-Ali, comparing him to the groom of the Imam Ali, and lauded Mullá Husayn's courage courage and heroism; Nabil reports that the Báb promised Mullá Husayn that in Mazandaran [...] "God's hidden treasure" [...] would be revealed to him and Mullá Husayn's most important task would become clear. Mullá Husayn and Qambar-Ali left Maku carrying copies of significant works of the Báb which had been written during his stay in Maku, which they shared with Bábís during their journey to Mazandaran.|$|R
2500|$|After his {{recognition}} of the Báb, Mullá Husayn was appointed as {{the first member of}} the Letters of the Living. The Báb forbade Mullá Husayn from actively spreading his newfound religion, and instead explained that seventeen others would have to independently recognize him as the Mahdi before he would allow the Bábi Religion to be openly spread. During his time in Shiraz, Mullá Husayn took up a teaching position in the Vakil mosque, where he gathered a large number of student which included notable clerics in Shiraz. During his lectures in Shiraz he never directly referenced the Báb, but his regular meetings with the Báb inspired the content of his lectures. Within five months, seventeen other disciples of Siyyid Kázim had recognized the Báb as sent by God and joined Mullá Husayn among the ranks of the Letters of the Living. Among these first to convert to Bábism were Mullá Husayn's companions on his journey from Karbala to Shiraz: Muḥammad-Ḥasan Bushrú'í, Muḥammad-Báqir Bushrú'í and Mullá `Alí Basṭámí. The <b>Báb</b> <b>addressed</b> an epistle to each of the Letters of the Living and tasked them with spreading his religion throughout the country and surrounding regions.|$|R
