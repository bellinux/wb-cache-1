5000|$|A retired Lieutenant-Colonel of the Royal Tank regiment, Peter Miller (1912 - 2006) {{conceived}} {{the idea in}} the aftermath of a period (1971 - 72) when the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC) lost eight ATOs (<b>Ammunition</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Officers)</b> on active duty in Northern Ireland: an appalling rate of attrition due to the limited options available to an operator faced with an IED. Tasked with finding a solution by Colonel George Styles, Miller [...] "remembered that he had invented a delightful labour-saving technique when he modified my lawnmower. This seemed a possible solution to the problem, so he went to a local garden centre with the intention of buying a gutted lawnmower. The sales manager suggested that the chassis of an electrically powered wheelbarrow might be suitable. He thought it was ideal and bought one on the spot." ...|$|R
40|$|When {{the army}} {{deployed}} to Northern Ireland in 1969 it was {{unprepared for the}} intensive bombing campaign that was to follow. Improvised Explosive Device Disposal (IEDD) was conducted {{in much the same}} way as it had been since the 19 th century – manually, with one or two men pitting themselves against the device, or its creator. The painful experience of the ‘Troubles’ in Northern Ireland - and in particular the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) bombing campaign - led to the development of the contemporary British approach to IEDD. The army dealt with over 56000 Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) incidents by 2007, rendering safe over 6300 IEDs. These successes came at a heavy price. 17 <b>Ammunition</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Officers</b> (ATOs) and three other EOD team members were killed in Northern Ireland. Most of these deaths occurred during the early 1970 s. It must be asked why the IEDD was more dangerous then and why did it become apparently safer in later years, despite the terrorists’ growing prowess? This thesis argues that EOD changed in the 1970 s as a result of the lessons learned when casualties occurred, and that the most important changes were conceptual. Safety and success for the EOD teams came not from out-braving the bombs, but from outthinking the bombers. The lessons learnt were distilled and formalised into a set of principles, philosophies and rules that guided the conduct of IEDD operations. This thesis explains how the EOD experience in Northern Ireland shaped the contemporary British approach to IEDD operations. It begins with an introduction and a historical background. The methodology used is discussed, and the available literature on the subject is reviewed. An overview of the development of IEDs and IED tactics is offered, and the state of IEDD at the start of the Northern Ireland campaign is examined. Each of the incidents resulting in an EOD fatality is discussed and analysed in a case study, and this is followed by a further selection of case studies that scrutinise non fatal incidents that had an influence on the conduct of operations. A chapter is devoted to an analysis of successful attacks on EOD teams and from this a number of theories are offered. The official responses to incidents, in the form of regulatory documents and training publications are then discussed before the roles of equipment and personnel selection are considered...|$|R

5000|$|St. Jamess Palace, London S.W.I,11h January 1972.The QUEEN {{has been}} graciously pleased {{to approve the}} award of the George Cross to the undermentioned:Major Stephen George STYLES (383996) Royal Army Ordnance Corps.As Senior <b>Ammunition</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Officer,</b> Northern Ireland, Major Styles was {{responsible}} for the supervision of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps deployed to deal with the ever-increasing number of explosive devices used in the terrorist campaign.On 20 October 1971, Major Styles was called to assist with a device of an apparently new design placed in a public telephone kiosk in Belfasts comparatively new, and largest, hotel, the Europa. Major Styles immediately went to the scene and, having ensured that the military and police had secured the area and evacuation of personnel had also been effected, took charge of the operation of neutralising, removing and dismantling the bomb.Investigation revealed that the bomb was of a new and complicated construction with anti-handling devices to defeat attempts to disarm it. Until the electrical circuit had been neutralised, the slightest movement could have set it off. The device contained between 10 and 15 Ibs of explosive and could have caused instant death as well as extensive damage. No-one was more aware of the destructive capability of the bomb than Major Styles, yet he placed himself at great personal risk to minimise the danger to his team, to confirm the success of each stage of the operation, and to ensure the practicability of the next stage. The whole operation took seven hours to plan and execute and was completely successful.Two days later he was again called to the same hotel where a second bomb had been laid by armed terrorists. This bomb was found to be an even larger device with a charge of over 30 Ibs of explosive, anti-handling devices, and a confusion of electrical circuits; it was clearly intended to defeat disarming techniques and to kill the operator trying to neutralise it. Major Styles again immediately took charge of the situation and successfully disarmed, removed and dismantled the bomb, this time after 9 hours intense and dangerous work.As a result of his courageous and dedicated resolution, two determined and ingenious attempts by terrorists against life and property were defeated, and technical information was obtained which will help to save the lives of operators faced with such devices in future.Throughout each operation Major Styles displayed a calm resolution in control, a degree of technical skill and personal bravery in circumstances of extreme danger far beyond that of the call of duty. His work was an outstanding inspiration and example, particularly to others engaged in this dangerous type of work.|$|E
