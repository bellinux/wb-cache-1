They are based upon the <b>absolute</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> and the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS- 68). Reference tables for several thermoelements versus platinum (Pt- 67) are given with values of the thermoelectric voltage as a function of temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

40|$|The {{question}} of radiation scales is critically examined. There are two radiation scales which are of fundamental validity {{and there are}} several calibration standards and radiation scales which have been set up for practical convenience. The interrelation between these scales is investigated. It is shown that within the limits of accuracy of irradiance measurements in general and solar irradiance measurements in particular, the proposed standard values of the solar constant and solar spectrum should be considered to be on radiation scales of fundamental validity; those based on <b>absolute</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> and on the thermodynamic Kelvin temperature scale...|$|R
500|$|In 1921 the Treaty of the Metre was {{extended}} to cover <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> with the CGPM merging its work {{with that of the}} IEC. At the 8th CGPM in 1933 the need to replace the [...] "International" [...] <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> with [...] "absolute" [...] units was raised. The IEC proposal that Giorgi's proposal be adopted was accepted, but no decision was made as to which <b>electrical</b> <b>unit</b> should be the fourth base unit. In 1935 Sears proposed that this should be the ampere, but World War II prevented this being formalised until 1946. The definitions for <b>absolute</b> <b>electrical</b> system based on the ampere was formalized in 1948.|$|R
5000|$|The only {{significant}} international {{use of the}} meridional definition of the metre, apart from Méchain and Delambre's original survey, was the initial work conducted by the British Association for the Advancement of Science (B.A.) on <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> which was {{to lead to the}} International System of <b>Electrical</b> and Magnetic <b>Units.</b> It was often claimed that the international <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> formed a coherent set of absolute units in the quadrant-eleventh-gram-second system (aka [...] "QES system" [...] or [...] "Q.E.S. system"), where the unit length was the quadrant of the Earth's polar circumference, the unit mass was the [...] "eleventh-gram" [...] or 10−11 grams and the unit time was the second. Nevertheless, the precision of <b>absolute</b> <b>electrical</b> measurements {{in the late nineteenth century}} was not such that the 0.02% difference in the definitions of the metre had any practical significance.|$|R

Since 1954 the CIPM committee that oversees the definition of units of measurement, the Consultative Committee for Units, has representatives from many international organisations including the ISR, IEC and ISO under the chairmanship of the CIPM.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conventional}} <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> are [...] "quasi-natural" [...] in {{the sense}} that they are completely and exactly defined in terms of fundamental physical constants. They are the first set of measurement units to be defined in this way, and as such, represent a significant step towards using [...] "natural" [...] fundamental physics for practical measurement purposes. However, the conventional <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> are unlike other systems of natural units in that some physical constants are not set to unity but rather set to fixed numerical values that are very close (but not precisely the same) to those in the common SI system of units.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1875, the Treaty of the Metre passed {{responsibility}} for verification of the kilogram and metre against agreed prototypes from French to international control. In 1921, the Treaty {{was extended to}} include all physical quantities including <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> originally defined in 1893.|$|R
50|$|Tonne of oil {{equivalent}} {{should be used}} carefully when converting <b>electrical</b> <b>units.</b> For instance, BP's 2007 report used a factor of 38% efficiency (the average efficiency of OECD thermal generating units in 2006), or roughly 16 GJ per toe, when converting kilowatt-hours to toe.|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the numerical}} {{value of the}} Planck constant depends on the system of units used to describe it. Its value in SI units is known to 12 parts per billion but its value in atomic units is known exactly, {{because of the way}} the scale of atomic units is defined. The same is true of conventional <b>electrical</b> <b>units,</b> where the Planck constant (denoted h90 to distinguish it from its value in SI units) is given bywith KJ-90 and RK-90 being exactly defined constants. Atomic <b>units</b> and conventional <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> are very useful in their respective fields, because the uncertainty in the final result does not depend on an uncertain conversion factor, only on the uncertainty of the measurement itself.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{integration}} into Simulink {{has the advantage}} that only {{the part of the}} system in which <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> are of interest needs to be modeled as an electrical circuit.

2500|$|In 1861, during {{discussions about}} standardising <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> of measure, Charles Bright and Latimer Clark {{proposed}} the units of measure be named, not {{in relation to}} what they are used for, or common objects, but after eminent scientists; with the <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> of resistance, potential difference and capacitance being named the ohm, volt and farad in honour of Georg Ohm, Alessandro Volta and Michael Faraday respectively. [...] This proposal {{had the support of}} William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who had been instrumental in forming the Committee of Electrical Standards of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The use of scientists' names for the naming of units of measure was subsequently extended for other units including the watt named after James Watt and the degree Celsius named after Anders Celsius.|$|R
50|$|In 1901 Giorgi {{published}} {{a proposal for}} building a coherent set of units based on four base units - the metre, kilogram, second and one <b>electrical</b> <b>unit</b> (ampere, volt or ohm). In 1921 the Convention was extended to permit the promotion of standards relating to any physical quantity which greatly increased {{the scope of the}} CIPM's remit and implicitly giving it freedom to exploit Giorgi's proposals. The 8th CGPM (1933) resolved to work with other international bodies to agree standards for <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> that could be related back to the international prototypes. This was agreed in principle by the International Electrotechnical Commission at its congress in Brussels in 1935 subject to the choice of the fourth unit being agreed with, amongst others, the appropriate consultative committee of the CIPM.|$|R
5|$|In 1861 a {{committee}} of the British Association for Advancement of Science (BAAS) including William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), James Clerk Maxwell and James Prescott Joule introduced {{the concept of a}} coherent system of units based on the metre, gram and second, which, in 1873, was extended to include <b>electrical</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R

Among the more important, published in 1907-1908, are those on 'A New Current Weigher' (in conjunction with the late Prof Ayrton and Prof Mather); and on the 'Silver Voltameter' (with Profs Mather and Lowry). Papers on 'Mercury Standards of Resistance,' and on 'The Changes of Standards of Resistance,' appeared in 1909. Since that time Mr Smith has been occupied with the 'Determination of the Absolute Unit of Resistance,' and a most important paper giving the results of this enquiry has just been communicated to the Royal Society. He has also recently edited the Collected Volume of Reports of the BA Electrical Standards Committee. In 1908 he gave valuable assistance in connection with the International Congress on <b>Electrical</b> <b>Units,</b> and as a member of Lord Rayleigh's Committee appointed by the Congress, has since assisted in international work at Washington. In a paper recently published by the Bureau of Standards it is stated that his work in 1907 'marks {{the beginning of a new}} epoch in the history of the <b>absolute</b> measurement of <b>electrical</b> quantities.'
