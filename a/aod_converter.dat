40|$|Metal {{hydroxide}} sludge is a metallurgical residue from neutralisation of spent pickling baths in {{stainless steel}} plants. Metal hydroxide sludge mainly contains metal hydroxides, calcium, fluoride {{and water and}} has up until now been deposited in landfills in Sweden. This thesis shows that hydroxide sludge is fully possible to recycle back into the <b>AOD</b> <b>converter</b> during slag reduction stage. Its calcium fluoride contents are utilized as flux. Prior to reintroduction, the hydroxide sludge is dried and calcined to drive off all water, included chemically bonded water. Calcined metal hydroxide sludge is called hydroflux. Metal content in hydroflux is present as metal oxides. In a bench-scale <b>AOD</b> <b>converter</b> seven successful reduction tests, with three different varieties of hydrofluxes, type A, B and C were performed. The reduction tests are conducted with same basicity and CaO/CaF 2 ratio as a full scale <b>AOD</b> <b>converter.</b> Chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction analysis show that near identical final slag chemistry is achieved as planned. Some differences in metal retrieval, depending on hydroflux type used, are noticed. Briquetting as agglomeration method is performed on one hydroflux. Three types of strength tests are performed on the hydrofluxes and results are compared to toughness of mineral fluorspar. Theoretical calculation results show how final slag as well as additives will increase with use of hydroflux as calcium fluoride provider in the <b>AOD</b> <b>converter</b> during reduction procedure. The pros and cons for every hydroflux are weighed against each other and one type of hydroflux is recommended for further full-scale usage. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|The Argon Oxygen Decarburization (AOD) {{process is}} one of the major {{stainless}} steel refining routes. Several parameters come into play deciding the outcome of the process. The task focuses on studying an optimized processing in an <b>AOD</b> <b>converter</b> using the UHT’s Converter Automation System (UTCAS) -process control program. The process parameters that mostly influence the process are studied and their effect on the process are analyzed. The 304, 409, 316, 430, 201, 2205 stainless steel grades are chosen for this study. The input temperature, input element content (carbon, chromium, nickel, silica, molybdenum and manganese), input steel mass are varied individually keeping all the other parameters constant and their effect on the process is analyzed. The parameters like process time, amount of gases (O 2, N 2 and Ar) consumed, amount of reducing agent (FeSi) and amount of alloy addition are taken into consideration to decide the optimal outcome of the process. The number of gas blowing steps is also varied to study its influence on the AOD process. This is done at different process initial input to also study the effect varying parameters on the stainless steel process. After analyzing the effect of all the parameters suggestible range of values for the parameters are proposed for on optimal blowing in an <b>AOD</b> <b>converter...</b>|$|E
40|$|Melting {{steel scrap}} and alloys in an {{electric}} arc furnace (EAF) {{is the first step}} in stainless steel production. Further processing of the liquid steel is then carrying out in an Argon Oxygen Decarburisation (<b>AOD)</b> <b>converter.</b> The main objective of the treatment in the <b>AOD</b> <b>converter</b> is to reduce the carbon content to a target value by injecting an oxygen-argon mixture. During this decarburisation step unavoidably some chromium and other alloying elements with high affinity to oxygen are oxidised and ends up in the slag. To obtain an acceptable yield of these alloying elements is necessary to reduce the slag in the <b>AOD</b> <b>converter</b> after the decarburisation with either aluminium or ferrosilicon. In the case of aluminium reduction, the final slag after reduction is generally composed of lime (CaO) and aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3). The denomination of the slag is Al-reduced AOD-slag and at the moment this has no practical use and is stored as landfill. Therefore, the slag ought to be recycled due to financial and environmental reasons. Within the present work, recirculation of Al-reduced AOD-slag to the EAF as slag former has been examined by theoretical analysis and practical trial using a small rotating kiln. The main aim of the thermodynamic calculations was to investigate how much of the Al-reduced AOD-slag is needed to reduce the activity of silicate in the slag and thereby depressing the loss of chromium to the slag. The second phase of the study was designed to investigate the effect of added Al-reduced AOD slag on refractory wear during trials in a rotary kiln. During these trials the kiln was lined with four different types of bricks, supplied by the three companies participating in this project – Vargön Alloys AB, Outokumpu Stainless AB Avesta and Sandvik Materials Technology. The thermodynamic calculations disclose that a significant decrease of the activity of SiO 2 could be observed with only 5 weights per cent addition of Al-reduced AOD-slag. Furthermore, the result showed that 15 weight per cent of Al-reduced AOD-slag in the EAF slag can be recycled to the EAF without a large impact on the refractory material. Additionally, X-ray diffraction investigations of the Al-reduced AOD-slag showed that there was no metal contamination. Key words: AOD-slag, slag recycling, refractory wear, slag activities, EAF-slag. Validerat; 20151119 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
40|$|Side blown {{refining}} {{units are}} popularly {{used in the}} steel industries and include reactors such as, energy optimizing furnace, <b>AOD</b> <b>converters</b> and so on. In almost all such cases, the tuyeres have their axis orthogonal to the furnace wall and are located typically on the side walls, near {{the base of the}} reactor. Depending on requirements, either a reactive or inert gas or both in conjunction is supplied through one or more of such injectors, The present study suggests that at any given gas injection rate, orientation of side tuyeres together with their numbers can significantly influence the nature and intensity of bath agitation. Through an exploratory physical model study, it is demonstrated that by marginally re-orienting a pair of otherwise orthogonal horizontal tuyeres (i. e. entering at an angle of 10 - 15 as opposed to the conventional, perpendicular to the reactor wall), a strong swirling motion could be imparted to the bath. Such rotational motion aided by the prevalent three dimensional flow was found to increase heat and mass transfer rates in the system by 25 - 30 %...|$|R
40|$|Outokumpu Stainless Oy Tornio works {{produces}} {{in close}} future around 1. 7 million tonnes steel slabs annually. As {{all in the}} metallurgical processes the production of stainless steel is producing by-products as slags. The different kinds of processes produce about 300 000 tonnes slags annually, almost the whole amount {{of this has been}} deposited after the metal separation up to recent days. The project to utilize the steel slag started during 2001 with the aim {{to increase the amount of}} recycled by-products and to develop new slag-products. By-products are produced from the different process part as Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF 1, EAF 2), Argon Oxygen Decarburization <b>converters</b> (<b>AOD</b> 1, AOD 2), ladle stations and Chromium Converter (CRC). The chemical composition of slags from a process has a slight variation, but between the different processes the variations in analyses are greater. The chemical composition of the slags is dependent to the characters of the slag, as volume stability by basicity of the material. The aim of this work was to investigate the quality control of chromium containing steel slags during cooling into solid phase. The product should be an aggregate with sufficient hardness and low leaching behaviors. The investigation started when the slag was poured into a slag pot at melting shop, any addition of stabilizers or other chemical components has not been done. The aim was to investigate the dependence of different cooling methods to spinel forming. The physical properties of the product of the tests were tested by Nordic ball mill test (prEN 1097 - 9). The chemical analyses were: total analyses (XRF), and leaching test (Shaking test prEN 12457 - 3). A powder X-ray diffraction meter analyses (XRD) was used to estimate the mineralogy of the samples. The solid aggregate samples were studied with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Simulations with respective chemical analysis of the slags were done by the data program FactSage. The slags, included in this work, were mainly EAF 2 and CRC slags because of less variation in chemical analysis of these slags. These slags contain chromium, a minor part of chromium is not bound in spinels, which is a reason for leaching. During the first tests, which were carried out by water-cooling, no significant decreasing of leaching of chromium was observed. When pouring out the slag as a thin bed the leaching of chromium was lower compared to the massive bed of the same slag part. Lower leaching of chromium from the massive material from the thin bed can be caused by the smaller active surface of material. Reference test with semi-quenched slag were made and they showed low leaching values compared with the slags from normally pouring practices. Semi-quenched slag is porous and cannot be analyzed in SEM and was hence milled as powder and analyzed in XRD. The mineralogy of semi-quenched slag is varying in some degree from the mineralogy of normally poured slag. The semi-quenched slag, pumice, is partly amorphous which can be the reason for lower leaching values of chromium. Granulation tests have been made earlier with all of the three types of slag, but all of these showed higher leaching values than those of pumice. During granulation material may come in contact with air and become oxidized and chromium oxides leach more than other compounds of chromium. The lowest leaching values of slag can be attained by semi-quenching of material but the product is not an aggregate and cannot be used in all of the civil engineering applications. Aggregates can be produced by cooling on the slabs, but the slag bed should be maximum 10 cm thick, so that the gases can flow out before solidification of material. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|Continuous casting is {{a casting}} process that {{produces}} steel slabs {{in a continuous}} manner with steel being poured {{at the top of}} the caster and a steel strand emerging from the mould below. Molten steel is transferred from the <b>AOD</b> <b>converter</b> to the caster using a ladle. The ladle is designed to be strong and insulated. Complete insulation is never achieved. Some of the heat is lost to the refractories by convection and conduction. Heat losses by radiation also occur. It is important to know the temperature of the melt during the process. For this reason, an online model was previously developed to simulate the steel and ladle wall temperatures during the ladle cycle. The model was developed as an ODE based model using grey box modeling technique. The model’s performance was acceptable and needed to be presented in a user friendly way. The aim of this thesis work was basically to design a GUI that presents steel and ladle wall temperatures calculated by the model and also allow the user to make adjustments to the model. This thesis work also discusses the sensitivity analysis of different parameters involved and their effects on different temperature estimations...|$|E
40|$|The {{major issue}} in {{stainless}} steelmaking is the difficulty of oxidising carbon from molten steel without also oxidising large proportions of expensive chromium. This can, however, be achieved by reducing the partial pressure of the gaseous product of carbon oxidation, carbon monoxide, by dilution with argon. Modern stainless steelmaking is dominated by duplex processes which prepare a high carbon melt in an electric arc furnace, and then decarburise it in an argon-oxygen decarburisation (<b>AOD)</b> <b>converter.</b> In this work, the thermodynamic basis of preferential carbon oxidation by dilution of oxygen with argon is discussed, together with a review of AOD practice. The AOD process was simulated using computational thermodynamics software to illustrate {{the way in which}} it can achieve very low carbon levels in the molten steel bath without excessive cooxidation of chromium. The slag reduction stage using ferrosilicon additions was also modelled and shown to be able to recover almost all oxidised chromium from the slag, limited only by the accompanying increase in the silicon content of the steel. The models, although simple and easy to develop, correctly predicted all trends in output variables as input parameters were changed and often matched plant data very well. The models provide a valuable learning tool for those interested in pyrometallurgical processing in general, and stainless steelmaking in particular...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{treatment}} {{processes of}} stainless steel, such as pickling, produces acidic waste water consisting of,,,,,,, and. At Sandvik ABs steel works in Sandviken, this waste water is treated and neutralized using slaked lime before being {{released into the}} lake Storsjön. The aim of this report {{was to make a}} literary review of previous work in using slag as a neutralizing agent for acidic waste water. Furthermore, to see if it’s possible to replace {{some or all of the}} slaked lime in the neutralization process with slag and to study what slag that might be suitable to use. Since the waste water contains HF acid, the focus of this report was on different materials used for fluoride adsorptions. The literary study showed that the fluoride adsorption process with BOF slag, quick lime and magnesium oxide as adsorbents were endothermic. Therefore, it benefitted from an increased temperature. Furthermore, the literature study showed that many materials follow a pseudo-second-order kinetic model as well as a Langmuir or Freundlich isotherm for a fluoride adsorption. A previous experiment showed that a mixture of BF slag and slaked lime had the best HF acid neutralization among the tested materials. A fluoride adsorption experiment was made at different temperatures (25 – 55 °C) by using a slag from an aluminium reduced steel melt and a slag from a silicon reduced steel melt from the <b>AOD</b> <b>converter</b> in Sandviken. The silicon reduced steel melt slag showed an increase of fluorides in the solution, due to the presence of calcium fluoride in the slag. This was observed for all temperatures. The aluminium reduced steel melt slag also increased the fluoride content in the solution at 25 and 30 °C. At higher temperatures the fluoride content in the solution decreased with 93. 6 to 94. 9 %...|$|E
40|$|The process {{industries}} span multiple industrial sectors and constitute {{a substantial part}} of the entire manufacturing industry. Since companies belonging to this family of industries are often very asset intensive, their ability to respond to changes is often limited in the short term. The adaptation of the capabilities of existing processes, and conversely finding products and market segments to match the production system capabilities, {{are an important part of}} product- and market development activities in the process industry. The importance to companies in the process industry of having a well-articulated manufacturing strategy congruent with the business strategy is second to none. However, to facilitate manufacturing strategy developments, it is essential to start with an improved characterization and understanding of the material transformation system. To that end an extensive set of variables was developed and related measures and scales were defined. The resulting configuration model, focusing on company generic process capabilities in the {{process industries}}, is to be regarded as a conceptual taxonomy and as a proposition available for further testing. The usability of the model was subsequently assessed using “mini-cases” in the forestry industry, where the respondents confirmed that the company’s overall strategy could benefit from this kind of platform as a possible avenue to follow. The model was deployed as an instrument in the profiling of company material transformation systems to facilitate the further development of companies' functional and business strategies. The use of company-generic production capabilities was studied in three case companies representing the mineral, food and steel industries. The model was found by the respondents to be usable as a knowledge platform to develop production strategies. In the final analysis of the research results, a new concept emerged called “production capability configuration": A process-industrial company’s alignment of its generic production capabilities in the areas of raw materials, process technology and products to improve the consistency among the variable elements that define operations and improve the congruence between operations and its environment. From the perspective of value creation and capture, firms must be able to manufacture products in a competitive cost structure within the framework of a proper business model. By using the configuration model, the relationship between manufacturing and innovation activities has been studied in the previously mentioned three case studies. In many cases the gap in capability appears as a limitation in the production system, requiring development efforts and sometimes investments to overcome. This is illustrated with two examples from the steel industry, where development efforts of the production system capabilities are initiated to better match the market demands. One example is the increase the volume- and product flexibility of an existing stainless steel melt shop, resulting in a proposed oblong Argon Oxygen Decarburisation (<b>AOD)</b> <b>converter</b> configuration that was subsequently verified using water modelling. The second example is from a carbon steel mill, where the target was to increase the raw material- and volume flexibility of another melt shop, by modifying the capabilities of the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). Enabling EAF technologies are further described and evaluated using operational data and engineering type of estimates.   QC 20170116 </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study is to {{increase}} the understanding of different steelmaking processes at the decarburization stages by use of mathematical modeling. More specifically, two De-Laval nozzles from a VOD (Vaccum Oxygen Decarburization) process, which is used for producing stainless steels with ultra-low carbon grades, was investigated for different vessel pressures. Moreover, the post combustion phenomena in a BOF or LD (Linz-Donawitz) process as well as an AOD (Argon Oxygen Decarburization) process were studied focusing on the decarburization stage. Two industrial VOD nozzles were numerically studied and compared at different temperatures and ambient pressures. Flow patterns of the oxygen jet under different ambient pressures were predicted and the flow information at different positions from the nozzle was analyzed. In addition, the effects of different ambient temperatures on the jet velocity and the dynamic pressure were compared. The predictions revealed that a little under-expansion is somewhat helpful to improve the dynamic pressure. The jet dynamic pressure and its width for the specific nozzle geometry were also studied. It was observed that a variation in the ambient pressure can influence the jet momentum and its width. In addition, a high ambient temperature was found to {{have a positive effect on}} the improvement of the jet dynamic pressure. Furthermore, it was found that a change in ambient pressure has a stronger effect on the jet force than a change in the ambient temperature. In addition, it was proved that the profiles of the dynamic pressure at a certain blowing distance fit well to Multi-Gaussian distribution. Post combustion in a BOF/LD and an AOD process during decarburization was also studied. Two mathematical models were created to show the post combustion phenomenon inside the converters, respectively. For the CFD modeling of the two processes, the realizable k-ɛ model, the species transport model and the discrete ordinate were adopted to calculate the turbulence, gas reaction and radiation present in the gas phase in the converter. For the BOF/LD modeling, a series of plant tests were conducted to collect data, which were used in the current model. These include the off-gas information, emissivity data, oxygen blowing parameters and the chemical composition of steel. After the simulation, the predicted flow pattern and detailed information of the gases taking part in the post combustion were compared to plant data. Specifically, the off-gas data from the plant was used for the model verification. The measured CO 2 concentration was 15 - 20 wt% and the predicted value from the modeling was 16. 7 wt%. For the <b>AOD</b> <b>converter</b> of interest in the current work, a fan is installed in the end of the AOD flue to help extract the off-gas from the converter. The influence of different fan gauge pressures as well as temperatures of the gas mixture, containing the generated CO and argon, on the post combustion in the whole AOD system was studied. It was indicated from the modeling results that the post combustion was only present in the flue for the present modeling conditions. Moreover, a critical fan gauge pressure (approx [...] - 550 Pa) was found which could yield a maximum post combustion in the flue gas. For both two models (BOF/LD and AOD), simulations indicated that a change of the converter temperature from 1500 to 1700 °C did not influence the post combustion reaction to a large degree. In addition, these two models can be regarded as the first step for a future more in-depth modeling work of the post combustion. QC 20130913 </p...|$|E
