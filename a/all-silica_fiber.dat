50|$|<b>All-silica</b> <b>fiber,</b> or silica-silica fiber, is {{an optical}} fiber whose core and {{cladding}} {{are made of}} silica glass. The refractive index of the core glass is {{higher than that of}} the cladding. These fibers are typically step-index fibers. The cladding of an <b>all-silica</b> <b>fiber</b> {{should not be confused with}} the polymer overcoat of the fiber.|$|E
50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and fiber optics, a plastic-clad silica fiber or polymer-clad silica fiber (PCS) is an optical fiber {{that has a}} silica-based core and a plastic cladding. The cladding of a PCS fiber {{should not be confused}} with the polymer overcoat of a conventional <b>all-silica</b> <b>fiber.</b> PCS fibers in general have significantly lower performance characteristics, particularly higher transmission losses and lower bandwidths, than all-glass fibers.|$|E
50|$|In {{fiber optic}} technology, a {{reference}} surface is that surface of an optical fiber {{that is used}} to contact the transverse-alignment elements of a component such as a connector or mechanical splice. For telecommunications-grade fibers, the reference surface is the outer surface of the cladding. For plastic-clad silica (PCS) fibers, which have a strippable polymer cladding (not {{to be confused with the}} polymer overcoat of an <b>all-silica</b> <b>fiber),</b> the reference surface may be the core.|$|E
40|$|Measurements of the {{transmission}} of XeCl excimer laser pulses (308 nm) through optical <b>all-silica</b> <b>fibers</b> are reported. The observed photodegradation effects during long time irradiation are dependent on the laser energy density and the laser repetition rate. Also {{the influence of the}} fiber drawing parameters and fiber geometry have been investigated. Absorption spectra of the fibers in the wavelength range from 200 nm to 400 nm before and after the irradiation with the excimer laser give some insight in the physical reasons for the changes in transmission properties.

40|$|International audienceWe study guided {{acoustic}} wave Brillouin scattering (GAWBS) in several photonic crystal fibers (PCF) with {{different kind of}} air-hole microstructure and we show this effect is enhanced {{only for a few}} acoustic phonons. The results of our numerical simulations based on a finite element method reveal that these acosuti waves emitted in the GHz range are indeed trapped within the air-hole microstructure, in good agreement with experimental observations. The periodic wavelength-scale air-hole microstructure of solid-core PCFs can indeed drastically alter the transverse elastic waves distribution and therefore forward Brillouin scattering compared to what is commonly observed in conventional <b>all-silica</b> <b>fibers.</b> We show additionnally that the elasto-optic diffraction coefficient and the transverse acousto-optic field overlap are maximum for these {{acoustic wave}}s. For the most intense GAWBS modes, we investigate the scattering efficiency and temperature dependence of the fundamental phonon frequency for sensing applications...|$|R

We demonstrate that higher order bandgaps in <b>all-silica</b> Bragg <b>fibers</b> can have modes with four orders of magnitude lower confinement loss than those using the fundamental bandgap. A scheme for exploiting the higher order gaps for any specific wavelength via a global scaling of the fiber geometry is proposed. This approach provides lower losses than by reducing the confinement loss of the fundamental gap by scaling the core. Using a variety of modeling techniques, we have examined the band structure and guidance of idealized air-core <b>all-silica</b> Bragg <b>fibers.</b> It is demonstrated that the higher order, low loss, bandgaps analyzed here are uniquely accessible to single-material Bragg fibers, and are fundamentally different from the higher order gaps typically associated with depressed-index Bragg fibers such as the ldquoOmniguiderdquo fibers. Further analysis suggests that some of the key features of the guided modes of Bragg fibers can be understood by considering the properties of single hollow-core homogeneous dielectric waveguides (ldquoboreholesrdquo) ...|$|R
50|$|Hard-clad silica (HCS) or polymer-clad fiber (PCF) is {{an optical}} fiber with {{a core of}} silica glass (diameter: 200 µm) and an optical {{cladding}} made of special plastic (diameter: 230 µm). In contrast to <b>all-silica</b> <b>fiber,</b> the core and cladding can be separated from each other. Due to their medium bandwidths and transmission rates of less than 100 MBit/s, HCS fibers are suitable for distances of up to 2 km, e.g. in local networks in buildings and industry. Generally, the following applies: The higher the attenuation, the shorter the distance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Splice losses between {{standard}} {{step-index fiber}} and holey optical fibers {{were calculated for}} a range of fiber parameters and wavelengths using finite-difference time-domain simulations. The optimal holey fiber parameters for minimum splice loss were determined. It was found that the optimal parameters could also be predicted using analytical approximations incorporating the effective index model. p. 1 / 11 Splice losses in holey optical fibers; J. T. Lizier and G. E. Town Holey optical fiber (HF) is an <b>all-silica</b> optical <b>fiber</b> with an array of longitudinal air holes providing the guidance mechanism. 1 They are an exciting innovation, as their strong guidance and numerous degrees of freedom in design provides the potential for realizing a range of novel fiber devices and applications not possible with standard step index fibers (SIF). However, to be widely useful HF’s must be interfaced with minimal loss to a range of other optical waveguides and devices. Consequently it is important to determine the splice losses between HF and other waveguides, and if possible to optimize the HF structure to minimize splice loss. Loss for a particular SIF to HF splice has bee...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Adiabatically tapered holey fibers {{are shown}} to be {{potentially}} useful for guided-wave spot-size and numerical aperture conversion. Conditions for adiabaticity and design guidelines are provided {{in terms of the}} effective index model. We also present finite-difference time-domain calculations of down-tapered holey fiber, showing that large spot size conversion factors are obtainable with minimal loss using short optimally shaped tapers. p. 1 / 11 Tapered Holey Fibers; G. E. Town and J. T. Lizier Holey optical fiber (HF) is an <b>all-silica</b> optical <b>fiber</b> with an array of longitudinal air holes providing the guidance mechanism. 1 For guidance by total internal reflection, the regime of interest in this paper, the absence of a hole forms a core and the surrounding array of air holes a low effective index cladding. HF exhibits a number of interesting properties not possible in standard step-index fibers (SIF), including single mode operation over an unprecedented range of wavelengths. 2, 3 It follows that at a single wavelength the size of an HF waveguide may be scaled by an appreciable factor and still remain single mode. The latter property is likely to be useful in tapered waveguide devices. A major problem with SIFs is their inefficiency in coupling to integrated optical devices and waveguides, semiconductor devices such as laser diodes, other fiber waveguides with different properties, etc. Coupling losses are caused by mismatch of the modal field distributions, and by changes in effective index or wave impedance. A standard method of reducing coupling losses is to transform the guided mode by an adiabatic transition in waveguide structure (eg. tapering) between the devices to be matched. The weak guidance provided in simple SIF tapers (ie. with no coupling to the cladding mode, 4, 5 and/or lensing 6) usually results in multimode guidance or unacceptable loss before significant transformation of the guided mode can be achieved. Furthermore, the effective index of the guided mode is confined to the narrow range determined by the core and cladding refractive indices...|$|R
