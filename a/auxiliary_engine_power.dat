500|$|In March 1921, Shackleton renamed his {{expedition}} vessel Quest. She {{was a small}} ship, 125tons {{according to}} Huntford, with sail and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> purportedly capable of making eight knots, but in fact rarely making more than five-and-a-half. Huntford describes her as [...] "straight-stemmed", with an awkward square rig, and a tendency to wallow in heavy seas. Fisher reports that she was built in 1917, weighed 204tons, and had a large and spacious deck. Although she had some modern facilities, such as electric lights in the cabins, she was unsuited to long oceanic voyages; Shackleton, {{on the first day}} out, observed that [...] "in no way are we shipshape or fitted to ignore even the mildest storm". Leif Mills, in his biography of Frank Wild, says that had the ship been taken to the Beaufort Sea in accordance with Shackleton's original plans, she would probably have been crushed in the Arctic pack ice. On her voyage south she suffered frequent damage and breakdowns, requiring repairs at every port of call.|$|E

50|$|The Jagdpanzer IV used a {{modified}} Panzer IV Ausf. H chassis, but the almost-vertical front hull plate {{was replaced by}} sloped armor plates. Internally, the layout was changed to accommodate the new superstructure, moving the fuel tanks and ammunition racks. Since the Jagdpanzer lacked a turret, the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> which <b>powered</b> the Panzer IV's turret traverse mechanism could be eliminated.|$|R
5000|$|During World War I, the British Coastal class blimps, one {{of several}} types of airship {{operated}} by the Royal Navy, carried a [...] ABC <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine.</b> These <b>powered</b> a generator for the craft's radio transmitter and, in an emergency, could power an auxiliary air blower. One of the first military fixed-wing aircraft to use an APU was the British, World War 1, Supermarine Nighthawk, an anti-Zeppelin Night fighter.|$|R
50|$|The Fell {{system was}} the first third-rail system for {{railways}} that were too steep to be worked by adhesion on the two running rails alone. It uses a raised centre rail between the two running rails to provide extra traction and braking, or braking alone. Trains are propelled by wheels or braked by shoes pressed horizontally onto the centre rail, {{as well as by}} the normal running wheels. Extra brake shoes are fitted to specially designed or adapted Fell locomotives and brake vans, and for traction the locomotive has an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> <b>powering</b> horizontal wheels which clamp onto the third rail. The Fell system was developed in the 1860s and was soon superseded by various types of rack railway for new lines, but some Fell systems remained in use into the 1960s. The Snaefell Mountain Railway still uses the Fell system for (emergency) braking, but not for traction.|$|R
50|$|In the Fell locomotive, {{however, the}} four main drive engines {{received}} their charge from Roots blowers driven by two further <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines</b> which were governed such {{that when the}} traction power demand was more than minimal, they operated at essentially a constant speed. Since a Roots blower is a positive-displacement device, {{this meant that the}} mass flow rate at which charge was delivered to the main engines depended not on the speed of the main engines but on that of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines,</b> so the <b>power</b> output of the main engines was essentially defined by the speed of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Columbia, {{designed}} by shipwright Edward Faron, was about 300 ft long with about 310 ft visible above the waterline. She had {{a beam of}} 38 ft and a depth of 23 ft. She had two compound condensing steam engines with a 42.5 in and 82 in by 54 in stroke driving a single Hirsch four bladed propeller with a diameter of 16 ft. The propeller had a mean pitch of 27 ft and could do 65 revolutions per minute. The blades of the propeller were able to be removed individually or all at once. <b>Powering</b> the <b>engine</b> were six boilers with a diameter of 12 ft and a length of 12 ft each. Each boiler had a working pressure of [...] Columbia was a coal powered steamship, able to carry a maximum of 300 tons of coal within her bunkers. She had an estimated top speed of 16 kn. She also carried a single donkey boiler and an <b>auxiliary</b> steam <b>engine</b> which <b>powered</b> the bilge and could supply water to the boilers should the fires break out of control. A second <b>auxiliary</b> steam <b>engine</b> <b>powered</b> the ship's electricity. Columbia had an auxiliary Brigantine rig sail plan with over 15000 yd of canvas. The sails would be rigged upon two iron masts.|$|R
40|$|In port, {{when the}} ship is {{berthing}} the loading, unloading, and hospitality activity is using <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine.</b> The combustion of marine fuels is {{a major contributor to}} air pollution, the air pollution is released 400 km around the port area. The impacts of the pollution are respiratory, health, and the environment around ports. Study indicates 60. 000 of cardiopulmonary mortalities caused by ship air emission. Ship emission represents 3 % of global CO 2, 15 % of global NO x, and 6 % of global SO x emission. Because of that Hamburg Port is released the shore power facilities in July 2015 with idea of smart port and use the renewable energy such as wind turbine and solar panel compliance with IEC-ISO-IEEE 8005 - 1. In this bachelor thesis, the cost and also the condition between shore <b>power</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> will be analyzed and compared to find the most economical between shore power facilities and ship’s <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine.</b> Shore <b>power</b> facilities in Hamburg are provided by SIEMENS with SIHARBOR and use a robot arm by Stemman Technik as the cable management system. The goal of this thesis is developed calculation tool to see the cost comparison and also the emission. And from the calculation tool the shore power is reducing the emission by 100 % because of using the renewable energy and become economical than using <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine,</b> it can save up to € 1000. The other benefits  are ship owner can save maintenance of their <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> and also saved the file.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{international}} trade and maritime operation have played an increasingly significant role in providing international cargo and passenger transportation. Consequently, seaports over the world are suffering from the problem of fuel consumption and exhaust gases coming from ships during their stopover in harbors. Ships at berth generate electricity by means of their <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines,</b> and emit air pollutants and noise. As a result, ports become an important and growing source of pollution and can create significant risks for the health of nearby communities. Costs involved in the shore-side power program can vary widely among ports. In this paper economic and environmental analysis related to ships and shore-side power have been studied Additionally, the practicability, costs and benefits of switching from onboard ship <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines</b> to shore-side <b>power</b> connection for a ro/ro ship while berthed at Civitavecchia port have been investigated...|$|R

40|$|Engine room {{monitoring}} {{control system}} is monitoring and controlling main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> from long distance by powerline communication network and wireless network {{to ease the}} operator in operating the ship and save operational cost. To prevent error in programming the main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine,</b> a simulation using instrument software is needed to know the machine characteristic. After simulation result fulfills the requirement which is approached the value of test record, it {{can be applied to}} the real machine. In this study, some steps were done such as: getting know type of main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> which performance will be simulated and programmed, getting test record of main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine,</b> getting know how the main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> work, making simulation of main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> work system, doing monitoring control simulation by powerline communication and wireless network, comparing the results between simulation and test record of main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine.</b> Engine programming can be set after simulation result meets the requirement.

40|$|The {{benefits}} of wave rotor-topping in turboshaft engines, subsonic high-bypass turbofan <b>engines,</b> <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> units, and ground power units are evaluated. The thermodynamic cycle performance is modeled using a one-dimensional steady-state code; wave rotor performance is modeled using one-dimensional design/analysis codes. Design and off-design engine performance is calculated for baseline engines and wave rotor-topped engines, where the wave rotor {{acts as a}} high pressure spool. The wave rotor-enhanced engines are shown to have benefits in specific power and specific fuel flow over the baseline engines without increasing turbine inlet temperature. The off-design steady-state behavior of a wave rotor-topped engine is shown {{to be similar to}} a conventional engine. Mission studies are performed to quantify aircraft performance benefits for various wave rotor cycle and weight parameters.
