5|$|Ambrose's height, and the {{accuracy}} {{with which he}} bowled, {{made it difficult for}} batsmen to play forward to the ball; instead they were forced to play with their weight going back. His accuracy meant that he was effective if the pitch favoured batsmen. He bowled an effective yorker, and unlike other fast bowlers, used short-pitched deliveries sparingly, although he could bowl a hostile bouncer, and concentrated on bowling a full length aimed at the wickets. Ambrose rarely engaged in verbal sparring with batsmen, although in later years he occasionally inspected the pitch in an area close to the batsman before an innings began <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>his</b> hands to suggest that he would enjoy bowling there. He always aimed to concede as few runs as possible when bowling, and frequently berated himself when he offered an easy delivery from which to score. Following his dismissal of a batsman, Ambrose often celebrated by pumping the air with his fists. With Courtney Walsh, Ambrose developed a reputation for performing at his best when his team seemed likely to lose, and he often took wickets in clusters which devastated the opposition. In addition, he was often most effective against the leading batsmen on a team; he was also capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in the techniques of other batsmen.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the walk}} began, Wallenda {{realized}} the wire had become slippery due to gathered dust. [...] He spat {{on his hands}} <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>his</b> shoes for better grip. Shortly thereafter, he stopped and crouched down on the wire due to wind gusts. [...] He later stopped a second time to break the bounce of the wire that his walking had induced. [...] Throughout the walk, Wallenda could be heard praying, repeatedly saying [...] "Thank you, Jesus." [...] Wallenda ran the last few steps then jumped off and kissed the ground. [...] Completing the walk in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, Wallenda became {{the first person to}} highwire walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge.|$|E
