5|$|People {{struggled}} to survive together, and a rich culture based on shebeens (informal and mostly illegal pubs), mbaqanga music and beer-brewing developed. The shebeens {{were one of}} the main forms of entertainment. People came to the shebeens not only for skokiaan or baberton (illegally self-made alcoholic beverages), but to talk about their daily worries, their political ideas and their fears and hopes. In these shebeens the politicians tried to influence others <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> conform to their form of thinking. If one disagreed he immediately became suspect and was classified as a police informer.|$|E
5|$|The {{song of the}} American {{goldfinch}} is {{a series}} of musical warbles and twitters, often with a long note. A tsee-tsi-tsi-tsit call is often given in flight; it may also be described as per-chic-o-ree. While the female incubates the eggs, she calls to her returning mate with a soft continuous teeteeteeteete sound. The young begin to use a call of chick-kee or chick-wee shortly before fledging, which they use until they have left the nest entirely. There are two defense calls made by adults during nesting; a sweeet call made to rally other goldfinches to the nest and distract predators, and a bearbee used to signal to the nestlings to quiet them <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> crouch down in the nest to become less conspicuous.|$|E

25|$|In the Spring of 1855, as the Crimean war developed, Darwin was {{pondering the}} war of nature, taking the then current analogy with an {{industrial}} economy further than others, and wondering how species spread. He was dismissive of the ideas that others had put forward of sunken continents like Atlantis, and began experimenting in his house with soaking seeds in brine then seeing if they could germinate. He reported his results in Gardeners' Chronicle and roped in his curate friends including Henslow. The consul in Norway sent seed pods which had washed ashore. Hooker was able to identify them as coming from the Caribbean <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> germinate at Kew. Investigation of variation {{brought him back to}} animal husbandry. He now began dissecting domestic animals and breeding pigeons, joining a pigeon fancier's club: very unorthodox behaviour for naturalists at that time.|$|E
25|$|Amrita Sher-Gil {{was born}} on 30 January 1913 in Budapest, Hungary, to Umrao Singh Sher-Gil Majithia, a Sikh aristocrat and a scholar in Sanskrit and Persian, and Marie Antoniette Gottesmann, a Hungarian-Jewish opera singer who came from an {{affluent}} bourgeois family. Her parents first met in 1912, while Marie Antoinette was visiting Lahore. Her mother came to India as a companion of Princess Bamba Sutherland, the granddaughter of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Sher-Gil was the elder of two daughters; her younger sister was Indira Sundaram (née Sher-Gil), born in March 1914), mother of the contemporary artist Vivan Sundaram. She spent most of early childhood in Budapest. She was the niece of Indologist Ervin Baktay. Baktay noticed Sher-Gil's artistic talents {{during his visit to}} Shimla in 1926 and was an advocate of Sher-Gil pursuing art. He guided her by critiquing her work and gave her an academic foundation to grow on. When she was a young girl she would paint the servants in her house, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> model for her. The memories of these models would eventually lead to her return to India. Her first teachers were Major Whitmarsh, who was later replaced by Beven Pateman. She attended Santa Annuciata, Florence.|$|E
25|$|FLOC {{was founded}} in September 1967 by Baldemar Velásquez and his father. Velásquez had been deeply {{influenced}} by the ideas of César Chávez, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Initially, his goal was merely to organize the farmworkers {{so that they could}} cooperate with the growers to improve pay, housing, and education for the pickers. Sensing that the farmworkers would not take a 20-year-old student seriously, Velásquez relied on his father to gather the employees <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> listen to him. He even sent volunteer organizers to Texas during the winter to talk to and organize the workers during their months away from work. But the effort largely failed, and in September 1968 Velásquez called a strike against 10 tomato growers in Ohio. Five growers signed contracts recognizing the union, agreeing to a minimum wage and limited health insurance, and promising not to discriminate against union members or union organizers. Within a few weeks, 21 other growers had agreed to contracts with FLOC as well. But in the following year, sustained anti-union opposition from the growers (backed by the American Farm Bureau Federation), the withdrawal of some growers from the tomato market, the refusal of some growers to honor their contracts, and the efforts of some growers to raise wages and improve working conditions (which led employees to abandon the union) caused Velásquez to rethink his organizing strategy.|$|E

500|$|Although Alkin {{acted as}} one of the newsbook sellers, between 1650 and 1651 she {{published}} several short-lived newsbooks, including The Impartial Scout, The Moderne Intelligencer, Mercurius Anglicus (formerly a royalist title which she appropriated) and Mercurius Scoticus, or, The Royal Messenger. Clarke believes Alkin may have used formerly royalist titles, or royalist-sounding names to win the confidence of royalist sympathisers, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> reveal the location of illicit printers. The historian Marcus Nevitt disagrees, and argues that Alkin was [...] "reappropriating Royalist titles for Parliamentarian consumption". In total she produced ten notebook issues of differing titles.|$|E
500|$|During {{the reign}} of Elizabeth I, Gray's Inn rose in prominence, and that period is {{considered}} the [...] "golden age" [...] of the Inn, with Elizabeth serving as the Patron Lady. This {{can be traced to}} the actions of Nicholas Bacon, William Cecil and Gilbert Gerard, all prominent members of the Inn and confidantes of Elizabeth. Cecil and Bacon in particular took pains to find the most promising young men <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> join the Inn. In 1574 it was the largest of all the Inns of Court by number, with 120 barristers, and by 1619 it had a membership of more than 200 barristers.|$|E
500|$|In September 2005, Woodstock {{resident}} Scott Wayne Indiana tied {{his first}} plastic toy horse to a horse ring {{located in the}} Pearl District. Of his attempt {{to draw attention to}} the rings, and to celebrate Portland's history, Indiana said: [...] "I loved the rings, and felt that people just weren't noticing them. This was an attempt to shake people out of their routines <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> notice their surroundings." [...] Since then, the Horse Project has gained momentum and participation; horses can be found tied to rings throughout the city, especially in east Portland. The installations have sparked interaction with residents, who have left hay, lassoes, riders, saddles, water, wool blankets, and other [...] "treats" [...] for the horses. Horses are often defaced or go missing.|$|E

Sims would later explain, [...] "most people wait [...] until after they've grown up—and then it's too late." [...] That same year, clogger Ira Bernstein received an NEA Folk Arts Apprenticeship grant [...] "o study traditional lack tap dance with master dancer Howard 'Sandman' Sims."

500|$|Combat is {{triggered}} through random {{encounters in}} environments such as dungeons. Combat in Nine plays {{out as a}} real-time combat in an enclosed battle arena: while the battle continues automatically without direct interaction from the player, commands can be issued to party members to perform actions when their turn comes. In addition to specific commands, general offensive or defensive stances can be issued. Battles do not reward experience points as in other Megami Tensei games: instead, equipped jewels affect the protagonist's strengths and stats. As with previous Megami Tensei games, players can negotiate with demons <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> join their party. Demons can also be fused together to create more powerful demons. The attitudes of demons towards the player changes depending on the current moon phase. The number of demons the player can summon depends on the player's and the demon's [...] "kilodevil" [...] values: a player with 100 kilodevil can summon two 50-kilodevil demons. The player can compress their demons by visiting the Cathedral of Shadows, halving the demons' kilodevil values and allowing the player to summon more demons.|$|E
500|$|Just {{before midnight}} on 2 September, the mutineers messaged the Chilean {{government}} {{with a more}} [...] "sophisticated" [...] list of twelve demands. Meanwhile, further south, junior members of the navy in the main naval base of Talcahuano joined the mutiny, taking several vessels in the process. Several of these sailed north to join the other rebels, while two cruisers, a few destroyers and submarines remained to guard the base. Other bases joined the now-full-fledged rebellion as well, including the Second Air Group based in Quintero. With so many rebels appearing, it was feared by many that the plethora of unemployed workers would join. The government attempted to solicit aid from the United States {{in the form of}} military intervention or war materiel (including two submarines and bombs capable of penetrating the armor of Almirante Latorre), but they were rebuffed both publicly and privately. Acting Vice President Manuel Trucco now found himself in an undesirable position; he had to defeat the rebels before more units joined and bolstered their forces, but if he was too harsh, there was a risk that the populace would think that his policies were too similar to the former dictator Ibáñez del Campo. Trucco decided on a path of reconciliation. He sent a naval admiral, Edgardo von Schroeders, to negotiate with the mutineers. They met on board Almirante Latorre, where von Schroeders, seeing a potential split between sailors angry over their pay versus others with a more political agenda, tried to divide them along these lines <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> surrender. However, a plea from the approaching southern fleet, asking for them to wait before any possible settlement, sealed the matter for the time being and von Schroders flew back to the capital.|$|E

Chapter thirteen has Abbot Eadred of Carlisle go across the Tyne to the Danes <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> elect Guthred, [...] "a slave of a certain widow", as king [...] Guthred consequently is made king on a hill named Oswigesdune, and the Viking host swears its peace and fidelity over the body of St Cuthbert, which Bishop Eardulf had brought for that purpose. In chapter fourteen the army of Ubba and Halfdan divides into three parts, settling in and around York, in Mercia, and among the southern Saxons, killing all the royals except Alfred the Great, who retreats into the marshes of Glastonbury low on provisions. In the following chapter (fifteen), Alfred is kind to a stranger who comes to him in need, ordering that he receive some of the remaining food. The stranger disappears and Alfred is rewarded with three boatloads of fish. Chapter sixteen has St Cuthbert visit Alfred during the night, revealing that he was the stranger, that he will be the defender of Alfred and his sons, and that Alfred and his sons are the chosen kings of all Britain. In the subsequent three chapters St Cuthbert's relationship to Alfred is compared with that of St Peter to King Edwin and of the Prophet Samuel to King David (chapter seventeen), Alfred's just character is celebrated (eighteen), and the king's donation, through his son Edward the Elder, of a golden thurible and two armlets, is recorded (nineteen).|$|E
