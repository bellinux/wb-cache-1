5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E

2500|$|The minor elixirs for recalling a man's {{ethereal}} breaths, {{the pills}} for countering the three Messenger-corpses , and lesser medicines {{made from the}} Five Brilliances and the Eight Minerals will sometimes melt hard ice instantly or keep one afloat in water. They can intercept ghosts and gods, lay tigers and leopards, and disperse accumulations in the digestive system and our organs. They dislodge the two lackeys of illness from the heart region and the diaphragm (Tso, Ch'eng 10.5); they raise those who have just died; return frightened ethereal breaths to the body they had quit. All these are common, everyday medicines. <b>And,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> still restore the dead to life, why should the superior medicines {{not be able to}} make the living immortal?

2500|$|Observing the Sabbath on Sunday, {{the day of}} resurrection, {{gradually}} became the dominant Christian practice from the Jewish-Roman wars onward. The Church's general repudiation of Jewish practices during this period is apparent in the Council of Laodicea (4th century AD) where Canons 37â€“38 state: [...] "It is not lawful to receive portions sent from the feasts of Jews or heretics, nor to feast together with them" [...] and [...] "It is not lawful to receive unleavened bread from the Jews, nor to be partakers of their impiety". Canon 29 of the Laodicean council specifically refers to the sabbath: [...] "Christians must not judaize by resting on the [...] Sabbath, but must work on that day, rather honouring the Lord's Day; <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> resting then as Christians.

60|$|It {{is curious}} to observe, {{that in every}} state of society, some sort of ghostly {{consolation}} is provided {{for the members of}} the community, though assembled for purposes diametrically opposite to religion.
