Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may {{have as many as}} nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make offerings to them as to a deity.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN has {{recommended}} co-operation between countries across the cheetah's range to minimise {{the conflict between}} cheetahs <b>and</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> A 2016 study showed that ecotourism can have a significantly {{positive impact on the}} conservation of the cheetah. Although the requirement of space for the habitat would have to be compromised in most cases, establishment of private reserves for cheetahs and ensuring the absence of predators and poachers could be a successful conservation measure. Additionally, the financial benefits accrued and the awareness generated can further aid the cause of the cheetah. At the same time, the animals should not be unnecessarily handled or disturbed, as cheetahs are particularly sensitive to human interference.|$|E

25|$|According to post-Conquest sources (Maya and Spanish), pre-Columbian Maya sacrificed objects <b>and</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> {{into the}} cenote {{as a form}} of worship to the Maya rain god Chaac. Edward Herbert Thompson dredged the Cenote Sagrado from 1904 to 1910, and {{recovered}} artifacts of gold, jade, pottery and incense, as well as human remains. A study of human remains taken from the Cenote Sagrado found that they had wounds consistent with human sacrifice.|$|E

While biology remains the centerpiece of life science, technological advances in molecular biology and biotechnology have led to a burgeoning of specializations and new, often interdisciplinary, fields.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{improper}} {{disposal of}} human {{waste in the}} mountain environment there is high risk of health hazards. Human faeces are very dangerous; they contain over 100 bacteria, protozoans and viruses that, without a specialised recycling process, {{pose a threat to}} both animals <b>and</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> Only boiled or chemically treated water is accepted for drinking. Decent changes have appeared in recent years–management bodies care more about human waste disposal. The authorities in mountain regions are gradually exchanging the old, leaking toilets for newer, eco–friendly models.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I will discuss how Hegel made the {{critique}} of Solger's opinions about the conciliation between God <b>and</b> the <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> Because Sogler opposes according to Hegel's opinion God as the infinite <b>and</b> the <b>human</b> existence as the finite, the conciliation between God <b>and</b> the <b>human</b> <b>being</b> in Solger's philosophy is not successful. Through the interpretation of Hegel's opinions about the Greek tragedy and the Crucifixion of Christ it is pointed out, that the true conciliation between God <b>and</b> the <b>human</b> <b>being</b> can according to Hegel happen, only when the human existence is completely perfected...|$|R

25|$|The {{appearance}} of the chess pieces had altered greatly since the times of chaturanga, with ornate pieces and chess pieces depicting animals giving way to abstract shapes. This is because of a Muslim ban on the game’s lifelike pieces, as they {{were said to have}} brought upon images of idolatry. The Islamic sets of later centuries followed a pattern which assigned names and abstract shapes to the chess pieces, as Islam forbids depiction of animals <b>and</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> in art. These pieces were usually made of simple clay and carved stone.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the legends}} are {{interconnected}} in the Bhagavata. The text asserts that gods (Deva), demons (Asuras) <b>and</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> do things, and behave in {{good or evil}} ways, in part, because of their past experiences and their innate evolving natures (Guṇa). The evil behavior of demon king Hiranyakasipu in Book 7, for example, against his own son Prahlada for his Bhakti for Vishnu, is not simply because of demonic Tamasic Guṇa but also because Vishnu in his Varaha avatar had killed Hiranyakasipu's brother Hiranyaksa in Book 2. Hiranyakasipu turned vengeful against Vishnu ever since then, and had refused to consider whether Hiranyaksa deserved to die.|$|E

Many fruits, flowers, and seeds stand out more strongly from the background in ultraviolet wavelengths {{as compared to}} human color vision. Scorpions glow or take on a yellow to green color under UV illumination, thus assisting in the control of these arachnids. Many birds have patterns in their plumage that are invisible at usual wavelengths but observable in ultraviolet, and the urine and other secretions of some animals, including dogs, cats, <b>and</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> {{is much easier to}} spot with ultraviolet.

I have had my first visit to a native village where goats, sheep <b>and</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is about ten feet, sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered a disgrace for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.|$|E

The text reasserts its non-dualism in Chapter 3, adding that bhakti to Vishnu is the path to liberating knowledge of Brahman.
