500|$|David Hinckley of the New York Daily News gave The American Bible Challenge a {{positive}} review, saying, [...] "Anyone who knows even <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Bible {{will be unable}} to resist playing along and matching answers with the teams on the screen." [...] Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times was also pleased, calling the show [...] "nothing if not magnanimous, sending even the losing teams home with a little something for their charities. A spirit of good will prevails." [...] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post was critical, calling the series [...] "just as dull as it sounds," [...] and arguing that [...] "weariness" [...] could be detected in Foxworthy's hosting. Rebecca Cusey of Patheos recommended the series for Christians in particular, saying, [...] "Those that take the Bible as the word of God will enjoy this show." [...] Additionally, Bounce TV expressed excitement when announcing their acquisition of the series in 2013; network chief operating officer Jonathan Katz commented, [...] "We are very confident that the broadcast premieres of The American Bible Challenge and Catch 21 will add fuel to Bounce TV’s skyrocketing growth." ...|$|E

[...] Eventually, The New Yorker opined that the speech helped elect Obama as the President of the United States.|$|E

2500|$|A second {{article from}} the Mission Hill Gazette {{published}} one April 3, 2015, [...] "BRA creating 'Avenue of Arts' design guidelines, talks about guidelines used for new developments. A direct {{quote from the}} article talks <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> guidelines expected for future construction, [...] "The guidelines would suggest such aspects as the mass of buildings, pedestrian facilities, and the materials and colors used in construction." [...] There was a meeting held the previous week where {{members of the public}} voided that they want these guidelines to extend farther in Mission Hill. I think this is important to note because that means changes will be made to future construction in this area.|$|E
2500|$|Torsten Billman's cousin on his mother's side Nils Svahn (1890–1936) was an {{editorial}} cartoonist {{at the newspaper}} Social-Demokraten, in Stockholm 1920–29. During Torsten's visit in Stockholm {{in the autumn of}} 1929, Nils explained <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> woodcut for Torsten. Returned to Kullavik from military service in the Navy in Karlskrona, as a stoker on HMS Sverige 1929–30, he made his first woodcuts Hands (1930) and Thirst (1930) as an unemployed stoker. Billman had not been to any art museum or anything like that and he know nothing about woodcut technique, so his first wood engravings was cut out of the wood of a margarine case with an ordinary carpenter's knife. Artistically he was [...] "the complete savage", but he became interested when he saw reproductions of Frans Masereel and Käthe Kollwitz and when he later saw lithographs by Honoré Daumier it was a stirring experience for him.|$|E
2500|$|Lord Bowen was {{regarded}} with great affection by all {{who knew him}} either professionally or privately. He had a polished and graceful wit, of which many instances might be given, although such anecdotes lose force in print. For example, when it was suggested {{on the occasion of}} an address to Queen Victoria, to be presented by her judges, that a passage in it, [...] "conscious as we are of our shortcomings," [...] suggested too great humility, he proposed the emendation [...] "conscious as we are of one another's shortcomings"; and on another occasion he defined a jurist as [...] "a person who knows <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> laws of every country except his own". Lord Bowen's judicial reputation will rest upon the series of judgments delivered by him in the court of appeal, which are remarkable for their lucid interpretation of legal principles as applied to the facts and business of life.|$|E
