6000|$|There is no <b>animal</b> <b>fibre</b> {{that will}} not yield itself up to long-continued, steady heat. But the {{difficulty}} with almost any of the common servants who call themselves cooks is, {{that they have not}} the smallest notion of the philosophy of the application of heat. Such a one will complacently tell you, concerning certain meats, that the harder you boil them the harder they grow,--an obvious fact, which, under her mode of treatment by an indiscriminate galloping boil, has frequently come under her personal observation. If you tell her that such meat must stand for six hours in a heat just below the boiling-point, she will probably answer, [...] "Yes, ma'am," [...] and go on her own way. Or she will let it stand till it burns {{to the bottom of the}} kettle,--a most common termination of the experiment. The only way to make sure of the matter is either to import a French kettle, or to fit into an ordinary kettle a false bottom, such as any tinman may make, that shall leave a space of an inch or two between the meat and the fire. This kettle may be maintained as a constant habitué of the range, and into it the cook may be instructed to throw all the fibrous trimmings of meat, all the gristle, tendons, and bones, having previously broken up these last with a mallet.|$|E
6000|$|This morning I {{have been}} reading [...] "the False One." [...] Shameful to say, I was in bed at ten--I mean this morning. The Blackwood Reviewers have {{committed}} themselves in a scandalous heresy--they have been putting up Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, against Burns: the senseless villains! The Scotch cannot manage themselves at all, they want imagination, {{and that is why}} they are so fond of Hogg, who has a little of it. This morning I am in a sort of temper, indolent and supremely careless--I long after a Stanza or two of Thomson's Castle of Indolence--my passions are all asleep, from my having slumbered till nearly eleven, and weakened the <b>animal</b> <b>fibre</b> all over me, to a delightful sensation, about three degrees on this side of faintness. If I had teeth of pearl and the breath of lilies I should call it languor, but as I am[B] I must call it laziness. In this state of effeminacy the fibres of the brain are relaxed in common {{with the rest of the}} body, and to such a happy degree that pleasure has no show of enticement and pain no unbearable power. Neither Poetry, nor Ambition, nor Love have any alertness of countenance as they pass by me; they seem rather like figures on a Greek vase--a Man and two women whom no one but myself could distinguish in their disguisement.[91] This is the only happiness, and is a rare instance of the advantage of the body overpowering the Mind. I have this moment received a note from Haslam, in which he expects the death of his Father, who has been for some time in a state of insensibility; his mother bears up he says very well--I shall go to town to-morrow to see him. This is the world--thus we cannot expect to give way many hours to pleasure. Circumstances are like Clouds continually gathering and bursting--While we are laughing, the seed of some trouble is put into the wide arable land of events--while we are laughing it sprouts it grows and suddenly bears a poison fruit which we must pluck. Even so we have leisure to reason on the misfortunes of our friends; our own touch us too nearly for words. Very few men have ever arrived at a complete disinterestedness of Mind: very few have been influenced by a pure desire of the benefit of others,--in the greater part of the Benefactors to Humanity some meretricious motive has sullied their greatness--some melodramatic scenery has fascinated them. From the manner in which I feel Haslam's misfortune I perceive how far I am from any humble standard of disinterestedness. Yet this feeling ought to be carried to its highest pitch, as there is no fear of its ever injuring society--which it would do, I fear, pushed to an extremity. For in wild nature the Hawk would lose his Breakfast of Robins and the Robin his of Worms--The Lion must starve as well as the swallow. The greater part of Men make their way with the same instinctiveness, the same unwandering eye from their purposes, the same animal eagerness as the Hawk. The Hawk wants a Mate, so does the Man--look at them both, they set about it and procure one in the same manner. They want both a nest and they both set about one in the same manner--they get their food in the same manner. The noble animal Man for his amusement smokes his pipe--the Hawk balances about the Clouds--that is the only difference of their leisures. This it is that makes the Amusement of Life--to a speculative Mind--I go among the Fields and catch a glimpse of a Stoat or a fieldmouse peeping out of the withered grass--the creature hath a purpose, and its eyes are bright with it. I go amongst the buildings of a city and I see a Man hurrying along--to what? the Creature has a purpose and his eyes are bright with it. But then, as Wordsworth says, [...] "we have all one human heart----" [...] There is an electric fire in human nature tending to purify--so that among these human creatures there is continually some birth of new heroism. The pity is that we must wonder at it, as we should at finding a pearl in rubbish. I have no doubt that thousands of people never heard of have had hearts completely disinterested: I can remember but two--Socrates and Jesus--Their histories evince it. What I heard a little time ago, Taylor observe with respect to Socrates, may be said of Jesus--That he was so great a man that though he transmitted no writing of his own to posterity, we have his Mind and his sayings and his greatness handed to us by others. It is to be lamented that the history of the latter was written and revised by Men interested in the pious frauds of Religion. Yet through all this I see his splendour. Even here, though I myself am pursuing the same instinctive course as the veriest human animal you can think of, I am, however young, writing at random, straining at particles of light in the midst of a great darkness, without knowing the bearing of any one assertion, of any one opinion. Yet may I not in this be free from sin? May there not be superior beings amused with any graceful, though instinctive, attitude my mind may fall into as I am entertained with the alertness of a Stoat or the anxiety of a Deer? Though a quarrel in the Streets is a thing to be hated, the energies displayed in it are fine; the commonest Man shows a grace in his quarrel. By a superior Being our reasonings may take the same tone--though erroneous they may be fine. This is the very thing in which consists Poetry, and if so it is not so fine a thing as philosophy--For the same reason that an eagle is not so fine a thing as a truth. Give me this credit--Do you not think I strive--to know myself? Give me this credit, and you will not think that on my own account I repeat Milton's lines-- ...|$|E

40|$|A {{substantial}} up-to-date {{reference manual}} has been prepared which documents important {{issues for the}} supply chain of rare natural <b>animal</b> <b>fibres.</b> New developments in textiles have been included. Cashmere, mohair and camelid fibres have special properties of softness, smoothness and lustre, when compared with sheep wool. They also have other attributes which affect market prices and consumer perceptions, such as being rare and exotic luxuries, and are associated with expensive, comfortable and exclusive garments. These fibres add to the range of wool processing, and add value to wool textiles. Generally, knowledge about these <b>animal</b> <b>fibres</b> is limited, and research effort small compared with research into wool and other natural and man-made fibres. Compared with wool, rare natural <b>animal</b> <b>fibres</b> are more difficult and costly to process. Knowledge about processing these fibres is kept guarded as industrial knowledge. There are problems with clearly identifying rare natural <b>animal</b> <b>fibres</b> when goods are traded or fibres are blended, and fraud {{is a major concern}} for textile manufacturers and industry groups. Prickle discomfort in mohair and alpaca next-to-skin wear is a major concern for consumers and textile manufacturers.

50|$|Thermal {{insulation}} {{in buildings}} {{is an important}} factor to achieving thermal comfort for its occupants. Insulation reduces unwanted heat loss or gain and can decrease the energy demands of heating and cooling systems. It does not necessarily deal with issues of adequate ventilation and may or may not affect the level of sound insulation. In a narrow sense insulation can just refer to the insulation materials employed to slow heat loss, such as: cellulose, glass wool, rock wool, polystyrene, urethane foam, vermiculite, perlite, wood fibre, plant fibre (cannabis, flax, cotton, cork, etc.), recycled cotton denim, plant straw, <b>animal</b> <b>fibre</b> (sheep's wool), cement, and earth or soil, Reflective Insulation (also known as Radiant Barrier) but it can also involve a range of designs and techniques to address the main modes of heat transfer - conduction, radiation and convection materials. Many of the materials in this list deal with heat conduction and convection by the simple expedient of trapping large amounts of air (or other gas) in a way that results in a material that employs the low thermal conductivity of small pockets of gas, rather than the much higher conductivity of typical solids. (A similar gas-trapping principle is used in animal hair, down feathers, and in air-containing insulating fabrics).|$|E
5000|$|With {{a view to}} {{determine}} the changes which <b>animal</b> <b>fibre</b> might undergo by exposing it to the action of Port wine, six portions of the small intestines of a kitten were taken. Three of these were introduced into a phial, which was nearly filled with Port wine, and closed with a cork; and the remaining three were immersed in water, as a standard. Being placed in a cool situation during three days, the portions {{in contact with the}} wine were found to have greater firmness than those that were immersed in the water. The sum of the weights required to break the former was 9 lb. 0 oz.; the sum of those required to break the latter was 7 lb. 4 oz. .... With a view to guard against error in trials of this nature, it is of importance that the portions of the intestine should be as nearly as possible of the same length. They should likewise have nearly the same degree of curvature. For a very curved portion of the intestine is more easily broken than a straight one.... If the trials be frequently repeated, results will be obtained that approach near to the truth.... From the foregoing trials, it appears, that the firmness, elasticity, and strength of the intestines of a kitten are considerably increased by immersing them three days in Port wine. I have found, however, that a much less time than this is sufficient for the wine to produce its full effect. In several experiments a manifest increase of cohesion appeared to have taken place in less than an hour; and after ten hours have elapsed, I believe no farther augmentation is produced.|$|E

40|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscopy (SEM) {{is currently the}} most reliable method to identify animal fibres and to determine the composition of <b>animal</b> <b>fibre</b> mixtures. The SEM-analysis is time consuming and requires an operator experienced in <b>animal</b> <b>fibre</b> analysis. There is the need of objective criteria, which {{make it possible to}} evaluate the microscopic pictures in an automated process. One of the major problems is the detection of the edge heights of the cuticle scales. These are of particular significance for the differentiation of wool and speciality fibres. The approach pursued in this work is the analysis of two-dimensional fibre profiles, which potentially can be obtained in an automated process, either with profilometric methods or through edge detection in microscopic fibre photographs. Especially white-light interferometry, light microscopy and scanning {{electron microscopy}} are used. The profiles are submitted to Fourier-analysis and the obtained spectra are evaluated with regard to the height and length of the cuticle scales as well as to their variation. Models for <b>animal</b> <b>fibre</b> profiles are developed and analysed. This leads to parameters that facilitate the interpretation of the spectra of <b>animal</b> <b>fibre</b> profiles. One set of parameters, the area under the spectrum and the position of the main peak in the smoothed spectrum, is directly derived from the amplitude spectrum and relates to the height and length of the cuticle scales of the fibres. Another set of four parameters is obtained by fitting a symmetric distribution function to a spectrum which has a logarithmic frequency axis. This function is a mixture of the Gauß- and Lorentz-distribution. The four parameters relate to the height and length of the cuticle scales of the fibres as well as their variation. Within the context of a discriminant analysis, these parameters enable to quantitatively identify the composition of fibre mixtures. Taking into account the hit rate for single fibres, the composition of merino-cashmere mixtures can be determined with an error of 3 %. The comparison of hit rates in the discriminant analysis shows no difference between white-light interferometry, light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The investigations have been conducted with merino wool with mean diameters of 17, 20, 24 and 31 µm, mohair as well as cashmere from China, Mongolia and Iran...|$|E

Felting can be an adverse attribute as a consequence of dimensional shrinkage during laundering. As there is little objective information regarding the feltability of rare <b>animal</b> <b>fibres</b> or the factors which may affect felting three investigations were undertaken. A survey (n = 114) of the feltability of cashmere from different origins of production, cashgora, quivet, camel hair, llama, guanaco, bison wool, cow fibre and yak wool quantified the large variation between and within these fibre types. Cashmere from some origins and cashgora produced higher feltball density than the other fibres. Different nutritional management of cashmere goats (n = 35) showed that cashmere grown by poorly fed goats had a lower propensity to felt compared with cashmere grown by better fed goats. A consequence of the progressive blending of cashmere (n = 27) with a low propensity to felt superfine wool (high fibre curvature) increased the propensity of the blend to felt, but when the same cashmere was blended with low curvature superfine wool, there was little or no effect on feltability. The mechanisms which lead to variance in feltability of these fibres were quantified with multiple regression modelling. The mechanisms were similar to those reported for wools, namely variations in the resistance to compression, fibre curvature and mean fibre diameter, with likely effects of fibre crimp form.

40|$|As wild felids are obligate carnivores, it {{is likely}} that poorly enzymatically {{digestible}} animal tissues determine hindgut fermentation, instead of plant fibre. Therefore, faecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA, including branched-chain fatty acids, BCFA), indole and phenol were evaluated in 14 captive cheetahs, fed two different diets differing in proportion of poorly enzymatically digestible animal tissue. Using a cross-over design, the cheetahs were fed exclusively whole rabbit or supplemented beef for 1 month each. Feeding whole rabbit decreased faecal propionic (p < 0. 001) and butyric (p = 0. 013) acid concentrations, yet total SCFA was unaltered (p = 0. 146). Also, a remarkably higher acetic acid to propionic acid ratio (p = 0. 013) was present when fed whole rabbit. Total BCFA (p = 0. 011) and putrefactive indole (p = 0. 004) and phenol (p = 0. 002) were lower when fed whole rabbit. Additionally, serum indoxyl sulphate, a toxic metabolite of indole, was analysed and showed a quadratic decrease (p = 0. 050) when fed whole rabbit. The divergent SCFA ratios and the decrease in putrefaction when fed whole rabbit could be caused by the presence of undigested tissue, such as skin, bone and cartilage, that might have fibre-like functions.
