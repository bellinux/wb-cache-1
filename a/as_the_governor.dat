Under Rosas's rule, many intellectuals fled either to Chile, as did Sarmiento, or to Uruguay, as Sarmiento himself notes.|$|E

5|$|In 1017, Maymandi and Mahmud {{agreed to}} invade Khwarazm, then under native Iranian Ma'munid dynasty.

In the same year, the Ghaznavid army deposed the Ma'munid ruler Abu'l-Harith Muhammad, and Altun Tash was appointed <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> of the region.|$|E

5|$|On May 13, 1800, President John Adams {{appointed}} Harrison <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> of {{the newly}} established Indiana Territory, based on his ties {{to the west and}} seemingly neutral political stances.

5|$|Parliament then {{appointed}} Thomas Dickenson, {{the local}} mayor, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> of Clifford's Tower.

Oliver Cromwell visited Clifford's Tower in 1650, and received a salute from the guns stationed on top of it. The cost of the garrison was levied on the city of York.|$|E

It was not announced until 18 August 1842, following Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II's ratifying the governorship, and requiring Brooke to pay an annual sum of $2,500 to the Sultan. Since that time, Kuching became the seat of the Brooke government.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. If both the offices governor and lieutenant governor are vacant, the line of succession moves down through the {{senior members of the}} state senate and state house of representatives of the same party <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor.</b> The lieutenant governor was elected separately from the governor until a 1968 amendment to the constitution made it so that they are elected on the same ticket.|$|E
5|$|The 1776 {{constitution}} {{provided that}} the vice-president of the Legislative Council would act as governor (who {{was president of the}} Council) should that office be vacant. The 1844 constitution placed the president of the Senate first in the line of succession, as did the subsequent 1947 constitution. A constitutional amendment in 2006 created the office of lieutenant governor, to be elected on the same ticket for the same term <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor,</b> and if the office of governor is vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. This office was first filled in 2010.|$|E

5|$|The Rhodesian Prime Minister {{acted as}} Head of His or Her Majesty's Rhodesian Government, under the largely {{symbolic}} supervision of a British colonial Governor, until Rhodesia issued its unrecognised Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965. British-appointed figures such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> were thereafter ignored by Salisbury. The unrecognised state's system of government, however, remained otherwise unchanged, {{right down to}} its declared loyalty to Elizabeth II, which Britain did not acknowledge. This situation remained until March 1970, when Rhodesia adopted a republican system of government. In republican Rhodesia, the Prime Minister instead nominally reported to the President.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} contained barracks, granaries, headquarters, military baths, and {{an unusual}} elliptical building which {{had it been}} finished may have been intended to act <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> of Britain's headquarters. Several factors including {{the uniqueness of the}} elliptical building, the method of construction, and the unusual size of the fortress– 20% larger than other Roman fortresses in Britain– suggest that it may have been intended as the base for a potential invasion of Ireland, and perhaps eventually to become the capital of the unified British Isles under Rome.|$|E
5|$|The state {{constitution}} has provided since 1777 {{for the election}} of a lieutenant governor, who is also ex officio president of the state senate, to the same term (keeping the same term lengths <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> throughout all the constitutional revisions). Originally, in the event of the death, resignation or impeachment of the governor, the lieutenant governor would become acting governor {{until the end of the}} yearly legislative term, the office being filled in a special election, if there was a remainder of the term. Since the 1821 constitution, the lieutenant governor explicitly becomes governor upon such vacancy in the office and serves for the entire remainder of the term. Should the office of lieutenant governor become vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate performs all the duties of the lieutenant governor until the vacancy is filled either at the next gubernatorial election or by appointment. Likewise, should both offices become vacant at the same time, the president pro tempore acts as governor, with the office of lieutenant governor remaining vacant. Should the presidency pro tempore be vacant too, or the incumbent unable to fulfill the duties, the speaker of the assembly is next in the line of succession. The lieutenant governor is elected on the same ticket <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor,</b> since 1954 with a single joint vote cast for both offices, but is nominated separately.|$|E
