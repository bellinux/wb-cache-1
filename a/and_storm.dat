30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} geomagnetic disturbances <b>and</b> <b>storms</b> on large-scale ionospheric variations, the GIMs obtained during the geomagnetic quiet periods are employed for analysis. First, although the ionospheric temporal variations are affected by geomagnetic disturbances <b>and</b> <b>storms,</b> those influences are negligible in our analysis. This is because geomagnetic disturbances <b>and</b> <b>storms</b> {{do not have a}} significant impact on long-term large-scale variations in the ionosphere. Specifically, the duration of geomagnetic disturbances <b>and</b> <b>storms</b> tends to range from a few minutes to tens of hours (Xu 2009), which is short-term compared to our 3 -year data length. That is, the time scale of the ionospheric variation caused by the geomagnetic disturbance or storm is short-term compared to 3 years, and the tensor rank- 1 decomposition only extracts long-term and large-scale ionospheric variations. Hence, the geomagnetic disturbances <b>and</b> <b>storms</b> would make little difference in the long-term ionospheric variations obtained by the tensor rank- 1 decomposition.|$|R

5|$|August 23, 1933– A {{tropical}} storm passes {{to the west}} of the state, causing moderate damage along the coastline from high waves <b>and</b> <b>storm</b> surge. Offshore, about 100boats were destroyed, causing numerous casualties.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{comparatively}} {{light in}} Louisiana. Heavy rains <b>and</b> <b>storm</b> surge inundated marshes, resulting {{in hundreds of}} reported cattle drownings. Cotton crops from Grand Chenier, Louisiana to Sabine Pass was destroyed by the rains and wind. Two deaths in Louisiana were reported in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its close}} {{proximity}} to islands along its path, Dovi caused only minimal damage. Oceanic swells <b>and</b> <b>storm</b> surge were felt in some coastal areas. Strong winds were reported in the southern Cook Islands and Niue. Damage to banana plantations on Palmerston Island was reported, but Dovi caused no fatalities.|$|E

5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage <b>and</b> <b>storm</b> runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E

Theunens pointed out that civilian property and infrastructure at less risk in the aftermath of Operation Mistral 2, as Gotovina had issued much more strict orders in that respect, establishing companies specifically tasked with security and imposing a curfew in Jajce. The HV and the HVO sustained losses of 74 killed and 226 wounded in the operation.|$|E

The second involved Moore distracting the referee, at which time Rhino made his return from an injury and entered the ring to perform his signature Gore maneuver on Storm, giving Young the victory at seven minutes and forty-nine seconds to retain the TNA World Beer Drinking Championship.|$|E
