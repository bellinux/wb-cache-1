Olivia and Peter struggle with locating Hoffman before Walter and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) arrive. Walter uses a fogger to distribute his own chemical agent, this time specific to Hoffman, and soon the man is found dying. As the team regroups, Walter fully admits to killing Hoffman, <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> itself, but Broyles (Lance Reddick) decides to let Walter go. Later, Peter {{has been able to}} recover the rest of his grandfather's work and returns it to Walter; Walter then goes through the files, finding an old photo of his father and Hoffman working together.|$|E

5|$|Only a {{week after}} being {{appointed}} by Harrison, Crittenden was dispatched to New York to mediate tensions with Great Britain over {{the sinking of the}} steamboat Caroline by a group of Canadian militia, who were attempting to suppress a rebellion in Canada. In this diplomatic endeavor, Crittenden was acting separately from his official duties as attorney general. He spoke with New York Governor William H. Seward and secured his promise to pardon Alexander McLeod, who had seized and burned the Caroline, if he were convicted of <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> New York. Ultimately, McLeod was acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Republikflucht became <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> 1957, {{punishable}} by heavy fines {{and up to}} three years' imprisonment. Any act associated with an escape attempt– including helping an escapee– was subject to this legislation. Those {{caught in the act}} were often tried for espionage as well and given proportionately harsher sentences. More than 75,000people– an average of more than seven people a day– were imprisoned for attempting to escape across the border, serving an average of one to two years' imprisonment. Border guards who attempted to escape were treated much more harshly and were on average imprisoned for five years.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{represents}} a Muslim-American who was detained but never accused of <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, {{a civil suit}} against former Attorney General John Ashcroft. In January 2010, the American military released the names of 645 detainees held at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan, modifying its long-held position against publicizing such information. This list was prompted by a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed in September 2009 by the ACLU, whose lawyers had also requested detailed information about conditions, rules and regulations.|$|E

5|$|According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, {{the themes}} of {{alienation}} and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading the Kafka work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka's surrealist humour {{may have been an}} inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b> <b>In</b> Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.|$|E
5|$|Doom and his toon henchmen {{discover}} Roger, {{but he and}} Valiant escape with Benny, an anthropomorphic taxicab. They flee to a theater, where Valiant {{explains to}} Roger that a toon killed Teddy when they were investigating <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> Toontown. As they leave with Dolores, Valiant sees a newsreel detailing the sale of Maroon Cartoons to Cloverleaf, a mysterious corporation that bought the city's trolley network shortly before Acme's murder. Valiant goes to the studio to confront Maroon, leaving Roger to guard outside, but Jessica knocks Roger out and puts him in the trunk. Maroon tells Valiant that he blackmailed Acme into selling his company {{so that he could}} then sell the studio, but is killed before he can explain the consequences of the missing will. Valiant spots Jessica fleeing the scene and, assuming she is the culprit, follows her into Toontown. Jessica reveals that Doom killed Acme and Maroon and that the former had given her his will for safe-keeping, but she discovered that the will was blank. She and Valiant are soon captured by Doom and the weasels.|$|E

5|$|In May 1937, the Committee noted two {{attacks on}} the patrol's ships in the Balearic islands by Spanish Republican Air Force aircraft, the first on the Italian cruiser Barletta and the second on German pocket {{battleship}} Deutschland. It iterated calls for the withdrawal of volunteers from Spain, condemned the bombing of open towns, and showed approval of humanitarian work. Germany and Italy said they would withdrawn from the Committee, and from the patrols, unless it could be guaranteed {{there would be no}} further attacks. Early June saw the return of Germany and Italy to the committee and patrols. Italian reticence of operations in Spain, however, was dropped. By contrast, it continued to be <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> Germany to mention German operations. Following attacks (attributed to Republicans by Germany, but denied) on the German cruiser Leipzig on 15 and 18 June, Germany and Italy once again withdrew from patrols, but not from the Committee. This prompted the Portuguese government to remove British observers on the SpainPortugal border.|$|E
25|$|Adultery is <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> Taiwan and the Philippines. It was <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> Japan until 1947 {{and until}} 2015, in South Korea. In 2015, South Korea's Constitutional Court {{overturned}} the country's law against adultery. Previously, adultery was criminalized in 1953, and violators {{were subject to}} 2 years in prison, {{with the aim of}} protecting women from divorce. The law was overturned because the court found that adultery is a private matter which the state should not intervened in. Adultery is not <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> Mainland China, but is a ground for divorce.|$|E
