500|$|Throughout his term, Scott was {{dogged by}} rumors of heavy {{drinking}} and {{frequent use of}} profanity. On one occasion, an unnamed individual believed his reputation had been injured by something Scott had said and challenged him to a duel. He ignored the challenge, after which the challenger threatened to expose him as a coward. Scott {{was supposed to have}} replied, [...] "Post and be damned; but if you do, you will only post yourself <b>a</b> <b>damned</b> liar, and everybody else will say so." [...] On another occasion, after reviewing a speech written for him by Bledsoe, the governor was said to have remarked, [...] "Well, Mr. Bledsoe, I know you think you are <b>a</b> <b>damned</b> sight smarter than I am, and so you are in many respects; but this message as it is now, won't do at all; I'll be damned if it will." [...] When Bledsoe asked what was wrong with the speech, he reportedly replied, [...] "Why, damn it to hell, why don't you put a good solemn prayer at the end of it, and talk about Providence, and the protection of Heaven, and all that?" [...] After the governor campaigned for Humphrey Marshall's opponent in the 1809 legislative elections, Marshall published an article in the Western World newspaper that accused him of appearing in front of the court house drunk on election day.|$|E

500|$|The {{day after}} being shot, the dying Goebel {{was sworn in}} as governor. In his only act, Goebel signed a {{proclamation}} to dissolve the militia called up by Taylor, which was ignored by the militia's Republican commander. Despite the care of 18 physicians, Goebel died the afternoon of February 3, 1900. Journalists recalled his last words as [...] "Tell my friends to be brave, fearless, and loyal to the common people." [...] Skeptic Irvin S. Cobb uncovered another story from some in the room at the time. On having eaten his last meal, the governor supposedly remarked [...] "Doc, that was <b>a</b> <b>damned</b> bad oyster." [...] In respect of Goebel's displeasure with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, the governor's body was transported not by the L direct line, but circuitously from his hometown of Covington north across the Ohio River to Cincinnati, and then south to Frankfort on the Queen and Crescent Railroad.|$|E

He {{would have preferred to}} vote for the sitting vice president, Hannibal Hamlin, as Lincoln's running mate in 1864, but his delegation voted to cast the state's ballots for the administration's favored candidate, Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat who had been a Tennessee senator and elected governor. [...] Stevens was disgusted at Johnson's nomination, complaining, [...] "can't you get a candidate for Vice-President without going down into <b>a</b> <b>damned</b> rebel province for one?" [...] Stevens campaigned for the Lincoln-Johnson ticket; it was elected, as was Stevens for another term in the House. When in January 1865 Congress learned that Lincoln had attempted peace talks with Confederate leaders, an outraged Stevens declared that if the American electorate could vote again, they would elect General Benjamin Butler instead of Lincoln.|$|E
500|$|Model, {{along with}} all the other commanders involved, {{believed}} this aim was unachievable given the resources available to the Wehrmacht on the West Front at this late point in the war. His first reaction to the plan was caustic in the extreme: [...] "This plan hasn't got <b>a</b> <b>damned</b> leg to stand on." [...] At the same time, both he and Rundstedt felt that the purely defensive posture as had been adopted since retirement from Normandy could only delay Germany's defeat, not prevent it. Thus, he prepared Operation Herbstnebel, a less ambitious attack that did not aim to cross the Meuse, but would still, if successful, have inflicted a severe setback on the Western Allied Army groups now bearing down on the Franco-German border. A similar plan had been developed by Rundstedt at OB West, and the two field marshals combined their idea to present a joint [...] "small solution" [...] to Hitler. Hitler however rejected this compromise, and the [...] "big solution" [...] of aiming for Antwerp was ordered.|$|E
500|$|On March 3, 1847, Pierce was {{promoted}} to brigadier general, and took command of a brigade of reinforcements for General Scott's army, with Ransom succeeding to command of the regiment. Needing time to assemble his brigade, Pierce reached the already-seized port of Vera Cruz in late June, where he prepared a march of 2,500 men accompanying supplies to take to Scott. The three-week journey inland was perilous, and the men fought off several attacks before joining with Scott's army in early August, {{in time for the}} Battle of Contreras. The battle was disastrous for Pierce: his horse was suddenly startled during a charge, knocking him groin-first against his saddle. The horse then tripped into a crevice and fell, pinning Pierce underneath and leaving him with a debilitating knee injury. The incident made it look like he had fainted, causing one soldier to call for someone else to take command, [...] "General Pierce is <b>a</b> <b>damned</b> coward." [...] Pierce returned for the following day's action, but again injured his knee, forcing him to hobble after his men, {{and by the time he}} caught up, the battle had mostly been won.|$|E

500|$|The Rhoads' letter created one of {{the first}} crises for James Beverley, newly {{appointed}} as the acting Governor of Puerto Rico. He said the letter was a [...] "confession of murder" [...] and [...] "a libel against the people of Puerto Rico", and ordered an investigation, one of his first acts. Beverley said of Rhoads that [...] "he was just <b>a</b> <b>damned</b> fool, ... a good doctor, but not very strong mentally on anything else." [...] Rhoads, already back in New York, released an official response to the media and the governor. He insisted that he was joking in his letter, which was intended to be confidential, calling it a [...] "fantastic and playful composition written entirely for my own diversion and intended as a parody on supposed attitudes of some American minds in Porto Rico," [...] explaining that nothing [...] "was ever intended to mean other than the opposite of what was stated." [...] Rhoads offered to return to clear things up, but never did. The governor's inquiry concluded that Rhoads did not commit the acts included in his letter, nor any other crimes.|$|E
500|$|Other early {{references}} to pasties include a 13th-century charter that was granted by Henry III (1207–1272) {{to the town}} of Great Yarmouth. The town is bound to send to the sheriffs of Norwich every year one hundred herrings, baked in twenty four pasties, which the sheriffs are to deliver to the lord of the manor of East Carlton who is then to convey them to the King. Around the same time, 13th-century chronicler Matthew Paris wrote of the monks of St Albans Abbey [...] "according to their custom, lived upon pasties of flesh-meat". A total of 5,500 venison pasties were served at the installation feast of George Neville, archbishop of York and chancellor of England in 1465. They were even eaten by royalty, as a letter from a baker to Henry VIII's third wife, Jane Seymour (1508–1537) confirms: [...] "...hope this pasty reaches you in better condition than the last one..." [...] In his diaries written in the mid-17th century, Samuel Pepys makes several {{references to}} his consumption of pasties, for instance [...] "dined at Sir W. Pen’s ... on <b>a</b> <b>damned</b> venison pasty, that stunk like a devil.", but after this period {{the use of the word}} outside Cornwall declined.|$|E
500|$|From late 1910 {{to early}} 1912, Cerna {{was at the}} University of Leipzig, where he {{attended}} courses held by the philosophers and psychologists Wilhelm Wundt, Eduard Spranger and Hans Volkelt. Wundt left an enduring impression on his Romanian student. In a letter home, Cerna described his modest appearance, which he claimed recalled that of [...] "decrepit" [...] Orthodox members of the Romanian Jewish community, adding: [...] "But I do love this decrepit exterior beyond measure..." [...] Volkelt guided Cerna's research in the scientific field, and coordinated his PhD thesis of 1913, Die Gedankenlyrik (German for [...] "Contemplative Poetry"). According to Călinescu, Cerna's work stated the primacy of [...] "natural ideas" [...] over reasoning, and concluded that [...] "ideas have the purpose of signaling the problematic tensions of the soul." [...] Zarifopol wrote that Cerna was upset over having himself parted with writing poetry, and came to be preoccupied by Maiorescu's German-language dictum: In der Poesie ist der Gedanke ein verfluchtes Ding ("An idea is <b>a</b> <b>damned</b> thing {{when it comes to}} poetry"). Panait Cerna's first volume of collected poetry was published at home in 1910, and, two years later, resulted in the author being made a co-recipient of the Romanian Academy's Vasile Adamachi Award. Some of his new poems were still being published by Convorbiri Literare in 1911.|$|E

500|$|Matt LeMay, {{reviewing}} Mwng on {{its initial}} release for Pitchfork, described the album as being not as [...] "fully realised or inventive" [...] as 1999's Guerrilla and said that, although the record highlights Rhys's talents for songwriting, {{the lack of}} any [...] "electronic wizardry" [...] from keyboard player Ciaran is disappointing. LeMay went on to state, however, that Mwng is [...] "still [...] <b>a</b> <b>damned</b> enjoyable listen", and said that the record [...] "couples cultural pride with unforgettable melodies in a way few bands have ever attempted". On the album's re-release in 2005, Pitchfork writer Marc Hogan stated that Mwng's [...] "sinuous pop melodies and organic arrangements" [...] make for an [...] "exciting discovery", despite the lack of the band's [...] "usual studio wizardry". Q said that, while tracks such as [...] "Ymaelodi Â'r Ymylon" [...] and [...] "Y Gwyneb Iau" [...] are [...] "strangely charming, chiming pop music with a twist", Mwng is hampered by its [...] "bare-boned production". Mojo, however, described the album as a [...] "sensuous sonic journey" [...] with an [...] "organic, woody, mystical atmosphere" [...] that compares favourably with the overly-produced sounds of the band's previous records. The magazine went on to suggest the album's only flaw is that it [...] "manages to lose its way for a while [...] in the middle", thanks to the poor sequencing of its tracks.|$|E
500|$|In 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who {{had been}} {{overseeing}} the Paris installation, was {{brought back to the}} US to manage [...] the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the US as well. In June 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States. He began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 [...] "field engineers" [...] struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city. As in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators. Historian W. Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder, Thomas Alva Edison, only a couple of times. One of those times was noted in Tesla's autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner SS Oregon, he ran into Batchelor and Edison who made a quip about their [...] "Parisian" [...] being out all night. After Tesla told them he had been up all night fixing the Oregon Edison commented to Batchelor that [...] "this is <b>a</b> <b>damned</b> good man." [...] One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp–based street lighting system. Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose contracts in cities that wanted street lighting as well. Tesla's designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison cut with an arc lighting company.|$|E
500|$|Astaire's first {{seduction}} of Rogers in [...] "Isn't This a Lovely Day," [...] falls foul of the mistaken-identity {{theme of}} the plot, so he makes a second attempt, encouraged by Broderick, in the number [...] "Cheek to Cheek". As in [...] "No Strings," [...] the song emerges from Astaire's mid-sentence as he dances with the hesitant Rogers on a crowded floor. Berlin wrote the words and music to this enduring classic in one day, and, at 72 measures, it is the longest song he ever wrote. He was very appreciative of Astaire's treatment of the song: [...] "The melody keeps going up and up. He crept up there. It didn't make <b>a</b> <b>damned</b> bit of difference. He made it." [...] As he navigates through this difficult material, Rogers looks attracted and receptive and, {{at the end of}} the song, they dance cheek to cheek across a bridge to a deserted ballroom area nearby. According to Mueller's analysis, the duet that follows – easily the most famous of all the Astaire-Rogers partnered dances – reflects the complexity of the emotional situation in which the pair find themselves. No longer flirting, as in [...] "Isn't This a Lovely Day?," [...] the pair are now in love. But Rogers feels guilty and deceived and would prefer to avoid Astaire's advances – in effect, fall out of love with him. Therefore, Astaire's purpose here is to make her put aside her misgivings (which are a mystery to him) and surrender completely to him. The choreographic device introduced to reflect the progress of this seduction is the supported backbend, exploiting Rogers' exceptionally flexible back. The main dance begins with the first of two brief passages which reuse the device of sequential imitation introduced in [...] "Isn't This a Lovely Day?". The pair spin and lean, dodging back and forth past each other before moving into a standard ballroom position where the first hints of the supported backbend are introduced. The first backbend occurs at the end of a sequence where Astaire sends Rogers into a spin, collects her upstage and maneuvers her into a linked-arm stroll forward, repeats the spin but this time encircles her while she turns and then takes her in his arms. As the music becomes more energetic, the dancers flow across the floor and Rogers, moving against the music, suddenly falls into a deeper backbend, which is then repeated, only deeper still. The music now transitions to a quiet recapitulation of the main melody during which the pair engage in a muted and tender partnering, and here the second passage involving sequential imitation appears. With the music reaching its grand climax Astaire and Rogers rush toward the camera, then away in a series of bold, dramatic manoeuvers culminating in three ballroom lifts which showcase Rogers' dress before abruptly coming to a halt in a final, deepest backbend, maintained as the music approaches its closing bars. They rise, and after a couple of turns dancing cheek to cheek for the first time since the dance began, come to rest next to a wall. Rogers, having conducted the dance in a state of dreamlike abandon now glances uneasily at Astaire before walking away, as if reminded that their relationship cannot proceed.|$|E
