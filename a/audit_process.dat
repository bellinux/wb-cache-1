30|$|Once the CU’s {{authentication}} message matches {{with the}} aggregated authenticator of the CSP, the CU is {{considered as a}} legitimate client within the CSP’s domain. The TPA can then obtain the secret key from the CSP for each authentication message of the CU to initiate the <b>auditing</b> <b>process.</b> Specifically, the TPA requires session keys for comparison of each audit. Thus, it will be harder for the TPA to expose the outsourced data file ‘φ’ of a CU once the <b>auditing</b> <b>process</b> is completed. If the TPA attempts to exploit the outsourced data file of a CU after the <b>auditing</b> <b>process,</b> it needs a new session key that is not assigned to the TPA by the CU. However, the TPA may experience the problem because the <b>auditing</b> <b>process</b> will be limited if auditing is required more than one time.|$|R

2500|$|On 14 April 2013, Nicolas Maduro won {{the presidential}} {{election}} with 50.6% of the vote, ahead of the 49.1% of candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski, surprisingly close compared to previous polls. Opposition leaders made accusations of fraud shortly after the election and Capriles {{refused to accept the}} results, alleging that voters had been coerced to vote for Maduro and claiming election irregularities. The National Electoral Council (CNE), which conducted a post-election audit of a random selection of 54% of the votes, comparing electronic records with paper ballots, claimed to find nothing suspicious. Capriles initially called for an audit of the remaining 46% of the votes, asserting that this would show that he had won the election. The CNE agreed to carry out an audit, and planned to do so in May. Later Capriles changed his mind, adding demands for a full audit of the electoral registry, and calling the <b>audit</b> <b>process</b> “a joke”. Before the government agreed to a full audit of the vote, there were public protests by opponents of Maduro. The crowds were ultimately dispersed by National Guard members using tear gas and rubber bullets. President Maduro responded to the protests by saying, “If you want to try to oust us through a coup, the people and the armed forces will be waiting for you.” [...] The clashes resulted in 7 people killed and dozens injured. President Maduro described the protests as a [...] "coup" [...] attempt, and blamed the United States for them. Finally, Capriles told protesters to stop and not play the [...] "government's game," [...] so {{there would be no more}} deaths. On 12 June 2013 the results of the partial audit were announced. The CNE certified the initial results and confirmed Maduro's electoral victory.|$|E
