5|$|A major 18-month {{redevelopment}} of {{the square}} led by W.S. Atkins with Foster and Partners as sub-consultants was completed in 2003. The work involved closing the eastbound road along the north side and diverting traffic <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> three sides {{of the square}}, demolishing the central section of the northern retaining wall and inserting a wide set of steps to the pedestrianised terrace {{in front of the}} National Gallery. The construction includes two lifts for disabled access, public toilets and a café. Access between the square and the gallery had been by two crossings at the northeast and northwest corners.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks later}} a hard-hat diver, sent down {{to recover the}} gold and other valuables, found the bodies of two women {{at the foot of}} the saloon staircase, one with her arm <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> The diver tried to reach them to take a lock of hair or some other {{personal}} item that could be identified by their loved ones, but the restriction of the air line made it impossible. The gold in the Captain's cabin was recovered after much difficulty. While recovering the gold, several sharks that were caught near the wreck were found to contain human bones, remains and jewellery.|$|E

25|$|The {{first attempt}} to {{represent}} an orientation is attributed to Leonhard Euler. He imagined three reference frames that could rotate one <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> and realized that by starting with a fixed reference frame and performing three rotations, he could get any other reference frame in the space (using two rotations to fix the vertical axis and other to fix the other two axes). The values of these three rotations are called Euler angles.|$|E

25|$|If we {{take the}} one-parameter {{subgroup}} generated by any loxodromic Möbius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the same two points. All other points flow along a certain family of curves, away from the first fixed point and toward the second fixed point. Unlike the hyperbolic case, these curves are not circular arcs, but certain curves which under stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane appear as spiral curves which twist counterclockwise infinitely often around one fixed point and twist clockwise infinitely often <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> fixed point. In general, the two fixed points may be any two distinct points on the Riemann sphere.|$|E

Four tzitzyot are passed through each hole (11:12-13), and the two groups of four ends are double-knotted to each other {{at the edge of the}} garment near the hole (11:14,15). One of the four tzitzit is made longer than the others (11:4); the long end of that one is wound <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> seven ends and double-knotted; this is done repeatedly so as to make a total of five double knots separated by four sections of winding, with a total length of at least four inches, leaving free-hanging ends that are twice that long (11:14).|$|E
25|$|The wooden {{grandstand}} was demolished {{and replaced}} by a much larger and more modern structure {{at a cost of}} £12,000, while concrete terracing with crush barriers were added <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> three sides of the ground. A pitched roof was erected along the main entrance at the Devonport End of the ground, to provide cover for supporters using that terrace. The new grandstand incorporated players changing rooms and club offices. Many of these facilities were built with funds provided by the official supporters club. By the 1930s the ground was regularly hosting crowds in excess of 20,000 and on 10 October 1936 the record attendance was set. A crowd of 43,596 were in attendance to watch the club play out a 2–2 draw with Aston Villa in the Football League Second Division. The ground continued to host Second Division football until the outbreak of war in 1939.|$|E
25|$|These are basal, {{emerging}} from the bulb initially enclosed in a tubular membranous sheath of cataphylls. These are generally two (sometimes three) and linear, strap-shaped or oblanceolate. Vernation, {{the arrangement of the}} emerging leaves relative to each other, varies between species. These may be applanate (flat), supervolute (conduplicate) or explicative (pleated). In applanate vernation the two leaf blades are pressed flat to each other within the bud and as they emerge; explicative leaves are also pressed flat against each other, but the edges of the leaves are folded back (externally recurved) or sometimes rolled; in supervolute plants one leaf is tightly clasped <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> within the bud and generally remains {{at the point where the}} leaves emerge from the soil (for illustration, see Stearn and Davis). In the past, this feature has been used to distinguish between species and to determine the parentage of hybrids but has been shown to be homoplasious, and not useful in this regard.|$|E

500|$|The castle {{was built}} on the {{south-east}} corner of Brownsea Island between 1545 and 1547 to protect the entrance of the busy Poole Harbour. The island belonged to the Crown, having been confiscated from Cerne Abbey during the Dissolution of the Monasteries a few years before. It was a conservative design, being a one-storey, square blockhouse, reported in 1552 to be [...] across, able to support guns on its roof and sub-divided into three rooms; the blockhouse was originally intended to have been two storeys in height, but this was not achieved.

However, the party soon became divided between radicals and more conciliatory groups. Joseph Nāwahī and White became the leaders of the factions of the Liberals loyal to the queen against the more radical members such as John E. Bush and Robert William Wilcox, who were advocating for drastic changes such as increased power for the people and a republican form of government. Newspaper accounts noted that, during a meeting of Hui Kālaiʻāina on December 4, 1892, White reportedly said that he had [...] "always abhorred the idea of a republic".|$|E

500|$|Sarus cranes have loud trumpeting calls. These calls are, as {{in other}} cranes, {{produced}} by the elongated trachea that form coils within the sternal region. Pairs may indulge in spectacular displays of calling in unison and posturing. These include [...] "dancing" [...] movements that are performed both during and outside the breeding season and involve a short series of jumping and bowing movements made {{as one of the}} pair circles <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Dancing may also be a displacement activity when the nest or young are threatened. The cranes breed mainly during the monsoons in India (from July to October although there may be a second brood), and there are records of breeding in all the months. They build large nests, platforms made of reeds and vegetation in wet marshes or paddy fields. The nest is constructed within shallow water by piling up rushes, straw, grasses with their roots and mud so that the platform rises above the level of the water to form a little island. The nest is unconcealed and conspicuous, being visible from afar, and defended fiercely by the pair.|$|E

500|$|Chandler and Phoebe had {{originally}} been written as more secondary characters who were just there to provide humor <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> four; Matthew Perry described Chandler in the pilot script as [...] "an observer of other people's lives". They had {{become part of the}} core group by the time casting concluded. Crane believed that the part of Chandler, described in the character breakdown as [...] "a droll, dry guy", would be the easiest to cast, though it proved more difficult than he initially hoped. Perry had previously worked with Kauffman and Crane on an episode of Dream On, and requested an audition when he identified with the character. He was turned down due to his involvement as a cast member in LAX 2194, a television pilot about airport baggage handlers in the future. After the producers of Friends saw LAX 2194, it became clear to them {{that it would not be}} picked up for a series, and Perry was granted an audition. He read for the role near the end of the casting period and got it in under a week. Before Perry was cast, Craig Bierko was first choice for the role. Bierko was a friend of Perry's, and Perry coached him for his audition to help him get to know what the Chandler character was like. Jon Cryer had also auditioned for the part. He was doing a play in London and read for a British casting director, though his audition tape did not arrive at Warner Bros. in time for him to be considered.|$|E

500|$|Success {{finally came}} in the 2001–02 season. Arsenal regained the league, beating Manchester United at Old Trafford in the {{penultimate}} {{game of the season}} to complete the club's second double under Wenger; Arsenal defeated Chelsea 2–0 to win the FA Cup four days prior. Bergkamp played in 33 league matches, setting up 15 goals, one of which was against Juventus in the second group stage of the Champions League. Holding off two markers, he twisted and turned before feeding the ball to Freddie Ljungberg in the penalty box to score. Bergkamp headed in the winner against Liverpool in a FA Cup fourth-round tie on 27 January 2002, but was shown a red card for a two-footed lunge on defender Jamie Carragher, who himself was sent off for throwing a coin into the crowd. He was subsequently banned for three matches (two league, one FA Cup round). Bergkamp appealed for his ban, but was unsuccessful. He made his return against Newcastle United on 3 March 2002. Early in the match, Arsenal midfielder Robert Pirès played a low pass from the left flank to Bergkamp in the edge of the opponent area with his back to goal. Under pressure from his marker Nikos Dabizas, Bergkamp controlled the ball with one flick and went <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side before placing the ball precisely into the bottom right-hand corner to score. Wenger described the goal as [...] "unbelievable", adding [...] "It was not only a magnificent goal but a very important one – I enjoyed it a lot". Bergkamp featured in nine out of the last ten league games, forming a productive partnership with Ljungberg.|$|E
