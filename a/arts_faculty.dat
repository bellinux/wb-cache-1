25|$|The {{university}} {{underwent a}} period of considerable expansion in the 1960s. Between 1963 and 1968, a period {{when the number of}} students at Exeter almost doubled, no fewer than ten major buildings were completed on the Streatham estate as well as halls of residence for around 1,000 students. These included homes for the Chemistry and Physics departments, the Newman, Laver and Engineering Buildings and Streatham Court. Queen's Building had been opened for the <b>Arts</b> <b>Faculty</b> in 1959 and the Amory Building, housing Law and Social Sciences, followed in 1974. In the following two decades, considerable investment was made in developing new self-catering accommodation for students.|$|E
25|$|World War II posed {{a crisis}} to the {{institution}} {{similar to that of}} the Civil War, as male students began enlisting in the service within a month of Pearl Harbor, and soon only a handful remained on campus. Through an arrangement with the Navy Department, the college survived by becoming a U.S. Naval Flight Preparatory School, and later offered a V-5 Navy Academic Refresher Unit program for officers. Courses were taught by Monmouth’s liberal <b>arts</b> <b>faculty.</b> The Navy later adopted portions of Monmouth's curriculum for training programs nationwide. More than 2,000 Navy men went through Monmouth College, a number of whom would re-enroll at the college after the war funded by the G.I. Bill.|$|E

Glendon is the only university-level institution in central Southern Ontario that offers university courses in both French and English. Further, it is the only University Campus in Ontario that requires students to take courses in both official languages of Canada. The Campus is made accessible through TTC Routes 124-Sunnybrook and 11-Bayview and a frequent shuttle bus that runs between Glendon and York's Keele Campus. Glendon students are free to take courses and access Libraries and institutional services offered at the Keele campus (and vice versa).|$|E

500|$|Another {{problem was}} that Tempier did not {{identify}} the targets of his condemnation, merely indicating that it was directed against unspecified members of the <b>Arts</b> <b>Faculty</b> in Paris. Siger of Brabant and Boethius of Dacia have been singled out as the most prominent targets of the 1277 censure, even though their names are {{not found in the}} document itself, appearing instead in the rubrics of only two of the many manuscripts that preserve the condemnation. These two scholars were important proponents of the Averroist movement. The ground-breaking study by the historian Roland Hissette has shown that many of the censured propositions appear to have come from Aristotle, from Arab philosophers, or from [...] "the philosophers" [...] (i.e. other Greek philosophers).|$|E
500|$|The Condemnation of 1210 {{was issued}} by the provincial synod of Sens, which {{included}} the Bishop of Paris as a member (at the time Peter of Nemours). The writings {{of a number of}} medieval scholars were condemned, apparently for pantheism, and it was further stated that: [...] "Neither the books of Aristotle on natural philosophy or their commentaries are to be read at Paris in public or secret, and this we forbid under penalty of excommunication." [...] However, this had only local force, and its application was further restricted to the <b>Arts</b> <b>faculty</b> at the University of Paris. Theologians were therefore left free to read the prohibited works, the titles of which were not even specified. [...] Alexander of Aphrodisias was probably among the Aristotelian commentators whose influence was targeted.|$|E
