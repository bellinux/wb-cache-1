500|$|Recording a {{new album}} was, {{according}} to Robert, a [...] "natural progression" [...] after the band began playing together again. [...] "The thing that kind of introduces us back together is all those memories of the songs, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> start playing those songs... it always takes us back to... 18 years now.

500|$|... "Miss Independent" [...] is a R-{{influenced}} pop song. Katherine St Asaph of Popdust {{noted that}} [...] "it’s the closest Kelly Clarkson’s come to R" [...] Clarkson said that Aguilera's rhythmic style heavily influenced the song. She remarked, [...] "You {{can hear a}} lot of her influence in 'Miss Independent', especially the hook. <b>And</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> hear the song, it's constantly in your head. Believe me, I cannot get it out!" [...] Rachell Kipp of the Associated Press wrote that [...] "Miss Independent" [...] "sounds like a half-baked remake of Aguilera's [...] "Dirrty" [...] (2002)" [...] The song has a length of three minutes and 35 seconds and is written in the key of D major, Clarkson's vocal range spans from F3 to F5.|$|E

During the series, Martin was asked how he had learned to run so fast; he replied, [...] "I grew up in Oklahoma, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> start runnin' out there there ain't nothin' to stop you". Longtime major league manager, John McGraw, described Martin's performance as [...] "the greatest individual performance {{in the history of the}} World Series."

500|$|The Independents Andy Gill {{awarded a}} four-out-of-five star rating to Syro {{and called it}} [...] "a {{collection}} primarily concerned with the somatic rather than cerebral sides of Richard James' music, overdosing somewhat on staccato, bouncing synth twangs and jittery drum'n'bass beats." [...] "aisatsana [...] ", Syros closing track, drew comparisons to the works of French composer Erik Satie from both The Independent and Drowned in Sound, whose reviewer Tom Fenwick awarded the album a full 10-out-of-10 rating. Summarising the album, Fenwick said that [...] "Syro sees a master craftsman return with renewed inspiration. And while it might not technically be James' most innovative album, it way [...] well be his best … <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> let the hype drain away—what's revealed is pretty much flawless." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. Häkkinen was delighted with his victory: [...] "This was an incredible win.

The kerbs here are very slippery <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> go over one there is not much you can do. I was lucky to keep going and I was able to chase Michael. But the car got better and better." [...] The driver added that he wanted to review his overtaking manoeuvre to see if Michael Schumacher performed an illegal move. Schumacher said that despite improvements to his car, he was unable to match Häkkinen's overall pace. He added that he experienced no problems running off-line to cool his tyres, and was happy to run behind backmarkers for straight-line speed assistance during the race's closing stages.|$|E

2500|$|The Bruins volleyball {{team had}} an [...] "A" [...] squad and a {{developmental}} squad. A large blue curtain separated the two practice courts. Players were in constant competition {{to stay on}} the [...] "A" [...] squad. Scates used a scoring system for his players during the practices, and their position on the team depended on the points they were scoring in practice. The coaches with the development squad could recommend players to move up, and Scates would check scores and move an [...] "A" [...] court player down. The scoring system allowed the players to know there was nothing personal in the choices being made. John Speraw, a former player and current head coach at UCLA, commented [...] "the way he managed to make objective decisions was to stay fairly separate from the players. It was never personal. <b>And</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> graduated, he enjoyed the relationship that developed with his players." [...] He highly valued competitiveness in a player, and wanted to go into matches with players that hated to lose. UCLA alumnus Karch Kiraly noted a common thread in the players around him at UCLA: [...] "He recruited people that were like I was. We absolutely hated to lose and loved to win, and that's what the Bruins were like. They were a reflection of Al, and Al wanted to win every single match, every single season." ...|$|E

60|$|I was {{indebted to}} Farrar for Mr. Cooke's acquaintance, and this {{obligation}} I have since in vain endeavored to repay. Farrar's profession was forestry: {{a graduate of}} an eastern college, he had gone abroad to study, and had roughed it with the skilled woodsmen of the Black Forest. Mr. Cooke, whom he represented, had large tracts of land in these parts, and Farrar likewise received an income from the state, whose legislature had at last opened its eyes to the timber depredations and had begun to buy up reserves. We had rooms in the same Elizabethan building {{at the corner of}} Main and Superior streets, {{but it was more than}} a year before I got farther than a nod with him. Farrar's nod in itself was a repulsion, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> had seen it you mentally scored him from the list of your possible friends. Besides this freezing exterior he possessed a cutting and cynical tongue, and had but little confidence in the human race. These qualities did not tend to render him popular in a Western town, if indeed they would have recommended him anywhere, and I confess to have thought him a surly enough fellow, being guided by general opinion and superficial observation. Afterwards the town got to know him, and if it did not precisely like him, it respected him, which perhaps is better. And he gained at least a few warm-friends, among whom I deem it an honor to be mentioned.|$|E
