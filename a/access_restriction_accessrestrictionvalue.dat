40|$|Urban freight {{transport}} has many sustainable aspects. It contributes to economic vitality and {{the competitiveness of}} a region. However, the less socially and environmentally friendly effects such as noise, pollutant emissions, and nuisance, are usually the central theme in designing urban {{freight transport}} policies. Restricting policies as time <b>access</b> <b>restrictions</b> and vehicle restrictions gain popularity among Dutch local authorities. More {{than half of the}} municipalities uses time <b>access</b> <b>restrictions.</b> In spite of the popularity of these policy measures, the effects on the distribution of retailers, the environment and the transport costs are not known yet. In this paper we present three case studies of food retailers, in order {{to examine the effects of}} time <b>access</b> <b>restrictions</b> and vehicle weight restrictions. We discuss the impacts on the transport costs and the distribution processes (on the retailer’s side) and the environmental impacts. To find these effects we design five scenarios, in which we vary the length of time <b>access</b> <b>restrictions,</b> the allowed weight of the weight restriction and the number of cities in which these regulations are used. In these scenarios we adapt, based on the likely reaction of the involved food retailers, the distribution activities to fit the regulations. The results show that the vehicle weight restriction as well as the time <b>access</b> <b>restrictions</b> have a negative impact on the retailers’ transport costs. In most cases we see that the policy measures also cause an increase in the pollutant CO 2 emissions that are emitted during the distribution of the goods. The time <b>access</b> <b>restrictions</b> cause a cost-increase that develops more or less convexly, as more stores are affected by this policy measure. The turning point is around 45 % of the stores affected. The weight restriction causes linear cost-increase as more stores are affected. Both policy measures affect especially the roundtrips that combine multiple less than truckload orders for different stores. The policy measures have a different effect on different retailers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The main {{aim of the}} Linked Open Data (LOD) {{project is}} to publish data {{publicly}} without <b>access</b> <b>restriction</b> {{in order to be}} consumed upon Unified Resource Identifier (URI) resolution. The latter provides more description about the resources being represented through the resolvability and discoverability of more others resources. Sometimes, data/resources need to undergo an <b>access</b> <b>restriction</b> to be consumed only on a small scale for keeping its confidentiality. However, while the power of the LOD resides in the resolvability of more URIs related to the resources in hand, a curious question imposes itself: how can we achieve a compromise between URI resolvability and <b>access</b> <b>restriction?</b> This paper discusses how the represented data cam be secured. It illustrates how the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) can be applied to restrict the access to confidential resources of represented data being published using the Linked Data Principles (LDP), while maintaining the resolvability of such restricted resources. This brings out a new era of research related to the counter part of LOD, a research topic called the Linked Closed Data (LCD). A good example to elaborate this compromise question is a case study retrieved from the Cyber Forensics (CF) field where the tangible Chain of Custody (CoC) is represented using the LDP to exploit the resolvability feature of such principles on different resources of the Electronic-CoC (e-CoC). The latter should also obey an <b>access</b> <b>restriction</b> in order to be shared only between role players who published the data and juries who are going to consume it...|$|R

Independently of a specific ontology language or reasoner, we provided a lattice-based framework to assign labels to an ontology’s axioms and consequences.

40|$|Aims: To examine {{existing}} {{evidence on}} the effectiveness of interventions that are designed to prevent the illegal sale of tobacco to young people. The review considers specific sub-questions related to the factors that might influence effectiveness, any differential effects for different sub-populations of youth, and barriers and facilitators to implementation. Methods: A review of studies on the impact of interventions on young people under the age of 18 was conducted. It included interventions that were designed to prevent the illegal sale of tobacco to children and young people. The review was conducted in July 2007, and included 20 papers on <b>access</b> <b>restriction</b> studies. The quality of the papers was assessed and the relevant data was extracted. Results: The evidence obtained from the review indicates that <b>access</b> <b>restriction</b> interventions may produce significant reductions in the rate of illegal tobacco sales to youth. However, lack of enforcement and the ability of youth to acquire cigarettes from social sources may undermine the effectiveness of these interventions. Conclusions: When access interventions are applied in a comprehensive manner, they can affect young people’s access to tobacco. However, further research is required {{to examine the effects of}} <b>access</b> <b>restriction</b> interventions on young people’s smoking behaviour...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impact of the re-introduction of <b>access</b> <b>restrictions</b> to forests in Tanzania, through {{participatory}} forest management (PFM), that have excluded villagers from forests to which they have traditionally, albeit illegally, had access to collect non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Motivated by our fieldwork, and using a spatial-temporal model, we focus on the paths of forest degradation and regeneration and villagers' utility before and after an <b>access</b> <b>restriction</b> is introduced. Our paper illustrates a number of key points for policy makers. First, the benefits of forest conservation tend to be greatest in the first few periods after an <b>access</b> <b>restriction</b> is introduced, after which the overall forest quality often declines. Second, villagers may displace their NTFP collection into more distant forests that may have been completely protected by distance alone before access to a closer forest was restricted. Third, permitting villagers to collect limited amounts of NTFPs for a fee, or alternatively fining villagers caught collecting illegally from the protected forest, and returning the fee or fine revenue to the villagers, can improve both forest quality and villagers' livelihoods.
