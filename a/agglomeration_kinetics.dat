40|$|The {{stability}} of nanoparticle suspensions {{and the details}} of their agglomeration depend on the interactions between particles. We study this relationship in gold nanoparticles stabilized with different alkyl thiols in heptane. Temperature-dependent interactions were inferred from small-angle x-ray scattering, <b>agglomeration</b> <b>kinetics</b> from dynamic light scattering, and agglomerate morphologies from transmission electron microscopy. We find that the particles precipitate at temperatures below the melting temperatures of the dry ligands. Agglomerates grow with rates that depend on the temperature: Around precipitation temperature, globular agglomerates form slowly, while at lower temperatures, fibrilar agglomerates form rapidly. All agglomerates contain random dense packings rather than crystalline superlattices. We conclude that ligand-ligand and ligand-solvent interactions of the individual particles dominate suspension stability and <b>agglomeration</b> <b>kinetics.</b> The microscopic packing is dominated by interactions between the ligands of different nanoparticles...|$|E

This work presents a new application of the technique for the agglomeration of -alumina in water and in n-heptane. The method of determining the kinetic parameters of agglomeration from the initial time-evolution of turbidity is explained. Turbulent flow in the reactor has also been characterised by laser anemometry. From the turbulence intensity, the number of collisions per unit time is calculated and the agglomeration rate can therefore be determined. Good agreement is found between the values obtained respectively from turbidimetric and hydrodynamic measurements. Addition of KOH modifies the zeta potential of alumina in water and influences the <b>agglomeration</b> <b>kinetics.</b> This can also be quantitatively characterised by turbidimetry.

40|$|Preferential {{accumulation}} and <b>agglomeration</b> <b>kinetics</b> of nanoparticles {{suspended in}} an acoustically levitated water droplet under radiative heating has been studied. Particle image velocimetry performed {{to map the}} internal flow field shows a single cell recirculation with increasing strength for decreasing viscosities. Infrared thermography and high speed imaging show details of the heating process for various concentrations of nanosilica droplets. Initial stage of heating is marked by fast vaporization of liquid and sharp temperature rise. Following this stage, aggregation of nanoparticles is seen resulting in various structure formations. At low concentrations, a bowl structure of the droplet is dominant, maintained at a constant temperature. At high concentrations, viscosity of the solution increases, leading to rotation about the levitator axis due to the dominance of centrifugal motion. Such complex fluid motion inside the droplet due to acoustic streaming eventually results {{in the formation of}} a ring structure. This horizontal ring eventually reorients itself due to an imbalance of acoustic forces on the ring, exposing larger area for laser absorption and subsequent sharp temperature rise...|$|E

This paper presents some results obtained by the study of {{wet granulation}} of microcrystalline cellulose powder, MCC (Avicel PH 101) using high-shear mixer granulators. It aims at understanding the effect of physicochemical properties, such as the viscosity and the wettability of a binder solution on solid particles surfaces, on the <b>agglomeration</b> <b>kinetics.</b> The experiments are carried out with various liquids having different surface tensions, viscosities, binder concentrations, etc. (water, aqueous solutions of sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylméthylcellulose or non ionic surfactant oxo-C 10 C 6 at a critical mycell concentration). The effect of the physicochemical properties is evaluated using a modified capillary viscous number, Ca’, which is defined, in this study, by the ratio between the viscous forces (μLU) and the work of adhesion Wa=γL(1 +cosθ). The results show that for Ca ’ < 1, the viscosity of the solution does not significantly affect the granulation process. The dominant forces in the granulation process are the interfacial forces since increasing the work of adhesion enhances the growth kinetics.

40|$|Precipitation of {{gibbsite}} from supersaturated caustic aluminate solutions {{has been}} investigated extensively due to its {{central role in the}} commercial Bayer plant, for extracting the alumina compound from bauxite. The primary focus of Bayer process simulation and optimisation is to help maximise the product recovery and the production of a product crystal size distribution (CSD) that meets the product specification and improves downstream process performance. The product CSD is essentially determined by the nucleation, growth and <b>agglomeration</b> <b>kinetics,</b> which occur simultaneously during the precipitation process. These processes are still poorly understood, owing to the high complexity of their mechanisms and {{of the structure of the}} caustic aluminate solutions. This research focuses on the modelling and kinetics estimation aspects of simulating gibbsite precipitation. Population balance theory was used to derive different laboratory gibbsite precipitator models, and the discretised population balance models of Hounslow, Ryall & Marshall (1988) and Litster, Smit & Hounslow (1995) were employed to solve the resulting partial integro-differential equations. Gibbsite kinetics rates were determined from literature correlation models and also estimated from the CSD data using the, so-called, differential method. Modelling of nonstationary gibbsite precipitation systems showed that error propagated with the precipitation time scale. The main contribution to the observed error was found to be from the uncertainties in the kinetic parameter estimates, which are estimated from experimental data and used in the simulation. This result showed that care is required when simulating the CSD of non-stationary precipitators over longer time scales, and methods that produce precise estimates of the kinetics rates from the experimental data need to be used. Kinetics estimation study from repeated batch gibbsite precipitation data showed that the uncertainty in the experimental data coupled with the error incurred from the kinetic parameter estimation procedure used, resulted in large uncertainties in the kinetics estimates. The influences of the experimental design and the kinetics estimation technique on the accuracy and precision of estimates of the nucleation, growth and <b>agglomeration</b> <b>kinetics</b> for the gibbsite precipitation system were investigated. It was found that the operating conditions have a greater impact on the uncertainties in the estimated kinetics than does the precipitator configuration. The kinetics estimates from the integral method, i. e. non-linear parameter optimisation method, describe the gibbsite precipitation data better than those obtained by the differential method. However, both kinetics estimation techniques incurred significant uncertainties in the kinetics estimates, particularly toward the end of the precipitation runs where the kinetics rates are slow. The uncertainties in the kinetics estimates are strongly correlated to the magnitude of kinetics values and are dependent on the change in total crystal numbers and total crystal volume. Batch gibbsite precipitation data from an inhomogeneously-mixed precipitator were compared to a well-mixed precipitation system operated under the same operating conditions, i. e. supersaturation, seed charge, seed type, mean shear rate and temperature. It was found that the gibbsite agglomeration kinetic estimates were significantly different, and hence, the product CSD, but the gibbsite growth rates were similar. It was also found that a compartmental model approach cannot fully account for the differences in suspension hydrodynamics, and resulted in unsatisfactorily CSD predictions of the inhomogeneously-mixed precipitator. This is attributed to the coupled effects of local energy dissipation rate and solids phase mixing on agglomeration process...|$|E

This paper presents the study of {{wet granulation}} of microcrystalline cellulose powder, MCC (Avicel PH 101) using high-shear mixer granulator. It aims at understanding the effect of operating parameters (impeller rotational speed, liquid binder flow ate) and of physicochemical properties (viscosity, wettability) of a binder solution on solid particles surfaces, on the <b>agglomeration</b> <b>kinetics.</b> The experiments are carried out with water, aqueous solutions of sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylméthylcellulose or a non ionic surfactant oxo-C 10 C 6 at a critical micellar concentration. Concerning the process variables the experimental results show that an optimal interval of impeller speed operation exists ranging from 150 to 200 rpm for granule growth. Below, an uncontrollable agglomerate size and localised over-wetting occur, and above granule breakage occurs. Increasing the liquid binder flow rate reduces the extension of the non growth regime, but does not affect the granule mean size.

40|$|Toxicological {{investigations}} on nanoparticles {{require a}} comprehensive physico-chemical characterization to get useful {{information about the}} powder {{as well as the}} behavior of the suspended nanoparticles in water and physiological media. Therefore, we characterized the often used TiO 2 P 25 and developed procedures to get stable, homogeneous, and well-defined nanoparticle suspensions. A titration of the zeta potential {{as a function of the}} pH yielded the conclusion that the TiO 2 suspension is stable at a pH of 4 or lower. In this region the zeta potential is higher than 30 mV, which guarantees a high stability of the suspended particles. Hence, a stable TiO 2 initial suspension was prepared in 0. 1 mM HCl having a mean particle size of 170 ± 5 nm, which was determined by dynamic light scattering. Furt hermore, the initial suspension was added to different physiological media (0. 9 % NaCl solution, phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], Hanks balanced salt solution [HBSS], Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium [DMEM]) for studying the agglomeration behavior. As a result, the <b>agglomeration</b> <b>kinetics</b> at the same TiO 2 concentration is independent of the used media. Investigations with PBS containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) and DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS revealed that these protein additions inhibit the agglomeration of the particles. Thus, the physiological media contains particles that are stabilized through the steric or electrosteric effect of BSA and of the proteins in FBS, respectively. Consequently, the particles keep their size from the initial suspension. Finally, our procedure demonstra ted on TiO 2 P 25 results in homogeneously suspended particles in physiological media. This definite status of the particles means an improvement for toxicological testing and understanding...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{innovative}} concrete applications have been theresult of technological developments as new processing techniques, {{the use of}} concrete admixtures and advanced materials. All these improvements increase the demand for better performing concrete with enhanced workability. However, the lack of reliable engineering tools in traditional concrete production methods has led to some inconsistent control of the workability. Therefore, todays research is increasingly investigating advanced models that capture the flow behavior of fresh concrete as accurately as possible. These models are continuously improving butgenerally keep facing problems which {{are linked to the}} agglomeration ofthe cement particles and to the implementation of combined concrete admixtures. The objective of this work is to investigate the rheological mechanism in cement paste for the combined use of superplasticizer, retarder and accelerator. In particular, an effect on the particle agglomeration is aimed for in order to contribute to a more fundamental understanding of the concretes flow behavior. Concerning the superplasticizer impact on cement paste, thermodynamic modelling and mineralogy studies led {{to the conclusion that the}} superplasticizer can change the hydrate morphology to such an extent that the interparticle contact forces are modified. The extra addition of retarder led to a densified polymer layer at the cement grain surface which contributed to the steric stabilization of the cement paste. An additional electrostatic effect and the induced changes in hydrate morphology are also demonstratedto contribute to the low paste viscosity. With the extra addition of a calcium salt accelerator to the cement paste, an interstitial structure was assumed to diminish the rheological effect of the polymer layer. All the developed conceptual mechanisms were implemented in a coherent agglomeration model, based on measurable parameters. In this model, the internal and external hydrates in a cement agglomerate were defined and quantified. Generally, the cumulative amount of hydrates within the agglomerates influenced the agglomerate stability and the amount of external hydrates determined the reagglomeration rate. For the superplasticizer only, a proportional relation was found between the change in agglomeration rate and the external agglomerate connectivity while, for the extra addition of retarder and accelerator, a reverse relation was found. The latter was attributed to a mechanical contribution of the interstitial volume. On the one hand, the retarder creates a source of slowly hydratingnuclei and particles in that volume and, on the other hand, these particles are expected to coagulate due to the accelerator addition. In the second case, the interstitial volume also delivered a contribution to thestress resistance of the cement paste at rest. This fundamental research combines dedicated analytical methods and conceptual models to improve the understanding of particle agglomeration and contributes to a more extensive insight into the concrete rheology.
