5|$|On May 3, 1917, the Brewers {{traveled}} to Indianapolis and defeated the team there {{to improve their}} win-loss record to 7–8. Shay visited a local tavern that night and had some drinks. The tavern owner took Shay to a beauty parlor and introduced him to its owner, Gertrude Anderson. Anderson gave Shay a manicure and accompanied him to the Hotel English. Shay complained to busboy Eugene Jones about the placement of sugar bowls <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>table.</b> Clarence Euell, a black waiter at the cafe, came to address Shay's concern. An argument ensued during which Shay pulled out a gun and shot Euell in the abdomen. Euell wrestled Shay to the ground, pressing his foot down on Shay's head.|$|E

25|$|As nightclub co-owner, Carlito declines several {{offers for}} a {{business}} partnership with an obnoxious young gangster from the Bronx named Benny Blanco (John Leguizamo). Carlito also rekindles his romance with his former girlfriend Gail (Penelope Ann Miller), a ballet dancer who moonlights as a stripper. Kleinfeld develops a love interest with Benny's girlfriend, Steffie, a waitress at the club. Benny's frustration with Carlito's constant rejections boils over and he confronts Carlito one night <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>table.</b> Carlito publicly humiliates Benny, who reacts by manhandling Steffie. Fueled by his now-extensive use of alcohol and cocaine, Kleinfeld brazenly pulls out a gun and threatens to kill Benny, but Carlito intervenes. Despite being personally threatened by Benny himself, Carlito lets Benny go unharmed; a decision which alienates Carlito's gangster friend and personal bodyguard Pachanga (Luis Guzmán).|$|E

25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Carlist-controlled territory, Maroto was well {{received by the}} Pretender, who seated him on numerous occasions <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>table</b> and tried {{to give him a}} responsible command, which he was unable to accomplish because of the opposition of General Tomás de Zumalacárregui, who always had a negative view of Maroto. When Zumalacárregui was injured in Bilbao, Maroto received a direct order from Don Carlos to replace him and took command of his army. However, the written order, manipulated, was confusing and almost contradictory: Don Carlos ordered that Maroto remain in the army, but under the orders of field marshal Francisco Benito Eraso, until, for reasons of health, the latter retired from the Army of the North. He was told to remain patient and in the meantime to obverse the actions of said general, which could be suspicious. Maroto's serious, authentically soldierly character won him at this time the friendship and confidence {{of the members of the}} forces, especially the common soldiers.|$|E

Parsons {{received}} {{permission from}} the Confederate States government to raise an independent company of mounted infantry to provide defense along the border. He set about enrolling volunteers and, within {{a short period of}} time, enlisted approximately 30 men. Following its organization, the company became known as the Huckleberry Rangers of the Confederate States Army's 13th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Parsons traveled to Richmond with a supply of cattle, and returned to his company's camp on the North River in Hampshire County around November 15, 1861. Throughout 1861, Col.

500|$|Lt.Blue and Parrish {{returned}} to Sugar Hollow where Parsons was awaiting them, and Parsons set about locating pine {{from which to}} make torches to light {{their way out of}} the hollow. Parsons carried with him a small hatchet, and he began splitting pine in the darkness to fashion a torch. Parsons accidentally struck himself in the knee with his hatchet, and Lt.Blue applied a handkerchief to the wound to stop its bleeding. The three men traveled through the dark and rain to the nearby home of Frank Carter, where they ate and dried their clothes by the fire. The following morning, the three men mounted their horses and traveled to Rev.Harris' home, where Parsons and Lt.Blue parted with Parrish. Parsons and Lt.Blue continued east over Town Hill and reached George Thompson's residence on the Little Cacapon River, which had risen due to the previous night's rainfall. Parsons and Lt.Blue remained with Thompson for two days until the Little Cacapon River subsided, and traveled to Blue's Gap, where they set up camp. There, Lt.Blue received orders from Col.Angus William McDonald to carry out an expedition to Romney for General Stonewall Jackson to ascertain the number of Union Army infantry, cavalry, and artillery present in and around the town. Lt.Blue departed for Romney with Parsons' son Isaac Parsons, Jr., and W.V. Parsons accompanying him. Throughout 1861, Parsons [...] "gratuitously" [...] provided Confederate soldiers with food <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>table</b> and horses from his stables at his Wappocomo plantation.|$|E

Meyrink was surprised by this dramatic coincidence and started to study {{the literature of the}} occult. He studied theosophy, Kabbala, Christian Sophiology and Eastern mysticism. Until his death Meyrink practiced yoga and other occult exercises. Results of these studies and practices are found in Meyrink's works, which almost always deal with various occult traditions.|$|E

2500|$|Back in the capital, {{he quickly}} gained the favour {{of the new}} emperor, the elderly Nikephoros III Botaneiates (...) , {{reportedly}} due to the latter's fondness for Syrian textiles, which Isaac often gave him as gifts. Accordingly, Botaneiates often called Isaac to dine <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>table,</b> gave him the high title of sebastos {{and the right to}} reside in the imperial palace. Despite the favour shown to them by Botaneiates, Isaac and Alexios plotted to advance the position of the Komnenos clan by deposing the emperor and seizing the throne. When Botaneiates' Bulgarian confidantes, Boril and Germanos, learned of their intentions, the brothers sought the protection of Empress Maria, who adopted Alexios. The [...] empress feared for status of her son by Michael VII, Constantine Doukas, whom Botaneiates intended to sideline in favour of a certain Synadenos. According to Anna Komnene, the brothers used the opportunity to reveal their plans to the empress, pledging to safeguard Constantine's rights to the succession. Thus, and trough Alexios' marriage to Irene Doukaina, the Komnenos brothers secured the support of the still powerful Doukas family.|$|E
2500|$|Leo Sgouros succeeded his father, Theodore Sgouros, in circa 1198 as {{governor}} of the area of Nauplia and the Argolid, one of the districts known as oria, that collected taxes and provided ships for the Byzantine navy. In circa 1201/1202, when a rebellion in Thessaly and Macedonia led by Manuel Kamytzes and Dobromir Chrysos cut southern Greece off from Constantinople, several revolts {{broke out in the}} Peloponnese: Leo Chamaretos seized control of Sparta, Monemvasia was plagued by violent disputes among its leading families. Leo himself seized the opportunity to establish himself as an independent ruler, capturing the citadels of Argos and Corinth. His hostility to the church, who by that time were seen as the [...] "defenders of the traditional order" [...] in the words of Michael Angold, was profound: the bishop of Nauplion was imprisoned, while the bishop of Corinth was invited to dinner, blinded and thrown to his death from the Acrocorinth. Indeed, Sgouros is generally presented as a violent man: in a letter, Michael Choniates, the bishop of Athens, recounts how Sgouros beat to death a young relative of his who had been delivered as a hostage, merely because he had dropped a glass while waiting <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
2500|$|At this time, his two daughters, Louisa and Sophia, {{the latter}} of whom became Mrs. Charles Thompson Haskell, {{were sent to the}} school of a Mr. Grimshaw, an Irishman then living in Philadelphia. Later the sisters were placed under the care of Mr. and Mrs. Picot, French refugees, with whom they {{continued}} to study for several years, becoming thoroughly conversant with the French language. Subsequently, the girls were introduced to Washington and Philadelphia society. It had not been her father's intention to educate his daughters in any other way than that usually given women in that day—a lighter academic course, with a [...] "finishing school" [...] for French, astronomy, and so forth. The graces of education were stressed rather than fundamentals. But Louisa early developed a passion for mathematics, and stated that a girl with such a love of knowledge should have every opportunity to perfect herself not only in mathematics, but also in other branches not then usually undertaken by women. She was then given just the same mathematical instruction that her brothers received. In this her education was unusual. In her father's study and <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>table</b> she met and heard the discourse of men whose speech has expressed national policies, whose style both in written and in spoken English is classic. Her father's contemporaries were Webster, Calhoun, Clay and their associates. Political economy was the gospel of their theories. The young girl, hearing them express their theories, learned to think deeply on political issues. The father's secession theory influenced Louisa and largely determined her mature writing.|$|E

2500|$|Blue Horse {{invariably}} dined with Burbank at {{noon and}} {{always had a}} good appetite. One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice that you always eat everything in front of you, but you never pass your plate back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? Is it because you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>table</b> left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children. It is needless to say that all the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved and he walked home barefooted.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 8 {{contains}} {{references to}} and quotes {{from many of}} the works Blake was exposed to and influenced by at a young age. These references include allusions to Saint Jerome, John Taylor's Urania, or his Heavenly Muse (1630), Abraham Cowley's translation of Anacreon's lyric poem [...] "The Grasshopper" [...] (1656), Henry Wotton's Reliquae Wottonianae (1685), John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690), Joseph Addison's Cato, a Tragedy (1712), Edward Young's Night-Thoughts (1742) and James Hervey's Meditations and Contemplations (1746) and Theron and Aspasio (1755). The Jerome reference is found in Steelyard's comment [...] "Says Jerome happiness is not for us poor crawling reptiles of the earth Talk of happiness & happiness its no such thing – every person has a something." [...] The Taylor reference is Steelyard’s poem; [...] "Hear then the pride & knowledge of a Sailor/His sprit sail fore sail main sail & his mizen/A poor frail man god wot I know none frailer/I know no greater sinner than John Taylor." [...] Although Alicia Ostriker feels this is a reference to the preacher John Taylor, David Erdman argues that the lines closely parallel the opening of the poem Urania , and as such, the reference is more likely to the poet than the preacher. The Cowley reference is found in the poem [...] "Phebe drest like beauties Queen", which contains the lines [...] "Happy people who can be/In happiness compard with ye." [...] Erdman believes this to be derived from the lines in Cowley's translation of Anacreon, [...] "Happy Insect! What can be/In Happiness compar'd to thee?" [...] The Wotton reference is found in Steelyard's [...] "My crop of corn is but a field of tares;" [...] John Sampson believes this to be reference to the Chidiock Tichborne poem [...] "Elegy" [...] (1586), which Blake could have been familiar with from Wotton's Reliquae. Locke is mentioned when Scopprell picks up one of Steelyard's books and reads the cover, [...] "An Easy of Huming Understanding by John Lookye Gent." [...] Addison is referred to indirectly when Steelyard attributes the quote [...] "the wreck of matter & the crush of worlds" [...] to Edward Young, when it is actually from Addison's Cato. Both the reference to Young and Hervey's Meditations are found in the opening sentence of the chapter; [...] "Steelyard the Lawgiver, sitting <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>table</b> taking extracts from Herveys Meditations among the tombs & Youngs Night thoughts." [...] The Theron reference is found when Steelyard announces to Obtuse Angle that he is reading the book.|$|E
