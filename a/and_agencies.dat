40|$|This article {{develops}} a distinctive critical realist analysis of structure <b>and</b> <b>agency.</b> It first describes Roy Bhaskarâ��s account of critical realism; then discusses critical realism in general; next introduces Anthony Giddensâ��s structuration theory and two particular applications of critical realism to structure <b>and</b> <b>agency</b> â�� those of Bhaskar and Margaret Archer; and, finally, presents a third such application {{based on the}} strategic-relational approach. The latter goes beyond conventional analyses of the duality, dualism, or dialectic of structure <b>and</b> <b>agency</b> by studying the recursive conditioning, mutual coupling, and complex co-evolution of structure <b>and</b> <b>agency</b> <b>and,</b> above all, by stressing the differential, spatio-temporal relationality of structure <b>and</b> <b>agency.</b> Its advantages over other approaches should emerge as we proceed...|$|R

The concept to understanding structuration is to understand to duality of structure [...] The similarity of Giddens’ theory and conversation and text theory is a mutual-existing and causal relationship of communication. The main difference, between the two, is structuration theory explains how communication impacts the organization, text and conversation, by means of structure <b>and</b> <b>agency.</b> Giddens' construct of structuration explains how mutually causal relationships constitute the essence of an organization. This concept illustrates how communication within an organization depends on the translation of meaning.|$|R
