5|$|In 1758, Johnson {{began to}} write a weekly series, The Idler, which ran from 15 April 1758 to 5 April 1760, as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> {{finishing}} his Shakespeare. This series was shorter and lacked many features of The Rambler. Unlike his independent publication of The Rambler, The Idler was published in a weekly news journal The Universal Chronicle, a publication supported by John Payne, John Newbery, Robert Stevens and William Faden.|$|E
5|$|National policy {{relating}} to the Cold War interested Flanders greatly. He {{was concerned about the}} world-wide encroachment of Communism even without force of arms. He felt that President Truman was generally a good president, but was hampered by the Roosevelt legacy of appeasing the Soviets. He also felt that Truman's commitment to bringing the Nationalist and Communist Chinese factions together into an alliance was mistaken. He endorsed the Marshall Plan as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> Communist influence in Western Europe. However, he was critical of John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State, for mishandling opportunities to create friendly alignment with Egypt and India, countries which instead sided with the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1820s, a fur trading route {{developed}} between the Red River Colony (in modern Manitoba) and the trading posts in Minnesota, first primarily at Mendota and later at Saint Paul. The system of ox cart trails {{came to be}} known as the Red River Trails and was used principally by the MÃ©tis as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the fur trade monopoly of the Hudson's Bay Company (which had absorbed the North West Company). Though this cross-border trade was entirely illegal and violated the policies of the Hudson's Bay Company, enforcement against the trade by American and British authorities was virtually non-existent. The trail system would reach its peak usage in the mid-19th century. The Hudson's Bay Company continued to expand its presence north of the U.S. border establishing new posts such as Fort Alexander and Rat Portage.|$|E

5|$|Practicing correct sexual {{practices}} was one method of perfecting the body's internal spirits. The Celestial Masters believed that semen is {{the embodiment of}} qi. If someone ejaculated too often, their life would be shortened. In fact, the Xiang'er indicates that people should not even have sex {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The Celestial Masters frowned upon the practice of heqi (also known as 'The Union of the Breaths') of not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain', and advocated non-ejaculation simply as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced. Despite their opposition to 'heqi' and reproductive sex, there is the possibility that the Celestial Masters supported sex for purposes other than reproduction, and a Celestial Master text from around the 5th century describes an elaborate sexual ritual.See Kalinowski(1985) for a full description of the ritual.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{frequently}} noted {{the parallels between}} the three hunting scenes and the three seduction scenes in Gawain. They are generally agreed that the fox chase has significant parallels to the third seduction scene, in which Gawain accepts the girdle from Bertilak's wife. Gawain, like the fox, fears for his life and is looking for <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> death from the Green Knight's axe. Like his counterpart, he resorts to trickery {{in order to save}} his skin. The fox uses tactics so unlike the first two animals, and so unexpectedly, that Bertilak has the hardest time hunting it. Similarly, Gawain finds the Lady's advances in the third seduction scene more unpredictable and challenging to resist than her previous attempts. She changes her evasive language, typical of courtly love relationships, to a more assertive style. Her dress, relatively modest in earlier scenes, is suddenly voluptuous and revealing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, a new keg policy {{was put into}} effect that {{requires}} all student groups to purchase kegs through Duke Dining Services. According to administrators, the rule change {{was intended as a}} way to ensure compliance with alcohol consumption laws as well as to increase on-campus safety. Some students saw the administration's increasingly strict policies as an attempt to alter social life at Duke. As a result, off-campus parties at rented houses became more frequent in subsequent years as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> Duke policies. Many of these houses were situated in the midst of family neighborhoods, prompting residents to complain about excessive noise and other violations. Police have responded by breaking up parties at several houses, handing out citations, and occasionally arresting party-goers. In the mid-to-late 2000s (decade), the administration made a concerted effort to help students re-establish a robust, on-campus social life and has worked with numerous student groups, especially the Duke University Union, to feature a wide array of events and activities. In March 2006, the university purchased 15 houses in the Trinity Park area that Duke students had typically rented and subsequently sold them to individual families in an effort to encourage renovations to the properties and to reduce off-campus partying in the midst of residential neighborhoods.|$|E

25|$|Anarcho-naturism {{advocated}} vegetarianism, free love, nudism, {{hiking and}} an ecological world view within anarchist groups and outside them. Anarcho-naturism promoted an ecological worldview, small ecovillages, and most prominently nudism as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the artificiality {{of the industrial}} mass society of modernity. Naturist individualist anarchists saw the individual in his biological, physical and psychological aspects and tried to eliminate social determinations.|$|E

A school might operate in one jurisdiction but use a mailing address in a different jurisdiction, for example.|$|E
25|$|The Arts and Crafts {{movement}} {{that took place}} between 1860 and 1910 also impacted occupational therapy. In the US, a recently industrialized country, {{the arts and crafts}} societies emerged against the monotony and lost autonomy of factory work. Arts and crafts were used as a way of promoting learning through doing, provided a creative outlet, and served as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> boredom during long hospital stays.|$|E
25|$|Klaus Reinhardt of the University of Sheffield {{and colleagues}} {{observed}} two morphologically {{different kinds of}} spermalege in Afrocimex constrictus, a species in which both male and females are traumatically inseminated. They found females use sexual mimicry as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> traumatic insemination. In particular, they observed males, and females who had male spermalege structures, were inseminated less often than females with female spermalege structures.|$|E

An uncompressed GIF file can be converted to an ordinary GIF file simply by passing it through an image editor.|$|E
25|$|To {{produce the}} {{circular}} motion, they used another concept {{known as the}} magnetron. The magnetron is essentially a diode that uses a magnetic field to control {{the path of the}} electrons from cathode to anode instead of the more common solution of an electrically charged grid. This was initially invented as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> patents on grid-based tubes but proved to be impractical in that role. Follow-up studies had noted the ability of the magnetron to create small levels of microwaves under certain conditions, but only halting development had taken place along these lines.|$|E

25|$|In 1942, Tordoff {{enlisted in}} the U.S. Army Air Forces, and trained as a fighter pilot. He later recounted that he naively {{imagined}} flying as thrilling, and <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> ground combat. His depth perception was low by Air Force standards, so he passed his vision test by watching another pilot candidate get tested, and figuring out how the settings worked on the apparatus that was used. In 1943 he earned his wings, and joined the 352nd Fighter Squadron, 353rd Fighter Group, 8th Air Force. He flew a total of 85 missions during the war, {{in support of the}} Allied bombing of Germany, and reached the rank of captain.|$|E
25|$|Soon this {{movement}} expanded {{outside of the}} youth realm and became a more widespread Muslim practice. Women viewed this way of dress {{as a way to}} both publicly announce their religious beliefs as well as a way to simultaneously reject western influences of dress and culture that were prevalent at the time. Despite many criticisms of the practice of hijab being oppressive and detrimental to womenâs equality, many Muslim women view the way of dress to be a positive thing. It is seen as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> harassment and unwanted sexual advances in public and works to desexualize women in the public sphere in order to instead allow them to enjoy equal rights of complete legal, economic, and political status. This modesty was not only demonstrated by their chosen way of dress but also by their serious demeanor which worked to show their dedication to modesty and Islamic beliefs.|$|E
