50|$|Athlete's foot {{is a form}} of {{dermatophytosis}} (fungal {{infection of}} the skin), caused by dermatophytes, fungi (most of which are mold) which inhabit dead layers of skin and digests keratin. Dermatophytes are <b>anthropophilic,</b> meaning these parasitic fungi prefer human hosts. Athlete's foot is most commonly caused by the molds known as Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes, but may also be caused by Epidermophyton floccosum. Most cases of athlete's foot in the general population are caused by T. rubrum; however, the majority of athlete's foot cases in athletes are caused by T. mentagrophytes.|$|E
50|$|Trichophyton rubrum is a dermatophytic fungus in the phylum Ascomycota, class Euascomycetes. It is an {{exclusively}} clonal, <b>anthropophilic</b> saprotroph that colonizes {{the upper}} layers of dead skin, {{and is the}} most common cause of athlete's foot, fungal infection of nail, jock itch, and ringworm worldwide. Trichophyton rubrum was first described by Malmsten in 1845 and is currently considered to be a complex of species that comprises multiple, geographically patterned morphotypes, several of which have been formally described as distinct taxa, including T. raubitschekii, T. gourvilii, T. megninii and T. soudanense.|$|E
50|$|The {{individual}} {{species of}} the complex are morphologically difficult to distinguish from each other, although {{it is possible for}} larvae and adult females.

50|$|Mafra-Neto has {{developed}} an artificial scent, called Abate, that has the key semiochemical elements to provide a signature of human host smell to mosquitoes and other blood feeding insects. Spraying abate on an animal can trick <b>anthropophilic</b> disease-transmitting insects, such as malaria mosquitoes, into attacking animals rather than their preferred human hosts, thereby reducing infection rates. Malaria-causing parasites, carried by mosquitoes, identify the human hosts that help them reproduce by detecting the semiochemicals that now are contained in the Abate formulation. Cattle are resistant to malaria and many other human diseases transmitted by insects, and are often treated with deworming medication, which has a toxic effect on mosquitoes and their parasites. Abate opens up the possibility for novel {{ways to reduce the}} impact of insect vectored diseases, such as malaria. This is being tested with generous funds from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The use of Abate in tandem with area-wide deworming campaigns has the potential to disrupt the transmission cycle of insect vectored human diseases, like malaria, in the treated areas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the genus}} was revised in 1989 by an academic paper published in the [...] of the American Museum of Natural History. In 1997, researchers from the Universidad Nacional del Comahue in Rio Negro, Argentina collected larvae of G. marginalis and other fly species in Lanin National Park, Neuquén Province. After a close examination included chromosome mapping, they reported:Females are not <b>anthropophilic</b> {{and can be found}} as well as in mountain creeks from sea level to 4,700 m of altitude (Wygodzinsky & Coscaron 1989). Gigantodax is a peculiar genus, showing the greatest diversity among the Prosimuliini genera, with synapomorphies in imago and preimaginal stages that help to differentiate species in this genus from other genera. The unusual morphology of the respiratory filaments in the pupal stage is useful in differentiating species.These South American researchers also analyzed G. marginalis, G. fulvescens, and G. chilensis and reported that Cnesia, another Prosimuliini genus, is sympatric with southern populations of Gigantodax and that both genera breed {{on both sides of the}} Andean range in Argentina and Chile in subantarctic Patagonia. They also reported that Gigantodax species in this area are also sympatric with Simulium.|$|E

40|$|Distribution, abundance, feeding behaviour, host preference, parity {{status and}} human-biting and {{infection}} rates {{are among the}} medical entomological parameters evaluated when determining the vector capacity of mosquito species.

Thus, collection methods must result {{in the identification of}} the <b>anthropophilic</b> species and efficiently evaluate the parameters involved in malaria transmission dynamics. Consequently, human landing catches would be the most appropriate method if not for their inherent risk. The choice of alternative anopheline collection methods, such as traps, must consider their effectiveness in reproducing the efficiency of human attraction. Collection methods lure mosquitoes by using a mixture of olfactory, visual and thermal cues.

40|$|Dermatophytes are {{the main}} cause of {{superficial}} mycoses of the skin in humans and animals. Moleculargenetic studies have given useful insights in the phylogeny and taxonomy of the dermatophytes and have thus helped to avoid the difficulties of conventional diagnostic methods. Trichophyton mentagrophytes sensu lato contains <b>anthropophilic</b> and zoophilic species. Although different molecular markers for the differentiation of strains belonging to this complex have been developed the correct identification remains problematic, especially with the delineation of <b>anthropophilic</b> and zoophilic strains of T. interdigitale. However, this differentiation is essential for the choice of the correct antimycotic treatment. For this reason 130 strains identified as T. mentagrophytes ss. lato by conventional methods have been examined with different molecular methods, such as RFLP and sequence analysis of the PCR-amplified ITS-region of the ribosomal DNA. This data was then compared to the results of the conventional methods to discover possible similiarities. The different species of T. mentagrophytes ss. lato showed multiple individual RFLP patterns and the following sequence analysis revealed several polymorphisms that can be helpful for the differentiation between <b>anthropophilic</b> and zoophilic strains of T. interdigitale in particular. The comparison of the epidemiological data showed that zoophilic strains of T. interdigitale have different hosts than the zoophilic species A. benhamiae.

40|$|Summary Background Dermatophytes are {{the main}} cause of {{superficial}} mycoses in humans and animals. Molecular research has given useful insights into the phylogeny and taxonomy of the dermatophytes to overcome the difficulties with conventional diagnostics. Objectives The Trichophyton mentagrophytes complex consists of <b>anthropophilic</b> as well as zoophilic species. Although several molecular markers have been developed for the differentiation of strains belonging to T. mentagrophytes sensu lato, correct identification still remains problematic, especially concerning the delineation of <b>anthropophilic</b> and zoophilic strains of T. interdigitale. This differentiation is not academic but is essential for selection of the correct antimycotic therapy to treat infected patients. Methods One hundred and thirty isolates identified by morphological characteristics as T. mentagrophytes sensu lato were investigated using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequence analysis of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA. Results Species of this complex produced individual RFLP patterns obtained by the restriction enzyme MvaI. Subsequent sequence analysis of the ITS 1, 5. 8 S and ITS 2 region of all strains, but of T. interdigitale in particular, revealed single unique polymorphisms in <b>anthropophilic</b> and zoophilic strains. Conclusions Signature polymorphisms were observed to be useful for the differentiation of these strains and epidemiological data showed a host specificity among zoophilic strains of T. interdigitale/Arthroderma vanbreuseghemii compared with A. benhamiae as well as characteristic clinical pictures in humans when caused by zoophilic or <b>anthropophilic</b> strains. The delineation is relevant because it helps in determining the correct treatment and provides clues regarding the source of the infection...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this work}} {{extracts}} from {{roots of the}} common vegetable Cichorium intybus L., highly appreciated for its bitter taste, were studied to investigate their possible biological activity on fungi {{from a variety of}} ecological environments: some are parasites on plants (phytopathogens) or of animals and humans (zoophilic and <b>anthropophilic</b> dermatophytes), others live on the soil and only seldom parasitize animals (geophilic dermatophytes). The extracts were ineffective on geophilic species and on tested phytopathogens, with the exception of Pythium ultimum, whereas they inhibited the growth of zoophilic and <b>anthropophilic</b> dermatophytes, in particular Trichophyton tonsurans var. sulfureum, whose treatment caused morphological anomalies, here observed by scanning electron microscopy.

40|$|A white Shannon-type trap {{was used}} for captures of female sand flies {{in the search for}} natural {{infection}} with flagellates, however, due to its low productivity and as a large number of phlebotomines settled on the researchers' black clothes, we decided to compare the relative attractiveness of black and white Shannon-type traps for sand flies. Several pairs of black and white traps were placed side by side in front of caves in four areas in the Serra da Bodoquena, Bonito county, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, for a total of 12 observations and 44 h of capture. The experiment resulted in 889 phlebotomines captured, 801 on the black and 88 on the white trap, representing 13 species. The hourly Williams' means were 8. 67 and 1. 24, respectively, and the black/white ratio was 7. 0 : 1. 0.

40|$|A {{strategy}} {{to decrease the}} vector competence of Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (Diptera: Culicidae), the most efficient malaria vector in Africa, may consist of exploiting the genes involved in zoophily.
