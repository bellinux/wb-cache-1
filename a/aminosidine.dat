40|$|This randomized, open {{sequential}} design {{trial was}} set up to assess the efficacy, tolerability and toxicity of 20 d courses of combined intramuscular <b>aminosidine</b> and sodium stibogluconate at various dosages in patients with newly-diagnosed kala-azar in Bihar, India. Three successive studies of 96 patients each were originally planned with <b>aminosidine</b> administered at 12, 6 and 3 mg/kg/d, respectively. For each <b>aminosidine</b> dosage, patients were randomly assigned to receive sodium stibogluconate at 20, 10 or 5 mg/kg/d of antimony. Ninety-six patients were enrolled and assigned <b>aminosidine</b> 12 mg/kg/d as scheduled. In the subsequent study with <b>aminosidine</b> at 6 mg/kg/d, the trial was interrupted after 40 patients had entered owing to inadequacy of the treatment. With <b>aminosidine</b> 12 mg/kg/d the success rates with sodium stibogluconate at 20, 10 and 5 mg/kg/d were 88 %, 71 % and 72 %, respectively and did not differ significantly. With <b>aminosidine</b> 6 mg/kg/d, 69 %, 50 % and 46 % of patients were cured with the same sodium stibogluconate doses, respectively; again, {{there was no significant difference}} between the subgroups.

40|$|<b>Aminosidine</b> is an older, broad-spectrum {{aminoglycoside}} antibiotic {{that has}} been shown to be effective in in vitro and animal models against multiple-drug-resistant tuberculosis and the Mycobacterium avium complex. The objective of this randomized, parallel trial was to characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetics of <b>aminosidine</b> sulfate in healthy subjects (eight males, eight females). Sixteen adults (mean [+/- standard deviation] age, 27. 6 +/- 5. 6 years) were randomly allocated to receive a single, intramuscular <b>aminosidine</b> sulfate injection at a dose of 12 or 15 mg/kg of body weight. Serial plasma and urine samples were collected over a 24 -h period and used to determine <b>aminosidine</b> concentrations by high-performance liquid chromatographic assay. A one-compartment model with first-order input, first-order output, and a lag time (Tlag) and with a weighting factor of 1 /y 2 best described the data. Compartmental and noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated with the microcomputer program WinNonlin. One subject was not included (15 -mg/kg group) because of the lack of sampling time data. On average, subjects attained peak concentrations of 22. 4 +/- 3. 2 microg/ml at 1. 34 +/- 0. 45 h. All subjects had plasma <b>aminosidine</b> concentrations below 2 microg/ml at 12 h, and all but two subjects (one in each dosing group) had undetectable plasma <b>aminosidine</b> concentrations at 24 h. The dose-adjusted area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity of <b>aminosidine</b> was identical for the 12 - and 15 -mg/kg groups (9. 29 +/- 1. 5 versus 9. 29 +/- 2. 2 microg x h/ml per mg/kg; P = 0. 998).

Pharmacokinetics and evaluation of renal function after repeated (once daily for 21 consecutive days) subcutaneous administration of <b>aminosidine,</b> at the dose of 15 mg/kg b. w. in both the healthy and the diseased animals were compared. Concentrations of <b>aminosidine</b> were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and pharmacokinetic analysis was performed by the non-compartmental method. No significant differences were observed between healthy and diseased dogs considering all pharmacokinetic parameters. In general, mean C-max ranged between 46. 41 and 54. 32 mu g/mL and between 38. 69 and 40. 73 mu g/mL in healthy dogs and in dogs with canine leishmaniosis, respectively.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} parasitological and {{clinical}} efficacy of four weeks versus {{two weeks of}} treatment with <b>aminosidine</b> (paromomycin) ointment in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Methods: Double-blind, randomized trial of four weeks of <b>aminosidine</b> ointment (n = 108) vs two weeks of <b>aminosidine</b> ointment and two weeks of placebo (n = 108). Patients were assessed on days 15, 29, 45, and 105 for clinical cures and clinical and parasitological cures. Findings: Four weeks' treatment gave significantly better cure rates than two weeks' treatment: on day 29, there were 80 / 108 (74 %) vs 64 / 108 (59 %) clinical cures (P = 0. 05) and 47 (44 %) vs 26 (24 %) clinical and parasitological cures (P = 0. 005). By day 45, fewer patients who received four weeks' treatment had required rescue treatment with antimonials than those who received two weeks' treatment: 20 (19 %) vs 36 (33 %) (P = 0. 02). On day 105, the results still favoured {{those who had been}} allocated four weeks of active treatment, but the differences were no longer as clearly significant. No side-effects were observed or reported. Conclusion: Approximately two-thirds of patients given ointment for four weeks were cured clinically. Although about half of those cured might have recovered spontaneously even without treatment, four weeks of <b>aminosidine</b> ointment could become the first-line treatment for uncomplicated cutaneous leishmaniasis due to L. major, with antimonials needed in only the one-third of patients not cured by the end of treatment with <b>aminosidine.</b> This would considerably reduce the costs and side-effects associated with antimonial drugs...|$|E

40|$|Canine leishmaniosis {{caused by}} Leishmania infantum {{is still a}} common disease in endemic areas, such as the Mediterranean countries, and has {{progressively}} expanded into non-endemic areas like Central and Northern Europe. The aim {{of this article is}} to critically review current knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. In dogs with typical clinical signs and clinicopathological abnormalities, diagnosis is relatively easy based on the exclusion of major differentials, the demonstration of the parasite (e. g., with lymph node and/or skin cytology) and the presence of Leishmania-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies (quantitative serology). In less typical cases, these criteria together with the exclusion of possible differentials and the demonstration of compatible histological lesions in affected organs and tissues form the basis for a sound diagnosis. In clinically healthy dogs, molecular techniques are the most sensitive means for detecting L. infantum infection. Treatment of canine leishmaniosis should follow clinical staging and is usually based on meglumine antimonate or miltefosine administration for a few weeks in combination with allopurinol for several months. However, allopurinol monotherapy may be used in very mild cases as well as in dogs with end stage kidney disease. <b>Aminosidine</b> administered once daily at a revised dosage shows some promise but additional controlled studies are needed. Close attention to published guidelines regarding treatment and follow-up is necessary to achieve the best possible therapeutic outcome. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} Bihar in India carries the largest {{share of the}} world's burden of antimony-resistant visceral leishmaniasis. We {{analysed}} clinical studies done in Bihar with different treatments between 1980 and 2004. Overall, 53 studies were included (all but one published), of which 15 were comparative (randomised, quasi-randomised, or non-randomised), 23 dose-finding, and 15 non-comparative. Data from comparative studies were pooled when appropriate for meta-analysis. Overall, these studies enrolled 7263 patients in 123 treatment arms. Adequacy of methods used to do the studies and report on them varied. Unresponsiveness to antimony has developed steadily {{in the past to}} such an extent that antimony must now be replaced, despite attempts to stop its progression by increasing dose and duration of therapy. The classic second-line treatments are unsuited: pentamidine is toxic and its efficacy has also declined, and amphotericin B deoxycholate is effective but requires hospitalisation for long periods and toxicity is common. Liposomal amphotericin B is very effective and safe but currently unaffordable because of its high price. Miltefosine-the first oral drug for visceral leishmaniasis-is now registered and marketed in India and is effective, but should be used under supervision to prevent misuse. Paromomycin (or <b>aminosidine)</b> is effective and safe, and although not yet available, a regulatory submission is due soon. To preserve the limited armamentarium of drugs to treat visceral leishmaniasis, drugs should not be deployed unprotected; combinations can make drugs last longer, improve treatment, and reduce costs to households and health systems. India, Bangladesh, and Nepal agreed recently to undertake measures towards the elimination of visceral leishmaniasis. The lessons learnt in Bihar could help inform policy decisions both regionally and elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{determine}} exon/intron {{organization of}} the Toxocara canis (T.  canis) AK (TCAK) and to test green and black tea and several other chemicals against the activity of recombinant TCAK in the guanidino-specific region by site-directed mutants. MethodsAmplification of genomic DNA fragments containing introns {{was carried out by}} PCRs. The open-reading frame (1200  bp) of TCAK (wild type) was cloned into the BamH 1 /SalI site of pMAL-c 2 X. The maltose-binding protein-TCAK fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli TB 1 cells. The purity of the expressed enzyme was verified by SDS-PAGE. Mutations were introduced into the guanidino-specific region and other areas of pMAL/TCAK by PCR. Enzyme activity was measured with an NADH-linked assay at 25  °C for the forward reaction (phosphagen synthesis). ResultsArginine kinase in T.  canis has a seven-exon/six-intron gene structure. The lengths of the introns ranged from 542  bp to 2 500  bp. All introns begin with gt and end with ag. Furthermore, we measured the enzyme activity of site-directed mutants of the recombinant TCAK. The Km value of the mutant (Alanine to Serine) decreased indicating a higher affinity for substrate arginine than the wild-type. The Km value of the mutant (Serine to Glycine) increased to 0. 19  mM. The Km value (0. 19  mM) of the double mutant (Alanine–Serine to Serine–Glycine) was slightly greater than in the wild-type (0. 12  mM). In addition, several other chemicals were tested; including plant extract Azadiracta indica (A.  indica), an aminoglycoside antibiotic (<b>aminosidine),</b> a citrus flavonoid glycoside (rutin) and a commercially available catechin mixture against TCAK. Green and black tea (1 : 10 dilution) produced 15 % and 25 % inhibition of TCAK, respectively. The extract of A.  indica produced 5 % inhibition of TCAK. Moreover, green and black tea produced a non-competitive type of inhibition and A.  indica produced a mixed-type of inhibition on TCAK. ConclusionsArginine kinase in T.  canis has a seven-exon/six-intron gene structure. However, further studies are needed to identify a specific compound within the extract causing the inhibitory effect and also to determine the molecular mechanisms behind inhibition of arginine kinase in T.  canis...|$|E
40|$|Canine {{leishmaniasis}} (CL), as {{it appears}} in the Mediterranean basin, {{is caused by the}} intracellular protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum. Today, it is by all means the most common arthropod - borne infectious disease in Greece. Its transmission among various mammalian species is carried out by the bites of blood-sucking sandflies (Phlebotomus sp.), harboring the flagellated promastigotes. The pathogenesis of overt disease should be focused on the overproduction of IgG antibodies against parasitic antigens, assumingly exemplifying a Th 2 immune response from the part of the host that may result in the deposition of circulating or in-situ forming immunocomplexes, usually targeting the skin, eyes, joints and kidneys. In the latter, chronic glomerulonephritis (e. g. mesangioproliferative, membranoproliferative, membranous, minimal change glomerulopathy) and eventually glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis may lead to chronic renal failure, end-stage renal disease and the death of the animal. The resultant proteinuria, {{one of the most common}} findings in the laboratory evaluation of CL cases, is partly responsible for the deterioration of glomerular lesions. Meglumine antimoniate, allopourinol, <b>aminosidine</b> and amphotericin B (AmB) are today’s cornerstone in the treatment of CL, though not associated with encouraging results regarding the parasitological cure rate and the definitive switching of Th 2 to Th 1 immunological response. Consequently, life-long therapy with allopurinol is usually mandatory to avoid clinical relapses. Therapeutic experience with human visceral leishmaniasis and the emergence of resistant L. infantum strains to antimonials have encouraged the use of the antifungal agent AmB in the treatment of CL. The commercially available lipid form (Ambisome®) or the emulsion of its desoxycholate salt with lipids for parenteral nutrition (Fungizone® plus Intralipid®) have been formulated in an attempt to lower the risk of nephrotoxicosis, mainly imposed via glomerular vasoconstriction with a subsequent reduction of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The goals of this prospective, open label and single-blinded but not placebo-controlled study were the following: 1) the evaluation of the clinical and parasitological efficacy and safety of lipid-formulated AmB in a large number of dogs with symptomatic CL (L. infantum), by applying a standard dosage scheme, 2) its effect on GFR and the level of glomerulonephritis-associated proteinuria, with or without enalapril, and 3) the long-term evaluation of enalapril therapy, with or without allopurinol, on both proteinuria level and GFR. Enalapril is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) with renoprotective properties that has been known to effectively attenuate proteinuria in humans, dogs and laboratory rodents with natural or experimental glomerulonephritis, mainly via its vasodilatory effect on the efferent glomerular arterioles, which opposes that of AmB. ...|$|E
40|$|Canine {{leishmaniasis}} is a frequently {{diagnosed disease}} in Greece. The earliest available records on canine leishmaniasis {{go back to}} the beginning of the 20 th century concerning dogs living in the area of Athens and later in several other areas in southern Greece. Since then, most of the available epidemiological data mainly concern the two biggest cities Athens and Thessaloniki and the surrounding areas. The objective of the first part of this study was to assess the regional exposure of dogs to Leishmania in Greece by determining its seroprevalence simultaneously in 7 geographical areas in clinically healthy dogs. Blood was collected from dogs living in the following areas: Attiki (1006), Evros (416), Evia (140), Evritania (200), Ioannina (233), Serres (479), Florina (146). A representative sample, regarding the size (more than 2 % of the roughly estimated canine population) and the distribution of dogs within the region was randomly selected. The following data were recorded for each dog using a standard questionnaire: the utility, the gender, the age and the length of haircoat. Differences in the distributions of seropositivity between genders, utilities, ages, type of haircoat and geographical regions in Greece were tested for significance (P< 0. 05) using the Pearson’s χ 2 test. The results of this study support the assumption that canine leishmaniosis is currently endemic in Greece. The highest seroprevalence was detected in dogs living in Attiki 30, 11 % and the lowest in Florina 2 %. Analysis of the results showed no difference in seroprevalence of the disease among groups formed according to the utility of dogs, gender and length of haircoat. On the contrary, a difference in seroprevalence among age groups was observed, which can probably be attributed to the increasing probability of a dog being exposed to Leishmania with time, and mainly to the long incubation period, rather than to a greater susceptibility among the adult dogs. Differences in seroprevalence among dogs living in different geographical regions could be explained by differences in climate, which favorises or not the survival of vectors of Leishmania. On the contrary, although Evros could be a habitat for sandflies, the seroprevalence is low. The wide use of insecticides as part of the programs for the control of olive parasites in the area could explain this result. Regarding the two different methods for antibody detection, no statistically significant differences were observed. The observed serological evidence of exposure to Leishmania of dogs in Greece as in other countries warrants scientists to take measures to reduce it. Evros is an indication that the control of such a disease could be based on the elimination of vectors. The second part of the study was carried out in order to evaluate safety and efficacy of <b>aminosidine</b> in the treatment of canine leishmaniosis in terms of pharmacokinetic behavior, clinical remission, restoration of clinicopathological abnormalities, serological tests, lymph node and bone marrow parasitological...|$|E
