500|$|Badu's songwriting was {{characterized}} by pointillism, stream of consciousness, and scenic narrative. Her lyrics are alternately overtly political and deeply personal, interlaced with Five Percenter notions and references to the Nation of Islam. Badu expresses a motherly perspective and feelings of dismay and empathy for {{the subjects in the}} songs. Charles Aaron commented that [...] "a sense of history and maternal compassion ... grounds even her most oblique forays." [...] Abebe wrote similarly, [...] "her keen writing about people" [...] gives songs [...] "much of their shape" [...] and views that her candor helps communicate the album's [...] "social concerns, which could otherwise sound like <b>a</b> <b>laundry</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> black-community struggles".|$|E

In {{his review of}} Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, [...] "Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment."

2500|$|IGN's Dan Adams {{wrote of}} The Wolf Age, [...] "Fans {{of the series}} shouldn't be {{disappointed}} by MumboJumbo's effort {{to follow in the}} mighty footsteps that Bungie left behind." [...] GameSpot's Sam Parker wrote, [...] " [...] Myth IIIs single-player game represents the best the Myth series has to offer." [...] However, he was critical of the absence of many promised multiplayer features, the absence of the Vengeance mapmaking tool, and compatibility issues with Windows XP. GameSpy's William Abner wrote, [...] " [...] The Wolf Age isn't a complete product. It's close. And parts of it are just as fun, if not more so, than the earlier games, but <b>a</b> <b>laundry</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> bugs, hardware glitches, and severe multiplayer issues keep the game from reaching its potential."

2500|$|In {{his review}} for the journal Intersections: Gender and Sexuality in Asia and the Pacific, Yves Laberge opined {{that the book}} was not an art book and claimed that it gave a [...] "partial account of 's career"; he also claimed that Miyao might have adapted it from his Ph.D. thesis. However, Laberge wrote that the book would be useful for {{undergraduates}} in Asian American studies, Japanese studies, cultural studies, and film history, and also in gender studies and cross-cultural studies. Additionally, {{he felt that the}} book was short. Duke magazine Edward M. Gomez criticized what he perceived to be the repetitious nature of the book and said that it [...] " [...] like <b>a</b> <b>laundry</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> plot summaries."

2500|$|GameSpy's William Abner scored it 75 out of 100, {{writing that}} the game [...] "isn't a {{complete}} product. It's close. And parts of it are just as fun, if not more so, than the earlier games, but <b>a</b> <b>laundry</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> bugs, hardware glitches, and severe multiplayer issues keep the game from reaching its potential." [...] He praised the single-player campaign and the storyline. However, he cited numerous bugs, including no support for Windows 95, despite the box claiming otherwise, and compatibility issues with Windows XP. He was also critical {{of the absence of}} Vengeance, despite the box stating it was included, and the fact that multiplayer mode had only five maps and no TCP/IP support. He concluded [...] "If you need your new Myth fix and can't wait for a patch, then the best option is to buy the game from a store that accepts returns in case the game doesn't like your particular system setup. If you can play it, focus your efforts on the campaign - it's fun, {{and for the most part}} works as advertised. Hopefully, by the time you are finished with Connacht's tale, a patch to fix the many multiplayer issues will be ready." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{review is}} focused on the risk of {{exposure}} and adverse impacts from wastewater generated by shale gas development. The primary sources of wastewater are: (1) hydraulic fracture fluid waste that flows back out of the well after wellbore stimulation (“flowback”) and (2) formation water that is produced along with shale gas (also called “produced water ” or “production brines”). These two sources of waste combine to form shale gas wastewater streams that require careful review, consideration, and regulation by the NYSDEC. Hydraulic fracturing flowback not only contains chemicals added during well stimulation, but also includes constituents present in the shale zone formation water that may be released during the hydraulic fracturing process. The data in the DSGEIS is insufficient to adequately evaluate this risk. The DSGEIS provides <b>a</b> general <b>laundry</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> chemicals that may potentially be used in hydraulic fracturing fluids; however, the actual formulation and the quantities of each chemical in use is only discussed in minimal terms. There is no information to describe the potential chemical interactions that may also result in additional contaminates formed in the wastewater. The DSGEIS lacks sufficient information to conduct a risk assessment. A risk assessment for th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} proving that a user has selected and correctly employed a truly random seed in the generation of her RSA key pair. This task {{is related to the}} problem of key validation, the process whereby a user proves to another party that her key pair has been generated securely. The aim of key validation is to pursuade the verifying party that the user has not intentionally weakened or reused her key or unintentionally made use of bad software. Previous approaches to this problem have been ad hoc, aiming to prove that a private key is secure against specific types of attacks, e. g., that an RSA modulus is resistant to elliptic-curve-based factoring attacks. This approach results in <b>a</b> rather unsatisfying <b>laundry</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> security tests for keys. We propose a new approach that we refer to as key generation with verifiable randomness (KEGVER). Our aim is to show in zero knowledge that a private key has been generated at random according to a prescribed process, and is therefore likely to benefit from the full strength of the underlying cryptosystem. Our proposal may be viewed as a kind of distributed key generation protocol involving the user and verifying party. Because the resulting private key is held solely by the user, however, we are able to propose a protocol much more practical than conventional distributed key generation. We focus here on a KEGVER protocol for RSA key generation. Key words: certificate authority, key generation, non-repudiation, publickey infrastructure, verifiable randomness, zero knowledge...|$|R
