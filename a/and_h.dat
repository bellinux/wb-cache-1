However in cumulus cells, GDF 9 remained stable during IVM upto 12 <b>h</b> of maturation <b>and</b> decreased significantly between 12 <b>h</b> <b>and</b> 24 <b>h</b> of maturation. In case of BMP 15 significant reduction was observed between 0 <b>h</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>h,</b> stayed stable upto 12 <b>h</b> <b>and</b> become undetectable at 24 h of maturation.

40|$|Net form of {{net blotch}} (NFNB), caused by Pyrenophora teres Drechs. f. teres Smedeg., {{is a serious}} disease problem for the barley {{industry}} in Australia {{and other parts of}} the world. Three doubled haploid barley populations, Alexis/Sloop, WI 2875 - 1 /Alexis, and Arapiles/Franklin, were used to identify genes conferring adult plant resistance to NFNB in field trials. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) identified were specific for adult plant resistance because seedlings of the parental lines were susceptible to the NFNB isolates used in this study. QTLs were identified on chromosomes 2 H, 3 <b>H,</b> 4 <b>H,</b> <b>and</b> 7 <b>H</b> in both the Alexis/Sloop and WI 2875 - 1 /Alexis populations and on chromosomes 1 <b>H,</b> 2 <b>H,</b> <b>and</b> 7 <b>H</b> in the Arapiles/Franklin population.
