5|$|The {{music and}} {{instruments}} in each level {{were chosen to}} correspond to the game world and the level's placement in the overall emotional arc. The music is composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks that rise and fall in correlation with the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and bassoons. The number of instruments playing increases in correlation {{with the amount of}} petals that the player gathers. The music is meant to suggest natural sounds like wind. The instrument tracks were intended to be able to stand on their own, even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached to <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> that needed alteration that he composed a new piece to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the PlayStation Network. The album, titled Flower: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game, contains 8 tracks with a total duration of 1:04:37.|$|E

25|$|Liszt's own {{point of}} view {{regarding}} programme music can for the time of his youth be taken from the preface of the Album d'un voyageur (1837). According to this, a landscape could evoke a certain kind of mood. Since <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> could also evoke a mood, a mysterious resemblance with the landscape could be imagined. In this sense the music would not paint the landscape, but it would match the landscape in a third category, the mood.|$|E
25|$|Temporal {{aliasing}} is a {{major concern}} in the sampling of video and audio signals. Music, for instance, may contain high-frequency components that are inaudible to humans. If <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> is sampled at 32000 samples per second (Hz), any frequency components above 16000 Hz (the Nyquist frequency for this sampling rate) will cause aliasing when the music is reproduced by a digital to analog converter (DAC). To prevent this, an anti-aliasing filter is used to remove components above the Nyquist frequency prior to sampling.|$|E
25|$|Drone doom (also {{known as}} drone metal) is {{a style of}} doom metal that is largely defined by drones; notes or chords that are {{sustained}} and repeated throughout <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> Typically, the electric guitar is performed with large amounts of reverb and feedback while vocals, if present, are usually growled or screamed. Songs are often very long and lack beat or rhythm in the traditional sense. Drone doom is generally influenced by drone music, noise music and minimalist music. The style emerged in the early 1990s and was pioneered by Earth, Boris and Sunn O))).|$|E

25|$|In July 1854 Liszt {{stated in}} his essay about Berlioz and Harold in Italy that not all music was {{programme}} music. If, {{in the heat of}} a debate, a person would {{go so far as to}} claim the contrary, it would be better to put all ideas of programme music aside. But it would be possible to take means like harmony, modulation, rhythm, instrumentation and others to let a musical motif endure a fate. In any case, a programme should be added to <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> only if it was necessarily needed for an adequate understanding of that piece.|$|E
25|$|Cocks {{claims that}} Kubrick has elaborately coded {{many of his}} {{historical}} concerns into the film with manipulations of numbers and colors and his choice of musical numbers, {{many of which are}} post-war compositions influenced by the horrors of World War II. Of particular note is Kubrick's use of Penderecki's The Awakening of Jacob to accompany Jack Torrance's dream of killing his family and Danny's vision of past carnage in the hotel, <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> originally associated with the horrors of the Holocaust. As such, Kubrick's pessimistic ending in contrast to Stephen King's optimistic one is in keeping with the motifs that Kubrick wove into the story.|$|E
25|$|Although Schenker himself usually {{presents}} his analyses in the generative direction, {{starting from}} the fundamental structure (Ursatz) to reach the score, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, {{starting from the}} score and showing {{how it can be}} reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the Ursatz is arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise. Even at intermediate levels of the reduction, rhythmic notation (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) shows not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitch-events. Schenkerian analysis is subjective. There is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst. The analysis represents a way of hearing (and reading) <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E

25|$|While his {{teaching}} abilities were widely acknowledged, Hanson struggled to gain recognition for his talents as a composer {{for much of}} his career, as his music was often unpopular with the audience at that time and also unfashionable. He was fifty-four years old before receiving his first commission for <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music,</b> and many of his works lay unperformed for many decades. Part of the problem lay with his independence of mind. Hanson ignored prevailing trends in the pursuit of his own muse. In the 1940s and 1950s, his work was regarded by his Australian contemporaries as too avant-garde, but by the 1960s it was being dismissed as not avant-garde enough. Hanson's rejection of serialism, responsible for the latter dismissal, was ultimately vindicated by history, but this vindication came late in his career.|$|E
25|$|European art {{music is}} largely {{distinguished}} from many other non-European classical and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 11th century. Western staff notation {{is used by}} composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (which form the melodies, basslines and chords), tempo, metre and rhythms for <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and ad libitum ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form or a derivation of this form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the fugue, concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Jarre was {{contacted}} by the musical director of the Houston Grand Opera with the proposal for him related to the celebrations of Texas' 150th birthday in 1986, 150th birthday {{of the city of}} Houston and NASA's 25th birthday. Because of NASA's involvement, Jarre got the chance to keep in contact with a friend of his, astronaut captain Bruce McCandless II who later introduced Jarre to a flight companion of his, astronaut and jazz musician Ron McNair. Together they had the idea that for the celebrations, Jarre would create <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> that could be performed by McNair on his saxophone. The idea was that McNair, on his next trip into space in the Challenger Space Shuttle, would perform (and record onto video) the new piece of music, which would then be projected (through video playback) onto a giant screen that was to be constructed on the front of one of the buildings.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} emphasized, {{to a level}} {{never before}} seen, the supposed sexual undercurrents {{of the story of}} Titania's infatuation with Bottom after he turns into an ass. Brook was influenced by Jan Kott's study of the play in Shakespeare Our Contemporary, in which Kott notes the phallic properties of the donkey, and argues that Oberon deliberately degrades Titania by exposing her to this monstrous sexuality. In Brook's staging, Bottom entered Titania's bower carried by the fairies, one of whom thrust his upraised arm between Bottom's legs to represent a phallus. In a jab at more traditional stagings, the sequence was accompanied by Mendelssohn's Wedding March, <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> originally written to be played as an intermezzo between Acts IV and V, but often used in more genteel productions for the final marriage scene of the play. Despite the disturbing undercurrents of this view of sexuality, many audience members found the play witty and affectionate in its treatment of sex, in tune with the spirit of 1960s permissiveness.|$|E
25|$|The Medieval period {{includes}} {{music from}} {{after the fall}} of Rome to about 1400. Monophonic chant, also called plainsong or Gregorian chant, was the dominant form until about 1100. Polyphonic (multi-voiced) music developed from monophonic chant throughout the late Middle Ages and into the Renaissance, including the more complex voicings of motets. The Renaissance era was from 1400 to 1600. It was characterized by greater use of instrumentation, multiple interweaving melodic lines, {{and the use of the}} first bass instruments. Social dancing became more widespread, so musical forms appropriate to accompanying dance began to standardize. It is in this time that the notation of music on a staff and other elements of musical notation began to take shape. This invention made possible the separation of the composition of <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> from its transmission; without written music, transmission was oral, and subject to change every time it was transmitted. With a musical score, a work of music could be performed without the composer's presence. The invention of the movable-type printing press in the 15th century had far-reaching consequences on the preservation and transmission of music.|$|E
