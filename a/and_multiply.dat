5|$|Coalitions between organisms of {{the same}} species have also evolved. An extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects, such as bees, {{termites}} and ants, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a colony that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's germ cells to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals <b>and</b> <b>multiply</b> inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth causes cancer.|$|E

50|$|The floating-point unit (FPU) {{consisted}} of four functional units, an adder, a <b>multiplier,</b> divide unit <b>and</b> square root unit. The adder <b>and</b> <b>multiplier</b> are pipelined, but the divide and square root units are not. Adds <b>and</b> <b>multiplies</b> have a latency of three cycles and the adder <b>and</b> <b>multiplier</b> can accept a new instruction every cycle.

5|$|Elsewhere, {{such as in}} the UK, hares are {{not always}} seen as pests, and there are species action plans aiming to {{significantly}} increase their numbers. Some coursers say that coursing assists conservation because it leads to sporting landowners creating a habitat suitable for hares. Opponents of coursing say that the converse is true, namely that coursing takes place where hares live rather than hares living where coursing takes place. It is also the case that coursing kills slower hares, and it is said by some coursers that this leaves faster hares to breed <b>and</b> <b>multiply.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} {{bacteria}} kill and then consume other microorganisms, these species are called predatory bacteria. These include organisms such as Myxococcus xanthus, which forms swarms of cells that kill and digest any bacteria they encounter. Other bacterial predators either attach to their prey {{in order to}} digest them and absorb nutrients, such as Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus, or invade another cell <b>and</b> <b>multiply</b> inside the cytosol, such as Daptobacter. These predatory bacteria {{are thought to have}} evolved from saprophages that consumed dead microorganisms, through adaptations that allowed them to entrap and kill other organisms.|$|E
5|$|Known as viremia, the {{presence}} of a virus in the bloodstream enables it to be widely distributed throughout the body. Poliovirus can survive <b>and</b> <b>multiply</b> within the blood and lymphatics for long periods of time, sometimes as long as 17 weeks. In a small percentage of cases, it can spread and replicate in other sites, such as brown fat, the reticuloendothelial tissues, and muscle. This sustained replication causes a major viremia, and leads to the development of minor influenza-like symptoms. Rarely, this may progress and the virus may invade the central nervous system, provoking a local inflammatory response. In most cases, this causes a self-limiting inflammation of the meninges, the layers of tissue surrounding the brain, which is known as nonparalytic aseptic meningitis. Penetration of the CNS provides no known benefit to the virus, and is quite possibly an incidental deviation of a normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus spreads to the CNS are poorly understood, but it appears to be primarily a chance event—largely independent of the age, gender, or socioeconomic position of the individual.|$|E

25|$|If {{the exact}} values of large factorials are needed, {{they can be}} {{computed}} using arbitrary-precision arithmetic.

25|$|RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK MAP kinase pathway {{plays an}} {{important}} role in melanocytes, where melanoma arises. Stimulation of membrane bound receptors including tyrosine kinases and G-proteins receptors promote activation of RAS then activates RAF kinases which in turn promotes MEK then ERK activation. All of these proteins work together to help cell survival. A BRAF mutation in this activation chain triggers malignant transformation in melanoma cells. Melanoma relies on this BRAF mutation to grow <b>and</b> <b>multiply</b> as a tumor cell.|$|E

The organism forms heat-resistant spores that are not killed by alcohol-based hand cleansers or routine surface cleaning. Thus, these spores survive in clinical environments for long periods. Because of this, the bacteria may be cultured from almost any surface. Once spores are ingested, their acid-resistance allows them to pass through the stomach unscathed. Upon exposure to bile acids, they germinate <b>and</b> <b>multiply</b> into vegetative cells in the colon.|$|E
