One study finds that while slave prices rose across the South {{in the years after}} 1850 it appears that [...] "the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act increased prices in border states by 15% to 30% more than in states further south", illustrating how the Act altered the chance of successful escape.|$|R

The essence of this act was that non-US firms which sell below cost price in the US could be fined and the money is given to the US companies who made the complaint in the first place. The <b>act</b> <b>adversely</b> <b>affected</b> the commodities business of the complainant states and has since been repealed after WTO ruled the act to be illegal.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{efficiency}} and solvency of savings and loans institutions (thrifts). Thrifts that were inefficient (according to a nonparametric measure) were 4 1 / 2 {{times more likely than}} efficient thrifts to fail in the future. We also find that absent controls for lines of business pursued, stock institutions were both less efficient and more likely to fail than mutuals. With controls, these results are reversed. A consistent explanation is that stock institutions are better at resolving the standard agency conflict between owners and managers, but worse at resolving the "asset-substitution" conflict between shareholders and debtholders (depositors). Last, we find that some lines of business deregulated by the Garn-St. Germain <b>Act</b> <b>adversely</b> <b>affected</b> efficiency and solvency. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} what {{it means}} for one act to be more ambiguous than another. The question is evidently analogous to asking what makes one prospect riskier than another, but beliefs are neither objective nor representable by a unique probability. Our starting point is an abstract class of preferences constructed to be (strictly) partially ordered by a more ambiguity averse relation. First, we define two notions of more ambiguous with respect to such a class. A more ambiguous (I) act makes an ambiguity averse decision maker (DM) worse off but does not affect the welfare of an ambiguity neutral DM. A more ambiguous (II) <b>act</b> <b>adversely</b> <b>affects</b> a more ambiguity averse DM more, as measured by the compensation they require to switch acts. Unlike more ambiguous (I), more ambiguous (II) does not require indifference of ambiguity neutral elements to the acts being compared. Second, we implement the abstract definitions to characterize more ambiguous (I) and (II) for two explicit preference families: Î±-maxmin expected utility and smooth ambiguity. Thirdly, we give applications to the comparative statics of more ambiguous in a standard portfolio problem and a consumption-saving problem.

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{employer}} {{sanctions for}} hiring undocumented workers {{introduced by the}} 1986 Immigration Reform and Control <b>Act</b> (IRCA) <b>adversely</b> <b>affected</b> the hourly earnings of Latino workers in the southwestern U. S. We exploit the staggering of the sanctions and employee verification requirements across sectors to estimate this effect. In particular, IRCA's employer-sanctions provisions were not extended to agricultural employers until two years after their imposition on non-agricultural employers. Hence, Latino agricultural workers provide a control group against which to compare changes in the wages of Latinos in non-agricultural employment. We find substantial pre-post IRCA declines in the hourly earnings of Latino nonagricultural workers relative to Latinos in agriculture. This pattern, however, is considerably stronger for Latino men than Latina women. We do not observe similar inter-sectoral shifts in relative wages among non-Latino white workers. In fact, the relat [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} deregulation and restructuring on public-interest environmental research conducted by electric utilities in the US from 1990 to 2001. I find that deregulation has had a substantial negative impact on such expenditures, which have declined by 40 %. However, restructuring has had no significant impact. In addition, the 1990 Clear Air <b>Act</b> Amendments have <b>adversely</b> <b>affected</b> such expenditures, contrary to the positive impact these regulations had on pollution abatement R&D {{as shown in the}} literature. Results also suggest that state and firm characteristics and regulator preferences play a strong role in the conduct of such research.

40|$|The {{subprime}} mortgage crisis {{occurred in}} the United States in 2008, which struck the U. S. economy tremendously, and moreover, the world’s economy. In response to the crisis, the U. S. government enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Act, however, focused mainly on enhancing regulatory systems rather than considering how the Act affected small-scale financial institutions, including thrifts, which {{play a major role}} in the U. S. local housing development industry. In addition, the Act did not accord with the principles of the Government Accountability Office, and left certain regulatory measures intact, including the Qualified Thrift Lending test. Under this new regime, thrifts may face difficulty maintaining their businesses because of the heavy burden of complying with stringent and inappropriate regulations that were passed following the Act. In addition to the problematic issues facing the U. S., Korean savings banks have also been meeting difficulties since the Korean Savings Bank Crisis of 2010, which resulted in the failure of twenty-five percent of total savings banks and cost more than 26 billion with more than 100, 000 victims. Even though the Korean government tried to solve the problems facing the savings bank industry after the crisis, savings banks have still been struggling to operate successfully. This lack of improvement is in part due to deficiencies in the financial regulatory system, such as lenient and insufficient regulations. This dissertation analyzes how the Dodd-Frank <b>Act</b> <b>adversely</b> <b>affects</b> the thrift industry with intensified regulations, and then offers suggestions on how to create more efficient regulations for the thrift industry. This dissertation also studies how the Korean savings bank industry can overcome its current trouble by analyzing the similarities between the savings bank crisis and two U. S. experiences,the Savings 2 ̆ 6 Loans Association Crisis of the 1980 s, and the Mortgage Crisis of 2008, and by researching what can be learned from the experiences...|$|R
40|$|Experimental mycotoxicoses was induced into broiler {{chickens}} {{by feeding}} 1 ppm aflatoxin (AF) and 20 ppm cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) from 0 to 28 days of age {{to evaluate the}} gross and histopathological changes. Grossly, AF and AF-CPA fed birds showed enlargement, yellowish discoloration of the liver while the CPA fed birds showed enlargement and congestion. The CPA and AF-CPA fed birds showed thickening of crop and necrosis and thickening of proventricular mucosa. Histopathologically, degenerative and necrotic changes were observed in the liver, kidneys, intestine, pancreas, heart, pectoral muscle, spleen and bursa of Fabricius of all toxin fed birds. Besides, hyperplastic changes were also observed in the crop, proventriculus and gizzard in the CPA fed birds. The lesions were more marked in the AF-CPA group. The study revealed that AF and CPA in combination could <b>act</b> cumulatively and <b>adversely</b> <b>affect</b> the health of broiler chicken.

40|$|Since {{the coming}} into force of the Charter as primary law of the EU, Article 47 CFR is ‘the {{reference}} standard’ when the Court deals with issues of ffective judicial protection. However, the general principle of effective judicial protection existed already for some 25 years, developed in the case law of the Union courts. While the interpretation and application of Article 47 build upon this case law, a number of changes can be pointed out. What was formerly under the loose umbrella of effective judicial protection and related principles is now split over three different articles of the Charter. On the one hand, these provisions are partly overlapping; on the other hand, their configuration also leads to a lacuna. This gap is bridged by the unwritten general principles such as the rights of defence. When compared to the pre-Charter era, Article 52 (1) CFR structures the review of limitations of fundamental rights in a more compelling fashion. Specifically for Article 47 CFR, which has to be interpreted in harmony with Article 6 ECHR, the implicit limitations of Article 6 ECHR constitute a potential trap of ‘double limitation’. Article 47 may be relied upon by individuals alleging a violation of rights and freedoms conferred upon them by EU law. However, the principle of effective judicial protection is broader in application, providing protection against <b>acts</b> that <b>adversely</b> <b>affect</b> an individual’s interests. In {{so far as the}} interpretation of Article 47 would not reach the same scope and level of protection as the general principle of effective judicial protection, this principle should continue to apply...|$|R
