5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E
500|$|Donald Zec in the Daily Mirror {{was equally}} damning of Lazenby's acting abilities, {{comparing}} him unfavourably to Connery: [...] "He looks uncomfortably {{in the part}} like a size four foot in a size ten gumboot." [...] Zec was kinder to Lazenby's co-star, saying that [...] "there is style to Diana Rigg's performance <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that the last scene which draws something of a performance out of Lazenby owes much to her silken expertise." [...] The New York Times critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby, saying that [...] "Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement." ...|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} Laurent should have {{received}} the nomination at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards saying, [...] "In drawing attention to one performer, in particular, whom they {{left out of the}} Best Supporting Actress category, [...] I flat-out adore this performance <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that many others do too," [...] and further lauding Laurent's performance added, [...] " [...] is radiant and, in a unique Tarantino way, heartbreaking. Sexy and luminous in the heat of her valor. Putting out fire – and setting it. It becomes an anthem of noirish dread and excitement, a sign that Laurent, as Shosanna, has found her destiny." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I had a {{suspicion}} that you didn’t want to know. You’re a fastidious fellow, you know, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> that you’d rather leave a mean job {{of that kind}} to me.” ...|$|R
60|$|That {{evening after}} dinner Tom came in alone, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> that Perry had sent him. He was fidgety, ill at ease, and {{presently}} asked if I {{could see him}} a moment in my study. Maude's glance followed us.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well,” said Mrs. Ruck, “I’m glad you’ve {{had some}} company.” Her husband looked at her, in silence, through narrowed eyelids, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> that her unusually gracious {{observation}} {{was prompted by}} the less innocent aftertaste of her own late pastime.|$|R
500|$|Many {{people in}} the {{community}} wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience and, in particular, the light-hearted atmosphere. One participant, a man named John Codman, joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843. He wrote, [...] "It was for the meanest a life above humdrum, and for the greatest something far, infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all". The idealism of the community sometimes was not met, however. Because the community was officially secular, a variety of religions were represented, though not always amicably. When Isaac Hecker and, later, Sophia Ripley converted to Catholicism, a Protestant Brook Farmer complained, [...] "We are beginning to see wooden crosses around and pictures of saints... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that rosaries are rattling under aprons." ...|$|E
500|$|Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph {{was more}} {{critical}} with the episode, stating, [...] "having {{set up an}} interesting cliffhanger last week, it was a tad annoying that Steven Moffat did his trick again of taking a swerve with the pre-credits section of this week's episode, and more supposed shock value with the shootings of Amy and Rory," [...] but also more annoyed [...] "that what exactly was going on here, {{and how it was}} influenced by the events of the previous episode, were never exactly explained, leaving the audience to fill in the blanks." [...] Fuller believed that the plot and ending [...] "only raised more questions than answers," [...] believing that the overarching storyline would [...] "require the audience's concentration over many weeks; any casual viewer tuning in this week, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> not a few fans, will have been left baffled by the goings-on," [...] but still felt the episode [...] "was interesting and showed just how, when the writers use their imagination, Doctor Who can tell stories in a way little else on television can." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the editor}} of Personal Computer World was on holiday in May 1981, his colleagues publicised the magazine's review of the ZX81 with a cover showing a {{chimpanzee}} with the machine above the strapline [...] "Editor benchtests the ZX81". (The chimp returned in later issues to [...] "benchtest" [...] all of Sinclair's subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented [...] "absolutely amazing value for money". He described the ZX81 as [...] "a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting {{to find out more}} about computers, but without it costing them an arm and a leg" [...] and concluded: [...] "If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that. Children will love the ZX81, there can be no question about that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that more than a few people who are already familiar with computers will buy one, just to have a bit of fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mrs. Ruck, [...] "I'm glad you've {{had some}} company." [...] Her husband looked at her, in silence, through narrowed eyelids, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> that this gracious {{observation}} on the lady's part {{was prompted by}} a restless conscience.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it {{scarcely}} {{amounted to}} an interview," [...] Deane answered composedly. [...] "The man was drunk, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> found him offensive. He brandished the document at me {{on which the}} present case is founded, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> him of an attempt at blackmail. I had him thrown out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he said, [...] "that {{there can}} be no doubt about that. I saw the Chinaman whom Laura is so fond of sneaking away from this tent a few minutes ago, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> some devilry. That is why <b>I</b> went <b>and</b> fetched my revolver." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1999 Pyramid {{magazine}} named Button Men {{as one of}} the Millennium's Best Games. [...] Editor Scott Haring said [...] "This game {{just gets}} more and more impressive every time I look at it. ... the idea is so simple, and the strategy so subtle [...] [...] [...] I've never figured out exactly how to master this game, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that's because there is no good way to do so." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bellesiles {{energized}} this professional consensus {{by attempting}} to play [...] "the professors against the NRA in a high-wire act of arrogant bravado." [...] For instance, he replied to Heston’s criticism by telling the actor to earn a Ph.D. before criticizing the work of scholars. [...] He pointed out that Cramer was [...] "a long time advocate of unrestricted gun ownership" [...] {{while he was a}} scholar who had [...] "certain obligations of accuracy that transcend current political benefit." [...] After Bellesiles claimed he had been flooded by hate mail, both the American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians endorsed a resolution condemning the alleged harassment. As Hoffer later wrote, Bellesiles was convinced that whether the entire profession agreed with “his stance on gun ownership (<b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> most did), surely academic historians would not let their expertise be impugned by a rank and partisan amateur like Cramer.” ...|$|E
60|$|CHARLES. Rowley my old Friend--I am {{sure you}} congratulate me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> too that I owe you much.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am growing old, <b>I</b> suppose, <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> every one. But hearken to me, {{for between}} wine and ill-temper out it must come. You saw that Alruna-woman?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{surprise}} me,' said Miss Temple; 'I {{think that}} few {{people ought to be}} unhappy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> rather <b>suspect</b> fewer are than we imagine.' ...|$|R
60|$|We {{happened}} then {{to cross the}} street, and the traffic prevented us from speaking. What Colonel MacAndrew had told me seemed very improbable, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> that Mrs. Strickland, for reasons of her own, had concealed from him {{some part of the}} facts. It was clear that a man after seventeen years of wedlock did not leave his wife without certain occurrences which must have led her to suspect that all was not well with their married life. The Colonel caught me up.|$|R
6000|$|... "I accuse nobody, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> nothing," [...] {{she broke}} out abruptly. [...] "But I cannot {{and will not}} accept the {{responsibility}} of persuading Laura to this marriage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It {{sounds a}} drastic rule. The {{trouble is that}} my {{relatives}} and friends expect too much of me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> {{that some of them}} are pulling opposite ways.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{the said}} talkative evening itself; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> {{if you will}} confess the truth, you will say that your morning's meditations are running {{very much in the}} same channel." ...|$|E
6000|$|So much of ----.[6] All that <b>I</b> know, <b>and</b> all <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> {{that is to}} be known. A kind, gentlemanly, affectionate hearted man, {{possessed of}} an {{absolute}} talent for industry. Would to God, he had never heard of Philosophy! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon, Signore. This is no shameless priest, like so {{many that}} disgrace the tonsure. Both monk and girl have {{innocent}} and harmless looks, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do <b>suspect</b> your Highness may have forgotten." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{all these}} questions, <b>and</b> especially, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> that last one, ought {{to lead the}} young student up to the great and complex question--How were these islands re-peopled with plants and animals, after the long and {{wholesale}} catastrophe of the glacial epoch? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allons, toujours des questions!" [...] says mademoiselle, {{with a shrug}} of {{her pretty}} shoulders. (Florac has {{recommended}} her to us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> the little Chevalier has himself an eye upon this pretty Mademoiselle de Blois.) ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{the mother}} and {{daughter}} had gone Mrs. Verrian said, [...] "She is a great admirer of yours, Philip. She's read your story, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> she wants {{an opportunity to talk}} with you about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As for the bumps," [...] {{replied the}} man, looking at himself with much pride, [...] "I {{was born with}} them <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> they were {{a gift from the}} fairies. They make me look rugged and big, like the {{mountain}} I serve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{observed}} how Miss Mordaunt shrunk from {{the familiarity of}} being called Miss, and how unwilling she was to let you buy the tickets; <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> was solely because she saw you had some notion of {{what you call a}} treat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{have the}} same jumble of motives <b>and</b> traditions, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> whether they are eventful or not. The brakes may be strong or weak but the drive is the same. I can't {{remember}} much of the beginnings of curiosity and knowledge in these matters. Can you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In an interview, Wolf {{said that}} {{shooting}} in Chicago {{convinced him to}} switch from film to digital. [...] "For most of my first major series Architecture of Density, I shot with a 4x5 film camera," [...] he said. [...] "But {{when it came to}} shooting Chicago—which is a very windy city—the slightest gust of wind would vibrate the tripod, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> many of my photographs would be ruined." [...] Shooting digital allowed him to review the days' images, and guaranteed the precision Wolf wanted. [...] "There’s nothing accidental in my photos," [...] he added in the same interview.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless me, how you frighten one! You look solemn as a hearse; but I {{promised to}} go with Bill to-night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> another time will do just as well. What {{you have to say}} will keep, I suppose," [...] she said mischievously.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know that," [...] {{said the}} old gentleman; [...] "you cannot tell whom they belonged to, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> Government would claim them, if--But, by the way, I suppose you found no letters--nothing {{in the shape of}} writing on the body?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know very}} much. Your {{throwing}} out the wine gave me a hint, because {{it was obvious that}} somebody had been getting after you before, and there were other matters. But you're rather young <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> you're up against a big thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{still thought}} his pity {{was not quite}} genuine, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> still <b>suspected</b> an unaccountable sneer under all this, until he said, as we were parted, like the other knots of talkers, by the {{announcement}} of dinner: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I didn't know you; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't {{especially}} {{want to know}} you. Not that I bear grudges, understand, although you've {{been little}} of a friend to my folks these past years. But you are rich <b>and</b> proud--and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> you're a little cross, Aunt Jane--while we are poor and proud and like to live our lives in our own way." ...|$|R
60|$|I lost my poem somewhere {{about the}} house, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> soon <b>suspected</b> that my uncle had found it; as he harshly intimated {{to me that}} I could return home, <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> need not come and see him again until he should send for me.|$|R
