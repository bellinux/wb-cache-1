50|$|The next generation, the RP25 Sovereign II, {{was very}} {{similarly}} styled, with the external differences being most noticeable {{on the top}} panel. This model was available in charcoal black and blue. The audio and AM sections were identical to the third-generation Herald, and the FM sections were a new design with the FM front end now made in-house; the FM and audio sections went on {{to appear in the}} RP37 VHF Herald. Initially, AF117s were used in the <b>AM</b> <b>tuner,</b> but from serial number 13001, BF194/195s were adopted (the FM sections used these silicon devices from the outset). This set introduced an ISM (inter-station muting) function for the FM band, operated by a switch that also enabled the AFC function, which eliminates the loud noises typically heard when tuning across the FM band. There are now four station markers, which can be placed anywhere within the band (which still only reached 101 MHz).|$|E

40|$|Rotary and {{displacement}} <b>tuners</b> <b>are</b> {{described for}} multistub superconducting rf resonators. The {{effectiveness of these}} <b>tuners</b> <b>is</b> made possible because the resonators have low currents between their outer conductors and tuner elements. Computer simulations and experimental data show that the devices provide a tuning range up to 100  kHz with a frequency resolution of about 1  Hz. As well, only a small driving force is required allowing use of a low-backlash drive mechanism. The use of the rotary <b>tuner</b> <b>is</b> limited to the resonators with two loading elements such as the 2 -stub quarter wave resonator, the conventional split loop resonator, and the 2 -stub, half wave resonator. The displacement <b>tuner</b> <b>is</b> more versatile {{and can be used}} for any TEM-like quarter wave resonator or half wave resonator resonators with two or more loading elements...|$|R
