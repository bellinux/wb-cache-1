2500|$|If the {{separation}} distance {{is equal to}} the sum of the focal lengths (d = f1+f2), the FFL and BFL are infinite. This corresponds to a pair of lenses that transform a parallel (collimated) beam into another collimated beam. This type of system is called an <b>afocal</b> system, since it produces no net convergence or divergence of the beam. Two lenses at this separation form the simplest type of optical telescope.

2500|$|In 1888, German {{ophthalmologist}} Adolf Gaston Eugen Fick {{constructed and}} fitted {{the first successful}} contact lens. While working in Zürich, he described fabricating <b>afocal</b> scleral contact shells, which rested on the less sensitive rim of tissue around the cornea, and experimentally fitting them; initially on rabbits, then on himself, and lastly on {{a small group of}} volunteers. These lenses were made from heavy blown glass and were [...] in diameter. Fick filled the empty space between cornea and glass with a dextrose solution. He published his work, [...] "Contactbrille", in the journal Archiv für Augenheilkunde in March 1888.|$|E
50|$|<b>Afocal</b> photography, {{also called}} <b>afocal</b> imaging or <b>afocal</b> {{projection}} {{is a method}} of photography where the camera with its lens attached is mounted over the eyepiece of another image forming system such as an optical telescope or optical microscope, with the camera lens taking {{the place of the}} human eye.|$|E
50|$|<b>Afocal</b> {{systems are}} used in laser optics, for {{instance}} as beam expanders, Infrared and forward looking infrared systems, camera zoom lenses and telescopic lens attachments such as teleside converters, and photography setups combining cameras and telescopes (<b>Afocal</b> photography).|$|E
50|$|When {{the camera}} lens is not removed (or cannot be removed) a common method used is <b>afocal</b> photography, also called <b>afocal</b> projection. In this method both the camera lens and the {{telescope}} eyepiece are attached. When both are focused at infinity the light path {{between them is}} parallel (<b>afocal),</b> allowing the camera to basically photograph anything the observer can see. This method works well for capturing images of the moon and brighter planets, as well as narrow field images of stars and nebulae. <b>Afocal</b> photography was common with early 20th century consumer level cameras, since many models had non-removable lenses. It has grown in popularity {{with the introduction of}} point and shoot digital cameras since most models also have non-removable lenses.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Afocal</b> {{photography}} {{is a form}} of astrophotography long practiced by astronomers. <b>Afocal</b> setups with film and digital cameras are not the preferred system for astrophotography since astrophotographers have many ways of coupling a camera to an astronomical telescope, the simplest being prime focus (using no camera lens and allowing the image to fall directly onto the film, or image plane of a digital single-lens reflex camera or purpose built astronomical CCD camera). Almost from their invention amateur astronomers were adapting compact digital still and video cameras for use in <b>afocal</b> astrophotography.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origins of}} the {{activity}} called Digiscoping {{has been attributed to}} the photographic methods of Laurence Poh, a birdwatcher from the Malaysian Nature Society, who discovered in 1999 almost by accident that the new generation of point and shoot digital cameras could be held up to the eyepiece of a standard spotting scope and achieve surprisingly good results. He spread his findings through birding internet discussion forums and one member, French birdwatcher Alain Fossé, coined the name “digiscoping” to describe the technique. Laurence Poh is sometimes credited with [...] "inventing" [...] the technique although his contribution may be more along the lines of popularizing the idea and refining the technology. Using a camera with its lens attached at the eyepiece of optical devices such as microscopes or telescopes, creating an <b>afocal</b> system (technically called <b>afocal</b> photography or <b>afocal</b> projection) has been used for nearly 100 years and digital camera <b>afocal</b> photography was already being employed in the amateur astronomical community. This form of <b>afocal</b> photography is now becoming more common in general photography with the spread of point and shoot digital cameras [...] because of the ease of use of this type of setup. An industry has sprung up selling couplers and other devices for mounting digital cameras afocally.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Afocal</b> {{photography}} {{works with}} any {{system that can}} produce a virtual image of parallel light, for example telescopes and microscopes. <b>Afocal</b> photographic setups work because the imaging device’s eyepiece produces collimated light and with the camera's lens focused at infinity, creating an <b>afocal</b> system with no net convergence or divergence in the light path between the two devices. In this system the device {{is focused on the}} object and the camera is placed above the eyepiece as close as possible. The drawback is the system will have a high focal ratio, with a correspondingly dim image, and some vignetting. A high focal ratio also means the field of view will be narrow. Field of view can be calculated using: ...|$|E

50|$|One {{method of}} <b>afocal</b> {{photography}} is {{to mount a}} camera with its lens attached behind the eyepiece an Keplerian optical telescope, the combination giving the photographer a long focus lens. Historically <b>afocal</b> photography with 35 mm SLR or large format film cameras {{was a very difficult}} method of photography. With film cameras the bulk and mechanical shake had to be taken into consideration, with some setups employing a separate tripod for the camera (adding the complexity of setting up the camera in relationship to the eyepiece). The general difficulties of focus and exposure with film cameras, along with the detailed mathematical calculations, combined with the time lag of waiting for the film to be developed, made film <b>afocal</b> photography challenging.|$|E

50|$|Since <b>afocal</b> {{attachments}} are not {{an integral}} part of the main lens' formula, they degrade image quality and are not appropriate for critical applications. However, they have been available for amateur motion picture, video and still cameras since the 1950s. Before the zoom lens, <b>afocal</b> attachments were a way to provide a cheap sort of interchangeable lens system to an otherwise fixed lens camera. In the zoom lens era, they are a cheap way to extend the reach of a zoom.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>afocal</b> attachments, {{such as the}} Zeiss Tele-Mutar 1.5× and Wide-Angle-Mutar 0.7× (1963, West Germany) {{for various}} fixed lens Franke and Heidecke Rolleiflex brand 120 roll film twin-lens reflex cameras, were of higher quality and price, but still not equal to true {{interchangeable}} lenses in image quality. The very bulky Mutars could change a Rolleiflex 3.5E/C's Heidosmat 75mm f/2.8 and Zeiss Planar 75mm f/3.5 (1956, West Germany) viewing and imaging lenses into 115mm and 52mm equivalents. <b>Afocal</b> attachments are still available for digital point-and-shoot cameras.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: A simple {{zoom lens}} system. The three lenses of the <b>afocal</b> system are L1, L2, L3 (from left). L1 and L2 can {{move to the}} left and right, {{changing}} the overall focal length of the system (see image below).|$|E
50|$|In <b>afocal</b> systems {{an object}} ray {{parallel}} to the optical axis is conjugate to an image ray {{parallel to the}} optical axis. Such systems have no focal points (hence <b>afocal)</b> and also lack principal and nodal points. The system is focal if an object ray parallel to the axis is conjugate to an image ray that intersects the optical axis. The intersection of the image ray with the optical axis {{is the focal point}} F' in image space. Focal systems also have an axial object point F such that any ray through F is conjugate to an image ray parallel to the optical axis. F is the object space focal point of the system.|$|E
50|$|While the {{negative}} lens L2 {{moves from the}} front {{to the back of}} the lens, the lens L1 moves forward and then backward in a parabolic arc. In doing so, the overall angular magnification of the system varies, changing the effective focal length of the complete zoom lens. At each of the three points shown, the three-lens system is <b>afocal</b> (neither diverging or converging the light), and hence does not alter the position of the focal plane of the lens. Between these points, the system is not exactly <b>afocal,</b> but the variation in focal plane position can be small enough (about ±0.01 mm in a well-designed lens) not to make a significant change to the sharpness of the image.|$|E
5000|$|He {{recognized}} {{also that}} he could correct the spherical aberration of the telescope by using aspherical mirrors {{and that in the}} particular case of the <b>afocal</b> arrangement he could do this correction by using two parabolic mirrors, though a hyperboloid is required.|$|E
50|$|George Dollond (10 June 1774 - 30 November 1852) was an English {{optician}} who constructed optical precision instruments used in astronomy, geodesy {{and also}} in navigation. Together with Peter Barlow, he also invented an <b>afocal</b> system to extend the focal length of telescopes, called the Barlow lens.|$|E
5000|$|In optics an <b>afocal</b> system (a {{system without}} focus) is an optical system that {{produces}} no net convergence or divergence of the beam, i.e. has an infinite effective focal length. This {{type of system}} can be created {{with a pair of}} optical elements where the distance between the elements is equal to the sum of each element's focal length (d = f1+f2). A simple example of an <b>afocal</b> optical system is an optical telescope imaging a star, the light entering the system is at infinity and the image it forms is at infinity (the light is collimated). Although the system does not alter the divergence of a collimated beam, it does alter the width of the beam, increasing magnification. The magnification of such a telescope is given by ...|$|E
50|$|The {{advent of}} digital single-lens reflex camera and, moreover, compact {{point and shoot}} digital cameras has made the <b>afocal</b> method far more popular since this type of camera is small enough to mount {{directly}} on to telescopes or other devices, is {{for the most part}} a solid state device with minimal moving parts, has auto focus, has auto exposure adjustment, has some capacity for time exposure, usually has a zoom mechanism to crop vignetting, and has a digital viewframe that allows the user to see the image hitting the viewing plane. Couplers and other devices for mounting digital cameras afocally are commercially available. Simply holding the camera up to the eyepiece and snapping a picture can obtain usable results. Most popular types of consumer digital cameras have non-removable lenses so <b>afocal</b> photography is also the only method available for these types of cameras.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{scheme for}} a zoom lens divides the {{assembly}} into two parts: a focusing lens {{similar to a}} standard, fixed-focal-length photographic lens, preceded by an <b>afocal</b> zoom system, an arrangement of fixed and movable lens elements that does not focus the light, but alters {{the size of a}} beam of light travelling through it, and thus the overall magnification of the lens system.|$|E
50|$|In 1888, he {{constructed}} and fitted {{what was to}} be considered the first successful model of a contact lens: an <b>afocal</b> scleral contact shell made from heavy brown glass, which he tested first on rabbits, then on himself, and lastly on a small group of volunteers. It was considered the first successful model of a contact lens. His idea was advanced independently by several innovators in the years that followed.|$|E
50|$|Zoom and superzoom lenses are {{commonly}} used with still, video, motion picture cameras, projectors, some binoculars, microscopes, telescopes, telescopic sights, and other optical instruments. In addition, the <b>afocal</b> part of a zoom lens {{can be used as}} a telescope of variable magnification to make an adjustable beam expander. This can be used, for example, to change the size of a laser beam so that the irradiance of the beam can be varied.|$|E
5000|$|Photography {{has always}} been a part of birding, but in the past the cost of cameras with super-telephoto lenses made this a minority, often semi-professional, interest. The advent of {{affordable}} digital cameras, which can be used in conjunction with a spotting scope or binoculars (using the technique of <b>afocal</b> photography, referred to by the neologism [...] "digiscoping" [...] or sometimes digibinning for binoculars), have made this a much more widespread aspect of the hobby.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{development}} of compact digital cameras, <b>afocal</b> photography is also widely used by birdwatchers, naturalists, and other photographers. In the birdwatching community it quickly acquired the coined name of “digiscoping”. Birdwatchers and naturalists found a digital camera used afocally with a spotting scope to be a particularly effective technique since it gave them {{an easy way to}} record their subjects (sometimes by simply holding the camera up to the eyepiece) as well as allowing them to take relatively high quality photographs. Since these types of photographs are usually single subjects (narrow field) in daylight hours, the light loss and narrow angle of view are not a hindrance, and the high effective focal lengths are beneficial. It also facilitates the use of a very long lens without buying and transporting extra equipment, other than perhaps a small <b>afocal</b> adapter. [...] This technique has lent itself to many other types of photography including photographing plants (for example, wild orchids growing in the canopy of a jungle), insects (for example, wild bees near their beehive), other shy or dangerous wild animals, or details in old buildings (for example, statues/gargoyles on the roof of old churches/castles).|$|E
5000|$|But {{since most}} {{celestial}} objects require a long exposure, compact consumer digital cameras are somewhat problematic {{due to their}} high inherent sensor noise. This noise limits their usefulness, especially since point-objects, such as stars, can be obscured by even one [...] "hot" [...] pixel. The narrow field of view {{for this type of}} photography lends itself to lunar and planetary objects. Continuing advancements in digital camera and image manipulation have somewhat overcome this limitation and digital <b>afocal</b> astrophotography has become more popular.|$|E
5000|$|These {{types of}} lenses are used on cameras which lack the {{facility}} {{to change the}} primary lens and therefore cannot accept a standard rear mount teleconverter, such as consumer and [...] "prosumer" [...] video cameras and camcorders, bridge cameras, point-and-shoot cameras and some older consumer medium format cameras. Some camera models have specifically designed teleside converters. Since teleside converters are <b>afocal</b> they can be mounted universally on almost any camera lens via adapter rings designed to fit the filter ring of the camera's primary lens.|$|E
50|$|A {{different}} type of teleconverter called a teleside converter can be mounted {{on the front of}} the camera's lens rather than between the primary lens and the camera body. These are popular with users of video cameras and bridge cameras with fixed lenses, as they represent the only way to add more reach to such a camera. They are usually <b>afocal</b> lenses that do not reduce the brightness of the image, but are more likely to add aberrations to the image, independent of the quality of the main lens.|$|E
50|$|In {{this simple}} {{optically}} compensated zoom lens, the <b>afocal</b> system {{consists of two}} positive (converging) lenses of equal focal length (lenses L1 and L3) with a negative (diverging) lens (L2) between them, with an absolute focal length {{less than half that}} of the positive lenses. Lens L3 is fixed, but lenses L1 and L2 can be moved axially in a particular non-linear relationship. This movement is usually performed by a complex arrangement of gears and cams in the lens housing, although some modern zoom lenses use computer-controlled servos to perform this positioning.|$|E
50|$|An <b>afocal</b> {{attachment}} is a {{more sophisticated}} supplementary lens. It is a so-called Galilean telescope accessory mounted {{to the front of}} a lens that alters the lens' effective focal length without moving the focal plane. There are two types: the telephoto and the wide angle. The telephoto type is a front positive plus rear negative cell combination that increases the image size; the wide angle has a front negative and rear positive arrangement to reduce the image size. Both have cell separation equal to cell focal length difference to maintain the focal plane.|$|E
