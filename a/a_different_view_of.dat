25|$|Given {{the serious}} {{consequences}} that plagiarism has for students, {{there has been}} a call for a greater emphasis on learning in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism. This is especially important when students move to a new institution that may have <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the concept when compared with the view previously developed by the student. Indeed, given the seriousness of plagiarism accusations for a student's future, the pedagogy of plagiarism education may need to be considered ahead of the pedagogy of the discipline being studied. The need for plagiarism education extends to academic staff, who may not completely understand what is expected of their students or the consequences of misconduct.|$|E

Fewer than 2% of the listed buildings in Wales are in this category. It was given this status on 5 April 1971, because it is [...] "a very rare example of a virtually unrestored Medieval church of simple, rustic character." [...] Cadw (the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also note as a reason for listing [...] "the retention of a complete set of 18th century fittings, including simple benches", although this comment predates the 1990s vandalism.

[...] Trumpeter Miles Davis had <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the session: in a 1964 Down Beat blind listening test, he criticised the record company for putting the three musicians together, saying that [...] "Max and Mingus can play together, by themselves.

500|$|Adam LaClave and Paul Meany {{were the}} primary songwriters for Earthsuit. As Christians, the two wrote lyrics that often communicated a Christian message.

[...] "Whitehorse" [...] was written to present <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the return of Jesus, as LaClave stated in an interview, [...] "Most people, when they hear the term [...] "white horse," [...] think of the analogy of Jesus coming back ... wanted to bring a different meaning to it, because ... He comes to rescue us in our everyday life [...]" [...] The men's lyrics also reflect experiences they have had. Meany once had a dream that inspired him to write [...] "Gummy Buffalo"; {{he found himself in}} a candy store and squeezed a gummy buffalo whereupon he heard the melody for the song. Christianity Today has proposed the lyrics in [...] "Foreign" [...] may have been inspired by their departure from Sparrow Records.

The American poet John Lundberg said that the poem was a [...] "surprising success", adding that not only was it [...] "accessible" [...] and [...] "a fitting tribute to those who served in World War I," [...] but also [...] "simply a damn good poem with rich imagery, cinematic movement and poignant ending."
