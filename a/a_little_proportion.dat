The February 2001 earthquake took place in the Ilopango – San Vicente segment of this fault zone. In this work we show new morphotectonical evidences, that support the hypothesis that this segment is highly active, and accommodates an important amount of deformation. The pattern of the fluvial network, and the features that the Jiboa river shows along its trace, allows us to estimate minimum accommodated dipslip and strike-slip motions. The amounts estimated are 100 m and 1500 m respectively for dip-slip and strike-slip, which confirms that the characteristic event type for this fault is an strike-slip event with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>proportion</b> of dip-slip.

40|$|Abstract: A {{questionnaire}} survey was undertaken {{to identify the}} current status of respirator usage in manufacturing work environments subject to gas/vapor chemicals exposure in Korea and to suggest improvements to enhance the effectiveness of respirator usage. The number of target companies included 17 big companies, 110 small & mid-size companies, and 5 foreign companies, and the number of respondents included 601 workers and 69 persons in charge of respirators (PCR). The results explained clearly that respirator programs in practice were extremely poor in small & mid-sized companies. The findings indicated that the selection of respirators was not appropriate. Quarter mask including filtering facepiece was the most common facepiece form for respirator and was worn by sixty-four percent. Not <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>proportion</b> of respondents (33 %) complained about the fit: faceseal leakage between the face and facepiece. A filtering facepiece with carbon fiber filter was used as a substitution for a gas/vapor respirator. Another result was that the PCR respondents ’ perception of the administration of respirators was very low. The results of this survey suggest that regal enforcement of respiratory protection programs should be established in Korea. On the basis of these findings, respiratory protection programs should include respirator selection, maintenance, training, and fit testing...|$|E

Graduate Education Programme in Medicine in Mexico is divided into 2 major categories: Medical Specialty and Master studies/Doctor of Philosophy. The objective {{of this study was}} to demonstrate the importance of master's degrees and Doctor of Philosophy in general surgery. Material and methodsA literature search in PubMed and Medline among others, from 1970 to 2015 with subsequent analysis of the literature reviews found. DiscussionThe physicians who conducted doctoral studies stand out as leaders in research, teaching and academic activities. Dual training with a doctorate medical specialty is a significant predictor for active participation in research projects within the best educational institutions. ResultsIt is important to study a PhD in the education of doctors specialising in surgery, who show more training in teaching, research and development of academic activities. Currently, although there is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>proportion</b> of students who do not finish the doctoral programme, the ones who do are expected to play an important role in the future of medical scientific staff. It has been shown that most doctors with Doctor of Philosophy have wide range of career options.

The factors considered are process parameters, selection of materials and environment. At first, the material composites were compounded and tensile tested to see their strength. Then, an experimental design was performed to observe the influence of process parameters. As a final test the materials obtained from compounding with mineral C were placed under a specific environment to imbibe moisture and then to see how they effect on weld line strength. In one of those material composites compounded, the ‘mineral A’ was used in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>proportion</b> to the whole mixture. The results obtained from the tensile test were examined and compared with mineral B, since it is the general material used in present industrial application. From the comparisons and results it was found that strength of mineral A is relatively equal with respect to mineral B. Finally, the effects of environment on weld line were observed using the mineral C. Experiments carried out for the fracture failure of dogbones. The notches present in the samples failed at low stress at break values and the notched samples of mineral A and mineral B were compared in this test. After all tests, mineral A has been more favourable besides mineral B. Also ‘mineral A’ can be a potential mineral for this application in the industry. + 4676195525...|$|E

Seasonally flooding and iron reduction are significant environmental processes of paddy soil. They {{may influence the}} fractionation of cooper (Cu) in paddy soil. In this study, an anaerobic incubation experiment was conducted to simulate the anaerobic environment of flooded paddy soil. The fractionations of native and spiked Cu in paddy soil were determined using a modified sequential extraction procedure (SEP) method. The effects of flooding time on Cu fractions were determined. The effects of ferrihydrite on Cu fractions were also investigated to understand the interaction between Cu contamination and iron reduction process. The {{results showed that the}} native Cu in soil were most in the residual and organic matter fractions, but the more available fractions, such as, the exchangeable and carbonates fractions occupied only <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>proportion.</b> After flooding, the native Cu in soil released from organic matter fraction and crystalloid ferric oxides fraction, and transferred to the easy extracted fractions, such as, amorphous ferric oxides, carbonates and exchangeable fractions. The spiked Cu was easily absorbed by carbonates and organic matter in soil, but after flooding, the two fractions transferred into ferric oxides fraction, especially amorphous ferric oxides fraction. Similar phenomena were observed after adding ferrihydrite in soil except for the disposal of added 400 mg/kg Cu. The process of iron reduction was inhibited significantly by Cu contamination and the inhibition of Cu contamination to iron reduction decreased after adding ferrihydrite. The transformation of Cu fractions had significant relation to the process of iron anaerobic reduction in paddy soil...|$|E

Valves of the capitulum and scales of the peduncle, coloured (after having been in spirits,) reddish-orange. In a specimen in which the capitulum was 1.3 of an inch in length, there were three whorls of valves below the carina; in this large specimen altogether there were about eighty valves; in medium-sized specimens, the number is about the same as in P. cornucopia. The upper latus, (viewed internally,) has an area about twice as large as that latus, which corresponds to the interspace between the carina and terga; whereas in P. cornucopia the upper latus is only slightly larger than this same valve. The apex of the basal internal margin of the carina is here rounded, instead of being square, as is generally the case with P. cornucopia. The strong membranous margin of the orifice of the sack, in its upper part, is almost one third as wide as the widest part of the terga, whereas in P. cornucopia it is only one fourth of this same width. The peduncle apparently is rather longer, compared with P. cornucopia, and the calcareous scales on it perhaps <b>a</b> <b>little</b> larger in <b>proportion.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Apart from François Leguat's rather simple depiction, {{the life}} {{appearance}} of the Rodrigues solitaire is only known {{from a handful of}} descriptions; no soft-tissue remains survive. Leguat devoted three pages of his memoirs to the Rodrigues solitaire, and was clearly impressed by the bird. He described its appearance as follows: [...] Of all the Birds in the Island the most remarkable is that which goes by the name of the solitary, because it is very seldom seen in company, tho' there are abundance of them. The Feathers of the Males are of a brown grey Colour: the Feet and Beak are like a Turkey's, but <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more crooked. They have scarce any Tail, but their Hind-part covered with Feathers is roundish, like the Crupper rump of a horse; they are taller than Turkeys. Their Neck is straight, and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer in <b>proportion</b> than a Turkey's when it lifts up his Head. Its Eye is Black and lively, and its Head without Comb or Cop. They never fly, their Wings are too little to support the Weight of their Bodies; they serve only to beat themselves, and flutter when they call one another. They will whirl about for twenty or thirty times together on the same side, during the space of four or five minutes. The motion of their Wings makes then a noise very like that of a Rattle; and one may hear it two hundred Paces off. The Bone of their Wing grows greater towards the Extremity, and forms <b>a</b> <b>little</b> round Mass under the Feathers, as big as a Musket Ball. That and its Beak are the chief Defence of this Bird. 'Tis very hard to catch it in the Woods, but easie in open Places, because we run faster than they, and sometimes we approach them without much Trouble. From March to September they are extremely fat, and taste admirably well, especially while they are young, some of the Males weigh forty-five Pounds. Several of Leguat's observations were later confirmed through study of subfossil Rodrigues solitaire remains. The curved contour lines of the pelvis also support the roundness of its hind parts, which he compared to that of a horse. Also, a ridged surface appears {{at the base of the}} beak, indicating the position of the caruncular ridge, which Leguat described as a [...] "widow's peak". Before fossils of the carpal knob were found, Strickland noted that the keel of the sternum of the Rodrigues solitaire was so well-developed as to almost indicate it had possessed the power of flight; however, since the humerus was very short he inferred that this was instead related to Leguat's claim that they used their wings for defence.|$|R
