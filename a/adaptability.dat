5|$|Samantha Martin, a {{professional}} animal trainer for films, commercials, and music videos, has claimed that rats {{are one of}} the easiest animals to train due to their <b>adaptability,</b> intelligence, and focus.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they are}} native to North America and eastern Asia, they have adapted well to {{countries}} {{in which they have}} been introduced, including Argentina and New Zealand. Their great <b>adaptability</b> may threaten endemic species and ecosystems into which they have been introduced.|$|E
5|$|In the {{circumstances}} {{it was hardly}} possible for the new king to show <b>adaptability</b> or tolerance or diplomatic skill, which are the fruit of long experience in human relationships. Confronted with a desperate and chaotic situation he met it instead with grim determination and implacable ferocity. Towards {{the end of his}} life, forfeiting the affection and loyalty even of his courtiers and family he became a lonely figure, isolated by suspicion and mistrust. But, in spite of all, the name of this great defender of the faith {{is one of the most}} memorable in Ethiopian history.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, Burnet was a {{chairman}} of the Papua New Guinea Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1962 and 1969. At the time, Papua New Guinea was an Australian territory, and Burnet had first travelled there as his son was posted there. His role on the committee allowed him to explore his interest in human biology. He was particularly interested in kuru (laughing sickness), and lobbied the Australian government to establish the Papua New Guinea Institute of Human Biology. Burnet later helped oversee the institute's contribution to the Anglo-Australian participation in the International Biological Programme in the Field of Human <b>Adaptability.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike other snakes, Naja nigricollis can {{be either}} nocturnal or diurnal {{depending}} {{on the time of}} year, geographic location, and average daytime temperature. This <b>adaptability</b> allows the snake to better regulate its body temperature and {{to gain access to the}} most abundant food sources of a particular area. It feeds primarily on small rodents, such as small rats and mice, birds, and fishes, but will also eat lizards, eggs, and other snakes.|$|E
5|$|As early Homo sapiens {{began to}} diversify the {{ecological}} zones that they inhabited during the MSA, {{the archaeological record}} associated with these zones begins to show evidence for regional continuities. These continuities are significant {{for a number of}} reasons. The expansion of Homo sapiens into various ecological zones demonstrates an ability to adapt to a variety of environmental contexts including marine environments, savanna grasslands, relatively arid deserts, and forests. This <b>adaptability</b> is reflected in MSA artifacts found in these zones. These artifacts display stylistic variability depending on zone. During the Acheulian, which spanned from 1.5 million years ago to 300 thousand years ago, lithic technology displayed incredible homogeneity throughout all ecological niches. MSA technologies, with their evidence for regional variability and continuity, represent a remarkable advance. These data have been used to support theories of social and stylistic development throughout the MSA.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham's {{explosive}} {{industrial expansion}} started earlier {{than that of}} the textile-manufacturing towns of the North of England, and was driven by different factors. Instead of the economies of scale of a low-paid, unskilled workforce producing a single bulk commodity such as cotton or wool in large, mechanised units of production, Birmingham's industrial development was built on the <b>adaptability</b> and creativity of a highly paid workforce with a strong division of labour, practising a broad variety of skilled specialist trades and producing a constantly diversifying range of products, in a highly entrepreneurial economy of small, often self-owned workshops. This led to exceptional levels of inventiveness: between 1760 and 1850 – the core years of the Industrial Revolution – Birmingham residents registered over three times as many patents as those of any other British town or city.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} are not endangered. Their {{future is}} stable {{because of their}} abundance and <b>adaptability.</b> However, specific populations are threatened due to various environmental changes. The population in the Moray Firth in Scotland is estimated to consist of around 190 individuals, and are under threat from harassment, traumatic injury, water pollution and reduction in food availability. Likewise, an isolated population in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, is in decline due to calf loss coincident {{to an increase in}} warm freshwater discharge into the fjord. Less local climate change, such as increasing water temperature may also play a role but has never been shown to be the case. One of the largest coastal populations of bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia was forecast to be stable with little variation in mortality over time (Manlik et al. 2016).|$|E
5|$|Dishonored 2 was {{released}} {{to a positive}} reception. Praised were the improvements made since the first game: the more challenging stealth, the <b>adaptability</b> of Emily and Corvo's abilities to both play styles, the art direction, the creative design of individual missions, {{the realization of the}} game's world as well as the replay-value and the artificial intelligence. Criticism was directed at the lack of focus of the overarching narrative. Aside from this, technical blunders as well as issues with the PC version were received unfavorably. Dishonored 2 won the award for Best Action/Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2016 and for Costume Design at the 2017 NAVGTR Awards.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{study was}} {{published}} that examined genetic variation among five Indian equine breeds—the Manipuri, Marwari, Spiti, Bhutia, and Zanskari. Based on analysis of microsatellite DNA, the Manipuri {{was found to}} have the greatest genetic distance from the Marwari, and a much closer genetic distance to the other three breeds. The distance from the Marwari was not only genetic, but seen in physical characteristics, particularly height and environmental <b>adaptability.</b> The physical differences were attributed to differing ancestries: the Marwari horse is closely associated with the Arabian, while the four other breeds are thought to have descended at least in part from the Tibetan pony. None of the breeds in the study were found to be closely genetically associated with the Thoroughbred.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment, most {{commonly}} known as Rawlings' Regiment in period documents, was organized in June 1776 as a specialized light infantry unit of riflemen in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. The American rifle units complemented the predominant, musket-equipped, line infantry forces of the war with their long-range marksmanship capability and were typically deployed with the line infantry as forward skirmishers and flanking elements. Scouting, escort, and outpost duties were also routine. The rifle units' battle formation {{was not nearly as}} structured as that of the line infantry units, which employed short-range massed firing in ordered linear formations. The riflemen could therefore respond with more <b>adaptability</b> to changing battle conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} expand into new environments {{throughout}} Africa and, ultimately, the world, displays a level of <b>adaptability</b> and, consequently, innovativeness that is often seen as characteristic of behavioral modernity. This, however, {{is not the only}} evidence of innovativeness that can be seen in early Homo sapiens. The development of new, regionally relevant tools, such as those used for the collection of marine resources seen at Abdur, Ethiopia, Pinnacle Point Cave, South Africa, and Blombos Cave, South Africa. The use of fire demonstrates another innovative aspect of human behavior when it is used in order to create stronger tools, such as the heated silcrete at Blombos, Howiesons Poort and Still Bay, and the heat treated bone tools from Still Bay.|$|E
5|$|The <b>adaptability</b> and {{opportunistic}} diet of the willie wagtail {{have probably}} assisted it in adapting to human habitation; it eats {{a wide variety}} of arthropods, including butterflies, moths, flies, beetles, dragonflies, bugs, spiders, centipedes, and millipedes, and has been recorded killing small lizards such as skinks and geckos in a study in Madang on Papua New Guinea's north coast. The tailbones of these lizards have been found in their faeces although it is unclear whether the whole animal was eaten or merely the tail. Either way, lizards are only a very occasional prey item forming between 1 and 3% of the total diet. Evidence from the study in Madang suggested that the willie wagtail selectively fed nestlings larger prey.|$|E
5|$|The draught section {{drivability}} test, which evaluates disposition: <b>adaptability,</b> reliability, and calmness, {{consists of}} four parts, and 0–5 points are given for each. To pass the test, the horse must score at least one point for {{each part of the}} test, and its combined score for the test must be at least 10 points. The first part examines the behaviour of the horse while it is being harnessed and loaded, then unloaded and unharnessed, and the remaining three parts evaluate the way the horse behaves when being driven. These parts often include regulation of the speed of the horse's walk, halts, turns around obstacles, and backing with a load around a corner.|$|E
5|$|The head, having {{mouthparts}} projecting {{forward or}} sometimes downturned, is usually heavily sclerotized and is sometimes very large. The eyes are compound and may display remarkable <b>adaptability,</b> {{as in the}} case of the aquatic whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae), where they are split to allow a view both above and below the waterline. Longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) and weevils have divided eyes, while many have eyes that are notched, and a few have ocelli, small, simple eyes usually farther back on the head (on the vertex); these are more common in larvae than in adults. Ocelli are found in the adult carpet beetle (Dermestidae), some rove beetles (Omaliinae), and the Derodontidae.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is a highly}} {{successful}} animal, being the most common large carnivore in Africa. Its success {{is due in part}} to its <b>adaptability</b> and opportunism; it is primarily a hunter but may also scavenge, with the capacity to eat and digest skin, bone and other animal waste. In functional terms, the spotted hyena makes the most efficient use of animal matter of all African carnivores. The spotted hyena displays greater plasticity in its hunting and foraging behaviour than other African carnivores; it hunts alone, in small parties of 2–5 individuals or in large groups. During a hunt, spotted hyenas often run through ungulate herds in order to select an individual to attack. Once selected, their prey is chased over a long distance, often several kilometres, at speeds of up to 60km/h.|$|E

25|$|Cadent houses : These are the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses. Planets {{in these}} houses {{have a lot}} to do with the subject {{developing}} their own unique talents and aptitudes; and may compensate for a lack of mutable signs, and general <b>adaptability</b> in the chart.|$|E
25|$|Three key traits {{have evolved}} in S. mutans and {{increased}} its virulence by enhancing its <b>adaptability</b> to the oral cavity: increased organic acid production, {{the capacity to}} form biofilms on the hard surfaces of teeth, {{and the ability to}} survive and thrive in a low pH environment.|$|E
25|$|Advertising of the times, {{typically}} in periodicals, stressed {{the advantages of}} bras in health and comfort over corsets and portrayed garments with shoulder supports in a mono-bosom style and with limited <b>adaptability.</b> Their major appeal was to those for whom lung function and mobility were priorities, rather than outer appearance.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{building}} was expanded in 1974 as Tange had originally envisioned, it did not act {{as a catalyst for}} the expansion of {{the building}} into a megastructure across the rest of the city. The building was criticised for forsaking the human use of the building in preference to the structure and <b>adaptability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Evaluating {{which is}} best for the cost of {{transport}} and human and environmental safety is difficult and involves a variety of factors. Rail offers greater flexibility and <b>adaptability</b> and has had fewer spill volume per Billion-Ton-Miles, but costs significantly more than pipeline transportation and, similar to pipeline, still requires additional investment.|$|E
25|$|A 7 September 2017 graphic {{released}} by the Royal Navy stressed modular <b>adaptability</b> and flexible construction of the design for export opportunities. Core requirements of the Type 31e frigate include , point defence systems, , hangar and a flight deck for Wildcat or ten tonne helicopter operated by a crew of around 100 with space for 40 more personnel.|$|E
25|$|Maintainability: Maintainability {{includes}} {{the notion of}} <b>adaptability,</b> portability and transferability (from one development team to another). Measuring and monitoring maintainability is a must for mission-critical applications where change is driven by tight time-to-market schedules {{and where it is}} important for IT to remain responsive to business-driven changes. It is also essential to keep maintenance costs under control.|$|E
25|$|Roman {{navigation}} used sexillie quarter steering oars {{which went}} in the Mediterranean through {{a long period of}} constant refinement and improvement, so that by Roman times ancient vessels reached extraordinary sizes. The strength of the steering oar lay in its combination of effectiveness, <b>adaptability</b> and simpleness. Roman quarter steering oar mounting systems survived mostly intact through the medieval period.|$|E
25|$|In {{another study}} by Scharf, the group {{brought up in}} a {{communal}} environment within a kibbutz showed less ability in coping with imagined situations of separation than those who were brought up with their families. This has far reaching implications for child attachment <b>adaptability</b> and therefore institutions like kibbutzim. These interesting kibbutz techniques are controversial with or without these studies.|$|E
25|$|Cells {{have evolved}} methods to {{perceive}} {{and respond to}} their microenvironment, thereby enhancing their <b>adaptability.</b> Cell signaling coordinates cellular activities, and hence governs the basic functions of multicellular organisms. Signaling between cells can occur through direct cell contact using juxtacrine signalling, or indirectly through the exchange of agents as in the endocrine system. In more complex organisms, coordination of activities can occur through a dedicated nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{discharge}} from the Navy, Proenneke went to school to become a diesel mechanic. The combination of his high intelligence, <b>adaptability,</b> and strong work ethic {{turned him into a}} very skilled mechanic. Though quite adept at his trade, Proenneke yielded to his love of nature and moved to Oregon to work at a sheep ranch. He moved to Shuyak Island, Alaska, in 1950.|$|E
25|$|The human body's {{ability to}} adapt to {{different}} environmental stresses is remarkable, allowing humans to acclimatize {{to a wide variety}} of temperatures, humidity, and altitudes. As a result, humans are a cosmopolitan species found in almost all regions of the world, including tropical rainforests, arid desert, extremely cold arctic regions, and heavily polluted cities. Most other species are confined to a few geographical areas by their limited <b>adaptability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Adaptation through {{exercise}} {{is a key}} principle of kinesiology that relates to improved fitness in athletes as well as health and wellness in clinical populations. Exercise is a simple and established intervention for many movement disorders and musculoskeletal conditions due to the neuroplasticity {{of the brain and}} the <b>adaptability</b> of the musculoskeletal system. Therapeutic exercise has been shown to improve neuromotor control and motor capabilities in both normal and pathological populations.|$|E
25|$|Astrologically speaking, Mercury {{represents}} {{the principles of}} communication, mentality, thinking patterns, rationality and reasoning, and <b>adaptability</b> and variability. Mercury governs schooling and education, the immediate environment of neighbors, siblings and cousins, transport over short distances, messages and forms of communication such as post, email and telephone, newspapers, journalism and writing, information gathering skills and physical dexterity. The 1st-century poet Marcus Manilius described Mercury as an inconstant, vivacious and curious planet.|$|E
