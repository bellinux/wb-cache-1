40|$|AbstractMembers of the <b>amaryllid</b> genus Brunsvigia {{appear to}} show {{considerable}} variation in pollination syndromes, but experimental {{studies have been}} limited to two species, one pollinated by sunbirds and one by moths. Here we present {{the results of a}} simple exclusion experiment designed to shed light on the pollinators of the narrowly distributed species B. gregaria. Experimental flowers were left unbagged, or were bagged during night-time only, day-time only, or both day-time and night-time. Treatments started when flowers first matured and continued until senescence, after which we counted the number of fertile seeds per capsule. Flowers in treatment groups left open during the daytime produced significantly more seeds than flowers bagged during the daytime, whereas nocturnal bagging made little difference to seed number, indicating near-complete dependence on diurnal pollinators. Based on anecdotal observations we speculate that sunbirds — specifically Nectarinia famosa and possibly Cinnyris afer — are the most likely pollinators of B. gregaria...|$|R

First, in their nobleness, the lilies gave the lily of the Annunciation; the asphodels, the flower of the Elysian fields; the irids, the fleur-de-lys of chivalry; and the <b>amaryllids,</b> Christ's lily of the field; while the rush, trodden always under foot, became the emblem of humility. Then take each of the tribes, and consider the extent of their lower influence. Perdita's [...] "The crown imperial, lilies of all kinds," [...] are the first tribe, which, giving the type of perfect purity in the Madonna's lily, have, by their lovely form, influenced the entire decorative design of Italian sacred art; while ornament design of war was continually enriched by the curves of the triple petals of the Florentine [...] "giglio," [...] and French fleur-de-lys; so {{that it is impossible to}} count their influence for good in the middle ages, partly as a symbol of womanly character, and partly of the utmost brightness and refinement of chivalry in the city which was the flower of cities.|$|E
6000|$|... 81. So, now, observe, you are {{to divide}} the whole family of the herbs of the field into three great groups,--Drosidæ, Carices,* Gramineæ,-- dew-plants, sedges, and grasses. Then the Drosidæ are divided into five great orders: lilies, asphodels, <b>amaryllids,</b> irids, and rushes. No tribes of flowers have had so great, so varied, or so healthy an {{influence}} on man as this great group of Drosidæ, depending, {{not so much on}} the whiteness of some of their blossoms, or the radiance of others, as on the strength and delicacy of the substance of their petals; enabling them to take forms of faultless elastic curvature, either in cups, as the crocus, or expanding bells, as the true lily, or heath-like bells, as the hyacinth, or bright and perfect stars, like the star of Bethlehem, or, when they are affected by the strange reflex of the serpent nature which forms the labiate group of all flowers, closing into forms of exquisitely fantastic symmetry in the gladiolus. Put by their side their Nereid sisters, the water-lilies, and you have them in the origin of the loveliest forms of ornamental design, and the most powerful floral myths yet recognized among human spirits, born by the streams of Ganges, Nile, Arno, and Avon.|$|E
6000|$|... 84. It is {{impossible}} to bring into any tenable compass for our present purpose, even hints of the human influence of the two remaining orders of <b>Amaryllids</b> and Irids; only note this generally, that while these in northern countries share with the Primulas the fields of spring, it seems that in Greece, the primulaceæ are not an extended tribe, while the crocus, narcissus, and Amaryllis lutea, the [...] "lily of the field" [...] (I suspect also that the flower whose name we translate [...] "violet" [...] was in truth an iris) represented to the Greek the first coming of the breath {{of life on the}} renewed herbage; and became in his thoughts the true embroidery of the saffron robe of Athena. Later in the year, the dianthus (which, though belonging to an entirely different race of plants, has yet a strange look of being made out of the grasses by turning the sheath-membrane at the root of their leaves into a flower) seems to scatter, in multitudinous families, its crimson stars far and wide. But the golden lily and crocus, together with the asphodel, retain always the old Greek's fondest thoughts,--they are only [...] "golden" [...] flowers that are to burn on the trees, and float on the streams of paradise.|$|E

50|$|Since then {{seven of}} Linnaeus' genera have {{consistently}} {{been placed in}} a common taxonomic unit of <b>amaryllids,</b> based on the inferior position of the ovaries (whether this be as an order, suborder, family, subfamily, tribe or section).

50|$|In the post-Darwinian era the <b>amaryllids</b> {{were mainly}} treated {{as part of}} a very large Liliaceae family, {{although}} the early twentieth century saw increasing doubts about the inclusion of many of its components, particularly the alliaceous (i.e. Allioideae) elements. Hutchinson also suggested that the elements now included in Amaryllidoideae's parent family (Amaryllidaceae) could all be placed in one family, although only Cronquist placed all the elements into a very large Liliaceae.|$|E
50|$|Amaryllidoideae (Amaryllidaceae s.s., <b>amaryllids)</b> is a {{subfamily}} of monocot {{flowering plants}} in the family Amaryllidaceae, order Asparagales. The most recent APG classification, APG III, takes a broad view of the Amaryllidaceae, which then has three subfamilies, {{one of which is}} Amaryllidoideae (the old family Amaryllidaceae), and the others are Allioideae (the old family Alliaceae) and Agapanthoideae (the old family Agapanthaceae). The subfamily consists of about seventy genera, with over eight hundred species, and a worldwide distribution.|$|E
50|$|By {{contrast}} to {{other members of}} Pandanales the family demonstrates stricter flower morphology. Despite that, the flower structure is still quite variable and {{with a lot of}} specifics. Thus morphological analyses are not able to uncover realistic phylogenetical relationships neither appropriate taxonomy. Embryological development places the family among the <b>amaryllids</b> while the composition of the ovary puts it near the distinct Hypoxidaceae. However, a study regarding the pollen structure in two genera from Velloziaceae was found to be an important character and suggests some correlation but this is still a variable trait.|$|E
50|$|In 1819, William Herbert was {{the first}} to use Leopoldia as the name of a genus; it was {{proposed}} as a provisional name (nomen provisorium) for the genus he later (in 1821) called Hippeastrum.

In 1970, Fabio Garbari and Werner Greuter proposed that Parlatore's Leopoldia should be conserved and Herbert's Leopoldia rejected. This was accepted and Leopoldia Parl. is now a conserved name (nomen conservandum), and so the correct name for the genus described here.|$|E

On few estates has the autumnal colouring of deciduous tress been so cleverly used by harmony and contrast, as, for instance, in the planting of Norway maples and glaucous Atlantic cedars." ...|$|E
5000|$|By 1846, in {{his final}} scheme Lindley had greatly {{expanded}} and refined {{the treatment of the}} monocots, introducing both an intermediate ranking (Alliances) and tribes within families. Lindley placed the Liliaceae within the Liliales, but saw it as a paraphyletic ("catch-all") family, being all Liliales not included in the other orders, but hoped that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better. This kept the Liliaceae separate from the Amaryllidaceae (Narcissales Alliance). Of these Liliaceae was divided into eleven tribes (with 133 genera) and Amaryllidaceae into four tribes (with 68 genera), yet both contained many genera that would eventually segregate to each other's contemporary orders (Liliales and Asparagales respectively). The Liliaceae would be reduced to a small 'core' represented by the Tulipeae tribe (18 genera), while large groups such Scilleae and Asparagae would become part of Asparagales either as part of the Amaryllidaceae or as separate families. While of the four tribes of the Amaryllidaceae, the Amaryllideae and Narcissea would remain as core <b>amaryllids</b> while the Agaveae would be part of Asparagaceae, but the Alstroemeriae would become a family within the Liliales. [...] Since then, seven of Linnaeus' Hexandria monogynia genera have consistently been placed in a common taxonomic unit of <b>amaryllids,</b> based on the inferior position of the ovaries (whether this be as an order, suborder, family, subfamily, tribe or section). Thus, much of what we now consider Amaryllidaceae remained in Liliaceae because the ovary was superior, till 1926 when John Hutchinson transferred them to Amaryllidaceae. This usage of the family entered the English language literature through the work of Samuel Frederick Gray (1821), William Herbert (1837) and John Lindley (1830, 1846). Meanwhile, Lindley had described two Chilean genera which for which he created a new family, Gilliesieae.|$|E
50|$|The {{agapanthus}} subfamily of the Amaryllidaceae {{sensu lato}} is treated in some systems {{as a separate}} family, the Agapanthaceae. Agapanthus, native to South Africa, is the sole genus of the subfamily. They are relatively robust herbaceous perennials with short rhizomes and leaves forming a rosette, individually linear-oblong, flat, rather fleshy. The flowers are quite large, blue or white, forming an umbel {{at the end of}} a stem (scape) which is longer than the leaves. The inflorescences are protected by bracts joined together along one side. The ovary is superior. Plants do not have the characteristic garlic odor of the allium subfamily (Allioideae). They are set apart from the amaryllis subfamily (Amaryllidoideae) by their superior ovary, the presence of saponins and the absence of the alkaloids typical of <b>amaryllids.</b> Agapanthus is widely grown as an ornamental in temperate gardens.|$|E

50|$|Herbert's main {{role was}} in untangling {{a number of}} {{distinct}} genera that Linnaeus had included under Amaryllis. Although in Herbert's description of Nerine rosea there, he attempted to distinguish it from N. sarniensis, the former is now accepted as a synonym of the latter, the accepted name. When Herbert chose the name of these nymphs for the first species of the genus, Nerine sarniensis, he alluded {{to the story of}} how this South African species arrived on the island of Guernsey in the English Channel. It is said that a ship carrying boxes of the bulbs of this species destined for the Netherlands was shipwrecked on Guernsey. The boxes of bulbs were washed up on the island and the bulbs became established and multiplied around the coast. Herbert eventually recognised nine species. At that time Amaryllis (and hence Nerine) were placed in the family Amaryllideae, following the classification of de Candolle (1813). Herbert's main interests were in the taxonomy of <b>amaryllids,</b> publishing a monograph on this in 1837, considering Amaryllideae as one of seven suborders of Amaryllidaceae. He then further subdivided this suborder into groups, placing Nerine and Amaryllis together with twelve other genera into the Amaryllidiformes. In his extensive treatment of Nerine he divided the nine species he recognised into two sections, Regulares and Distortae, of which only N. humilis and N. undulata are still in use. He had also begun a bfreeding program and described seven hybrids he had raised. His enthusiasm for the genus is evident in that he chose to illustrate the front of the book with one of his hybrids, N. mitchamiae (see illustration).|$|E
