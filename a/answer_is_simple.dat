500|$|The {{film was}} {{received}} positively {{by many people}} {{who worked in the}} safety industry, with it being reported that many of them considered it to be [...] "the most moving and hard-hitting educational film on highway grade crossing accident prevention and traffic safety in recent years." [...] It received an award at a national safety film contest. Rick Prelinger described the film as being [...] "engaging" [...] and opined that it was a [...] "skillful drama." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict branded the film as [...] "hyper somber" [...] and wrote that [...] "we learn, finally, why reckless driving, trains, and painful automotive accidents don't mix. The question everyone keeps asking is 'Why don't they look?' The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>simple.</b> They're dopes!" ...|$|E
500|$|Laurence Olivier {{was paid}} $1 million to play General Douglas MacArthur in the film. He was {{contracted}} {{for six weeks}} of filming, and received a payment of $250,000 upon signing the contract and the remainder was given in four subsequent installments. His salary came out to $50,000 per day. In addition to this fee, Olivier also received $2,500 per week for his expenses. Olivier was interviewed during the film's production and explained why he agreed {{to be part of}} its cast: [...] "People ask me why I'm playing in this picture. The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>simple.</b> Money, dear boy. I'm like a vintage wine. You have to drink me quickly before I turn sour. I'm almost used up now and I can feel the end coming. That's why I'm taking money now. I've got nothing to leave my family but the money I can make from films. Nothing is beneath me if it pays well. I've earned the right to damn well grab whatever I can in the time I've got left." ...|$|E

50|$|Once {{asked what}} he {{expected}} {{when he arrived in}} Australia, his <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>simple.</b> First he expected to save his life. Second, he soon realised that music was not a way of life in Australia in the way it was in Europe. Men generally did not attend concerts as it was considered 'sissy' - a perception that lasted until the GIs came from America.|$|R
60|$|It was not {{difficult}} {{to see that he}} was frugal, though possibly from necessity rather than taste, not sparing of effort, and had a keen eye for utility, and if that suggested the question why with such capacities he had not attained to greater comfort the <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>simple.</b> Winston had no money, and the seasons had fought against him. He had done his uttermost with the means at his disposal, and now he knew he was beaten.|$|R
60|$|If it be asked, What {{novels of}} the early type ought one to read? the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>simple.</b> Unless you want to curdle your blood by a tale of mystery and horror (in which case Mrs. Radcliffe's Mysteries of Udolpho will serve the purpose) {{there are only two}} that young readers will find satisfactory: the {{realistic}} Robinson Crusoe by Defoe, and the romantic Vicar of Wakefield by Goldsmith.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I understand. You {{expected}} to make the small pick-ups and then land the grand coup. The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>simple,</b> after all. But," [...] he added, his voice growing stern and menacing for the first time, [...] "I {{do not intend to}} be robbed, my girl. Fleece Hathaway if you can; it is none of my business; but you must not pry into my personal affairs or rifle my poor rooms. Do you understand me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>simple</b> enough, as Emily Brontë knew. They quarrel. And an {{excellent}} way of passing the time it is; so excellent, indeed, that the pity were better inverted. But we all lack the knowledge of our chiefest needs. In the first place, and mainly, it is hygienic to quarrel, it disengages floods of nervous energy, the pulse quickens, the breathing is accelerated, the digestion improved. Then it sets one's stagnant brains astir and quickens the imagination; it clears the mind of vapours, as thunder clears the air. And, finally, it is a natural function of the body. In his natural state man is always quarrelling--by instinct. Not to quarrel is indeed one of the vices of our civilisation, {{one of the reasons}} why we are neurotic and anæmic, and all these things. And, at last, our enfeebled palates have even lost the capacity for enjoying a [...] "jolly good row." ...|$|E
40|$|B. C. ’s stunningly close {{election}} result has pulled an arcane debate about parliamentary precedent {{into the public}} eye, and the whole country is watching for what will happen next. British Columbians are anxious about whether an NDP government will even {{have a chance to}} prove it can work, or whether a deadlock will create uncertainty — or worse, another election. For all the hand-wringing and hair-splitting, the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>simpler</b> than many pundits think — yes, the NDP government can govern, and parliamentary rules and conventions enable a way forward...|$|R
6000|$|I {{remembered the}} menace of the unhappy Juliet, and {{expected}} the full tempest of the man's vengeance, and the awakened wrath of his followers, to fall instantly upon me. I <b>was</b> questioned. My <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> <b>simple</b> and sincere. [...] "His own mouth condemns him," [...] exclaimed the impostor; [...] "he confesses that his {{intention was to}} seduce from the way of salvation our well-beloved sister in God; away {{with him to the}} dungeon; to-morrow he dies the death; we are manifestly called upon to make an example, tremendous and appalling, to scare the children of sin from our asylum of the saved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What," [...] she {{answered}} smiling, [...] "with this bandage round my head? Well, in your eyes, perhaps." [...] But inwardly {{she thought to}} herself that the description would be more applicable to her father, who in truth, notwithstanding his years, was wonderfully handsome, with his quick blue eyes, mobile face, gentle mouth with the wistful droop at the corners so like her own, and grey beard. How, she wondered, could this be {{the man who had}} struck her mother. Then she remembered him as he had been years before when he was a slave to liquor, and knew that the <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>simple.</b>|$|R
60|$|Here, then, is {{one point}} at which danger may be expected. The {{question}} recurs, how shall we fortify against it? The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>simple.</b> Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to his posterity, swear by {{the blood of the}} Revolution never to violate in the least particular the laws of the country, and never to tolerate their violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and the Laws let every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred honour; let every man remember that to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the charter of his own and his children's liberty. Let reverence for the laws be breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap. Let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges. Let it be written in primers, spelling-books, and in almanacs. Let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short, let it become the political religion of the nation.|$|E
6000|$|And here I stop {{to answer}} those who may say--as I have heard it said--That a woman's intellect is not fit for {{business}}; that when a woman takes to business, she is apt to do it ill, and unpleasantly likewise, to be more suspicious, more irritable, more grasping, more unreasonable, than regular men of business would be: that--as I have heard it put--"a woman does not fight fair." [...] The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>simple.</b> That a woman's intellect is eminently fitted for business is proved by the enormous amount of business she gets through without any special training for it: but those faults in a woman of which some men complain are simply the results of her not having had a special training. She does not know the laws of business. She does not know {{the rules of the}} game she is playing; and therefore she is playing it in the dark, in fear and suspicion, apt to judge of questions on personal grounds, often offending those with whom she has to do, and oftener still making herself miserable over matters of law or of business, on which a little sound knowledge would set her head and her heart at rest.|$|E
6000|$|The {{question}} recurs, [...] "How {{shall we}} fortify against it?"

5000|$|The {{maneuver}} {{that paid}} Bryan highest dividends was his fifteen months of missionary work {{in behalf of}} silver and cultivation of the Chicago delegates. He knew personally more delegates than did any other candidate ... {{and he was on}} the ground to supervise his strategy. When he spoke of himself as the nominee, some reacted as journalist Willis J. Abbot did and doubted his mental capacity. How could a boy in appearance, one not yet admitted to the convention, without a single state behind him, dare claim the nomination? The <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>simple,</b> Bryan told Abbot—he had prepared a speech that would stampede the convention.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was another}} sly attempt to trap Joan into indiscreet admissions and {{dangerous}} pretensions. But nothing came of it. Joan's <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>simple</b> and straightforward, and the smooth Bishop {{was not able}} to find any fault with it. She said that when she met with people who doubted the truth of her mission she went aside and prayed, complaining of the distrust of these, and then the comforting Voices were heard at her ear saying, soft and low, [...] "Go forward, Daughter of God, and I will help thee." [...] Then she added, [...] "When I hear that, the joy in my heart, oh, it is insupportable!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Various {{scholars}} {{have attempted to}} discover the source of Taché's words. The ethnologist Conrad Laforte has suggested that they might derive from the song , or possibly Victor Hugo's poem [...] Writer André Duval thought the <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>simpler</b> and closer at hand: In the hall of the Parliament building in which the motto is carved above the door, are {{the arms of the}} Marquess of Lorne whose motto was [...] ("Do Not Forget"). Consequently, Duval believed [...] "the motto of Quebec to be {{at the same time the}} translation of the Marquess of Lorne's motto and the answer of a French-Canadian subject of Her Majesty to the said motto." ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{if you ask}} me, How is it a {{sacrifice}} to God to confess to Him that we are sinners? the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>simple.</b> It is {{a sacrifice}} to God, and a sacrifice well-pleasing to Him, simply because it is The Truth. God wants nothing from us; we can give Him nothing. The wild beasts of the forest are His, {{and so are the}} cattle on a thousand hills. If He be hungry He will not tell us for the whole world is His and all that is therein. But what He asks is, that for our own sakes we should see the truth about ourselves, see what we really are, and sacrifice that self- conceit which prevents our seeing ourselves as God our Father sees us. [...] And why does that please God? Simply because it puts us in our right state, and in our right place, where we can begin to become better men, let us be as bad as we may. If a man be a fool, the best possible thing for him is that he should find out that he is a fool, and confess that he is a fool, as the first, and the absolutely necessary first step to becoming wise. Therefore repentance, contrition, humility, is the very foundation-stone of all goodness, virtue, holiness, usefulness; and God desires to see us contrite, simply because He desires to see us good men and good women.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Greenwood again expresses {{his views}} about this dark {{suspicious}} mystery, {{the absence of}} Shakespeare or Shakspere (or Shak, as you like it), from Henslowe's accounts, if Shak(&c.) wrote plays. But the mystery, if mystery there be, is just as obscure if the actor were the channel through which Bacon's plays reached the stage, for the pretended author of these masterpieces. Shak--was not the man {{to do all the}} troking, bargaining, lying, going here and there, and making himself a motley to the view for 0 pounds, 0s, 0d. If he were a sham, a figure-head, a liar, a fetcher-and-carrier of manuscripts, HE WOULD BE PAID FOR IT. But he did not deal with Henslowe in his bargainings, and THAT is why Henslowe does not mention him. Mr. Greenwood, in one place, {161a} agrees, so far, with me. [...] "Why did Henslowe not mention Shakespeare as the writer of other plays" [...] (than Titus Andronicus and Henry VI)? [...] "I think the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>simple</b> enough." [...] (So do I.) [...] "Neither Shakspere nor 'Shakespeare' ever wrote for Henslowe!" [...] The obvious is perceived at last; and the reason given is [...] "that he was above Henslowe's 'skyline,'" [...] "he" [...] being the Author. We only differ as to WHY the author was above Henslowe's [...] "sky-line." [...] I say, because good Will had a better market, that of his Company. I understand Mr. Greenwood to think,--because the Great Unknown was too great a man to deal with Henslowe. If to write for the stage were discreditable, to deal (unknown) with Henslowe was no more disgraceful than to deal with [...] "a cry of players"; and as (unknown) Will did the bargaining, the Great Unknown was as safe with Will in one case as in the other. If Will did not receive anything for the plays from his own company (who firmly believed in his authorship), they must have said, [...] "Will! dost thou serve the Muses and thy obliged fellows for naught? Dost thou give us two popular plays yearly,--gratis?" ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{all such}} {{criticism}} as this (and I notice it {{only because it}} expresses the feelings into which many sensible and thoughtful minds have been fashioned by infection) the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>simple</b> and straightforward. It is just as impossible to generalize granite and slate, {{as it is to}} generalize a man and a cow. An animal must be either one animal or another animal; it cannot be a general animal, or it is no animal; and so a rock must be either one rock or another rock; it cannot be a general rock, or it is no rock. If there were a creature in the foreground of a picture, of which he could not decide whether it were a pony or a pig, the Athenæum critic would perhaps affirm it to be a generalization of pony and pig, and consequently a high example of [...] "harmonious union and simple effect." [...] But I should call it simple bad drawing. And so when there are things in the foreground of Salvator of which I cannot pronounce whether they be granite or slate, or tufa, I affirm that there is in them neither harmonious union nor simple effect, but simple monstrosity. There is no grandeur, no beauty of any sort or kind; nothing but destruction, disorganization, and ruin, to be obtained by the violation of natural distinctions. The elements of brutes can only mix in corruption, the elements of inorganic nature only in annihilation. We may, if we choose, put together centaur monsters; but they must still be half man, half horse; they cannot be both man and horse, nor either man or horse. And so, if landscape painters choose, they may give us rocks which shall be half granite and half slate; but they cannot give us rocks which shall be either granite or slate, nor which shall be both granite and slate. Every attempt to produce that which shall be any rock, ends in the production of that which is no rock.|$|E

40|$|The {{discussion}} on urban green spaces {{opens up the}} old paradigmatic question {{on the relationship between}} the city and nature. At the common sense level, the <b>answers</b> <b>are</b> <b>simple</b> and one-dimensional, but a more elaborate analysis necessarily runs into the archetypical conflict relationship between “nature and culture”. The present text deals with different, more or less successful examples how to reconcile this relationship. In modern societies, people’s dissatisfaction with the mere symbolic presence of nature in the cities has had a substantial impact on suburbanisation processes, which are themselves environmentally rather problematic. The conclusion argues that the question of nature in the city should be replaced by that of the city in nature. Urban green spaces should be treated as part of the ecosystem at the regional level, not as an exclusively internal city problem...|$|R

Your {{argument}} against letting [...] the outworn hack go to grass, depends wholly {{on a certain}} [...] proposition, namely this, that there {{is about to be}} a crisis in [...] the history of the constitution, growing out of the extension of [...] the franchise, and that it is my duty to do what I can in aiding [...] to steer the ship through the boiling waters of this crisis. My [...] <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>simple.</b> There is no crisis at all in view.
