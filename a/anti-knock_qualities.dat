When {{used as a}} test fuel component in anti-knock test engines, a 100% heptane fuel is the zero point of the octane rating scale (the 100 point is a 100% iso-octane). Octane number equates to the <b>anti-knock</b> <b>qualities</b> of a comparison mixture of heptane and isooctane which is expressed {{as the percentage of}} isooctane in heptane and is listed on pumps for gasoline (petrol) dispensed globally.|$|E
40|$|Global {{concerns}} over atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) levels {{and the security}} of fossil fuel supply {{have led to the}} development of biofuels; a potentially carbon-neutral and renewable fuel strategy. One new gasoline-alternative biofuel candidate is 2, 5 -dimethylfuran (DMF). In this paper, the potential of DMF is examined in a direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) engine. Focus is given to the combustion performance and emissions sensitivity around the optimum spark timing, especially at 10 crank angle degrees retard (SR 10). Such spark retard strategies are commonly used to reduce catalyst light-off times, albeit at the cost of reduced engine performance and increased CO 2. The results for DMF are compared to gasoline, ethanol, butanol and methanol so that its sensitivity can be positioned relatively. The overall order of spark sensitivity at the highest load (8. 5 bar IMEP) was: gasoline > butanol > DMF > ethanol > methanol. The four biofuels widen the spark window due to improved <b>anti-knock</b> <b>qualities</b> and sometimes increased charge-cooling. This allows the increase of CO 2 to be better minimized than with gasoline. Furthermore, DMF is the only biofuel to produce high exhaust gas temperatures, similar to gasoline and helpful for fast catalyst light-off, whilst maintaining high combustion stabilities. This demonstrates the potentially favorable characteristics of DMF to become an effective cold-start fuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of spark ignition engines is {{highly dependent on}} fuel <b>anti-knock</b> <b>quality,</b> {{which in turn is}} governed by autoignition chemistry. In this study, we explore this chemistry for various aromatic oxygenates (i. e., anisole, 4 -methyl anisole, 4 -propyl anisole, guaiacol, 4 -methyl guaiacol, 4 -ethyl guaiacol) that can be produced from lignin, a low value residual biomass stream that is generated in paper pulping and cellulosic ethanol plants. All compounds share the same benzene ring, but have distinct oxygen functionalities and degrees of alkylation. The objective {{of this study is to}} ascertain what the impact is of said side groups on <b>anti-knock</b> <b>quality</b> and, by proxy, on fuel economy in a modern Volvo T 5 spark ignition engine. To better comprehend the variation in behavior amongst the fuels, further experiments have been conducted in a constant volume autoignition device. The results demonstrate that alkylation has a negligible impact on <b>anti-knock</b> <b>quality,</b> while the addition of functional oxygen groups manifests as a deterioration in <b>anti-knock</b> <b>quality...</b>|$|R

40|$|Increasing the <b>anti-knock</b> <b>quality</b> of {{gasoline}} fuels can enable higher efficiency in spark ignition engines. In this study, the blending <b>anti-knock</b> <b>quality</b> of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), {{a by-product of}} ethylene production from naphtha cracking, with various gasoline fuels is explored. The blends were tested in an ignition quality tester (IQT) and a modified cooperative fuel research (CFR) engine operating under homogenous charge compression ignition (HCCI) and knock limited spark advance (KLSA) conditions. Due to current fuel regulations, ethanol is widely used as a gasoline blending component in many markets. In addition, ethanol is widely used as a fuel and literature verifying its performance. Moreover, because ethanol exhibits synergistic effects, the test results of DCPD-gasoline blends were compared to those of ethanol-gasoline blends. The experiments conducted in this work enabled the screening of DCPD auto-ignition characteristics {{across a range of}} combustion modes. The synergistic blending nature of DCPD was apparent and appeared to be greater than that of ethanol. The data presented suggests that DCPD {{has the potential to be}} a high octane blending component in gasoline; one which can substitute alkylates, isomerates, reformates, and oxygenates...|$|R
50|$|The {{evaluation}} of the octane number by the two laboratory methods requires a standard engine, and the test procedure can be both expensive and time-consuming. The standard engine required for the test {{may not always be}} available, especially in out-of-the-way places or in small or mobile laboratories. These and other considerations led to the search for a rapid method for the {{evaluation of}} the <b>anti-knock</b> <b>quality</b> of gasoline. Such methods include FTIR, near infrared on-line analyzers (ASTM D-2885) and others. Deriving an equation {{that can be used for}} calculating the octane quality would also serve the same purpose with added advantages. The term Octane Index is often used to refer to the calculated octane quality in contradistinction to the (measured) research or motor octane numbers. The octane index can be of great service in the blending of gasoline. Motor gasoline, as marketed, is usually a blend of several types of refinery grades that are derived from different processes such as straight-run gasoline, reformate, cracked gasoline etc. These different grades are considered as one group when blending to meet final product specifications. Most refiners produce and market more than one grade of motor gasoline, differing principally in their <b>anti-knock</b> <b>quality.</b> The ability to predict the octane quality of the blends prior to blending is essential, something for which the calculated octane index is specially suited.|$|R
40|$|High-octane quality fuels are {{important}} for increasing spark ignition engine efficiency, but their production comes at a substantial economic and environmental cost. The possibility of producing high <b>anti-knock</b> <b>quality</b> gasoline by blending high-octane bio-derived components with low octane naphtha streams is attractive. 2 -phenyl ethanol (2 -PE), is one such potential candidate that {{can be derived from}} lignin, a biomass component made of interconnected aromatic groups. We first ascertained the blending <b>anti-knock</b> <b>quality</b> of 2 -PE by studying the effect of spark advancement on knock for various blends 2 -PE, toluene, and ethanol with naphtha in a cooperative fuels research engine. The blending octane quality of 2 -PE indicated an anti-knock behavior similar or slightly greater than that of toluene, and ethylbenzene, which could be attributed to either chemical kinetics or charge cooling effects. To isolate chemical kinetic effects, a model for 2 -PE auto-ignition was developed and validated using ignition delay times measured in a high-pressure shock tube. Simulated ignition delay times of 2 -PE were also compared to those of traditional high-octane gasoline blending components to show that the gas phase reactivity of 2 -PE is lower than ethanol, and comparable to toluene, and ethylbenzene at RON, and MON relevant conditions. The gas-phase reactivity of 2 -PE is largely controlled by its aromatic ring, while the effect of the hydroxyl group is minimal. The higher blending octane quality of 2 -PE compared to toluene, and ethylbenzene can be attributed primarily to the effect of the hydroxyl group on increasing heat of vaporization. © 2016 The Combustion Institute...|$|R
40|$|Owing to {{environmental}} and health concerns, tetraethyl lead was gradually phased {{out from the}} early 1970 's to mid- 1990 's in most developed countries. Advances in refining, leading to more aromatics (via reformate) and iso-paraffins such as iso-octane, along {{with the introduction of}} (bio) oxygenates such as MTBE, ETBE and ethanol, facilitated the removal of lead without sacrificing RON and MON. In recent years, however, legislation has been moving in the direction of curbing aromatic and olefin content in gasoline, owing to similar concerns as was the case for lead. Meanwhile, concerns over global warming and energy security have motivated research into renewable fuels. Amongst which are those derived from biomass. The feedstock of interest in this study is lignin, which, together with hemicellulose and cellulose, is amongst the most abundant organic compounds on the planet. Contrary to (hemi-) cellulose, however, which is an important constituent of feed for livestock, lignin falls completely outside of our food chain. This study was motivated by the need for renewable octane boosters of low toxicity, which improve both <b>anti-knock</b> <b>quality</b> and fuel economy under modern engines conditions. The goal {{of this study is to}} investigate on a Volvo T 5 spark ignition engine whether or not the lignin derived aromatic oxygenates, benzyl alcohol, 2 -phenyl ethanol and acetophenone, adhere to such requirements. It was found that these aromatic oxygenates have a low toxicity and improve both knock resistance and volumetric fuel economy under modern engine operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|At a first glance, ethanol, toluene and methyl tert-butyl ether look nothing alike {{with respect}} to their {{molecular}} structures. Nevertheless, all share a similarly high octane number. A comprehensive review of the inner workings of such octane boosters has been long overdue, particularly at a time when feedstocks for transport fuels other than crude oil, such as natural gas and biomass, are enjoying a rapidly growing market share. As high octane fuels sell at a considerable premium over gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, new entrants into the refining business should take note and gear their processes towards knock resistant compounds if they are to maximize their respective bottom lines. Starting from crude oil, the route towards this goal is well established. Starting from biomass or natural gas, however, it is less clear what dots on the horizon to aim for. The goal {{of this paper is to}} offer insight into the chemistry behind octane boosters and to subsequently distill from this knowledge, taking into account recent advances in engine technology, multiple generic design rules that guarantee good anti-knock performance. Careful analysis of the literature suggests that highly unsaturated (cyclic) compounds are the preferred octane boosters for modern spark-ignition engines. Additional side chains of any variety will dilute this strong performance. Multi-branched paraffins come in distant second place, owing to their negligible sensitivity. Depending on the type and location of functional oxygen groups, oxygenates can have a beneficial, neutral or detrimental impact on <b>anti-knock</b> <b>quality...</b>|$|R
40|$|Gasoline <b>anti-knock</b> <b>quality,</b> {{defined by}} the {{research}} and motor octane numbers (RON and MON), is important for increasing spark ignition (SI) engine efficiency. Gasoline knock resistance can be increased using a number of blending components. For over two decades, ethanol has become a popular anti-knock blending agent with gasoline fuels due to its production from bio-derived resources. This work explores the oxidation behavior of two oxygenated certification gasoline fuels and the variation of fuel reactivity with molecular composition. Ignition delay times of Haltermann (RON =[*] 91) and Coryton (RON =[*] 97. 5) gasolines have been measured in a high-pressure shock tube and in a rapid compression machine at three pressures of 10, 20 and 40  bar, at equivalence ratios of φ[*]=[*] 0. 45, 0. 9 and 1. 8, and in the temperature range of 650 – 1250  K. The {{results indicate that the}} effects of fuel octane number and fuel composition on ignition characteristics are strongest in the intermediate temperature (negative temperature coefficient) region. To simulate the reactivity of these gasolines, three kinds of surrogates, consisting of three, four and eight components, are proposed and compared with the gasoline ignition delay times. It is shown that more complex surrogate mixtures are needed to emulate the reactivity of gasoline with higher octane sensitivity (S = RON–MON). Detailed kinetic analyses are performed to illustrate the dependence of gasoline ignition delay times on fuel composition and, in particular, on ethanol content...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} fuels with high <b>anti-knock</b> <b>quality</b> has {{historically}} been rising, {{and will continue to}} increase with the development of downsized and turbocharged spark-ignition engines. Butanol isomers, such as 2 -butanol and tert-butanol, have high octane ratings (RON of 105 and 107, respectively), and thus mixed butanols (68. 8 % by volume of 2 -butanol and 31. 2 % by volume of tert-butanol) can be added to the conventional petroleum-derived gasoline fuels to improve octane performance. In the present work, the effect of mixed butanols addition to gasoline surrogates has been investigated in a high-pressure shock tube facility. The ignition delay times of mixed butanols stoichiometric mixtures were measured at 20 and 40 bar over a temperature range of 800 - 1200 K. Next, 10 vol% and 20 vol% of mixed butanols (MB) were blended with two different toluene/n-heptane/iso-octane (TPRF) fuel blends having octane ratings of RON 90 /MON 81. 7 and RON 84. 6 /MON 79. 3. These MB/TPRF mixtures were investigated in the shock tube conditions similar to those mentioned above. A chemical kinetic model was developed to simulate the low- and high-temperature oxidation of mixed butanols and MB/TPRF blends. The proposed model is in good agreement with the experimental data with some deviations at low temperatures. The effect of mixed butanols addition to TPRFs is marginal when examining the ignition delay times at high temperatures. However, when extended to lower temperatures (T < 850 K), the model shows that the mixed butanols addition to TPRFs causes the ignition delay times to increase and hence behaves like an octane booster at engine-like conditions. © 2015 The Combustion Institute...|$|R
