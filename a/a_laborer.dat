5|$|In the 1990s, {{a series}} of Historical Public Exposure Studies were {{conducted}} to assess past releases and public exposures. For example, the figure at right illustrates the calculated lifetime cancer risk to <b>a</b> <b>laborer</b> from the 1957 Rocky Flats fire. The key shows the cancer risk due to exposure during the 1957 event per million persons. This figure means that an outdoor laborer in the reddest part of Arvada would have roughly a two-in-a-million risk of contracting cancer (0.000002) from being outside during the 1957 fire. The original, complete figure - {{as well as many}} others showing the risks of past exposures - can be viewed in the Summary of Findings from the Historical Public Exposure Studies.|$|E
5|$|Philipp's mother, {{who never}} married, was the eighth child of {{relatively}} poor parents. Her father {{made a living}} as a driver and as <b>a</b> <b>laborer</b> in the construction business. The financial situation was always tight, and taught everyone in the family discipline and to work hard to survive. To support the family, Alma worked as an accountant and clerk. Philipp's father paid a monthly alimony of 35 Reichsmark (RM) until 1933. Initially he had to be reminded by his mother of his obligations. Philipp was baptized on 29 July 1917, taking the name Johannes Fritz, and was confirmed in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford {{was born}} on November 8, 1869 to James Calvin Rutherford and Leonora Strickland and raised in near-poverty in a Baptist farm family. Some sources list his place of birth as Boonville, Missouri, but {{according}} to his death certificate {{he was born in}} Versailles, Missouri. Rutherford developed an interest in law from the age of 16. Although his father discouraged this interest, he allowed Rutherford to go to college under the condition that he pay for <b>a</b> <b>laborer</b> to take his place on the family farm. Rutherford took out a loan and helped to pay for his law studies by working as a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman and court stenographer.|$|E

5|$|The Girl Strike Leader is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film deals with labor relations when Hal Stephens disguises himself and works in a factory he was given by his father. As <b>a</b> <b>laborer,</b> he {{falls in love with}} a young working girl named Lou and protects her against a manager. Lou leads a strike when wages are ordered to be cut by 10%, but the strikers return to work on the verge of starvation. Lou, who resists, is saved by Hal who assumes control, restores the wages and removes the previous manager.|$|E
5|$|Perieres' {{family was}} {{centered}} around Messene. His son Leucippus had several daughters, but Arsinoe was {{singled out for}} extensive treatment. To Apollo she bore Asclepius, whom Zeus killed. In a rage Apollo killed the Cyclopes, after which Zeus was about to hurl him into Tartarus when Leto interceded and arranged for Apollo to serve as <b>a</b> <b>laborer</b> for Admetus instead. Directly following the Asclepius affair comes the Ehoie of Asterodeia, the daughter of Deion. She bore Crisus and Panopeus to Phocus; the brothers did not get along, quarreling while still in the womb. Another daughter of Deion, Philonis, bore Philammon to Apollo and Autolycus to Hermes. Philammon sired Thamyris; Autolycus, the grandfather of Odysseus, was a master thief who could change the appearance of his booty to avoid detection. Autolycus' daughter Polymele, the mother of Jason, is apparently born directly preceding the Ehoie of Mestra, the daughter of Erysichthon.|$|E
5|$|Rymkus {{was born}} in Royalton, Illinois, {{the son of a}} Lithuanian {{immigrant}} coal miner who owned a small grocery store. After his father was shot and killed outside the grocery store, Rymkus and his family moved to the Back of the Yards neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. With family finances tight, he took a number of odd jobs, including working as <b>a</b> <b>laborer</b> and delivering newspapers and groceries. At the suggestion of a friend, Rymkus attended Tilden Tech, now known as Tilden High School, and began to display talent as a lineman on the school's football team. He blocked a kick and scored a touchdown in a game at Chicago's Soldier Field in 1936 against rival Austin High, a play he later said was the most memorable of his high school career. Rymkus won seven letters at Tilden playing on the football, track and wrestling teams. As a senior, he defeated Rudy Mucha to win the Chicago prep-school wrestling title.|$|E

5|$|This came on {{the heels}} of controversies about whether some of Oppenheimer's students, {{including}} David Bohm, Ross Lomanitz and Bernard Peters, had been Communists at the time they had worked with him at Berkeley. Oppenheimer was called to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he admitted that he had associations with the Communist Party in the 1930s, and named some of his students as being Communists or closely associated with them. Bohm and Peters eventually left the country, while Lomanitz was forced to work as <b>a</b> <b>laborer.</b> Frank Oppenheimer was fired from his university position, and could not find work in physics for a decade. He and his wife Jackie became cattle ranchers in Colorado. Their reputations were rehabilitated in 1959, and they founded the San Francisco Exploratorium in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Finance chair Walter M. Gibson, {{supported}} by Minister of the Interior Samuel G. Wilder, pushed a new currency law through the 1880 legislature. It allowed the kingdom to purchase {{gold and silver}} bullion to be struck into new Hawaiian coins. Having the kingdom issue its own coins was one {{means by which the}} government hoped to improve Native Hawaiian morale, as their numbers and their influence had both been declining over the previous few decades. The king became more interested in coinage bearing his likeness during his world tour of 1881. During this journey, he was contacted by the owner of a New Caledonia nickel mining company hoping to use the metal in coinage, and sample five-cent pieces were sent to the king after his return to Honolulu. They found little favor, possibly because Hawaii's motto was misspelled. No action was taken until 1882, when the king appointed Gibson to lead the government. He moved forward with the coin idea; the currency was to have the king's image on the obverse side, and Hawaii's coat of arms and motto Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono (The Life of the Land is Perpetuated in Righteousness) on the reverse. The 1880 law specified that the silver coins were to be in denominations of one dollar, fifty cents, twenty-five cents, and twelve and one-half cents. Twelve and one-half cents, or one bit (one Spanish colonial real) was sometimes the day's pay for <b>a</b> <b>laborer.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} public {{corruption}} scandal of Daley's tenure as mayor involved {{the circumstances of}} the resignation of his City Council floor leader, Alderman Patrick Huels, in October 1997. Daley, Huels, and another close friend Michael Tadin grew up within two blocks on S. Emerald Avenue in Bridgeport. Huels attended De La Salle Institute, the same high school attended by Daley, his father, and Michael Bilandic. Huels worked for the city's Public Works Department as <b>a</b> <b>laborer</b> and tree trimmer, then as an administrative assistant in the Environment Department, and then as a City Council investigator. He answered phones for the 11th Ward Democratic organization, and was its secretary for several years. When Mayor Richard J. Daley died, 11th Ward Alderman Bilandic was named acting mayor, and Huels, then 26, replaced Bilandic as alderman. Huels chaired the Council's Transportation Committee and became Mayor Richard M. Daley's floor leader. In the summer of 2007, in reaction to ongoing indictments and convictions of aldermen, Daley and Huels shepherded a package of ethics reforms through city council. Huels owned a security firm, SDI Security, Inc. along with his wife and his brother, a Chicago police lieutenant. In the mid-1990s, the firm had about 390 full-time employees and was grossing $7 million a year. Huels was president and a director, and Council Finance Committee Chairman Alderman Edward M. Burke (14th) was secretary. Huels and Burke authorized $633,971 in legal consulting fees from their respective Council committees to attorney Michael A. Pedicone, a long-time officer of SDI. In March 1995 the Internal Revenue Service placed a lien on SDI for $326,951 and in June 1996 for $997,382 for failing to pay payroll taxes, including money withheld from its employees' pay checks.|$|E
