25|$|Lenticular {{galaxies are}} {{unique in that}} they have a visible disk {{component}} as well as a prominent bulge component. They have much higher bulge-to-disk ratios than typical spirals and do not have the canonical spiral arm structure of late-type galaxies, yet may exhibit a central bar. This bulge dominance {{can be seen in the}} axis ratio (i.e. the ratio between the observed minor and major axial of a disk galaxy) distribution of a lenticular galaxy sample. The distribution for lenticular galaxies rises steadily in the range 0.25 to 0.85 whereas the distribution for spirals is essentially flat in that same range. Larger axial ratios can be explained by observing face-on disk galaxies or by having a sample of spheroidal (bulge-dominated) galaxies. Imagine looking at two disk galaxies edge-on, one with a bulge and one without a bulge. The galaxy with a prominent bulge will have a larger edge-on <b>axial</b> <b>ratio</b> compared to the galaxy without a bulge based on the definition of <b>axial</b> <b>ratio.</b> Thus a sample of disk galaxies with prominent spheroidal components will have more galaxies at larger axial ratios. The fact that the lenticular galaxy distribution rises with increasing observed <b>axial</b> <b>ratio</b> implies that lenticulars are dominated by a central bulge component.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{resonating}} {{valence bond}} theory, {{the factors that}} determine the choice of one from among alternative crystal structures of a metal or intermetallic compound revolve around the energy of resonance of bonds among interatomic positions. It is clear that some modes of resonance would make larger contributions (be more mechanically stable than others), and that in particular a simple ratio of number of bonds to number of positions would be exceptional. The resulting principle is that a special stability {{is associated with the}} simplest ratios or [...] "bond numbers": , , , , , etc. The choice of structure and the value of the <b>axial</b> <b>ratio</b> (which determines the relative bond lengths) are thus a result of the effort of an atom to use its valency in the formation of stable bonds with simple fractional bond numbers.|$|E

2500|$|A {{polarization}} {{state can}} then be described {{in relation to the}} geometrical parameters of the ellipse, and its [...] "handedness", that is, whether the rotation around the ellipse is clockwise or counter clockwise. One parameterization of the elliptical figure specifies the orientation angle ψ, defined as the angle between the major axis of the ellipse and the x-axis along with the ellipticity ε=a/b, the ratio of the ellipse's major to minor axis. (also known as the <b>axial</b> <b>ratio).</b> The ellipticity parameter is an alternative parameterization of an ellipse's eccentricity , or the ellipticity angle, χ=arctanb/a=arctan1/ε as is shown in the figure. The angle χ is also significant in that the latitude (angle from the equator) of the polarization state as represented on the Poincaré sphere (see below) is equal to ±2χ. The special cases of linear and circular polarization correspond to an ellipticity ε of infinity and unity (or χ of zero and 45°) respectively.|$|E

In prolate spheroids, the <b>axial</b> <b>ratio</b> p > 1 since the axial semiaxis is longer than the equatorial semiaxes. Conversely, in oblate spheroids, the <b>axial</b> <b>ratio</b> p < 1 since the axial semiaxis is shorter than the equatorial semiaxes.

40|$|The {{background}} {{field of}} the Tadpole galaxy image taken with the Hubble Space Telescope ACS contains 87 clump-clusters that are probably low-inclination versions of the 69 chain galaxies we found in a previous paper. This conclusion follows from the similarity in colors and apparent magnitudes of the brightest clumps in the clump-clusters and chain galaxies, and from the similarity between the distribution of <b>axial</b> <b>ratios</b> for the combined sample and the distribution for normal disk galaxies. These distributions are consistent with chains and clump-clusters being disks viewed at random angles with intrinsic <b>axial</b> <b>ratios</b> of 0. 1 - 0. 2 or less.

(2015) in the Coma cluster. With high significance the data rules out an oblate, disk-like geometry, characterised by major axi a=b>c. The data is however in good agreement with prolate shapes, corresponding to a=b<c. This indicates that UDGs are not thickened, rotating, axisymmetric disks, puffed up by violent processes. Instead they are anisotropic elongated cigar- or bar-like structures, similar to the prolate dwarf spheroidal galaxy population of the Local Group. The intrinsic distribution of <b>axial</b> <b>ratios</b> of the Coma UDGs is flat {{in the range of}} 0. 4 <= a/c <= 0. 9 which will provide important constraints for theoretical models of their origin.

This in turn leads to systematic di erences in growth curves and ducial H magnitudes, prompting the present recalibration of the near-infrared Tully Fisher relationship. New optically-normalized H magnitude growth curves are de ned for galaxies of types S 0 to Im, from which new values of ducial H magnitudes, H g 00 : 5, are measured for the 665 galaxies.
