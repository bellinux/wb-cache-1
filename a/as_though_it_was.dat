5|$|According to E. P. Sanders, {{the birth}} {{narratives}} in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, {{in accordance with}} Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> invented to identify Jesus as like a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys.|$|E
25|$|Bob and Ray were an American comedy duo {{whose career}} spanned five decades. Composed of comedians Bob Elliott (1923–2016) and Ray Goulding (1922–1990), the duo's format was {{typically}} to satirize the medium {{in which they}} were performing, such as conducting radio or television interviews, with off-the-wall dialogue presented in a generally deadpan style <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a serious broadcast.|$|E
25|$|The native chronicles {{continued}} {{to confuse the}} authority of these suzerains, their governors, and the Pandya rulers, treating each <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> supreme. Vitthala Raja, a prince of Vijayanagara who invaded Travancore {{for a second time}} in 1543, took over Madurai around 1546–1547 and ruled Madurai for 12 years, until 1557–1558. James Nelson mentions that this Vitthala Raja was none other than Rama Raja of Vijayanagara.|$|E

25|$|Far less {{is known}} about the history of {{southern}} Sudan. It seems <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> home to a variety of semi-nomadic tribes. In the 16th century one of these tribes, known as the Funj, moved north and united Nubia forming the Kingdom of Sennar. The Funj sultans quickly converted to Islam and that religion steadily became more entrenched. At the same time, the Darfur Sultanate arose in the west. Between them, the Taqali established a state in the Nuba Hills.|$|E
25|$|Simons {{had grown}} tired of small town life in Kansas in any event and {{was ready for a}} new challenge. Newspaper {{publisher}} Victor Berger, now America's first socialist Congressman, had previously promised Simons a job on his English-language daily, the Milwaukee Leader, if he had ever needed a position. In June 1913, Simons decided to take Berger up on the offer, accepting the position without great enthusiasm but feeling <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for the time being the best he could do. Algie and May Simons would be coming home to Wisconsin.|$|E
25|$|Ocean City was a {{combination}} of both Tower-shaped City and Marine City. It consisted of two rings that were tangent to one another, with housing on the inner ring and production on the outer one. Administrative buildings were found at the tangent point. The population would have been rigidly controlled at an upper limit of 500,000. Kikutake envisaged that the city would expand by multiplying itself <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> undergoing cell division. This enforced the Metabolist idea that the expansion of cities could be a biological process.|$|E

25|$|There was one {{additional}} Origin contest played in 1987. The Queenslanders had climbed {{the mountain and}} at no point did they take the project seriously in any competitive sense. The State of Origin trophy was safely stowed in the Queensland Rugby League board room at Lang Park, and for the Maroons the visit to the United States was their end-of-season outing, the game an exhibition... Such was the Blues' disappointment {{at the loss of}} the State of Origin series that they would go to any length to restore some vestige of their lost pride. The New South Wales Rugby League hierarchy told their men to prepare for the contest <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a deciding test match. The match was played at the Veterans Memorial Stadium in Long Beach, California in front of 12,349 fans. The Blues won the game 30–18.|$|E
25|$|The roofed {{colonnade}} {{led from}} the enclosure wall {{to the south of}} the complex. A passageway with a limestone ceiling constructed to look <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> made from whole tree trunks led to a massive stone imitation of two open doors. Beyond this portal was a hall with twenty pairs of limestone columns composed of drum shaped segments built to look like bundles of plant stems and reaching a height of 6.6 m. The columns were not free-standing, but were attached to the wall by masonry projections. Between the columns {{on both sides of the}} hall were small chambers, which some Egyptologists propose may have been for each of the provinces of Upper and Lower Egypt. At the end of the colonnade was the transverse hypostyle room with eight columns connected in pairs by blocks of limestone. This led to the South Court.|$|E
25|$|The European Union is {{expected}} to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention). In 2005, {{the leaders of the}} Council of Europe reiterated their desire for the EU to accede without delay to ensure consistent human rights protection across Europe. There are also concerns about consistency in case law - the European Court of Justice (the EU's supreme court) is already treating the Convention <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> part of the EU's legal system to prevent conflict between its judgements and those of the European Court of Human Rights (the court interpreting the Convention). Protocol No.14 of the Convention is designed to allow the EU to accede to it and the Treaty of Lisbon contains a protocol binding the EU to joining. The EU would not be subordinate to the Council, but would be subject to its human rights law and external monitoring as its member states are currently. It is further proposed that the EU join {{as a member of the}} Council once it has attained its legal personality in the Treaty of Lisbon.|$|E

His goal that he was aiming for in this project was, [...] "to make audiences understand there should be other styles of animation beyond the existing two primary kinds of animation presented—precisely cel-drawing 2D style and CG 3D style. I wanted to show that creators are not limited, that they have many options for different (animation) styles to create stories." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1860s {{the town}} became the {{terminus}} of two railway lines. The first was opened in 1863 by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) as a short branch line from their main line. This approached the town from the south. The second and longer line was opened by the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B) in 1866 and ran northwards, {{close to the}} route of the canal, to join their main line near [...] From 1917 they were both operated by one company, but services were mostly advertised <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> still two separate lines.

500|$|At 11:00 {{local time}} on 11 November 1965, Armistice Day, during the {{traditional}} two minutes' silence {{to remember the}} fallen of the two World Wars, Smith declared Rhodesia independent and signed the proclamation document, with Dupont and the other 10 ministers of the Cabinet following. The timing was intended to emphasise the sacrifices Rhodesia had made for Britain in wartime. As Ken Flower later said, [...] "the rebellion was made to appear <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a rebellion". Smith and his ministers still pledged allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II, whose official portrait hung prominently behind them as they signed; the declaration even ended [...] "God Save The Queen". Four junior members of the Cabinet—Lance Smith, Ian Dillon, Andrew Dunlop and PK van der Byl—did not sign, but {{were included in the}} official photograph.|$|E
500|$|Kapoor often {{speaks of}} {{removing}} both {{the signature of}} the artist from his works {{as well as any}} traces of their fabrication, or what he refers to as [...] "traces of the hand". He aspires to make his works look like they have independent realities that he reveals rather than creates. For him, removing all the seams from Cloud Gate was necessary {{in order to make the}} sculpture seem <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "perfect" [...] and ready-made. These effects increase the viewer's fascination with it and makes them wonder what it is and where it came from. His attempts to hide his works' seams as an artist stand in contrast to Frank Gehry's architectural designs in the park, Jay Pritzker Pavilion and BP Pedestrian Bridge, which display their seams prominently.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the episode}} [...] "Something Nice Back Home", TV Guides Trish Wethman noted {{that she was}} {{intrigued}} by Lapidus' [...] "seemingly heroic antics" [...] in saving a group of the survivors from Keamy and his men, though overall was confused by the motivations of the freighter folk. Carabott wrote that Frank's return in the fifth season episode [...] "316" [...] was shocking, but seemed <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> meant to be. He opined that: [...] "The chances of Frank being on that plane are astronomical {{and the fact that}} he was supposed to be the pilot of Flight 815 just makes the situation all the more unusual. His appearance in this episode is absurd but after four and a half seasons of Lost it makes perfect sense." [...] James Yates of the Staten Island Advance wrote that it was [...] "great" [...] to see Frank again, as he had missed the character's presence, and hoped he would play a major part upon returning to the island.|$|E

[...] Based on this information, O'Donnell would [...] "go back and develop appropriate music cues, then have the designer script the cues into the level, and then we'd play through it to see if it worked as desired." [...] He explained that the use of music in Halo is sparse because he believes that [...] " [...] is best used in a game to quicken the emotional state of the player and it works best when used least," [...] and that [...] " [...] music is constantly playing it tends to become sonic wallpaper and loses its impact when it is needed to truly enhance some dramatic component of game play." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Holy Trinity" [...] {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews from critics upon its release. Comparisons were often drawn to Top Gear by critics. Luke Reilly of IGN awarded the episode {{a score of}} 8.0/10, stating that the show had gotten off to a [...] "confident start" [...] with the episode and that it [...] "doesn't reinvent the Top Gear formula, but rather refines it." [...] Neela Debnath of Daily Express complimented the episode's similarities with Top Gear, feeling <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "basically like Top Gear on steroids." [...] Jack Shepherd of The Independent had a similar feeling about the episode, labeling it as [...] "the best of Top Gear but with a much bigger budget" [...] in his review headline. For The Guardian, Sam Wollaston wrote that the trio [...] "leave the BBC in their dust" [...] {{and that they are}} sure to please fans of Top Gear due to the similarities between the two.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed, or simply {{referred}} to the episode as [...] "decent". Jill Mader from InsidePulse called the episode [...] "decent" [...] noting that [...] " [...] season has been shaping up." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic noted that the episode was not a [...] "fantastic episode of The Office, but it had its funny moments, and that's what I tune in for." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt wrote [...] "Doomsday" [...] was not [...] "a terrible episode by any means [...] the various pieces never fell into place, and the resolution didn't feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> earned by the episode that came before it. It just {{felt like it was}} trying to do too much too quickly, never quite narrowing in on character in the midst of manufacturing chaos." [...] McNutt ultimately gave the episode a B-. Despite some of the more mixed reviews, a large majority of critics found the cold-opening humorous, with many noting that it was the best of the season so far.|$|E
