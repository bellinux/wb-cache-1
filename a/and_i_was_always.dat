500|$|On May 10, 1983, Howard Emerson, the {{adviser to}} the journalism class, {{submitted}} page proofs of the May 13 issue of the newspaper to principal Robert Eugene Reynolds for approval, a practice that was customary at the time. Reynolds objected {{to two of the}} stories scheduled to run. One was about teen pregnancy, containing interviews with three students who had been pregnant. The story used false names to keep the girls' identities a secret, but Reynolds was concerned that the students would still be identifiable from the text. He was also concerned that the references to sexual activity and birth control were inappropriate for younger students at the school. The second story was about divorce and featured an interview with a student whose parents were divorced, in which she complained that her father [...] "wasn't spending enough time with my mom, my sister, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> ... <b>was</b> <b>always</b> out of town on business or out late playing cards with the guys ... always argued about everything". Reynolds, unaware that the girl's name would also be changed, argued that her family should have been given an opportunity to respond within the story, or to object to its publication.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{developed}} serious drug habits while touring {{with the}} band during the previous four years. He {{said that when he}} [...] "found out that Flea was stoned out of his mind at every show, that inspired me to be a pothead". Not only was Frusciante smoking large amounts of marijuana, but he began to use heroin and {{was on the verge of}} full-scale addiction. Upon returning to California in the summer of 1992, Frusciante entered a deep depression, feeling that his life was over and that he could no longer write music or play guitar. For a long time, he focused on painting, producing 4-track recordings he had made while working on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and writing short stories and screenplays. To cope with his worsening depression, Frusciante increased his heroin use and spiraled into a life-threatening dependency. His use of heroin to medicate his depression was a clear decision: [...] "I was very sad, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> happy when I was on drugs; therefore, I should be on drugs all the time. I was never guilty—I was always really proud to be an addict." [...] Frusciante openly admitted to being a [...] "junkie", believing that drugs were the only way of [...] "making sure you stay in touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite Lassie {{doing well}} with the TV audiences, Tommy Rettig sought release from his {{contract}} in the popular series' fourth season. [...] Clayton quit the production as well at that time. [...] "My home life was being absolutely wrecked," [...] she explained. [...] "I had four children and a husband, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> working".|$|E

2500|$|McEwan told The Press, [...] "Every ball I faced I endeavoured {{to score}} runs. There {{is so much}} dead cricket, so many balls just patted back. Garfield Sobers said the best line of defence is attack <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> looking to {{dominate}} a game. I {{wanted to be on}} top of the game".|$|E
2500|$|Oglala Sioux Black Elk {{recounted the}} exodus this way: [...] "We fled all night, {{following}} the Greasy Grass. My two younger brothers and I rode in a pony-drag, {{and my mother}} put some young pups in with us. They were always trying to crawl out <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> putting them back in, so I didn't sleep much." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Clayton of ESPN {{stated that}} Russell's {{workouts}} at the 2007 NFL Combine that Russell's arm strength and size impressed several teams, and predicted {{that it would}} [...] "be hard to pass up on Russell at #1." [...] At the combine, Russell stated about his size, [...] "I've been playing quarterback ever since. I was always bigger and taller than the other kids, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> able to throw it a pretty good length of the field." [...] Cleveland Browns General Manager Phil Savage said of Russell's abilities, [...] "His talent is substantial. He's a rare combination of size and arm strength." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "He (Marriott) was {{certainly}} the most talented person I ever worked with. He was like a brother to me and I was devastated when he died. He always lived on the edge <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> waiting for a 'phone call {{to say that he}} had died but I never dreamed it would be under those circumstances. He's never got the credit he deserves. He should be in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame because he was the greatest white soul singer that England ever produced. I'm certain that if you caught the likes of Rod Stewart and Paul Rodgers in a private moment and asked them who was the main man, they would say, Steve Marriott." [...] – Jerry Shirley ...|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{walked a}} step ahead of us, but when he noticed me hurrying to catch up, he {{shortened}} his stride to accommodate mine. I kept reaching up for his hand, but he hadn't looked down and seemed unaware. Fannie called his attention to what I was doing, so he stopped short, bent low over me, his eyes wide and rows of brilliant teeth showing in a wide smile. When he took my hand in his, it felt large and cool. For a few moments, we continued walking in silence. [...] "Can I call you Uncle Billy?" [...] I asked. [...] "Why sure you can", he replied... "But then I get to call you darlin.'" [...] It was a deal. From then on, whenever we walked together it was hand in hand, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> his [...] "darlin.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said [...] "Liam Cosgrave {{was someone}} who {{devoted his life to}} public service; a {{grateful}} country thanks and honours him for that and for always putting the nation first. Throughout his life he worked to protect and defend the democratic institutions of our State, and showed great courage and determination in doing so. He always believed in peaceful co-operation as the only way of achieving a genuine union between the people on this island, and in the 1970s he celebrated that this country had embarked, in his own words, ‘on a new career of progress and development in the context of Europe’. I had the honour on a few occasions to meet and be in the presence of Liam Cosgrave, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> struck by his commanding presence and great humility, which in him were complementary characteristics. [...] " [...] His funeral was held on 7 October 2017.|$|E

2500|$|Callas herself {{appears to}} have been in {{agreement}} not only with Ardoin's assertions that she started as a natural mezzo-soprano, but also saw the similarities between herself and Pasta and Malibran. In 1957, she described her early voice as: [...] "The timbre was dark, almost black—when I think of it, I think of thick molasses", and in 1968 she added, [...] "They say I was not a true soprano, I was rather toward a mezzo". Regarding her ability to sing the heaviest as well as the lightest roles, she told James Fleetwood, It's study; it's Nature. I'm doing nothing special, you know. Even Lucia, Anna Bolena, Puritani, all these operas were created for one type of soprano, the type that sang Norma, Fidelio, which was Malibran of course. And a funny coincidence last year, I was singing Anna Bolena and Sonnambula, same months and the same distance of time as Giuditta Pasta had sung in the nineteenth century... So I'm really not doing anything extraordinary. You wouldn't ask a pianist [...] {{to be able to play}} everything; he [...] to. This is Nature and also because I had a wonderful teacher, the old kind of teaching methods... I was a very heavy voice, that is my nature, a dark voice shall we call it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> kept on the light side. She always trained me to keep my voice limber.|$|E
60|$|I sat still, smoking my {{pipe and}} pretending to hear nothing. It is awkward {{to listen to}} oneself being praised, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a shy man.|$|E

6000|$|... "Exactly so; talk of me, you know, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>always</b> at hand: besides, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not half}} so black as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> painted, {{as you will}} see when you know me a little better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who? I? Did {{you ever}} know me {{have any money}} in hand since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> married? <b>I</b> have {{the name of an}} allowance, but it <b>is</b> <b>always</b> spent before it comes to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>always</b> in debt." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You've both {{grown so}} pretty, I can't decide which I like best.

6000|$|... "Come!" [...] John went on, [...] "I {{have only}} just left off being a boy, myself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> {{climbing}} into {{all sorts of}} places, when I got a chance; and I have no doubt it's the same, with you.

6000|$|... "I may be wrong," [...] said Mr. Hill, [...] "but I {{have played}} a certain amount, don't you know, in pretty good companies, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> under the {{impression}} that one should address one's remarks to the person one was speaking to, not deliver a recitation to the gallery.

5000|$|Camus did not {{consider}} himself to be an existentialist despite usually being classified as a follower of it, even in his lifetime. In a 1945 interview, Camus rejected any ideological associations: [...] "No, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not an existentialist.

6000|$|... "It {{is rather}} a coincidence," [...] he {{admitted}} [...] "She had {{a sort of}} craze to visit some of the places in Paris where it is necessary for a woman to go incognito, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> her escort.

6000|$|... "See him! I've fielded {{out for him}} {{and melted}} on a hot August day while he made a hundred and fifty. There's a pound or two of your Daddy somewhere on that field yet.

6000|$|... "Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, {{and ever}} since Shrewsbury," [...] pursued Carton, [...] "you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris, picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we didn't get much good of, you were always somewhere, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> nowhere." ...|$|E

5000|$|In response, she stated, “I feel marginalized <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>always</b> {{under fire}} in the Middle East media because of my liberal views <b>and</b> because <b>I</b> strive to break the boundaries.
