30|$|Clearly, International Non-Governmental Organisations (INGOs) must {{negotiate}} access {{within a}} political arena filled with multiple actors, including beneficiaries, host and donor governments, local communities, and humanitarian organisations themselves. Within this arena, aid gets shaped through {{the interactions between}} these multiple actors (Hilhorst and Jansen 2010 : 1121). For example, aid workers must obtain permission to implement activities from the political authorities, including fulfilling administrative procedures such as obtaining visas and other permits and organising the importation of supplies and establishing proper communications (Warner 1999). A variety of political actors must be influenced concerning policy issues affecting humanitarian organisations, such as NGO laws, although political engagement {{should not be confused}} with advocacy 2 activities or a theory of change 3 framework. Both are simply tools within the wider domain of political engagement, which is inclusive of an organisation’s action and presence, such as the implementation of aid programmes, negotiations to reach populations requiring aid, the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding,</b> and organisational reputation. These elements interact within a political context—within the community of states, intergovernmental organisations, local administrations, and informal power structures. Within this environment states (Yale Law School 2001) and the UN (United Nations General Assembly 2015), as well as regional military alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) (CBC News 2010), steer the delivery of aid to their own political advantage. The instrumentalism of aid, however, is not our primary concern, rather the political motivations and actions of humanitarian organisations themselves and the tools which they use to achieve these objectives.|$|R

40|$|The General Education Board's (GEB) {{substantial}} {{contributions to}} African American {{education in the}} South are well documented, but how the Board prioritized what types of black educational institutions to fund has received less attention. How did the Board decide {{between public and private}} schools, industrial training and academic curricula, common schools and colleges? And how did the Board's thinking on these issues evolve over time due to changes in personnel and leadership? Furthermore, to what extent did the preferences of white Southerners influence the Board's decision making in these matters? My research at the Rockefeller Archive Center focused on three institutions that represented the full range of possibilities for black education in the early twentieth century. North Carolina College for Negroes at Durham, which was chartered in 1925 as the region's first state-sponsored four-year liberal arts college for African Americans, began as the privately funded but denominationally unaffiliated National Religious Training School in 1909. The Mississippi Negro Training School, which did not became part of the Mississippi state system until 1940, began in 1882 as Jackson College, an institution supported by the American Home Baptist Missionary Society. Virginia State College for Negroes in Petersburg, chartered in 1930, {{had been part of the}} public system since its establishment as Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute in 1882. In 1902, its name was changed to Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute. Each of these institutions received financial support from the GEB at some point in their developing years, though none was ever a favorite institution of the Board. Thus, the correspondence records and reports for these schools in the GEB files reveal more rejections than <b>acceptances</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> proposals. But within these interoffice discussions of why the Board chose not to fund these schools is a treasure trove of information. Because of chronic underfunding, several historically black colleges and universities possess little in the way of archival records concerning their institutional pasts. The state bureaucratic records pertaining to the establishment and maintenance <b>of</b> publicly <b>funded</b> historically black institutions, particularly in Mississippi and Virginia, are also limited.
