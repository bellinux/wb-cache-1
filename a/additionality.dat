25|$|It is also {{important}} for any carbon credit (offset) to prove a concept called <b>additionality.</b> The concept of <b>additionality</b> addresses {{the question of whether}} the project would have happened in the absence of an intervention in the form of the price signal of carbon credits. Only projects with emissions below their baseline level, defined as emissions under a scenario without this price signal (holding all other factors constant), represent a net environmental benefit. Carbon projects that yield strong financial returns even in the absence of revenue from carbon credits; or that are compelled by regulations; or that represent common practice in an industry; are usually not considered additional. A full determination of <b>additionality</b> requires a careful investigation of proposed carbon offset projects.|$|E

The condition of funds having to be new means that pledges should come on top of those made in previous years. As far as <b>additionality</b> is concerned, there is no strict definition of this term, which has already led to serious problems in evaluating the <b>additionality</b> of emission reductions through CDM-projects, leading to counter-productivity, and even fraud. While climate finance usually only counts pledges from developed countries, the US$10.3 billion pledged to the GCF also includes some (relatively small) contributions from developing countries.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to fill gaps faced by policymakers and practitioners {{in the evaluation}} of cross-border infrastructure projects. It first defines what constitutes cross-border infrastructure projects, and then outlines an analytical framework and criteria to evaluate them. The criteria identify <b>additionalities</b> and externalities specific to cross-border infrastructure projects that need to be stressed in covering broader and indirect impacts that are not usually captured in the analysis of national projects. Then the paper examines to what extent the defined criteria are applicable in evaluating recent cross-border infrastructure projects. It also reports on emerging impacts patterns evidenced in relevant studies. The paper draws lessons and implications for design and implementation of cross- border infrastructure projects. cross-border infrastructure, <b>additionalities,</b> externalities...|$|R

2500|$|The Kyoto {{mechanism}} {{is the only}} internationally agreed mechanism for regulating carbon credit activities, [...] and, crucially, includes checks for <b>additionality</b> and overall effectiveness. Its supporting organisation, the UNFCCC, is the only organisation with a global mandate on the overall effectiveness of emission control systems, although enforcement of decisions relies on national co-operation. The Kyoto trading period only applies for five years between 2008 and 2012. The {{first phase of the}} EU ETS system started before then, and is expected to continue in a third phase afterwards, and may co-ordinate with whatever is internationally agreed at but there is general uncertainty as to what will be agreed in Post–Kyoto Protocol negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions. As business investment often operates over decades, this adds risk and uncertainty to their plans. As several countries responsible for a large proportion of global emissions (notably USA, India, China) have avoided mandatory caps, this also means that businesses in capped countries may perceive themselves to be working at a competitive disadvantage against those in uncapped countries as they are now paying for their carbon costs directly.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} {{of cars and}} car components has become a more and more complex affair, requiring more and more inputs {{from a wide range}} of actors and technology domains. Hence, automotive firms must look increasingly beyond the intramural setting and reach out to external partners and sources to master innovation processes. The sensitisation of firms towards so-called open innovation practises can be facilitated by means of innovation support schemes run by public actors. The present paper evaluates the <b>additionalities</b> of several of such schemes from the UK and the Netherlands. It concludes that the schemes succeed in getting SMEs warm for sourcing external knowledge, skills and facilities for innovation purposes and in getting them into the open innovation mode. Notably the higher equity schemes demonstrate relevant and sustainable effects in this regard. Nonetheless, opening up automotive SMEs for cooperative and multiparty innovation practises appears is for many cases a question of long breath, and will require sustained action to really institutionalise multi-party innovation practises into their behavioural patterns. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effects of Austria's recent Special Funds {{initiative}} on the R&D expenditures of its private corporate sector. It {{is the first one}} to approach the due evaluation from a macro perspective. First, simple descriptive statistics show that the noticeable delays in actual disbursements and the replacement of regular RTI funds by these special funds reduce the latter's scope. Apparently, money can't work unless it is spent and "additional" funds at the expense of regular funds will trigger no <b>additionalities.</b> We then set up an econometric model to derive some inference on the relative importance of different public support channels on the business sector's R&D spending. Though the estimates suggest that direct government subsidies to R&D-performing firms unfold great leverage effects, the dynamics of output growth as well as an R&D-prone high-tech industry structure seem to be more important drivers of the business sector's R&D intensity. Likewise, feeding special funds into the higher education sector will raise the R&D-intensity of the business enterprise sector only if and to the degree that such funds contribute to Austria's overall economic prosperity or foster structural change towards more R&D-intensive manufacturing.

40|$|Many {{countries}} {{are seeking to}} strengthen global economic competitiveness by building a 'knowledge economy' capability. A popular approach is supporting university-industry knowledge exchange linkages. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to show how a model developed by the Cambridge-MIT Institute (CMI) for the UK offers a more effective approach to knowledge sharing, and to present the results from one of the first projects launched by CMI. CMI looked at the background literature and relevant government policy, benchmarked peer grant-making organisations, studied the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Cambridge University institutions, and organized expert consultation through a strategic planning process including 27 stakeholder groups. Based on these inputs, CMI formulated its Knowledge Integration Community (KIC) model hypothesis. This paper describes the functional components, support mechanisms, organisational structure, review processes and mechanisms for knowledge exchange. Beginning in 2003, CMI built seven experimental KICs: five completely new, and two built up from existing, more traditional research projects. One of these is the Silent Aircraft KIC, which is presented as a case study. The paper makes an early analysis of the outcomes and <b>additionalities</b> of the KIC, and presents the lessons and future implications for the KIC. The paper concludes by describing the broader relevance of this approach for other institutions and countries, and suggests it is something other university-, government- and industry-based research institutions could embark upon. ...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{countries}} {{have recently been}} emulating innovation policies implemented by developed countries with the firm conviction that it will improve their economic development prospects. Nevertheless, the specificities and conditions of the former group differ from the latter. Technological as well as absorptive and innovation capacities are key factors determining these differences. According to the literature on evaluating innovation policy, these key issues have been overlooked by current evaluation practices in developing countries. Another literature, dealing with global value chains, claims that upgrading firms functionally and inter-sectorally may allow developing countries to escape {{the negative effects of}} globalisation highlighted by dependency theory and the law of uneven development. However, there is a gap between these two literatures. To date, no empirical evaluation framework for the evaluation of innovation policies in developing countries explicitly considers either the importance of technological and absorptive capacity building, or the likelihood of firms to upgrade functionally and inter-sectorally in global value chains. This thesis fills that gap by developing and validating an evaluation framework of innovation policies in developing countries which explicitly considers these important factors. Evaluation of business innovation policies implemented in Mexico from 2006 to 2009 served as a laboratory to test this methodological framework. A unique dataset, gathered via telephone survey, was populated with a collected sample of 477 observations; these included information on firm performance and innovation activities of 164 successful applicants for government support for business innovation, as well as a control group of 313 firms. Through a self-assessment exercise, recipients acknowledged the benefits of government support for business innovation. These benefits include crowding-in effects and positive behavioural <b>additionalities,</b> principally enlarging the research scope of firms and augmenting their cognitive capacities. When compared with the control group, the results suggest that recipients outperformed non-recipients in six types of innovation. In addition, successful applicants performed well when compared to the control group in terms of turnover and productivity, though employment {{has been found to be}} statistically not significant. (This result suggests that recipients may focus on capital-intensive process innovations.) An innovation production model has been estimated and the application of a 2 -step Heckman (1979) bias model indicated that government support for business innovation positively affects firm performance in terms of labour productivity growth, even when controlling for selection effects. Methodologically, this study makes a novel and timely contribution to the existing research by estimating the likelihood of firms in developing countries to achieve functional and/or inter-sectoral upgrading overlooked to date by the evaluation community. In addition, the algorithm developed to identify ‘high-potential innovative firms’ has important policy implications. The evaluation framework developed here makes a solid and novel contribution to two strands of the literature: evaluation of business innovation in developing countries and upgrading of firms in global value chains. It also provides insights to policymakers with regards to the identification of ‘high potential innovative firms’ through a predictive algorithm. This evaluation framework was tested in the Mexican context, and has the potential to be replicated for developing countries with similar characteristics; there are transferable lessons to be learnt regardless of the country context...|$|R

Some low-carbon electricity supply projects were also thought to have displaced coal-powered generation. Carbon Trust (2009) reviewed some approved projects. In their view, some of these projects had debatable points in their <b>additionality</b> assessments. They compared establishing <b>additionality</b> to the balance of evidence in a legal system.

For ex ante applications, <b>additionality</b> is evaluated for proposed activities. A proposed activity is additional if the recognized interventions are deemed to be causing the activity to take place. The occurrence of <b>additionality</b> is determined by assessing whether a proposed activity is distinct from its baseline. A baseline is a prediction of the quantified amount of an input to or output from an activity resulting from the expected future behavior of the actors proposing, and affected by, the proposed activity in the absence of one or more policy interventions, holding all other factors constant (ceteris paribus).|$|E

5000|$|An {{argument}} against <b>additionality</b> {{is based on}} the fact that developing countries are not subject to emission caps in the Kyoto Protocol (Müller, 2009, pp. iv, 9-10). On these basis, [...] "business-as-usual" [...] (BAU) emissions (i.e., emissions that would occur without any efforts to reduce them) in developing countries should be allowed. By setting a BAU baseline, this can be interpreted as being a target for developing countries. Thus, it is, in effect, a restriction on their right to emit without a cap. This can be used as an {{argument against}} having <b>additionality,</b> in the sense that non-additional (i.e., emission reductions that would have taken place under BAU) emission reductions should be credited.|$|E
