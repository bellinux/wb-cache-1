40|$|Suspensions of Halobacterium cutirubrum, {{grown and}} {{suspended}} in 4. 0 M sodium chloride, showed on transfer to increasingly lower concentrations of sodium chloride {{an increase in}} turbidity followed by an abrupt decrease. When the suspensions were placed in potassium, rubidium, cesium, lithium, or <b>ammonium</b> <b>chlorides,</b> there was no increase in turbidity but usually a gradual decrease as the concentration of the salt is decreased. In potassium, rubidium, and cesium chlorides these changes were correlated with a change in morphology from rods, through transition forms, to spheres, similar to changes in NaCl, except that transition forms were found even at concentrations of 4. 0 M. In lithium and <b>ammonium</b> <b>chlorides</b> there was an immediate change at 5. 0 and 4. 5 M respectively and two to five small spheres were formed from each rod. In mixtures of sodium and potassium chlorides the morphology of the cells depended on the ionic strength and concentration of sodium. Spheres were also produced by heating the cells to 602 ̆ 01370 0 C, the time required for the conversion increasing with increasing salt concentration. In urea solutions the cells lysed, although at certain concentrations of urea and NaCl a change to small spheres was observed. Ionic detergents caused the cells to disintegrate gradually.

5|$|Along with {{carnotite}} and roscoelite, vanadinite {{is one of}} {{the main}} industrial ores of the element vanadium, which can be extracted by roasting and smelting. Vanadinite is also occasionally used as a source of lead. A common process for extracting the vanadium begins with the heating of vanadinite with salt (NaCl) or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) at about 850°C to produce sodium vanadate (NaVO3). This is dissolved in water and then treated with <b>ammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> to give an orange-coloured precipitate of ammonium metavanadate. This is then melted to form a crude form of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5). Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium.|$|E
5|$|One {{suitable}} {{method for}} purification for the raw platinum, which contains platinum, gold, {{and the other}} platinum-group metals, is to process it with aqua regia, in which palladium, gold and platinum are dissolved, whereas osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium stay unreacted. The gold is precipitated {{by the addition of}} iron(II) chloride and after filtering off the gold, the platinum is precipitated as ammonium chloroplatinate by the addition of <b>ammonium</b> <b>chloride.</b> Ammonium chloroplatinate can be converted to platinum by heating. Unprecipitated hexachloroplatinate(IV) may be reduced with elemental zinc, and a similar method is suitable for small scale recovery of platinum from laboratory residues.

40|$|The {{dermal route}} of {{exposure}} is important in worker exposure to biocidal products. Many biocidal active substances which are used {{on a daily basis}} may decrease the barrier function of the skin to a larger extent than current risk assessment practice addresses, due to possible skin effects of repeated exposure. The influence of repeated and single exposure to representative biocidal active substances on the skin barrier was investigated in vitro. The biocidal active substances selected were alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride (ADBAC), boric acid, deltamethrin, dimethyldidecylammonium chloride (DDAC), formaldehyde, permethrin, piperonyl butoxide, sodium bromide, and tebuconazole. Of these nine compounds, only the quaternary <b>ammonium</b> <b>chlorides</b> ADBAC and DDAC had a clear and consistent influence on skin permeability of the marker compounds tritiated water and [14 C]propoxur. For these compounds, repeated exposure increased skin permeability more than single exposure. At high concentrations the difference between single and repeated exposure was quantitatively significant: repeated exposure to 300 mg/L ADBAC increased skin permeability two to threefold in comparison to single exposure. Therefore, single and repeated exposure to specific biocidal products may significantly increase skin permeability, especially when used undiluted. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRoof {{maintenance}} practices often involve {{the application of}} biocide products to fight against moss, lichens and algae. The main component of these products is benzalkonium chloride, a mixture of alkyl benzyl dimethyl <b>ammonium</b> <b>chlorides</b> with mainly C 12 and C 14 alkyl chain lengths, which is toxic for the aquatic environment. This paper describes, {{on the basis of}} an in-situ pilot scale study, the evolution of roof runoff contamination over a one year period following the biocide treatment of roof frames. Results show a major contamination of roof runoff immediately after treatment (from 5 to 30 mg/L), followed by an exponential decrease. 175 - 375 mm of cumulated rainfall is needed before the runoff concentrations become less than EC 50 values for fish (280 mu g/l). The residual concentration in the runoff water remains above 4 mu g/L even after 640 mm of rainfall. The level of benzalkonium ions leaching depends on the roofing material, with lower concentrations and total mass leached from ceramic tiles than from concrete tiles, and {{on the state of the}} tile (new or worn out). Mass balance calculations indicate that a large part of the mass of benzalkonium compounds applied to the tiles is lost, probably due to biodegradation processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
