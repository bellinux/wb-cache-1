40|$|Previous {{studies of}} event returns {{surrounding}} bank mergers show that banks gain value in megamergers and additional value when they absorb in-market competitors. A portion of these gains has been {{traced to the}} increased bargaining power of banks vis-a-vis regulators and other competitors. We demonstrate that increased bargaining power of megabanks adversely affects loan customers of the <b>acquired</b> <b>institution.</b> Wealth losses are greater when loan customers are credit-constrained, the loan customer is smaller, or the acquisition is an in-market deal. These findings reinforce complaints that the ongoing consolidation in banking has unfavorably affected the availability of credit for smaller firms and especially capital-constrained firms. ...|$|R

40|$|Given {{the pivotal}} role of banks in modern economies, the {{worldwide}} phenomenon {{of a high}} level of bank M&A activity and the consensus view in empirical studies that bank mergers destroy value for acquiring bank shareholders, it is highly surprising that the influence of corporate governance on the outcomes of bank acquisitions has received very little academic scrutiny. The recent wave of consolidation in the financial services industry, with its generally unfavourable wealth implications for the shareholders of <b>acquiring</b> <b>institutions,</b> points to the impact of poor bank governance structures. Moreover, the banking sector warrants a separate agency analysis because it is unusual, if not unique, in terms of the opaque nature of many of its main activities {{and in terms of the}} pervasive role of regulation in the industry. Both of these attributes may weaken well-established monitoring mechanisms as safeguards of shareholder interests.

40|$|Foreign bank {{entrants}} into {{emerging markets}} are usually thought {{to improve the}} condition and performance of <b>acquired</b> <b>institutions,</b> and more generally to enhance local financial stability. We use bank-specific data {{for a range of}} Latin American countries since the mid- 1990 s to address elements of this claim. Across the seven largest countries, we find that the financial strength ratings of local banks acquired by foreign entities generally show a slight improvement relative to their domestic counterparts. Our more in-depth case studies of Chile, Colombia, and Argentina do not indicate striking differences in health between larger foreign and domestic retail-oriented banks (although state banks are noticeably weaker). However, foreign banks often have higher average loan growth, higher average provisioning expense, and greater loss-absorption capacity. These results suggest that foreign ownership may provide important positive influences on the stability and development of emerging market banking systems.

40|$|Abstract The {{spate of}} {{hospital}} consolidations {{that occurred in}} the late 1990 s and early 2000 s {{had a profound impact on}} the US hospital industry. However, only two published studies using data from five states examined the effects of these consolidations on inpatient quality of care. This paper examines the impacts of hospital consolidations that occurred in 1999 and 2000 in 16 states on 25 measures of quality using pre–post, difference‐in‐differences models. We categorize hospitals participating in consolidations as <b>acquiring</b> <b>institutions,</b> target institutions, or participants in a “merger of equals”. We find that the quality effects of consolidations differ by the hospital’s role and the quality measure used. Acquiring hospitals experienced significantly improved quality with respect to iatrogenic pneumothorax and postoperative hemorrhage or hematoma, but the quality impacts for target hospitals and “mergers of equals” were mixed. Hospital consolidations appear to have complex, inconsistent effects on quality, as measured using all‐payer administrative data, suggesting the need for antitrust agencies to conduct prospective and retrospective reviews of individual mergers.

40|$|During {{the recent}} {{financial}} crisis, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) auctioned {{most of the}} failed banks. A distinguishing character of these failed bank auctions is that the failed banks are sold at discount from the most recent quarter valuation of their reported asset value. A second distinguishing feature of these auctions is that acquirers of these failed banks have frequently reported bargain purchase gain (BPG) compared to regular mergers during the same period. Based on a unique sample of the FDIC-assisted whole-bank transactions in the recent financial crisis, we measure discount using accounting information, investigate what factors lead to larger discount and larger reporting of BPGs, and further {{examine the effects of}} discount on the post-merger performance of the <b>acquiring</b> <b>institutions.</b> Consistent with prior literature, we identify bidding competitiveness and loss sharing agreement as significant determinants. However, DIF reserve ratio, the proxy for the financial condition of the FDIC and relative size between the failed bank and the acquirer, are not found to have significant and consistent relation with discount. As expected, we document that discount can inflate the post-merger profitability of acquirers. Overall, our study provides insights about the intrinsic connection between the discount determinants and the features of the FDIC-assisted failed bank resolution...|$|R
