5|$|In the 1940s, the {{south-east}} {{corner of}} the castle tower collapsed; the corner {{fell to the ground}} intact and because of its archaeological value it was decided to leave the fallen stonework in place on the ground, rather than risk further damaging it by removing it. In 1946 the castle was given to the Ministry of Works, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the control of the Welsh heritage agency Cadw and operated as a tourist attraction. The castle sits within the grounds of the small Loughor Castle Park.|$|E
5|$|On July 27, 2012, {{following}} a thorough {{evaluation of the}} roller coaster, Kings Island announced that Son of Beast will {{be removed from the}} park to make room for future expansion. Demolition began in mid-September 2012. On November 20, one of the last remaining parts of the structure, the lift hill, was demolished. A new roller coaster called Banshee was completed in April 2014 <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the same location previously occupied by Son of Beast.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} {{was later}} {{used as a}} hayloft. In 1978 it passed into the guardianship of the state, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the care of English Heritage {{and open to the}} public. Still well preserved, it is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building.|$|E

5|$|Walker's {{successor}} Bruce Rioch lasted {{two seasons}} and departed {{in the summer}} of 2000. While Rioch failed to gain promotion, his time at Norwich did leave a lasting impact in his man-management of Iwan Roberts, who had been struggling to perform. Roberts himself has ascribed his difficulties to being overweight; the turnaround was, according to Roberts, due to some clever psychology by Rioch. Roberts scored 23 goals in the 1998–99 season, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the club's Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Altar 19 {{was buried}} in the fill of the final version of Temple 33, {{immediately}} in front of the second version of the summit shrine. It was badly damaged and was broken into several pieces, and the majority of a sculpture depicting a seated person was chipped away. The three fragments were buried together in a way that paired the altar with the buried Stela 31; this may have maintained a relationship between the monuments that existed when they were originally on public display. The altar was crafted from limestone <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the site museum at Tikal. It has been dated to approximately AD 445.|$|E

5|$|Among other languages, Nepali, Hindi and Bengali are {{prominent}} vernacular languages {{used in this}} region. Newspapers in all these four languages {{are available in the}} Darjeeling Hills region. Of the largely circulated Nepali newspapers Himalay Darpan, Swarnabhumi and some Sikkim-based Nepali newspapers like Hamro Prajashakti and Samay Dainik are read most. The Tibet Mirror was the first Tibetan-language newspaper published in Kalimpong in 1925. while Himalayan Times was the first English to have come out from Kalimpong in the year 1947, it was closed down in the year 1962 after the Chinese aggression but was started once again <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> regular print. It is known for its bold and aggressive stand on all local issues.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1876, Thunderer {{suffered}} a disastrous boiler explosion which killed 45 people. One of her boilers burst as she proceeded from Portsmouth Harbour to Stokes Bay {{to carry out}} a full-power trial. The explosion killed 15 people instantly, including her commanding officer; around 70 others were injured, of whom 30 later died. This was the Royal Navy's most deadly boiler explosion through the whole century. A model representing the failed boiler was made <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the Science Museum. The explosion was caused because a pressure gauge was broken and the safety valve had corroded in place. When the steam stop valve to the engines was closed, pressure in the boiler rose and could not be released. The four box boilers were the last in service in the Navy and operated at what would even then would have been considered a relatively low pressure, for more modern boilers, of 30 psi. The boiler was repaired and the ship was completed on 26 May 1877 at a cost of £368,428.|$|E
5|$|Piel Castle, {{also known}} as Fouldry Castle or the Pile of Fouldray, is a castle {{situated}} on the south-eastern point of Piel Island, {{off the coast of}} the Furness Peninsula in north-west England. Built in the early-14th century by John Cockerham, the Abbot of neighbouring Furness Abbey, it was intended to oversea the trade through the local harbour and to protect against Scottish raids. The castle was built using stones from the local beach, and featured a large keep with surrounding inner and outer baileys. It was used as a base by the Yorkist pretender Lambert Simnel in 1487, but by 1534 it had fallen into ruin and passed {{into the hands of the}} Crown. Sea erosion began to cause significant damage to the castle in the early 19th century. In the 1870s the castle's owner, the Duke of Buccleuch, carried out extensive restoration work and erected outworks to protect it against further damage from the sea. In 1920 the castle was given to the town of Barrow-in-Furness <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the care of English Heritage.|$|E

5|$|Sometime {{during the}} 20th or 21st Dynasty Amenhotep's {{original}} tomb was either robbed or deemed insecure and emptied {{and his body}} was moved for safety, probably more than once. It {{was found in the}} Deir el-Bahri Cache, hidden with the mummies of numerous New Kingdom kings and nobles in or after the late 22nd dynasty above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. His mummy had apparently not been looted by the 21st dynasty, and the priests who moved the mummy took care to keep the Cartonnage intact. Because of that exquisite face mask, Amenhotep's is the only royal mummy which has not been unwrapped and examined by modern Egyptologists.|$|E
5|$|The Code of Hammurabi was {{inscribed on}} a stele {{and placed in}} a public place so that all could see it, {{although}} it is thought that few were literate. The stele was later plundered by the Elamites and removed to their capital, Susa; it was rediscovered there in 1901 in Iran <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the Louvre Museum in Paris. The code of Hammurabi contained 282 laws, written by scribes on 12 tablets. Unlike earlier laws, it was written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylon, and could therefore be read by any literate person in the city.|$|E
5|$|The Triumph of Cleopatra, {{also known}} as Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia and The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia, is an oil {{painting}} by English artist William Etty. It was first exhibited in 1821, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight across the River Mersey from Liverpool. During the 1810s Etty had become widely respected among staff and students at the Royal Academy of Arts, in particular for his use of colour and ability to paint realistic flesh tones. Despite having exhibited at every Summer Exhibition since 1811 he attracted little commercial or critical interest. In 1820 he exhibited The Coral Finder, which showed nude figures on a gilded boat. This painting {{attracted the attention of}} Sir Francis Freeling, who commissioned a similar painting on a more ambitious scale.|$|E

50|$|Howitt {{collected}} botanical specimens {{during his}} expeditions in north-eastern South Australia, south-western Queensland and western New South Wales; his collections {{were sent to}} Baron von Mueller <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> Melbourne.|$|R
5|$|The {{electric}} motor {{was equipped with}} several hundred feet of cable carried on a reel. The cable attached to a specially designed electrical outlet box that was nearest to the fire. The box would be located next to the water plugs throughout the city districts in the manner previously mentioned. When the engine was tested, it gave very good results, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> use at the factory of the Crocker-Wheeler Electric Company, in Ampere, New Jersey. The company claimed that an electric fire engine of the same capacity as a steam fire engine would be more efficient.|$|E
5|$|The {{garden was}} {{saved by the}} Member of {{parliament}} Albert Grant, who purchased the park in 1874 for £11,060 and donated it to the Metropolitan Board of Works. The title deed for the square passed to the succeeding public bodies <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the ownership of the City of Westminster. After the purchase, the architect James Knowles redesigned the park. A statue of William Shakespeare surrounded by dolphins was constructed in the centre. The four corner gates of the park had one bust each of famous former residents in the square: the scientist Sir Isaac Newton designed by W. Calder Marshall; Sir Joshua Reynolds, the first President of the Royal Academy by H. Weekes; John Hunter, a pioneer of surgery, by T. Wooler; and William Hogarth, the painter, by J. Durham. Ownership transferred to Westminster City Council in 1933. The most recent addition was a bronze statue of film star and director Charlie Chaplin, designed by sculptor John Doubleday in 1981. On the pavement were inscribed the distances in miles to several Commonwealth countries, including Canada, Kenya and Jamaica. After the Great Outdoors refurbishment of the square, only the statue of Shakespeare still remains.|$|E
5|$|The priory {{was founded}} in the early 13th century, and {{dedicated}} to Thomas Becket. The founder, William de Courtney, was a grandson of Reginald Fitzurse, one of Becket's murderers. In 1849 a reliquary was found in St Paul's Church, Kewstoke that was believed to have come originally from the priory and to contain the blood of Thomas Becket. It is {{believed that it was}} moved to St Paul's for safe keeping {{at the time of the}} Dissolution of the Monasteries <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. The first building had been completed by 1242 as it is described in a letter to Jocelin of Wells. The foundation was confirmed by Edward II in 1325. It was home to a small community of Victorine Canons. The Victorine order were founded at the Abbey of St. Victor, Paris and founded St Augustine's Abbey in Bristol which became Bristol Cathedral. Members of the priory were influenced by the Cistercians who emphasised manual labour and self-sufficiency so that the clerks who had taken holy orders worked on the farm. The priory also provided the clergy for the local parish Church of St Paul, Kewstoke.|$|E
