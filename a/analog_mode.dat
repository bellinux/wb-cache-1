40|$|The {{choice of}} x-ray {{detectors}} presents {{a challenge for}} scanning transmission x-ray microscopes (STXM). The ultimate detector for the ALS STXMs should {{have a very high}} efficiency over a wide energy range, single photon counting capabilities up to 1 GHz, high rejection of red laser light, fast response, and work in both vacuum and at atmospheric pressure. The results of an investigation using a photomultiplier tube (PMT) with a number of different scintillators are presented.

40|$|A high {{performance}} near infrared sensitive photomultiplier tube was procured and evaluated {{with emphasis on}} those characteristics affecting its use over the very large amplitude range of signals encountered by an airborne lidar intended for mapping the distribution of stratospheric aerosols. A cathode quantum efficiency of 4. 3 percent at 1. 06 micrometer wavelength and a background count of less than 10, 000 per second were realized. It is recommended that the tube be stored and operated at a temperature near - 20 C, or cooler. Performance was found acceptable for the application in both pulse counting and <b>analog</b> <b>modes,</b> but careful design, probably including dynamic gain control, {{will be required to}} effectively utilize both modes on the same lidar shot...|$|R

30|$|One of {{the reasons}} for this state of things is the fact that as long as {{electronic}} publishing simply digitally emulates traditional <b>analog</b> publication <b>modes</b> it remains of little specific scholarly interest; it requires a very complex technical machinery for modeling the complex scholarly publication formats without yielding sufficient added value.|$|R

50|$|On November 20, 1997, Sony {{released}} {{their third}} analog controller to the market: the DualShock. The controller featured similar twin analog {{sticks to the}} Dual Analog, although they featured convex rubber tips rather than concave plastic ones.

50|$|WTAE-TV {{operates}} a 9250-watt digital broadcast translator on channel 22 to cover {{portions of the}} northern Pittsburgh area which were unable to receive channel 4's digital signal.

50|$|The display {{controller}} has two RAMDACs {{which are used}} to drive the VGA or the DVI ports in <b>analog</b> <b>mode</b> (for example, when a DVI-to-VGA converter {{is attached to a}} DVI port), a maximum of six digital transmitters that can output either a DisplayPort signal or a TMDS signal which is used for either DVI or HDMI, and two clock signal generators needed to drive the digital outputs in TMDS mode. Dual-link DVI displays use two of the TMDS/DisplayPort transmitters and one clock signal each. Single-link DVI displays and HDMI displays use one TMDS/DisplayPort transmitter and one clock signal each. DisplayPort displays use one TMDS/DisplayPort transmitter and no clock signal.|$|E
50|$|Epsilon TV, from 1995 until August 2014 was {{transmitting}} in <b>Analog</b> <b>Mode</b> from Parnes Mountain of Attica (UHF CH22), from Chlomon Mountain of Fthiotida (UHF CH51), from Profit Elias of Livadeia (UHF CH55) {{and from}} Parnassus Mountain (UHF CH62).

50|$|In April 2006, GM {{notified}} approximately 500,000 {{of their}} OnStar customers who had analog service that their service would be terminated effective December 31, 2007, because starting February 18, 2008 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{would no longer}} require US cell phone systems to operate in <b>analog</b> <b>mode.</b> Customers who purchased a prepaid, non-refundable, non-transferable 1-year OnStar Safe & Sound subscription were scheduled to receive an equipment upgrade. If the vehicle is from the 2003, 2004, or 2005 model year, an adapter costing approximately US$200 (includes a one-year subscription) can be installed at the customer's expense. If it is older, it will simply no longer be usable. A law firm in Pennsylvania representing some of the affected customers sought to have a class certified for a class action lawsuit for damages claimed in the cancellation of OnStar service.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{advantages}} of using digital voice modes {{are that it}} uses less bandwidth than older <b>analog</b> voice <b>modes</b> such as amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, and single sideband. The quality of the data received is also better than an analog signal at the same signal strength, {{as long as the}} signal is above a minimum threshold and {{as long as there is}} no multipath propagation.|$|R
5000|$|The VX8100 {{received}} mix reviews. Some {{compared it}} unfavorably to its predecessor, the VX8000, because the VX8100 was heavier, had a shorter battery life, a protruding antenna, a smaller screen, {{and did not}} include an <b>analog</b> compatibility <b>mode</b> Another source of criticism {{was that there were}} four different firmware versions of the phone - none of which were marked on the box - which made for inconsistent consumer experiences.|$|R
50|$|When the bitrate {{is too low}} {{to encode}} the audio without {{perceptible}} loss, Vorbis exhibits an <b>analog</b> noise-like failure <b>mode,</b> which {{can be described as}} reverberations in a room or amphitheater.

50|$|The HSDL4220 {{infrared}} LED is originally {{unsuitable for}} 10 Mbit/s operation. It has a bandwidth of 9 MHz, where 10 Mbit/s Manchester-modulated systems need bandwidth of around 16 MHz. Operation in a usual circuit with current drive {{would lead to}} substantial signal corruption and range reduction. Therefore, Twibright Labs developed a special driving technique consisting of driving the LED directly with 15-fold 74AC04 gate output in parallel with RF voltage applied current-unlimited directly to the LED through large capacitors. As the voltage to keep the nominal LED average current (100mA) varies with temperature and component tolerances, an AC-bypassed current sense resistor is put in series with the LED. A feedback loop measures voltage on this resistor and keeps it at a preset level by varying supply voltage of the 74AC04 gates. Therefore, the nominally digital 74AC04 is operating as a structured power CMOS switch completely in <b>analog</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Logitech Cordless Action {{controller}} is an officially licensed {{wireless controller}} for the PlayStation 2 made by Logitech. It features {{all of the}} inputs found the standard DualShock 2 controller, i.e. ten analog (pressure-sensitive) buttons ( [...] , , , , L1, R1, L2, R2, Start and Select), three digital button (L3, R3 and the <b>analog</b> <b>mode</b> button) and two analog sticks. As its buttons are pressure-sensitive, the controller is compatible with games which require a DualShock 2. The controller also features two vibration motors for haptic feedback, which are compatible with DualShock/DualShock 2 enabled games. As a power saving measure, the vibration may be turned on or off by the user {{by way of a}} button on the controller's face. It is powered by two AA batteries. It communicates with the console using a proprietary 2.4 GHz RF protocol wireless by way of a dongle which connects to the PS2's controller port in a similar manner to Nintendo's WaveBird wireless controller.|$|E
50|$|Digital {{transceivers}} {{take the}} strength of the signal and the emitted dipole flux pattern and compute distance and direction to the buried transceiver. In order to calculate the emitted dipole flux pattern, a digital transceiver must have at least two antennas, although most modern transceivers have three. The digital beacons will then indicate the direction to the victim's beacon as an arrow on the display, and provide audio cues such as varying pitch or frequency. Most low- to mid-range beacons have a segmented arrow capable of pointing in five to eight forward directions only, displaying a 'U-Turn' indicator if the user is traveling away from the victim. Higher end beacons such as the Mammut짰 Pulse Barryvox and Arva짰 Link are equipped with a digital compass and free-flowing arrow, facilitating more exact direction finding, even rotating to maintain direction between pulses of the transmitting beacon (a feature that is impossible without a digital compass or sophisticated accelerometer). In addition, many higher end beacons can point to victims 360째, including behind the user if the user is moving in the wrong direction. Many digital beacons are also capable of being used in <b>analog</b> <b>mode</b> for more advanced rescuers, or to enhance reception range.|$|E
