5|$|International {{emergency}} medicine is a subspecialty of {{emergency medicine}} that focuses {{not only on}} the global practice of emergency medicine but also on efforts to promote the growth of emergency care as a branch of medicine throughout the world. The term international emergency medicine generally refers to the transfer of skills and knowledgeincluding knowledge of ambulance operations and other aspects of prehospital carefrom developed emergency medical systems (EMSs) to those systems which are less developed. However, this definition has been criticized as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally. From this point of view, international emergency medicine is better described as the training required for <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of practicing the specialty outside of one's native country.|$|E

Sedgwick uses a cosmopolitan framework {{to shed light}} on American character and national identity in the early republic by exploring America's relationship with Britain and France.

25|$|Unger's {{model of}} {{philosophical}} practice {{is closest to}} those philosophers who sought to form {{a view of the}} whole of reality, and to do so by using and resisting the specialized knowledge of their time. It has been read as a form of pragmatism, but also as an attempt to disengage ideas and experiences that developed in the West under the influence of Christianity from the categories of Greek philosophy. His thought has been called the inverse of Schopenhauer's philosophy, affirming the supreme value of life <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> and depth of the self and eschewing fecklessness.|$|E

It is, however, still essential, for example in order to calculate the assimilation rate. Statistics Canada defines mother tongue as the {{first language}} learned in childhood and still spoken; it does not presuppose literacy in that or any language.|$|E

25|$|In the 21st century, {{the city}} has been working on new {{projects}} to restore itself as the strategic capital within the country. Rapid urban growth, including the mass migration of peasants to the main cities, attracted by economic development, has led to the demand of numerous proposals to accommodate such growth. Barranquilla has always been famous for its chaotic urban planning, understandable given its spontaneous origin as a port <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of high administrative corruption which has hampered the channeling of resources for building an urban centre of greater structure and dimensions. The presentation of a new infrastructure, changes in local and regional administration, decentralization since 1991, international pressure to open markets, and competition between the other major Colombian cities will bring about considerable development in Barranquilla into the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|The British {{government}} learned initially of 47 deaths after {{a routine}} {{visit to the}} camp by the Swiss authorities as the protecting power in May; the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden announced this news to the House of Commons on 19 May 1944. Shortly after the announcement the Senior British Officer of the camp, Group Captain Herbert Massey, was repatriated to England due to ill health. Upon his return, he informed the Government about {{the circumstances of the}} escape <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of the murder of the recaptured escapees. With the information received from Massey along with the official notification of the 50 deaths from the German Government, Eden updated Parliament on 23 June, promising that, {{at the end of the}} war, those responsible would be brought to exemplary justice.|$|E
25|$|However, since 2001 {{the civil}} society in the three {{southern}} Thai provinces has experienced a widespread imposition of legalistic Salafi norms <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> {{on the ground is}} today very different from what it was in former southern Thailand. Salafism has heavily eroded Patani cultural identity and current insurgent groups have extreme religious goals, such as an Islamic Caliphate, to the detriment of Patani nationalism. Although some of the present-day insurgents are very likely former PULO members, it is still unclear whether they fight for PULO's cause and it is likely that many may have become part of the more active and religious organisations that have overtaken PULO. In recent years PULO's leadership has largely lost control over its insurgents and has a very limited overall degree of influence over the insurgency in southern Thailand.|$|E

25|$|Like Louverture, Jean-Baptiste Belley {{was also}} an active {{participant}} in the colony's insurrection. The portrait of Belley by Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson depicts a man who encompasses the French view of its colonies. The portrait creates a stark dichotomy between the refinement of French Enlightenment thought <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of the situation in Saint Domingue, through the bust of Raynald and the figure of Belley, respectively. While distinguished, the portrait still portrays a man trapped by the confines of race. Girodet's portrayal of the former National Convention deputy is telling of the French opinion of colonial citizens by emphasizing the subject's sexuality and including an earring. Both of these racially charged symbols reveal the desire to undermine the colony's attempts at independent legitimacy, as citizens of the colonies were not able to access the elite class of French Revolutionaries because of their race.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{publication}} of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859, {{the position of the}} Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has slowly been refined. For about 100 years, there was no authoritative pronouncement on the subject, though many hostile comments were made by local church figures. In contrast with many Protestant objections, Catholic issues with evolutionary theory have {{had little to do with}} maintaining the literalism of the account in the Book of Genesis, and have always been concerned with the question of how man came to have a soul. Modern Creationism has had little Catholic support. In the 1950s, the Church's position was one of neutrality; by the late 20th century its position evolved to one of general acceptance in recent years. However, the church insists that the human soul was immediately infused by God, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of a single ancestor (commonly called monogenism) for the human race.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists such as William James {{initially}} {{used the}} term motivation to refer to intention, in a sense similar {{to the concept of}} will in European philosophy. With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct also came {{to be seen as a}} primary source of motivation. According to drive theory, the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence. Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as physical demands made by the organism on the nervous system. However, they believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche. Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> principle, roughly corresponding to id and ego. Later, in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud introduced the concept of the death drive, a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and psychic repetition of traumatic events. Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking. Clark Hull formalized the latter idea with his drive reduction model.|$|E
