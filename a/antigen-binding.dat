5|$|Though {{the general}} {{structure}} of all antibodies is very similar, a small region {{at the tip}} of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or <b>antigen-binding</b> sites, to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibody paratopes on the <b>antigen-binding</b> fragments allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. The large and diverse population of antibody paratope is generated by random recombination events of a set of gene segments that encode different <b>antigen-binding</b> sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. This recombinational process that produces clonal antibody paratope diversity is called V(D)J or VJ recombination. Basically, the antibody paratope is polygenic, made up of three genes, V, D, and J. Each paratope locus is also polymorphic, such that during antibody production, one allele of V, one of D, and one of J is chosen. These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope. The regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hyper variable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis.|$|E
5|$|Some {{parts of}} an {{antibody}} {{have the same}} functions. The arms of the Y, for example, contain the sites that can bind to antigens (in general, identical) and, therefore, recognize specific foreign objects. This region of the antibody is called the Fab (fragment, <b>antigen-binding)</b> region. It is composed of one constant and one variable domain from each heavy and light chain of the antibody.|$|E
5|$|This {{serves to}} {{increase}} {{the diversity of the}} antibody pool and impacts the antibody's <b>antigen-binding</b> affinity. Some point mutations will result in the production of antibodies that have a weaker interaction (low affinity) with their antigen than the original antibody, and some mutations will generate antibodies with a stronger interaction (high affinity). B cells that express high affinity antibodies on their surface will receive a strong survival signal during interactions with other cells, whereas those with low affinity antibodies will not, and will die by apoptosis. Thus, B cells expressing antibodies with a higher affinity for the antigen will outcompete those with weaker affinities for function and survival allowing the average affinity of antibodies to increase over time. The process of generating antibodies with increased binding affinities is called affinity maturation. Affinity maturation occurs in mature B cells after V(D)J recombination, and is dependent on help from helper T cells.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are glycoproteins {{belonging}} to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may {{be attached to the}} <b>antigen-binding</b> fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five isotypes. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region. The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. For example, IgE is responsible for an allergic response consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release. IgE's Fab paratope binds to allergic antigen, for example house dust mite particles, while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.|$|E
25|$|Each {{recombined}} TCR possess unique antigen specificity, {{determined by}} {{the structure of the}} <b>antigen-binding</b> site formed by the α and β chains in case of αβ T cells or γ and δ chains on case of γδ T cells.|$|E
25|$|Idiotype Cross-Reaction – Idiotypes are {{antigenic}} epitopes {{found in}} the <b>antigen-binding</b> portion (Fab) of the immunoglobulin molecule. Plotz and Oldstone presented evidence that autoimmunity can arise {{as a result of}} a cross-reaction between the idiotype on an antiviral antibody and a host cell receptor for the virus in question. In this case, the host-cell receptor is envisioned as an internal image of the virus, and the anti-idiotype antibodies can react with the host cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{variable}} (V) {{domain of}} light chains {{has a high}} degree of structural diversity, particularly the <b>antigen-binding</b> region. In addition, the first 23 amino acids of the 1st variable domain framework region have a number of variations known as subgroups. Four kappa (Vκ1–Vκ4) and six lambda subgroups (Vλ1–Vλ6) can be identified. The specific subgroup structures influence the potential of the free light chains to polymerise such that AL amyloidosis is associated with Vλ6 and light-chain deposition disease with Vκ1 and Vκ4.|$|E
2500|$|The {{large extent}} of {{variability}} in HLA genes poses significant challenges in investigating {{the role of}} HLA genetic variations in diseases. Disease association studies typically treat each HLA allele as a single complete unit, which does not illuminate {{the parts of the}} molecule associated with disease. Karp D. R. et al. describes a novel sequence feature variant type (SFVT) approach for HLA genetic analysis that categorizes HLA proteins into biologically relevant smaller sequence features (SFs), and their variant types (VTs). Sequence features are combinations of amino acid sites defined based on structural information (e.g., beta-sheet 1), functional information (e.g., peptide <b>antigen-binding),</b> and polymorphism. These sequence features can be overlapping and continuous or discontinuous in the linear sequence. Variant types for each sequence feature are defined based upon all known polymorphisms in the HLA locus being described. SFVT categorization of HLA is applied in genetic association analysis so that the effects and roles of the epitopes shared by several HLA alleles can be identified. Sequence features and their variant types have been described for all classical HLA proteins; the international repository of HLA SFVTs will be maintained at IMGT/HLA database. [...] A tool to convert HLA alleles into their component SFVTs {{can be found on the}} Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) website.|$|E

50|$|These {{molecules}} {{were created}} to facilitate phage display, where it is highly convenient to express the <b>antigen-binding</b> domain as a single peptide. As an alternative, scFv can be created directly from subcloned heavy and light chains derived from a hybridoma. ScFvs have many uses, e.g., flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and as <b>antigen-binding</b> domains of artificial T cell receptors.|$|E
5000|$|An {{idiotope}} is {{the unique}} set of antigenic determinants (epitopes) of the variable portion of an antibody. In some cases {{it can be the}} actual <b>antigen-binding</b> site, and in some cases it may comprise variable region sequences outside of the <b>antigen-binding</b> site on the antibody itself. Thus each antibody would have multiple idiotopes; and the set of these individual idiotopes is termed the idiotype of the antibody.|$|E
50|$|The <b>antigen-binding</b> (Fab) {{fragment}} is {{a region}} on an antibody that binds to antigens. It {{is composed of}} one constant and one variable domain {{of each of the}} heavy and the light chain. The variable domain contains the paratope (the <b>antigen-binding</b> site), comprising a set of complementarity determining regions, at the amino terminal end of the monomer. Each arm of the Y thus binds an epitope on the antigen.|$|E
50|$|In a new {{development}} {{in the field of}} antibody-based therapeutics, the Fc region of immunoglobulins has been engineered to contain an <b>antigen-binding</b> site. This type of <b>antigen-binding</b> fragment is called Fcab. Fcab fragments can be inserted into a full immunoglobulin by swapping the Fc region, thus obtaining a bispecific antibody (with both Fab and Fcab regions containing distinct binding sites). These bispecific monoclonal antibodies are sometimes referred to as mAb2.|$|E

50|$|Two {{chemically}} linked fragments <b>antigen-binding</b> form {{an artificial}} antibody that binds to two different antigens, {{making it a}} type of bispecific antibody. They are fragments <b>antigen-binding</b> (Fab or Fab') of two different monoclonal antibodies and are linked by chemical means like a thioether. Typically, one of the Fabs binds to a tumour antigen (such as CD30) {{and the other to}} a protein on the surface of an immune cell, for example an Fc receptor on a macrophage. In this way, tumour cells are attached to immune cells, which destroy them.|$|E

50|$|Because the <b>antigen-binding</b> groove of MHC class II {{molecules}} is open at {{both ends}} while the corresponding groove on class I molecules is closed at each end, the antigens presented by MHC class II molecules are longer, generally between 15 and 24 amino acid residues long.|$|E

50|$|In antibodies, hypervariable regions {{form the}} <b>antigen-binding</b> site and are found on both light and heavy chains. They also {{contribute}} to the specificity of each antibody.

5000|$|... #Caption: There {{are three}} basic {{variants}} of immunoglobulin antigens in humans that share {{a very similar}} chemical structure but are distinctly different.

Notice the O-type antigen does not have a binding site.|$|E
50|$|Each {{antibody}} has {{at least}} two <b>antigen-binding</b> sites, therefore antibodies are bivalent to multivalent. Avidity (functional affinity) is the accumulated strength of multiple affinities. For example IgM {{is said to have}} low affinity but high avidity because it has 10 weak binding sites for antigen as opposed to the 2 stronger binding sites of IgG, IgE and IgD with higher single binding affinities.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} underlying abacavir {{hypersensitivity syndrome}} {{is related to}} the change in the HLA-B*5701 protein product. Abacavir binds with high specificity to the HLA-B*5701 protein, changing the shape and chemistry of the <b>antigen-binding</b> cleft. This results in a change in immunological tolerance and the subsequent activation of abacavir-specific cytotoxic T cells, which produce a systemic reaction known as abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Avidity is {{commonly}} applied to antibody interactions in which multiple <b>antigen-binding</b> sites simultaneously {{interact with the}} target antigenic epitopes, often in multimerized structures. Individually, each binding interaction may be readily broken; however, when many binding interactions are present at the same time, transient unbinding of a single site does not allow the molecule to diffuse away, and binding of that weak interaction {{is likely to be}} restored.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of transferases, {{specifically}} those transferring a phosphate group to the sidechain oxygen atom of serine or threonine residues in proteins (protein-serine/threonine kinases).
