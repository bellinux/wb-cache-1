5|$|Late one night, Ashley (Ashley Ryder)– <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> childlike mentality– {{arrives at}} the caravan home of his Uncle David (David Hoyle) on the Isle of Sheppey. Ashley confides in his uncle that his mother has been {{physically}} abusing him by stubbing cigarettes out on his hand. David lambasts the mother and society in general; the two embrace in a kiss {{before going to bed}} together. The next morning, they awake and have breakfast in bed before David bathes Ashley in the bathtub, telling him a story about an unhappy nuclear family. Going to a local café and then a park bench, David continues to explain his anti-establishment opinions about society. Ashley reveals that he wants to die, and the two express their love for one another.|$|E
25|$|A highly fictionalized {{version of}} Balian {{is the main}} {{character}} of the 2005 film Kingdom of Heaven, played by Orlando Bloom as <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> questioning sensibility regarding religion and social attitudes. In the film, Balian's father, a fictional character named Godfrey the Baron of Ibelin (played by Liam Neeson), returns to Europe to find Balian, his long-lost illegitimate son, who is a blacksmith in France, and encourages {{him to come to}} the Holy Land as his heir. Balian is portrayed as having a love affair with Sibylla (this is possibly derived from the Old French Continuation of William of Tyres claims about her and Baldwin). The film depicts Balian as the sole commander of the defence of Jerusalem, and instead of working in close alliance with Patriarch Eraclius, Balian is depicted as his rival. In the film's coda, Balian returns to France (with Sibylla) where he meets Richard I of England, who rides up to Balian and says to him that he is looking for Balian, the defender of Jerusalem, to which Balian replies that he is a blacksmith. After some time passes Balian and Sibylla are seen to be riding up the crossroads his father had used when returning from Jerusalem.|$|E

2500|$|His work in Bergamo, the westernmost town of the Venetian republic, was {{to prove}} his best and most {{productive}} artistic period, when he received many commissions from wealthy merchants, well educated professionals and local aristocrats. He had become a rich colourist and an experienced draughtsman, who also developed {{the concept of the}} psychological portrait that revealed the thoughts and emotions of his subjects. In this he was continuing the tradition begun by Antonello da Messina and a good example would be his Portrait of <b>a</b> <b>Young</b> <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Book ( [...] now in the Accademia, Venice [...] ).|$|E

I saw a picture of shapes and underlying that the feeling I had about life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michigan's offense {{finished}} with 461 net yards {{and was so}} dominant that it registered more touchdowns (12) than first downs (11). Despite Michigan's extensive use of reserves {{through most of the}} game, Michigan's 85 points was the highest total by a Michigan team since Fielding H. Yost's Point-a-Minute teams and the worst defeat {{in the history of the}} Chicago Maroons football program. The Chicago Tribune found no fault with Michigan for running up the score, noting that the first string played only 20 minutes, and adding: [...] "You can't expect <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> clear field before him to pause and tie his shoelaces or pass the time of day with a Maroon." ...|$|E

However, he later claimed that he had told this story so many times that he had forgotten the incident itself, and only remembered himself telling the story. His friends are quoted as saying that Adams mentioned the idea of [...] "hitch-hiking around the galaxy" [...] to them while on holiday in Greece in 1973.|$|E
2500|$|In this way, between 1764 and 1781 Catherine the Great {{acquired}} {{six major}} collections: those of Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky; Heinrich von Brühl; Pierre Crozat; Horace Walpole; Sylvestre-Raphael Baudouin; and finally in 1787, the John Lyde-Brown collection. These large assemblies of art included works by such masters as Rembrandt, Rubens, Titian, Raphael, Tiepolo, van Dyck and Reni. The acquisition of 225 paintings forming the Gotzkowsky collection {{was a source}} of personal pride to Catherine. It had been put together by Gotzkowsky for Catherine's adversary, Frederick the Great of Prussia who, {{as a result of his}} wars with Russia, could not afford to pay for it. This collection included some great Flemish and Dutch works, most notably Frans Hals' [...] "Portrait of <b>a</b> <b>Young</b> <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Glove." [...] In 1769, the Bruhl collection brought to the Winter Palace two further works by Rembrandt, Portrait of a Scholar and Portrait of an Old Man in Red.|$|E
