The argument escalates and Liz orders {{them to stop}} their bickering. After Liz leaves for Chicago, Jenna and Tracy decide to conduct a social experiment to see whether Tracy can survive better as a white woman than Jenna can <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> after arguing respectively that black men and white women have it harder in society. Later, while on her flight, Liz takes Jack's sedative. Liz realizes that the woman {{sitting next to her}} is Oprah Winfrey. When Liz arrives back at the 30 Rock studios, Tracy is dressed in female drag with his body covered in white makeup and soon after, Jenna enters in blackface and male drag. Jack worries that the situation has gone out of control, but Liz assures him that Oprah, who is coming to the studios, {{will be able to make}} them come to terms. As it turns out, her inflight conversation with Oprah was a hallucination. The person who Liz thought was Oprah is actually a 12-year-old girl named Pam (Raven Goodwin). Even so, Pam engages Tracy and Jenna in a heart-to-heart, and manages to settle their differences.|$|E

The religious movement was initiated by repeated appearances of a mystic woman to several Roman Catholic members delivering messages about the incarnation of the son of God <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man.</b> These appearances are said to have begun around 1938, almost simultaneous with the beginning of Edel Quinne's lay catholic mission to Africa.|$|E
25|$|Claude McKay was a {{poet who}} flourished during the Harlem Renaissance, a major {{literary}} {{movement in the}} 1920s. During this time, McKay’s poems challenged white authority while celebrating Jamaican culture. He also wrote tales about the trials and tribulations of life <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> in both Jamaica and America. McKay was not secretive about his hatred for racism and felt that racist people were stupid and could not look past their shortsightedness and hatred. In tales like Home to Harlem', McKay depicts a culture in Harlem that is full of drug use, prostitution, {{and a variety of}} sexual encounters. His depiction was criticized as a negative portrayal of Harlem and its lower-class citizens by prominent figures such as W.E.B. DuBois, but was later applauded as a literary force in the Harlem Renaissance. McKay’s poetry brought awareness to the racist treatment that many black individuals faced.|$|E
500|$|Despite these findings, {{baseball}} historians still credit Walker {{with being}} {{the first in the}} major leagues to play openly <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man.</b> On the subject of White, John R. Husman wrote: [...] "He played baseball and lived his life as a white man. If White, who was also of white blood, said he was white and he was not challenged, he was white in his time and circumstances". To clear up the confusion between Walker and Robinson, Husman also pointed out that, while the two ball players endured their own trials with racism in baseball, Walker undoubtedly preceded Robinson in the major leagues.|$|E

500|$|In {{his last}} full {{season with the}} Indians in 1955, Doby was {{selected}} for his seventh consecutive and final All-Star Game. Doby's leg injuries affected him severely {{at this point in}} his career and he did not enter the game. He finished the 1955 season with 26 home runs and 75 RBIs while hitting [...]291 in 131 games, his fewest played since 1948. Not all in Cleveland were disappointed to see Doby leaving. Wrote one Plain Dealer columnist, Franklin Lewis: [...] "He has been a controversial athlete. Highly gifted, he was frequently morose, sullen, and upon occasion, downright surly to his teammates... He thought of himself, at the beginning, as the symbol of the Negro in his league." [...] Doby responded, [...] "I was looked on <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> <b>man,</b> not as a human being. I did feel a responsibility to the Black players who came after me, but that was a responsibility, basically, to people, not just to Black people." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} painting was set in a barbershop with patrons {{of a variety of}} religions and races all waiting their turn in the barber's chair. His first workup was a [...] oil on canvas depicting tolerance as [...] "the basis for a democracy's religious diversity". It included a Jew being served by a Protestant barber <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> and a Roman Catholic priest awaited the barber's services. The problem was painting easily recognizable depictions of different religions and races because there was little agreement on what a person of a certain religion should look like. However, as he attempted to clarify the characters' depictions he found himself resorting to offensive overexaggeration, especially of the non-clerical characters. Making a Jewish man appear stereotypically Semitic, making a white customer preppy and relegating the black man to agrarian workman attire bogged down the work without speaking on behalf of the government as it should. Rockwell's intended theme was religious tolerance, but he felt the original composition did not successfully make this point.|$|E
500|$|As on Mos Def's other albums, {{he spoke}} a {{dedication}} to God in Arabic ("Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Raheem") {{at the start}} of The Ecstatic, before [...] "Supermagic" [...] began with a sample of Malcolm X's 1964 speech at Oxford Union. The sample prefaced the album's [...] "small-globe statement", Pitchfork journalist Nate Patrin explained, indicating that Mos Def had [...] "a stake in something greater than just one corner of the rap world". Alex Young from Consequence of Sound believed the speech introduced [...] "a political album encompassing global beats and viewpoints". According to Washington Post critic Allison Stewart, Mos Def seemed equally interested in the Obama-era zeitgeist and accounts of the past, such as the early-1980s Bedford–Stuyvesant setting of [...] "Life in Marvelous Times". Young deemed the song anthemic for [...] "a seemingly paradoxical age that routinely sees events such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> <b>man</b> being elected president of a nation wallowing in racial inequality". From Christgau's perspective, Mos Def offered a credo in the lyrics: [...] "More of less than ever before / It's just too much more for your mind to absorb / It's scary like hell, but there's no doubt / We can't be alive in no time but now".|$|E

500|$|Those {{who opposed}} this {{resolution}} argued that its presence {{would cause the}} other, more rational resolutions to lose support. Others argued that only the social, civil and religious rights of women should be addressed, not the political rights. James and Lucretia Mott were against the resolution; Lucretia said to Stanton, [...] "Why Lizzie, thee will make us ridiculous." [...] Stanton defended the concept of woman suffrage, saying women would {{then be able to}} affect future legislation and gain further rights. Frederick Douglass, the only African American at the meeting, stood and spoke eloquently in favor; he said that he could not accept the right to vote himself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> if woman could not also claim that right. Douglass projected that the world would be a better place if women were involved in the political sphere. [...] "In this denial of the right to participate in government, not merely the degradation of woman and the perpetuation of a great injustice happens, but the maiming and repudiation of one-half of the moral and intellectual power of the government of the world." [...] Douglass's powerful words rang true with many in attendance, and the resolution passed by a large majority. Lucretia Mott spoke to end the session.|$|E
500|$|Race is a {{polarizing}} theme {{throughout the}} story. As William M. Morgan wrote, while the white characters are largely depicted as cold and humorless, {{and the black}} characters as warm and amusing, the town's racial hierarchy is omnipresent. Slavery is referred to several times throughout the story, as critic Nan Goodman noted; as a post-Civil War work, The Monster revisits slavery's legacy, {{as well as its}} effects on modern African Americans like Henry Johnson. At the beginning of the story, it is made clear that the white townspeople tolerate Henry because he [...] "behaves himself" [...] and [...] "knows his place" [...] <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man.</b> Later, when Henry struggles through the burning house to save Jimmie, it is said that [...] "he was submitting, submitting because of his fathers, bending his mind in a most perfect slavery to this conflagration." [...] However, while his suffering is central to the story, Henry Johnson is never really fleshed out as a character; before the fire, he [...] "strikes in quick succession the minstrel's poses of an old-time, happy-go-lucky Negro", who charms children and women alike. Despite his heroism, Morgan stated, Henry does not stray far from a racial stereotype. Critics such as Lillian Gilkes and John R. Cooley have noted Crane's lack of racial sensitivity while writing The Monster, although they note that the author was simply exhibiting [...] "unconscious racism" [...] in order to fulfill literary conventions of the late 19th century. [...] In his 2002 essay, [...] "Blunders of Virtue: The Problem of Race in Stephen Crane's 'The Monster'", John Clemen sums up the critics' tendency to either [...] "ignore the evidence of Crane's racism, to dismiss it as [...] a cultural influence irrelevant to his larger purposes, or to reconfigure it within his irony {{in such a way as}} to enable the story and its author to achieve an unintended racial insight." ...|$|E

2500|$|Johnson {{constantly}} flouted conventions {{regarding the}} social and economic [...] "place" [...] of blacks in American society. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> he broke a powerful taboo in consorting with white women, and would constantly and arrogantly verbally taunt men (both white and black) inside and outside the ring. Johnson was pompous about his affection for white women, and imperious about his physical prowess, {{both in and out of}} the ring. Asked the secret of his staying power by a reporter who had watched a succession of women parade into, and out of, the champion's hotel room, Johnson supposedly said [...] "Eat jellied eels and think distant thoughts".|$|E

In response to Holder's speech, Hanson wrote a column titled [...] "Facing Facts about Race" [...] where he offered up his own version (and others') of [...] "the Talk", namely the need to inform his children to be careful of young black men when venturing into the inner city, who Hanson argued were statistically more likely to commit violent crimes than young men of other races, and that therefore it was understandable for the police to focus on groups with the highest statistical crime rates, which turn out to be young black males.|$|E
2500|$|Griffith—indignant at the film's {{negative}} critical reception—wrote {{letters to}} newspapers and published a pamphlet {{in which he}} accused his critics of censoring unpopular opinions. [...] Griffith's 1916 pamphlet The Rise and Fall of a Free Speech in America used racialized language and images, such as a cartoon that depicted [...] "censorship" [...] as a monstrous black man with a lascivious {{expression on his face}} eyeing [...] "free speech" [...] who appeared as a white woman dressed in a white dress. [...] "Free Speech" [...] points at [...] "Censorship" [...] and says: [...] "All history, all reason condemns you: GO!". In his pamphlet, Griffith called censorship [...] "this malignant pygmy" [...] who had mutated into a fully grown [...] "Caliban" [...] (a character from William Shakespeare's play The Tempest who is often depicted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man).</b> When Sherwin Lewis of The New York Globe wrote a piece that expressed criticism of the film's distorted portrayal of history and said that it was not worthy of constitutional protection because its purpose was to make a few [...] "dirty dollars", Griffith responded that [...] "the public should not be afraid to accept the truth, even though it might not like it". He also added that the man who wrote the editorial was [...] "damaging my reputation as a producer" [...] and [...] "a liar and a coward". He conceived his next film, Intolerance (1916), as a response to those who had criticized his film.|$|E

50|$|Harris' first novel, Invisible Life {{finished}} in 1991, was a coming-of-age story dealing with then-taboo topics.

50|$|Throughout this process, the {{identity}} of Hughes <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> gay <b>man</b> is reclaimed and no longer denied, a process paralleled in the ever growing academic studies of Hughes today. Moreover, adding to the historic and cinematic importance of the film in gay cinema, Looking for Langston was {{and continues to be}} one of very few films showing intra-racial affection between <b>black</b> gay <b>men</b> as revealed in the love story between the two leading black protagonists, Ben Ellison as Langston Hughes and Matthew Baidoo as Beauty.|$|R
2500|$|In mid-1977, Mitchell {{began work}} on new {{recordings}} that became her first double studio album. Close to completing her contract with Asylum Records, Mitchell felt that this album could be looser in feel than any album she'd done in the past. She invited Pastorius back, and {{he brought with him}} fellow members of jazz fusion pioneers Weather Report, including drummer Don Alias and saxophonist Wayne Shorter. Layered, atmospheric compositions such as [...] "Overture/Cotton Avenue" [...] featured more improvisatory collaboration, while [...] "Paprika Plains" [...] was a 16-minute epic that stretched the boundaries of pop, owing more to Mitchell's memories of childhood in Canada and her study of classical music. [...] "Dreamland" [...] and [...] "The Tenth World", featuring Chaka Khan on backing vocals, were percussion-dominated tracks. Other songs continued the jazz-rock-folk collisions of Hejira. Mitchell also revived [...] "Jericho", written years earlier (a version is found on her 1974 live album) but never recorded in a studio setting. Don Juan's Reckless Daughter was released in December 1977. The album received mixed reviews but still sold relatively well, peaking at No. 25 in the US and going gold within three months. The cover of the album created its own controversy: Mitchell was featured in several photographs, including one where she was disguised <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> wearing a curly afro wig, a white suit and vest, and dark sunglasses. The character, whom she called Art Nouveau, was based on a pimp who, she says, once complimented her while walking down an LA street – and was a symbol of her turn toward jazz and streetwise lyrics.|$|E

5000|$|Black feminist scholar Treva Lindsey {{claims the}} ride or die chick is a {{challenge}} to a dominant narrative in hip hop that privileges homosocial male relationships and undermines heterosexual romantic bonds between men and women. Drawing on scholars Patricia Hill Collins and bell hooks she argues this love is not only personal, it is also an act of political rebellion because [...] "In a culture that claims black women are unlovable and undesirable, and <b>black</b> <b>men</b> are violent and irredeemable, it is considered [...] "rebellious" [...] when <b>black</b> <b>men</b> and women love each other." [...] Others have also argued that the [...] "ride or die" [...] narrative is a recognition of the disenfranchisement these couples face because of race and class and it is because of this systematic oppression that they feel it is them against the world. In this understanding by claiming to be a ride or die chick, a woman is not diminishing her own self-worth or inviting mistreatment, but symbolically invoking a politically-aware alliance. Her recognition that committing to this relationship will require her to ride or die is a statement about the difficulty her partner will likely face <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> living in <b>a</b> racist society.|$|R
