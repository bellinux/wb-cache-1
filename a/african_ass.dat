50|$|Based {{on ancient}} drawings, the Atlas wild ass had stripes on its legs {{as well as}} a {{shoulder}} cross. Of the living subspecies of <b>African</b> wild <b>ass,</b> the Somali wild ass has only leg stripes, and the Nubian wild ass only the shoulder stripe. One or both features appear sometimes in the domestic donkey, the domestic descendant of the <b>African</b> wild <b>asses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Four {{species are}} {{considered}} critically endangered: the Javan rhino, the Sumatran rhinoceros, the black rhino and the <b>African</b> wild <b>ass.</b>|$|R
25|$|Few {{species of}} ass {{exist in the}} wild. The <b>African</b> wild <b>ass,</b> Equus africanus, has two subspecies, the Somali wild ass, Equus africanus somaliensis, and the Nubian wild ass, Equus africanus africanus, the {{principal}} ancestor of the domestic donkey. Both are critically endangered. Extinct species include the European ass, Equus hydruntinus, which became extinct during the Neolithic, and the North <b>African</b> wild <b>ass,</b> Equus africanus atlanticus, which became extinct in Roman times.|$|R
50|$|Different authors {{consider}} the <b>African</b> wild <b>ass</b> and the domesticated donkey {{one or two}} species; either view is technically legitimate, though the former is phylogenetically more accurate.|$|R
50|$|The Somali {{wild ass}} (Equus africanus somaliensis) is a {{subspecies}} of the <b>African</b> wild <b>ass.</b> It {{is found in}} Somalia, the Southern Red Sea region of Eritrea, and the Afar Region of Ethiopia.|$|R
50|$|The Asiatic {{wild ass}} {{is larger than}} <b>African</b> wild <b>ass</b> at about 290 kg and 2.1 m (head-body length). They are reddish-brown or yellowish-brown in color and have broad dorsal stripe on {{the middle of the}} back. Unlike most horses and donkeys, onagers have never been domesticated. They are among the fastest mammals, as they can run as fast as 64 km/h (40 mph) to 70 km/h (43 mph). The onager is closely related to the <b>African</b> wild <b>ass,</b> as they both shared the same ancestor. The kiang, {{formerly}} considered a subspecies of Equus hemionus, diverged from the Asiatic wild ass and has been acknowledged as a distinct species.|$|R

50|$|Genetic {{evidence}} {{also indicates}} that donkeys were domesticated from the <b>African</b> wild <b>ass.</b> Archaeologists have found donkey burials in early Dynastic contexts dating to ~5000 BP at Abydos, Middle Egypt, and examination of the bones shows that they were used as beasts of burden.|$|R
25|$|This wild donkey (Equus africanus somalicus) is a {{subspecies}} of the <b>African</b> wild <b>ass.</b> Zoo Basel coordinates the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) of the Somali wild ass, {{which is}} on the Red List of critically endangered species as there are likely less than 3000 animals in the wild.|$|R
50|$|The park lets animals roam freely while {{visitors}} {{drive through}} their enclosures. The species {{held in the}} park include rhinoceros, elands, scimitar horned oryx, addax, gemsbok, giraffes, Ankoles, zebras, <b>African</b> wild <b>asses,</b> elephants, camels, bisons, bongo, lions, tigers, Canadian timber wolves, black bears, patas monkeys and Barbary apes.|$|R

25|$|The Somali {{wild ass}} (Equus africanus somalicus) is a wild donkey, a {{subspecies}} of the <b>African</b> wild <b>ass.</b> It is extremely endangered, {{as there are}} likely less than 1000 animals (or even 700) in the wild. There are about 200 individuals in zoos around the globe, of which 35 were born in Basel.|$|R
25|$|The Afar Depression biome is {{characterized}} as desert scrubland. Vegetation is mostly confined to drought-resistant {{plants such as}} small trees (e.g. species of the dragon tree), shrubs, and grasses. Wildlife includes many herbivores such as Grevy's zebra, Soemmering's gazelle, beisa and, notably, the last viable population of <b>African</b> wild <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus somalicus).|$|R
50|$|Afar {{is home to}} {{peculiar}} wild life, which notably {{include the}} <b>African</b> wild <b>ass,</b> Grevy's zebra, wild fox, wild cat, cheetah, and ostrich.

5000|$|The Nubian {{wild ass}} (Equus africanus africanus) is the {{nominate}} subspecies of <b>African</b> wild <b>ass,</b> {{and one of}} the ancestors of the domestic donkey, which was domesticated about 6,000 years ago. It is presumed to be Extinct, though two populations potentially survive on the Caribbean island of Bonaire and in Gebel Elba.|$|R
50|$|The Atlas {{wild ass}} (Equus africanus atlanticus), {{also known as}} Algerian wild ass, is a purported extinct {{subspecies}} of the <b>African</b> wild <b>ass</b> that was once found across North Africa {{and parts of the}} Sahara. It was last represented in a villa mural ca.300 AD in Bona, Algeria, and became extinct as a result of Roman sport hunting.|$|R
25|$|Leg {{bars are}} {{prominent}} on Grevy's zebras and mountain zebras, and <b>African</b> wild <b>asses</b> also have well-defined black leg bars below the forearm and gaskin {{on a white}} or pale background. However, as in horses, expression of leg bars seems to vary widely among donkeys, plains zebras, and Przewalski's horses, while they appear very seldom {{or not at all}} in onagers and kiangs.|$|R
2500|$|Asses {{were first}} domesticated around 3000BC, {{probably}} in Egypt or Mesopotamia, [...] and have {{spread around the}} world. They continue to fill important roles in many places today.

50|$|The Somali {{wild ass}} {{is one of}} two {{subspecies}} of <b>African</b> wild <b>ass,</b> the other being the Nubian wild ass. Domesticated more than 6,000 years ago in northern Africa, wild ass is thought to be the origin species for donkeys. The Somali wild ass's remaining wild population of fewer than 2,000 is found in small, scattered pockets of western Africa.|$|R
50|$|The {{species name}} for the <b>African</b> wild <b>ass</b> is {{sometimes}} given as asinus, from the domestic donkey, whose specific name is older and usually would have priority. But this usage is erroneous since the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature has conserved the name Equus africanus in Opinion 2027. This was done to prevent the confusing situation of the phylogenetic ancestor being taxonomically included in its descendant.|$|R
50|$|While the {{existence}} of several rock art depictions and Roman mosaics leave {{no doubt about the}} former existence of <b>African</b> wild <b>asses</b> in North Africa, it has been claimed that the original bones that were used to describe the subspecies atlanticus actually belonged to a fossil zebra. Therefore, the name E. a. atlanticus might not be valid to refer to the Atlas wild ass.|$|R
25|$|Lions {{are said}} to inhabit the {{mountains}} of the Gash-Barka Region. There is also a small population of African bush elephants that roam {{in some parts of}} the country. Dik-diks can also be found in many areas. The endangered <b>African</b> wild <b>ass</b> can be seen in Denakalia Region. Other local wildlife include bushbuck, duikers, greater kudu, Klipspringer, African leopards, oryx and crocodiles., The spotted hyena is widespread and fairly common.|$|R
50|$|The Grévy’s zebra largely inhabits {{northern}} Kenya, {{with some}} isolated populations in Ethiopia. It was extirpated from Somalia and Djibouti and its status in South Sudan is uncertain. It lives in Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and barren plains. Ecologically, this species is intermediate between the arid-living <b>African</b> wild <b>ass</b> and the water-dependent plains zebra. Lactating females and non-territorial males use areas with green, short grass and medium, dense bush {{more often than}} non-lactating females and territorial males.|$|R
50|$|The Indian wild ass, as {{with most}} other Asian wild ass subspecies, is quite {{different}} from the <b>African</b> wild <b>ass</b> species. The coat is usually sandy, but varies from reddish grey, fawn, to pale chestnut. The animal possesses an erect, dark mane which runs from the back of the head and along the neck. The mane is then followed by a dark brown stripe running along the back, to the root of the tail.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> wild <b>ass</b> is {{primarily}} {{active in the}} cooler hours between late afternoon and early morning, seeking shade and shelter amongst the rocky hills during the day. The Somali wild ass is also very agile and nimble-footed, capable of moving quickly across boulder fields and in the mountains. On the flat, it has been recorded reaching speeds of 70 km/h (43 mph). In keeping with these feats, its soles are particularly hard and its hooves grow very quickly.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> wild <b>ass</b> or <b>African</b> wild donkey (Equus africanus) is a wild {{member of}} the horse family, Equidae. This species is {{believed}} to be the ancestor of the domestic donkey, which is usually placed within the same species. They live in the deserts and other arid areas of the Horn of Africa, in Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia. It formerly had a wider range north and west into Sudan, Egypt, and Libya. About 570 individuals exist in the wild.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the species}} itself is under no threat of extinction, due to {{abundant}} domestic stock (donkey and burros), the two extant wild subspecies are both listed as critically endangered. <b>African</b> wild <b>asses</b> have been captured for domestication for centuries, and this, along with interbreeding between wild and domestic animals, {{has caused a}} distinct decline in population numbers. There are now {{only a few hundred}} individuals left in the wild. These animals are also hunted for food and for traditional medicine in both Ethiopia and Somalia. Competition with domestic livestock for grazing, and restricted access to water supplies caused by agricultural developments, pose further threats to the survival of this species. The <b>African</b> wild <b>ass</b> is legally protected in the countries where it is currently found, although these measures often prove difficult to enforce. A protected population of the Somali wild ass exists in the Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve in Israel, to the north of Eilat. This reserve was established in 1968 with the view to bolster populations of endangered desert species. Populations of horses and asses are fairly resilient and, if the species is properly protected, it may well recover from its current low.|$|R
25|$|The donkey or ass (Equus africanus asinus) is a domesticated {{member of}} the horse family, Equidae. The wild {{ancestor}} of the donkey is the <b>African</b> wild <b>ass,</b> E. africanus. The donkey {{has been used as}} a working animal for at least 5000 years. There are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in underdeveloped countries, where they are used principally as draught or pack animals. Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels. Small numbers of donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries.|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{examined}} the scent marking behaviour by urine and faeces in four equid species, <b>African</b> wild <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus), Grevy?s zebra (Equus grevyi), Plain zebra (Equus quagga) and Mountain zebra (Equus zebra), in captivity. Data about scent marking were collected during two five-month seasons of behavioural observation of 15 equid herds in 5 Czech Zoos, Zoo Dvůr Králové, Zoo Liberec, Zoo Brno, Zoo Ostrava and Zoo Ústí nad Labem. The study focused mainly on testing several hypotheses explaining scent marking in stallions, mares and foals {{and also on}} interspecies differences in this behaviour...|$|R
