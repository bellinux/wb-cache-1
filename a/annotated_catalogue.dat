He brought Ouyang with him by {{offering}} him a choice position on his staff. [...] Ouyang’s refusal won him further praise as a principled public servant who {{was not willing to}} take advantage of connections. Instead, Ouyang was brought to the court in 1041 to prepare an <b>annotated</b> <b>catalogue</b> of the Imperial Library.|$|E
2500|$|Osler was a {{prolific}} author {{and a great}} collector of books and other material relevant {{to the history of}} medicine. He willed his library to the Faculty of Medicine of McGill University where it now forms the nucleus of McGill University's Osler Library of the History of Medicine, which opened in 1929. The printed and extensively <b>annotated</b> <b>catalogue</b> of this donation is entitled [...] "Bibliotheca Osleriana: a catalogue of books illustrating the history of medicine and science, collected, arranged and annotated by Sir William Osler, Bt. and bequeathed to McGill University". Osler was a strong supporter of libraries and served on the library committees at most of the universities at which he taught and {{was a member of the}} Board of Curators of the Bodleian Library in Oxford. He was instrumental in founding the Medical Library Association in North America and served as its second president from 1901–1904. In Britain he was the first (and only) president of the Medical Library Association of Great Britain and Ireland and also a president of the Bibliographical Society of London (1913).|$|E
2500|$|Clark {{wrote and}} lectured during the decade. The <b>annotated</b> <b>catalogue</b> {{of the royal}} {{collection}} of Leonardo da Vinci's drawings, on which he had begun work in 1929, was published in 1935, to highly favourable reviews; eighty years later Oxford Art Online called it [...] "a work of firm scholarship, the conclusions of which have {{stood the test of}} time". Another 1935 publication by Clark offended some in the avant-garde: an essay, published in The Listener, [...] "The Future of Painting", in which he rebuked surrealists {{on the one hand and}} abstract artists on the other for claiming to represent the future of art. He judged both as too elitist and too specialised – [...] "the end of a period of self-consciousness, inbreeding and exhaustion". He maintained that good art must be accessible to everyone and must be rooted in the observable world. During the 1930s Clark was in demand as a lecturer, and he frequently used his research for his talks as the basis of his books. In 1936 he gave the Ryerson Lectures at Yale University; from these came his study of Leonardo, published three years later; it too, attracted much praise, at the time and subsequently.|$|E
