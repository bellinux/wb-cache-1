50|$|Although a crude road made of {{dirt and}} wooden boards was {{constructed}} to run from this area to Tallahassee, a railroad was sorely needed. (In the early 1850s an upgraded plank road was constructed). By 1835 a rail connection was launched from Tallahassee {{to the town of}} St. Marks situated a little farther south on the St. Marks river. The rail effectively by-passed Magnolia. Although the rail line was very crude and initially relied on mules to pull open cars along loosely <b>anchored</b> <b>rails,</b> this connection gave St. Marks a transportation advantage over Magnolia.|$|R

50|$|The Tampa Bay Hotel {{was built}} by {{railroad}} magnate Henry B. Plant between 1888 and 1891. The construction cost over 3 million dollars. It was considered the premier hotel of the eight that Mr. Plant built to <b>anchor</b> his <b>rail</b> line. The hotel itself covers 6 acre and is a quarter-mile long. It was equipped with the first elevator ever installed in Florida. The elevator is still working today, {{making it one of}} the oldest continually operational elevators in the nation. The 511 rooms and suites were the first in Florida to have electric lights and telephones. Most rooms also included private bathrooms, complete with a full-size tub. The price for a room ranged from $5.00 to $15.00 a night at a time when the average hotel in Tampa charged $1.25 to $2.00. The poured-concrete, steel-reinforced structure of the building was advertised as fireproof.|$|R
25|$|Track {{consists}} of two parallel steel <b>rails,</b> <b>anchored</b> perpendicular to members called ties (sleepers) of timber, concrete, steel, or plastic to maintain a consistent distance apart, or rail gauge. Rail gauges are usually categorized as standard gauge (used on approximately 54.8% of the world's existing railway lines), broad gauge, and narrow gauge. In addition to the rail gauge, the tracks will be laid to conform with a Loading gauge which defines the maximum height and width for railway vehicles and their loads to ensure safe passage through bridges, tunnels and other structures.|$|R
25|$|Fang bolts or <b>rail</b> <b>anchor</b> bolts {{have also}} been used for fixing rails or chairs to sleepers. The fang bolt is a bolt {{inserted}} {{through a hole in}} the sleeper with a fanged nut that bites into the lower surface of the sleeper. For fastening flat-bottomed rails, an upper-lipped washer can be used to grip the edge of the rail. They are more resistant to loosening by vibrations and movement of the rail. They are thought more effective than spikes and screws and so are used in positions such as switch (point) tieplates and on sharp curves.|$|R

40|$|Railroad {{engineering}} {{practices and}} Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations require track to be inspected for physical defects at specified intervals, {{which may be}} as often as thrice per week. These inspections are conducted visually by railroad track inspectors, but due to practical considerations, only {{a certain level of}} detail and consistency can be obtained. Enhancements are possible using machine-vision technology, which consists of recording digital images of track elements and analyzing those images using custom algorithms to identify defects or their symptoms. Based on analysis of FRA accident data, discussion with railroad track engineering experts, consultation with Association of American Railroads researchers, and review of existing inspection technologies and methods, this project focuses on developing a machine-vision-based system to detect irregularities and defects in wood-tie fasteners, <b>rail</b> <b>anchors,</b> crib ballast, and turnout components. A Video Track Cart was developed for initial video data acquisition, and algorithms were developed to consistently detect the rail, tie plates, ties, cut spikes, <b>rail</b> <b>anchors,</b> and ballast using a global-to-local algorithmic approach. Using the detection algorithms on panoramas generated from the videos further increases their accuracy, with added benefit in using the panoramas to manually confirm the severity of defects if results are in doubt. Once defects have been detected and catalogued by the system, a quantitative comparison of data from different runs is possible, opening up possibilities for defect growth trending and predictive maintenance scheduling. Ultimately, this system will provide consistent, quantitative track inspection data for not only increasing current inspection capabilities, but also deepening the understanding of track health over time...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{authors have}} {{developed}} a plastic design method for sheathed timber frame shear walls. It has been presented and discussed for inclusion in Eurocode 5 and a Swedish handbook has been presented. In the plastic method, {{you can choose to}} transfer the anchoring force via the leading stud to the substrate, corresponding to a fully anchored shear wall (no uplift of studs), but you can also choose to utilize the sheathings to transfer the tensile force via the sheathing-to-framing joints to the substrate by <b>anchoring</b> the bottom <b>rail,</b> corresponding to a partially anchored shear wall (studs experience uplift). By the plastic method several alternatives for anchoring the wall are possible and they can also be combined {{in such a way that}} each of them take a portion of the uplifting force, e. g. through a simple tying down device, through the sheathing-to-framing joints and through anchoring of the shear wall to the transverse wall. The method also makes it possible to include the load-bearing capacity of wall segments including openings. The handbook treats primarily shear walls, but for the sake of completeness some aspects of the roof and floor diaphragms are also discussed. The interior force distribution in sheathed timber frame walls weak in shear is discussed, as are the fundamental difference between the effect of vertical loads on the stabilisation of walls which are rigid or weak in shear, and how the plastic design method is applied to multi-storey timber buildings...|$|R
40|$|North American {{railroads and}} the United States Department of Transportation (US DOT) Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) require {{periodic}} inspection of railway infrastructure to ensure safe railway operation. The {{primary focus of}} this research is the inspection of North American Class I railroad mainline and sidings, as these generally experience the highest traffic densities. Tracks that are subjected to heavy-haul traffic necessitate frequent inspection and have more intensive maintenance requirements, leaving railroads with less time to accomplish these inspections. To improve the current (primarily manual) inspection process in an efficient and cost effective manner, machine vision technology can be developed and used as a robust alternative. The machine vision system consists of a video acquisition system for recording digital images, a mobile rail platform for allowing video capture in the field, and custom designed algorithms to identify defects and symptomatic conditions from these images. Results of previously developed inspection algorithms have shown good reliability in identifying cut spikes and <b>rail</b> <b>anchors</b> from field-acquired videos. The focus of this paper is the development of machine vision algorithms designed to recognize turnout components and inspect them for defects. In order to prioritize which turnout components are the most critical for the safe operation of trains, a risk-based analysis of the FRA accident database has been performed. From these prioritized turnout components, those that are best suited for vision-based inspection are being further investigated. Future analysis of the machine vision system results, in conjunction with a comparison of historical data, will enhance the ability for longer-term proactive assessment of the health of the track system and its components...|$|R
40|$|The catastrophic {{derailment}} of a {{gantry crane}} is analysed in the paper. Under {{the action of}} a persistent and very strong wind, with gusts at about 110 km/h, the crane started moving and, after having travelled for about 60 m, derailed and collapsed. Fortunately, no injured operator resulted from the event. The crane was endowed with passive rail clamps, {{which had to be}} dimensioned with reference to a very strong, i. e. out-of-service, wind intensity, given in standards. The analysis of technical data of the crane and of the installed clamps brought to the conclusion that a trivial error was made in the determination of the out-of-service wind load, since no aerodynamic coefficient was taken into account in the evaluation of the wind thrust. Due to this, the clamps didn't respond to the current regulations and, actually, were not capable of keeping the crane standing for the strongest wind load, which may occur in the region of the plant installation. The analysis, based on crane geometry and wind recordings, shows that, actually, the clamps capacity was exceeded by the wind load at the moment of the accident. A plane analysis of the crane loading condition, based on a beam model, allowed to explain the way the crane collapsed, with the rotation about a vertical axis of one of the leg, and to estimate the loads exchanged between the crane bogies and the rail, that caused the rupture of several <b>rail</b> <b>anchoring</b> bolts. The accident was caused by a design error and this points out the necessity of accurate evaluations, with multiple and independent checks, in particular in case of large plants with significant risk for operators, as in this case, or for the environment...|$|R
5000|$|When a {{thermite}} {{process is}} used for track circuits - the bonding of wires to the rails with a copper alloy, a graphite mould is used. The graphite mould is reusable many times, because the copper alloy is not as hot as the steel alloys used in rail welding. In signal bonding, the volume of molten copper is quite small, approximately [...] and the mould is lightly clamped {{to the side of}} the rail, also holding a signal wire in place. In rail welding, the weld charge can weigh up to 13 kg. The hardened sand mould is heavy and bulky, must be securely clamped in a very specific position and then subjected to intense heat for several minutes before firing the charge.When rail is welded into long strings, the longitudinal expansion and contraction of steel must be taken into account. British practice sometimes uses a sliding joint of some sort at the end of long runs of continuously welded rail, to allow some movement, although by using a heavy concrete sleeper and an extra amount of ballast at the sleeper ends, the track, which will be prestressed according to the ambient temperature at the time of its installation, will develop compressive stress in hot ambient temperature, or tensile stress in cold ambient temperature, its strong attachment to the heavy sleepers preventing buckling or other deformation. Current practice is to use welded rails throughout on high speed lines, and expansion joints are kept to a minimum, often only to protect junctions and crossings from excessive stress. American practice appears to be very similar, a straightforward physical restraint of the rail. The rail is prestressed, or considered [...] "stress neutral" [...] at some particular ambient temperature. This [...] "neutral" [...] temperature will vary according to local climate conditions, taking into account lowest winter and warmest summer temperatures. The rail is physically secured to the ties or sleepers with <b>rail</b> <b>anchors,</b> or anti-creepers. If the track ballast is good and clean and the ties are in good condition, and the track geometry is good, then the welded rail will withstand ambient temperature swings normal to the region.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{retrospective}} research paper on measures taken to prevent over-the-embankment (OTB) motor vehicle crashes in the Hoopa Area of Northern California. OTB crashes {{are defined as}} any motor vehicle crash that results in that vehicle leaving the roadway and continuing down an embankment. The roadways included {{for the purposes of}} this study will be limited to those state highways, local roads, and major spur roads within the approximately 50 mile radius which constitutes the Hoopa Health Association emergency medical services response zone. This study demonstrates that the bluff areas are over-represented for fatal and critical injuries from all motor vehicle crashes in the Hoopa Area. It will further show that the nature of these fatalities is primarily major systems trauma. It is meant to reinforce the conclusion that improved rescue operations and response is not the answer for multiple trauma patients, since even under optimal conditions the time needed for response time, rescue time and the time involved in transport to the nearest contract care emergency unit (52 miles) is far too much time to respond to severe systems trauma. The methodology used in this study was reasonably simple, inexpensive and low-tech surveillance used to predict OTB crash clustering. It was implemented by an Emergency Medical Service Coordinator who had also served as a rescuer. The focal points of the surveillance efforts were the bluff areas that presented a major problem for rescuers because of their height and extreme steepness. The author began a program of video taping the areas where the most severe problems were occurring. He would accompany ambulance units, and record road features, embankments, shoulder widths, and slide marks soon after the accidents had occurred. He began the video taping in 1985. In 1985, coincidental to the video taping campaign, Cal-Trans found itself at fault in two substantial lawsuits in the Hoopa Area. The one was for inadequate road width, and the second was for actions taken by a state road crew at the scene of a diesel spill that caused a double fatality in the North Hoopa Bluffs. At approximately the same time, a Cal-Trans employee developed a means for <b>anchoring</b> guard <b>rails</b> underneath the roadway, using cantilevered steel I-Beams set into ditches under the roadbed. This and the lawsuits and the video campaign resulted in a massive campaign to install guardrail on the bluffs and in widening the roads and other roadbed improvements. Based on the ongoing surveillance of data, since the installation of the guardrail, there is a very strong correlation between the date of installation and a downturn in the number of OTB crashes. The existence of the guardrail has not increased or been a factor in head oncrashes. The cantilevered guardrail seem to be holding up well to "brushing" impacts and falling rocks along the bluffs without any obvious signs of weakening. There are still embankments that are unprotected. There are some dangerous turns where guardrail weren't installed completely. These areas will continue to be especially hazardous until they are improved. Lack of visibility of a problem often prevents that problem from being addressed or allows it to be set aside. In OTB crashes multiple systems trauma is most often the killer. Seat belts are a good preventive measure to avoid ejection from the vehicle once the accident is in progress. Other factors in the occurrence of OTB crashes are age of driver, speed and road condition, sex of the driver, familiarity with the road. and sensory impairment from drugs, alcohol, and lack of sleep. The author determined that prevention would reduce fatalities far more than efforts to treat trauma after the fact. He also suggests exploration for altering the environment in an effort to prevent accidental injury rather than or in addition to education efforts...|$|R
