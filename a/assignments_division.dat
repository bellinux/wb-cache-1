40|$|Most demand <b>assignment</b> time <b>division</b> {{multiple}} access (TDMA) satellite access protocols use centralizedcontrol access schemes, rather than distributed ones, because their simplicity and robustness usually compensates for the longer allocation delay. Starting from the fifo ordered demand assignment/information bit energy adapter (FODA/IBEA) centralized-control protocol, we studied two distributed-control protocols, named distributed allocation with request in fixed slots (DRIFS) and faded environments effective distributed engineering redundant signalling (FEEDERS) respectively, for accessing a geostationary satellite channel. Multimedia traffic and faded environments were {{considered in the}} study of both access schemes.

40|$|Abstrucr- We study {{wavelength}} {{assignment for}} lightpaths over WDM Mgs {{to minimize the}} SONET ADMs used. This problem has attracted much attention recently. However, its computation complexity remains unknown, and the only known heuristic which does not allow the splitting of lightpaths is problematic in both the algorithm itself and its performance analysis. We Brst prove the NP-completeness of this problem, followed by a nontrivial randomized-approximation scheme. We then present a tighter lower bound on the minimum number of ADMs required. After that, we show the incorrectness of the known heuristic and then modify it to make it correct. We also propose three additional heuristics. Their performances are compared through extensive simulation studies.
