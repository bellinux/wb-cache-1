Very few people were in that car, and on one end of it there was no one, except on the opposite seat, where sat a man about fifty years old, with a most winning face and an elegant eye--a beautiful eye; and I took him from his dress to be a master mechanic, a man who had a vocation. He had with him a very fine little child of about four or five years. I was watching the affection which existed between those two. I judged he was the grandfather, perhaps. It was really a pretty child, and I was admiring her, {{and as soon as he}} saw I was admiring her he began to notice me.|$|E

60|$|A {{few words}} on the latest attempt which {{has been made to}} naturalize an exotic bird in England will not seem out of place here. <b>About</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> a gentleman in Essex {{introduced}} the rufous tinamou--a handsome game bird, nearly as large as a fowl--into his estate. Up till the present time, or till quite recently these birds have bred every year, and at one time they had increased considerably and scattered about the neighbourhood. When it began to increase, the neighbouring proprietors and sportsmen generally were asked not to shoot it, but to give it a chance, and {{there is reason to believe}} that they have helped to protect it, and have taken a great interest in the experiment. Whatever the ultimate result may be, the partial success attained during these few years is decidedly encouraging, and that for more reasons than one. In the first place, the bird was badly chosen for such an experiment. It belongs to the pampas of La Plata, to which it is restricted, and where it enjoys a dry, bright climate, and lives concealed in the tall close-growing indigenous grasses. The conditions of its habitat are therefore widely different from those of Essex, or of any part of England; and, besides, it has a peculiar organisation, for it happens to be one of those animals of ancient types of which a few species still survive in South America. That so unpromising a subject as this large archaic tinamou should be able to maintain its existence in this country, even for a very few years, encourages one to believe that with better-chosen species, more highly organized, and with more pliant habits, such as the hazel hen of Europe for a game bird, success would be almost certain.|$|E
6000|$|... "We-ell, {{it was no}} end of a pitman's strike <b>about</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> There were twenty-five {{thousand}} men involved--Militia, of course. At {{the end of the}} first month--October--when things were looking rather blue, one of those clever Labour leaders got hold of the Militia Act and discovered that any Militia regiment could, by a two-thirds vote, go on 'heef' in a Military Area in addition to its usual biennial camp. Two-and-twenty battalions of Geordies solemnly applied, and they were turned loose into the Irish and Scotch Areas under an I.G. Brigadier who had private instructions to knock clinkers out of 'em. But the pitman is a strong and agile bird. He throve on snowdrifts and entrenching and draggin' guns through heather. He was being fed and clothed for nothing, besides having a chance of making head-money, and his strike-pay was going clear to his wife and family. You see? Wily man. But wachtabittje! When that 'heef' finished in December the strike was still on. Then that same Labour leader found out, from the same Act, that if at any time more than thirty or forty men of a Militia regiment wished to volunteer to do sea-time and study big guns in the Fleet they were in no wise to be discouraged, but were to be taken on as opportunity offered and paid a bob a day. Accordingly, about January, Geordie began volunteering for sea- time--seven and eight hundred men out of each regiment. Anyhow, it made up seventeen thousand men! It was a splendid chance and the Armity jumped at it. The Home and Channel Fleets and the North Sea and Cruiser Squadrons were strengthened with lame ducks from the Fleet Reserve, and between 'em with a little stretching and pushing they accommodated all of that young division." ...|$|E

When he came in I asked his pardon for being so impatient, but told him I could not be easy till he had told me what the meaning of all this was. [...] "Why, madam," [...] says the Dutch merchant, [...] "in short, the meaning is what I am surprised at too.

Movements obviously require concerted actions from both systems. Research in rats has demonstrated the interdependencies between postural control {{and the development of}} fluent walking. Only 15 days after birth, adult-like fluent locomotion emerges and is critically dependent upon postural development. Vesttibular deprivation induces a retardation in postural development and, consequently, a retarded development of adult-like locomotion. The cerebellum obviously has an important role in mutual adjustments in postural control and extremity movements, or, in coupling the phyiogenetic older and newer structures. In the human, the cerebellum develops partly after birth and therefore is vulnerable to adverse perinatal influences. Such vulnerability seems t...|$|R

50|$|The {{elevation}} of the Tibetan Plateau during the Tertiary period was {{an important factor in}} the genesis of the south-west monsoon, which is the dominant climatic control influencing the hydrology of the Mekong Basin. Understanding the nature and timing of the {{elevation of}} Tibet (and the Central Highlands of Vietnam) therefore helps explain the provenance of sediment reaching the delta and the Tonle Sap Great Lake today. Studies of the provenance of sediments in the Mekong delta reveal a major switch in the source of sediments <b>about</b> <b>eight</b> million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> (Ma). From 36 to 8 Ma the bulk (76 percent) of the sediments deposited in the delta came from erosion of the bedrock in the Three Rivers Area. From 8 Ma to the present, however, the contribution from the Three Rivers Area fell to 40 percent, while that from the Central Highlands rose from 11 to 51 percent. One of the most striking conclusions of provenance studies is the small contribution of sediment from the other parts of the Mekong basin, notably the Khorat Plateau, the uplands of northern Laos and northern Thailand, and the mountain ranges south of the Three Rivers area.|$|R

5000|$|Naming of Dhamrai:There are two {{versions}} of how the name of Dhamrai came about:-(1) During the time of Asoka the Great there was a Buddhist [...] "Dharmarajika" [...] and the name became truncated and in time {{came to be known}} as Dhamrai. The discovery of a prehistoric Buddhist [...] "stupa" [...] in Savar, about 10 miles away from Dhamrai lends credence to this opinion.(2) A famous Sufi saint, Hazrat Shahjalal, came to what is now Bangladesh, <b>about</b> <b>eight</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> with 360 companions. Legend has it that five of them (Tirmizi Al-Hussaini, Hazrat Hazi, Hazrat Gazi, Hazrat Zambahadur and Hazrat Shah Magdum) came to Dhamrai area which was then sparsely populated and heavily forested. They settled and started leading a secluded life. Food supplies ultimately ran short and one day they found a stray cow wandering about. They slaughtered the cattle and used the meat to satisfy their hunger. After a few days a couple by the name of Dhama Gope and his wife Rai Goalini came and claimed that the cow was theirs. They demanded compensation for the cow. The Sufis learnt that the couple was childless. It is said that with their blessings a child was born to the couple and also they said that they would name the place so that their names would forever be remembered. Thus the name Dhamrai (Dham+Rai) came about.|$|R

She is Jim Robinson's (Alan Dale) [...] "spoiled little girl" [...] and behaves [...] "terrible" [...] towards her father's girlfriend Zoe Davis (Ally Fowler) taping [...] "ugly threats" [...] from television shows and playing them over the phone to scare Zoe.

In her teenage years she was described as giving her father plenty of reasons to worry, going from dead-end job to the next and being incredibly flirtatious. During the character's return in 2005, whilst an interviewed by Digital Spy, Bell spoke about how Lucy has grown up and learned from her mistake, changing from a rebellious young woman into a clever business woman and stated: [...] "I started in 1990 and I've come back many times, the last <b>about</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Now I'd describe Lucy as a centered woman with her life together, very focused on her business.

A balloon from Kanadaw spoke us to-day {{and threw}} on board several late papers; they contain some {{exceedingly}} curious information relative to Kanawdian or rather Amriccan antiquities. You know, I presume, that laborers have for some months been employed in preparing the ground for a new fountain at Paradise, the Emperor's principal pleasure garden. Paradise, it appears, has been, literally speaking, an island time out of mind--that is to say, its northern boundary was always (as far back as any record extends) a rivulet, or rather a very narrow arm of the sea. This arm was gradually widened until it attained its present breadth--a mile. The whole length of the island is nine miles; the breadth varies materially. The entire area (so Pundit says) was, <b>about</b> <b>eight</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> densely packed with houses, some of them twenty stories high; land (for some most unaccountable reason) being considered as especially precious just in this vicinity. The disastrous earthquake, however, of the year 2050, so totally uprooted and overwhelmed the town (for it was almost too large {{to be called a}} village) that the most indefatigable of our antiquarians have never yet been able to obtain from the site any sufficient data (in the shape of coins, medals or inscriptions) wherewith to build up even the ghost of a theory concerning the manners, customs, &c., &c., &c., of the aboriginal inhabitants. Nearly all that we have hitherto known of them is, that they were a portion of the Knickerbocker tribe of savages infesting the continent at its first discovery by Recorder Riker, a knight of the Golden Fleece. They were by no means uncivilized, however, but cultivated various arts and even sciences after a fashion of their own. It is related of them that they were acute in many respects, but were oddly afflicted with monomania for building what, in the ancient Amriccan, was denominated [...] "churches"--a kind of pagoda instituted for the worship of two idols that went by the names of Wealth and Fashion. In the end, it is said, the island became, nine tenths of it, church. The women, too, it appears, were oddly deformed by a natural protuberance of the region just below the small of the back--although, most unaccountably, this deformity was looked upon altogether in the light of a beauty. One or two pictures of these singular women have in fact, been miraculously preserved. They look very odd, very--like something between a turkey-cock and a dromedary.|$|R
