50|$|Bhuman is not {{the human}} soul, the {{companion}} of Prana; Bhuman is Ananda (Bliss), immense joy. Samprasada also refers to the released soul. The consideration of happiness induces and impels man to perform actions, had he experienced unhappiness in his pursuit {{he would not have}} gone in for the actions at all; but real happiness is that which one enjoys in the vision of the Infinite. The Doctrine of Ananda (Bliss) is central to the philosophy of Vedanta. Ananda conveys a sense of infinite, eternal, absolute happiness and not selfish pleasure which is transitory gratification but a state of <b>absolute</b> <b>expansion</b> called Bhuman. Bhuman is illimitation. Ananda, the supreme pleasure, is in illimitation and not in the limited (alpa).|$|E
50|$|When {{measuring}} {{the expansion of}} a liquid, the measurement must account {{for the expansion of}} the container as well. For example, a flask that has been constructed with a long narrow stem filled with enough liquid that the stem itself is partially filled, when placed in a heat bath will initially show the column of liquid in the stem to drop followed by the immediate increase of that column until the flask-liquid-heat bath system has thermalized. The initial observation of the column of liquid dropping is not due to an initial contraction of the liquid but rather the expansion of the flask as it contacts the heat bath first. Soon after, the liquid in the flask is heated by the flask itself and begins to expand. Since liquids typically have a greater expansion over solids, the liquid in the flask eventually exceeds that of the flask, causing the column of liquid in the flask to rise. A direct measurement of the height of the liquid column is a measurement of the apparent expansion of the liquid. The <b>absolute</b> <b>expansion</b> of the liquid is the apparent expansion corrected for the expansion of the containing vessel.|$|E

An increase in the endowment of a factor of production can lead to an absolute curtailment {{in the production of}} the commodity using that factor intensively, and an <b>absolute</b> <b>expansion</b> of the commodity using relatively little of the same factor. This outcome – which we call “Reverse Rybczynski ” – implies immiserizing factor growth. We present a simple analytical example that delivers this result with unique pre- and post-growth equilibria. In this example, production occurs within the cone of diversification, such that factor price equalization holds.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the elimination of certain chronic diseases is capable of leading to the compression of morbidity among elderly individuals. METHODS: A population-based, cross-sectional study was carried out with official data {{for the city of}} Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil in 2000 and data from the SABE (Health, Wellbeing and Ageing) study. Sullivan's method was used to calculate disability-free life expectancy. Cause-deleted life tables were used to calculate the probabilities of death and disabilities with the elimination of health conditions. RESULTS: The largest gains in disability-free life expectancy, with the elimination of chronic illness, occurred in the female gender. Among individuals of a more advanced age, gains in disability-free life expectancy occurred as result of a relative compression of morbidity. Among men aged 75 years, all conditions studied, except heart disease and systemic arterial pressure, led to an <b>absolute</b> <b>expansion</b> of morbidity and, at the same time, to a relative compression of morbidity upon being eliminated. CONCLUSIONS: The elimination of chronic diseases in the elderly could lead to the compression of morbidity in elderly men and women...|$|E
40|$|Leaf {{development}} {{is affected by}} both internal (genetic) and external (environmental) regulatory factors. The aim of this work was to investigate how leaf growth variables are related {{to one another in}} a range of environments. The leaf growth variables of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and leaf development mutants (ang 4, ron 2 - 1, elo 1, elo 2 and elo 4) were studied under different incident light treatments (light and shade). The leaves studied were altered in various leaf development variables, such as the duration of expansion, relative and <b>absolute</b> <b>expansion</b> rates, epidermal cell size, epidermal cell number and initiation rate. Final leaf area was correlated to maximal absolute leaf expansion rate and cell number, but not to duration of leaf expansion or cell size. These relationships were common to all studied genotypes and light conditions, suggesting that leaf size is determined early in development. In addition, the early variables involved in leaf development were correlated to one another, and initial relative expansion rate was negatively correlated to the duration of expansion. These relationships between the leaf development variables were used to construct a conceptual model of leaf size control...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Haematoma {{expansion}} following intracerebral haemorrhage {{is a major}} {{determinant of}} early neurological worsening and poor clinical outcome. This has created interest in improving patient selection for therapies targeting haematoma expansion. Based on prior observations, we hypothesised that intracerebral haemorrhage volumes under 10 ml {{would be less likely to}} expand. We additionally sought to define a baseline haematoma volume below which significant growth was not observed. Methods: Patient data were obtained from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive. Patients with intracerebral haemorrhage presented within six-hours of symptom onset had baseline clinical, radiological and laboratory data, and computed tomographic scan at 72 h and three-month follow-up. The predictor of interest was baseline haematoma volume. Primary outcomes were absolute and relative haematoma growth. Secondary outcomes were early neurological worsening, good functional outcome, and 90 -day mortality. Results: The final dataset consisted of 496 patients. Baseline haematoma volumes under 10 ml were associated with much lower odds of <b>absolute</b> <b>expansion</b> compared to larger haematomas. Smaller haematomas were associated with significantly decreased odds of early neurological worsening and three-month mortality, and increased odds of good functional outcome.

40|$|Recent {{research}} almost unambiguously refutes {{the hypothesis}} that the timing of interceptive actions is solely based on the relative rate of expansion [i. e. τ(φ) ]. The aim of the present experiment was to evaluated the merits of eight alternative informational variables that recently have been proposed in the literature (i. e. φ̇, θ̇, Δ̇, τ(φ), τ(θ), τ(Δ), τ(φ, θ), ζ). Participants (n= 7) were required to regulate the spatio-temporal characteristics of their reach and grasp to catch a ball approaching on a constant spatial trajectory. To identify the information used to regulate the timing of the catch we examined the qualitative effects of ball speed (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, and 2. 5 m/s) and viewing (monocular versus binocular) on the kinematics of the catch. Subsequently, we directly assessed the quantitative relationship between informational variables and the timing of reach onset and hand closure. The findings raised serious doubts against the use of variables that specified the time-to-contact between the ball and the point of observation (i. e. relative rate of expansion and disparity). Further, optical variables solely confined to the trajectory of the ball (i. e. the <b>absolute</b> rate of <b>expansion)</b> did yield positive results for the timing of reach onset but not for the timing of hand closure. Only variables that were related to the closure of the gap between hand and ball were found to contribute to the timing of hand closure. These results suggest that information related to the constriction of the optical gap between end-effector and ball becomes more important with approach, whereas the contribution of the <b>absolute</b> rate of <b>expansion</b> becomes less leading. © Springer-Verlag 2004...|$|R

A newly defined urbanization level index (UI), based on urban land area, is proposed to describe Chinese urban expansion process at 1 kilometer, provincial, regional, and national scales, together with the <b>absolute</b> urban <b>expansion</b> index (UE(a)) and the relative urbanization expansion index (UE(r)). The {{results indicate that the}} percentages of total land area occupied by urban in the late 1980 s, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2008 were approximately 0. 25 %, 0. 32 %, 0. 33 %, 0. 43 % and 0. 52 % of China's total land area, respectively. Between the late 1980 s and 2008, the total urban expansion in the mainland of China was 2. 645 x 10 (4) km(2), resulting in an annual urban expansion area of about 1322. 7 km(2) /yr, with the UE(r) of 111. 9 %. This study also finds that there has been an obvious spatial gradient of urbanization ratio running from the east coast to the west inland, and the urbanization gaps among different regions have persisted over the past two decades. The study also reveals obvious temporal variations of the urbanization rates. There was very little urban growth during the period of 1995 - 2000 due to the governmental policy factors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInterleukin 17 A (IL- 17) -producing CD 4 + T helper type 17 (Th 17) {{cells have}} {{recently}} drawn attention as possible effector cells of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in murine models. Their role after allogeneic HCT in humans is unknown. In this prospective study, Th 17, Th 1 / 17, and Th 1 cells were quantified in the peripheral blood of 80 patients {{within the first}} 3  months after allogeneic HCT using intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. Within the observation period, Th 1, Th 1 / 17, and Th 17 cells did not reconstitute to levels of healthy control subjects. In contrast to Th 1 cells, no further expansion of Th 1 / 17 and Th 17 cells was observed during the first month after HCT. Antithymocyte globulin during conditioning significantly reduced the frequency of Th 1 / 17 and Th 17 cells but not of Th 1 cells. Acute GVHD {{was not associated with}} significant changes {{in the size of the}} Th 1, Th 1 / 17, or Th 17 cell subsets. Cytomegalovirus reactivation triggered the expansion of all T helper subsets, and Th 1 cells showed the strongest increase. In contrast, no significant changes were found in the T helper cell compartment of patients with bacterial infections compared with time-matched control subjects. In conclusion, quantitative reconstitution of Th 1, Th 1 / 17, and Th 17 cells is impaired within the first 3 months after HCT, especially when antithymocyte globulin is administered during conditioning. Cytomegalovirus reactivation, but not acute GVHD or bacterial infection, triggered the <b>absolute</b> <b>expansion</b> of these T cell subsets...|$|E

The conditioner {{was applied to the}} soil as dry grains ranging from 0. 2 to 1 mm in size and at five concentrations (C) ranging from 0 to 1 % (d. wt.). Laboratory measurements showed an exponential decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity and an increase of available water capacity with an increase of C. Relative expansion (Lr) at saturation increased from 0 to 0. 5 with an increase of C from 0 to 1 %. Water diffusivity (D) substantially decreased with an increase of C. At a water content () equal to 30 % (Vol.). D was reduced by 54 % for C = 0. 25 %, 90 % for C = 0. 50 %, and 100 % for C = 1 %. There were two distinct stages of water movement under ponded infiltration. The first stage, where most of the expansion occurred, was characterized by increased wetting front (L) cumulative infiltration (D) with an increase of C. The second stage exhibited a reverse effect, i. e., L and D decreased with an increase of C. Under a sprinkler infiltration. D was not affected by C, but L was decreased by increasing C. Although, the values of the <b>absolute</b> <b>expansion</b> under ponding were higher than those under sprinkler with the corresponding C, the Lr values were higher under sprinkler due to the reduced advance rate of wetting front.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that gp 130 and c-kit signalling synergize for the ex vivo expansion of human cord blood (CB) CD 34 + haematopoietic progenitor cells. We were interested in evaluating this synergy within an ontogenetically different haematopoietic tissue [i. e. adult bone marrow (BM) ] and on a more primitive progenitor subset (i. e. CD 34 + CD 38 -cells), which are highly enriched for pre-colony forming unit (CFU) cells. These cells were plated out in a primary liquid culture supplemented with either interleukin (IL) - 6 +stem cell factor (SCF), IL- 6 + SCF+soluble IL- 6 receptor (sIL- 6 R), IL- 6 +SCF+sIL- 6 R+IL 3 +IL- 1 or SCF+IL- 3 +IL- 6 +IL- 1. Cell counting after liquid culture revealed an <b>absolute</b> <b>expansion</b> of 2. 2 -, 4. 1 -, 89. 5 - and 65. 7 -fold compared with initial cell input for the four-cytokine combinations, respectively. The secondary read-out assay revealed that this cell expansion in the liquid culture also resulted in CFU generation, with absolute cloning efficiencies of 0. 002, 0. 024, 12. 13 and 7. 73 (per cell initially present) for the respective cytokine combinations. These results indicate that gp 130 and c-kit signalling alone (i. e. using IL 6 +SCF+sIL- 6 R), {{in terms of both}} cell number and CFU generation, insufficiently stimulate primitive adult BM CD 34 +CD 38 - haematopoietic cells in order to reach a CFU generation comparable with that obtained after multifactor stimulation. Adding sIL- 6 R to the multifactor stimulation and compared with this multifactor stimulation, a 1. 7 -fold synergy in terms of cell expansion and a 3. 0 -fold synergy in terms of CFU generation are obtained. The sIL- 6 R/IL- 6 complex thus has a narrower spectrum of action on primitive adult BM CD 34 +CD 38 - cells than on CB CD 34 + cells...|$|E
30|$|Several studies provide {{evidence}} that productivity dynamics can explain changes in the coefficients. By decomposing output, Gordon (2010) finds that changes {{in the relationship between}} output, hours and productivity contributed to jobless recoveries after 2000. Daly and Hobijn (2010) find that the main factor driving the unusual rise in the United States unemployment relative to output during the financial crisis was very rapid productivity growth which allowed businesses to cut back sharply on labor while maintaining output levels. Similarly, by decomposing Okun’s coefficient, Daly et al. (2013) {{provide evidence}} that productivity is more procyclical in recessions than in normal times, reflecting greater variation in factor utilization around these times. The procyclicality of Okun’s coefficient vis-à-vis the business cycle has been confirmed by Owyang and Sekhposyan (2012) who also find that periods of high unemployment are found to be correlated with increased sensitivity of the unemployment rate to output growth or gap fluctuations. Finally, Knotek (2007) finds the Okun’s coefficient for the United States to be smaller (in <b>absolute</b> value) during <b>expansions</b> than recessions.|$|R

We aimed to provide updated HALE and DALYs for geographies worldwide and evaluate how disease burden changes with development. Findings Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2015, with decreases in communicable, neonatal, maternal, and nutritional (Group 1) disease DALYs offset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Much of this epidemiological transition was caused by changes in population growth and ageing, but it was accelerated by widespread improvements in SDI that also correlated strongly with the increasing importance of NCDs. Both total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most Group 1 causes significantly decreased by 2015, and although total burden climbed {{for the majority of}} NCDs, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined. Nonetheless, age-standardised DALY rates due to several high-burden NCDs (including osteoarthritis, drug use disorders, depression, diabetes, congenital birth defects, and skin, oral, and sense organ diseases) either increased or remained unchanged, leading to increases in their relative ranking in many geographies. From 2005 to 2015, HALE at birth increased by an average of 2 · 9 years (95 % uncertainty interval 2 · 9 – 3 · 0) for men and 3 · 5 years (3 · 4 – 3 · 7) for women, while HALE at age 65 years improved by 0 · 85 years (0 · 78 – 0 · 92) and 1 · 2 years (1 · 1 – 1 · 3), respectively. Rising SDI was associated with consistently higher HALE and a somewhat smaller proportion of life spent with functional health loss; however, rising SDI was related to increases in total disability. Many countries and territories in central America and eastern sub-Saharan Africa had increasingly lower rates of disease burden than expected given their SDI. At the same time, a subset of geographies recorded a growing gap between observed and expected levels of DALYs, a trend driven mainly by rising burden due to war, interpersonal violence, and various NCDs. Interpretation Health is improving globally, but this means more populations are spending more time with functional health loss, an <b>absolute</b> <b>expansion</b> of morbidity. The proportion of life spent in ill health decreases somewhat with increasing SDI, a relative compression of morbidity, which supports continued efforts to elevate personal income, improve education, and limit fertility.

From 2005 to 2015, HALE at birth increased by an average of 2 · 9 years (95 % uncertainty interval 2 · 9 – 3 · 0) for men and 3 · 5 years (3 · 4 – 3 · 7) for women, while HALE at age 65 years improved by 0 · 85 years (0 · 78 – 0 · 92) and 1 · 2 years (1 · 1 – 1 · 3), respectively. Rising SDI was associated with consistently higher HALE and a somewhat smaller proportion of life spent with functional health loss; however, rising SDI was related to increases in total disability. Many countries and territories in central America and eastern sub-Saharan Africa had increasingly lower rates of disease burden than expected given their SDI. At the same time, a subset of geographies recorded a growing gap between observed and expected levels of DALYs, a trend driven mainly by rising burden due to war, interpersonal violence, and various NCDs. Interpretation Health is improving globally, but this means more populations are spending more time with functional health loss, an <b>absolute</b> <b>expansion</b> of morbidity. The proportion of life spent in ill health decreases somewhat with increasing SDI, a relative compression of morbidity, which supports continued efforts to elevate personal income, improve education, and limit fertility. Our analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework on which to benchmark geography-specific health performance and SDG progress. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform financial and research investments, prevention efforts, health policies, and health system improvement initiatives for all countries along the development continuum.

40|$|For {{any given}} spacetime {{the choice of}} time {{coordinate}} is undetermined. A particular choice is the absolute time associated with a preferred vector field. Using the absolute time Hamilton’s equations are − δHc δq = ˙π + Θπ, + δHc δπ = ˙q, where Θ = V a.;a is {{the expansion of the}} vector field. Thus there is a hitherto unnoticed term in the expansion of the preferred vector field. Hamilton’s equations can be used to describe fluid motion. In this case the absolute time is the time associated with the fluid’s comoving vector. As measured by this <b>absolute</b> time the <b>expansion</b> term is present. Similarly in cosmology, each observer has a co-moving vector and Hamilton’s equations again have an expansion term. It is necessary to include the expansion term to quantize systems such as the above by the canonical method of replacing Dirac brackets by commutators. Hamilton’s equations in this form do not have a corresponding sympletic form. Replacing the expansion by a particle number N ≡ exp(− ∫ Θdτ) and introducing the particle numbers conjugate momentum π N the standard sympletic form can be recovered with two extra fields N and π N. Briefly the possibility of a non-standard sympletic form and the further possibility of there being a non-zero Finsler curvature corresponding to this are looked at. 2...|$|R
40|$|Outer Cape Cod (Massachusetts) is {{dominated}} by active and stabilizing parabolic and transverse dunes interspersed with numerous inter-dune wetlands. Dune migration has been significantly affected by human activities; conversely, current dune movements are affecting local populations. The objective of the reported research was to assess, using remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) technologies, migration of the Cape Cod dunes {{and the effect of}} dune movement on distribution of associated wetlands. Aerial photographs from 1938 through 2003 were analyzed to track individual dune movements and subsequent wetland propagation and <b>expansion.</b> <b>Absolute</b> dune movement rates during this period were computed, with a plot of dune movement as a cumulative function. One sub-problem {{of this study was to}} quantify `white' areas of active moving sand and `dark' areas of vegetation, in order to quantify changes in vegetative cover with wetland propagation and, conversely, vegetative disappearance with dune movement. Attempts were made to correlate the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) with dune migration. Based on review of aerial photographs, parabolic dunes have migrated 150 to 250 m since 1938, with 60 % of the movement occurring between 1938 and 1977. The relation between absolute parabolic dune migration and corresponding PDSI is approximately logarithmic. Maximum dune migration is associated with PDSI values lower than - 2 and reflects moderate drought conditions. Wetlands consistently trailed the dunes, and the distance of wetland movement was related to dune movement distances. Wetland migration was particularly marked from the 1950 s to the 1980 s. Based on review of georeferenced aerial photographs, it is concluded that marked stabilization of Cape Cod dunes occurred in the 1980 s and 1990 s, with renewed movement in the 21 st Century. This study provides a practical application for assessment of dune migration and vegetative transformations over time using remote sensing and GIS technologies.

40|$|Abstract In hitting, {{performers}} {{are found}} {{to adapt to the}} approach speed of the ball, i. e. they tend to initiate their movement at a shorter time before contact for faster approaching balls. A change in movement time is always accompanied by a change in movement velocity when the movement trajectory is kept constant. Hence, a fast-approaching ball might induce high impact velocity that is in conflict with low impact constraints, such as propelling the ball towards a near goal. In this study we investigated the capacities of participants to perform one-dimensional hitting movements in the frontal plane to balls approach-ing on a head-on collision course. The temporal precision (i. e. ball approach speed: 1, 1. 5, and 2 m/s) and impact requirements (i. e. No-Goal, Near-Goal, and Far-Goal) were manipulated to examine the influence of task constraints on the temporal regulation of a stroke. The results showed that timing and speed were significantly affected by ball approach speed when the hit was not directed to a goal. In contrast, no speed-coupling and a constant time-to-impact strategy were found when impact velocity was constrained (i. e. aiming for a near goal). We were particularly interested in the nature and relation of information sources and timing patterns of movement initiation. Therefore, the relation between the time evolu-tion of three optical sources related to the approach of the ball and the observed patterns of swing onset were evaluated quantitatively. The analyses revealed that a viable explanation for the two observed qualitatively different onset patterns of the swing is a regulation based on the <b>absolute</b> rate of <b>expansion</b> or a co-varying variable. The flexible adaptation of timing to impact constraints may be realized by an adjustment of the critical region of this optical variable...|$|R

We aimed to provide updated HALE and DALYs for geographies worldwide and evaluate how disease burden changes with development.; We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost (YLLs) and years of life lived with disability (YLDs) for each geography, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using the Sullivan method, which draws from age-specific death rates and YLDs per capita. We then assessed how observed levels of DALYs and HALE differed from expected trends calculated with the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator constructed from measures of income per capita, average years of schooling, and total fertility rate.; Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2015, with decreases in communicable, neonatal, maternal, and nutritional (Group 1) disease DALYs offset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Much of this epidemiological transition was caused by changes in population growth and ageing, but it was accelerated by widespread improvements in SDI that also correlated strongly with the increasing importance of NCDs.

The effects of substantial and prolonged weight reduction on body water distribution are unknown, however. The authors studied total body water (TBW) by tritiated water dilution, ECW by 35 SO 4 dilution, exchangeable sodium (Na(e)) by 24 Na, and total body potassium (TBK) by 40 K whole-body counting in 25 severely obese women (body mass index [BMI] = 48 +/- 7 kg. m- 2, mean +/- standard deviation) aged 36 +/- 8 years before and at intervals after gastric restrictive (GR; n = 12) and malabsorptive (MA; n = 13) operations for obesity. Results are compared with a control group of 26 healthy normal-weight women (BMI = 21 +/- 2). Before operation, the obese patients had absolute elevations of all water compartments compared with controls, with significantly higher ratios of Na(e) to TBK (1. 17 +/- 0. 13 versus 0. 91 +/- 0. 10; p less than 0. 05) and ECW to intracellular water (ICW) (E/I = 0. 82 +/- 0. 17 versus 0. 63 +/- 0. 06; p less than 0. 05). After weight loss of 52 +/- 20 kg in MA and 47 +/- 19 kg in GR patients (nonsignificant between groups) to a stable level 22 +/- 8 months after operation, there were statistically significant reductions in TBW, ICW, TBK, and Na(e) in both groups, but {{a significant reduction in}} ECW only after GR. Adjusting for preoperative weight, duration of follow-up, and rate of weight loss, E/I was greater after MA than GR (1. 09 +/- 0. 25 versus 0. 82 +/- 0. 14; p less than 0. 05). The elevated preoperative E/I ratio did not normalize with weight loss after surgery, and the response was related to the type of operation. The finding remains to be explained although the increased E/I after MA may reflect mild protein-calorie malnutrition not detectable in the blood. The persistence of elevated E/I with significant weight loss after GR might imply an intrinsic or irreversible imbalance of fluid distribution in obese patients...|$|R

We present new data for a sample of 6 LR Type II SNe (SNe II), 3 of which were discovered and observed by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and 3 observed by the Caltech Core-Collapse Project (CCCP). Our aim is to enlarge the family of LR SNe II, characterizing their properties. Spectra, LCs, and host-galaxies (HG) of these SNe are presented.

Bolometric properties are derived from the multiband LC. By modeling the early-time LCs with scaling relations derived from the SuperNova Explosion Code (SNEC) models of MESA progenitor stars, we estimate the progenitor radii of these SNe and other progenitor parameters. We present PTF 12 kso, a LR SN II with the largest amount of 56 Ni mass for this class. PTF 09 gpn and PTF 12 kso are found at the lowest HG metallicities for this SN group.

We confirm that LR SNe II with LC shapes closely resembling that of SN 1987 A generally arise from BSGs.

40|$|Context. Supernova (SN) 1987 A was a {{peculiar}} hydrogen-rich event with a long-rising (84 d) light curve, {{stemming from the}} explosion of a compact blue supergiant star. Only a few similar events have been presented in the literature in recent decades. Aims. We present new data for a sample of six long-rising Type II SNe (SNe II), three of which were discovered and observed by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and three observed by the Caltech Core-Collapse Project (CCCP). Our aim is to enlarge this small family of long-rising SNe II, characterizing their differences in terms of progenitor and explosion parameters. We also study the metallicity of their environments. Methods. Optical light curves, spectra, and host-galaxy properties of these SNe are presented and analyzed. Detailed comparisons with known SN 1987 A-like events in the literature are shown, with particular emphasis on the <b>absolute</b> magnitudes, colors, <b>expansion</b> velocities, and host-galaxy metallicities. Bolometric properties are derived from the multiband light curves. By modeling the early time emission with scaling relations derived from the SuperNova Explosion Code (SNEC) models of MESA progenitor stars, we estimate the progenitor radii of these transients. The modeling of the bolometric light curves also allows us to estimate other progenitor and explosion parameters, such as the ejected ^(56) Ni mass, the explosion energy, and the ejecta mass. Results. We present PTF 12 kso, a long-rising SN II that is estimated to have the largest amount of ejected ^(56) Ni mass measured for this class. PTF 09 gpn and PTF 12 kso are found at the lowest host metallicities observed for this SN group. The variety of early light curve luminosities depends on {{the wide range of}} progenitor radii of these SNe, from a few tens of R_⊙ (SN 2005 ci) up to thousands (SN 2004 ek) with some intermediate cases between 100 R_⊙ (PTF 09 gpn) and 300 R_⊙ (SN 2004 em). Conclusions. We confirm that long-rising SNe II with light-curve shapes closely resembling that of SN 1987 A generally arise from blue supergiant (BSG) stars.
