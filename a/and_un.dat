40|$|This paper {{shows how}} nested {{database}} relations {{can be represented}} in the domain theoretic database model and operations nest <b>and</b> <b>unnest</b> can be defined within that model such that unnest ffi nest = id <b>and</b> nest ffi <b>unnest</b> id. We thus get a formal semantics of nested databases as well as operations for nesting and unnesting which keep {{as much information as}} possible and therefore build the ideal passage between relations of different nesting levels. The organisation of the paper is as follows: In Section 1 we give a short introduction to nested relational databases. Section 2 illustrates the domain theoretic approach. In particular, the snack-powerdomain which models set-types is defined, and the interpretation of database relations in the new setting is given. We begin Section 3 with giving an intuitive, picture-oriented account of nested snacks (these will model nested relations). After that we turn to defining nest <b>and</b> <b>unnest</b> <b>and</b> proving the result claimed above. Finally we show how the snack representation of a nested relation behaves under <b>unnest</b> <b>and</b> nest in Section 4. 2 Nested Relational Database...|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} August the North Korean {{troops had}} been pushed beyond their limits {{and many of the}} {{original}} units were at far reduced strength and effectiveness. Logistic problems racked the North Korean Army, and shortages of food, weapons, equipment and replacement soldiers proved devastating for the North Korean units. By late August, the UN command had more combat soldiers in Korea than the North Koreans did, <b>and</b> <b>UN</b> superiority over the air and sea meant the North Koreans were at a disadvantage which was growing daily. North Korean tank losses had been in the hundreds, and they had fewer than 100 tanks {{by the time of the}} Pusan Perimeter fight, to the Americans' 600 tanks. By the end of August the North Koreans' only remaining advantage was their initiative. However, the North Korean force retained high morale and enough supply to allow for a large-scale offensive.|$|E
5|$|Human Rights Watch {{estimates}} UNITA and {{the government}} employed more than 6,000 and 3,000 child soldiers, respectively, some forcibly impressed, during the war.

Some girls were ordered to go and forage for food {{to provide for the}} troops – the girls were denied food if they did not bring back enough to satisfy their commander. After victories, UNITA commanders would be rewarded with women, who were often then sexually abused.

5|$|Operation Medak Pocket {{took place}} in a salient south of Gospić, from September 9–17. The {{offensive}} was undertaken by the Croatian army to stop Serbian artillery in the area from shelling nearby Gospić. The operation met its stated objective of removing the artillery threat, as Croatian troops overran the salient, but it was marred by war crimes. The ICTY later indicted Croatian officers for war crimes. The operation was halted amid international pressure, and an agreement was reached that the Croatian troops were to withdraw to positions held prior to September 9, while UN troops were to occupy the salient alone. The events that followed remain controversial, as Canadian authorities reported that the Croatian army intermittently fought against the advancing Canadian Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry before finally retreating after sustaining 27 fatalities.
