5|$|According to Tchernov's 1962 paper, Passer predomesticus {{was found}} in the middle <b>Acheulean</b> (middle Pleistocene, {{probably}} more than 400,000 years old) layer E1 of the Oumm-Qatafa cave in Wadi Khareitoun near Bethlehem. In 1984, however, Tchernov wrote that P.predomesticus was about 140,000 years old, from the Yabrudian. Layer E1 contained remains of about 40bird species, including a premaxilla Tchernov described as a precursor of the Dead Sea sparrow (Passer moabiticus) and a tarsometatarsus and humerus tentatively allied with the house sparrow. An undetermined <b>Acheulean</b> layer of the same cave also contained fossils Tchernov described as precursors of both the house and Spanish sparrows.|$|E
5|$|Discoveries of <b>Acheulean</b> {{stone tools}} suggest Póvoa de Varzim has been {{inhabited}} since the Lower Palaeolithic, around 200,000BC. The first groups of shepherds {{settled on the}} coast where Póvoa de Varzim is now located between the 4th millennium and early 2nd millennium BC. A Neolithic-Calcolithic necropolis, with seven known burial mounds, can still be seen around São Félix Hill and Cividade Hill.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{abstract}} thinking {{can be seen}} in the archaeological record as early as the Acheulean-Middle Stone Age transition, approximately 300,000-250,000 years ago. This transition involves a shift in stone tool technology from Mode 2, <b>Acheulean</b> tools, to Mode 3 and 4, which include blades and microliths. The manufacture of these tools requires planning and the understanding of how striking a stone will produce different flaking patterns. This requires abstract thought, one of the hallmarks of modern human behavior. The shift from large cutting tools in the Acheulian to smaller and more diversified toolkits in the MSA represents a better cognitive and conceptual understanding of flintknapping, as well as the potential functional effects of distinct tool types.|$|E
5|$|Now often also {{considered}} a distinct species, Homo neanderthalensis (otherwise known as Homo sapiens neanderthalensis) {{lived in the}} southern half of Poland during the Middle Paleolithic period, that is between 300,000 and 40,000 BCE. Various relics were found and different Neanderthal cultures are distinguished. <b>Acheulean</b> handaxes from Silesia dated 200,000-180,000 years ago are among the older tools. Gatherer-hunter sporadic groups of Neanderthals penetrated southern Poland also during the Eemian interglacial, 128,000-115,000 BCE. Examination of the Micoquien-Prądnik culture (East Micoquien complex) sites in the Prądnik River Valley north of Kraków and in Zwoleń near Radom from about 85,000 to 70,000 BCE (early phase of the Vistula River glaciation period) shows that some Neanderthals were skilled collective hunters, able to kill numerous large mammals characteristic of the cold Pleistocene climate and process the meat, skin and bones using specialized tools.|$|E
25|$|As {{the period}} of <b>Acheulean</b> tool use is so vast, efforts {{have been made to}} {{classify}} various stages of it such as John Wymer's division into Early <b>Acheulean,</b> Middle <b>Acheulean,</b> Late Middle <b>Acheulean</b> and Late <b>Acheulean</b> for material from Britain. These schemes are normally regional and their dating and interpretations vary.|$|E
25|$|The very {{earliest}} <b>Acheulean</b> assemblages often contain numerous Oldowan-style {{flakes and}} core forms {{and it is}} almost certain that the <b>Acheulean</b> developed from this older industry. These industries are known as the Developed Oldowan and are almost certainly transitional between the Oldowan and <b>Acheulean.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mode 3 {{technology}} emerged {{towards the}} end of <b>Acheulean</b> dominance and involved the Levallois technique, most famously exploited by the Mousterian industry. Transitional tool forms between the two are called Mousterian of <b>Acheulean</b> Tradition, or MTA types. The long blades of the Upper Palaeolithic Mode 4 industries appeared long after the <b>Acheulean</b> was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acheulean</b> {{tools were}} not made by fully modern humans – that is, Homo sapiens – {{although}} the early or non-modern (transitional) Homo sapiens idaltu did use Late <b>Acheulean</b> tools, as did the proto-Neanderthal species. Most notably, however, it is Homo ergaster (sometimes called early Homo erectus), whose assemblages are almost exclusively <b>Acheulean,</b> who used the technique. Later, the related species Homo heidelbergensis (the common ancestor of both Neanderthals and Homo sapiens) used it extensively.|$|E
25|$|Relative dating {{techniques}} (based on {{a presumption}} that technology progresses over time) suggest that <b>Acheulean</b> tools followed on from earlier, cruder tool-making methods, {{but there is}} considerable chronological overlap in early prehistoric stone-working industries, with evidence in some regions that <b>Acheulean</b> tool-using groups were contemporary with other, less sophisticated industries such as the Clactonian and then later with the more sophisticated Mousterian, as well. It is therefore important not to see the <b>Acheulean</b> as a neatly defined period or one that happened {{as part of a}} clear sequence but as one tool-making technique that flourished especially well in early prehistory. The enormous geographic spread of <b>Acheulean</b> techniques also makes the name unwieldy as it represents numerous regional variations on a similar theme. The term <b>Acheulean</b> does not represent a common culture in the modern sense, rather it is a basic method for making stone tools that was shared across much of the Old World.|$|E
25|$|Lower Paleolithic <b>Acheulean</b> tool users, {{according}} to Robert G. Bednarik, began {{to engage in}} symbolic behavior such as art around 850,000BP. They decorated themselves with beads and collected exotic stones for aesthetic, rather than utilitarian qualities. According to him, traces of the pigment ochre from late Lower Paleolithic <b>Acheulean</b> archaeological sites suggests that <b>Acheulean</b> societies, like later Upper Paleolithic societies, collected and used ochre to create rock art. Nevertheless, {{it is also possible}} that the ochre traces found at Lower Paleolithic sites is naturally occurring.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1980s, it {{was thought}} that the humans who arrived in East Asia {{abandoned}} the hand-axe technology of their ancestors and adopted chopper tools instead. An apparent division between <b>Acheulean</b> and non-Acheulean tool industries was identified by Hallam L. Movius, who drew the Movius Line across northern India to show where the traditions seemed to diverge. Later finds of <b>Acheulean</b> tools at Chongokni in South Korea and also in Mongolia and China, however, cast doubt on the reliability of Movius's distinction. Since then, a different division known as the Roe Line has been suggested. This runs across North Africa to Israel and thence to India, separating two different techniques used by <b>Acheulean</b> toolmakers. North and east of the Roe Line, <b>Acheulean</b> hand-axes were made directly from large stone nodules and cores; while, to the south and west, they were made from flakes struck from these nodules.|$|E
25|$|In colder Eurasian times, the hominin diet {{would have}} to be principally meat-based and <b>Acheulean</b> hunters must have competed with cats.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} Paleolithic stone tool industry, the Oldowan, began around 2.6million years ago. It contained {{tools such}} as choppers, burins, and stitching awls. It was completely replaced around 250,000 {{years ago by the}} more complex <b>Acheulean</b> industry, which was first conceived by Homo ergaster around 1.8–1.65million years ago. The <b>Acheulean</b> implements completely vanish from the archaeological record around 100,000 years ago and were replaced by more complex Middle Paleolithic tool kits such as the Mousterian and the Aterian industries.|$|E
25|$|C. A Bergmann/M. B. Roberts, Flaking {{technology}} at the <b>Acheulean</b> site of Boxgrove, West Sussex, England. Rev. Arch. Picardie, Numero Special, 1–2, 1988, 105–113.|$|E
25|$|From {{geological}} dating of sedimentary deposits, {{it appears}} that the <b>Acheulean</b> originated in Africa and spread to Asian, Middle Eastern, and European areas sometime between 1.5 million years ago and about 800 thousand years ago. In individual regions, this dating can be considerably refined; in Europe for example, it was thought that <b>Acheulean</b> methods did not reach the continent until around 500,000 years ago. However more recent research demonstrated that hand-axes from Spain were made more than 900,000 years ago.|$|E
25|$|The type {{site for}} the <b>Acheulean</b> is Saint-Acheul, a suburb of Amiens, {{the capital of the}} Somme {{department}} in Picardy, where artifacts were found in 1859.|$|E
25|$|Final shaping {{was then}} {{applied to the}} usable cutting edge of the tool, again using fine removal of flakes. Some <b>Acheulean</b> tools were {{sharpened}} instead by the removal of a tranchet flake. This was struck from the lateral edge of the hand-axe close to the intended cutting area, resulting in the removal of a flake running along (parallel to) the blade of the axe to create a neat and very sharp working edge. This distinctive tranchet flake can be identified amongst flint-knapping debris at <b>Acheulean</b> sites.|$|E
25|$|In 1872, Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet {{described}} the characteristic hand-axe tools {{as belonging to}} L'Epoque de St Acheul. The industry was renamed as the <b>Acheulean</b> in 1925.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Soviet archaeologists {{discovered}} {{the bones of}} a pre-Homo sapiens human dating back possibly to the Middle <b>Acheulean</b> culture in a cave {{near the village of}} Azokh in the province of Hadrut.|$|E
25|$|A {{more refined}} and later version of handaxe {{production}} {{was found in}} the Abbeville/Somme River district. The more refined handaxe became known as the <b>Acheulean</b> industry, named after Saint-Acheul, today a suburb of Amiens.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographic}} {{distribution of}} <b>Acheulean</b> tools – {{and thus the}} peoples who made them – is often interpreted as being the result of palaeo-climatic and ecological factors, such as glaciation and the desertification of the Sahara Desert.|$|E
25|$|The kill site at Boxgrove in England {{is another}} famous <b>Acheulean</b> site. Up until the 1970s these kill sites, often at waterholes where animals would gather to drink, were {{interpreted}} as being where <b>Acheulean</b> tool users killed game, butchered their carcasses, and then discarded the tools they had used. Since {{the advent of}} zooarchaeology, which has placed greater emphasis on studying animal bones from archaeological sites, this view has changed. Many of the animals at these kill sites {{have been found to}} have been killed by other predator animals, so it is likely that humans of the period supplemented hunting with scavenging from already dead animals.|$|E
25|$|The {{symmetry}} of the hand-axes {{has been used}} to suggest that <b>Acheulean</b> tool users possessed the ability to use language; the parts of the brain connected with fine control and movement are located in the same region that controls speech. The wider variety of tool types compared to earlier industries and their aesthetically as well as functionally pleasing form could indicate a higher intellectual level in <b>Acheulean</b> tool users than in earlier hominines. Others argue that there is no correlation between spatial abilities in tool making and linguistic behaviour, and that language is not learned or conceived {{in the same manner as}} artefact manufacture.|$|E
25|$|Excavation of the Nile has exposed early stone tools. The {{earliest}} {{of these}} lithic industries were {{located within the}} 30-metre (100 ft) terrace, and were Chellean, primitive <b>Acheulean</b> and an Egyptian form of the Clactonian. Within the 15-metre (50 ft) terrace was developed <b>Acheulean.</b> Originally reported as Early Mousterian but since changed to Levalloisean, other implements were located in the 10-metre (30 ft) terrace. The 4.5- and 3-metre (15-10 ft) terraces saw a more developed version of the Levalloisean, also initially reported as an Egyptian version of Mousterian. Finally, tools of the Egyptian Sebilian technology and an Egyptian version of the Aterian technology were also located.|$|E
25|$|Paradoxically, {{within the}} wide range of <b>Acheulean</b> objects, hand axes are one of the {{simplest}} tools. They do not require as much planning as other types of object, generally made from flakes, that are less striking but more sophisticated.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{innovation}} {{associated with}} <b>Acheulean</b> hand-axes {{is that the}} stone was worked symmetrically and on both sides. For the latter reason, handaxes are, along with cleavers, bifacially worked tools that could be manufactured from the large flakes themselves or from prepared cores.|$|E
25|$|In 1872, Gabriel de Mortillet, who {{named the}} great periods of {{prehistory}} in France, decided {{to name the}} stone tools gathered in large numbers at Saint-Acheul as <b>Acheulean.</b> The Amiens site then became the reference for the main features of the lower Palaeolithic.|$|E
25|$|Tool types {{found in}} <b>Acheulean</b> assemblages include pointed, cordate, ovate, ficron, and bout-coupé hand-axes (referring to {{the shapes of}} the final tool), cleavers, {{retouched}} flakes, scrapers, and segmental chopping tools. Materials used were determined by available local stone types; flint is most often associated with the tools but its use is concentrated in Western Europe; in Africa sedimentary and igneous rock such as mudstone and basalt were most widely used, for example. Other source materials include chalcedony, quartzite, andesite, sandstone, chert, and shale. Even relatively soft rock such as limestone could be exploited. In all cases the toolmakers worked their handaxes close to the source of their raw materials, suggesting that the <b>Acheulean</b> was a set of skills passed between individual groups.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acheulean</b> {{stone tools}} {{have been found}} across the {{continent}} of Africa, save for the dense rainforest around the River Congo which is not {{thought to have been}} colonized by hominids until later. It is thought that from Africa their use spread north and east to Asia: from Anatolia, through the Arabian Peninsula, across modern day Iran and Pakistan, and into India, and beyond. In Europe their users reached the Pannonian Basin and the western Mediterranean regions, modern day France, the Low Countries, western Germany, and southern and central Britain. Areas further north did not see human occupation until much later, due to glaciation. In Athirampakkam at Chennai in Tamil Nadu the <b>Acheulean</b> age started at 1.51 mya and it is also prior than North India and Europe.|$|E
25|$|Nucleiform bifaces—It is {{difficult}} to distinguish a true biface from a core with modified edges that was occasionally used as a tool. A piece {{could also be a}} blank or a chance occurrence. Despite their rough appearance, nucleiform bifaces were present in both the <b>Acheulean</b> and the Mousterian.|$|E
25|$|In {{the four}} {{divisions}} of prehistoric stone-working, <b>Acheulean</b> artefacts {{are classified as}} Mode 2, meaning they are more advanced than the (usually earlier) Mode 1 tools of the Clactonian or Oldowan/Abbevillian industries but lacking the sophistication of the (usually later) Mode 3 Middle Palaeolithic technology, exemplified by the Mousterian industry.|$|E
25|$|Use-wear {{analysis}} on <b>Acheulean</b> tools suggests there was generally no specialization {{in the different}} types created {{and that they were}} multi-use implements. Functions included hacking wood from a tree, cutting animal carcasses as well as scraping and cutting hides when necessary. Some tools, however, could have been better suited to digging roots or butchering animals than others.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the sheer}} amount of handaxes {{found at the}} site, Kariandusi was {{once thought to be}} a factory for <b>Acheulean</b> handaxes. It was also once thought of as one of the oldest in situ <b>Acheulean</b> hand axe site in the world. When it was discovered, the {{researchers}} believed it had been untouched since the last stoneworker had left. However, recent climate research has revealed that nearby Lake Elmenteita once reached further inland, and has receded in the past one million years. The collection at Kariandusi accumulated due to the water rushing over the land and depositing the hand axes there. The denial of this site as a factory is supported by the lack of waste found at the site. There are no flakes or debris left over from the creation of the handaxes, which one would be sure to find at a designated factory.|$|E
25|$|Only limited artefactual {{evidence}} survives of {{the users}} of <b>Acheulean</b> tools {{other than the}} stone tools themselves. Cave sites were exploited for habitation, but the hunter-gatherers of the Palaeolithic also possibly built shelters such as those identified in connection with <b>Acheulean</b> tools at Grotte du Lazaret and Terra Amata near Nice in France. The presence of the shelters is inferred from large rocks at the sites, {{which may have been}} used to weigh down the bottoms of tent-like structures or serve as foundations for huts or windbreaks. These stones may have been naturally deposited. In any case, a flimsy wood or animal skin structure would leave few archaeological traces after so much time. Fire was seemingly being exploited by Homo ergaster, and would have been a necessity in colonising colder Eurasia from Africa. Conclusive evidence of mastery over it this early is, however, difficult to find.|$|E
25|$|Some smaller {{tools were}} made from large flakes that had been struck from stone cores. These flake tools and the {{distinctive}} waste flakes produced in <b>Acheulean</b> tool manufacture suggest a more considered technique, one that required the toolmaker to think one or two steps ahead during work that necessitated a clear sequence of steps to create perhaps several tools in one sitting.|$|E
25|$|The Lower Paleolithic {{period was}} the {{earliest}} subdivision of the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age. It spans {{the time from}} around 2.5 million {{years ago when the}} first evidence of craft and use of stone tools by hominids appears in the current archaeological record, until around 300,000 years ago, spanning the Oldowan ("mode 1") and <b>Acheulean</b> ("mode 2") lithic technology.|$|E
