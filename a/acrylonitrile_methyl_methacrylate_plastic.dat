Cortical bone samples are processed and embedded undecalcified in <b>methyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> <b>plastic.</b> After sectioning at 3 - 5 microns, cross-sections are {{transferred to a}} glass slide and flattened for 10 min.

Reversal lines appear as thin, scalloped, dark blue lines against a light blue matrix, whereas bone formation arrest lines are thicker with a smooth contour.

We studied several couples of monomers chosen among four molecules: <b>acrylonitrile,</b> methacrylonitrile, <b>methyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> and glycidyl methacrylate. In order to achieve simultaneous electrografting of both monomers, it is necessary to take into account the following molecular parameters: (i) the respective reduction potentials of the two monomers, (ii) the relative nucleophilicity of the anions propagating the reaction, (iii) the molecular structure of the neutral molecules.

40|$|Abstract- Poly <b>Methyl</b> <b>MethAcrylate</b> (PMMA) based <b>plastic</b> {{optical fibres}} offer a low cost {{radiation}} monitoring solution {{with a wide}} dose range, capable of providing real-time, online information. The sensitivity of the fibre to ionising radiation is shown to be dependant on wavelength, with the sensitivity increasing with decreasing wavelength, and so by carefully selecting the monitoring wavelength, the desired sensitivity and dose range can be achieved. The fibres exhibit high sensitivity, up to 0. 6 dBm- 1 /kGy, and are capable of monitoring dose ranges between 30 Gy and 45 kGy. This exceeds the sensing range of all commercially available PMMA slab sensors, allowing it {{to be used for}} a wide range of applications...|$|R
