5|$|The Moon crosses {{from south}} to {{north of the}} {{ecliptic}} at its <b>ascending</b> <b>node,</b> and vice versa at its descending node. However, the nodes of the Moon's orbit are gradually moving in a retrograde motion, due to {{the action of the}} Sun's gravity on the Moon's motion, and they make a complete circuit every 18.6 years. This regression means that the time between each passage of the Moon through the <b>ascending</b> <b>node</b> is slightly shorter than the sidereal month. This period is called the nodical or draconic month.|$|E
5|$|The group {{generally}} has an Inclination of roughly 140 degrees, a perihelion distance of around 0.01 AU, and a Longitude of <b>ascending</b> <b>node</b> of 340–10°.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclination}} of {{a planet}} tells how far above or below an established reference plane its orbit lies. In the Solar System, the reference plane is the plane of Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic. For extrasolar planets, the plane, known as the sky plane or plane of the sky, is the plane perpendicular to the observer's line of sight from Earth. The eight planets of the Solar System all lie {{very close to the}} ecliptic; comets and Kuiper belt objects like Pluto are at far more extreme angles to it. The points at which a planet crosses above and below its reference plane are called its ascending and descending nodes. The longitude of the <b>ascending</b> <b>node</b> is the angle between the reference plane's 0 longitude and the planet's <b>ascending</b> <b>node.</b> The argument of periapsis (or perihelion in the Solar System) is the angle between a planet's <b>ascending</b> <b>node</b> and its closest approach to its star.|$|E

5|$|The highest {{altitude}} of the Moon {{in the sky}} varies with the lunar phase and the season of the year. The full moon is highest during winter. The 18.61-year nodes cycle also has an influence: when the <b>ascending</b> <b>node</b> of the lunar orbit is in the vernal equinox, the lunar declination can {{go as far as}} 28° each month. This means the Moon can go overhead at latitudes up to 28° from the equator, instead of only 18°. The orientation of the Moon's crescent also depends on the latitude of the observation site: close to the equator, an observer can see a smile-shaped crescent moon.|$|E
5|$|Thus after 243 {{years the}} transits of Venus return. The 1874 transit {{is a member}} of the 243-year cycle #1. The 1882 transit {{is a member of}} #2. The 2004 transit is a member of #3 and the 2012 transit is a member of #4. The 2117 transit is a member of #1 and so on. However, the <b>ascending</b> <b>node</b> (December transits) of the orbit of Venus moves {{backwards}} after each 243 years so the transit of 2854 is the last member of series #3 instead of series #1. The descending node (June transits) moves forwards, so the transit of 3705 is the last member of #2.|$|E
5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the <b>ascending</b> <b>node</b> of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5|$|The bending of the Laplace {{plane of}} the Solar System toward that of Planet Nine's orbit can produce the {{apparent}} clustering of the longitude of the <b>ascending</b> <b>nodes</b> and arguments of perihelion of the extreme TNOs. The Laplace plane defines the center about which the pole of an object's orbit precesses with time. At larger semi-major axes the angular momentum of Planet Nine causes the Laplace plane to bend toward that of its orbit. As a result, when the poles of the eTNO orbit precess about the Laplace plane, they tend to remain {{on one side of}} the ecliptic pole. For objects with small inclination relative to Planet Nine, which were found to be more stable in simulations, this off-center precession resembles a libration of the longitudes of <b>ascending</b> <b>nodes</b> with respect to the ecliptic making them appear clustered. In combination with the anti-alignment of the longitudes of perihelion this can also produce clustering of the arguments of perihelion.|$|R
5|$|On January 20, 2016, Brown and Konstantin Batygin {{published}} an article corroborating Trujillo and Sheppard's initial findings; proposing a super-Earth (dubbed Planet Nine) based on a statistical clustering of the arguments of perihelia (noted before) near zero and also <b>ascending</b> <b>nodes</b> near 113° of six distant trans-Neptunian objects. They estimated it to be ten times the mass of Earth (about 60% the mass of Neptune) with a semimajor axis of approximately 400–1500 AU.|$|R

25|$|The draconic {{month is}} the time from <b>ascending</b> <b>node</b> to <b>ascending</b> <b>node.</b> The time between two {{successive}} passes of the same ecliptic longitude is called the tropical month. The latter three periods are slightly different from the sidereal month.|$|E

5|$|In a {{paper by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos {{evidence}} is shown {{for a possible}} bimodal distribution of the distances to the <b>ascending</b> <b>nodes</b> of the ETNOs. This correlation {{is unlikely to be}} the result of observational bias since it also appears in the nodal distribution of large semi-major axis centaurs and comets. If it is due to the extreme TNOs experiencing close approaches to Planet Nine, it is consistent with a planet with a semi-major axis of 300–400 AU.|$|R

25|$|The great {{meteor shower}} of November 1866 turned his {{attention}} to the Leonids, whose probable path and period had already been discussed and predicted by Hubert Anson Newton in 1864. Newton had asserted that the longitude of the <b>ascending</b> <b>node,</b> that marked where the shower would occur, was increasing and the problem of explaining this variation attracted some of Europe's leading astronomers.|$|E
25|$|This eclipse {{occurred}} at the descending node of the moon's orbit. Lunar eclipses are always paired with a solar eclipse either 2 weeks before or after at new moon in the opposite node.

25|$|A secular {{resonance}} {{occurs when}} the precession of two orbits is synchronised (usually a precession of the perihelion or <b>ascending</b> <b>node).</b> A small body in secular resonance with a much larger one (e.g. a planet) will precess {{at the same rate}} as the large body. Over long times (a million years, or so) a secular resonance will change the eccentricity and inclination of the small body.|$|E
25|$|The Delaunay orbital elements, {{commonly}} referred to as Delaunay variables, are action-angle coordinates consisting of the argument of periapsis, the mean anomaly and the longitude of the <b>ascending</b> <b>node,</b> along with their conjugate momenta. They are used to simplify perturbative calculations in celestial mechanics, for example while investigating the Kozai-Lidov oscillations in hierarchical triple systems. They were introduced by Charles-Eugène Delaunay during his study of the motion of the Moon.|$|E
25|$|Also {{important}} in astrology are the moon's nodes. The nodes are where the moon's path crosses the ecliptic. The North, or <b>Ascending</b> <b>Node</b> marks {{the place where}} the moon crosses from South to North (or ascends), while the South, or Descending Node marks where the moon crosses from North to South (or descends). While Lunar nodes are not considered by Western astrologers to be as important a factor as each of the planets, they are thought to mark sensitive areas that are worth taking into account.|$|E
500|$|Batygin and Brown {{also found}} that the orbits of the six objects with semi-major axes greater than 250 AU and perihelia beyond 30 AU (namely Sedna, , , , , and [...] ) were aligned in space with their perihelia in roughly the same direction, {{resulting}} in a clustering of their longitudes of perihelion. The orbits of the six objects were also tilted with respect to that of the ecliptic and approximately co-planar, producing a clustering of their longitudes of <b>ascending</b> <b>nodes.</b> They determined that there was only a 0.007% likelihood that this combination of alignments was due to chance.|$|R

On time scales of 100, 000 to 1, 000, 000 yr, two bands are formed {{on each side of the}} ecliptic for each collision; the IRAS band pairs are probably due to collisions of aproximately 15 -km diameter asteroids which occurred within the last several million yr.

25|$|Saros {{series are}} {{numbered}} {{according to the}} type of eclipse (solar or lunar) and whether they occur at the Moon's ascending or descending node. Odd numbers are used for solar eclipses occurring near the <b>ascending</b> <b>node,</b> whereas even numbers are given to descending node solar eclipses. For lunar eclipses, this numbering scheme is somewhat random. The ordering of these series is determined by the time at which each series peaks, which corresponds to when an eclipse is closest to one of the lunar nodes. For solar eclipses, the 40 series numbered between 117 and 156 are active, whereas for lunar eclipses, there are now 41 active saros series.|$|E
25|$|Different sets of {{elements}} {{are used for}} various astronomical bodies. The eccentricity, , and either the semi-major axis, , or the distance of periapsis, , are used to specify the shape and size of an orbit. The angle of the <b>ascending</b> <b>node,</b> , the inclination, , and the argument of periapsis, , or the longitude of periapsis, , specify {{the orientation of the}} orbit in its plane. Either the longitude at epoch, , the mean anomaly at epoch, , or the time of perihelion passage, , are used to specify a known point in the orbit. The choices made depend whether the vernal equinox or the node are used as the primary reference. The semi-major axis is known if the mean motion and the gravitational mass are known.|$|E
25|$|Transits of Earth from Mars usually {{occur in}} pairs, with one {{following}} the other after 79 years; rarely, {{there are three}} in the series. The transits also follow a 284-year cycle, occurring at intervals of 100.5, 79, 25.5, and 79 years; a transit falling on a particular date is usually followed by another transit 284 years later. Transits occurring when Mars is at its <b>ascending</b> <b>node</b> are in May, those at descending node happen in November. This cycle corresponds fairly closely to 151 Mars orbits, 284 Earth orbits, and 133 synodic periods, and {{is analogous to the}} cycle of transits of Venus from Earth, which follow a cycle of 243 years (121.5, 8, 105.5, 8).

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method to}} find suitable Mars parking orbits is developed which {{takes into account}} geometries associated with the asymptotes, along with the nodal precession caused by the oblateness of Mars. A selected orbital plane which contains the arrival asymptote precesses through the stay time to the plane also containing the departure asymptote. The parking orbit is co-planar with both the arrival and departure asymptotes and only in-plane burns are required at both Mars arrival and departure. The need for a plane change at Mars departure to achieve the proper velocity vector for earth return is eliminated.
