25|$|In 1886–87 {{when the}} Royal E. House Telegraph was {{produced}} with the printing telegraph, the Morse Telegraph tried to enjoin them from infringing the Morse patents. Morse claimed the sole right of transmitting intelligence by electricity (which utilized the Morse code). The courts decided the House Company did not infringe the Morse patent {{in the slightest}} degree, as the messages using the House system were all printed on <b>a</b> <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> paper, while the Morse signals were embosed and in code (dots and dashes) which afterwards were translated into words.|$|E

After his disappearance, Balochistan Union of Journalists requested government intervention. His corpse was found 5 November 2011 near Ghazgi Chowk, Khuzdar, and his corpse had multiple bullet wounds, showed evidence of torture, and was found with <b>a</b> <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> paper identifying him as the journalist who had been previously kidnapped. His corpse was then transported to the civil hospital in Khuzdar for an autopsy.|$|E
25|$|At the time, Lai Min's old debating rival, Meng Guang, was as equally {{notorious for}} being {{unbridled}} {{in his speech}} and was, in some ways, worse than Lai Min in this regard. Meng Guang not only carelessly divulged state secrets (probably due to <b>a</b> <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> the tongue), but also discussed politics in an inappropriate setting. Nevertheless, both of them got off lightly because they held much prestige among the literati for their status as learned Confucian scholars. Lai Min, in particular, came from an elite family background and had previously served as an attendant to the Shu emperor Liu Shan when the emperor was still crown prince, therefore {{he was able to}} return to service every time after he got fired.|$|E

25|$|They seem to {{have drawn}} on {{the map of the}} world {{published}} in Florence in 1489 by Henricus Martellus, in which provincia boëach appears as the southern neighbour of provincia ciamba. Book III of Marco Polo’s Il Milione described his journey by sea from China to India by way of Champa (= Southern Vietnam), Java (which he called Java Major), Locach and Sumatra (called Java Minor). After a chapter describing the kingdom of Champa there follows a chapter describing Java (which he did not visit himself). The narrative then resumes, describing the route southward from Champa toward Sumatra, but by <b>a</b> <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> the pen the name “Java” was substituted for “Champa” as the point of departure, locating Sumatra 1,300 miles to the south of Java instead of Champa. Locach, located between Champa and Sumatra, was likewise misplaced far to the south of Java, by some geographers on or near an extension of the Terra Australis.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{his career}} in the Shu government, Meng Guang was notorious for making public outbursts on {{numerous}} occasions and for being very unbridled in his speech. As a result, his colleagues generally disliked or detested him. There were also instances where he carelessly divulged state secrets (probably due to <b>a</b> <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> the tongue) and discussed politics in inappropriate settings. However, he got off lightly because he held much prestige among the literati for his status as a learned Confucian scholar. Meng Guang's behaviour had a huge negative impact on his career: he never made it to higher positions – his highest appointment was Minister of Finance (大司農) – and never received any honours/privileges (e.g., a marquis title). Two of his colleagues, Minister of Ceremonies Xin Cheng (鐔承) and Minister of the Household Pei Jun (裴儁), were younger and less experienced than him, yet they made it to positions higher than his.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} cylinder boxes have a plain {{brown paper}} exterior, sometimes rubber-stamped {{with the company}} name. By the late 1890s, record companies usually pasted a generic printed label around {{the outside of the}} box, sometimes with a penciled catalog number but no other indication of the identity of the recording inside. <b>A</b> <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> paper stating the title and performer was placed inside the box with the cylinder. At first this information was hand-written or typed on each slip, but printed versions became more common once cylinders were sold in large enough quantities to justify the printing set-up cost. The recording itself usually began with a spoken announcement of the title and performer and also the name of the record company. On a typical Edison record slip from 1903, the consumer is invited to cut off a coupon with the printed information and paste it onto the lid of the box. Alternatively, a circular area within the coupon could be cut out and pasted onto the end of a spindle for that cylinder in one of the specially built cases and cabinets made for storing cylinder records. Only a minority of cylinder record customers purchased such storage units, however. Slightly later, the record number was stamped on the lid, then later still a printed label with the title and artist information was factory-applied to the lid. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, an abbreviated version of this information was impressed into or printed on one edge of the cylinder itself.|$|E

It is found as <b>a</b> <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> muscle or fascia extending between the latissimus dorsi muscle and the pectoralis major. There is considerable variation in the exact position of its origin and insertions as well as its blood and nerve supply. Its presence in different ethnic groups varies, being present in about 7% of Europeans and with higher rates in the Chinese and less common in the Turkish population. The arch may occur on one or both sides of the body.|$|E

They must remain in the sewers until either they are released by the Gatekeeper, or collect the Keystone which allows them to release themselves.|$|E
