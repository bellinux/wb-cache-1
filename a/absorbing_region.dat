A thin absorption region of thickness d is sandwiched between two relatively less <b>absorbing</b> <b>region,</b> substrate, of thickness L1 and L2. The optical cavity is formed by a period of λ/4 distributed Bragg reflector (DBR), made of non-absorbing larger bandgap materials, at the both end of the substrate. The front mirror has a transmittance of t1 and generally has lower reflectivity than compare to the mirror at back (R1 < R2 [...] ). Transmittance t1 allows light {{to enter into the}} cavity, and reflectivity R1 (=r12) and R2 (=r22) provides the optical confinement in the cavity.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} used grid truncation techniques for open-region FDTD modeling problems are the Mur absorbing boundary condition (ABC), the Liao ABC, and various perfectly matched layer (PML) formulations. The Mur and Liao techniques are simpler than PML. However, PML (which is technically an <b>absorbing</b> <b>region</b> rather than a boundary condition per se) can provide orders-of-magnitude lower reflections. The PML concept was introduced by J.-P. Berenger in a seminal 1994 paper in the Journal of Computational Physics. [...] Since 1994, Berenger's original split-field implementation has been modified and extended to the uniaxial PML (UPML), the convolutional PML (CPML), and the higher-order PML. The latter two PML formulations have increased ability to absorb evanescent waves, and therefore can in principle be placed closer to a simulated scattering or radiating structure than Berenger's original formulation.|$|E

The {{latter are}} the source of radiation generated via spontaneous and stimulated emission, which embodies quantum noise and can result in lasing. We calculate the frequency-resolved output radiation intensity of such systems and relate it to a suitable measure of excess noise and mode nonorthogonality. The line shape differs depending on whether the emission lines are isolated (as for weakly amplifying, almost-Hermitian systems) or overlapping (as for the almost-degenerate resonances in the vicinity of exceptional points associated with spontaneous PT-symmetry breaking). The calculations are carried out in the scattering input-output formalism, and are illustrated for a quasi-one-dimensional resonator setup. In our derivations, we also consider the more general case of a resonator in which the amplifying and <b>absorbing</b> <b>regions</b> are not related by symmetry...|$|R

40|$|Optical {{absorption}} is omnipresent {{and very}} often distributed non-uniformly in space. We present a numerical study {{on the effects of}} inhomogeneous absorption on transmission eigenchannels of light in highly scattering media. In the weak absorption regime, the spatial profile of a transmission channel remains very similar to that without absorption, and the effect of inhomogeneous absorption can be stronger or weaker than homogeneous absorption depending on the spatial overlap of the localized <b>absorbing</b> <b>region</b> with the field intensity maximum of the channel. In the strong absorption regime, the high transmission channels redirect the energy flows to circumvent the absorbing regions to minimize loss. The attenuation of high transmission channels by inhomogeneous absorption is lower than that by homogeneous absorption, regardless of the location of the <b>absorbing</b> <b>region.</b> The statistical distribution of transmission eigenvalues in the former becomes broader than that in the latter, due to a longer tail at high transmission. Since the maximum transmission channel is the most efficient in bypassing the <b>absorbing</b> <b>region,</b> the ratio of its transmittance to the average transmittance increases with absorption, eventually exceeds the ratio without absorption.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} microwave-source time-resolved {{infrared radiometry}} (MW-TRIR) {{as a method}} for the detection and characterization of microwave absorption by conductive fibers and other <b>absorbing</b> <b>regions</b> in dielectric materials. Due to recent technical developments in the speed, detector array size, and sensitivity of infrared focalplane arrays, time-resolved infrared radiometry has evolved into an important NDE tool which allows fast area inspection at high spatial resolution. While much prior work {{has focused on the}} detection of structural defects or disbonds in a variety of materials [1, 2], the increasing importance of composite materials requires new approaches to inspection which allow characterization of local material properties. Defects in such materials may have little thermal contrast compared to the matrix material and may be invisible using conventional infrared radiometry methods. However, where the embedding material is a weak microwave absorber, localized microwave <b>absorbing</b> <b>regions</b> can be detected easily. There are three different classes of absorption processes: (1) dielectric loss (e. g. water), (2) magnetic loss, and (3) Joule heating (e. g. electromagnetic radiation interaction with conducting fibers) ...|$|R

The linear transmission of dye in PMMA-PA film was about 10 %. The nonlinear absorption properties leading to optical limiting using 532 nm pico second and nano second pulses are studied. From the results, it can be noted that at very low input intensity, linear transmission is preserved, with increase in input intensity DASPB starts to contribute to saturation absorption which increases the transmission above linear level, and at higher intensities the excited state frequency up-converted fluorescence (nonlinear absorption) starts to contribute and it dominates with further increase in intensity.

40|$|High-resolution {{spectroscopy}} of {{the absorption}} lines associated with four intermediate-redshift galaxies are presented. These observations are combined with existing spectroscopy of the redshifted 21 -cm absorption lines toward 0235 + 164 and 1229 - 021. Evidence {{is presented to}} the effect that the lines of sight through the absorbers toward 0235 + 164 and 1229 - 021 penetrate material for which the velocity fields are dominated by systematic rather than by random motions, and the line profiles are found to be consistent with what is expected for rotating ensembles of clouds. It is suggested that for these two absorbers the absorption arises in individual clouds within single galaxy halos rather than, for example, in collections of coalescing subgalactic fragments, for which the expected velocity fields are more turbulent, or as a result of galaxy-galaxy clustering. It is concluded that lines of sight that impact <b>absorbing</b> <b>regions</b> at small impact parameters intercept many clouds, sample large velocity intervals, and are likely to show redshifted 21 -cm absorption, whereas lines of sight that impact <b>absorbing</b> <b>regions</b> at large impact parameters intercept few clouds, sample small velocity intervals, and are unlikely to show redshifted 21 -cm absorption...|$|R
40|$|Observations of the Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) forest {{may allow}} reionization to {{complete}} {{as late as}} z ∼ 5. 5, provided the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is sufficiently inhomogeneous at these redshifts. In this case, significantly neutral islands may remain amongst highly ionized gas with the ionized regions allowing some transmission through the Ly-α forest. This possibility has the important virtue that it is eminently testable with existing Ly-α forest data. In particular, we describe three observable signatures of significantly neutral gas in the z ∼ 5. 5 IGM. We use mock quasar spectra produced from numerical simulations of reionization to develop these tests. First, we quantify how the abundance and length of <b>absorbed</b> <b>regions</b> in the forest increase with the volume-averaged neutral fraction in our reionization model. Second, we consider stacking the transmission profile around highly <b>absorbed</b> <b>regions</b> in the forest. If and only if there is significantly neutral gas in the IGM, absorption in the damping wing of the Ly-α line will cause the transmission to recover slowly as one moves from absorbed to transmitted portions of the spectrum. Third, the deuterium Ly-β line should imprint a small but distinctive absorption feature slightly blueward of <b>absorbed</b> neutral <b>regions</b> in the Ly-β forest. We show that these tests {{can be carried out}} with existing Keck HIRES spectra at z ∼ 5. 5, with the damping wing being observable for ≳ 0. 05 and the deuterium feature observable with additional high-resolution spectra for ≳ 0. 2.

40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can suffer from an error floor when decoded iteratively. This performance degradation is often {{attributed to the}} class of objects known as trapping sets. As {{a subset of the}} trapping set collection, there exists a class of graphical structures called the absorbing sets. An absorbing set is a combinatorially-defined object; in particular a fully absorbing set is stable under bit-flipping decoding. By construction, there can exist trapping sets that are not stable under such a decoder. As a result, for finite-precision, iterative decoding algorithms used over additive channels, absorbing sets can describe decoding errors more accurately than the broader class of trapping sets. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we compute the normalized logarithmic asymptotic distributions of absorbing sets and fully absorbing sets, including elementary (fully) absorbing sets. We compare distributions of absorbing and trapping sets for representative code parameters of interest, and quantify the (lack of) discrepancies between the two. Good absorbing set properties are implied for known structured LDPC codes, including repeat accumulate codes and protograph-based constructions. Establishing the distribution of fully absorbing sets (especially when the discrepancy with the trapping set distribution is significant) allows one to further refine the estimates of the error rates under bit-flipping and related decoders. To reduce implementation complexity, the messages in a practical message passing decoder are necessarily quantized. <b>Absorbing</b> <b>regions</b> act as "decoding regions" around absorbing sets. In the second part of this thesis, we take a closer look at the interplay between quantization and <b>absorbing</b> <b>regions.</b> We provide a study of a range of quantization choices, the impact of quantization on the candidate <b>absorbing</b> <b>regions,</b> and derive guidelines for practical decoders. We show that, due to the non-linear dynamics of message passing decoders, coarser quantization may in fact perform better than finer quantization. Results of this type of work can be particularly useful in designing high performance decoders for very high-reliability storage systems, such as emerging data storage hard disk and solid state drives...|$|R
