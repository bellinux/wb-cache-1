5|$|Chester {{had planned}} to retire in June 2009, and the {{congregation}} embarked on {{a search for a}} new senior rabbi in 2008.

The view that homosexuality was a curable sickness was widely believed in the medical community, general population, and among many lesbians themselves.|$|E

5|$|As Généreux {{pulled away}} to the west, Thompson, who had already been wounded several times, succeeded in turning his {{battered}} ship so that his broadside was directed at the stern of Généreux. Despite the collapsed wreckage of the mizzenmast and fore topmast, his gunnery teams managed to cut away enough of the obstruction to fire a raking broadside at the French vessel. Although Leander had inflicted severe damage, the size {{and power of the}} French ship was beginning to tell, and Lejoille was able to turn Généreux southwards again. The ships continued exchanging broadsides until 15:30, by which time Leanders crew had run out of regular shot and were firing scrap metal at the French ship. Eventually Lejoille succeeded in bringing Généreux across Leanders bow and hailed the British ship, <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> they had surrendered. Unable to continue fighting due to the wreckage that lay across the forward guns, Thompson ordered a French flag raised on a pike, which was sufficient for Lejoille to cease firing.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{decide to}} go to the North Pole to kill Santa, but Brian does not want Stewie to get {{disappointed}} if Santa is not what everybody thinks he is; to this Stewie responds that Brian is as negative as Eeyore from Winnie-the-Pooh. To prevent Stewie from going to the North Pole he tells him that Santa is not real; Stewie questions this, also <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> Elmo, SpongeBob SquarePants and Curious George aren't real. On their way to the North Pole, Brian and Stewie find themselves in Canada, where they meet a man with a thick Canadian accent; they also see the Aurora borealis and the Aurora Boreanaz (an aurora with David Boreanaz's face).|$|E
