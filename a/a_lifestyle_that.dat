5|$|The {{causes of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} {{are not entirely}} clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity. It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot and <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> <b>that</b> involves little exercise. While heel spurs are frequently found it is unclear {{if they have a}} role in causing the condition. Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. As inflammation plays a lesser role, many feel the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms with ultrasound sometimes used to help. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis.|$|E
5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> <b>that</b> is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E
25|$|Some autistic activists {{suggest that}} life with autism {{is very much}} like being born among people who speak a {{different}} language, have a religion or philosophy one does not share and live <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> <b>that</b> feels alien.

25|$|Walden Two, like Thoreau's Walden, champions <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> <b>that</b> {{does not}} support war, or foster {{competition}} and social strife. It encourages a lifestyle of minimal consumption, rich social relationships, personal happiness, satisfying work, and leisure. In 1967, Kat Kinkade and others founded the Twin Oaks Community, using Walden Two as a blueprint. The community still exists and continues to use the Planner-Manager system {{and other aspects of}} the community described in Skinner's book, though behavior modification is not a community practice.|$|E

25|$|Schiaparelli was {{dissatisfied}} by <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> <b>that</b> whilst {{refined and}} comfortable, she considered cloistered and unfulfilling. Her craving for adventure and {{exploration of the}} wider world led to her taking measures to remedy this, and when a friend offered her a post caring for orphaned children in an English country house, she saw an opportunity to leave. The placement however, proved uncongenial to Schiaparelli, who subsequently planned {{a return to the}} stop-over city of Paris rather than admit defeat by returning to Rome and her family.|$|E

500|$|Similarly, Clara Bow's {{speaking}} {{voice was}} sometimes {{blamed for the}} demise of her Hollywood career, though the real issues involved her clashes with studio executives and what film historian David Thomson describes as the [...] "backlash of bourgeois hypocrisy" [...] against <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> <b>that</b> would have been unremarkable for a male star. Buster Keaton was eager to explore the new medium, but when his studio, MGM, made the changeover to sound, he was quickly stripped of creative control. Though a number of Keaton's early talkies made impressive profits, they were artistically dismal.|$|E

500|$|Remains {{of human}} teeth were {{analysed}} {{for evidence of}} arrested development and decay. Arrested development implies periods of nutritional shortage, which could indicate failed harvests. Decay implies either periods of food shortage, or a diet consisting of high proportions of carbohydrate or softer cooked meat, or both. Dental analyses {{showed no sign of}} periods of decay or arrested development, even where there was [...] "considerable wear", indicating <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> <b>that</b> was not dependent on farming cereals. The 1887 bone report notes the [...] "good condition of the teeth".

It portrays a new way of living life and developing relationships which are not normally seen in conventional society. According to a pop-culture expert at the University at Buffalo, Friends is [...] "one of those rare shows that marked a change in American culture."

For three weeks, by day Harrison rehearsed with his tour band, which included Tom Scott, Billy Preston, Jim Horn, Robben Ford, Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark, at the A studio complex on La Brea Avenue, Hollywood. In the evenings, he added vocals and other overdubs to tracks rush-recorded at Friar Park. He had intended to finish [...] "Dark Horse" [...] in this way but decided instead to re-record the track, since the musicians were having to learn the song for inclusion in the concert setlist.|$|E
500|$|Peng resented Mao's {{personal}} lifestyle, which Peng considered decadent and luxurious. By {{the late}} 1950s Mao had developed <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> <b>that</b> {{was out of}} touch with Peng's preference for modesty and simplicity. Mao enjoyed a private pool in Zhongnanhai, and had many villas around China built for him, which he would travel to on a private train. Mao enjoyed the companionship of an ever-changing succession of enthusiastic young women whom he met either on weekly dances in Zhongnanhai or on his journeys by train. Mao had a costly office suite built for him in Beijing, including a private, book-lined study. When Peng's wife suggested the couple spend more free time visiting Mao's quarters, Peng was reluctant, stating that Mao's surroundings were [...] "too luxuriously furnished" [...] for him to tolerate. Throughout the 1950s, Peng continued to refer to the Chairman as [...] "Old Mao", an egalitarian title that was used among senior CCP leaders in the 1930s and 1940s.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2004, Murphy {{married his}} long-time girlfriend, Yvonne McGuinness, an artist {{whom he had}} met in 1996 {{at one of his}} rock band's shows. The couple live in Ireland with their two sons. Murphy often works in or near the city and has {{expressed}} no desire to move to Hollywood. He prefers not to speak about his personal life and did not appear on any live TV chat shows until 2010, when he was a guest on The Late Late Show on Ireland's RTÉ to promote Perrier's Bounty yet still remained reserved. He does not have a stylist or a personal publicist, travels without an entourage, and often attends premieres alone. Reserved and private, Murphy professes a lack of interest in the celebrity scene, finding the red carpet experience [...] "a challenge... and not one I want to overcome". He intentionally practices <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> <b>that</b> will not interest the tabloids: [...] "I haven't created any controversy, I don't sleep around, I don't go and fall down drunk". Murphy is friends with fellow Irish actors Colin Farrell, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Liam Neeson, looking up to the latter like a [...] "surrogate movie dad". But primarily, Murphy's close friendships are those he made before becoming a star.|$|E

500|$|Ralph Waldo Emerson never {{joined the}} Brook Farm community, despite several invitations. He wrote to Ripley on December 15, 1840, of his [...] "conviction that the Community {{is not good}} for me". He also {{questioned}} the idealism of the community, particularly its optimism that all members would equally share responsibility and workload. As he wrote, [...] "The country members naturally were surprised to observe that one man ploughed all day and one looked out of a window all day... and both received at night the same wages". Twenty years later, Emerson publicly denounced the experiment in his collection of essays titled The Conduct of Life. Charles Lane, {{one of the founders of}} another community called Fruitlands, thought the Brook Farmers lived <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> <b>that</b> did not sacrifice enough. As he said, they were [...] "playing away their youth and day-time in a miserably joyous frivolous manner". Like other communities, Brook Farm was criticized for its potential to break up the nuclear family because of its focus on working as a larger community. After its conversion to Fourierism, the Transcendentalists showed less support for the experiment. Henry David Thoreau questioned the community members' idealism and wrote in his journal, [...] "As for these communities, I think I had rather keep bachelor's hall in hell than go to board in heaven". Even Sophia Ripley later questioned their original optimism, referring to it as [...] "childish, empty, & sad".|$|E
500|$|According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} in June 2013 by the All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion (also known as VTsIOM), at least 90 percent of Russians surveyed were in favour of the law. Over 100 conservative groups worldwide signed a petition in support for the law, with Larry Jacobs, manager of the World Congress of Families, supporting its aim to [...] "prohibit advocacy aimed at involving minors in <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> <b>that</b> would imperil their physical and moral health." [...] President of Russia Vladimir Putin answered to early objections to the then-proposed bill in April 2013 by stating that [...] "I want everyone to understand that in Russia there are no infringements on sexual minorities' rights. They're people, just like everyone else, and they enjoy full rights and freedoms". He {{went on to say}} that he fully intended to sign the bill because the Russian people demanded it. As he put it, [...] "Can you imagine an organization promoting pedophilia in Russia? I think people in many Russian regions would have started to take up arms.... The same is true for sexual minorities: I can hardly imagine same-sex marriages being allowed in Chechnya. Can you imagine it? It would have resulted in human casualties." [...] Putin also mentioned that he was concerned about Russia's low birth rate, as same-sex relationships do not produce children. In August 2013, Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko also defended the law, equating it to protecting children from content that glorifies alcohol abuse or drug addiction. He also argued that the controversy over the law and its effects was [...] "invented" [...] by the Western media.|$|E
