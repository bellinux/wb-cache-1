50|$|Webbhelix is a genus of North <b>American</b> <b>land</b> <b>snails,</b> {{terrestrial}} pulmonate gastropod mollusks in {{the family}} Polygyridae. The genus contains several taxa which were previously included under the name Triodopsis multilineata.|$|E
50|$|These are North <b>American</b> <b>land</b> <b>snails.</b> They occur from Alaska, through coastal Canada, and as {{far south}} as {{northern}} Mexico, but they are predominantly snails of the eastern and western United States.|$|E
40|$|Habitats with soil pH, 4 and Ca, 100 ppm, such as pocosins, Sphagnum bogs and heathlands, {{would appear}} inimical to land-snail biodiversity. Nevertheless, {{a survey of}} 1, 356 sites, c. 1 / 2 million {{individuals}} and over 240 species (c. 1 / 5 of the continental fauna) across North America shows that c. 10 % of species appear to favour such highly or moderately acidic sites, spread from subtropical forests of the Gulf of Mexico coast to the arctic tundra. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordina-tion of faunas from 292 sites that support at least five co-occurring species documents that the princi-pal axis of compositional variation in highly and moderately acidic habitats is significantly (P, 0. 0005) correlated with latitude, while the second axis is significantly (P, 0. 0005) correlated with moisture level. Composition was found to vary continuously along both axes, implying that discrete acidophilic communities are not present. While highly and moderately acidic sites were shown to have significantly (P, 0. 000000005) lower richness and abundance compared with neutral/calcar-eous habitats, even the most acidic sites still typically supported 5 – 10 species. Abundance distri-butions in highly acidic habitats {{were found to be}} more uneven those of neutral/calcareous sites. The greater richness of the North American acidophilic land snail fauna compared with that in Europe has allowed communities to display replacement-driven compositional turnover. These results demon-strate that it is vitally important for biodiversity surveys of North <b>American</b> <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> not to ignore acidic habitats, because they harbour an important and surprisingly diverse fauna...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Richness {{and shell}} size {{distributions}} of <b>land</b> <b>snail</b> faunas were analyzed from 838 sites sampled within ten geographic regions spread across a 2300 x 2800 km area in eastern North America, extending from tundra and taiga to tallgrass prairie, mixed boreal-hardwood, deciduous and evergreen subtropical forest. A total of 410, 667 individuals from 166 taxa were encountered. These data documented: (1) Eastern North <b>American</b> <b>land</b> <b>snail</b> communities are frequently marked by {{high levels of}} syntopic species richness. Over 52 % of sites exceeded 12 co-occurring taxa, with almost 10 % supporting more than 24 taxa. Two percent of sites harbored 30 or more taxa. (2) Site richness was inversely related to latitude, with an almost 5 -fold decrease towards the north. (3) Site richness was least in oligotrophic and grassland habitats, and greatest on base-rich bedrock outcrops. (4) Communities are dominated by taxa with maximum shell dimensions of < 5 mm, representing almost 75 % of species and over 80 % of individuals within sites in most regions. Taxa with shells 10 mm or larger never constituted more than 16 % of taxa and 7 % of individuals in average sites. (5) Northern communities harbored a more narrow range of size distributions, with both the largest (10 + mm) and smallest (< 2 mm) size classes becoming less frequent. (6) Medium and large shelled taxa were most frequent in outcrop and lowland forest habitats, while minute species were most frequent in grasslands. (7) The contribution of α and γ diversity to regional richness was greatest in the north, with 41 % of taxa being found on average Churchill, Manitoba sites. However, the contribution of β diversity peaked in the south. These {{results suggest that the}} latitudinal gradient in <b>land</b> <b>snail</b> richness in eastern North America is related not only to {{an increase in the number}} of niches and guilds towards the south, but also to increased niche overlap towards the north...|$|R
40|$|The <b>land</b> <b>snail</b> faunas from 72 upland and lowland {{grassland}} {{sites from}} central North America were analyzed. Sixteen of these {{had been exposed}} to fire management within the last 15 years, while the remainder had not. A total of 91, 074 individuals in 72 different species were observed. Richness was reduced by approximately 30 % on burned sites, while abundance was reduced by 50 - 90 %. One-way ANOVA of all sites (using management type as the independent variable), a full 2 -way ANOVA (using management and grassland type) of all sites, and a 2 -way ANOVA limited to 26 sites paired according to their habitat type and geographic location, demonstrated in all cases a highly significant (up to p < 0. 0005) reduction in richness and abundance on fire managed sites. Contingency table analysis of individual species demonstrated that 44 % experienced a significant reduction in abundance on fire-managed sites. Only six species positively responded to fire. Comparisons of fire response to the general ecological preferences of these species demonstrated that fully 72 % of turf-specialists were negatively impacted by fire, while 67 % of duff-specialists demonstrated no significant response. These differences were highly significant (p = 0. 0006). Thus, frequent use of fire management represents a significant threat to the health and diversity of North <b>American</b> grassland <b>land</b> <b>snail</b> communities. Protecting this fauna will require the preservation of site organic litter layers, which will require the increase of fire return intervals to 15 + years in conjunction with use of more diversified methods to remove woody and invasive plants...|$|R

5000|$|P. manokwari {{has also}} {{sometimes}} been introduced intentionally, as a biological control agent.

It has been said that [...] "much of the 'evidence' that these predators can control Achatina fulica populations is based on a poor understanding of ecological principles. That the predators will prey on African <b>land</b> <b>snail</b> is not evidence that they can control its populations...". The flatworm controlled the population of the Giant African <b>land</b> <b>snail</b> but it also began preying on populations of endemic <b>land</b> <b>snail,</b> which led to an unprecedented increase in the P. manokwari populations and a marked decrease in the endemic <b>land</b> <b>snail</b> populations.|$|R
