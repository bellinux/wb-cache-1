40|$|We measure SKS {{splitting}} {{parameters and}} P and S delay {{times in the}} Mediterranean region using broad-band recordings from the temporary MIDSEA array and permanent networks. The MIDSEA seismic array has substantially improved data coverage along the European-Mediterranean margins and in northern Africa. Shear wave splitting is observed for 95 per cent of the stations, with splitting times up to 2 s. We propose five anisotropic domains, based {{on the characteristics of}} the observations. In {{the western part of the}} region we observe an <b>alignment</b> with <b>plate</b> motion, suggesting an asthenospheric origin for anisotropy. In the central and near eastern part, the fast directions are less coherent laterally and influenced by extension and subduction processes. Along the Dead Sea fault the fast directions are parallel to the relative motion between Arabia and Africa, which we attribute in part to coherent vertical deformation. Our measurements of teleseismic, relative P- and S-wave delay times within the Mediterranean region reach peak-to-peak values of 2. 5 and 8 s, respectively. Consistent with International Seismological Centre (ISC) delay times, we observe the earliest arrivals along the Hellenic subduction zone and some of the latest along the Dead Sea fault. We find that S-wave delays are roughly three times as large as those of P waves. From a slight frequency dependence of our cross-correlation based delay time measurements, we estimate Mediterranean lateral heterogeneity to have a dominant size of one or more hundred kilometres. We further determine that the anisotropy implied by our SKS splitting measurements does not significantly bias the pattern of teleseismic delay time...|$|R

We also introduce a new approach using genetic algorithm to find the location of the plate. Fluctuating illumination conditions are taken care-off by adaptive threshold method. Connected component labelling is used to identify the objects in blind folded regions. A matrix of invariant scale geometry is used for better system adaptability when applied to different plates. The convergence of the genetic algorithm is greatly improved by the introduction of a newly created mutation and crossover operators.

In addition, this kind of system can enable activity monitoring outside the laboratory environment. However, skin surface measurements are prone to errors due to sensor misalignment and skin movement. In this study these two potential errors were being investigated using two electromagnetic tracking sensors. By using a hinged joint to study the effect of sensor misalignment, it was found that a 5 ˚ misalignment produced a measurement error of between 2. 6 ° and 5. 8 °. This error grew when the degree of misalignment increased. In the sensor attachment experiment, two participants were recruited and requested to perform six physiological movements with four different attachment methods. It was observed that insecure sensor attachment would also produce large artefacts (20. 1 ° to 23. 6 ° of coupled motions compared to 3. 3 °/ 3. 9 ° to 5. 8 °/ 5. 7 ° with secured attachment methods during flexion) during spinal motion measurements.

"Thesis supervisor: Dr. Zhihai He. In this work, we develop a license plate detection method using a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier with HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features. The system performs window searching at different scales and analyzes the HOG feature using a SVM and locates their bounding boxes using a Mean Shift method. Edge information is used to accelerate the time consuming scanning process. Our license plate detection results show that this method is relatively insensitive to variations in illumination, license plate patterns, camera perspective and background variations. We tested our method on 200 real life images, captured on Chinese highways under different weather conditions and lighting conditions. And we achieved a detection rate of 100 %. After detecting license <b>plates,</b> <b>alignment</b> is then performed on the plate candidates. Conceptually, this alignment method searches neighbors of the bounding box detected, and finds the optimum edge position where the outside regions {{are very different from}} the inside regions of the license plate, from color's perspective in RGB space. This method accurately aligns the bounding box to the edges of the plate so that the subsequent license plate segmentation and recognition can be performed accurately and reliably. The system performs license plate segmentation using global alignment on the binary license plate. A global model depending on the layout of license plates is proposed to segment the plates. This model searches for the optimum position where the characters are all segmented but not chopped into pieces. At last, the characters are recognized by another SVM classifier, with a feature size of 576, including raw features, vertical and horizontal scanning features. Our character recognition results show that 99 % of the digits are successfully recognized, while the letters achieve an recognition rate of 95 %.

40|$|Cytokinesis {{in plant}} cells {{involves}} {{the formation and}} insertion of a new cell wall that separates daughter nuclei after mitosis. The deposition of the new wall is regulated by a structure called the phragmoplast which contains microtubules, actin filaments and membranes. The experiments described in this thesis, emphasize {{the participation of the}} actin filaments in the cytokinetic process. Caffeine inhibition of cytokinesis shows that two distinct phases cell plate development can be distinguished; an early initiation phase and a late lateral expansion phase. Caffeine completely inhibits the latter stage. I have looked at the dynamics of actin filaments, as well the microtubules, during the inhibition of cytokinesis by caffeine. I found that formation of the cytoskeletal torus, associated with the later stages of cell plate formation, is completely inhibited in the presence of caffeine. The functional role of actin filaments was probed by microinjection of the actin monomer binding protein profilin. The results show a dose-dependent effect on cytokinesis, in which the effects range from delayed cell plate formation to complete inhibition. To asses the localization of profilin, I microinjected a fluorescent profilin probe into living cells and analyzed the localization throughout mitosis. Profilin is accumulated in the nucleus during interphase and prophase and is released in the accessible volume after nuclear envelope break down at the onset of metaphase. It remains in the accessible volume during the subsequent mitotic stages until it re-accumulates in the telophase nuclei. No specific localization of profilin in the phragmoplast was observed. Also, the role of actomyosin in plant cytokinesis was studied by using the myosin ATPase inhibitor, 2, 3 -butanedione monoxime (BDM). Cytokinetic cells, treated with BDM, displayed buckled and thin cell plates that were often tilted at a significant angle. In addition, late lateral cell plate expansion was inhibited and actin filaments in the phragmoplast lost their proper orientation. These results show that actomyosin plays a crucial role in cell <b>plate</b> <b>alignment</b> and late lateral expansion of the cell plate. Finally, a new cell plate formation model is presented that combines some of the results of this thesis with existing models and previous findings. ...|$|R
50|$|The Type 99 is {{a smooth}} bore, muzzle-loading weapon of the Stokes-Brandt type. The Type 99 81 mm mortar {{differs from the}} Type 97 81 mm {{infantry}} mortar in the shortness of its tube, which is only 21.75 inches as compared with 45.34 inches of the Type 97. The mortar can be disassembled into three units: the tube, the bipod, and the base plate. The legs of the bipod, made of tubular steel, are mounted on the elevating screw housing by a clevis joint. They terminate in thin steel plates which have single-pointed spikes on the underside. The spread of the legs is limited by a chain which has a spring attached to one end to relieve the shock of firing. A buffer system incorporated in the bipod gives a recuperation of 2 inches. The recoil cylinders are filled with light grease or heavy oil. The base plate, made of pressed steel, has a series of ribs and braces welded on the underside {{to allow it to}} dig into the ground when the piece is fired. On the top side of the plate, in the center, is a circular depression into which the base-cap knob fits when the mortar is mounted in firing position. A carrying handle is attached to the rear edge of the plate. Also, two small hooks are welded to the rear edge to permit the attachment of a carrying strap. Around {{the outer edge of the}} plate is a one-inch ridge, and on the lower front edge a hook is attached through which a small rod can be thrust and used for slight changes in base <b>plate</b> <b>alignment.</b> A stability test of the Type 99 mortar, in which a total of 14 rounds were fired, produced no visible evidence of cracking or deformation of either base plate or bipod. The plate sank about 2 inches into the ground with the firing of seven rounds at alternate elevations of 45 to 75 degrees. Stability was very satisfactory when firing zone charges I to IV, but zones V to VI produced noticeable hop of the mortar and a sinking of the base plate. The reported range of the weapon of about 2,200 yards has not been conclusively confirmed.|$|R
