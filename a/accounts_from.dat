5|$|Ancient Chinese Buddhist <b>accounts</b> <b>from</b> the mula-sarvastivadin monastic order (or vinaya) present {{yet another}} account of saffron's arrival in India.

Upon his arrival he {{seemingly}} sowed the first Kashmiri saffron crop. From there, saffron use spread throughout the Indian subcontinent. In addition to use in foods, saffron stigmas were also soaked in water to yield a golden-yellow solution that was used as a fabric dye.|$|E

Veltmann pointed out that few of the accused had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning {{that they could not}} all be guilty of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much of the testimony was hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|In 1066, {{the comet}} {{was seen in}} England and thought to be an omen: later that year Harold II of England died at the Battle of Hastings; {{it was a bad}} omen for Harold, but a good omen for the man who {{defeated}} him, William the Conqueror. The comet is represented on the Bayeux Tapestry and described in the tituli as a star. Surviving <b>accounts</b> <b>from</b> the period describe it as appearing to be four times the size of Venus and shining with a light equal to a quarter of that of the Moon. Halley came within 0.10AU of Earth at that time.|$|E

5|$|No {{information}} on the bridge survives from ancient sources. The first descriptions appear in European travellers' <b>accounts</b> <b>from</b> the 19thcentury. The British archaeologist Charles Fellows {{was the first to}} explore the region of Lycia, and visited the bridge in May1840. Fellows, as well as T.A.B. Spratt and Edward Forbes, who visited the site two years later, describe it as having 25 arches. In 1882, an Austrian expedition, including Otto Benndorf, interpreted the structure as part of an ancient road that connected Limyra with the city of Attaleia (modern Antalya) to the east. However, this mission failed to produce any plans or sketches of the site.|$|E
5|$|Ptolemy, {{possibly}} {{drawing on}} earlier {{sources of information}} {{as well as more}} contemporary <b>accounts</b> <b>from</b> the Agricolan invasion, identified 18 tribes in Scotland in his Geography, but many of the names are obscure. His information becomes much less reliable in the north and west, suggesting early Roman knowledge of these area was confined to observations from the sea.

5|$|The {{presence}} of Ahhiyawa in western Anatolia is mentioned in various Hittite <b>accounts</b> <b>from</b> c. 1400 to c. 1220 BC. Ahhiyawa is generally {{accepted as a}} Hittite translation of Mycenaean Greece (Achaeans in Homeric Greek), but a precise geographical {{definition of the term}} cannot be drawn from the texts. During this time, the kings of Ahhiyawa were evidently capable of dealing with their Hittite counterparts both on a diplomatic and military level. Moreover, Ahhiyawan activity was to interfere in Anatolian affairs, with the support of anti-Hittite uprisings or through local vassal rulers, which the Ahhiyawan king used as agents for the extension of his influence.|$|E

5|$|After Fulin came {{to rule on}} his own in 1651, {{his mother}} the Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang {{arranged}} for him to marry her niece, but the young monarch deposed his new Empress in 1653. The following year Xiaozhuang arranged another imperial marriage with her Khorchin Mongol clan, this time matching her son with her own grand-niece. Though Fulin also disliked his second empress (known posthumously as Empress Xiaohuizhang), he {{was not allowed to}} demote her. She never bore him children. Starting in 1656, the Shunzhi Emperor lavished his affection on Consort Donggo, who, according to Jesuit <b>accounts</b> <b>from</b> the time, had first been the wife of another Manchu noble. She gave birth to a son (the Shunzhi Emperor's fourth) in November 1657. The emperor would have made him his heir apparent, but he died early in 1658 before he was given a name.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Hawaiian {{religious}} practice {{holds that the}} five volcanic peaks of the island are sacred, and regards Mauna Loa, the largest of them all, with great admiration; but what mythology survives today consists mainly of oral <b>accounts</b> <b>from</b> the 18th century first compiled in the 19th. Most of these stories agree that the Hawaiian volcano deity, Pele, resides in Halemaʻumaʻu Crater on Kilauea; however a few place her home at Mauna Loa's summit caldera Mokuʻāweoweo, and the mythos in general associates her with all volcanic activity on the island. Regardless, Kīlauea's lack of a geographic outline and strong volcanic link to Mauna Loa led to it being considered an offshoot of Mauna Loa by the Ancient Hawaiians, meaning much of the mythos now associated with Kīlauea was originally directed at Mauna Loa proper as well.|$|E
5|$|Arab <b>accounts</b> <b>from</b> the 10th century place al-Battal {{alongside}} Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik {{during the}} latter's unsuccessful siege of Constantinople in 717–718, {{but as the}} Arab accounts of the siege are semi-legendary, {{it is impossible to}} know if this report contains any truth. In reliable historical sources (the chroniclers al-Ya'qubi and al-Tabari), al-Battal first appears in 727, in one of the annual raids against Byzantine Asia Minor. This campaign was commanded by Mu'awiya ibn Hisham, the son of the reigning Caliph Hisham (reigned 723–743). Al-Battal led the vanguard, with which he penetrated as far as the city of Gangra in Paphlagonia, which he captured and razed, before the army went on to unsuccessfully lay siege to Nicaea. Blankinship considers that al-Battal's capture of Gangra ranks as one of the greatest successes of Umayyad arms against the Byzantines in this period, along with the capture of Caesarea by Maslama in 726.|$|E

5|$|Byron took Giraud {{to visit}} Charles Lewis Meryon, an English doctor who recounted the visit {{in his memoirs}} and noted Byron's vivid {{interest}} in the boy. Afterward, rumours were spread by Byron's servant that the consultation concerned an anal rupture. Meryon was a travelling companion with Michael Bruce and Lady Hester Stanhope, one of Byron's friends. <b>Accounts</b> <b>from</b> Bruce and Howe Browne, both witnesses to Byron's interactions with Giraud, provided confirmation of the relationship to Byron's early biographer Thomas Moore, although in disparaging terms. In mid-1810, Giraud acted as Byron's majordomo on their travels to the Peloponnese, {{and took care of}} Byron during his illness while at Patras, eventually becoming ill himself. After recovering, although still weak, the pair continued on their travels, arriving at Athens on 13October. By November they were joined by Lusieri, Louis François Sébastien Fauvel, who was a French consul, and a group of German academics.|$|E
5|$|Casualties {{were heavy}} on both sides, and both vessels were in such poor {{condition}} that each commander {{thought he had}} sunk his opponent. Most of La Vengeance rigging had been blown away; only the lower foremast, lower mizzenmast, and bowsprit were operational. Pitot set course for Curaçao {{and was forced to}} ground his vessel there to prevent her from sinking. The number of French casualties is somewhat unclear: official French accounts report 28 dead and 40 wounded, while <b>accounts</b> <b>from</b> Curaçao state that the French frigate had lost 160 men. Once Pitot reached Curaçao he was beset with further problems. La Vengeance remained out of action for months due to difficulties in acquiring support needed to repair the frigate from the Dutch officials there. A French expedition to seize the island brought the materiel needed to repair the frigate, but when asked to help attack the island Pitot refused and slipped away to Guadaloupe.|$|E
5|$|Godwin had {{a lifelong}} {{interest}} {{in language and}} communication (as is evident in Gonsales's various means of communicating with his servant Diego on St Helena), {{and this was the}} topic of his Nuncius inanimatus (1629). The language Gonsales encounters on the Moon bears no relation to any he is familiar with, and it takes him months to acquire sufficient fluency to communicate properly with the inhabitants. While its vocabulary appears limited, its possibilities for meaning are multiplied since the meaning of words and phrases also depends on tone. Invented languages were an important element of earlier fantastical accounts such as Thomas More's Utopia, François Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel and Joseph Hall's Mundus Alter et Idem, all books that Godwin was familiar with. P. Cornelius, in a study of invented languages in imaginary travel <b>accounts</b> <b>from</b> the 17th and 18th centuries, proposes that a perfect, rationally organised language is indicative of the Enlightenment's rationalism. As H. Neville Davies argues, Godwin's imaginary language is more perfect than for instance More's in one aspect: it is spoken on the entire Moon and has not suffered from the Earthly dispersion of languages caused by the fall of the Tower of Babel.|$|E
