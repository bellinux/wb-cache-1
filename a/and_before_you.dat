500|$|In an {{interview}} with MistaJam, Tempah cites Dizzee Rascal and So Solid Crew as influences for the album, who've influenced him since his childhood. He also told Capital that Daft Punk influenced the album. Speaking about the album title Demonstration, Tinie {{said that it was}} about him compromising to make an album that was both true to where he came from and follows the trappings of mainstream hip hop: [...] "Anyone who wants to take inspiration from it can have a sort of example based on my experiences of how to do this. So basically, do something that still nods to where you've come from, still feels very London, still feels very British, but kind of meets the criteria of what a mainstream record needs." [...] He also commented oh how things change when signing with a record label and how the process of making albums: [...] "The first time around, you don't really know. All you do is you get this record deal and you're like whoa! Like, I'm signed! This is amazing! And you're just recording <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> know it the album's done. This time around, I had to think about so much more things, you know: edits, production things that I didn't like, going back and forth on mixing.... I was very hands-on this time." ...|$|E
500|$|The track [...] "Receptacle For the Respectable" [...] {{reflects}} the eclecticism {{of the album}} as it [...] "undergoes a complete personality change" [...] {{over the course of}} its four-minute thirty-two-second duration, veering from prog rock to death metal. The song begins as an acoustic guitar-driven pop song and then shifts into a slower bridge section which leads to an even slower coda which has been compared to the music of Burt Bacharach and The Beach Boys' Smiley Smile album and features Paul McCartney chewing carrots and celery to the beat. The track ends with a [...] "pantomime death metal" [...] section with Rhys's [...] "distorted, bellowed vocals" [...] screaming the title phrase. According to Cian Ciaran, the song initially comprised just the first two parts when recorded at Monnow Valley Studios but, by the time the group relocated to Bearsville Studios, Rhys had written and added the third section. While there the band added the fourth section by [...] "pissing about with Pro Tools", looping the bass {{from the end of the}} third section [...] "by accident" [...] to create the musical backing. A fifth, hip hop, section was discussed but the band decided against it, reasoning that [...] "if you're going to do a fifth bit, you'd probably do a sixth, <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> know where you are, you're doing a concept album made up of nothing but bits!". According to the band, the track is the only time on the album where they tried to achieve comedy and [...] "completely went with [...] silly streak".|$|E

2500|$|Ben Patashnik of Rock Sound {{awarded the}} album {{a score of}} eight out of ten. He did note the [...] "varnished" [...] production, making it [...] "hard {{to fall in love}} with until {{repeated}} listens unleash its true charms." [...] However, he also added, [...] "‘Coffee And Cigarettes’ and the title track slowly uncurl themselves over the course of a few days <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> know it, it feels like Jimmy Eat World never went away." [...] Sputnikmusic staff writer Mike Stagno awarded the album a [...] "great" [...] 3½ out of five grading. He explained that, [...] "Invented reins in Jimmy Eat World after Chase This Light. It still possesses the same inviting, feel-good sentiment, but it's expressed more personably, and in this regard it makes for a very rewarding listen." [...] British rock magazine Kerrang! awarded an [...] "excellent" [...] four K! score and opined, [...] "Invented is a return to the creative peaks of yore. It's a record rich with twinkling sonic subtleties, timeless melodies and characteristically layered, epic tunes." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 1, 2011 Jakob Dylan {{announced}} that the Wallflowers would be reuniting to release an album, explaining: [...] "I never suggested we were breaking up. [...] We all felt we were losing the plot a bit and we needed a break. [...] And that year break becomes two years, then becomes three years, <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> know it {{five or six years}} go by pretty quickly. [...] I can't do what I do in the Wallflowers without them. [...] I miss it." [...] In an interview with the St. Joseph News-Press, Dylan stated that the Wallflowers would be getting into the studio in January and the lineup would include Greg Richling on bass, Rami Jaffee on keys, Stuart Mathis on guitar and Fred Eltringham on drums. [...] However, weeks before the Wallflowers began recording, Eltringham left the band to pursue other projects. [...] The band quickly got former Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons to join the band. [...] Irons was previously involved in a side project with Wallflowers bassist Richling.|$|E
