5|$|A cheap, {{cost-effective}} {{and practical}} alternative in poorer countries is visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Instituting and sustaining cytology-based programs {{in these regions}} can be difficult, due {{to the need for}} trained personnel, equipment and facilities <b>and</b> <b>difficulties</b> in follow-up. With VIA, results and treatment can be available on the same day. As a screening test, VIA is comparable to cervical cytology in accurately identifying precancerous lesions.|$|E
5|$|According to Ito, the Super Famicom {{release was}} a great success for the company, helping {{establishing}} it as both a developer and publisher.

At the end of 2001, the PlayStation version was the 119th best selling video {{game of the year}} in Japan, with 85,991 sold copies.|$|E

He eventually sought, and achieved, a reconciliation with Kronecker. Nevertheless, the philosophical disagreements <b>and</b> <b>difficulties</b> dividing them persisted.|$|E

5|$|The {{measured}} {{density of}} iridium {{is only slightly}} lower (by about 0.12%) than that of osmium, the densest element known.

5|$|Along with Annie Smith Peck, Workman was {{recognized}} {{during the early}} 20th century {{as one of the}} most famous female climbers in the world. Their rivalry demonstrated that women could climb the most remote and difficult terrain on the planet. Women had climbed regularly in the Alps since the 1850s, but in the Himalayas, mountaineering had been dominated by wealthy English men. No other women, however, climbed in the Himalaya until well after World War I, by which time improvements in equipment and organization had shifted that nature of risks <b>and</b> <b>difficulties</b> of expeditions.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} adult {{remains in the}} nest {{for two to three}} weeks after {{hatching}} to protect the young. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating onto the floor of the nest. Black stork parents have been known to kill one of their fledglings, generally the weakest, in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. This behaviour has only rarely been observed in the species, although the shyness of the species <b>and</b> <b>difficulties</b> in studying its nesting habits mean that it might not be an uncommon phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Deceptive {{markings}} on helicopters further complicated matters for NATO pilots. Many of the combatants painted their helicopters {{to look like}} those of organizations that the UN's Zagreb Flight Coordination Center had authorized to fly in restricted space. For example, {{the army of the}} Republika Srpska often painted a Red Cross logo on their helicopters, and Croatian helicopters were given markings similar to those of UN humanitarian aid helicopters. The questionable identity of these helicopters became particularly problematic after the Black Hawk Incident in Iraq, because NATO pilots became more reluctant to engage potential belligerents without clear identification. As a result of the rules of engagement <b>and</b> <b>difficulties</b> in aircraft identification, NATO forces proved unable to stop most unauthorized helicopter flights, resulting in a documented total of 5711 unauthorized flights during the conflict.|$|E

5|$|Despite the boasting of Mussolini and {{the fury}} of Churchill, the loss of Tug Argan and {{consequently}} Somaliland was not of the greatest strategic importance. Certainly it was a blow to British prestige and pride, but Somaliland was one of Britain's lesser regions of value and could be affordably lost. In fact, Britain incurred monetary gains after being relieved of the necessity to station an expensive garrison there. But the impact could have been far greater if the Italians had managed to move faster after the battle. Heavy rains <b>and</b> <b>difficulties</b> supplying the troops damaged these efforts, as well as removed any chance of a sizable strategic victory.|$|E
5|$|Following the Reformation gains (the Warsaw Confederation of 1573 was the {{culmination}} of the unique in Europe religious toleration processes), the Catholic Church embarked on an ideological counter-offensive and Counter-Reformation claimed many converts from Protestant circles. Disagreements over <b>and</b> <b>difficulties</b> with the assimilation of the eastern Ruthenian populations of the Commonwealth had become clearly discernible. At an earlier stage (from the late 16th century), they manifested themselves in the religious Union of Brest, which split the Eastern Christians of the Commonwealth, and on the military front, in a series of Cossack uprisings.|$|E

5|$|The {{failure of}} Operation Eagle Claw during the Iran hostage crisis in 1980 underscored the {{requirement}} for a new long-range, high-speed, vertical-takeoff aircraft for the United States Department of Defense. In response, the Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) aircraft program started in 1981. A partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft. The Bell Boeing team jointly produce the aircraft. The V-22 first flew in 1989, and began flight testing and design alterations; the complexity <b>and</b> <b>difficulties</b> {{of being the first}} tiltrotor for military service led to many years of development.|$|E

The film had also begun to surpass its budget, due to the casual nature of shooting <b>and</b> <b>difficulties</b> in creating historical sets. The first shots from the film and the video for three songs were unveiled publicly in March2011, with the publicity campaign initiated after this.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, Sorabji ceased composing, {{because of}} his failing {{eyesight}} <b>and</b> <b>difficulties</b> in holding a pen. His health deteriorated severely in 1986, obliging him to abandon his home and spend several months in a Wareham hospital. In March 1987, together with his companion Reginald Norman Best (1909–1988), he moved into a two-room suite in Marley House Nursing Home, a private nursing home in Winfrith Newburgh, where he was permanently chairbound and received daily nursing care. In June 1988 he suffered a mild stroke, which left him slightly mentally impaired. He died of heart failure on 15 October 1988 at a little after 7pm, at the age of 96. He was cremated in Bournemouth Crematorium on 24 October of that year, and the funeral services took place in Corfe Castle Parish Church on the same day.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 7 October the allied {{artillery}} and mortar bombardment began, targeting Chinese positions on the Hinge. Hassett moved the 3 RAR tactical headquarters on to Hill 317 just before the assaulting troops stepped off the line of departure, allowing him to direct the battle from a forward position and to co-ordinate fire support. Waiting for the fog to lift so that the artillery could fire until the last safe moment, the attack finally began at 08:00. B Company moved off down the ridgeline, with two-up and one-in-depth, using the trees and long grass for concealment. Initially it seemed that the Chinese had withdrawn during the night, when suddenly the lead Australian platoons were engulfed by small arms fire from their rear. A series of intense fire-fights ensued as the Australians fought back and by 09:20 the Hinge finally fell, with the Australians losing two killed and 20 wounded. Chinese casualties included more than 20 killed. As a result of the fighting Captain Henry Nicholls and Lieutenant Jim Hughes were awarded the Military Cross, while Corporal J. Park and Corporal E.F. Bosworth were awarded the Military Medal. Yet even as the surviving Chinese withdrew, artillery and mortar fire began to fall on the Hinge. B Company moved quickly to consolidate the position, but were hampered by the shelling, while they now faced a pressing shortage of ammunition <b>and</b> <b>difficulties</b> evacuating their casualties.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Perry portrays Chandler Bing, an {{executive}} in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large, multinational corporation. Chandler hates this job, although it pays well. He attempts to quit during season one, but is lured {{back with a}} new office and a pay raise. He eventually quits this job in season nine due to a transfer to Tulsa. He becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency later that season. Chandler has a peculiar family history being {{the son of an}} erotic novelist mother and a gay, cross-dressing Las Vegas star father. Chandler is known for his sarcastic sense of humor and bad luck in relationships. Chandler marries Monica in season seven, and they adopt twins {{at the end of the}} series. Before his relationship with Monica, Chandler dated Janice Hosenstein in season one and subsequently broke up with her many times. Matthew Perry has expressed his similarities to the character, such as his need to break an awkward silence with a joke <b>and</b> <b>difficulties</b> with women when first joining the show.|$|E
5|$|The QF 25-pounder Short {{received}} a mixed reception from gunners, and was particularly unpopular {{among members of}} AIF artillery units which had used the standard 25-pounder during the fighting in the Middle East. Guns were sometimes put out of action by damage caused by the absorption of violent recoil. The gun also {{had a tendency to}} tilt at low elevation; this was remedied by its crew standing on the trails, an expedient that had previously been used with the QF 4.5 inch Howitzer. Other limitations included a low rate of fire (three or four rounds per minute) <b>and</b> <b>difficulties</b> towing the weapon. Concerns were also raised over the quality of workmanship, and the commander of the 2/4th Field Regiment rejected a batch of Short 25-pounders sent to his unit before the Nadzab operation in the belief that they had been poorly manufactured. Inspectors subsequently concluded that most of his criticisms were unfounded, however. The most important deficiency compared to the regular 25-pounder was the shorter range. As a result of its experience with the gun, the 9th Division recommended that they be pooled and reserved for their special role rather than be employed in a day-to-day role alongside the regular 25 pounder.|$|E
