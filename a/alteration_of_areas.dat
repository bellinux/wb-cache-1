Formation of new States and <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas,</b> {{boundaries}} or names of existing States. Parliament may by law—:(a) form a new State by separation of territory from any State or by uniting two or more States or parts of States or by uniting any territory to a part of any State;:(b) increase the area of any State;:(c) diminish the area of any State;:(d) alter the boundaries of any State;:(e) alter the name of any State:Provided that no Bill for the purpose shall be introduced in either House of Parliament except {{on the recommendation of}} the President and unless, where the proposal contained in the Bill affects the boundaries of any State or States specified in Part A or Part B of the First Schedule or the name or names of any such State or States, the views of the Legislature of the State or, as the case may be, of each of the States both with respect to the proposal to introduce the Bill and with respect to the provisions thereof have been ascertained by the President.|$|E
50|$|Under the proviso to Article 3 of the Constitution (relating to {{formation}} of new States and <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas,</b> boundaries or names of existing States), no {{bill for the}} purpose of forming a new state, increasing or decreasing the area of any state or altering the boundaries or name of any state could be introduced in Parliament, unless the views of the State Legislatures concerned with respect to the provisions of the bill had been ascertained by the President. It was considered desirable that when a reference was made to the State Legislatures for the said purpose, the President should be able to prescribe the period within which the states should convey their views, and it should be open to the President to extend such period whenever he considered it necessary. It was also considered desirable to provide that the bill would not be introduced until after the expiry of such period. The 5th Amendment sought to amend the proviso to Article 3 of the Constitution accordingly.The Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Bill, 1955 (Bill No. 60 of 1955) was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 21 November 1955. It was introduced by C.C. Biswas, then Minister of Law and Minority Affairs, and sought to amend Articles 3, 100, 101, 103, 148, 189, 190, 192, 276, 297, 311, 316 and 319 of the Constitution. However, the bill could not be taken up for consideration by the House and lapsed on the dissolution of the First Lok Sabha. The government decided to introduce a separate bill to expedite consideration and passing of the amendment to article 3, because it felt that the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Bill would take a very long time to be disposed of, as it sought to amend several articles. In order to achieve this, the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Bill, 1955 (Bill No. 63 of 1955) which sought to amend article 3, was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 28 November 1955, by C.C. Biswas. Clause 2 of this Bill, which sought to amend article 3, was exactly similar to the corresponding clause of the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Bill, 1955. A motion to refer the Seventh Amendment Bill to the a Select Committee was moved on 30 November 1955. However, this motion failed to obtain the support of a special majority as required by the Rules of Procedure of the House.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} constitution {{provided for}} {{three categories of}} amendments. The first category of amendments are those contemplated in articles 4 (2), 169 (3) -1962, 239A (2) -1962, 239AA (7b) -1991, 243M (4b) -1992, 243ZC (3) -1992, 244A (4) -1969, 356 (1)c, para 7(2) of Schedule V and para 21(2) of Schedule VI. These amendments can be effected by Parliament by a simple majority such as that required for the passing of any ordinary law. The amendments under this category are specifically excluded from the purview of article 368 which is the specific provision in the Constitution dealing with {{the power and the}} procedure for the amendment of the Constitution. Article 4 provides that laws made by Parliament under article 2 (relating to admission or establishment of new States) and article 3 (relating to formation of new States and <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas,</b> boundaries or names of existing States) effecting amendments in the First Schedule or the Fourth Schedule and supplemental, incidental and consequential matters, shall not be deemed to be amendments of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. For example, the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, which brought about reorganisation of the States in India, was passed by Parliament as an ordinary piece of legislation. In Mangal Singh v. Union of India (A.I.R. 1967 S.C. 944), the Supreme Court held that power to reduce the total number of members of Legislative Assembly below the minimum prescribed under article 170 (1) is implicit in the authority to make laws under article 4. Article 169 empowers Parliament to provide by law for the abolition or creation of the Legislative Councils in States and specifies that though such law shall contain such provisions for the amendment of the Constitution as may be necessary, it shall not be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. The Legislative Councils Act, 1957, which provided {{for the creation of a}} Legislative Council in Andhra Pradesh and for increasing the strength of the Legislative Councils in certain other States, is an example of a law passed by Parliament in exercise of its powers under article 169. The Fifth Schedule contains provisions as to the administration and control of the Schedule Areas and Scheduled Tribes. Para 7 of the Schedule vests Parliament with plenary powers to enact laws amending the Schedule and lays down that no such law shall be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. Under Para 21 of the Sixth Schedule, Parliament has full power to enact laws amending the Sixth Schedule which contains provisions for the administration of Tribal Areas in the States of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. No such law, will be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368.|$|E

40|$|A Geographical Information System (GIs) -supported {{method was}} {{developed}} for predicting the spatial distri- bution of soil wetness as an indicator to determine the probability of an area {{to act as a}} groundwater recharge or discharge area. The method was based on overlays of maps with the distribution of hydrological determining factors. An application was made for the river basin (south-central Sweden). Changes in the soil-wetnessmosaic due to human activities were also analyzed. Since the 1870 s drainage and forestry had, according to the analysis, decreased by 5 % the parts of the basin that act as discharge areas during wet spells. In the agriculturally dominated sub-basins, the alterations were larger. Forty percent of the open land had been artificially drained. The main shift of soil wetness index classes was caused by an <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> that earlier fluctuated between groundwater discharge and recharge into typical recharge areas. For the plains, the shift from discharge areas to recharge areas was also significant. A conceptual water partitioning model was used to assess the spatial distribution of water flows (evaporation and recharge), as a response to climatic inputs, for areas with different physiographic and vegetative characteristics. The present water flow pattern was compared with the response mosaic of the 1870 s. The increased maximum daily recharge peaks during autumn constitute the only significant change in the hydrological response for the studied area as a whole. The consequencesthat the desiccation of the landscape have on chemical and biological processes were discussed...|$|E
40|$|Project Summary: A {{conceptual}} model is proposed that describes how ecosystem services of tidal marshes vary along the salinity gradient and how climate change will alter {{the delivery of}} ecosystem services. Accelerated sea level rise is predicted to reduce the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> tidal marsh via submergence and conversion of tidal freshwater marsh to brackish & salt marsh. The result will be a reduction in ecosystem services of salt and brackish marshes along with an almost complete loss of services provided by tidal freshwater marshes. Predicted greater inter-annual variability of climate will lead to greater frequency of drought that reduces delivery of ecosystem services and freshwater pulsing which we predict will enhance delivery of ecosystem services.

Normal high contractility was characteristic of the models from the cells preincubated with PMA in combination with Colcemid. PMA is a specific activator of protein kinase C, one of the key enzymes of the membrane signal-transduction pathway.

40|$|AIMS: We {{determined}} {{the contribution of}} the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein- 2 to cell-cell cohesion in cardiomyocytes. In the intercalated disc, providing mechanical strength and electrical communication between adjacent cardiomyocytes, desmoglein- 2 is closely associated with N-cadherin and gap junctions. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied intercalated discs of HL- 1 cardiomyocytes by immunostaining of desmoglein- 2 and N-cadherin. Cohesion was measured using a liberase-based dissociation-assay and compared with cell-free single-molecule atomic force microscopy measurements. L-tryptophan caused irregular desmoglein- 2 condensation, weakened cell-cell cohesion and impaired both homophilic desmoglein- 2 and N-cadherin trans-interaction, whereas l-phenylalanine had no effect. L-tryptophan did not affect N-cadherin localization and its inhibitory effect on cell-cohesion and desmoglein- 2 binding, but not on N-cadherin interaction, was blocked by a desmoglein-specific tandem peptide. Moreover, Ca(2 +) -depletion, desmoglein- 2 knockdown, a desmoglein-specific single peptide and certain desmoglein- 2 mutations associated with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy reduced cell-cell cohesion, whereas cell adhesion was strengthened by desmoglein- 2 overexpression. Since single peptide did not interfere with N-cadherin trans-interaction, these data indicate that (i) desmoglein- 2 binding is crucial for cardiomyocyte cohesion and (ii) L-tryptophan reduced both desmoglein- 2 and N-cadherin binding, whereas single and tandem peptide can be used to specifically target desmoglein- 2 -mediated adhesion. L-tryptophan and single peptide also induced ultrastructural <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> <b>areae</b> compositae. Functional analyses at the organ level revealed reduced cardiomyocyte function and inefficient response to adrenergic stimulation in both L-tryptophan- and single peptide-challenged murine Langendorff hearts paralleled by redistribution of connexin 43 in L-tryptophan-treated heart slices.

The nonspecific probe substrate 4 -methylumbelliferone (4 -MU) and recombinant UGT enzymes (UGT 1 A 9, UGT 2 B 7) were firstly used to evaluate the inhibition of arbidol towards UGT 1 A 9 and UGT 2 B 7. Furthermore, specific substrates of UGT 1 A 9 and UGT 2 B 7 propofol and zidovudine (AZT) were used to determine the inhibition of arbidol towards UGT 1 A 9 and UGT 2 B 7. Inhibition type and inhibition kinetic parameters (K-i) were determined. In vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IV-IVE) was performed to predict in vivo DDI magnitude induced by arbidol. Arbidol was demonstrated to exhibit competitive inhibition towards UGT 1 A 9 and UGT 2 B 7 without substate-dependent behaviour.

40|$|Riparian {{zones are}} {{important}} contributors to stream ecosystem health. <b>Alteration</b> <b>of</b> such <b>areas</b> can change stream structure and function, resulting in modified productivity and hydrologic patterns. We studied two riffle {{sites on the}} South Fork of the Spring River in Fulton County, AR upstream and downstream of a streambank ostensibly degraded by unrestricted cattle access. The two sites were measured for differences in physical habitat (including bank width, stream velocity, depth, substrate composition, and embeddedness), chemical characteristics (including dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, turbidity and total suspended solids) and biological characteristics (including benthic macroinvertebrate community composition, similarity, and standing crop). Measurements were conducted quarterly for one year. We found embeddedness, total suspended solids and turbidity to be significantly higher downstream of the cattle access area. Community metrics were similar for both sites; however, macroinvertebrate standing crop was lower downstream. These results suggest moderate differences in stream productivity downstream of the cattle access site. Future work will evaluate whether reduced cattle access and streambank stabilization efforts result in improvements in water quality and density of macroinvertebrates...|$|R
50|$|The Sandown Old Meetinghouse {{is located}} on a hill above the modern village center of the town, {{on the east side}} of Fremont Street. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its clapboards are original, {{fastened}} to the structure by wrought iron nails. The roof eave is modillioned, with returns on the gabled ends. The building is roughly square, with five-bay facades on each side. There are entrances on the east, south, and west sides, all framed by pilasters and topped by fully pedimented gables. The east and west entrances are slightly off enter, and have four-light transom windows. The interior of the building is virtually unaltered, retaining its 18th-century pulpit and sounding board, as well as its original box pews. Alterations include the addition of wood stoves in the 19th century, and the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> one <b>area</b> in the gallery to accommodate a choir and organ. The gallery railings originally had spindled balustrades, but most of the spindles have been lost.|$|R
