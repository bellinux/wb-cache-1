5|$|After {{examining}} {{the practice of}} other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire firebox. The drive would be divided between the front coupled axle for the inside cylinders and the middle coupled axle for the outside cylinders giving better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow. The new design was an inevitable compromise between {{the need for additional}} power <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> weight down to an acceptable limit.|$|E
5|$|Dominican {{folk music}} is an oral tradition, learned informally through {{watching}} others perform. As of 1987, most performers of traditional music were either over 50 {{years old or}} under 35, which indicates an ongoing revival of previously declining traditions. Music is evaluated based on both characteristics of the music, such as complex syncopated rhythms, {{as well as social}} factors, such as the ability of the performers to improvise and respond to their surroundings <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> audience excited and participating in the music.|$|E

5|$|By 301, {{however, the}} system was in trouble, {{strained}} by a new bout of inflation. Diocletian therefore issued his Edict on Coinage, an act re-tariffing all debts so that the nummus, the most common coin in circulation, would be worth half as much. In the edict, preserved in an inscription {{from the city of}} Aphrodisias in Caria (near Geyre, Turkey), it was declared that all debts contracted before 1 September 301 must be repaid at the old standards, while all debts contracted after that date would be repaid at the new standards. It appears that the edict was made in an attempt to preserve the current price of gold <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> Empire's coinage on silver, Rome's traditional metal currency. This edict risked giving further momentum to inflationary trends, as had happened after Aurelian's currency reforms. The government's response was to issue a price freeze.|$|E
5|$|Funds were {{scarce in}} the 1760s {{but a number}} of {{improvements}} were made to the North Front defences and the sea wall from South Bastion to Europa Point, which was severely damaged by a great storm in 1766. Green spent several years reviewing the state of the fortifications and developing a plan to improve them. He sent a report to the Board of Ordnance in London in 1762 and another in 1768. The following year he travelled to London to present his conclusions to a commission appointed by William Pitt the Elder. He summed up his three principal aims as being to prevent a possible landing by sea; {{to improve the quality of}} the garrison and its provisioning; <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> enemy at a distance with artillery.|$|E
5|$|Hip hop is a {{cultural}} movement, of which music is a part. Hip hop music {{for the most part}} is itself composed of two parts: rapping, the delivery of swift, highly rhythmic and lyrical vocals; and DJing and/or producing, the production of instrumentation through sampling, instrumentation, turntablism, or beatboxing, the production of musical sounds through vocalized tones. Hip hop arose in the early 1970s in The Bronx, New York City. Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc is widely regarded as the progenitor of hip hop; he brought with him from Jamaica the practice of toasting over the rhythms of popular songs. Emcees originally arose to introduce the soul, funk, and R songs that the DJs played, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> crowd excited and dancing; over time, the DJs began isolating the percussion break of songs (when the rhythm climaxes), producing a repeated beat that the emcees rapped over.|$|E

Seamans then directed establishment of the Apollo 204 Review Board chaired by Langley Research Center director Floyd L. Thompson, which included astronaut Frank Borman, spacecraft designer Maxime Faget, and six others. On February 1, Cornell University professor Frank A. Long left the board, {{and was replaced by}} Dr. Robert W. Van Dolah, of the U.S. Bureau of Mines. The next day, North American's Chief engineer for Apollo, George Jeffs, also left.|$|E
5|$|Storage can be {{short-term}} or long-term. Most {{vegetables are}} perishable and short-term storage {{for a few}} days provides flexibility in marketing. During storage, leafy vegetables lose moisture, and the vitamin C in them degrades rapidly. A few products such as potatoes and onions have better keeping qualities and can be sold when higher prices may be available, and by extending the marketing season, a greater total volume of crop can be sold. If refrigerated storage is not available, the priority for most crops is to store high-quality produce, to maintain a high humidity level, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> produce in the shade.|$|E
5|$|Alexei Stukov was {{the vice}} admiral and second-in-command of the United Earth Directorate's expeditionary force. He first appears in Brood War, voiced by CÃ¡stulo Guerra; he later reappears {{as one of}} Kerrigan's lieutenants in the Zerg Swarm in Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void, voiced by Victor Brandt. A man of Russian descent, his {{military}} career primarily revolves around secret research, though he is also noted as an excellent tactician. A close friend of DuGalle, Stukov will debate situations with the admiral but will subordinate himself to his friend's higher rank. Stukov becomes suspicious of the motives of Samir Duran after the latter convinces DuGalle to destroy the psi disruptor. Believing the device to be the UED's best hope to conquer the Zerg, Stukov instead takes the psi disruptor to Braxis but is tracked down and shot dead by Duran. With his dying breaths, Stukov convinces DuGalle that Duran is a traitor <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> psi disruptor running for the UED's assault on the Zerg homeworld of Char. Stukov's body is given a full funeral and UED propaganda portrays Stukov as a hero, claiming he died in combat on Char.|$|E

5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to retelling the plot from Metroid, Metroid: Zero Mission introduces new cinematics {{to push the}} story forward. Sakamoto believed {{in the importance of}} having a story to complement a game. He found it particularly difficult to convey the game's plot accurately {{in a way that the}} player can understand, because of the sparse use of dialogue in the Metroid series. The story for Metroid: Zero Mission was rewritten to explore Samus Aran's backstory more than in the original Metroid. Cinematics are used to show Samus' memories to move the story forward <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> plot open for interpretation. Sakamoto claimed that this was intended to expand the original story while retaining some mystery. The game is the first Metroid game to let the player choose a difficulty level at the start of the game; each of three levels varies in the amount of damage caused by enemies. The battle with Mother Brain marked the end of the original Metroid; however, Metroid: Zero Mission offers players extra levels to play after the battle.|$|E
5|$|The overall Persian {{strategy}} for the invasion of 480 BC was to overwhelm the Greeks with a massive invasion force, and complete the conquest of Greece in a single campaigning season. Conversely, the Greeks sought {{to make the best}} use of their numbers by defending restricted locations <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> Persians in the field for as long as possible. Xerxes had obviously not anticipated such resistance, or he would have arrived earlier in the campaigning season (and not waited 4 days at Thermopylae for the Greeks to disperse). Time was now of the essence for the Persians â the huge invasion force could not be reasonably supported indefinitely, nor probably did Xerxes wish to be at the fringe of his empire for so long. Thermopylae had shown that a frontal assault against a well defended Greek position was useless; with the Allies now dug in across the narrow Isthmus, there was little chance of conquering the rest of Greece by land. However, as equally demonstrated by Thermopylae, if the Greeks could be outflanked, their smaller numbers of troops could be destroyed. Such an outflanking of the Isthmus required the use of the Persian navy, and thus the destruction of the Allied navy. Therefore, if Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy, he would be in a strong position to force a Greek surrender; this seemed the only hope of concluding the campaign in that season. Conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by crippling the Persian fleet, the Greeks could effectively thwart the invasion.|$|E
