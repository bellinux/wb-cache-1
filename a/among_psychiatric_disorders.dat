40|$|Past {{studies of}} the {{mediating}} effects of substance use on the criminal justice involvement {{of the mentally ill}} have tended to focus on a single disorder, schizophrenia, and on violent crimes. This study examined the generality of the relationships <b>among</b> <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders,</b> substance use, and arrests for violent, nonviolent, and drug-related offenses using data collected for the 2001 and 2002 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Logistic regression models showed that for violent offenses, the statistical association between serious mental illness (SMI) and arrest across psychiatric diagnoses was substantially but only partially mediated by substance use. For nonviolent offenses and for drug-related offenses, the relationship between SMI and arrest was almost completely mediated by substance use and reduced to statistical nonsignificance. These findings suggest that co-occurring substance use increases the chances a person with any SMI, not just schizophrenia, will be arrested for any offense, not just violent offenses, but that the magnitude of this relationship varies by offense type and, to a lesser extent, by disorder...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of comorbidity {{is an open}} and complex research field in the branch of psychiatry, where clinical experience and several {{studies suggest that the}} relation <b>among</b> the <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> may have etiological and treatment implications. In this paper, we are interested in applying latent feature modeling to find the latent structure behind the <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> that can help to examine and explain the relationships among them. To this end, we use the large amount of information collected in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) database and propose to model these data using a nonparametric latent model based on the Indian Buffet Process (IBP). Due to the discrete nature of the data, we first need to adapt the observation model for discrete random variables. We propose a generative model in which the observations are drawn from a multinomial-logit distribution given the IBP matrix. The implementation of an efficient Gibbs sampler is accomplished using the Laplace approximation, which allows integrating out the weighting factors of the multinomial-logit likelihood model. We also provide a variational inference algorithm for this model, which provides a complementary (and less expensive in terms of computational complexity) alternative to the Gibbs sampler allowing us to deal with a larger number of data. Finally, we use the model to analyze comorbidity <b>among</b> the <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> diagnosed by experts from the NESARC database.

40|$|Comorbidity, the {{co-occurrence of}} disorders, is {{frequently}} observed to occur {{at higher rates}} in clinically ascertained samples than in population-based samples. An explanation for this finding is that subjects suffering from multiple illnesses {{are more likely to}} seek medical care and receive a diagnostic evaluation. We refer to the component of the comorbidity between illnesses due to such ascertainment bias as “spurious comorbidity. ” When spurious comorbidity is present, an apparent association between a candidate locus and the phenotype of interest may actually be attributable to an association between the locus and a comorbid phenotype. This phenomenon, which we call “spurious comorbidity bias, ” could thus produce misleading association findings. In this article, we describe this phenomenon and demonstrate that it may produce marked bias in the conclusions of familybased association studies. Because of the extremely high rates of comorbidity <b>among</b> <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> in clinical samples, this problem may be particularly salient for genetic studies of neuropsychiatric disorders.

40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a “spectrum” of disorders, {{characterized}} by {{varying degrees of}} symptoms ranging from mild to severe. <b>Among</b> <b>Psychiatric</b> <b>disorders,</b> Autism Spectrum Disorders have the strongest evidence for a genetic basis, yet the search for specific genes contributing to these often devastating developmental syndromes has proven extraordinarily difficult.

BP, like, ASD also has a strong genetic basis and identification of the candidate genes still remains an ongoing effort. Literature studies point to the hypothesis that ASD and BP have good chances of comorbidity and that they may share common pathways for their manifestation. But this hypothesis has not been worked on in depth. Thus, the study focuses on identifying the chances of their comorbidity by identifying their common pathways and the genes involved in the pathways and also discuss the degree of chances of their comorbidity based on the genes involved in the common pathways.

Mice with the ASD-linked InsG 3680 mutatio n manifest striatal synaptic transmission defects before weaning age and impaired juvenile social interaction, coinciding with the early onset of ASD symptoms. On the other hand, adult mice carrying the schizophrenia-linked R 1117 X mutation show profound synaptic defects in prefrontal cortex and social dominance behavior. Furthermore, we found differential Shank 3 mRNA stability and SHANK 1 / 2 upregulation in these two lines. These data demonstrate that different alleles of the same gene may have distinct phenotypes at molecular, synaptic, and circuit levels in mice, which may inform exploration of these relationships in human patients.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Among</b> <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders,</b> {{anorexia}} nervosa {{has the highest}} mortality rate. During an exacerbation of this illness, patients frequently present with nonspecific symptoms. Upon hospitalization, {{anorexia nervosa}} patients are often markedly bradycardic, which may be an adaptive response to progressive weight loss and negative energy balance. When anorexia nervosa patients manifest tachycardia, even heart rates in the 80 – 90 bpm range, a supervening acute illness should be suspected. Case presentation A 52 -year old woman with longstanding anorexia nervosa was hospitalized due to progressive leg pain, weakness, and fatigue accompanied by marked weight loss. On physical examination she was cachectic but in no apparent distress. She had fine lanugo-type hair over her face and arms with an erythematous rash noted on her palms and left lower extremity. Her blood pressure was 96 / 50 mm Hg and resting heart rate was 106 bpm though she appeared euvolemic. Laboratory tests revealed anemia, mild leukocytosis, and hypoalbuminemia. She was initially treated with enteral feedings for an exacerbation of anorexia nervosa, but increasing leukocytosis without fever and worsening left leg pain prompted the diagnosis of an indolent left lower extremity cellulitis. With antibiotic therapy her heart rate decreased to 45 bpm despite minimal restoration of body weight. Conclusions Bradycardia is a characteristic feature of anorexia nervosa particularly with significant weight loss. When anorexia nervosa patients present with nonspecific symptoms, resting tachycardia should prompt a search for potentially life-threatening conditions. </p...|$|E

40|$|Anorexia nervosa (AN) {{predominantly}} affects adolescent {{females and}} has {{the highest rate of}} mortality <b>among</b> <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> It is categorized as an Axis 1 Clinical Disorder in the DSM-IV and a Mental/Behavioural Disorder in the ICD- 9. No research, however, has been conducted on how the diagnostic terms and linguistic categorization of AN may psychologically and neurobiologically contribute to the etiology or duration of AN. Peer-reviewed scientific articles, case studies, and books were used to investigate this relationship. Medical terminology loses its original context when used in non-medical society, gaining the power a label that may catalyze the development of AN in individuals who are diagnosed early, or extend the duration of AN in established patients. Three related factors make patients with AN uniquely susceptible to the impact of language: body image disturbance, information processing bias, and hyper reactive amygdala function. Due to body image disturbance (BID), which is one of AN’s four diagnostic criteria, patients with AN are fundamentally unable to create a stable self-image. This results in a body image that fluctuates with external stimuli, particularly language. Testing using the modified Stroop test and the dot-probe methods has found that patients with AN demonstrate a hypersensitivity to AN-related words, indicating an information processing bias that increases their susceptibility to language-induced body image fluctuations. Patients with AN also demonstrate hyper reactive amygdala function. This area of the brain coordinates and initiates responses to perceived threats. In individuals with AN, the hyper reactive amygdala catalyzes AN tendencies in response to the perceived threat of negative evaluation by others, a fear that is perpetuated by labels like “disordered” and “diseased”. These AN tendencies are catalyzed because patients view thinness as a positive factor that will induce positive feedback; ironically, their thinness is what brings the label of 2 ̆ 2 disordered 2 ̆ 2 in the first place, resulting in a self-perpetuating cycle. Though diagnostic labels are necessary, more research on the linguistic etiological component of AN is necessary so that future treatment methods for AN may address and work to prevent the patients 2 ̆ 7 negative response to the language of diagnoses.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Among</b> <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> {{schizophrenia}} {{is often}} {{said to be the}} condition with the most disputed definition. The Bleulerian and Schneiderian approaches have given rise to diagnostic formulations that have varied with time and place. Controversies over the concept of schizophrenia were examined within European/North American settings in the early 1970 s but little has since been reported on the views of psychiatrists in developing countries. In Brazil both concepts are referred to in the literature. A scale was developed to measure adherence to Bleulerian and Schneiderian concepts among psychiatrists working in S. Paulo. METHODOLOGY: A self-reported questionnaire comprising seventeen visual analogue-scale statements related to Bleulerian and Schneiderian definitions of Shizophrenia, plus sociodemographic and training characteristics, was distributed to a non-randomised sample of 150 psychiatrists. The two sub-scales were assessed by psychometric methods for internal consistency, sub-scale structure and test-retest reliability. Items selected according to internal consistency were examined by a two-factor model exploratory factor analysis. Intraclass correlation coefficients described the stability of the scale. RESULTS: Replies were received from 117 psychiatrists (mean age 36 (SD 7. 9)), 74 % of whom were made and 26 % female. The Schneiderian scale showed better overall internal consistency than the Bleulerian scale. Intra-class correlation coefficients for test-retest comparisons were between 0. 5 and 0. 7 for Schneiderian items and 0. 2 and 0. 7 for Bleulerian items. There was no negative association between Bleulerian and Schneiderian scale scores, suggesting that respondents may hold both concepts. Place of training was significantly associated with the respondent's opinion; disagreement with a Bleulerian standpoint predominated for those trained at the University of S. Paulo. CONCLUSIONS: The less satisfactory reliability for the Bleulerian sub-scale limits confidence in the whole scale {{but on the other hand}} this questionnaire contributes to the understanding of the controversy over Bleulerian and Schneiderian models for conceptualisation of schizophrenia, the former requiring more inference and therefore being prone to unreliability. INTRODUÇÃO: Foi desenvolvida uma escala para medir aderência ao conceito Bleuleriano e Schneideriano de esquizofrenia entre psiquiatras trabalhando em São Paulo, analisando relações entre variáveis sociodemográficas e de formação sobre o escore obtido. MÉTODOS: Questionário contendo escala visual analógica com dezessete enunciados sobre conceitos Schneideriano e Bleuleriano de esquizofrenia, foi distribuído para 150 psiquiatras. As sub-escalas Bleuleriana e Schneideriana foram avaliadas por metódos psicométricos de consistência interna, estrutura das subescalas e confiabilidade test- reteste. RESULTADOS: Completaram o questionário 117 psiquiatras. A subescala Schneideriana demonstrou melhor consistência interna e melhores coeficientes de correlação intraclasse. Não houve associação negativa entre os escores das subescalas. Discordância com o conceito Bleuleriano predominou entre profissionais treinados na USP. CONCLUSÕES: A baixa confiabilidade da sub-escala Bleuleriana limita a confiabilidade do instrumento como um todo, embora contribua para a discussão dos modelos em questão.

40|$|Behavioral neuropsychiatric {{disorder}}s, such as {{bipolar disorder}} and schizophrenia, are severe and chronic mental illnesses {{that are difficult}} to diagnose due to changing diagnostic criteria, overlap of symptoms <b>among</b> <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> and the co-occurrence with other disorders. Moreover, they are an increasing problem in society and are accompanied by a whole range of other issues. A prominent problem in the clinic for instance is the wide variety in responses upon mood stabilizer treatment with only approximately half of the treated patients with bipolar disorder are considered responders. Furthermore, although these drugs have been used for decades, until today it is not clear which affected molecules or pathways in particular are responsible for their beneficial clinical effects. Also, studies searching for genetic polymorphisms associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have proven difficult, even when using large patient samples, due to the complexity of variants involved in these disorders and the heterogeneity of the patient population. In this thesis we demonstrate that Drosophila melanogaster can be used successfully as a genetically tractable model to perform pharmacogenetic studies for psychiatric disorders. Firstly, we identify genetic factors that influence variation in drug response for mood stabilizing drugs, lithium and valproate, as measured by variation in aggressive behavior. By means of a simple behavioral assay we demonstrate that there are not only time-dependent differences in genetic factors that are affected by these two drugs, but that lithium and valproate are also different with respect to genetic markers associated with their effects. We also find significantly enriched functional categories within the genes that were identified as contributing to genotype by environment interaction for both drugs. Genes with functions in axonogenesis, neural development and differentiation and genes encoding ion channels, were relevant for variation of this behavior and therefore potentially valuable targets for validation in patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Secondly, we find differentially regulated transcripts upon treatment of cells with the two mood stabilizers. A key finding {{is that there is no}} overlap between lithium and valproate with respect to their effects on individual transcripts, notwithstanding their similar therapeutic effect and similar effect on neurons. However, we also find several pathways affected by both drugs, such as triacylglyceride synthesis, the Notch pathway and glycogen metabolism. Next, we identify transcripts whose expression is affected by both mood stabilizers in the cells and in Drosophila heads to then determine whether such transcripts are involved in adult behavior. We show that a high number of genes alter the startle-induced locomotion response, a simple model for sensorimotor gating, a process affected in several neuropsychiatric disorders. So, by making an overlap of genes whose transcription is differentially modulated upon lithium and VPA treatment of cells and the fruit flys nervous system, we found a high number of genes that are involved in the modulation of a behavioral response in a stimulus-induced arousal test. By means of two different approaches, we demonstrate the complexity and importantly the differences in the effects of the mood stabilizing drugs, lithium and valproate, at the transcript level. Moreover, our experiments and others can eventually lead to the identification of important biological pathways and key mechanisms in psychiatric disorders. Our data indicate that evidence from cell and animal models in combination with current knowledge in psychiatric genetics can provide more biological meaning and insight into different pathways and mechanisms that not only control variation of treatment response, but are also affected by mood stabilizer treatment and may be important in the etiology of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Thirdly, we determine whether human homologs of Drosophila genes affected by mood stabilizing drugs and genes related to the networks in which they play an important role are implicated in psychiatric disorders. After analyzing these genes in patients with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and control individuals, we find significant allelic associations with both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This approach of analyzing convergent genomic data proves to be very efficient for the identification of functional gene categories potentially important for the etiology of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and may be very relevant to identify the most interesting mechanisms to target with new, innovative and disorder-modifying, therapeutic agents. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In this study, we {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of major depression on quality of life (QoL) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Method: The study sample was composed of MS outpatients with (n= 20) only major depression <b>among</b> the <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders,</b> MS outpatients without (n= 20) any <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder,</b> and healthy subjects (control group, n= 20) without any <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder.</b> The <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> were determined {{by means of the}} Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I). The World Health Organization QoL Assessment-Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) was performed to assess the participants’ QoL levels. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was used to determine degree of disability due to MS. Results: The groups were similar with regard to sociodemographic factors. MS patients without any <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> had a significantly lower physical health subscale score of WHOQOL-BREF than the control group. There {{was no significant difference between}} these two groups in terms of other WHOQOL-BREF subscale scores. Compared to MS patients without any <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder,</b> all subscale scores of the WHOQOL-BREF was significantly lower in MS patients with major depression. There was no significant correlation between EDSS score, age and disease duration and WHOQOL-BREF scores. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggests that comorbid major depression is an important factor in addition to MS itself in determining of QoL in patients with multiple sclerosis.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed at}} {{examining}} correlates {{of substance use}} among patients diagnosed with <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> in Jordan. Methods: This study used a non-experimental descriptive survey design. Data were collected through using DUSI–R scale obtained through a self-designed questionnaire. A total of (203) subjects satisfied the inclusion criteria. Results: Most used substances prior to admission were caffeine (78. 2 %), cigarette (60. 9 %), and alcohol (22. 2 %), while the least were heroin (1. 2 %) and inhalants (0. 08 %). Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia had higher percentages among all other disorders (n = 16, 21. 9 %), {{although there was no}} statistical difference among patients related to their <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> Conclusion: We recommend that mental health professionals be equipped with necessary skills to manage substance use <b>among</b> patients with <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates to {{what extent}} <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> and mental {{distress}} affect labor market outcomes in two rapidly growing populations {{that have not been}} studied to date-ethnic minorities of Latino and Asian descent, most of whom are immigrants. Using data from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), we examine the labor market effects of meeting diagnostic criteria for any <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> in the past 12 months as well as the effects of psychiatric distress in the past year. The labor market outcomes analyzed are current employment status, the number of weeks worked in the past year among those who are employed, and having at least one work absence in the past month among those who are employed. <b>Among</b> Latinos, <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> and mental distress are associated with detrimental effects on employment and absenteeism, similar to effects found in previous analyses of mostly white, American born populations. Among Asians, we find more mixed evidence that <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> and mental distress detract from labor market outcomes. Our findings suggest that reducing disparities and expanding access to effective treatment may have significant labor market benefits-not just for majority populations, as has been demonstrated, but also for Asians and Latinos.

40|$|Background: <b>Among</b> {{patients}} with <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders,</b> there are 10 {{times as many}} preventable deaths from physical disorders as there are from suicide. We investigated whether compulsory community treatment, such as community treatment orders, could reduce all-cause mortality <b>among</b> {{patients with}} <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> Methods: We conducted a population-based survival analysis of an inception cohort using record linking. The study period extended from November 1997 to December 2008. The cohort included patients from all community-based and inpatient psychiatric services in Western Australia (state population 1. 8 million). We used a 2 -stage design of matching and Cox regression to adjust for demographic characteristics, previous use of health services, diagnosis and length of psychiatric history. We collected data on successive cohorts for each year for which community treatment orders were used to measure changes in numbers of patients, their characteristics and outcomes. Our primary outcome was 2 -year all-cause mortality. Our secondary outcomes were 1 -and 3 -year all-cause mortality. Results: The study population included 2958 patients with community treatment orders (cases) and 2958 matched controls (i. e., patients with <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> who had not received a community treatment order). The average age for cases and controls was 36. 7 years, and 63. 7 % (3771) of participants were men. Schizophrenia and other nonaffective psychoses were the most common diagnoses (73. 4 %) among participants. A total of 492 patients (8. 3 %) died during the study. Cox regression showed that, compared with controls, patients with community treatment orders had significantly lower all-cause mortality at 1, 2 and 3 years, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0. 62 (95 % confidence interval 0. 45 - 0. 86) at 2 years. The greatest effect was on death from physical illnesses such as cancer, cardiovascular disease or diseases of the central nervous system. This association disappeared when we adjusted for increased outpatient and community contacts with psychiatric services. Interpretation: Community treatment orders might reduce mortality <b>among</b> patients with <b>psychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> This may be partly explained by increased contact with health services in the community. However, the effects of uncontrolled confounders cannot be excluded. No Full Tex...|$|R
