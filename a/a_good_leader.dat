5|$|Khal Drogo's khalasar {{arrives at}} the city of Vaes Dothrak. Viserys Targaryen impatiently waits for the army Drogo agreed to lend him, the bride price offered for his sister Daenerys, to reconquer the Seven Kingdoms. When Viserys misinterprets Daenerys's {{invitation}} to dinner as an order, he becomes angry and strikes her. For the first time, Daenerys fights back, hitting her astounded brother and promising that if he raises a hand against her again, his hands will be cut off. Later, the banished knight Jorah Mormont tells her that Viserys would not be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>leader</b> for the invasion of Westeros and, despite what Viserys believes, {{the people of the}} Seven Kingdoms do not care who rules them {{as long as they are}} ruled well. Daenerys agrees that Viserys could not conquer the Seven Kingdoms even if Khal Drogo gave him an entire army.|$|E
25|$|When the {{revolution}} collapsed, Heine resumed his oppositional stance. At {{first he had}} some hope Louis Napoleon might be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>leader</b> in France but he soon began to share the opinion of Marx towards him as the new emperor began {{to crack down on}} liberalism and socialism. In 1848 Heine also returned to religious faith. In fact, he had never claimed to be an atheist. Nevertheless, he remained sceptical of organised religion.|$|E
25|$|According to Berlusconi's {{political}} and entrepreneurial opponents, Berlusconismo {{is only a}} form of demagogic populism, comparable to Fascism, in part because Berlusconi has defended aspects of the regime of Benito Mussolini, {{even though he has}} criticised the racial Fascist laws and the alliance with Nazi Germany, referring to himself as pro-Israel. In 2013, he returned to calling Mussolini <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>leader</b> whose biggest mistake was signing up to exterminate the Jews. Conrastingly his supporters compare Berlusconismo to French Gaullism and Argentinian Peronism.|$|E

25|$|Richthofen and Sperrle made an {{effective}} team in Spain. Sperrle was an experienced officer and was intelligent, {{with a good}} reputation. Richthofen was considered <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>leader</b> in combat. They combined to disagree with Franco {{on a number of}} topics and debates could become heated. Both men were blunt, and although the Germans and Spanish did not like each other, they had a healthy respect which translated into {{an effective}} working relationship. Richthofen even learned a little Spanish and Italian, an effort appreciated by the Nationalist officers.|$|E
25|$|Thucydides admired Pericles, {{approving}} of {{his power}} over the people and showing a marked distaste for the demagogues who followed him. He did not approve of the democratic commoners nor the radical democracy that Pericles ushered in but considered democracy acceptable when guided by <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>leader.</b> Thucydides's presentation of events is generally even-handed; for example, he does not minimize the negative effect of his own failure at Amphipolis. Occasionally, however, strong passions break through, as in his scathing appraisals of the democratic leaders Cleon and Hyperbolus. Cleon has sometimes been connected with Thucydides's exile.|$|E

500|$|Castro {{had made}} his opinion clear that lawyer Manuel Urrutia Lleó should become president, leading a {{provisional}} civilian government following Batista's fall. Politically moderate, Urrutia had defended MR-26-7 revolutionaries in court, arguing that the Moncada Barracks attack was legal according to the Cuban constitution. Castro believed Urrutia would make <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>leader,</b> being both established yet sympathetic to the revolution. With {{the leaders of the}} junta under arrest, Urrutia was proclaimed provisional president, with Castro erroneously announcing he had been selected by [...] "popular election"; most of Urrutia's cabinet were MR-26-7 members. On January 8, 1959, Castro's army entered Havana. Proclaiming himself Representative of the Rebel Armed Forces of the Presidency, Castro [...] along with close aides and family members [...] set up home and office in the penthouse of the Havana Hilton Hotel, there meeting with journalists, foreign visitors and government ministers.|$|E
500|$|Soegijapranata {{is remembered}} with pride by Javanese Catholics, who praise his {{strength}} of will during the occupation and national revolution. The historian Anhar Gonggong described Soegijapranata as {{not just a}} bishop, but an Indonesian leader who [...] "was tested as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>leader</b> and deserved the hero status". The Indonesian historian Anton Haryono described Soegijapranata's ascension to bishophood as [...] "monumental", considering that Soegijapranata had only been ordained nine years previously and was chosen ahead of non-Indonesian priests several years his senior. Henricia Moeryantini, a nun in the Order of Carolus Borromeus, writes that the Catholic Church became nationally influential under Soegijapranata, and that the archbishop cared {{too much for the}} people to take an outsider's approach. Van Klinken writes that Soegijapranata eventually became like a priyayi, or Javanese nobleman, within the church, as [...] "committed to hierarchy and the status quo as to the God who created them". According to van Klinken, by coming to the nascent republic Soegijapranata had been willing to see [...] "the coming Javanese paradise" [...] at a great personal risk.|$|E

500|$|In 1916, Thonburi was {{not part}} of Bangkok yet, and had no bridge to connect it to Bangkok. Wat Paknam faced social and {{disciplinary}} problems, and required <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>leader.</b> Luang Pu Sodh promoted and enforced strict monastic discipline. He was able to change Wat Paknam Bhascharoen, a temple that was neglected and almost vacant, into a temple with hundreds of monks, a school for Buddhist studies, but also a government-approved primary school with a mundane curriculum, and a kitchen to make the temple self-sufficient. Apart from monastic residents, the kitchen would also provide food for all the lay visitors of the temple. Wat Paknam became a popular center of meditation teaching. Luang Pu Sodh emphasized the development of people more than construction: besides developing a large community of monks in the temple (in 1959, five hundred monks), he also set up a community of [...] (nuns), with separate kutis and meditation rooms. Mae chis {{played an important role in}} Wat Paknam's Dhamma and meditation propagation. In the first period, Luang Pu Sodh's work was not appreciated by some lay people who, according to biographies, had illegal business with the temple and did not appreciate Luang Pu Sodh changing the temple. Once he was even shot at, though not hurt.|$|E
500|$|Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters {{described}} The Red Sea Sharks as a [...] "complex, ambiguous, even labyrinthine" [...] story {{which was}} [...] "undoubtedly {{the book in}} which Hergé ventured furthest into the creation of his own universe." [...] He thought that [...] "Hergé enters a new phase" [...] with The Red Sea Sharks, as its author [...] "seems to know his family of characters better and better, and he enjoys playing with them and his readers." [...] Peeters noted that the book was [...] "in some respects a continuation" [...] of Land of Black Gold, an assessment shared by Thompson, the Lofficiers, and Farr, all of whom {{described it as a}} partial sequel to the earlier book. Thompson added that The Red Sea Sharks [...] "atoned for the relative failure" [...] of Land of Black Gold, believing that although it had a [...] "rather hasty finish", it was [...] "a first-rate thriller". The Lofficiers awarded it four out of five, stating that it was [...] "very effective as a modern political thriller and far more believable than The Calculus Affair". They also opined that it provided an effective political commentary on the West's relationship with the Arab world. In their analysis, Tintin and Haddock seek to aid the Emir not because he is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>leader,</b> but for their own selfish purposes (to get Abdullah out of Marlinspike), just as Western governments and corporations build alliances with Arab leaders guilty of human rights abuses in order to benefit their own interests.|$|E

It discusses some of the engineering potentials like creativity, drive for implementation of concepts, the strength behind an introverted nature, and social responsibility {{and how it can}} be adapted for leadership position. It compares and contrasts engineers and scientists as far as leadership are concerned. The summary of the findings is that <b>a</b> <b>good</b> engineer can make <b>a</b> <b>good</b> political <b>Leader...</b>|$|R

2500|$|In contrast, {{the concept}} of [...] "employeeship" [...] recognizes that {{what it takes to}} be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>leader</b> is not too {{dissimilar}} to {{what it takes to be}} a good employee. Therefore, bringing the notional leader together with the team to explore these similarities (rather than focusing on the differences) brings positive results.

2500|$|Rabbi Isaac deduced from [...] that we {{must not}} appoint a leader over a {{community}} without first consulting the community.

God told Moses nonetheless to go and consult the Israelites. Moses asked the Israelites whether they considered Bezalel suitable. And they replied that if God and Moses considered him suitable, surely they had to, as well. Rabbi Johanan taught that God proclaims three things for God's Self: famine, plenty, and <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>leader.</b> 2 Kings [...] shows that God proclaims famine, when it says: [...] "The Lord {{has called for a}} famine."

[...] And [...] shows that God proclaims <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>leader,</b> when it says: [...] "And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, ‘See I have called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri.'" [...] Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in the name of Rabbi Johanan that Bezalel ( [...] , whose name can be read , betzel El, [...] "in the shadow of God") was so called because of his wisdom. When God told Moses (in [...] ) to tell Bezalel to make a tabernacle, an ark, and vessels, Moses reversed the order and told Bezalel to make an ark, vessels, and a tabernacle. Bezalel replied to Moses that as a rule, one first builds a house and then brings vessels into it, but Moses directed to make an ark, vessels, and a tabernacle. Bezalel asked where he would put the vessels. And Bezalel asked whether God had told Moses to make a tabernacle, an ark, and vessels. Moses replied that perhaps Bezalel had been in the shadow of God ( [...] , betzel El) and had thus come to know this.|$|E
