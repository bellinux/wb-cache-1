5|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> is {{a species}} of seabird in the order Charadriiformes. It is in the auk family, Alcidae, which {{includes}} the guillemots, typical auks, murrelets, auklets, puffins and the razorbill. The rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) and the puffins are closely related, together composing the tribe Fraterculini. The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> is the only species in the genus Fratercula {{to occur in the}} Atlantic Ocean. Two other species are known from the northeast Pacific, the tufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata) and the horned puffin (Fratercula corniculata), the latter being the closest relative of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change may}} well affect populations of seabirds in the {{northern}} Atlantic. The most important demographic may {{be an increase in}} the sea surface temperature which may have benefits for some northerly <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> colonies. Breeding success depends on there being ample supplies of food at the time of maximum demand, as the chick grows. In northern Norway the main food item fed to the chick is the young herring. The success of the newly hatched fish larvae during the previous year was governed by the water temperature, which controlled plankton abundance and this in turn influenced the growth and survival of the first-year herring. The breeding success of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> colonies has been found to correlate in this way with the water surface temperatures of the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Like many seabirds, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> {{spends most}} of the year far from land in the open ocean and only visits coastal areas to breed. It is a sociable bird and it usually breeds in large colonies.|$|E

5|$|In {{the modern}} era avian life {{includes}} the corncrake, red-throated diver, rock dove, kittiwake, tystie, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin,</b> goldeneye, golden eagle and white-tailed sea eagle. The last named was re-introduced to Rùm in 1975 and has successfully spread to various neighbouring islands, including Mull. There is a small population of red-billed chough concentrated on the islands of Islay and Colonsay.|$|E
5|$|Otters, grey seals, {{killer whales}} and harbour {{porpoises}} are frequently seen on and around Papa Stour. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin,</b> Arctic and common tern, bonxie and Arctic skua, northern fulmar, common guillemot, razorbill, curlew, wheatear, ringed plover and {{great black-backed gull}} all breed on the island, and numerous migratory species have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|The museum's {{permanent}} display encompasses mineralogical and petrographical collections, {{as well as}} {{a collection}} of animals, the bulk of which dates back to the 19th century. The zoological collection is {{on the second floor of}} the museum. It includes the skeleton of a Mediterranean monk seal, a basking shark native to the Adriatic Sea and an <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin,</b> a bird today native to the Arctic area, which is believed to have nested in the Adriatic in the 19th century.|$|E

50|$|The {{island is}} known for its seabirds, {{including}} Manx shearwaters and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffins,</b> and for its plants, including red fescue, sea beet and common tree-mallow.|$|R
50|$|The {{island has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially European storm petrels (5000 pairs) and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffins</b> (10,000 pairs).|$|R
5|$|Spending {{the autumn}} and {{winter in the}} open ocean of the cold {{northern}} seas, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> returns to coastal areas {{at the start of}} the breeding season in late spring. It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white egg is laid. The chick mostly feeds on whole fish and grows rapidly. After about six weeks it is fully fledged and makes its way at night to the sea. It swims away from the shore and does not return to land for several years.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins lead solitary existences when {{out at sea}} {{and this}} part of their life has been little studied as the task of finding even one bird on the vast ocean is formidable. When at sea, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> bobs about like a cork, {{propelling}} itself through the water with powerful thrusts of its feet and keeping itself turned into the wind, even when resting and apparently asleep. It spends much time each day preening to keep its plumage in order and spread oil from the preen gland. Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation. In common with other seabirds, its upper surface is black and underside white. This provides camouflage, with aerial predators unable to observe the bird against the dark watery background and underwater attackers failing to notice it as it blends in with the bright sky above the waves.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> {{and other}} pelagic birds are {{excellent}} bioindicators {{of the environment}} as they occupy a high trophic level. Heavy metals and other pollutants are concentrated through the food chain and, as fish are the primary food source for Atlantic puffins, there is great potential for them to bioaccumulate heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic. Measurements can be made on eggs, feathers or internal organs and beached bird surveys, accompanied by chemical analysis of feathers, can be effective indicators of marine pollution by lipophilic substances as well as metals. In fact these surveys {{can be used to}} provide evidence of the adverse effects of a particular pollutant, using fingerprinting techniques to provide evidence suitable for the prosecution of offenders.|$|E
50|$|Puffin Island holds {{important}} {{populations of}} several seabird species, including <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffins,</b> Manx shearwaters and European storm-petrels, and was acquired as a nature reserve by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy (now BirdWatch Ireland) {{in the early}} 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The {{island has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially European storm petrels, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffins</b> (30,000 pairs) and black guillemots (100 pairs).|$|R
50|$|The island {{serves as}} a haven for seabirds, {{including}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffins,</b> black guillemots, fulmars and Arctic terns. There are two other islands known as Lundey in Iceland: one in Skagafjörður fjörd {{and the other in}} Skjálfandi bay, both in north Iceland.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> is {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of four to five years. The birds are colonial nesters, {{excavating}} burrows on grassy clifftops or reusing existing holes, and may also nest in crevices and amongst rocks and scree on occasion. It is in competition with other birds and animals for burrows. It can excavate its own hole or move into a pre-existing system dug by a rabbit and has been known to peck and drive off the original occupant. Manx shearwaters also nest underground and often live in their own burrows alongside puffins, and their burrowing activities may break through into the puffin's living quarters resulting in the loss of the egg. They are monogamous (they mate for life) and give biparental care to their young. The male spends more time guarding and maintaining the nest while the female is more involved in incubation and feeding the chick.|$|E
5|$|Having {{spent the}} winter {{alone on the}} ocean, {{it is unclear whether}} the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> meets its {{previous}} partner offshore or whether they encounter each other when they return to their nest of the previous year. On land, they soon set about improving and clearing out the burrow. Often, one stands outside the entrance while the other excavates, kicking out quantities of soil and grit that showers the partner standing outside. Some birds collect stems and fragments of dry grasses as nesting materials but others do not bother. Sometimes a beakful of materials is taken underground, only to be brought out again and discarded. Apart from nest-building, the other way in which the birds restore their bond is by billing. This is a practice in which the pair approach each other, each wagging its head from side to side, and then rattle their beaks together. This seems to be an important element of their courtship behaviour because it happens repeatedly, and the birds continue to bill, to a lesser extent, throughout the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|In a {{long-lived}} {{bird with}} a small clutch size such as the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin,</b> the survival rate of adults {{is an important factor}} influencing the success of the species. Only 5% of the ringed puffins that failed to reappear at the colony did so during the breeding season. The rest were lost some time between departing from land in the summer and reappearing the following spring. The birds spend the winter widely spread out in the open ocean, though there is a tendency for individuals from different colonies to overwinter in different areas. Little is known of their behaviour and diet at sea but no correlation was found between environmental factors, such as temperature variations, and their mortality rate. A combination of the availability of food in winter and summer probably influences the survival of the birds, since individuals starting the winter in poor condition are less likely to survive than those in good condition.|$|E
40|$|During the 2002 season, weather {{conditions}} on the Isle of May were poor, with much more rain than usual, and strong westerly and easterly winds. Common guillemots, razorbills, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffins</b> and black-legged kittiwakes experienced lower breeding success relative to the long-term average, although common guillemots and razorbills did better than in 2001. In contrast, northern fulmars had their best season since 1995, and European shags had their best season ever. Timing of breeding for all species was normal, although European shags and black-legged kittiwakes started breeding earlier than in 2001. Return rates for razorbills and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffins</b> were close to the long-term average, whereas those for common guillemots and black-legged kittiwakes were around 6...|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{coastline}} {{of the island}} {{has been identified as}} an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially European storm petrels (5000 pairs), <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffins</b> (20,000 pairs) and black guillemots (50 pairs).|$|R
50|$|There are an {{estimated}} 30,000 birds living on the cliffs, representing more than 20 species. These include <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffins,</b> which live in large colonies at isolated parts of the cliffs and on the small Goat Island, and razorbills.The site is an Important Bird Area.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> is a bird of the colder {{waters of}} the North Atlantic Ocean. It breeds on the coasts of north west Europe, the Arctic fringes and eastern North America. More than 90% of the global {{population}} is found in Europe (4,770,000-5,780,000 pairs, equalling 9,550,000-11,600,000 adults) and colonies in Iceland alone are home to 60% of the world's Atlantic puffins. The largest colony in the western Atlantic (estimated at more than 260,000 pairs) {{can be found at}} the Witless Bay Ecological Reserve, south of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. Other major breeding locations include the north and west coasts of Norway, the Faroe Islands, the Shetland and Orkney islands, the west coast of Greenland and the coasts of Newfoundland. Smaller sized colonies are also found elsewhere in the British Isles, the Murmansk area of Russia, Novaya Zemlya, Spitzbergen, Labrador, Nova Scotia and Maine. Islands seem particularly attractive to the birds for breeding as compared to mainland sites.|$|E
5|$|Aerial predators of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> {{include the}} {{great black-backed gull}} (Larus marinus), the great skua (Stercorarius skua), and similar-sized species, which can catch a bird in flight, or attack one that is unable to escape fast enough on the ground. On {{detecting}} danger, puffins take off and fly down {{to the safety of}} the sea or retreat into their burrows, but if caught they defend themselves vigorously with beak and sharp claws. When the puffins are wheeling round beside the cliffs it becomes very difficult for a predator to concentrate on a single bird while any individual isolated on the ground is at greater risk. Smaller gull species like the herring gull (L. argentatus) and the lesser black-backed gull are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult puffin. They stride through the colony taking any eggs that have rolled towards burrow entrances or recently hatched chicks that have ventured too far towards the daylight. They will also steal fish from puffins returning to feed their young. Where it nests on the tundra in the far north, the Arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses puffins while they are airborne forcing them to drop their catch which it then snatches up.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, puffin numbers {{increased}} considerably {{in the late}} twentieth century in the North Sea, including on the Isle of May and the Farne Islands where numbers increased by about 10% per year. In the 2013 breeding season, nearly 40,000 pairs were recorded on the Farne Islands, a slight increase on the 2008 census and on the previous year's poor season when some of the burrows flooded. This number is dwarfed by the Icelandic colonies with five million pairs breeding, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> being the most populous bird on the island. In the Westman Islands, where about half Iceland's puffins breed, the birds were almost driven to extinction by overharvesting around 1900 and a thirty-year ban on hunting was put in place. When stocks recovered, a different method of harvesting was used and now hunting is maintained at a sustainable level. Nevertheless, a further hunting ban covering the whole of Iceland was called for in 2011, although the puffin's lack of recent breeding success was being blamed on a diminution in food supply rather than overharvesting. Since 2000, a sharp population decline has been seen in Iceland, Norway, Faroe Islands and Greenland. A similar trend has been seen in the United Kingdom, where an increase in 1969-2000 appears to have been reversed. For example, the Fair Isle colony was estimated at 20,200 individuals in 1986, but it had been almost halved by 2012. Based on current trends, it is estimated that the European population will decline by 50-79% between 2000 and 2065.|$|E
5000|$|The {{island was}} {{inhabited}} from {{the settlement of}} Iceland until 1966. There still is a lighthouse, a dwelling house, a church and a weather station on the island, the latter automated since 1998. There are also large colonies of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffins</b> on the island.|$|R
50|$|The Flannan Isles provide nesting for a {{population}} of seabirds, including <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffins,</b> northern fulmars, European storm-petrels, Leach's petrels, common shag and black-legged kittiwakes. There is a gannetry on Roaireim. From the late Middle Ages on, Lewismen regularly raided these nests for eggs, birds and feathers.|$|R
