5|$|Unlike {{the other}} nerves {{supplying}} the larynx, {{the right and}} left RLNs lack bilateral symmetry. The left RLN is longer than the right, because it crosses under the <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> the aorta at the ligamentum arteriosum.|$|E
5|$|An early medieval wall {{stands to}} the west of the <b>Arch</b> <b>of</b> Caracalla; it was built after the end of the Roman occupation, {{apparently}} some time in the 5th or 6th centuries, to protect the eastern side of the city's new residential area. It was oriented in a north-south direction and was constructed using stone looted from ruined buildings elsewhere in the abandoned areas of the city.|$|E

5|$|Arches 4 and 6 {{produce the}} {{laryngeal}} cartilages. The nerve {{of the sixth}} arch becomes the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The nerve of the fourth arch {{gives rise to the}} superior laryngeal nerve. The arteries of the fourth arch, which project between the nerves of the fourth and sixth arches, become the left-sided <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> the aorta and the right subclavian artery. The arteries of the sixth arch persists as the ductus arteriosus on the left, and is obliterated on the right.|$|E
5|$|Examples of Roman {{sculpture}} survive abundantly, {{though often}} in damaged or fragmentary condition, including freestanding statues and statuettes in marble, bronze and terracotta, and reliefs from public buildings, temples, and monuments {{such as the}} Ara Pacis, Trajan's Column, and the <b>Arch</b> <b>of</b> Titus. Niches in amphitheatres such as the Colosseum were originally filled with statues, and no formal garden was complete without statuary.|$|E
5|$|In {{each corner}} of the chapel is a {{triangular}} pendentive filling {{the space between the}} walls and the <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> the vault and forming the spandrel above the windows nearest the corners.

5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone.

5|$|The most {{important}} building Domitian restored was the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, {{said to have}} been covered with a gilded roof.

5|$|The west front has {{two large}} {{flanking}} three-stage towers. On the rear outer {{corners of the}} towers are octagonal stair turrets with panels on the belfry stage. Between the towers is a deep entrance <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> six orders with decorative Purbeck Marble colonnettes and enriched mouldings to the arch. The tympanum of the arch contains an empty niche.|$|E
5|$|To {{foster the}} worship of the {{imperial}} family, he erected a dynastic mausoleum {{on the site of}} Vespasian's former house on the Quirinal, and completed the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, a shrine dedicated to {{the worship of}} his deified father and brother. To memorialize the military triumphs of the Flavian family, he ordered the construction of the Templum Divorum and the Templum Fortuna Redux, and completed the <b>Arch</b> <b>of</b> Titus.|$|E

5|$|Apparently Constantine did not patronize Christianity alone. After gaining {{victory in}} the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312), a triumphal arch—the <b>Arch</b> <b>of</b> Constantine—was built (315) to {{celebrate}} his triumph. The arch is decorated with images of the goddess Victoria. At {{the time of its}} dedication, sacrifices to gods like Apollo, Diana, and Hercules were made. Absent from the Arch are any depictions of Christian symbolism. However, as the Arch was commissioned by the Senate, the absence of Christian symbols may reflect the role of the Curia at the time as a pagan redoubt.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} legal status as {{citizens}} {{and the degree to}} which they could become emancipated, women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business, including shipping, manufacturing, and lending money. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could acquire and dispose of considerable fortunes; for instance, the <b>Arch</b> <b>of</b> the Sergii was funded by Salvia Postuma, a female member of the family honoured, and the largest building in the forum at Pompeii was funded by Eumachia, a priestess of Venus.|$|E
5|$|Every {{window in}} the church {{contains}} coloured glass (except the two tiny windows in the chapel of St Padarn). The windows are mostly narrow single lancets, and {{at the ends of}} the transepts and at the west end are arranged one and two. Some are possibly mediaeval, in the same eroded yellow stone as the quoins. The west and south gables have three windows, spaced two below and one above. The north has two only window. There are four lancets to the nave on the north, with three and the porch to the south. The transepts also have single lancet windows east and west. The north transept has a nineteenth century two-light east window with the relieving <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> an older window well above.|$|E

5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the sole of the foot venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E
5|$|Plante finally {{retired from}} hockey in 1975, {{after the death}} of his {{youngest}} son. He moved to Switzerland with his second wife, Raymonde Udrisard, but remained active on the North American hockey scene as an analyst, adviser, and goaltender trainer. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1978. In the fall of 1985, Plante was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer. He died in a Geneva hospital in February 1986 and was buried in Sierre, Switzerland. When his coffin was carried from the church following the funeral mass, it passed under an <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> hockey sticks held high by a team of young hockey players from Quebec, visiting Switzerland for a tournament.|$|E
5|$|Stone bridge {{construction}} {{started with the}} excavation of foundations for the abutments. Then a temporary structure known as a center or centering would be built of wood or iron. This structure supported the stone arch during construction. Once the stone arch was built, the spandrel walls and wing walls could be added. Then the road bed was built, with fill (loose stones or dirt) added to support it as needed. Wall and arch stones were generally set in place dry to ensure a good fit, then set in mortar. Once the bridge was complete and the mortar had properly hardened, the center was gradually lowered and then removed. In March 1996, after standing for between 156 and 121 years, the <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> Bridge No. 3 finally collapsed.|$|E
