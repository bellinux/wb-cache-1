2500|$|On July 31, 2007, Donaire met Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Donaire {{said the}} {{experience}} was, [...] "an overwhelming feeling. It was indescribable. The moment I {{walked up the}} stairs and she was up there <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> it was a moment when I couldn't even look at her face. It was a great honor." [...] Then, on December 1, 2007, Donaire made the first defense of his IBF title against Luis Maldonado of Mexico by a technical knockout in the eighth round. Donaire said, [...] "I guess my validation was today but I didn't feel my best; I felt sluggish. I didn't have my legs. I don't know what the problem was. I couldn't move well so I tried to rely on my upper body movement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ponting {{also had}} his first {{confrontation}} with Harbhajan Singh, an Indian off spinner {{who went on to}} have much success against him. In the Coca-Cola Cup series ODI against India in April, he and Mark Waugh put on more than 80 runs in 12 overs before Harbhajan was introduced into the attack. In the spinners second over, Ponting took him for four then lofted him over mid-wicket for six next ball. The following delivery saw Ponting use his feet in an attempt to get to the pitch of the ball but missed the shot and was consequently stumped. After the dismissal the pair clashed verbally. Ponting wrote, [...] "The Sharjah incident was the result of me being over-competitive but it had the potential to get quite nasty. I was really disappointed with the shot I played [...] <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> up Harbahjan was right in my face giving me the finger [...] and really mouthing off. Had he been a few more metres away from me I would have not reacted like I did or at the most I would have given him a bit of lip as I walked past. I just over-reacted to the provocation." [...] Both players were consequently fined ($500) and reprimanded by the match referee, with Harbhajan also suspended for a single ODI as he was adjudged to have breached the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct.|$|E

60|$|It is a feat {{beyond me}} {{to realize that}} he is sixty-nine years old. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at the {{tremendous}} build of him and at his fearful, man-handling hands, I conjure up a vision of him avenging Captain Somers's murder.|$|R

6000|$|... "Never!" [...] she {{answered}} contemptuously, [...] "in {{this or any}} other world. Never! Why, you are hateful to me; <b>when</b> <b>I</b> see you, I shiver as though a snake crawled across my foot, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at your hands they are red with blood, the blood of my parents and of Noie's parents, and of many others.

5000|$|Speaking of the trio's {{experience}} {{playing the}} music of Lead Belly, Blind Lemon Jefferson and other black blues musicians, Koerner later related, [...] "I don’t understand the psychology of it, but somehow we decided to imitate these guys down to the note.
