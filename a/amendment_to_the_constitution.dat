5|$|Magoffin's {{plan was}} to unite the slave states around a set of minimum {{concessions}} {{to see if the}} North would accept them as an alternative to war. The concessions included a constitutional amendment repealing any state law that interfered with enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act, passage of amendments to the Fugitive Slave Act ensuring that any state that would not return a fugitive slave or obstructed a slave's return would compensate the owner of the slave, passage of a law requiring extradition of anyone indicted by a grand jury for enticing the escape of a slave, passage of an <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> guaranteeing slavery in all current and future territories south of 36 degrees north latitude, passage of an <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> guaranteeing all states the right of using the Mississippi River, and provide protection for southern states in the U.S. Senate from oppressive slavery legislation.

5|$|Churchill {{has been}} a leader of Colorado AIM's annual protests in Denver against the Columbus Day holiday and its {{associated}} parade. Colorado AIM's leadership has come into conflict with some leaders in the Denver Italian American community, the main supporters of the parade. As early as 2004, Churchill had claimed that such parades are unconstitutional, arguing that the Ninth <b>Amendment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> provides Native Americans with a right not to be subjected to such displays, overriding the First Amendment rights of non-Native Americans.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} 1792 Kentucky Constitution had {{the governor}} chosen by an electoral college for {{a term of}} four years. The second constitution in 1799 changed this to a popular vote, and prevented governors from succeeding themselves within seven years of their terms.

A 1992 <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> allowed governors {{to have a second}} term before being prevented from succeeding themselves for four years.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{stayed on}} as {{president}} of the UCR, leaving after the party's defeat in the 1991 legislative elections. Suffering damage to its image because of the hyperinflation of 1989, the UCR lost in several districts. Alfonsín became president of the party again in 1993. He supported the creation of a special budget for the province of Buenos Aires, led by governor Eduardo Duhalde. The radical legislator Leopoldo Moreau supported the new budget even more vehemently than the Peronists. Both parties had an informal alliance in the province. Alfonsín also supported the <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> of Buenos Aires that allowed Duhalde to run for re-election.|$|E

She broke with her party in favoring an anti-busing <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution.</b> She supported deployment of the PershingII missile and the Trident submarine, although she opposed funding for the MX missile, the B-1B bomber, and the Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E

5|$|Liaquat Ali Khan, {{appointed}} {{as the first}} prime minister by the Governor-General in 1947, was assassinated in 1951. Six further prime ministers served between 1951 and 1958, when the office was dissolved by Iskander Mirza, the President of Pakistan. A later president, Yahya Khan, appointed Nurul Amin as prime minister in 1971, although Amin held the post for only thirteen days. Under the 1973 constitution of Pakistan, the post was recreated and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto became prime minister. Bhutto was overthrown by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq during Operation Fair Play in 1977, the position was abolished and Zia became Chief Martial Law Administrator. Muhammad Khan Junejo was {{appointed as}} prime minister by Zia in 1985, and subsequently dismissed under the Eighth <b>Amendment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> of Pakistan in 1988.|$|E

A {{few weeks before the}} war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution. Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution.|$|E

One other charge included publishing letters written by the poet Joel Barlow, which Lyon had read at political rallies. These also were published prior to the Acts. Lyon's defense {{was to be the}} unconstitutionality of the Acts, as Jeffersonians saw them as violating the First <b>Amendment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution.</b> In Lyon's particular case, there was the aforementioned letter to Alden Spooner {{as well as that of}} Barlow, which meant Lyon felt entitled to bring up the Constitution's safeguards against ex post facto laws.

Jackie Washington had attempted to call his co-defendant as a witness, but was blocked by Texas courts because state law prevented co-defendants from testifying for each other, under the theory that they would be likely to lie for each other on the stand.|$|E
5|$|Afroyim v. Rusk, , {{is a major}} United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court ruled that {{citizens}} of the United States may not be deprived of their citizenship involuntarily. The U.S. government had attempted to revoke the citizenship of Beys Afroyim, a man born in Poland, because he had cast a vote in an Israeli election after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen. The Supreme Court decided that Afroyim's right to retain his citizenship was guaranteed by the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth <b>Amendment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution.</b> In so doing, the Court struck down a federal law mandating loss of U.S. citizenship for voting in a foreign election—thereby overruling one of its own precedents, Perez v. Brownell (1958), in which it had upheld loss of citizenship under similar circumstances less than a decade earlier.|$|E
5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E
