5|$|The {{smoke and}} <b>airborne</b> <b>particulates</b> from the fires posed {{a threat to}} local {{communities}} on several occasions. Smoke and particulates were especially high in Gardiner, Montana. There, monitoring stations maintained by the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences and the park recorded 19 days where recommended allowable particulate concentrations were exceeded. This was also the case near fires, and on 7 occasions at Mammoth, Montana, {{the location of the}} park headquarters. In no other surrounding communities were particulates found to be above acceptable levels. Smoke and haze made driving difficult and sometimes even dangerous. A number of fire fighters were treated at clinics for smoke and dust inhalation and a few for inadvertently inhaling fumes from a sulfur ignition near one of the geothermal areas.|$|E
5|$|During mid-summer (July in the {{northern}} hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads {{to an increase in}} red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of <b>airborne</b> <b>particulates.</b> Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{document}} cytogenetic damage associated with air pollution and, possibly, with health {{effects in the}} city of Catania, Sicily (Italy), we analyzed the induction of chromosomal aberrations by extractable agents from <b>airborne</b> <b>particulate</b> matter in a Chinese hamster epithelial liver (CHEL) cells. These cells retain their metabolic competence to activate different classes of promutagens/procarcinogens into biologically active metabolites. <b>Airborne</b> <b>particulate</b> matter was obtained from two stationary samplers (stations I and II) in two areas endowed by an elevated car transit in the centre of Catania. The results obtained clearly indicated that <b>airborne</b> <b>particulate</b> matter from both stations I and II proved to be clastogens in CHEL cells but not in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells without metabolic activation, indicating that <b>airborne</b> <b>particulate</b> mixtures need to be metabolically converted before exerting their genotoxic potential. On the basis of these results we can assert that the test system employed to identify the cytogenetic potential of <b>airborne</b> <b>particulate</b> matter is useful and profitable for environmental control, and helpful to plan specific actions aimed at reducing the hazards derived from exposure to polluted air.

25|$|The IARC and WHO {{designate}} <b>airborne</b> <b>particulates</b> a Group 1 carcinogen.

The smaller PM2.5 were particularly deadly, with a 36% increase in lung cancer per 10 μg/m3 as it can penetrate deeper into the lungs.|$|E
