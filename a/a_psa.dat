40|$|Context: We {{addressed}} {{the question whether}} the change of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in men who use 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor (5 -ARI) dutasteride is sensitive {{for the detection of}} aggressive prostate cancer (PCa). Objective: The case of a man using dutasteride diagnosed with Gleason 7 transition zone cancer at biopsy indicated by <b>a</b> rising <b>PSA</b> is described. The following issues are discussed: (1) Is <b>a</b> rise of <b>PSA</b> in patients using dutasteride predictive of aggressive PCa in men with prior negative biopsies? (2) Is it safe not to biopsy men using dutasteride who do not show <b>a</b> rising <b>PSA?</b> (3) How can we avoid potentially unnecessary biopsies in men using dutasteride without <b>a</b> rising <b>PSA?</b> Evidence acquisition: We reviewed the recent literature addressing our objective that relates to two studies: the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial and the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events trial. Evidence synthesis: In men using dutasteride, the positive predictive value/detection rate of Gleason 7 - 10 PCa is 13. 2 % and 4. 0 % for men with and without <b>a</b> rising <b>PSA,</b> respectively. However, <b>a</b> substantial proportion of Gleason 7 - 10 cases (42. 9 %) would be missed if <b>a</b> rising <b>PSA</b> was used as the only biopsy indication. Currently available data do not provide selective mechanisms to diagnose these cancers. Conclusions: <b>A</b> rising <b>PSA</b> for <b>a</b> patient using dutasteride should be an indication for prostate biopsies. Currently, in the case of stable <b>PSA</b> <b>a</b> biopsy may still be considered. Options for a selective approach are therefore suggested in this review to avoid unnecessary biopsies and to achieve a more selective PCa detection in men on 5 -ARI treatment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{benefits}} {{of prostate cancer}} screening on an individual level remain unevaluated. METHODS: Between 1993 and 1999, a total of 43, 987 men, aged 55 - 74 years, {{were included in the}} intervention arm of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) section in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Finland. A total of 42, 503 men, aged 55 - 74 years, were included in a clinical population in Northern Ireland. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 20. 0 ng/mL was measured in all men at study entry. All men were followed for prostate cancer incidence and causes of death until December 31, 2006. RESULTS: The adjusted absolute difference in prostate cancer specific mortality between the intervention population and the clinical population increased with increasing PSA level at study entry, ie, 0. 05 per 10, 000 person-years for men who had <b>a</b> serum <b>PSA</b> level of 0. 0 - 1. 9 ng/mL and 8. 8 per 10, 000 person-years for men who had <b>a</b> serum <b>PSA</b> level of 10 - 19. 9 ng/mL. To evaluate the risks of early detection, the number needed to investigate (NNI) and number needed to treat (NNT) to save 1 death from prostate cancer were calculated. Both NNI and NNT were higher for those who had lower PSA levels at study entry. The NNI was 24, 642 men for patients who had <b>a</b> serum <b>PSA</b> level of 0. 0 - 1. 9 ng/mL and was 133 men for patients who had <b>a</b> serum <b>PSA</b> level of 10 - 19. 9 ng/mL; the NNT was 724 men for patients who had <b>a</b> serum <b>PSA</b> level of 0. 0 - 1. 9 ng/mL and was 60 men for patients with <b>a</b> serum <b>PSA</b> level of 10 - 19. 9 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: For men with <b>a</b> low serum <b>PSA</b> level, the {{benefits of}} aggressive investigation and treatment may be limited because they are associated with a large increase in cumulative incidence and potential overtreatment...|$|R

25|$|Urinalysis is {{typically}} performed when LUTS are present and BPH is suspected to evaluate {{for signs of}} a urinary tract infection, glucose in the urine (suggestive of diabetes), or protein in the urine (suggestive of kidney disease). Bloodwork including kidney function tests and prostate specific antigen (PSA) are often ordered to evaluate for kidney damage and prostate cancer, respectively. However, checking blood PSA levels for prostate cancer screening is controversial and not necessarily indicated in every evaluation for BPH. Benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are both capable of increasing blood PSA levels and PSA elevation is unable to differentiate these two conditions well. If PSA levels are checked and are high, then further investigation is warranted. Measures including PSA density, free PSA, rectal examination, and transrectal ultrasonography may be helpful in determining whether <b>a</b> <b>PSA</b> increase is due to BPH or prostate cancer. Ultrasound examination of the testes, prostate, and kidneys is often performed, again to rule out cancer and hydronephrosis.|$|E
