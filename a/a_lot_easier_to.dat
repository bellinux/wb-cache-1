5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} album, Room Service, significant portions of the album were produced while on tour. According to co-writer Jim Vallance modern technology and equipment made it <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> record the album. Adams recorded the album while on tour, making use of the time between playing on stage and readying himself for the next gig. Vallance and Adams recorded the album normally while sitting backstage or in an hotel room with small devices which they usually carried along on tours, but especially during their off days. Adams, in an interview, mentioned that when recording a song, they needed to set up mattresses against the windows, and having microphones run through the toilet.|$|E

And for some of his memories of his son’s accident, these grainy black-and-white stills... have a feel that contrasted very beautifully with the crisp hi-def HD that we shot.

500|$|Diary of a Camper and {{the films}} that it {{inspired}} were initially called [...] "Quake movies"; the term machinima was later coined in 1998, {{in response to}} the increasing use of other game engines. There was initial hesitance to retroactively label Diary of a Camper the first machinima piece; a Machinima.com article from February 2000 opened, [...] "It's kinda hard to pin down the first Machinima: things like the Doom speedruns, the Stunt Island stuff and the Demo Scene all compete for the title. However, it's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> pin down the first piece of film made in a 3D game engine: Diary Of A Camper". Marino states that the AMAS carefully defined machinima in 2002 as [...] "animated filmmaking within a real-time virtual 3-D environment" [...] to separate machinima from its creative lineage. Separating machinima from the demoscene and earlier demo recordings, he defines Diary of a Camper as the first machinima work. Lowood also contrasts the film with earlier recordings of [...] "documented gameplay".|$|E

Jonnie Cook of Sinclair User described the arcade release as enjoyable to those that already liked the genre, but stated he preferred other games. Killer List of Videogames called the cabinet design [...] "quite unique". In March 1992, Gary Whitta of Advanced Computer Entertainment magazine stated that the sections that scroll into the screen are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> play than the horizontally scrolling sections. The screen can quickly fill up with enemies, which can lead to confusion as to what the player is shooting at, especially when human hostages run across the screen as they can be inadvertently killed. Neil West of Amiga Format commented that the title has a high difficulty level and that power-ups are a necessity to continue playing. The [...] "not perfect" [...] rapid fire weapon (which needs recharging after prolonged use) contributes to the game's difficulty, as stated by Brian Sharp of Games-X magazine.|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} Countdown to Extinction {{was written in}} two {{different}} sessions. The first session was done following the conclusion of Clash of the Titans tour, while the second session took place after a one-month break, {{in the fall of}} 1991. The album was recorded {{in the first half of}} 1992, when the Rodney King Riots took place. These events negatively affected the recording process, as the band was forced to leave the studio every night at six o'clock because of the enacted curfew. Dave Mustaine shared his experience: [...] "There’s nothing worse than getting a creative moment and you have to leave. It was like a school bell ringing." [...] The record was produced by Mustaine and Max Norman at The Enterprise in Burbank, California, while the mixing was handed by Norman with the help of Fred Kelly. Referring to the recording process, Mustaine said that Countdown to Extinction [...] "was one of those records where everything was firing on all 12 cylinders and you just know it". He also said that it didn't take the band a long time to record the album because [...] "records were <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> make back then because the pressure wasn't quite as hard".|$|E

500|$|The {{proprietary}} Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was overhauled for {{the game}} to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities, and the Euphoria and Bullet engines handle further animation and environment rendering tasks. The team found they could render the game world with greater detail than in Grand Theft Auto IV because they had {{become familiar with the}} PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360's hardware. Art director Aaron Garbut said that while the consoles' ageing hardware were tiring to work with, the team could still render detailed lighting and shadows and [...] "maintain a consistent look". Vice president Dan Houser agreed and felt that working on Grand Theft Auto IV with relatively new hardware was a challenge, but added [...] "now we know what the hardware's capable of, so it's become <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> move things along and a lot more fun, too". The PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions fit onto one Blu-Ray Disc; Xbox 360 copies are distributed on two DVD discs and require an 8 GB installation on the HDD or external storage device; while the Microsoft Windows (PC) version takes up seven DVD disks. The team asserted that any differences between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions would be negligible.|$|E
500|$|On Stranger Tides {{also had}} {{positive}} reviews; some critics found {{the film to}} be entertaining and well-made. Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, describing it as [...] "the most fun installment since the first", calling the story [...] "pure cartoon, but <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> follow than the other sequels", and summing as [...] "the franchise is getting tired, but Penelope energizes it." [...] Along the same lines, Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, writing that it [...] "feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first swashed his buckle, infusing new reckless energy into a franchise that shows no signs of furling its sails". She said that Marshall [...] "swiftly and without fuss delivers the action set pieces and eye-popping escapism" [...] and praised Depp, Cruz, and McShane's performances. Ray Bennett from The Hollywood Reporter considered that Marshall [...] "shows terrific flair with all the usual chases and sword fights, and he handles the 3D well", and welcomed Penélope Cruz's character, saying she [...] "brings her Oscar-winning vivacity" [...] and had [...] "lively sexual tension" [...] with Depp. Writing for The Globe and Mail, Rick Groen found the action scenes to range from [...] "merely competent to tritely cluttered", but he was pleased with the overall result, calling McShane a [...] "fresh villain" [...] whose [...] "stentorian tones are welcome anywhere". Variety's Andrew Barker considered the film derivative, but accessible. [...] "It has nary an original idea and still doesn't make much sense, but it's lost all pretensions that it should". He praised Geoffrey Rush, stating that he [...] "not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots, but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depp's stock and trade." ...|$|E

[...] Kyle MacGregor for Destructoid enjoyed the gameplay as [...] "a heady, engrossing experience" [...] yet was critical of the enemy turns having a protracted length, being [...] "hellaciously long".

50|$|The {{synchronous}} abstraction makes reasoning {{about time}} in a synchronous program <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier,</b> thanks <b>to</b> the notion of logical ticks: a synchronous program reacts to its environment in a sequence of ticks, and computations within a tick {{are assumed to be}} instantaneous, i.e., as if the processor executing them were infinitely fast. The statement “a||b” is therefore abstracted as the package “ab” where “a” and “b” are simultaneous. To take a concrete example, the Esterel statement “every 60 second emit minute” specifies that the signal “minute” is exactly synchronous with the 60-th occurrence of the signal “second”. At a more fundamental level, the synchronous abstraction eliminates the non-determinism resulting from the interleaving of concurrent behaviors. This allows deterministic semantics, therefore making synchronous programs amenable to formal analysis, verification and certified code generation, and usable as formal specification formalisms.|$|R
2500|$|Campaign finance expert Jan Baran, {{a member}} of the Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform, agreed with the decision, writing that [...] "The history of {{campaign}} finance reform is the history of incumbent politicians seeking to muzzle speakers, any speakers, particularly those who might publicly criticize them and their legislation.

[...] Baran further noted that in general conservatives and libertarians praised the ruling's preservation of the First Amendment and freedom of speech, but that liberals and campaign finance reformers criticized it as greatly expanding the role of corporate money in politics.|$|E

2500|$|Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times said, [...] "By {{trying so}} hard for authenticity, this Doctor Zhivago drains the story of much of its lyricism.... Mr. Lean's grander, glossier version was a closer match to the romantic spirit of the novel's hero.... The Davies version is engrossing but more for the {{harrowing}} scenes set {{in the civil war}} after the revolution than for the novel's legendary love triangle. Black-and-white archival photographs - Moscow slums, newspaper shots of soldiers marching off to World War I - are interspersed throughout the film and slowly bleed into a scene of the television show. The visual trick gives the series a quasi-documentary feel and is quite effective. Yet Mr. Davies takes the same liberties with Pasternak's text as the original film did, focusing on the love story and discarding a lot of the politics, secondary plots and literary sidetracks.... This Doctor Zhivago can be watched as a useful history lesson and as a cautionary show business tale: it is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> adapt a Jane Austen novel than it is to remake a film by David Lean." ...|$|E

40|$|There are ever-more, ever-larger {{research}} universities across the world. These, though,are characterised by waning conceptual vigour and creativity. More, it turns out, means less. There is strong empirical evidence for this, which the paper elaborates. The {{decline in the}} short-run extends from the late 1980 s. In a much more sweeping historical sense, it extends from the late 1920 s. It affects both {{the arts and the}} sciences. Having reviewed the empirical indicators of decline, which are striking, the paper goes on to explore the more testing question of what it is that explains the decline. It briefly reviews the larger social conditions for high-level creativity. It suggests a number of key factors that stimulate and deflate the collective social imagination. What this supposes is that the creative power of societies, and key institutions, including universities, waxes and wanes over time. It is cyclical. While the expressions of this are different in different national settings the outcome is much the same across the board when we focus on high-level creation. This means that, in truth, our era is not a very interesting one. This is so no matter how much money is spent on universities and no matter how many students they enrol and no matter how many PhDs are produced. To offset this narrative of decline, the paper sets out a model of the causes of creative surges in the arts and sciences. The paper discusses the central role that objection-creation and paradox play in this. We know when the collective imagination is roused. The desire for object-creation is widespread. This is accompanied by a pervasive love of form, pattern and figure and the correlated command of irony, metaphor and apposition. Societies and eras that master such media of imagination on a large scale exhibit a high degree of inventiveness in the arts and sciences, a formidable scale of innovation and entrepreneurialism in business, and produce ingenious models of social prosperity. The paper asks what kind of university would fit into this picture. The answer is a university that is dominated by an ethos of objection-creation rather than one of dissemination. As the paper suggests, that is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> say than to achieve...|$|R
