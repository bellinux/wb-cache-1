5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi lays a {{continuous}} dragline of silk as it moves, {{and from time to}} time anchors the dragline to a surface with <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> sticky silk. This allows the spider to return to the surface if the animal is dislodged. A spider about to jump first lays a sticky silk anchor, and then lays out a dragline as it flies. Unlike those of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s draglines stick to each other and, when a P. schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as it moves.|$|E
5|$|Sue Ellen {{has become}} a {{powerful}} woman in Dallas, leading successful fundraising campaigns and making connections with influential Texans. Her success has led her to run for Governor of Texas, with campaign backers already lining up to support her. But despite this success, Sue Ellen harbors deep regret for her mistakes as a mother raising John Ross and {{will do anything to}} make things right for him. Upon seeing J.R. {{for the first time in}} years, there is a brief moment of romantic tension and nostalgia. However, Sue Ellen becomes wary of J.R.'s claims of having changed when Cliff Barnes returns to town. Then when a colleague and occasional lover of John Ross's, Veronica Martinez, is pushed off a balcony and killed, Sue Ellen bribes the medical examiner into ruling the death a suicide and finds herself looking for support from Harris Ryland, Ann's ex-husband. Harris later plans to use Sue Ellen's sure win to his advantage and desiring to run a clean office, Sue Ellen seeks Ann's help who later gets a recording of Harris admitting to his crimes and placing him into <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> submission.|$|E

25|$|We {{would often}} cross the broad avenue with the martial {{sounding}} name... The one that separated Courbevoie from Puteaux.

We returned there often and soon we were spending our Sunday afternoons not merely conversing about aesthetic novelties but rather kicking a ball around or indulging in <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> archery.|$|E
25|$|No batsman reached 50 in the Bermudian innings, but solid {{contributions}} from Brown (48), Blades (45) and Douglas (36) guided {{them to a}} reasonable 231/8 from their 60 overs. Duncan Fletcher was the pick of the Zimbabwean bowlers with 3-34 from nine overs. Zimbabwe looked in <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> bother at 30/2 with both openers gone, but the match and the Trophy were decided by half-centuries from Andy Pycroft, who made 82, and Craig Hodgson (57 not out); the Africans won with more than five overs to play with.|$|E
25|$|In reply, Durham were in <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> bother at 146 for 6, but a {{partnership}} worth 126 between Gareth Breese and Philip Mustard lifted Durham to 316. With a 62-run deficit on first innings, Yorkshire lost their first seven wickets for only 128 runs, but Anthony McGrath hit a potentially match-saving 133 not out – his second important century of the season, following his 165 not out against Leicestershire a week earlier. He {{was supported by}} Chris Silverwood, who smashed 80 off 66 balls before eventually being bowled by Michael Lewis, who removed the five last batsmen in his five for 80.|$|E

25|$|Prince of Persia {{features}} open world exploration {{that allows}} the player to travel to any spot in the game world at any given point, and allows the player to witness the plot in any way they want. Depending on how the player progresses, previously visited areas will become more challenging to traverse when the player re-visits them. However, when the player heals <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> land, it becomes devoid of traps. The traps are manifested in various forms of the antagonist Ahriman's Corruption; black-colored blobs that coat the land and swallow the player if touched. The player can use acrobatic maneuvers to avoid these traps.|$|E
25|$|Parker is a voiceover {{artist and}} has done work on audiobooks, {{including}} Eoin Colfer's children's Artemis Fowl series, the first three books in Charlie Higson's Young James Bond series, and The Gardens of The Dead by William Brodrick.

25|$|England started {{positively}} in reply, taking 39 off {{the first}} 34 legal deliveries (while Gillespie served up four wides and a no-ball in his first over), but Glenn McGrath took revenge by serving up a good yorker to have Marcus Trescothick bowled for 16. Two overs later, Andrew Strauss went in identical fashion, and Vaughan and Collingwood were forced to consolidate. They did, although in jerky fashion, Collingwood eventually falling to Kasprowicz and Flintoff mistiming a hit off Hogg to see England into <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> bother at 119 for 4 after 27.2 overs, with Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen at the crease. Edges and runs followed, but when England lost Vaughan and Geraint Jones in quick succession, and were 93 short with only 74 deliveries left, it looked dark for England. Pietersen then upped the ante. Smashing runs to all corners, especially off Gillespie, he reached his fifty off 46 balls, and then took 19 more deliveries to bring up an additional 41 runs – although surviving an extremely close run-out decision near the 40th over. A level headed 7 not out from Lewis – making up somewhat for his bowling – ensured the English were home by three wickets and 15 deliveries – and the Australians had only managed two points from their first two matches, while England had gained 11.|$|E

500|$|Another {{approach}} applies {{specifically to}} the study of self-awareness, that is, the ability to distinguish oneself from others. [...] In the 1970s Gordon Gallup developed an operational test for self-awareness, known as the mirror test. [...] The test examines whether animals are able to differentiate between seeing themselves in a mirror versus seeing other animals. The classic example involves placing <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> coloring on the skin or fur near the individual's forehead and seeing if they attempt to remove it or at least touch the spot, thus indicating that they recognize that the individual they are seeing in the mirror is themselves. [...] Humans (older than 18 months) and other great apes, bottlenose dolphins, killer whales, pigeons, European magpies and elephants have all been observed to pass this test.|$|E
500|$|On 30 January 1972 Lee's first wife, Gladys Merredew, {{died in a}} fire {{at their}} seventeenth-century home in Oare, Kent which also left Lee hospitalised. According to actor Jack Warner, [...] "Bernard and Gladys had a lovely seventeenth-century cottage in the Kent village of Oare, {{and it was there}} she died tragically in a fire early in 1972. Bernard and Gladys were trapped in their bedroom when the fire started on the ground floor. Bernard escaped through a window and ran to get a ladder in an attempt to rescue Gladys, but unhappily was unsuccessful. It was an awful end to a long and happy marriage." [...] In February 1972 Lee was mugged and robbed by two youths. After the mugging and fire, Lee turned to drink, [...] By chance Lee met Richard Burton in a pub, who, upon hearing of Lee's problems, gave him a cheque for $6,000 {{together}} with a note saying that everyone has <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> trouble once in a while.

In 1975 both Lee and Lois Maxwell accepted roles in their usual Bond characters in the poorly received French James Bond spoof, From Hong Kong with Love.|$|E
