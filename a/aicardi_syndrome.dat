In particular, the miR- 219 transfection increased astrocyte viability, growth, and differentiation while decreasing cell necrosis and apoptosis.

40|$|Background <b>Aicardi</b> Goutières <b>Syndrome</b> (AGS) is a {{heritable}} interferonopathy {{associated with}} systemic autoinflammation causing interferon (IFN) elevation, {{central nervous system}} calcifications, leukodystrophy and severe neurologic sequelae. An infant with TREX 1 mutations was recently found to have abnormal C 26 : 0 lysophosphatidylcholine (C 26 : 0 Lyso-PC) in a newborn screening platform for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, prompting analysis of this analyte in retrospectively collected samples from individuals affected by AGS. Methods In this study, we explored C 26 : 0 Lyso-PC levels and IFN signatures in newborn blood spots and post-natal blood samples in 19 children with a molecular and clinical diagnosis of AGS and in the blood spots of 22 healthy newborns. We used Nanostring nCounter™ for IFN-induced gene analysis and a high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS) newborn screening platform for C 26 : 0 Lyso-PC analysis. Results Newborn screening cards from patients across six AGS associated genes were collected, with a median disease presentation of 2 months. Thirteen out of 19 (68 %) children with AGS had elevations of first tier C 26 : 0 Lyso-PC (> 0. 4 μM), that {{would have resulted in}} a second screen being performed in a two tier screening system for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). The median (95 %CI) of first tier C 26 : 0 Lyso-PC values in AGS individuals (0. 43 μM [0. 37 – 0. 48]) was higher than that seen in controls (0. 21 μM [0. 21 – 0. 21]), but lower than X-ALD individuals (0. 72 μM [0. 59 – 0. 84]) (p < 0. 001). Fourteen of 19 children had elevated expression of IFN signaling on blood cards relative to controls (Sensitivity 73. 7 %, 95 %CI 51 – 88 %, Specificity 95 %, 95 % CI 78 – 99 %) including an individual with delayed disease presentation (36 months of age). All five AGS patients with negative IFN signature at birth had RNASEH 2 B mutations. Consistency of agreement between IFN signature in neonatal and post-natal samples was high (0. 85). Conclusion This suggests that inflammatory markers in AGS can be identified in the newborn period, before symptom onset. Additionally, since C 26 : 0 Lyso-PC screening is currently used in X-ALD newborn screening panels, clinicians should be alert to the fact that AGS infants may present as false positives during X-ALD screening...|$|R
40|$|The {{adenosine}} deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes catalyse the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in double stranded (ds) RNA. Mutations in ADAR 1 underlie the autoimmune disorder <b>Aicardi</b> Goutiѐres <b>syndrome</b> (AGS). Patients with AGS display heightened levels of type I interferon (IFN) and IFN stimulated genes (ISGs). The first aim of my thesis {{was to determine}} whether the mutations found in the human ADAR 1 gene affected RNA editing. I found that the ADAR 1 mutants identified in the AGS patients have reduced editing activity. Interestingly, the mutations have a greater effect on the IFN-inducible cytoplasmic isoform, ADAR 1 p 150 than on the constitutive ADAR 1 p 110 isoform. These results imply that A-to-I editing plays a role in regulating the type I IFN response. The Adar 1 null mouse dies by E 12. 5 with a type I IFN signature similar to that observed in the AGS patients. The second aim of my thesis was to characterize the immune signalling pathway aberrantly activated in the absence of Adar 1. A colleague in our research group rescued the Adar 1 null mouse to birth by blocking the cellular response to cytoplasmic dsRNA by generating a double mutant with the mitochondrial antiviral signalling adaptor, Mavs. In the Adar 1 -/-; Mavs-/- mutant I found that the aberrant immune response is rescued at E 11. 5. This indicates that MAVS is the downstream adaptor in the aberrant immune response that underlies the embryonic lethality in the Adar 1 -/- mouse. The third aim of my thesis was to determine if the lack of inosine modification within cellular RNA was triggering the aberrant immune response in the Adar 1 -/- mouse. To study this, Adar 1 -/-; p 53 -/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated. By reintroducing various ADAR isoforms into the Adar 1 -/-; p 53 -/- MEFs I found that to rescue the aberrant immune response requires both catalytic activity and the location of an ADAR protein within the cytoplasm. Moreover, I demonstrated that transfecting inosine-containing dsRNA oligonucleotides into Adar 1 -/-; p 53 -/- MEFs suppresses the aberrant immune response. Overall my results suggest that A-to-I editing by ADAR 1 is an essential RNA modification that is required by the cell to distinguish between ‘self’ and ‘non-self’ RNA. Editing of cellular RNAs prevents an autoimmune response whereas editing of viral RNA may act to suppress a heightened antiviral immune response and prevent long-term damage to the cell...|$|R

40|$|Extremes {{of brain}} growth have {{frequently}} {{been associated with}} impaired neurodevelopment and cognition. A significant contribution {{to our understanding of}} the processes involved in brain development has been made by the study of single gene disorders which are rare in the general population, but occur with increased frequency in certain endogamous populations. This project stems from findings of a long-running clinical-genetic program, called ‘Windows of Hope’, based amongst the Amish. The project aims were to clinically characterise three new autosomal recessive disorders of brain growth and development, to define the genes and mutations responsible for each, and to investigate the function of the molecules identified. A final further objective of the project in keeping with the wider aims of the Windows of Hope study was to translate the findings of this research into direct clinical benefits to the families and community involved. A combination of clinical phenotyping, autozygosity and linkage mapping, and functional studies, were used to investigate each disorder, which enabled the identification of the novel disease genes in each case. Chapter three describes the identification of a hypomorphic mutation in PCNA responsible for a novel DNA repair disorder. Thus, although it was considered by many that mutations in PCNA would not be compatible with life due to its crucial role in genomic stability and cell division, this study disproves this notion and describes a molecular ‘missing piece’ in DNA repair spectrum disorders. While the relationship between pervasive developmental disorders and megalencephaly is well described, very few single gene disorders associated with this clinical relationship have been identified. Chapter four documents the discovery of two founder mutations in the KPTN gene associated with such a phenotype. The functional data shows that the encoded wild type molecule (kaptin) associates with dynamic actin cytoskeletal structures in cultured neurons and that the causative mutations result in loss of function perturbing this interaction, defining kaptin as a new molecule which is crucial for normal human brain development and function. Chapter five details the investigation of the eponymously named “Hershberger syndrome”, a disorder originally described by McKusick in the Ohio Amish in 1967. Clinical and genetic studies of affected individuals revealed that the syndrome was comprised of two distinct disorders; <b>Aicardi</b> Goutières <b>syndrome</b> due to mutation in SAMHD 1, and a new condition characterised by profound neurological impairment, cerebellar involvement and nephrosis. This condition, renamed “nephrocerebellar syndrome” was found to be caused by homozygous mutations in two closely linked genes, WHAMM and WDR 73. The genetic and functional data supported the involvement of both molecules in the disease, suggesting that this is a composite phenotype. The identification and functional characterisation of three new genes responsible for abnormalities in brain growth provides an invaluable insight into disease pathogenesis and also identifies molecular pathways important for normal brain development. This is turn enables clinicians to provide a much needed diagnosis for affected individuals and their families as well as the wider community.  Medical Research CouncilNewlife Foundation for Disabled Childre...|$|R

METHODS: Fourteen patients with <b>Aicardi</b> <b>syndrome,</b> all examined and followed by the same ophthalmologist, were reviewed between 1975 and 1992 and their ocular characteristics and visual acuity described. It was hypothesised that larger lacunae may be associated with poorer clinical outcome and therefore the relation between these two variables was investigated. RESULTS: Visual acuity as documented by Snellen, Sheridan-Gardner, preferential looking, or pattern visual evoked potential tests was in the normal to low normal range in six eyes of four patients. Visual function correlated significantly with macular appearance. Good visual function was preserved if the fovea appeared normal on funduscopic examination and was uninvolved by lacunae. The size of the largest chorioretinal lacuna also correlated significantly with clinical outcome: patients with large lacunae {{were more likely to be}} immobile and to have no language skills.
