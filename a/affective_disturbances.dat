5000|$|Cancer {{pain can}} be {{associated}} with continuing tissue damage due to the disease process or the treatment (i.e. surgery, radiation, chemotherapy). Although there is always a role for environmental factors and <b>affective</b> <b>disturbances</b> in the genesis of pain behaviors, these are not usually the predominant etiologic factors in patients with cancer pain. Some patients with severe pain associated with cancer are nearing the end of their lives, but in all cases palliative therapies should be used to control the pain. Issues such as social stigma of using opioids, work and functional status, and health care consumption can be concerns and may need to be addressed in order for the person to feel comfortable taking the medications required to control his or her symptoms. The typical strategy for cancer pain management is to get the patient as comfortable as possible using the least amount of medications possible but opioids, surgery, and physical measures are often required. In the past doctors have been reluctant to prescribe narcotics for pain in terminal cancer patients, for fear of contributing to addiction or suppressing respiratory function. The palliative care movement, a more recent offshoot of the hospice movement, has engendered more widespread support for preemptive pain treatment for cancer patients. The World Health Organization also noted uncontrolled cancer pain as a worldwide problem and established a [...] "ladder" [...] as a guideline for how practitioners should treat pain in patients who have cancer ...|$|E

40|$|Several {{integrated}} {{models of}} psychosis have implicated adverse, stressful contexts and experiences, and affective and cognitive {{processes in the}} onset of psychosis. In these models, the effects of stress are posited {{to contribute to the}} development of psychotic experiences via pathways through <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance,</b> cognitive biases, and anomalous experiences. However, attempts to systematically test comprehensive models of these pathways remain sparse. Using the Experience Sampling Method in 51 individuals with first-episode psychosis (FEP), 46 individuals with an atrisk mental state (ARMS) for psychosis, and 53 controls, we investigated how stress, enhanced threat anticipation, and experiences of aberrant salience combine to increase the intensity of psychotic experiences. We fitted multilevel moderated mediation models to investigate indirect effects across these groups. We found that the effects of stress on psychotic experiences were mediated via pathways through <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance</b> in all 3 groups. The effect of stress on psychotic experiences was mediated by threat anticipation in FEP individuals and controls but not in ARMS individuals. There was only weak evidence of mediation via aberrant salience. However, aberrant salience retained a substantial direct effect on psychotic experiences, independently of stress, in all 3 groups. Our findings provide novel insights on the role of <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance</b> and threat anticipation in pathways through which stress impacts on the formation of psychotic experiences across different stages of early psychosis in daily life...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to examine the}} <b>affective</b> and {{cognitive}} <b>disturbance</b> associated with weight-loss dieting. We were particularly interested in how mood might interact with dietary restraint to produce cognitive deficit. Initially dieting was investigated in a community sample of overweight dieters. Affect was assessed by self-reported feelings of positive and negative mood (PANAS) and general psychological well-being (Ryff s PWB). Cognitive performance was assessed using a battery of computer administered tasks that measured speed to respond to a target stimulus; immediate memory recall; working memory capacity; vigilance (Bakan task); attentional distraction for food related stimuli (Stroop task); and, preference for food and body-shape related stimuli (Implicit Association Test). In replication of previous studies (e. g. Green, Rogers, Elliman, & Gatenby, 1994), dieting was found to be related to cognitive deficit. The same dieters were also found to be more neurotic and to have greater levels of <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance</b> compared to non-dieters. Contrary to expectation, restraint per se could not account for the dieter-non-dieter differences found. Further, differences in cognitive performance could not be explained as directly due to dieter-non-dieter differences in BMI, hunger, preoccupation, attentional bias or mood. Rather, it was the tendency to eat when emotional which best identified those dieters most vulnerable to cognitive and <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Further investigation revealed that under conditions of high negative mood, tendency towards emotional eating was associated with an increase in preference for food related stimuli, and a decrease in attentional capacity. Accordingly, it was proposed that under dieting conditions, where opportunity for <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance</b> is increased, cognitive deficit is most likely to occur in the high emotional eater because they are highly sensitive to <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance,</b> and for them such disturbance results in preferential allocation of attentional resources to food and eating related cognitions. Further research is needed to fully examine the psychological profile of the individual with high tendency towards emotional eating. This issue is of particular importance given the additional finding that the tendency to consume when emotional is not context-bound but can also be observed in other behavioural domains, such as "emotional spending" on other consumer goods...|$|R

40|$|Depression {{is a major}} {{mental health}} problem for women. Several lines of {{evidence}} suggest that fluctuating levels of estrogen associated with various reproductive events are related to changes in mood. It has been hypothesized that estrogen may exert its influence on mood via {{its effect on the}} serotonergic system [...] -a system frequently implicated in the regulation of mood. The major goal of the following study was to elucidate further the role of estrogen in mood regulation. To this end, we examined the role of estrogen in the mood-lowering effect of Acute Tryptohpan Deption (ATD), a technique designed to cause a marked lowering of plasma and brain tryptophan, and therefore brain serotonin levels, so that the effects of decreased serotonin on mood can be studied directly. We hypothesized that (1) exogenous estrogen may protect against the mood-lowering effects of ATD in postmenopausal women and that (2) a history of <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance,</b> particularly reproduction-related <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance,</b> would be associated with greater vulnerability to ATD as predicted by the kindling model of depression. Fifty-eight postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to treatment with estrogen (0. 625 mg Premarin) or placebo in the context of prospective, double-blind, cross-over design. During the final two week sof the 12 -week treatment phase, all participants completed one ATD test session and one nutritionally balanced amino acid control session. We found that: (1) treatment with exogenous estrogen significantly improved mood and menopausal symptoms as compared to placebo treatment, (2) ATD was associated with a significant lowering of mood in both groups, (3) treatment with estrogen did not protect women from ATD effects unless they responded to 11 weeks of treatment with exogenous estrogen with enhanced mood, and (4) a history of reproduction-related <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance</b> was associated with more dysphoric mood in response to ATD.

40|$|The {{traditional}} view on cerebellar functioning {{has recently}} been challenged by results from neuroanatomical, neuroimaging and clinical studies. In this contribution, eighteen patients with primary cerebellar lesions (vascular: n= 13; neoplastic: n= 5) were systematically investigated {{by means of an}} extensive neuropsychological test battery. Fifteen patients (83 %) presented with a broad variety of cognitive and linguistic deficits following cerebellar damage. Disturbances of attention (72 %), executive functioning (50 %) and memory (50 %) were most commonly found. Analyses of our results tend to support the hypothesis of a lateralization of cognitive modulation within the cerebellum, the right cerebellar hemisphere being associated with logical reasoning and language processing and the left cerebellum mediating right-hemispheric functions including attentional and visuo-spatial skills. In addition, nine patients (50 %) presented with frontal-like behavioural and affective alterations. In an attempt to determine the working-mechanism underlying cerebellar-induced cognitive and <b>affective</b> <b>disturbances,</b> all patients were investigated by means of quantified Tc- 99 m-ethylenecysteine dimer (ECD) single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) studies. From a semiological point of view, damage to the cerebellum can cause a broad spectrum of clinically significant cognitive and <b>affective</b> <b>disturbances.</b> From a pathophysiological point of view, quantified SPECT data, reflecting the phenomenon of cerebello-cerebral diaschisis, support the functional impact of the cerebellar lesion on cortical functioning through disruption of cerebello-cerebral connections.

40|$|Introduction: Although a {{considerable}} amount of research has addressed psychopathological and personality correlates of creativity, the relationship between these characteristics and the phenomenology of creativity has been neglected. Relating these characteristics to the phenomenology of creativity may assist in clarifying the precise nature of the relationship between psychopathology and creativity. The current article reports on an empirical study {{of the relationship between the}} phenomenology of the creative process and psychopathological and personality characteristics in a sample of artists. Method: A total of 100 artists (43 males, 57 females, mean age[*]=[*] 34. 69 years) from a range of disciplines completed the Experience of Creativity Questionnaire and measures of “positive” schizotypy, <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance,</b> mental boundaries, and normal personality. Results: The sample of artists was found to be elevated on “positive” schizotypy, unipolar <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance,</b> thin boundaries, and the personality dimensions of Openness to Experience and Neuroticism, compared with norm data. Schizotypy was found to be the strongest predictor of a range of creative experience scales (Distinct Experience, Anxiety, Absorption, Power/Pleasure), suggesting a strong overlap of schizotypal and creative experience. Discussion: These findings indicate that “positive” schizotypy is associated with central features of “flow”-type experience, including distinct shift in phenomenological experience, deep absorption, focus on present experience, and sense of pleasure. The neurologically based construct of latent inhibition may be a mechanism that facilitates entry into flow-type states for schizotypal individuals. This may occur by reduced latent inhibition providing a “fresh” awareness and therefore a greater absorption in present experience, thus leading to flow-type states...|$|R

The relationship of demyelination (as detected by T 2 -weighted and gadolinium-enhanced T 1 -weighted MRI imaging), to both physical disability (as documented using the Expanded Disability Status Scale), and cognitive deterioration (as detected by neuropsychological assessment), was examined. Twelve individuals with early-stage relapsing-remitting MS underwent serial imaging, neurological examination, and neuropsychological assessment at both baseline and 6 month follow-up. Results revealed mild deterioration in functioning with respect to all four aspects of the subcortical dementia profile (i. e., attention and information processing speed, memory, executive functioning, and <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance).</b> Although no significant correlation was found between pathology and ratings of disability, pathology was found to correlate with cognitive functioning. Specifically, total lesion load predicted {{a significant amount of}} the variability in attention and executive functioning at baseline and follow-up, and in memory at baseline. Total lesion load was not significantly related to <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance.</b> No significant changes took place over time with respect to pathology, attention, memory, or affect. However, executive functioning improved to a mild degree.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that learned self-regulation of localized brain activity in deep limbic {{areas such as the}} amygdala, may alleviate symptoms of <b>affective</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Thus far self-regulation of amygdala activity could be obtained only via fMRI guided neurofeedback, an expensive and immobile procedure. EEG on the other hand is relatively inexpensive and can be easily implemented in any location. However the clinical utility of EEG neurofeedback for <b>affective</b> <b>disturbances</b> remains limited due to low spatial resolution, which hampers the targeting of deep limbic areas such as the amygdala. We introduce an EEG prediction model of amygdala activity from a single electrode. The gold standard used for training is the fMRI-BOLD signal in the amygdala during simultaneous EEG/fMRI recording. The suggested model is based on a time/frequency representation of the EEG data with varying time-delay. Previous work has shown a strong inhomogeneity among subjects as is reflected by the models created to predict the amygdala BOLD response from EEG data. In that work, different models were constructed for different subjects. In this work, we carefully analyzed the inhomogeneity among subjects and were able to construct a single model {{for the majority of the}} subjects. We introduce a method for inhomogeneity assessment. This enables us to demonstrate a choice of subjects for which a single model could be derived. We further demonstrate the ability to modulate brain-activity in a neurofeedback setting using feedback generated by the model. We tested the effect of the neurofeedback training by showing that new subjects can learn to down-regulate the signal amplitude compared to a sham group, which received a feedback obtained by a different participant. This EEG based model can overcome substantial limitations of fMRI-NF. It can enable investigation of NF training using multiple sessions and large samples in various locations...|$|E

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that impairs motor movement and is associated with cognitive and <b>affective</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Rodent models of PD demonstrate that complex environmental enrichment (CEE) can protect against motor dysfunction and improve neural survival in these dopaminergic-lesioned rodents. A few studies show that cognitive deficits {{can be observed in}} early-stage PD rats, but to date, no intervention has attempted to treat these induced deficits. Aim: In preparation for developing an early-stage PD rat model, this paper explored whether CEE could alleviate induced motor, cognitive or mood dysfunction as induced by the transient effects of dopamine antagonism on Sprague Dawley rats. Specifically, Study 1 (Chapter 2) explored whether brief CEE was effective in protecting against locomotor, memory or depressive symptoms in rats administered dopamine antagonists (either SCH 23390 or pimozide). Results demonstrated that CEE differentially protected against attenuation of spontaneous locomotor activity and improved motivated exploratory behaviour, of enriched rats challenged with the D₁ receptor antagonist SCH 23390, but did not prevent attenuation of sucrose consumption induced by the D₂ receptor antagonist pimozide. Study 2 (Chapter 3) explored whether memory or <b>affective</b> <b>disturbances</b> could be produced in an early-stage PD rat model, using 6 -OHDA to induce dopaminergic cell loss within the substantia nigra of the brain in aged rats. Neither memory nor anhedonic disturbances were evident in the early-stage PD rats. Subsequently, a CEE intervention was not introduced to these animals. Methodological alterations are discussed to improve both cognitive and affective testing of early-stage PD rats. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 1 online resource (xii, 125 pages) illustration...|$|E

This study was designed to investigate the relationship between symptoms of aging, anxiety, and depression, and to determine if sexual dysfunction could be a differentiating characteristic in the psychiatric outpatient clinic. Methods: One hundred seventy-six male psychiatric outpatients participated in the study and completed self-reported measures assessing symptoms of aging, depression, and anxiety. Symptoms of aging were assessed by the Aging Males’ Symptoms scale. Anxiety and depression were measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Erectile dysfunction was considered if a response to item 15 on the Aging Males’ Symptoms scale (impaired sexual potency) was rated with 4 or 5 points. <b>Affective</b> <b>disturbance</b> was assessed by the total scores of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: Age was correlated with less anxiety and more sexual symptoms.

After a gradual discontinuation of treatment with topiramate, a complete remission of the cognitive and affective symptoms was observed within 6 weeks. Functional neuroimaging studies by means of SPECT were conducted 2 weeks and 8 months following TPM discontinuation. This case report {{seems to suggest that}} functional disruption of the cerebello-cerebral circuitry, leading to CCAS, can follow treatment with topiramate.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the theory and}} practice behind the psychological assessment of sexually abused children using the posttraumatic stress disorder subcategories for abused children. Measurement of cognitive disturbances including intrusive recollections of the trauma, <b>affective</b> <b>disturbances</b> by simultaneously experienced high arousal and high avoidance symptoms, and observable behavioral changes are described, and practical approaches including case examples are presented. Included {{in this article is}} a discussion about the different standards of legal proof that psychologists must meet in the various kinds of child sexual abuse cases that they might be called upon to consult. Psychologists need to know basic child development and have the assessment skills to measure it as well as specialized training in the field of child abuse to avoid the perils of becoming overinvolved in these emotional cases...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{is limited}} {{information}} on the presentation and characteristics of psychotic illness experienced by people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Aims: To describe autistic and psychotic phenomenology {{in a group of}} individuals with comorbid ASD and psychosis (ASD–P) and compare this group with populations affected by either, alone. Method: We studied 116 individuals with ASD–P. We compared features of their ASD with people with ASD and no comorbid psychosis (ASD–NP), and clinical characteristics of psychosis in ASD–P with people with psychosis only. Results: Individuals with ASD–P had more diagnoses of atypical psychosis and fewer of schizophrenia compared with individuals with psychosis only. People with ASD–P had fewer stereotyped interests/behaviours compared with those with ASD–NP. Conclusions: Our data show there may be a specific subtype of ASD linked to comorbid psychosis. The results support findings that psychosis in people with ASD is often atypical, particularly regarding <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance...</b>|$|R
40|$|Patients with Huntington's Disease (HD) {{were tested}} on 2 tasks, {{probabilistic}} classification learning and artificial grammar learning. Both tasks are performed normally by amnesic patients and {{are considered to}} be independent of declarative memory. Patients with HD were severely impaired in probabilistic learning but performed normally in artificial grammar learning. The probabilistic classification task may be akin to habit-learning tasks that depend on the neostriatum, whereas artificial grammar learning may depend on changes within neocortex similar to what is thought to occur in perceptual priming. The deficit in the probabilistic classification task indicates that impaired nondeclarative learning in patients with HD occurs not only in motor tasks but also in nondeclarative learning tasks that have no motor component. Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited progressive neurological disorder that is characterized by involuntary, choreiform movements, <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance,</b> and progressive cognitive and functional decline. The primary neuropathology is loss of cells in the caudate nucleus and the putamen (Vonsattel et al., 1985), although there is eventually mor...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{mechanisms}} of information processing by corticostriatal circuits are currently {{a matter of}} intense debate amongst cognitive scientists. Huntington's disease, an autosomal-dominant neurogenetic disorder characterized clinically by a triad of motor, cognitive, and <b>affective</b> <b>disturbance,</b> is associated with neuronal loss within corticostriatal circuits, and as such provides a valuable model for understanding the role of these circuits in normal behaviour, and their disruption in disease. We review findings from our studies of the breakdown of cognition in Huntington's disease, with a particular emphasis on executive functions and visual recognition memory. We show that Huntington's disease patients exhibit a neuropsychological profile that shows a discernible pattern of progression with advancing disease, and appears to result from a breakdown in the {{mechanisms of}} response selection. These {{findings are consistent with}} recent computational models that suggest that corticostriatal circuits compute the patterns of sensory input and response output which are of behavioural significance within a particular environmental context...|$|R
