5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> has {{undergone}} academic scrutiny {{is the nature}} of section8B(2) as an ouster clause. An ouster clause is an objectively worded provision which is drafted to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{concerns}} {{women is}} {{the dress code}} expected of them. Islam requires {{both men and women}} to dress modestly; this concept is known as hijab and covers a wide interpretation of behavior and garments. There is mixed opinion among feminists over extremes of externally imposed control. Women from other religions are also expected to follow dress codes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{strained}} the UN logistics {{system was}} the lack of a previously drafted resupply plan. Consumption rates differed among the various units {{and as a result of}} a lack of coordination, some UN units faced supply shortages when other units would request more material than they actually needed. In order to rectify this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a plan as the need arose.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> is <b>that</b> the {{approach}} provides neither a direct {{test of the}} power law itself nor the underlying assumptions of the magnitude estimation/production method.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> was <b>that</b> the Act {{required}} the {{keeping of records}} to verify compliance; the appellee argued that this violated his Fifth Amendment right protecting him from self-incrimination.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> is <b>that</b> the {{material}} conditional is {{not designed to}} deal with counterfactuals and other cases that people often find in if-then reasoning. This has inspired people to develop modal logic.|$|R
5|$|Of {{concern to}} breeders is the {{condition}} known as uterine inertia, {{an inability to}} expel the foetus due to weak muscles. This condition was present {{in one of the}} foundation cats and appears in some Singapura females today. Individuals with uterine inertia may require deliveries to be made by Caesarean section. <b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> affects the breed is Pyruvate kinase deficiency, which leads to hemolytic anemia. Typical symptoms includes lethargy, diarrhea, lack of appetite, poor coat quality, weight loss and jaundice.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, <b>another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{will have to be}} considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{received}} attention during Clark's candidacy was {{allegations of sexual}} exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeepers. This gross problem was brought to light after Anders Kompass exposed the sexual assault of children by peacekeepers in the Central African Republic. During the United Nations Secretary General Candidate informal dialogues, Clark said that the UN needed to deal quickly with sexual exploitation and abuse, and gender-based violence by peacekeepers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> is <b>that</b> in {{infinite}} dimensional Hilbert spaces, {{an infinite}} number of measurement outcomes would be required. Making assumptions about the structure and using a finite measurement basis leads to artifacts in the phase space density.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> is <b>that</b> the {{technological}} innovations and possibility for new research outpace {{the creation of}} clear and adapted ethical guidelines. Nonetheless, some guidelines do exist and are regularly updated by the Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR).|$|R
30|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> is <b>that</b> {{it might}} be {{impossible}} to compute Business Value for few requirements. Possible solutions include: (1) relating such requirements to those that create maximum Business Values (2) considering the time dependency criteria between such requirements.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> arises with non-finitely {{generated}} modules is {{that there}} are torsion-free modules which are not free. For instance, consider the ring Z of integers. Then Q is a torsion-free Z-module which is not free. Another classical example of such a module is the Baer–Specker group, the group of all sequences of integers under termwise addition. In general, the question of which infinitely generated torsion-free abelian groups are free depends on which large cardinals exist. A consequence is that any structure theorem for infinitely generated modules depends on a choice of set theory axioms and may be invalid under a different choice.|$|E
25|$|Internet {{security}} experts {{said that the}} passwords were easy to unscramble because of LinkedIn's failure to use a salt when hashing them, which is considered an insecure practice because it allows attackers to quickly reverse the scrambling process using existing standard rainbow tables, pre-made lists of matching scrambled and unscrambled passwords. <b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> sparked controversy was the iOS app provided by LinkedIn, which grabs personal names, emails, and notes from a mobile calendar without the user's approval. Security experts working for Skycure Security said that the application collects a user's personal data and sends it to the LinkedIn server. LinkedIn claimed the permission for this feature is user-granted, and the information is sent securely using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. The company added that it had never stored or shared that information with a third party.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that EMF or DBF measurements are just qualitative measurements, as an ion does not necessarily cross the channel through the center of its lumen in a straight line and it is often accompanied by other ions moving in the same or opposite directions, which dramatically changes the dynamics of the system. Moreover, unlike steered MD calculations where the protein residues dynamically reposition themselves as an ion or ions are bouncing across the channel, in our EMF or DBF calculations protein is modeled as a static continuum, which further affects the energy calculations in a more quantitative way. <b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> additionally impacts the measurements is absence of water hydration molecules, which move with the ion and shield part of its charge. Having said all of above, still computing EMF or DBF is valuable to address channel selectivity or gating. Computing either of these two energy barriers is available as an option in BioMOCA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> is <b>that</b> {{the corpus}} {{is in effect}} a library, {{containing}} one of each book. A single, prolific author is thereby able to noticeably insert new phrases into the Google Books lexicon, whether the author is widely read or not.|$|R
30|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> is <b>that</b> the BK {{model is}} not {{standard}} and incorporates several debatable assumptions. It is also {{difficult to see}} the role of each assumption on the results. A more detailed discussion of these issues would become quite technical for this survey.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> is <b>that</b> the {{transfer}} function of a seismograph must be accurately characterized, so that its frequency response is known. This is often the crucial difference between professional and amateur instruments. Most instruments are characterized on a variable frequency shaking table.|$|R
25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, linear chromosomes face <b>another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> is {{not seen}} in circular DNA replication. Due {{to the fact that}} an RNA primer is required for initiation of DNA synthesis, the lagging strand is at a disadvantage in replicating the entire chromosome. While the leading strand can use a single RNA primer to extend the 5' terminus of the replicating DNA strand, multiple RNA primers are responsible for lagging strand synthesis, creating Okazaki fragments. This leads to an issue {{due to the fact that}} DNA polymerase is only able to add to the 3' end of the DNA strand. The 3'-5' action of DNA polymerase along the parent strand leaves a short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) region at the 3' end of the parent strand when the Okazaki fragments have been repaired. Since replication occurs in opposite directions at opposite ends of parent chromosomes, each strand is a lagging strand at one end. Over time this would result in progressive shortening of both daughter chromosomes. This is known as the end replication problem.|$|E
25|$|Reintroduction of extirpated native species, such as {{the swift}} fox, is <b>another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> must be {{balanced}} with the needs and tolerances of existing species. Other extirpated species that formerly occupied the grasslands were the bison (Bison bison), wolf (Canis lupus) and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), {{which may not be}} feasible to reintroduce due to cost and potential conflict with humans. Educational and scientific pursuits require guidelines and permits to protect the landscape from inadvertent damage such as collection of rare species or archaeological samples. Extraction of natural resources such as minerals, gas, oil, and coal are incompatible with the management intent of the protected area, as are linear developments such as roads, pipelines and power lines. As such, only freehold areas may be explored for resource extraction, and no new linear developments are planned; however, construction of a viewing area is being considered to limit and concentrate public access to an approved and controlled area. Fencing and signage, used for public safety and resource protection, are also kept to a minimum.|$|E
25|$|The first Filipinos {{immigrants}} {{that came}} to the United States were treated {{the same way as}} any other group of immigrants. When the first group of Filipinos joined the theater community they also received a lot of backlash. One of the most common instances are racial issues. One of the most popular plays that had a lot of filipino actors, Miss Saigon, had the issue of casting a white actor for an Asian role (113). With this, it exposed the history of yellow face within the theater community. <b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> was faced due to Miss Saigon was when it had its own production in the Philippines. J.V Ejercito, the owner of the production of Miss Saigon, {{became a member of the}} Philippine congress. J.V Ejercito’s background stirred up controversies since his father Joseph Estrada was still in power when the production was going on. The public implied that the production gained it money not through profit but through politics and free enterprise. During the production of Miss Saigon, the international work force for Filipinos was also rising. Filipinos were seen as Little Brown Fucking Machines (LBFM) my military men thus giving Filipinos the roles of prostitutes within plays. Because of Miss Saigon, Filipinos were then seen as maids and domestic helpers.|$|E
50|$|Near {{the end of}} the Thirty Years' War, the compromising spirit seen in Philip Melanchthon rose {{up again}} in Helmstedt School and {{especially}} in theology of Georgius Calixtus, causing the syncretistic controversy. <b>Another</b> theological <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> arose was the Crypto-Kenotic controversy.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> was <b>that</b> European mines were {{exhausted}} of silver ore and gold. What ore remained was too deep to recover, as water would fill the mine, and technology was not sufficiently advanced enough to successfully remove {{the water to}} get to the ore or gold.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the criticisms}} around the {{classification}} system is the complexity of categorizing people with intellectual disabilities. [...] <b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> is <b>that</b> {{people who are at}} the higher functional end of having an intellectual disability have a performance advantage over those with more severe intellectual disabilities.|$|R
25|$|During the 1980s, {{relations}} between Turkey and the United States gradually recovered {{the closeness of}} earlier years. In March 1980 Turkey and the United States signed the Defense and Economic Cooperation Agreement (DECA), in which the United States was granted access to 26 military facilities, in return for which Turkey could buy modern military hardware and was given $450 million to start shopping. Although Ankara resented continued attempts by the United States Congress to restrict military assistance to Turkey because of Cyprus and to introduce congressional resolutions condemning the Armenian Genocide, the Özal government generally perceived the administration of President George H.W. Bush as sympathetic to Turkish interests. It was in this period that the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) was established and started to build F-16 Fighting Falcon jets under licence in Turkey. Washington also demonstrated its support of Özal's market-oriented economic policies and efforts to open the Turkish economy to international trade by pushing for acceptance of an International Monetary Fund program to provide economic assistance to Turkey. Furthermore, the United States, unlike European countries, did not persistently and publicly criticize Turkey over allegations of human rights violations. Also, the United States did not pressure Özal on the Kurdish problem, <b>another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> seemed to preoccupy the Europeans. By 1989 the United States had recovered a generally positive image among the Turkish political elite.|$|E
500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> caused Garfield {{trouble in}} his 1874 {{re-election}} bid was the so-called [...] "Salary Grab" [...] of 1873, which increased the compensation {{for members of}} Congress by 50 percent, retroactive to 1871. Garfield was responsible, as Appropriations Committee chairman, for shepherding the legislative appropriations bill through the House; during the debate in February 1873, Massachusetts Representative Benjamin Butler offered the increase as an amendment, and despite Garfield's opposition, it passed the House and eventually became law. The law was very popular in the House, as almost half the members were lame ducks, but the public was outraged, and many of Garfield's constituents blamed him, though he {{refused to accept the}} increase. [...] In what was a bad year for Republicans, who lost control of the House {{for the first time since}} the Civil War, Garfield had his closest congressional election, winning with only 57 percent of the vote.|$|E
500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{has been}} {{difficult}} to understand is how they took off. Earlier suggestions were that pterosaurs were largely cold-blooded gliding animals, deriving warmth from the environment like modern lizards, rather than burning calories. In this case, it was unclear how the larger ones of enormous size, with an inefficient cold-blooded metabolism, could manage a bird-like takeoff strategy, using only the hind limbs to generate thrust for getting airborne. Later research shows them instead as being warm-blooded and having powerful flight muscles, and using the flight muscles for walking as quadrupeds. Mark Witton of the University of Portsmouth and Mike Habib of Johns Hopkins University suggested that pterosaurs used a vaulting mechanism to obtain flight. The tremendous power of their winged forelimbs would enable them to take off with ease. Once aloft, pterosaurs could reach speeds of up to [...] and travel thousands of kilometres.|$|E
30|$|<b>Another</b> puzzling <b>issue</b> is <b>that</b> a {{valuable}} percentage of patients, almost elderly, show {{more than one}} cause of dyspnea[5, 6].|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> is <b>that</b> the Toys [...] "R" [...] Us sign {{is exempt}} from but way beyond the bylaws. The BowMac sign itself is 215% too tall and 1823% larger than the allowed area; the Toys [...] "R" [...] Us {{billboard}} covers roughly three quarters of this space.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> is <b>that</b> the Peeters {{directive}} {{stipulates that}} the language of administration and local public services should at all times be Dutch, the only official language of the concerned municipalities. It is obligatory to speak Dutch in meetings of the municipal council and the Board of Mayor and Aldermen.|$|R
500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{needed to}} be dealt with was the {{possibility}} that the economy would revive. This was initially denied by Mandel (who was quickly forced to revise his opinion, and later devoted his PhD dissertation to late capitalism, analysing the unexpected [...] "third age" [...] of capitalist development). Mandel's perspective mirrored uncertainty at that time about the future viability and prospects of capitalism, not just among all Trotskyist groups, but also among leading economists. Paul Samuelson had envisaged in 1943 the probability of a [...] "nightmarish combination of the worst features of inflation and deflation", worrying that [...] "there would be ushered in the greatest period of unemployment and industrial dislocation which any economy has ever faced". Joseph Schumpeter for his part claimed that [...] "he general opinion seems to be that capitalist methods will be unequal to the task of reconstruction". He regarded it as [...] "not open to doubt that the decay of capitalist society is very far advanced".|$|E
500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> marked Johnston's {{career was}} the Funder vs. Readjuster debate. Funders {{maintained}} that the state was obligated to pay back its entire pre-War debt, whereas the Readjusters suggested differing, lesser figures, regarding how much was owed. The controversy culminated {{in the end of}} the Conservative Party in Virginia and the formation of the Readjuster Party and the Democratic Party. William Mahone was chosen as head of the Readjusters and they gained control of the state legislature in 1879, but not the governorship. The legislature then elected Mahone as the successor to Democrat Robert E. Withers in the U. S. Senate. However, without a sympathetic governor, they could not enact their reforms. Their next chance came in the election of 1881; their aim was to elect a governor, but most importantly to maintain control of the state legislature, since it would elect [...] "a successor to the Hon. John W. Johnston..." [...] Their party succeeded and the legislature elected prominent Readjuster, and Mahone's [...] "intimate friend", Harrison H. Riddleberger to replace Johnston, eighty-one to forty-nine.|$|E
500|$|On the ban {{of using}} the [...] "Allah" [...] issue during campaigns, the DAP had gone against it and had gone ahead with the issue in its campaign. Wong Ho Leng, the DAP {{election}} candidate, said that the facts must be made known to the public. Wong also promised that if elected, he would call upon the Prime Minister and Home Minister to immediately cease the legal dispute with the Christian churches over these matters to protect the freedom of religion in Malaysia for non-Muslims. The DAP has also challenge candidate Robert Lau to make his stand about the ban on non-Muslims using the word “Allah” with DAP MP Teresa Kok stating that [...] "If Robert Lau intends to be a Member of Parliament that speaks up for a Christian-majority constituency, Sibu, then he has the moral duty to declare his stand on this thorny issue, so that the voters in Sibu can decide whether they can count on him to speak up on this issue," [...] <b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> was brought up during the by-election was {{the decision of the}} Home Ministry to destroy the 5,000 copies of Indonesian Bibles confiscated.|$|E
50|$|One {{story told}} how the {{children}} of 58 Toronto schools had sold 10,000 Christmas seals. <b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> announced <b>that</b> out in Regina, Saskatchewan another paper, the Regina Leader, had written to say its staff would sell the seals and send the money back for the sanatorium being built in Muskoka.|$|R
3000|$|... (..)= 0 {{corresponding}} to zero state. <b>Another</b> technical <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> might cause numerical instability is the low rank {{of the matrix}} A, when a particular element becomes large enough (e.g., for positive eigenvalues). This may be avoided by setting the corresponding α= 0 and reformulating A.|$|R
3000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>issue</b> is <b>that</b> {{only those}} major {{components}} in Equation (68) are useful while some components {{are not only}} useless but also disturbing, especially when we consider a limited size of samples. To do so, one may consider that the columns of the matrix U consist of the eigenvectors of Σ [...]...|$|R
