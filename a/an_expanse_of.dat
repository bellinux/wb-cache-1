5|$|On 1 July, Rupert outmanoeuvred the Covenanters and Parliamentarians {{to relieve}} the city. The next day, he sought battle with them {{even though he was}} outnumbered. He was dissuaded from attacking {{immediately}} and during the day both sides gathered their full strength on Marston Moor, <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> wild meadow west of York. Towards evening, the Covenanters and Parliamentarians themselves launched a surprise attack. After a confused fight lasting two hours, Parliamentarian cavalry under Oliver Cromwell routed the Royalist cavalry from the field and, with Leven's infantry, annihilated the remaining Royalist infantry.|$|E
5|$|As English cathedrals {{are often}} {{surrounded}} by <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> green lawn, {{the plan is}} usually clearly visible at ground level, {{which is not the}} case with the many European cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings. The general impression is that the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly balanced by the strong verticals of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an impression of tremendous length and have been described as resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E
5|$|During Darwin's lifetime, many {{geographical}} {{features were}} given his name. <b>An</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> water adjoining the Beagle Channel was named Darwin Sound by Robert FitzRoy after Darwin's prompt action, {{along with two}} or three of the men, saved them from being marooned on a nearby shore when a collapsing glacier caused a large wave that would have swept away their boats, and the nearby Mount Darwin in the Andes was named in celebration of Darwin's 25th birthday. When the Beagle was surveying Australia in 1839, Darwin's friend John Lort Stokes sighted a natural harbour which the ship's captain Wickham named Port Darwin: a nearby settlement was renamed Darwin in 1911, and it became the capital city of Australia's Northern Territory.|$|E

5|$|The Mumbai Suburban Railway, popularly {{referred}} to as Locals forms {{the backbone of the}} city's transport system. It is operated by the Central Railway and Western Railway zones of the Indian Railways. Mumbai's suburban rail systems carried a total of 6.3million passengers every day in 2007. Trains are overcrowded during peak hours, with nine-car trains of rated capacity 1,700 passengers, actually carrying around 4,500 passengers at peak hours. The Mumbai rail network is spread at <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> 319 route kilometres. 191 rakes (train-sets) of 9 car and 12 car composition are utilised to run a total of 2,226 train services in the city.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Cristobal {{originated}} from a westward-tracking tropical wave which {{emerged from the}} western coast of Africa on August 14, accompanied for several days by <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> clouds. Some cyclonic turning was evident as the disturbance approached the Leeward Islands by August 21, but a Hurricane Hunters flight tasked with investigating the system did not reveal a strong circulation at the surface. The system failed to consolidate as it traversed Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, but on August 23, further reconnaissance data confirmed {{the formation of a}} tropical depression just south of the Caicos Islands. The nascent cyclone slowly moved north-northwestward toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Moderate wind shear in the area kept convection over the depression disorganized and outflow limited, and the storm only gradually intensified. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Cristobal at 06:00UTC on August24, while located just north of Mayaguana in the Bahamas, but its structure was vertically tilted and suboptimally broad.|$|E

25|$|The {{upper reaches}} of the river once abounded in flightless moa, predated upon by the Haast's eagle. The river was known by the Māori as Mata-au, meaning current or eddy in <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> water. This name, now more {{frequently}} rendered as Matau, is still used for one of the two main channels of the Clutha delta. In the early days of European exploration there was at least one settlement of some 250-300 Māori close to the river's banks. The river takes its European name from Cluaidh, the Scots Gaelic name for the River Clyde in Scotland which runs through Glasgow. During New Zealand's early colonial history it was known as the Molyneux, that name given to it by Captain Cook. During early European settlement, a whaling station was established close to the river's mouth, and during this period the sea was the source of almost all of the area's economy.|$|E
25|$|The {{valley floor}} is <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> plains crossed {{by a number}} of small rivers, streams and arroyos, with the most {{significant}} being the Atoyac River. The Atoyac River has its beginning in the runoff of both the Iztaccíhuatl and Popocatepetl volcanoes. The area has an average altitude of 2,190masl, with a gentle descent from northwest to southeast along the Atoyac River. There are two main elevations: the Zapotecas Mountain, which rises about 200 meters over the valley and the Tecajetes, which rises 210 meters. There is mountain biking and motocross on the Zapotecas Mountain as well as parasailing at the San Bernardino Chalchilhuapan Mountain. Each year, there is a mountain biking event just north of the city in March in three categories: beginners, advanced and expert. The race begins from the main plaza of Cholula and extends for 50km through a number of small communities. The Zapotecas Mountain is important culturally as well, figuring in a number of local myths and legends, including one about a man who made a pact with a demon in order to obtain money to sponsor a religious festival.|$|E

500|$|Popular {{landscaping}} authors, including Gertrude Jekyll and Russell Page, have praised P.atriplicifolia for {{its usefulness}} in gardens and landscaping features. It is most commonly planted as an accent feature, {{such as an}} [...] "island" [...] in <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> lawn, {{but it can also}} be used as filler within a larger landscaping feature, or to enhance areas where the existing natural appearance is retained. Gardening author Troy Marden describes P.atriplicifolia as having a [...] "see-through" [...] quality that is ideal for borders. Some experts suggest groups of three plants provide the best landscape appearance. It is also suitable for container gardening.|$|E
500|$|Laurence bought Stokesay from Theobald and Philip in 1281, {{possibly}} {{for around}} £266, {{which he could}} easily have afforded, as {{he had made a}} fortune from the wool trade. Laurence exported wool from the Welsh Marches, travelling across Europe to negotiate sales, and maintaining offices in Shrewsbury and London. He had become the most important wool merchant in England, helping to set government trade policies and lending money to the major nobility. Stokesay Castle would form a secure personal home for Laurence, well-positioned close to his other business operations in the region. It was also intended {{to be used as a}} commercial estate, as it was worth around £26 a year, with [...] of agricultural land, [...] of meadows, <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> woodland, along with watermills and a dovecot.|$|E
500|$|During the Devensian glaciation, {{the northernmost}} {{part of the}} {{peninsula}} from which Britain was formed was covered with glacial ice, and the sea level was about [...] lower than it is today. This glacial ice advanced and retreated several times during this period, and {{much of what is}} now the North Sea and the English Channel was <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> low-lying tundra, which, around 12,000BC, extended northwards to a point roughly parallel with Aberdeenshire, in eastern Scotland. In 1998, archaeologist B.J. Coles named this low-lying area [...] "Doggerland", in which the River Thames flowed somewhat to the north of its current route, joining the Rhine to flow west to the Atlantic Ocean along the line of what is now the English Channel. Human hunters roamed this land, which, by about 8000BC, had a varied coastline of lagoons, salt marshes, mudflats, beaches, inland streams, rivers, marshes, and included lakes. It may have been the richest hunting, fowling and fishing ground available to the people of Mesolithic Europe.|$|E
