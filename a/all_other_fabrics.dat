40|$|Flat {{knitting}} is {{a widely}} used fabric manufacturing technology. Compared with warp knitting and circular knitting, flat knitting is characterized by its higher process flexibility and greater fabric structure variety. In this work, flat knitting technology was exploited to fabricate auxetic fabrics which laterally expand when stretched. Three kinds of geometrical structures, i. e. foldable structure, rotating rectangle and reentrant hexagon, were employed as basic reference structures {{for the development of}} these kinds of auxetic fabrics. The weft knitting processes based on these structures were specially developed and auxetic fabrics were fabricated using the computerized flat knitting machines. The Poisson's ratio-strain curves of the developed fabrics were plotted and compared with those calculated using existing models to demonstrate the variation trends of Poisson's ratio with the axial strain. The results reveal that except the folded fabric formed with the face loops and reverse loops in a rectangular arrangement, of which the auxetic effect firstly increases and then decreases with the axial strain, the auxetic effects of <b>all</b> <b>other</b> <b>fabrics</b> decrease with an increase of the axial strain. The work also shows that auxetic fabrics can be realized based on knitted structures and that flat knitting technology can provide a simple, but highly effective way of fabricating auxetic fabrics from conventional yarns.

At the upper sensor, Teflon® treated fabrics had the lowest absorbed energy (150.9  ±  30.5  kJ m− 2) and the highest mean time to second-degree burn (6.3  ±  2.9  s) overall, which differed significantly from all other finishes with the upper sensor absorbed energy mean values ranging from 245.2 to 253.3  kJ m− 2 (for water resistant and soil release treatments respectively). As many of the 3 -layer fabric systems did not meet the criteria needed to predict a second-degree burn, a separate analysis of just the 1 - and 2 -layered fabric systems for the middle and lower sensors was carried out. The effect of finish was not significant for the middle sensor results (F 3, 64  =  0.32) but was for the lower sensor (F 3, 64  =  2.79, p ≤  0.05). Although, not included in the ANOVA it is important to note that in the 3 -layer configuration more twill-weave Teflon® treated fabrics did not meet the second-degree burn criteria compared with the other fabric combinations. None of the Teflon® treated fabrics met the third-degree burn criteria even as a single layer (see Table  2). Whereas, <b>all</b> <b>other</b> <b>fabrics</b> as a single or double layered system reached a third degree burn for at least one specimen.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine whether various selected finishing treatments which may be applied to plain and twill weave fabrics used for chefs’ jackets can offer the potential for protection against scald injuries, as well as examining the impact of layering fabrics. Results showed that the Teflon® finished fabrics which offer combined water and stain repellency had the longest time to predicted skin burn injury and lowest absorbed energy compared with <b>all</b> <b>other</b> <b>fabric</b> finishes. Increasing the numbers of layers of the Teflon® finished fabrics has the greatest potential for providing good protection against scald injuries as much of the water in a hot-water splash runs off the repellent fabric surface. None of the Teflon® treated fabric systems reached the predicted third-degree burn criterion, even as a single layered system, whereas, <b>all</b> <b>other</b> fabric/finishes met the third-degree burn criterion as a single and sometimes double-layered system. Conflicting results were evident for the soil-release finish, which lowered the protective performance in twill weave fabrics, but increased protection in the plain weave fabrics (compared to regular finished fabrics). With the exception of soil-release finishes, the heavier weight twill weave fabric offered longer times to predicted second-degree burn and lower absorbed energy, than the lighter weight plain weave fabrics. Furthermore, the addition of another layer to the fabric system tended to increase the potential protective performance of the fabric systems for most fabric finishes, although decreasing the air permeability. There is clear evidence in this research of the benefit of applying a Teflon® finish to chef’s clothing, not only to improve repellency against oil and water-borne stains, but also as a means to improve protection against hot water splash. The Teflon® finish maintains a level of thermal comfort which is currently accepted in chef’s clothing. Further work to determine whether Teflon® would also increase protection against hot oils and steam is recommended, as well as the durability of the treatment to repeated laundering.|$|R
