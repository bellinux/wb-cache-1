25|$|Djoser is {{best known}} for his {{innovative}} tomb, which dominates the Saqqara landscape. In this tomb he is referred to by his Horus name Netjeriykhet; Djoser is a name given by New Kingdom visitors thousands of years later. Djoser’s step pyramid is astounding in its departure from previous architecture. It sets several important precedents, perhaps the most important of which is its status as the first monumental structure made of stone. The social implications of such a large and carefully sculpted stone structure <b>are</b> <b>staggering.</b> The process of building such a structure would be far more labor-intensive than previous monuments of mud-brick. This suggests that the state, and therefore the royal government had a new level of control of resources, both material and human. Also, from this point on, kings of the Old Kingdom are buried in the North, rather than at Abydos. Furthermore, although the plan of Djoser’s pyramid complex is different than later complexes, many elements persist and the step pyramid sets the stage for later pyramids of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Dynasties, including the great pyramids of Giza. Finally, another intriguing first is the identification of the architect Imhotep, who is credited with the design and construction of the complex.|$|E

I found it out this morning while they were dressing me. It's like a hole in this infernal phantom world. Just put your hand by mine. No--not there. Ah! Yes! I see it.

In Los Angeles County, home to 1.4 million people aged 60 or older, EPICenter data show that approximately one third fall each year. In 2010, {{there were more than}} 20,000 hospitalizations for falls among 65+ year olds with an average of $61,800 in medical cost per visit. In California, over 565,000 older people fell more than once in 2007 (Wallace et al., 2010) and the costs of falls in California could reach $6.6 billion in 2020 (Trent, written communication, 2010).

50|$|They defeat {{an advance}} force of Tugars {{by setting up}} an ambush, {{but the bulk of}} the army is not far behind. The 35th and their Rus {{counterparts}} are battling for their lives. Many men sacrifice themselves, particularly the train conductor, Malady, who blows himself up taking hundreds of Tugars with him. The Tugar losses <b>are</b> <b>staggering</b> but they begin to overwhelm the city. The Qar Qarth of the Tugars, Muzta, faces opposition within his horde so he does not listen to the advice of his advisor Qubata to draw out the attack and starve the Yankees into submission. They make a suicidal charge, which begins to work as they break into the city. With little hope left, some of the men abandon the rest on the Ogunquit and sail away.|$|E
50|$|The Neapolitan {{squadron}} {{has been}} entirely wiped {{out during the}} battle and its aftermath. The Spaniards cannot hope {{to break through the}} French blockade anymore. Worried about the fate of their husbands, the women of Naples deputise Paolo Giovio to enquire about the losses. He reports that 700 to 800 men have been killed on the Spanish side ("the flower of the Spanish army") and that about as many have been taken prisoners by the French. Numerous nobles and high-ranking militaries and administrators are either dead or captives, including the commander of the fleet Alfonso d'Avalos. Among the soldiers, the losses <b>are</b> <b>staggering.</b> On the Spanish Capitana, every single one of the 150 soldiers has been killed, on the Gobba 103 out of 108 soldiers have fallen. Paolo Giovio's description of the galleys after the battle is most gruesome.|$|E
50|$|Yellowstone Lake in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, is {{the site}} of the most recent catastrophic species invasion. The Washington Post {{reported}} that the nonindigenous lake trout, a native of the Great Lakes, had been insidiously introduced into one of the nation's premier fisheries. The native Yellowstone cutthroat trout may not compete well with lake trout because lake trout eat cutthroat trout. The potential ecological repercussions <b>are</b> <b>staggering.</b> If populations of cutthroat trout continue to decline, grizzly bears could lose an important posthibernation food because the native cutthroat trout spawn in the streams and are easy prey for the bears, whereas the nonindigenous lake trout spawn in deep water. The National park Service has begun an aggressive attempt to eradicate the invasive fish by hiring commercial fishing crews, and have removed over 1.7 million with gill nets. It is estimated that for every lake trout removed from Yellowstone Lake, 41 cutthroat trout are saved. So far the cutthroat trout have shown modest signs of recovery. However, other threats to the trout remain, such as whirling disease, brought from Europe by nonnative brown trout.|$|E
