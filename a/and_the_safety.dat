5|$|On lap 22 Adrian Sutil crashed at turn four <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> car {{had to be}} deployed; Hamilton had pitted {{just before}} the incident. Thus the pit lane was closed but Alonso and Nico Rosberg were forced to pit {{in order to avoid}} running out of fuel, and were given ten-second stop-and-go penalties. When the pit lane was re-opened {{and the rest of the}} field pitted, Massa and Giancarlo Fisichella left the pit lane while the red light was still on. Both were later disqualified from the race on lap 51.|$|E
5|$|Several of the Comet's {{avionics}} {{systems were}} new to civil aviation. One such feature was irreversible powered flight controls, which increased the pilot's ease of control <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> {{of the aircraft}} by preventing aerodynamic forces from changing the directed positions and placement of the aircraft's control surfaces. Additionally, {{a large number of}} the control surfaces, such as the elevators, were equipped with a complex gearing system as a safeguard against accidentally over-stressing the surfaces or airframe at higher speed ranges.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{revolves}} around a hostage crisis and is largely presented as {{an homage to}} the film Die Hard.

In order to protect Chuck's cover <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> of the other hostages, Sarah Walker and John Casey secretly go into the store to remove Chuck, but the mission quickly falls apart when Chuck refuses to leave his friends and family behind.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAccording to the {{research}} of <b>the</b> subjective <b>and</b> <b>the</b> objective <b>safety</b> in Highway Safety Manual (HSM), their relationship <b>and</b> <b>the</b> road <b>safety</b> were discussed and improved. In this paper, <b>the</b> contents <b>and</b> <b>the</b> calculation methods of <b>the</b> subjective <b>and</b> <b>the</b> objective <b>safety</b> were determined based on <b>the</b> expressway investigation <b>and</b> collected data. <b>The</b> subjective <b>safety</b> index was established by the combination of RRCV, FT 85 <b>and</b> NASA-TLX, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> objective <b>safety</b> index was composed of road linear, pavement, traffic facilities and natural environment. In {{the end of the}} paper, SOR was supposed as a safety evaluation index, which is the ratio of <b>the</b> subjective <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> objective one. The application of <b>the</b> subjective <b>and</b> <b>the</b> objective <b>safety</b> was further discussed according to the SOR characteristics...|$|R

5|$|The {{next night}} on Raw, Triple H {{wrestled}} Heyman's newest client, Curtis Axel. He suffered a storyline concussion and was deemed to have forfeited. Despite being medically cleared to wrestle before the June 3 episode of Raw, Vince and Stephanie McMahon {{did not allow}} Triple H to wrestle Axel, citing concerns for his well-being <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> of his children. In response, Triple H stormed out the arena and vowed {{to return to the}} ring the next week on Raw. On that episode, he lost to Axel when McMahon dubiously disqualified him, ordered Axel to leave the ring, then stole the bell and microphone to prevent the match from being restarted.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{categories}} of kicks in football: scrimmage kicks, which can be executed by the offensive team on any down from behind or on the line of scrimmage, and free kicks. The free kicks are the kickoff, which starts {{the first and third}} quarters and overtime and follows a try attempt or a successful field goal, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> kick, which follows a safety.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{the construction of}} a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it was more common for the villages nearby to have grown {{as a result of the}} presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle. The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confined to Europe. When the 13th-century Safad Castle was founded in Galilee in the Holy Land, the 260villages benefitted from the inhabitants' newfound ability to move freely. When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local landscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord. Settlements could also grow naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of proximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importance– perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration– the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement depopulated.|$|E

5|$|On 14 July 1876, Thunderer {{suffered}} a disastrous boiler explosion which killed 45 people. One of her boilers burst as she proceeded from Portsmouth Harbour to Stokes Bay {{to carry out}} a full-power trial. The explosion killed 15 people instantly, including her commanding officer; around 70 others were injured, of whom 30 later died. This was the Royal Navy's most deadly boiler explosion through the whole century. A model representing the failed boiler was made and is now in the Science Museum. The explosion was caused because a pressure gauge was broken <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> valve had corroded in place. When the steam stop valve to the engines was closed, pressure in the boiler rose and could not be released. The four box boilers were the last in service in the Navy and operated at what would even then would have been considered a relatively low pressure, for more modern boilers, of 30 psi. The boiler was repaired and the ship was completed on 26 May 1877 at a cost of £368,428.|$|E
5|$|The race began {{behind the}} safety car but was stopped after three laps {{because of a}} large amount of {{standing}} water on the circuit. After a 45-minute delay, the race was restarted <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> car pulled into the pit lane after thirteen laps. Pole sitter Sebastian Vettel maintained his lead going into the first corner. A second safety car deployment caused by the collision of Mark Webber and Nico Rosberg on lap nineteen closed up the field but Vettel retained the lead. Alonso maintained second position until a botched pit stop during a third safety-car period caused him to drop to third. At the restart on lap thirty-five, Hamilton ran wide at the first corner, allowing Alonso back into second place. Vettel's engine failed eleven laps later, allowing Alonso to move into the lead, which he maintained to win the race.|$|E
5|$|Graves, {{who fell}} to second in class, went into Rivage's gravel trap with a left-front brake failure, {{causing him to}} retire. Toyota retired their No. 6 entry from the race because of an engine failure caused by an {{electrical}} fault. Smoke bellowed from the rear-end of Nakajima's Toyota upon leaving La Source and he {{went back into the}} pit lane where his mechanics worked on rectifying the problem allowing Oliver Jarvis in the No. 8 Audi to inherit the lead. Webber drove straight at the Bus Stop chicane, spun, and drove into the pit lane. Stefan Mücke, who was affected by turbocharger issues, lost control of the No. 66 Ford after one of his rear tyres was punctured, and narrowly avoided going airborne. The vehicle made heavy contact with the left-hand side barriers at Raidillon, heavily damaging the front-end and removing both of its doors, as well as littering debris onto the circuit. His car stopped in the centre of the track, causing the No. 2 Porsche to swerve to avoid hitting the vehicle, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> car was deployed to allow marshals to repair the heavily damaged tyre barrier. Drivers were instructed to steer onto the right-hand side of the track at Eau Rouge because the stranded car blocked the turn. Mücke was transported to the track's medical centre and later taken to the local hospital for a precautionary check-up because of bruising.|$|E

40|$|ARP 4754 A and ARP 4761 are {{international}} {{standards for the}} avionics domains. ARP 4761 provides a guidance for <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> assessment process, while the ARP 4754 A prescribes close interactions between <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> assessment process <b>and</b> system development process in order to capture safety requirements imposed on the design. According to the ARP 4754 A, <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> requirements should be carefully traced and validated. A phase of <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> assessment process is the FHA (Functional Hazard Analysis) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> high-level <b>safety</b> requirements are derived. ARP 4754 A indicates that <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> requirements obtained from the FHA phase should be allocated <b>and</b> validated, but <b>the</b> standard only indicates “What” should be done, but not “How” to do it. Hence, when developing an avionic system, an ad-hoc method must be provided to allocate <b>and</b> validate <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> requirements. Thesis work is focused on providing a systematic approach to allow safety managers jointly with designers to decompose, allocate <b>and</b> validate <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> requirements. Furthermore, <b>the</b> proposed approach is aligned with the ARP 4754 A and DOORS tool, including how to decompose <b>and</b> validate <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> requirements in <b>the</b> system development process. This way will reduce the necessity to provide an ad-hoc method each avionic systems, <b>and</b> overcome <b>the</b> lacking methodology. Finally, a safety-critical system developed by SAAB is used as case study to validate the proposed approach...|$|R
