25|$|For {{compatibility}} with manual offices, {{two types of}} signaling were supported. In areas with mostly machine switches and a few manual switchboards, Panel Call Indicator (PCI) signaling lit lamps on the B operator's desk at the terminating manual office. The lamps illuminated digits on a display panel corresponding to the number dialed. The manual operator connected the call to the appropriate jack, and then repeated the process for the next incoming call. In areas with mostly manual switches, the Call <b>Annunciator</b> signaling system was used to avoid installing lamp panels at every operator station. The Call <b>Annunciator</b> used speech recorded on strips of photographic film to verbally announce the called number to the answering operator.|$|E
2500|$|All buses {{are also}} all {{equipped}} with a Digital Recorders automated voice <b>annunciator</b> system, which announces the major intersections (or on the Rapid Ride buses, the stops). [...] The system was first introduced in 2001 on the 400 series buses. [...] The 300 series buses were retrofitted with the system in 2004 (alongside the TwinVision LED destination signs), and all deliveries since then has had the system factory-installed.|$|E
2500|$|The wing {{features}} large fowler flaps pivoting {{on three}} scissor hinges per wing, {{with a maximum}} 30-degree deflection. The flaps are electrically powered and are controlled by a switch {{to the right of}} the radio stack. The flap indicator is a three-light system which shows when the flaps are at zero, twenty and thirty degrees. The flaps can be selected in between those settings but require visual confirmation of flap position. The wing is rectangular with a 7:1 aspect ratio, no taper and no washout. Small stall strips are installed a few feet out from the root to aid stall performance. The airfoil is a unique design, which the XL2 shares with its predecessor the Europa. This is a Don Dykins airfoil, designated as a [...] "Dykins 12%", because the wing's maximum thickness is 12% of the chord. The airfoil is a semi-symmetrical, laminar-flow design. The stall warning system is a voice <b>annunciator</b> that says [...] "stall, stall".|$|E

6000|$|That burglar-alarm which Susy {{mentions}} led a gay and careless life, {{and had no}} principles. It {{was generally}} out of order {{at one point or}} another; and there was plenty of opportunity, because all the windows and doors in the house, from the cellar up to the top floor, were connected with it. However, in its seasons of being out of order it could trouble us for only a very little while: we quickly found out that it was fooling us, and that it was buzzing its blood-curdling alarm merely for its own amusement. Then we would shut it off, and send to New York for the electrician--there not being one in all Hartford in those days. When the repairs were finished we would set the alarm again and reestablish our confidence in it. It never did any real business except upon one single occasion. All the rest of its expensive career was frivolous and without purpose. Just that one time it performed its duty, and its whole duty--gravely, seriously, admirably. It let fly about two o'clock one black and dreary March morning, and I turned out promptly, because I knew that it was not fooling, this time. The bath-room door was on my side of the bed. I stepped in there, turned up the gas, looked at the <b>annunciator,</b> and turned off the alarm--so far as the door indicated was concerned--thus stopping the racket. Then I came back to bed. Mrs. Clemens opened the debate: ...|$|E

One winter's night we were flung out of bed by the sudden music of that awful gong, and when we hobbled to the <b>annunciator,</b> turned up the gas, and saw the word 'Nursery' exposed, Mrs. McWilliams fainted dead away, and I came {{precious}} near {{doing the same thing}} myself. I seized my shotgun, and stood timing the coachman whilst that appalling buzzing went on. I knew that his gong had flung him out, too, and that he would be along with his gun as soon as he could jump into his clothes. When I judged that the time was ripe, I crept to the room next the nursery, glanced through the window, and saw the dim outline of the coachman in the yard below, standing at present-arms and waiting for a chance. Then I hopped into the nursery and fired, and in the same instant the coachman fired at the red flash of my gun. Both of us were successful; I crippled a nurse, and he shot off all my back hair. We turned up the gas, and telephoned for a surgeon. There was not a sign of a burglar, and no window had been raised. One glass was absent, but that was where the coachman's charge had come through. Here was a fine mystery--a burglar alarm 'going off' at midnight of its own accord, and not a burglar in the neighborhood! ...|$|E
