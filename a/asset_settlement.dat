50|$|By 1998, Kuo {{became the}} {{executive}} director of the party's Policy Research and Coordinating Committee. After he had stepped down, Kuo and Lin Cho-shui proposed that the DPP amend its charter to recognize the Republic of China as Taiwan. The initiative failed, and no revisions were made. Shortly after Chen Shui-bian's election to the presidency in 2000, Kuo pushed for cross-party alliances and a coalition government to be formed. However, in 2001, Kuo stated that he was opposed to proposals that the Democratic Progressive Party form a coalition government, instead favoring a scenario in which the DPP disbanded and rewrote its party charter to attract a wider base before reregistering as a political party. Kuo was first elected to the Legislative Yuan later that year as a member of the DPP, due to the efforts the party had made to ensure a competitive vote distribution in northern Taiwan by asking supporters to vote for candidates based on the last number in voters' identification cards. In his first term Kuo backed a proposal to ban active politicians from owning media outlets and hosting programs. Kuo was tapped to defend the cross-strait relations referendum in March 2004, and faced Jaw Shaw-kong. In his successful December reelection bid, Kuo received NT$26.35 million in political donations, the third highest total of that electoral cycle. In 2006, Kuo skipped a party debate on China policy in protest, as the Chen administration had announced changes without reaching out to the Legislative Yuan. Kuo switched districts for the 2008 legislative elections, choosing to run in Taipei 3 against John Chiang, and lost. When Taiwan signed the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement with China in 2010, Kuo was named the spokesman of a DPP-convened committee against the agreement. Kuo participated in a primary for Taipei 2 in 2011, but was not selected as DPP candidate for the constituency. He was invited to speak at a political forum held in Hong Kong in August 2016, but authorities there denied him a visa.

50|$|As {{part of the}} {{restructuring}} process, Argentina drafted agreements in which repayments would be handled through a New York corporation and governed by United States law. The holdout bondholders found themselves unable to seize Argentine sovereign <b>assets</b> in <b>settlement,</b> but realized that Argentina had omitted to provide for holdout situations and had instead deemed all bonds repayable on pari passu (equal) terms that prevented preferential treatment among bondholders. The holdout bondholders therefore sought, and won, an injunction in 2012 that prohibited Argentina from repaying the 93% of bonds that had been renegotiated, unless they simultaneously paid the 7% holdouts their full amount due as well. Together with the agreement's rights upon future offers ("RUFO") clause, this created a deadlock in which the 93% of renegotiated bondholders could not be paid without paying the 7% holdouts, but any payment to the holdouts would potentially (according to Argentina) trigger the 93% being due repayment at full value too; a sum of around $100 billion that Argentina could not afford. The courts ruled that as Argentina had itself drafted the agreement, and chosen the terms it wished to propose, it could not now claim the terms were unreasonable or unfair, and that this could not be worked around by asserting sovereign status since the injunction did not affect sovereign assets, but simply ruled that Argentina must not give preferential treatment of any group of bondholders over any other group when making repayments.|$|R

The paper then examines the value that the life <b>settlement</b> <b>asset</b> provides to both parties and establishes how that value is assessed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} the economics behind the evolution of payments where by payments I mean the ‘transfer of monetary value’ (in return for goods, services, or real or financial assets). It is clear from this definition of payments that, in order for there to be payments, there first needs to be money. So, the paper first discusses why money might evolve as a result of some frictions inherent in real-world economies. It then discusses the evolution of banks, arguing that banks developed in order to provide payment services (making ‘money’ work more efficiently). The paper then discusses how banks can save on the use of collateral to make payments – collateral that they can convert into loans to earn a return – by the development of ‘payment systems’. Such systems will involve some form of netting of payments (clearing) and final <b>settlement</b> in some <b>asset.</b> ‘Central banks’ fit into this picture by providing, in their liabilities, a <b>settlement</b> <b>asset</b> that the other banks are happy to use.

The prototype was developed on a pilot site in Galle through building up homogeneous data on the land/sea interface from studies conducted on the exposure of the coastal populations, the aim being to enable an evaluation of the hazards combined with the vulnerability and thus an analysis of the risks. Coastal risk scenarios are developed so as to estimate the impacts and consequences of an event (tsunami, storm, etc.) on the assets, the principle behind this being that if, in general, the coastal hazard cannot be decreased, then a better knowledge of it through simulation should make it possible to limit the vulnerability and thus the risk. The Coastal-hazard GIS will also provide a planning tool in terms of locating new settlements, expanding urban areas, siting coastal protection works, etc...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} treaty settlement {{as a mechanism}} for providing social justice and incorporating Maori people into mainstream New Zealand society by improving economic and social well-being. Articles II and III of the Treaty of Waitangi (respectively, collectively held private assets and citizenship benefits and privileges) are described and discussed, along with settlement of claims of breached treaty rights, social policy targeted to Maori, and changes in economic and social well-being from 1976 to 1998. The fundamental proposition is that all Maori are harmed by the legacy of dispossession and marginalization and, therefore, all Maori are entitled to social justice. The central question addresses {{the role of the}} state in providing redress to all indigenous New Zealanders, collectives and individuals, for breaches of both Article II and Article III treaty rights. However, urbanization and detribalization limit access to social justice, and the benefits of treaty settlements have yet to trickle down to individual Maori households. Changes in aggregate indicators of well-being indicate modest improvement in the first decade, and thereafter Maori people experience greater and increasing income inequality, unemployment, and poverty than other population subgroups. To explain these findings, the following questions are addressed: What is the relationship between detribalization and access to treaty <b>settlement</b> <b>assets?</b> What strategies should the government undertake to provide redress (to individual Maori as well as tribal collectives) for breaches of Article III treaty rights...|$|R
