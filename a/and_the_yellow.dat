5|$|Amanita regalis {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from A.muscaria {{by the absence}} of any red color in the cap, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>yellow</b> patches on the stem. If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, Amanita regalis may be confused with the blusher (Amanita rubescens, edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it stains when cut or bruised, and also by the color of the flesh underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is yellowish while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge.|$|E
5|$|Before {{creating}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{had taught}} at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, DePauw University, and the University of Chicago. Inspired by HBO's series The Wire, The Sopranos, and Deadwood, he began working on a short story collection that he later published as Between Here <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Sea in 2006. He published a novel, Galveston, in 2010, and began trying to write for television. His earlier attempts at television writing were unsuccessful {{because of a lack}} of money. Pizzolatto's first major gig in television writing came in 2011, as a screenwriter for AMC's series The Killing. He credits the show with giving him a glimpse of the inner workings of the television industry. Pizzolatto grew increasingly dissatisfied with the series' creative direction, and left two weeks into staff writing sessions for its second season.|$|E
5|$|Before {{developing}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{worked as}} a literature professor for the University of Chicago, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and DePauw University.

His first published work was the short story collection Between Here <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Sea, released in 2006. The author published his debut novel, titled Galveston, four years later, and around the same time began preparing to branch out into the television industry (earlier attempts were never realized due to lack of capital).|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of the game, the 2009 ACC {{championship}} had a large amount of offense. Throughout the contest, neither team punted: Every offensive drive ended in a score or a turnover. Clemson scored first, a touchdown on its opening drive, and held a 7–3 lead {{at the end of the}} first quarter. In the second quarter, Georgia Tech scored 13 points to Clemson's six, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Jackets entered halftime with a 16–13 lead. They extended that lead in the third quarter, scoring 17 points to Clemson's lone touchdown and extra point.

5|$|Jeffrey again visits Dorothy's {{apartment}} {{and she tells}} him that although she knows nothing about him, she has been yearning for him. Jeffrey attends another of Dorothy's performances at the club, where she sings the same song. At the club, Jeffrey spots Frank in the audience fondling a piece of blue velvet fabric he cut from Dorothy's robe. Jeffrey follows Frank and spends {{the next few days}} spying on him. Shortly afterwards, two men that Jeffrey calls the Well-Dressed Man <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Man exit an industrial building that Frank frequently visits. Jeffrey concludes the men are criminal associates of Frank, and tells his new findings to Sandy. The two briefly kiss, though she feels uncomfortable about going any further. Jeffrey immediately visits Dorothy again, and the two have sex. However, when he refuses to hit her, she pressures him, becoming more emotional. In a blind rage he knocks her backwards and is instantly horrified, but Dorothy derives pleasure from it.|$|E
5|$|The birds breed {{easily in}} captivity and can lay eggs every 3 weeks between February and November. Once the female has one egg in her nest, {{she will not}} lay another. An egg takes about 30 days to hatch. The eyes of the young open around 3 weeks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>yellow</b> down will show black pin {{feathers}} at about 6 weeks. The best time for hand raising is at about 10 weeks when their black feathers are in place but the tail feathers are still short. Young birds fledge after about 4 months and both sexes have the colouring of their mother. Mature male birds will become aggressive to young male birds at puberty (4 years); they must be separated if caged.|$|E
50|$|Southern Yellow cattle are one {{of three}} breeds of Chinese <b>Yellow</b> cattle, <b>the</b> other two being <b>the</b> Central Plains <b>Yellow</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Northern <b>Yellow</b> breeds. <b>The</b> Southern <b>Yellow</b> breed is clearly Zebu (Bos taurus indicus), <b>the</b> Northern <b>Yellow</b> breed is clearly taurine (Bos taurus taurus), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Central Plains <b>Yellow</b> breed is intermediate, which means at a glance that <b>the</b> Southern <b>Yellow</b> cattle have high, erect humps, <b>the</b> Northern <b>Yellow</b> cattle have no humps, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Central Plains <b>Yellow</b> cattle have small humps.

5|$|The mantles of the Muisca were {{decorated}} with various colours. The colours {{were obtained from}} seeds; the seed of the avocado for green, flowers; saffron for orange and indigo weed for blue, fruits, crust and roots of plants, from animals as the cochineal insect producing purple colours, and minerals as the blue and green clays of Siachoque, the coloured earth of Suta <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>yellow</b> sediments of Soracá. Also curuba, the flowers of the potato plant (Solanum andigenum) and other colouring materials (Rumex obtusifolia, Bixa orellana, Arrabidaea chica and more) were used. The colours were applied using pencils, applying coloured threads or using stamps. The textiles were produced using various techniques, similar to the Aymara of southern South America and the Mesoamerican cultures. Small textiles functioned as money, just like the tejuelos of gold or salt was used.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Mamie was {{the worst}} {{tropical}} cyclone to affect China in 26years. Originating from an area of disturbed weather near the Philippines in mid-August1985, the system gradually became better organized, and was upgraded into a tropical storm early on August16. It continued to deepen, and late on August17, Mamie attained typhoon intensity. Around this time, Typhoon Mamie reached its peak intensity of , which it maintained for 12hours. After making landfall in Shanghai, the storm steadily weakened. However, after turning north and crossing the Shanghai Peninsula <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Sea, Mamie made a second landfall near Yantai as a tropical storm. After turning northwest and re-entering the Yellow Sea, Mamie moved ashore for {{the third and final}} time near Dairen. On August21, Mamie dissipated inland over northeastern China.|$|E
