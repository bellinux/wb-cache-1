40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine the <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> due to the lack of {{interest}} to sue in the writ of security against an act in a public bidding, when an injunction is not granted and the bidding proceeds. The writ of security against acts in biddings must comply with the action conditions established in the Civil Procedure Code, among which the interest to sue, under penalty of loss of object and <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> according to the Federal Law 12. 016 / 2009. According to the doctrine, rejected the injunction, and once the bidding process is homologated with the agreement signing, there is no interest to sue. However, the current case law of the Supreme Court went on to decide that the nullity of the act contaminates all stages of the proceeding, including the contract, preventing the extinction of the proceedings, that is, there is no loss of object. The Federal Court of the 4 th Region and the Court of Justice of the Rio Grande do Sul State, there is a harmonious application of this understanding. So while persist the current case law, the Administration should enhance the reasons for their actions in order to reduce the risk of legal challenge of their decisions...|$|E
40|$|O presente trabalho tem por propósito demarcar os aspectos essenciais do duplo grau de jurisdição. O instituto é analisado desde sua criação no Brasil até o seu desenvolvimento atual na legislação. O duplo grau será estudado à luz dos princípios constitucionais, bem como a possibilidade de sua supressão causar ou não prejuízo ao direito das partes. Nesse contexto, também são discutidas as vantagens e desvantagens do princípio do duplo grau de jurisdição e sua relação com o efeito devolutivo dos recursos. O reconhecimento de que se trata de princípio constitucional implícito não significa conferir-lhe caráter absoluto, pois compete ao legislador infraconstitucional balizar o seu campo de atuação. A Lei 10. 352 / 2001 imprimiu certa mitigação ao princípio do duplo grau de jurisdição ao inserir o parágrafo terceiro no art. 515 do CPC, permitindo que o {{tribunal}} aprecie o mérito nos casos de extinção do processo (sentença terminativa), desde que a causa esteja madura para o julgamento, isto é, inexista controvérsia ou haja provas suficientes para a solução da lide. Essas mudanças revelam a necessidade de a tutela jurisdicional ser estudada sob a perspectiva de outros elementos, sejam eles relacionados com a razoável duração do processo ou por meio de mecanismos que garantam o acesso à justiça. Portanto, a tutela jurisdicional deve ser exercida de forma mais racionalizada e efetiva para a solução das lidesThe present work aims {{to delimit}} the essential aspects of double degree of jurisdiction, analyzing it since its creation, in Brazil, {{up to the}} current stage of development. Double degree of jurisdiction will be studied in light of constitutional principles. Furthermore, this study will investigate {{whether or not the}} possibility of its extinction causes losses {{to the right of the}} parties and to the lawsuit. In this context, the advantages and disadvantages of the maintenance of the principle of double degree of jurisdiction are discussed, as well as its relation to the devolutive effect of the appeals. The recognition that it is a constitutional principle does not mean granting an absolute character to it, as the infra-constitutional legislator is responsible for saying how it should effectively act. Ordinary legislators must balance some values (rule of law and procedural effectiveness) when choosing options to inform their legislative activity. From this derives the need to give greater effectiveness to the lawsuit, in opposition to the idea of the lawsuit as a mere technical instrument. Law no. 10352 / 2001 relatively mitigated the principle of the double degree of jurisdiction, by allowing, in article 515, paragraph 3, of the Code of Civil Procedure, that the court appreciates the grounds of the action, in cases of <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> (final judgment), provided that it is a question of law and of fact and there is no need to present evidence in the trial. These changes reveal that jurisdiction must be studied in the perspective of other elements, related to the duration of the lawsuit or by means of mechanisms that guarantee access to justice. Therefore, jurisdiction must be exercised in a more rationalized and effective way for the solution of the legal controversies between the parties. It is considered that timely jurisdiction is more effective than tardy jurisdictio...|$|E

Our findings suggest that the social costs of greenhouse gas mitigation through forestation in the U. S. have been significantly overestimated in an influential previous study...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{determine}} if some environmental factors usually present in spawning ponds {{at the time of}} ovulation could potentiate the effects of LHRH or LHRH-A on the plasma level of GtH, oocyte maturation or ovulation in the common carp, Cyprinus carpio. In one experiment females were held {{in the absence of a}} male in cages placed in rearing ponds containing a dense population of unicellular algae; the cages touched the bottom but there was no vegetation inside the cages. When LHRH-A was given in two injections (the first 5 μg/kg, the second, 6 h later, 50 μg/kg) plasma GtH was increased and followed oocyte maturation. Ovulation occurred in 50 % (3 of 6) of the females. In another experiment, using a similar LHRH-A treatment schedule, the females were held in aquaria with added vegetation to serve as a spawning substrate; in such a simplified environment the effect of LHRH-A was not potentiated. Similarly, the natural environment of spawning ponds including the presence of males was of no benefit to the response to low doses of LHRH or LHRH-A when the water temperature was low (12 °C). These results suggest that some undetermined environmental factors besides vegetation present in a pond situation may potentiate the effect of LHRH-A, possibly via <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> an endogenous gonadotropin release-inhibitory factor...|$|R
40|$|Nonpoint-source {{pollution}} {{remains a}} troubling {{source of water}} quality problems despite decades of economics research on the matter. Among the chief difficulties for addressing the issue are the property rights assignments implicit in the current policy environment that favor agricultural nonpoint-source pollution, the unobservability of field-level emissions, and complex fate and transport relationships linking them to ambient water quality. Theoretical and practical considerations lead to the focus on observable abatement actions (conservation practices). Biophysical models are increasingly more capable <b>of</b> linking <b>abatement</b> <b>actions</b> to policy-relevant water quality outcomes. If costs <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>actions</b> are known, finding the least-cost mix <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>actions</b> is possible, while incorporating the nonlinearity of the pollution process. When costs are not known or information is incomplete, regulators can rely on flexible incentive-based programs, but the design of such programs {{is complicated by the}} complexities of emission aggregation. In this work, we focus on the regulator capable of focusing on nonpoint-source emitters. We address the design and performance of three practice-based approaches, ranging from the command-and-control approach mandating practices, to the more flexible performance standard approach where farmers are free to select the optimal mix of on-farm conservation practices, to a fully flexible approach where credits for conservation practices are freely tradable. We do so by utilizing the representation of the nonlinear emission aggregation (fate and transport) process (the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model), and consider cases ranging from the regulator having perfect information on the costs of conservation practices to no information at all. We show how workable programs utilizing the biophysical models and simulation-optimization approaches can be designed, and assess their performance relative to the efficient case. We find that flexible programs perform well both in terms of cost and water quality goals attainment. In particular, a trading program designed around an approximation of the nonlinear pollution process performs well, relative to first-best under no information on the cost of conservation practices...|$|R

The economics <b>of</b> climate <b>action</b> needs {{to be at the}} forefront of climate dialogue to prioritize investments among competing mitigation measures. A marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve is an effective visualization <b>of</b> climate <b>action</b> that initiates a technical and economic discussion of the cost-effectiveness and <b>abatement</b> potential <b>of</b> such <b>actions</b> among local leaders, policy makers, and climate experts. More commonly demonstrated for countries, MAC curves need to be developed for cities because of their heterogeneity, which vary in their urban activities, energy supply, infrastructure stock, and commuting patterns. The methodology for constructing bottom-up MAC curves for cities is presented for technologies that offer fuel switching and/or energy efficiencies, while considering technology lifetimes, city-specific electricity and fuel prices, and emission intensities. Resulting MAC curves are unique to every city, and chart the pathway towards low-carbon growth by prioritizing measures based on cost-effectiveness. A case study of Toronto’s climate targets demonstrates the prioritization of select technologies. Leveraging MAC curves to support climate programs enables cities to strategically invest in financing climate action and designing incentives...|$|R

This study aims to asses the cost effectiveness in <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> embodied emissions. This was done by assessing the embodied emissions of a case building and several conventional design measures along with the implication on production cost. It was found that many of the measures enabled cost effective carbon abatement. Embodied emissions could be reduced by 15 % using cost neutral or nearly cost neutral measures. Abatements up to 18 % were found cost effective in relation to <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> carbon dioxide emissions in other sectors. Abatements up to 24 % were possible with minor increases in total production cost (0. 22 %) even though some of the individual measures were found expensive in relation to <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> carbon dioxide emissions in other sectors.
