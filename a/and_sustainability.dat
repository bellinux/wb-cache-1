40|$|Sustainability {{has become}} an {{important}} issue in container terminal operations. However, relatively {{little research has been}} conducted to assess its association with sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). In this study, SSCM consists of internal <b>sustainability</b> practices <b>and</b> external <b>sustainability</b> collaboration. We empirically examined the effects of internal <b>sustainability</b> practices <b>and</b> external <b>sustainability</b> collaboration on sustainability performance in container terminal operations at the Port of Kaohsiung in Taiwan. We developed a model adopting the SSCM construct, which consisted of two dimensions: internal <b>sustainability</b> practices <b>and</b> external <b>sustainability</b> collaboration. Several research hypotheses were formulated from the theory and the hypotheses were tested using survey data collected from 141 employees who worked with container terminals. We found that internal <b>sustainability</b> practices <b>and</b> external <b>sustainability</b> collaboration positively affected sustainability performance, whereas external sustainability collaboration had a positive influence on internal sustainability practices. There is a discussion of the implications of these findings for developing <b>sustainability</b> <b>and</b> improving <b>sustainability</b> performance in container terminals and ports.

5|$|Energy {{efficient}} <b>and</b> <b>sustainability</b> features designed {{into the}} project led to a LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Elements {{that led to this}} include landscaping that reduces runoff from rainwater, lots of natural light, a more efficient HVAC system that is located under the floors, and a location near public transit. Landscaping includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based HVAC system is more energy efficient and helps keep the temperature of the entire building more even and uses radiant heating and cooling. Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly sealants, carpets, paints, and adhesives as well as preventing 90% of the construction waste from entering landfills. Also, potable water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets. The contractor also recycled 90% of the materials from the building that previously occupied the site.|$|E
5|$|Identified world zinc {{resources}} total about 1.9–2.8 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States, {{with the}} largest reserves in Iran. The most recent estimate of reserve base for zinc (meets specified minimum physical criteria related to current mining and production practices) was made in 2009 and calculated to be roughly 480 Mt. Zinc reserves, on the other hand, are geologically identified ore bodies whose suitability for recovery is economically based (location, grade, quality, and quantity) {{at the time of}} determination. Since exploration and mine development is an ongoing process, the amount of zinc reserves is not a fixed number <b>and</b> <b>sustainability</b> of zinc ore supplies cannot be judged by simply extrapolating the combined mine life of today's zinc mines. This concept is well supported by data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which illustrates that although refined zinc production increased 80% between 1990 and 2010, the reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and scholars have estimated that about 109–305 million tonnes are in use.|$|E

5|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the sweep of}} botanical history it is evident that, {{through the power of}} the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, <b>and</b> <b>sustainability.</b>|$|E
