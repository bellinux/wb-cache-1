40|$|Final project aims {{to create}} 6 <b>Audio</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Input</b> Selector ATmega 8 Microcontroller Based. This tool is {{expected}} to serve to help the community to facilitate the operation of audio video selector switch without using a manual system. This tool was developed in several stages, namely, (1) Identification of Needs, (2) Needs Analysis, (3) Design System, (4) Hardware Design, (5) Design Software, (6) Technical Operations, and (7) testing Tool. The device is realized by combining several sisitem the power supply circuit, rellay, push button, 16 x 2 line LCD and microcontroller ATmega 8 as a processing unit. Software design as a control program on ATmega 8 microcontroller is using the C language compiler and software as its CVAVR. Testing of this tool by selecting one of six buttons to the desired menu to the next input will {{be connected to the}} audio video output. At the time the process is rellay serves as a link, each channel consists of three relays, each of which connects the right audio / righ, audio left / Left, and Video from input to output. For audio output amplifier can be connected to the voice / video amplifier to be connected while on TV, Viewer, or other video media viewer which has RCA jack input facilities. The tool also displays the current video audio text through media LCD viewer. After testing, it can be concluded that the tool can work according to plan. This tool can load six <b>audio</b> <b>video</b> <b>input</b> using RCA jacks...|$|E

The software also enables <b>audio</b> and <b>video</b> <b>input</b> on top of animation of characters and game elements.|$|R
30|$|Technological {{advances}} in wireless communication and data transmission have also rapidly progressed in recent years. Products, {{such as the}} iPhone (Apple, Inc.) have revolutionized the abilities of handheld phones and have made high-speed wireless transmission and reception of data via a 3 G network accurate and immediate. iPhone functionality is greatly enhanced with the installation of various applications. iCam (SKJM, LLC) is an application that streams live <b>audio</b> and <b>video</b> <b>input</b> from a webcam directly to an iPhone.|$|R
30|$|The ASR {{system we}} have used was {{originally}} proposed for processing Czech, a highly inflective Slavic language [12],[32], so it supports large vocabularies (it can operate with 500, 000 vocabulary items in the on-line mode). The inputs are converted via the FFmpeg codec to the standard 16 kHz pulse-code modulation (PCM) wave format (16 bits per sample), this way the system supports most <b>audio</b> (and <b>video)</b> <b>input</b> formats. The parametrization uses standard 39 -MFCC vectors computed on 20 ms frames with 10 ms overlap, and the feature vector is processed with the cepstral mean subtraction (CMS) normalization.|$|R
50|$|The {{output stages}} of both devices are similar, but the input stages are quite different. There is no {{baseband}} <b>audio</b> or <b>video</b> <b>input</b> to the translator. The translator receives an over-the air RF input signal {{by means of}} an antenna, just like a home receiver. Since received signal is already modulated {{there is no need for}} a modulator. Instead an input mixer or down-converter shifts the radio-frequency (RF) signal down to an intermediate-frequency (IF) signal. A second mixer (known as output mixer or up-converter) shifts the IF signal back up to the FM or TV band output signal frequency.|$|R
50|$|Building on this {{fundamental}} work, Gordon and his engineering teams later developed the first solid-state x-ray generator, the first quadrature-base band phased-array ultrasound system, {{and the first}} instant imaging computer-aided tomography system, among many other related inventions. These developments enabled subsequent advances in fields as diverse as aerospace telemetry, industrial control, communications, and many modern consumer products which rely on the digitization of analog measurement, <b>audio,</b> <b>video,</b> and optical <b>inputs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the model}} of DECstation, some systems were capable of {{performing}} <b>video</b> conferencing, high-quality <b>audio</b> output and <b>video</b> <b>input.</b> These were achieved through the use of TURBOchannel option modules and external peripherals. <b>Video</b> <b>input</b> was achieved by using the DECvideo (also known as the PIP (Picture-in-Picture) live-video-in) option, a daughterboard that plugs into the TX framebuffer to provide NTSC, PAL and SECAM input. When this option was used in conjunction with a video camera, a microphone and the required software, the DECstation can be used for video conferencing.|$|R

The model input information can either be the decoded <b>audio</b> and <b>video</b> (i.e., <b>input</b> to a signal-based model) or information extracted from the bitstream, or, in a more light-weight fashion, from transport-header information, requiring much lower processing resources. As input, our model takes parameters extracted from transport-header information, such as <b>audio</b> and <b>video</b> bitrates or packet-loss rates. A more detailed list of the employed parameters is given in the column [...] "Parameters" [...] of Table 2.|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{from recent}} psycholinguistic {{experiments}} suggests that humans resolve reference incrementally {{in the presence}} of constraining visual context. In this paper, we present and evaluate a computational model of human reference resolution that directly builds a semantic interpretation of an utterance without the need for a separate syntactic analysis phase, which typically involves the construction of parse trees. The model is implemented on a robot using real <b>audio</b> and <b>video</b> <b>inputs,</b> thus operates in real-time, and is distributed over several computers, which run in parallel. Results from experiments with the model confirm the viability of the algorithm to process semantic interpretations, in particular, reference incrementally, as demonstrated to be employed by humans. ...|$|R
50|$|Multi-channel RF {{modulators}} {{are commonly}} used in home audio/video distribution. These devices have multiple <b>audio</b> and <b>video</b> <b>inputs</b> and one RF output. Audio/video outputs from source devices such as a DVD player, VCR, or DSS receiver {{are connected to the}} audio/video inputs on the modulator. The modulator is then programmed to broadcast the signals on a certain frequency. That RF broadcast is then received by the connected TV. When the TV is tuned to the programmed channel, the <b>video</b> and <b>audio</b> signal of the source device is accessed. RF modulation can become difficult in a CATV system. High pass, low pass, and notch filters must be used to block certain frequencies, or channels, so that the modulator can broadcast the audio/video signal of the source device on that channel.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about the design and {{implemenation}} of a protocol to support scalable distributed multiparty virtual reality systems. The paper covers the service requirements for the protocol, the range of protocol semantics, and the congestion avoidance scheme proposed for use with such systems. The goal is to show how multicast {{can be used in}} a variety of ways to construct a novel system that can admit very large numbers of simulataneous participants in an heterogeneous network. 1 Introduction Distributed VR is a relatively new area of research. Virtual reality systems are now largely software components, rather than requiring the dedicated head-up-display input controllers and renderer hardware of the past. Current high-end workstations can now render scenes described in VRML and other languages in near real time. The introduction of <b>audio</b> and <b>video</b> <b>input</b> and output on desktop machines led to the deployment of software based multimedia conferencing, we expect to see the deployment of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We present recent {{developments}} in the openSMILE feature extraction toolkit. Version 2. 0 now unites feature extraction paradigms from speech, music, and general sound events with basic video features for multi-modal processing. De-scriptors from <b>audio</b> and <b>video</b> can be processed jointly in a single framework allowing for time synchronization of param-eters, on-line incremental processing as well as off-line and batch processing, and the extraction of statistical function-als (feature summaries), such as moments, peaks, regression parameters, etc. Postprocessing of the features includes sta-tistical classifiers such as support vector machine models or file export for popular toolkits such as Weka or HTK. Avail-able low-level descriptors include popular speech, music and video features including Mel-frequency and similar cepstral and spectral coefficients, Chroma, CENS, auditory model based loudness, voice quality, local binary pattern, color, and optical flow histograms. Besides, voice activity detection, pitch tracking and face detection are supported. openSMILE is implemented in C++, using standard open source libraries for on-line <b>audio</b> and <b>video</b> <b>input.</b> It is fast, runs on Unix and Windows platforms, and has a modular, component based architecture which makes extensions via plug-ins easy. openSMILE 2. 0 is distributed under a research license and can be downloaded fro...|$|R

40|$|Networks {{of smart}} ultra-portable devices are already {{indispensable}} in our lives, augment-ing our senses and connecting our lives through {{real time processing}} and communication of sensory (e. g., <b>audio,</b> <b>video,</b> location) <b>inputs.</b> Though usually hidden from the user’s sight, the engineering of these devices involves fierce tradeoffs between energy availability (battery sizes impact portability) and signal processing / communication capability (which impacts the "smartness " of the devices). The goal of this dissertation {{is to provide a}} fun-damental understanding and characterization of these tradeoffs {{in the context of a}} sensor network, where the goal is to estimate a common signal by coordinating a multitude of battery-powered sensor nodes. Most of the research so far has been based on two key as-sumptions –"distributed processing " and "temporal independence " – that lend analytical tractability to the problem but otherwise are often found lacking in practice. This disser-tation introduces novel techniques to relax these assumptions – leading to vastly efficient energy usage in typical networks (up to 20 % savings) and new insights on the quality of inference. For example, the phenomenon of sensor drift is ubiquitous in applications suc...|$|R
5000|$|The new AV {{machines}} {{were some of}} the first to ship standard with an internal CD-ROM drive (earlier Quadra and Centris models were available with the built-in CD-ROM drive as optional extras). The Quadra 840av was the first Apple computer to come with an internal CD-ROM standard. The operating system installation package came on CD-ROM rather than a series of floppy disks whenever the CD-ROM drive was included. A hidden QuickTime video included on the original Quadra 840AV/Centris 660AV [...] "Install Me First" [...] CD-ROM, shows the jubilant Cyclone / Tempest design team in the midst of celebrating their accomplishment. In this video, a Cyclone (840AV) prototype logic board is shown. The logic board is fitted with a 25 MHz 68040, a number of rework wires, and most conspicuously, a daughter card nicknamed [...] "Karma", on which the <b>audio</b> and <b>video</b> input/output ports are located. Notably, the <b>audio</b> and <b>video</b> ports on the card are front-facing, positioned as though they would protrude from an opening in the lower front of the case, where they are more easily accessible to the user. According to a member of the team, the [...] "AV on a card" [...] feature was omitted, because there was not enough room for it in the case. Coinciding with the introduction of both AV Macs, Apple introduced the Apple AudioVision 14 Display, featuring easily accessible audio <b>input,</b> <b>audio</b> output and <b>video</b> <b>input</b> ports of its own, which could be fed by an ADC adapter cable connected with the rear AV ports of the AV Macs.|$|R

50|$|Video for Windows {{was first}} {{introduced}} in November 1992 {{as a reaction to}} Apple Computer's QuickTime technology which added digital video to Macintosh. Costing around $200, the software included editing and encoding programs for use with <b>video</b> <b>input</b> boards. A runtime version for viewing videos only was also made available. Originally released as a free add-on to Windows 3.1 and Windows 3.11, it then became an integral component of Windows 95 and later. Like QuickTime there were three components in Video for Windows. The technology introduced a file format designed to store digital <b>video,</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Video</b> Interleave (AVI). The technology provided an application programming interface that allowed Windows software developers to add the ability to play or manipulate digital video to their own applications. Lastly, it included a suite of software for playing and manipulating digital video.|$|R
