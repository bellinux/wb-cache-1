25|$|Unlike {{some other}} places visited on Mars with landers (Viking and Pathfinder), {{nearly all the}} rocks near Phoenix are small. For <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> the camera can see, the land is flat, but shaped into polygons between 2–3 meters in {{diameter}} and are bounded by troughs that are 20cm to 50cm deep. These shapes are due to ice in the soil expanding and contracting due to major temperature changes. The microscope showed that the soil {{on top of the}} polygons is composed of flat particles (probably a type of clay) and rounded particles. Also, unlike other places visited on Mars, the site has no ripples or dunes.O at the Phoenix Landing Site. 2009. Science:325. p58-61 Ice is present a few inches below the surface {{in the middle of the}} polygons, and along its edges, the ice is at least 8inches deep. When the ice is exposed to the Martian atmosphere it slowly sublimates. Some dust devils were observed.|$|E

500|$|Hal Hinson of The Washington Post was unimpressed {{with the}} film, calling it Jarmusch's [...] "least engaging, {{and the first}} in which his bohemian posturing {{actually}} becomes an irritant". Of the film's characters, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote that some were [...] "beautifully imagined and realized, while others seem drawn from a more familiar stockpile, designed for reuse rather than discovery". David Denby, concluding a mixed review of the film for New York Magazine, mused that [...] "one feels Jarmusch has pushed hipsterism and cool <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> they can go, and that isn't nearly far enough." [...] This reproach was echoed by other reviewers who found that the film's style did not stray far {{from that of the}} director's earlier work – a critical backlash that would be amplified two years later following the release of Night On Earth (1991).|$|E
500|$|Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998) uses {{hand-held}} camera, sound design, staging {{and increased}} audio-visual detail to defamiliarise viewers accustomed to conventional combat films, {{so as to}} create what film historian Stuart Bender calls [...] "reported realism", {{whether or not the}} portrayal is genuinely more realistic. Jeanine Basinger notes that critics experienced it as [...] "groundbreaking and anti-generic", with, in James Wolcott's words, a [...] "desire to bury the cornball, recruiting poster legend of John Wayne: to get it right this time"; and that combat films have always been [...] "grounded in the need to help an audience understand and accept war". Its success revived interest in World War II films. Others tried to portray the reality of the war, as in [...] Joseph Vilsmaier's Stalingrad (1993), which The New York Times said [...] "goes <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> a movie can go in depicting modern warfare as a stomach-turning form of mass slaughter." ...|$|E

500|$|Garland {{began writing}} Dredd during {{post-production}} {{of his other}} writing credit Sunshine, and completed his first draft while serving as an executive producer during filming of 28 Weeks Later. Garland's draft revolved around one of Dredd's main enemies, the undead Judge Death. He described the story as a [...] "riff on the whole Judge system", but {{that it did not}} work because the Judge system had not yet been established and required too much knowledge about the Judge Dredd comic from the audience. He also considered the end result too surreal and extreme. From this script, Garland decided that the story needed to be more focused and grounded. He instead considered adapting some of the notable Judge Dredd storylines, including [...] "Democracy" [...] (1986) and [...] "Origins" [...] (2006). He decided to avoid these lengthy tales in favour of a shorter, day-in-the-life story about Dredd and his function as a cop in the dystopian environment of Mega-City One. When developing the Judge Dredd character, Garland tried to closely follow that of the comic-book character, who undergoes only small personality changes over a lengthy period of time. He said: [...] "I didn't think Dredd could have a great epiphany, but there is definitely a change in him {{over the course of the}} movie. He makes a very clear statement at the beginning of the film which he then contradicts at the end. That's <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> the shift goes." [...] Garland intentionally gave the traditional character development to Anderson to compensate for Dredd's character stability.|$|E

2500|$|To {{camouflage}} preparations, {{the eleven}} merchantmen were loaded at Alexandria, Port Said, Suez, Haifa and Beirut, rendezvousing at Port Said and Haifa.

Escorted by Coventry and eight s, MW11c was to simulate the Malta convoy and steam <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> the Tobruk meridian and turn back to rendezvous with the remainder. It was hoped that the decoy operation would lure out the Italian fleet, which would be exposed to attack and run short of fuel before the main convoy sailed.

In a 2014 speech to a Vatican conference, Bannon made a passing reference to Julius Evola, a twentieth-century, Nazi-linked Italian writer who influenced Benito Mussolini's Italian Fascism and promoted the Traditionalist School, described by a New York Times writer as [...] "a worldview popular in far-right and alternative religious circles that believes progress and equality are poisonous illusions." [...] In March 2016, Bannon stated he appreciates [...] "any piece that mentions Evola." [...] In referring to the associated views of Vladimir Putin, who is influenced by Evola follower Dugin, Bannon stated [...] "We, the Judeo-Christian West, really {{have to look at what}} he's talking <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Traditionalism goes— particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism." [...] He has likewise quoted French anti-Enlightenment writer Charles Maurras approvingly to a French diplomat. Bannon has also repeatedly referenced the controversial 1973 French novel The Camp of the Saints, which depicts immigration destroying Western civilization. He has embraced what BBC News describes as Savitri Devi's [...] "account of history as a cyclical battle between good and evil".|$|E
