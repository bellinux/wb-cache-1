25|$|Relations {{between the}} Sinhala populace, {{including}} the Kandyan aristocracy, and the Nayakkars remained fraught throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries. As early as Narendrasinha's reign, attempts at appointing Nayakkars to prominent positions in court had caused rebellion, {{including one in}} 1732 that the king had only been able to crush with Dutch assistance. The Nayakkar nobility – which tended to be exclusivist and monopolise access to the king – was seen as forming an elite group privileged above the native aristocracy, the powerful adigars. Though Sri Vijaya Rajasinha's reign (1739–1747) proved relatively peaceful, his successor Kirti Sri Rajasinha {{had to deal with}} two major rebellions. The first, in 1749, was directed <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> Narenappa; the second, in 1760, was a far more dangerous insurrection which attempted to replace him with a Siamese prince. Despite these tensions, however, the Nayakkar dynasty endured, establishing support by their patronage of Buddhism and Kandyan culture.|$|E

500|$|Roshan {{considered}} quitting {{the film}} industry after two assailants fired bullets <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> in 2000. Later that December, {{he was involved in}} a controversy when Nepalese newspapers accused him of stating in a Star Plus interview that he hated Nepal and its people. This led to protests in the country, a ban on screening of his films, and four people's deaths after street violence. Nepalese people threatened to [...] "bury [...] alive" [...] if he ever visited the country. Star Plus, for its part, stated that Roshan [...] "did not touch upon Nepal". The violence calmed down after Roshan wrote a two-page rejoinder in which he denied having made any claim against the country and actress Manisha Koirala helped distribute it to newspapers and a local television station.|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Deep, Deep Trouble" [...] {{illustrates}} the things Bart raps {{about in the}} song, showing how he is forced by Homer to mow the lawn after throwing a buzzing alarm clock <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> in his sleep. When Homer tells Bart to hurry up, Bart accidentally runs over the sprinkler {{and as a result}} he has to stay at home when the family goes to see a boat show. After they leave, Bart decides to throw a party and invites his friends. They make a mess in the house and when Homer and Marge return home, Bart realizes he is in deep trouble. Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post thought the video was not [...] "nearly as clever as the cartoon" [...] and that it had [...] "'promotional gimmick' written all over it." [...] "Then again, I never thought the video of the dance rap 'Do the Bartman' would be a ratings hit when it aired in December. So what do I know?", she added.|$|E
500|$|Chief Wiggum, P.I. is a cop-drama {{spin-off}} and {{a parody}} of Magnum, P.I., which follows Chief Wiggum, Ralph and Seymour Skinner. Chief Wiggum and his son Ralph move to New Orleans with Seymour Skinner as Wiggum's sidekick. Wiggum has proclaimed that he will [...] "clean up the city" [...] of New Orleans, {{but it does not}} take long before he meets his nemesis, Big Daddy, who warns Wiggum to stay out of his business. Soon after, Ralph disappears and Wiggum finds Big Daddy's calling card left behind. Wiggum manages to track Big Daddy's ransom call to the Mardi Gras, where he briefly runs into the Simpson family, [...] and the two chase each other to Big Daddy's mansion in the New Orlans bayou (in reality the Louisiana governor's mansion which Big Daddy has managed to steal). Chief Wiggum then threatens Big Daddy with a gun, but Big Daddy counters by tossing Ralph <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> then jumping out the window and swimming away (at an extremely slow speed, due to his weight). Wiggum ultimately lets the villain escape, feeling that he will meet him again [...] "each and every week, always in more sexy and exciting ways".|$|E

500|$|Bruce {{has been}} married since February 1983 to Janet (née Smith), who is also from the Hexham area, {{and went to the}} same school as Bruce. The couple have two children, Alex (born 1984) and Amy (born 1987). Alex is also a footballer, and was signed by his father for Hull City in July 2012. He had {{previously}} played under his father's management at Birmingham City, but left the club in 2006, in part due to accusations of nepotism levelled <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>father.</b> Amy was linked romantically with Aston Villa player Lee Hendrie in tabloid newspaper stories in 2004, which provoked an angry response from her father, who described the reports as [...] "lies", and claimed that journalists had {{gone so far as to}} contact his doctor and examine his household waste in an attempt to uncover gossip. In September 2004, Bruce was involved in an altercation outside his home with two men who were attempting to steal his daughter's car. The affray left him with facial injuries but did not prevent him from travelling to a Premier League match the same day. After the incident one newspaper attempted to connect it with the allegations concerning Hendrie, leading Bruce to contemplate legal action.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics, {{many of whom}} praised the case-of-the-week and the character development of Dick Casablancas. Eric Goldman of IGN graded the episode an 8.8 out of 10, indicating that it was [...] "great". He lauded the episode's handling of its political subject matter {{and the return of}} older storylines. He argued that [...] "I Know What You'll Do Next Summer" [...] used its political message much better than [...] "Un-American Graffiti", which aired two weeks prior; he thought that this episode's story made its political message more subtle than the previous episode. The reviewer also enjoyed the development of Dick's character that occurred with the return of his father, stating that the scene in which Dick yelled <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> [...] "an excellent moment that helped bring a lot of new shading to the funny, but usually one-note character." [...] Keith's storyline was another center of praise, with the reviewer stating that he thought the Fitzpatricks' plot line had been too rushed earlier in the season. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly was generally positive as well, noting the romantic uncertainty between Veronica and Piz, Logan and Parker, and Mac and Max, drawing parallels between this aspect of the episode and the series' uncertain future. In addition, the reviewer thought highly of Dick's confrontation with his father and the case-of-the-week. Television Without Pity graded the episode a [...] "B+".|$|E
500|$|Nick is {{described}} by the soap opera's official website as often thinking [...] "with his heart instead of his head". When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a [...] "frisky" [...] 16-year-old [...] "rich-kid", with Morrow being able to [...] "kick back and relax in typical teenager attire—jeans, tees, etc". Morrow said [...] "Nick's eager and fun-loving ... and that's fun to play". Nick also has an [...] "eye for the ladies". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow has insisted {{that he is not}} concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My job is not to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can only imagine what that must be like." [...] The actor felt that if he needed to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not that big of a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy who looks <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> in this hero light anymore." [...] By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now [...] "more mature" [...] with his decision-making, and that [...] "He's got a very practical view of the world, and I like that he's kind of become a steady character on the show". He stated that although the part isn't as [...] "splashy or flashy" [...] as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he [...] "really" [...] likes Nick because [...] "he's a good dude" [...] and a [...] "very supportive" [...] person.|$|E
