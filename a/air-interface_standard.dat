50|$|The {{success of}} the {{unlicensed}} band in accommodating a range of wireless devices and services has led the FCC to consider opening further bands for unlicensed use. In contrast, the licensed bands are underutilized due to static frequency allocation. Realizing that CR technology {{has the potential to}} exploit the inefficiently utilized licensed bands without causing interference to incumbent users, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making which would allow unlicensed radios to operate in the TV-broadcast bands. The IEEE 802.22 working group, formed in November 2004, is tasked with defining the <b>air-interface</b> <b>standard</b> for wireless regional area networks (based on CR sensing) for the operation of unlicensed devices in the spectrum allocated to TV service. To comply with later FCC regulations on unlicensed utilization of TV spectrum, the IEEE 802.22 has defined interfaces to the mandatory TV White Space Database in order to avoid interference to incumbent services.|$|E
40|$|Internet {{access and}} the {{emergence}} of multimedia applications are leading towards a new area of broadband wireless networks. This paper focuses on HiperLAN 2 <b>air-interface</b> <b>standard</b> based on an “all-IP ” network architecture. An appropriate QoS framework is proposed, based on which, classification and scheduling mechanisms of traffic classes are investigated. These could be considered as potential enhancements and compliments to the MAC protocol of HiperLAN 2 for providing end-to-end QoS. I...|$|E

50|$|Mindspeed’s {{products}} {{are used in}} wireless infrastructure and small cell base-stations. The company's ARM-based processing solutions include low-power, multi-core digital signal processor system-on-chip (SoC) products for fixed and mobile (3G/4G) carrier infrastructure (the Transcede family) and Picochip's SoCs for 3G (HSPA) femtocells and small cells. Mindspeed announced the Transcede family of wireless baseband processors in 2010, including the single-core Transcede 3000, which serves the eNodeB processing needs of a picocell, while consuming less than 10 watts (W) of power, and the dual-core Transcede 4000, which delivers three sectors of LTE processing for macro cells serving thousands of subscribers. The Transcede 4000 integrates 26 programmable processors into a single device, including two ARM® Cortex A9® multi-core symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) {{reduced instruction set computer}} (RISC) processors, 10 CEVA (digital signal processors (DSPs) and 10 DSP accelerators, enabling equipment manufacturers to fully support the complete processing needs of single- and multi-sector base stations using the WCDMA/HSPA, LTE, LTE time-division duplex (TD-LTE), time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA, in China) and other <b>air-interface</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} of the wireless industry from second generation (2 G) to third generation (3 G) {{is more than}} a simple technology upgrade. The industry's service profile will move far beyond telephony and services will converge with the computing and content sectors. This will bring many more players into this already huge industry. Thus the transition to 3 G needs to be regarded as a major economic transformation as it requires a major reconfiguration of the existing value networks. Standards have traditionally been essential in the success of wireless services and will play an increasingly critical role in the future. Due to the on-going transition, wireless standardization has changed considerably [...] reflecting changes in the configuration of the value network. While the number of major <b>air-interface</b> <b>standards</b> has been reduced to just two, the overall number of standards bodies has increased by almost an order of magnitude while the number and scope of interfaces being standardized has grown at a breathtaking pace. This growth reflects the need to support the industry's new coordination requirements at critical interfaces in the value network. At the same time, the importance of the traditional standards development organizations (SDOs) has diminished as more nimble industry consortia have taken over the main responsibilities for standardization. The major standardization battlegrounds have shifted up the protocol stack to the service enabler level. In addition, the manufacture of handsets and other mobile communication devices is transitioning to a more horizontal industry structure. These changes, along with changes in the way value is extracted from new services and their influence on the reconfiguration of the industry are discussed. 3 G Wireless Mobile Standards...|$|R
