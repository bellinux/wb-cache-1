The cave environment is created by caverns - relicts after mouldered <b>ankerites</b> and siderites in surroundings of Palaeozoic slates, limestones and dolomites. The residual ochre loams were created by weathering of carbonates. Probably, these processes held up till now and this fact may also result in the liberation of CO 2.

An enhanced CO 2 content was also measured in old air-proof closed mine workings, with a possibility of rot processes of old organic mine working components.

A metasomatic column (or metasomatic zone pattern) is the {{complete}} sequence of metasomatic zones characterising an individual metasomatic facies (Zharikov et al. 2007). The genesis of this column {{is the result}} of a series of processes, in the case of basic rock protolith leading to the formation of apobasite listvenites (in the sense of Sazonov 1975). It includes three partial processes: 1) carbonatization, 2) silicification and 3) formation of mica (e. g. Plissart et al. 2009) involving the infiltration of a CO 2 -rich fluids and shows similarity to processes of listvenitisation (e. g. Clayton 1993). Field research in Slovinky-Gelnica ore field has revealed the presence of such a metasomatic column (cf. Ivan 1987). It comprises metabasites as the protolith, carbonatised metabasites, listvenite-type metasomatites and listvenites s. s. The metabasites have features of subvolcanic rock types (Ivan 2009), what makes them comparable with similar rocks from Ural. The petrographic study of selected samples has showed that amphibole, chlorite and albite became progressively unstable in this sequence of alterations, replaced by carbonate, silica and lastly by the muscovite minerals, sericite or fuchsite (Ivan 1987). Carbonates change their quantity as well as mineralogical composition with the development of the column in two trends of changes: towards Mg-Fe carbonates or Mg-Ca carbonates. Regarding the samples from Ural, Fe-dolomites and <b>ankerites</b> predominate, the metasomatic columns derived from gabbros and dolerites are essentially the same. The geochemical study of rock samples from the study area (22 whole rock analyses) as well as the comparison with similarly metasomatised rock series from Ural (56 analyses) allowed as to give more detailed characterization of the metasomatic column. The most obvious change is a clear increase of K with decreasing Na as a sign of the albite break-up and Krich minerals (such as muscovite) formation. The increase of LOI and CO 2 indicate the process of carbonatisation. Listvenitisation is often associated with the hydrothermal ore veins formation and the rare metal mineralization with concentration of elements such as Au, Co, Sb, Cu, Ni (e. g. Dinel et al. 2008, Buckman & Ashley 2010). This could be significant as regards the genesis of stratiform ore deposits within the Slovinky-Gelnica ore field. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

40|$|Loulo is a {{world-class}} orogenic gold district in SW Mali. The mininig district {{is comprised of}} two major operational mines at Yalea (6. 5 Moz at 4. 7 g/t) and Gara (3. 7 Moz at 4. 1 g/t), plus numerous satellite deposits and other prospective targets, which takes Loulo's overall resource to 14. 4 Moz. Two distinct types of ore deposit are recognised. Gara-style deposits are Fe-rich and characterised by a Fe-Cu-REE-Au-Ni-W-As ± Co-Ag-Pd metal association. Yalea-style, As-rich, deposits exhibit more typical orogenic gold features with a metal signature consisting of Fe-As-Cu-W-Au-Pb-Sb-Ag. Investigations into the source and composition of the auriferous fluids indicate two styles of ore fluid were responsible for mineralisation: (1) a 'Gara-style' oxidised (FM-buffered), high temperature (> 400 °C), hypersaline (35 - 55 wt. % NaCl equiv.), Na-Fe-Cl-B-bearing magmatic fluid; and (2) a 'Yalea-style' reduced (QFM-buffered), lower temperature (300 - 350 °C), low-salinity (< 10 wt. % NaCl equiv.) C 0 [sub] 2 -N[sub] 2 -H[sub] 2 S-rich metamorphic fluid. The identification of hypersaline Na-Fe chloride-rich fluid inclusions questions the metamorphic fluid paradigm for orogenic gold deposits. Field, petrographic and isotopic studies also provide convincing evidence that magmatic fluids played an integral role in gold mineralisation. These include: (1) {{the presence of a}} significant boron anomaly {{along the length of the}} Senegal-Mali Shear Zone (which hosts Loulo and other large gold deposits such as Sadiola), typified in Loulo by the presence of large volumes of replacive epigenetic tourmaline; (2) widespread pink sodic alteration; (3) the spatial association with iron oxide-copper-gold (IOCG) deposits in the adjacent Falémé district in Senegal; (4) the presence of Ni-Co sulphides and abundant REE-W minerals in the ore paragenetic assemblage; and (5) carbon isotopes overlapping the magmatic field (e. g. Gara vein <b>ankerites</b> show [delta][sup] 13 C compositions from - 14. 4 to - 4. 5 %). Both metamorphic and magmatic fluids were capable of carrying gold as either bi-sulphide complexes or oxidised chloride complexes, respectively. In the Gara-style orebodies, mineralisation was controlled by the mixing of these two fluids, which resulted in changes in temperature, pH and f 0 [sub] 2, and caused retrograde boiling ofthe CO[sub] 2 component. This style of Loulo orebody contains distinct mineralogical and fluid inclusion characteristics, and it is therefore proposed that Gara-style orebodies represent a new sub-class of orogenic gold deposit, with evidence suggesting possible links with IOCG/skarn mineralisation. In the Yalea-style orebodies, mineralisation is confined to metamorphic fluids with the principal mineralisation trap linked to fluid immiscibility during fluctuations in pressure and/or temperature, and fluid-rock interactions with reduced host sediments. Chemisorption processes may also have played a role in gold deposition to account for the high levels of refractory gold in arsenopyrite.

30|$|Coal is {{the largest}} fossil fuel abundantly {{distributed}} {{in many parts of}} the world. The demand of energy and the depletion of high-quality coal, so more attention is focused on utilization of the low- grade coal. The low-grade coal has a serious deficiency to utilization because it associated with high mineral matter content and moisture content. The origin of Indian coal is heterogeneous in nature and consists of the complex mixture of organic (carbon) and inorganic (minerals) constituents (Georgakopoulos et al. 2003). The use of low-grade coal in large-scale unit leads to environmental pollution due to generation of the solid wastes and gaseous pollutants. It causes the increase cost of the power plants, reduce the efficiency and produces technical difficulties during processes and production steps (Meshram et al. 2015). It is necessary to demineralize and desulphurize such coal before using in thermal power station, steel plants, or cement industries, etc. The major minerals commonly found in coal are quartz and other forms of silica, clay mineral, pyrites and carbonates such as siderites and <b>ankerites</b> (Mukherjee and Borthakur 2001). The coal ash formed from mineral matter is both organic and inorganic in nature. High ash (>[*] 20 % weight) coal is rich with mineral content such as quartz, illite, calcite, pyrite, gypsum, and elements like H, N, S and oxygen. The high ash coal is always enriched with oxides of SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3, and K 2 O (Ciu et al. 2015). The cleaning of coal can be achieved by both physical and chemical method (Gulen et al. 2005). The degree of demineralization of coal by various method mostly depends on the percentage and composition of mineral matter, their types, and association within the raw coal. The physical methods are based on the difference in their physical properties (specific gravity and surface properties) of the minerals and the carbonaceous part of the coal (Behera et al. 2017 a, b). The chemical method involve treatment with different chemical solvent are used for removing mineral matter, like the finely distributed mineral and those bound strongly to the coal matrix (Ma et al. 2014). The purpose of beneficiation of a low-grade coal is to reduce inert content for easy transportation, minimize abrasive materials and to improve the combustion qualities. The combustion properties of coal like heating value, volatile matter content that govern the performance of coal have a clear dependence on ash, maceral composition. Therefore, more emphasis is given for the cleaning method of coal so that it may minimize the mineral matter and improve the quality of coal. However, chemical cleaning processes are more expensive than physical cleaning steps in terms of total cost (Dash et al. 2015 a, b). The chemical beneficiation methods are include acid leaching, alkali leaching, acid leaching followed by alkali leaching or alkali leaching followed by acid leaching and leaching by molten caustic treatment. The coal cleaning by the chemical method is a simple process when it is operates under mild condition. Chemical leaching process usually achieved remove all types of minerals from the coal compared to physical treatment method. Although, chemical cleaning method has not been widely employed on a commercial scale due to huge cost related to the requirement of chemical and need for dewatering and regeneration of reagents from spent solution (Wu and Steel 2007; Waugh and Bowling 1984; Ryberg et al. 2015; Sriramoju et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|Weathering processes, {{governed by}} {{dissolution}} kinetics {{as well as}} by the rates and directions of flowing water, are important mechanisms through which solutes are added to watersheds. Flow pathways control the fate and transport of incoming precipitation inputs and consequently, influence water-rock interactions, degrees of weathering, and distributions of solutes in watersheds. Furthermore, plants directly impact the availability of solutes in soil and porewater reservoirs through infiltration, evapotranspiration, decomposition, and preferential discrimination processes. To this end, strontium isotope ratios (87 Sr/ 86 Sr), elemental ratios (Ca/Sr, Ge/Si), and elemental concentrations are used to document sources of solutes at a temperate forested, shale catchment in central Pennsylvania. Spatio-temporal patterns are assessed and inferences are developed using empirical data supplemented by observations on mineral weathering, proposed preferential flow pathways, and plant transport mechanisms at the catchment. In particular, this study entails a comprehensive analysis of calcium, strontium, silicon, and germanium sources in plant leaves and sap waters and in streamwaters, groundwaters, soil porewaters, exchangeable soils, and bedrock in order to investigate hydrological (preferential flow pathways), topographical (hillslope geometry), biological (evapotranspiration, decomposition, and plant preferential discrimination), and mineralogical (dominant weathering inputs) controls on their availability and distribution at the watershed. For soils and soil porewaters, spatial patterns in chemistry largely reflect lateral and vertical preferential flow processes which influence solute residence times and the transfer of weathering products either in the soil profile or to downslope locations. As such, topographic gradient plays a circumstantial role in lateral subsurface transport processes downslope. Furthermore, biological activities including plant preferential discrimination, decomposition, and evapotranspiration impact near surface spatial patterns and in particular, temporal patterns in soil and soil porewater chemistry. Although solutes in soils and soil porewaters at ridge top and mid slope locations are largely derived from silicate mineral weathering, influences of carbonate dissolution processes on calcium and strontium are rather significant at valley floor locations where recharge of carbonate affected groundwaters is probable. Strontium isotope ratios in soil reservoirs correspond closely to those in leaves which is consistent with the rapid homogenization of solutes added from weathering and atmospheric sources by biological nutrient cycling processes. Controls on spatio-temporal patterns in leaf and sap water chemistry are predictably similar to those observed for soils and soil porewaters, from which these reservoir components are largely acquiring solutes. However, plant transport mechanisms through the xylem are also important where apoplastic passive transport is suggested for calcium and strontium, while a coexistence of active and passive transport mechanisms either through apoplastic or symplastic pathways is hypothesized for silicon and germanium. As to the site of elemental partitioning, minimal discrepancy between leaf and sap water Ge/Si ratios, where Ge/Si ratios for both are significantly lower than those for soil porewaters, suggests that partitioning between germanium and silicon precedes phytolith formation and occurs in the transport from the endodermal cell layer (and casparian strip) to the xylem stream either during plant uptake or soon thereafter. Conversely, Ca/Sr ratios in sap waters are shown to correspond more closely to those in soil porewaters with elemental partitioning occurring further down the transpiration stream as supported by observations of significantly higher Ca/Sr ratios in leaves compared to soil porewaters. Groundwater and streamwater chemistry is largely governed by mineralogical processes. In groundwaters and weir streamwaters, carbonate dissolution processes are shown to be rather important sources of calcium and strontium, while primary weathering of silicate minerals imparts influences on silicon and germanium chemistry. However, stream headwaters are ephemeral and highly responsive to inputs from atmospheric sources for calcium and strontium and to hydrological processes which add silicon and germanium to streamwaters through flushing by infiltrating precipitation of soil porewaters into streamwaters at these locations. Mid streamwaters integrate sources of solutes at weir and stream headwater locations. Diagenetic carbonates at the catchment are reflective of both <b>ankerites</b> and calcites with carbonates at the ridge and valley likely originating from different strata as a result of the heterogeneous lithology of the Rose Hill formation. The rate of carbonate propagation well exceeds those estimated for regolith production and erosion and is consistent with the greater depth inferred for the carbonate weathering front at the catchment. Strontium isotope ratios for silicate fractions of drill core samples suggest that bedrock is, indeed, shale and that calcium and strontium release through weathering is likely from leaching of less radiogenic feldspars at interlayer and adsorption sites of clay minerals. Furthermore, Ge/Si ratios for drill core samples agree to values for shale where silicon and germanium release through primary weathering of silicate minerals is supported by observations of lower Ge/Si ratios, relative to unweathered bedrock, in streamwaters, groundwaters, and soil porewaters unaffected by plant activities. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|R
