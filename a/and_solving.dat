5|$|In {{computer}} science, the clique {{problem is}} the computational problem of finding cliques (subsets of vertices, all adjacent to each other, also called complete subgraphs) in a graph. It has several different formulations depending on which cliques, and what information about the cliques, should be found. Common formulations of the clique problem include finding a maximum clique (a clique with the largest possible number of vertices), finding a maximum weight clique in a weighted graph, listing all maximal cliques (cliques that cannot be enlarged), <b>and</b> <b>solving</b> the decision problem of testing whether a graph contains a clique larger than a given size.|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} must resolve a murder mystery by searching for clues, {{exploring}} different areas, interacting with characters, <b>and</b> <b>solving</b> item-based puzzles. The game features first-person graphics, nonlinear gameplay, an open world, conversations with non-player characters, branching dialogue choices, suspect interrogations, nonlinear storytelling, and plot twists. The Famicom version {{also features a}} command menu system, point-and-click interface, and 3D dungeon maze. Upon its release, The Portopia Serial Murder Incident was well received in Japan. It became an influential title and helped define the visual novel genre.|$|E
5|$|Mysts story {{concerns}} {{an explorer}} named Atrus {{who has the}} ability to write books which serve as links to other worlds, known as Ages. This practice of creating linking books was developed by an ancient civilization known as the D'ni, whose society crumbled after being ravaged by disease. The player takes the role of an unnamed person referred to as the Stranger and assists Atrus by traveling to other Ages <b>and</b> <b>solving</b> puzzles. Over the course of the series Atrus writes a new Age for the D'ni survivors to live on, and players of the games set the course the civilization will follow.|$|E

5|$|The Game Boy Advance version shares basic {{elements}} with its console counterparts. Displayed from a side-scrolling view, the Prince navigates {{the palace of}} Azad using his acrobatic skills. The Rewind ability is still present to save the Prince's life, and is also involved in solving some puzzles and fighting bosses. New moves and abilities are gained by the Prince by performing moves <b>and</b> <b>solving</b> puzzles. Farah is featured as a second playable character in some sections, with switching between the two being key to some puzzles. The mobile version is similarly a side-scroller, featuring simple puzzles and traps. The powers linked to the Sands are absent, but enemies must still be killed by stabbing them with the Dagger. There are three enemy types: archers, flying enemies, and foot soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is an action-adventure {{game for}} the Wii home console, {{developed}} and published by Nintendo. The sixteenth mainline entry in The Legend of Zelda series, it was released worldwide in November 2011. Taking the role of series protagonist Link, players navigate the skies around the floating island of Skyloft and the land below it, completing quests that advance the story <b>and</b> <b>solving</b> environmental and dungeon-based puzzles. Gameplay mechanics and combat, the latter focusing on attacking and blocking with sword and shield, are reliant on the Wii MotionPlus expansion device.|$|E
5|$|He also gains {{the ability}} to constrict objects and enemies with a band of energy, {{although}} this feature {{was one of the}} few abilities not to feature in future games. Players can find an ancient relic that gives Raziel the power to fire bolts of telekinetic energy, which cause little damage by themselves but can knock enemies into hazards and push objects from a distance. Baptism in holy flame can transform the Soul Reaver into the Fire Reaver, which can set enemies aflame and adds fire to Raziel's telekinetic bolts. Players can also find magical glyphs that allow Raziel to expend magical energy to attack groups of enemies simultaneously. These glyphs typically involve vampire weaknesses such as sunlight, fire, water, or sound, as well as additions such as telekinetic force (available well before the normal telekinesis becomes available) and the causing of earthquakes to temporarily stun enemies. Glyphs are acquired through finding glyph altars, specific locations in Nosgoth where the skills can be learned, <b>and</b> <b>solving</b> a puzzle before being granted the magical ability. However, Raziel begins the game with access to the 'Shift' glyph, granting {{the ability to}} shift between the material and spectral planes, with no glyph altar necessary.|$|E

5|$|In between Novel {{sections}} are Escape sections, which {{occur when}} the player finds themselves in a room from which they need to find the means of escape. These are presented from a first-person perspective, with the player being able to move between different pre-determined positions in each room. To escape, the player is tasked with finding various items <b>and</b> <b>solving</b> puzzles, reminiscent of escape-the-room games. At some points, the player may need to combine objects {{with each other to}} create the necessary tool to complete a puzzle. The puzzles include various brain teasers, such as baccarat and magic squares. An in-game calculator is provided for math-related problems, and the player can ask characters for hints if they find an Escape room too difficult. All Escape sections are self-contained, with all items required to solve the puzzles being available within that section; items are not carried over between Escape sections. After finishing an Escape section, it becomes available to replay from the game's main menu.|$|E
5|$|Rise of the Warrior was {{a graphic}} novel by Marianne Krawczyk with art by Christopher Shy. Only {{available}} on GodofWar.com, {{it was a}} prequel story that tied into Ascensions single-player and multiplayer modes, and had 20 chapters that were released from October 2012 to March 2013. It also featured a social experience during that same time period. For the social experience, players were aligned with either the Spartans or the Trojans and competed via social challenges to earn points, such as answering questions <b>and</b> <b>solving</b> riddles for each chapter. In the first challenge, the teams competed to earn their army a week of exclusive, early access to the multiplayer beta test that began on December 12, and a one-month subscription to PlayStation Plus, which was won by the Spartans; the Trojans received access on December 17. The Spartans also won the next team challenge and received early access to the Prison of the Damned single-player demo on February 20, 2013. Players could also earn early, in-game unlocks for the final game's multiplayer mode, including exclusive weapons and armor for all players who attained the rank of Champion of the Gods.|$|E
