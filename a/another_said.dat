5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} defence to {{question}} the court's jurisdiction, several witnesses were questioned {{over a period of}} several weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal to focus on the case at hand. Further witnesses, including a key witness for the prosecution, came across as unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which they had made before the trial. Other witnesses for the prosecution, including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because he was at home on the night of 13 August. <b>Another</b> <b>said</b> that the steel pipe said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it.|$|E
25|$|Al-Bassa was {{captured}} by Yishuv's Haganah forces during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, in Operation Ben-Ami, on May 14, 1948. Al-Bassa's defenders were local militia men. Following its capture, the Haganah's Palmach forces concentrated the villagers in the local church where they shot and killed a number of youths before chasing the villagers out. One witness to the expulsion {{said that it was}} preceded by soldiers shooting and killing five villagers inside the church, while <b>another</b> <b>said</b> seven villagers were shot and killed by soldiers outside the church.|$|E

He was summoned back into Bvute's office and warned {{that it was a}} take-it-or-leave-it offer: this player was later revealed to be Anthony Ireland. <b>Another</b> <b>said</b> that when he told Bvute he wanted to consult with friends, Bvute {{picked up the phone and}} called Kenyon Ziehl, the head of selection, and told him he wanted the player replaced in the squad. Unsurprisingly, the player backed down and signed.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after midnight, a 25-year-old woman {{suffered}} a fractured bone after being {{shot in the}} leg by a live round fired from New Barnsley RUC base. The base {{was the target of}} a gun and grenade attack. At the Larnak Way interface in West Belfast, loyalists tried to enter the nationalist area at 3am. A shot fired from the nationalist side struck a 14-year-old Protestant boy who was climbing over the security fence. It hit him in the shoulder and punctured a lung. One source reported that warning shots had been fired, while <b>another</b> <b>said</b> the teenager was wounded when an IRA unit launched a gun and grenade attack on a military base near the interface. Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) gunmen also opened fire on British soldiers in the Ardoyne area of North Belfast.|$|E
25|$|On 19 August 2012, at {{approximately}} 12:30pm. PDT, Scott died by suicide by jumping off the Vincent Thomas Bridge in the San Pedro port district of Los Angeles. Investigators from the Los Angeles Police Department's Harbor Division found contact {{information in a}} note left in his car, parked on the bridge, and a note at his office for his family. One witness {{said he did not}} hesitate before jumping, but <b>another</b> <b>said</b> he looked nervous before climbing a fence, hesitating for two seconds, and jumping into the water beside a tour boat. His body was recovered from the water by the Los Angeles Port Police. On 22 August, Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Ed Winters said the two notes Scott left behind made no mention of any health problems, but neither the police nor the family disclosed the content of those notes.|$|E
25|$|Three Israeli commandos were {{captured}}. The first captured soldier, {{the commanding}} officer of the assault team, was abseiling from the helicopter when he was attacked by ten men before his feet hit the deck. He was beaten across his body and head, then picked up and thrown to the lower deck, where he was attacked by a dozen activists. They beat and choked him, removed his bulletproof vest and sidearm and smashed his helmet, and shoved him into a passenger hall below deck. The second soldier {{was surrounded by a}} team of fifteen to twenty activists in two groups. One group attacked him when he landed on the ship's roof. He fired one shot at an activist holding a knife before being subdued. The activists seized his gun and beat him as he attempted to fight them off {{with his back to the}} hull. He was picked up by his arms and legs, and thrown over the hull. He attempted to hang onto the hull with both hands, but was forced to let go when activists beat his hands and pulled him down by his legs. He was then surrounded by another group of activists, stabbed in the stomach and dragged into a lounge while being beaten. A third soldier who was lowered onto the deck saw an activist waiting to attack him with an iron crowbar. After shoving him away, he was attacked by four more activists, one of whom wrapped a chain around his neck and choked him until he lost consciousness. He was then thrown onto the bridge deck, where he was attacked by about twenty activists, who beat him, cut away his equipment, and dragged him into the lounge. The three soldiers were severely wounded and bleeding heavily. Two of the soldiers had their hands tied, and a third was unconscious and went into convulsions. During their captivity, they were subjected to physical and verbal abuse, and photographed and filmed. One of the soldiers said that he was beaten after he began moving and yelling that one of the soldiers needed a doctor, and <b>another</b> <b>said</b> that he was placed onto a couch, beaten, and threatened that he would be beaten every time he moved. Although radical activists attempted to harm them further, more moderate passengers intervened and protected the soldiers. Two were given water and one with a severe stomach wound was given a gauze pad. Hasan Huseyin Uysal, a Turkish doctor, cleaned the blood off their faces and tended to facial cuts.|$|E

500|$|Cosby {{returned}} as Coca-Cola's spokesperson in its 1982 [...] "Coke Is It" [...] campaign, {{a series of}} commercials mocking the Pepsi Challenge. One advertisement in this series showed a Pepsi vending machine to mock the brand, which author Mark Pendergrast called [...] "unthinkable". <b>Another</b> <b>said</b> Pepsi Challenge commercials were misleading because they never showed anyone choosing Coke. John Bergin, who directed the series of commercials, personally disliked Cosby but said his presence in Coca-Cola advertising ended the first Pepsi Challenge campaign in 1983.|$|E

500|$|The game's difficulty, {{especially}} {{the complexity of}} the VS System ruleset, was described as a potential barrier for gamers. [...] PALGN said [...] "Even though there are a handful of in-game tutorials, they aren’t entirely utilised efficiently as they’re basically just a big slab of text making the game less friendly towards a wider audience." [...] GamesRadar's Eric Bratcher said [...] "If you aren't familiar with the source, get ready for a very steep learning curve." [...] One X-Play reviewer commented that the game's tutorial [...] "might {{go down in history as}} the worst in-game tutorial ever created," [...] and <b>another</b> <b>said</b> that gamers who would be most interested in the video game would already be avid players of the physical version.|$|E
500|$|Though {{one critic}} {{said that the}} episode was [...] "the first straight-up comedic episode of the second series", <b>another</b> <b>said</b> that the episode's humour was {{balanced}} with tragedy and poignancy, arguing that the whole episode has an element of horror. This was especially true given that the story reflects actual happenings; the depiction of torture was described as [...] "genuinely upsetting". Despite the sole setting of the barn, the episode evokes a degree of folk horror. [...] "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" [...] was described by Jonathan Wright (The Guardian) and Phoebe Jane-Boyd (Den of Geek) as like a Hammer Horror film with added humour, and writers for the Irish Examiner said that the episode should appeal to both horror and comedy fans.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{had been}} {{suggested}} that Pauline's presence in EastEnders was largely peripheral for some time, the news of her departure in 2006 was met with dismay by fans and soap journalists alike.

She's such a large character", and <b>another</b> <b>said</b> [...] "If she goes then I think EastEnders is finished." [...] BBC controller of continuing drama, John Yorke, commented Richard [...] "occupies a huge place in people's hearts", and executive producer Kate Harwood said, [...] "For many years Wendy simply was EastEnders for the audience and Pauline's indomitable nature typified the grit and fight that embodies the EastEnders spirit...

500|$|The poem, {{named after}} the [...] "Last Post" [...] (the bugle call used at British ceremonies remembering those killed in war), makes {{explicit}} references to Wilfred Owen's poem from the First World War Dulce et Decorum Est. It imagines {{what would happen if}} time ran backwards and those killed in the war came back to life; their lives would still be full of possibilities and filled with [...] "love, work, children, talent, English beer, good food." [...] The poem was generally well received, with one commentator saying that it was [...] "simply a damn good poem with rich imagery, cinematic movement and poignant ending." [...] <b>Another</b> <b>said</b> that it was [...] "moving reversal of history" [...] and a [...] "fine poem". Duffy herself was quoted as saying that she wanted to honour the tradition of poets who were soldiers.|$|E
500|$|Later in 1994, Lundgren {{appeared}} in Perry Lang's Men of War (scripted by John Sayles) alongside Charlotte Lewis and B. D. Wong as Nick Gunar, a former Special Ops soldier who leads {{a group of}} mercenaries to a treasure island in the South China Sea. The film was mainly shot in Thailand, with Krabi and Phong Nga making {{up most of the}} island scenery. The film was well received by some critics. One author said [...] "Men of War invokes the most vividly remembered fighting in a foreign land of recent Western history. This innovation, associating the muscle image with the Vietnam experience, is carried over into other contemporary muscle films." [...] <b>Another</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "fine performances by an all-star Dolph Lundgren as a mercenary assigned to [...] "convince" [...] a cast in this offbeat and disturbing film." ...|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews, however, were negative.

[...] An Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) reviewer stated it has [...] "cooler character designs on a PS2 fighter" [...] whilst <b>another</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "some of the coolest 2D game artwork ever." [...] Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine deemed it as [...] "the best-looking 2D graphics ever seen in a fighter." [...] 1UP.com said, [...] "the ultrasharp, hi-res character art and fluid animation keep XX at the cutting 2D edge." [...] Dunham, Knutson, Keil, and GamePro commended its similarity with Japanese animated series. The reviewer for GamePro stated it [...] "becomes an art form in its own right." [...] Greg Kasavin of GameSpot, however, said [...] "many of the moves in the game are animated so strangely {{that it can be}} difficult to see exactly what's going on." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{quality of}} the {{animation}} received a mixed reception. The {{quality of the}} animation in early episodes was lauded Clover Harker of the UK Anime Network, who said it was, [...] "impressive". Kevin Cirugeda of Anime News Network commented that character designer Tadashi Hiramatsu was able to, [...] "make it feel fresh, but also weirdly reminiscent of the past", comparing the series to FLCL. In later episodes however, there was criticism of the animation skating routines, with one describing it as, [...] "at times painful, or perhaps embarrassing to watch", while <b>another</b> <b>said</b> that the poor animation was the fault of Yamamoto's over-ambition. The music gained positive comment, especially the opening theme tune to the series, [...] "History Maker". Ian Wolf of Anime UK News commented on its rousing theme; the use of English connecting to the show's international feel; {{and the use of}} both unusual musical instruments such a xylophone in the introduction and of a [...] time signature, arguably make the song a fast waltz and thus a dance akin to ballet.|$|E
500|$|Witnesses {{also said}} they heard two {{explosive}} noises, the first as the aircraft [...] "crossed the airport boundary and the second when the aircraft was about halfway between the airport and the crash site."

The aircraft impacted with the roof of a three-storey apartment building before it crashed into a wooded ravine approximately 250 feet from busy Buford Highway, a major Atlanta road lined with apartments. All five passengers and two crew members were killed in the accident, and an individual on the ground, standing in a parking lot, sustained serious burns from aviation fuel and remained in a critical condition for a day after the accident. The apartment building was damaged, and several parked vehicles destroyed.|$|E
