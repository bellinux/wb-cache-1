25|$|While often {{attributed}} to the Johnny Hart comic strip B.C., the original <b>anteater</b> design {{was based on the}} Playboy bunny. In November 1965, the UCI students officially voted on the <b>anteater.</b> In a special follow-up election, students opted for a mascot based on the B.C. <b>anteater</b> over the Playboy version.|$|E
25|$|The white-headed {{capuchin}} is {{native to}} the forests of the province, as is the mantled howler. Other mammals native to Alajuela include Baird's tapir, the giant <b>anteater,</b> the silky <b>anteater,</b> margays, ocelots, and other wild cats.

25|$|The <b>anteater</b> {{was chosen}} in 1965 when {{students}} {{were allowed to}} submit mascot candidates, which would be voted on in a campus election. Three undergraduates named Pat Glasgow, Bob Ernst, and Schuyler Hadley Basset III were credited with choosing the <b>anteater</b> and designing a cartoon representation, having been disappointed with other candidates such as a roadrunner, unicorn, seahawk and golden bison.|$|E

50|$|This {{animal is}} an insectivore, feeding mostly on ants or termites. In areas that {{experience}} seasonal flooding, like the grassy plains of the Venezuelan llanos, <b>anteaters</b> mainly feed on ants, because termites are less available. Conversely, <b>anteaters</b> at Emas National Park eat mainly termites, which occur in high density on the grasslands. At Serra da Canastra, <b>anteaters</b> switch between eating mainly ants during the wet season (October to March) and termites {{during the dry}} season (May to September).|$|R

25|$|Despite {{the similar}} dietary habits {{and methods of}} {{consumption}} to those of an <b>anteater,</b> {{there is no evidence}} supporting the idea that echidna-like monotremes have been myrmecophagic (ant or termite-eating) since the Cretaceous.

25|$|During 1962 and 1963 {{a mysterious}} skin ailment afflicted the polar bears {{and would not}} respond to treatment.

Natasha {{was the mother of}} the only cub to survive to {{adulthood}} in the seventy years Auckland Zoo exhibited polar bears. His name was Chimo and he was born in the early sixties. This period also saw the arrival of many new animals, including a pregnant zebra, a female giraffe Anita, a pair of Bengal tigers, two young polar bears, a giant <b>anteater,</b> two capuchin monkeys, and four spider monkeys. The giraffe herd and spider monkey troop at the zoo today are descended from these imports.|$|E
40|$|The type of {{learning}} exhibited during foraging {{has been studied}} in {{a large number of}} species. Species that feed on food sources that temporally vary in quality could be well suited for exhibiting evidence of spatial learning. The foraging strategies of captive giant <b>anteaters</b> were examined using an experimental foraging task. Two giant <b>anteaters</b> were exposed to a modified radial arm maze in order {{to determine whether or not}} they would demonstrate evidence of spatial learning. Both subjects demonstrated significant improvement in performance by visiting baited feeders more consistently across learning trials. A disruption in performance occurred when the task was reversed, indicating that giant <b>anteaters</b> may use spatial learning to locate food sources. Obtaining a more sound understanding of the cognitive abilities of giant <b>anteaters</b> may help to enhance their welfare in captive settings...|$|R
40|$|Giant <b>anteaters</b> (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) are {{specialized}} insectivores {{and consume}} mainly ants and termites in the wild. In captivity, giant <b>anteaters</b> are either fed a complete diet, {{or a combination}} of a domestic carnivore diet with leaf eater pellets, or a traditional gruel-type diet. Soft faeces are a frequently encountered problem with this type of feeding. In the present study, we analysed diet and faeces composition, calculated digestibility and measured mean retention time on various diets in eight giant <b>anteaters</b> (total of n = 64 experiments). The results suggest that the digestive physiology of giant <b>anteaters</b> {{is similar to that of}} domestic dogs and cats in terms of nutrient digestibility and digesta retention. When testing correlations between faecal dry matter content and other variables, no relationship with dietary crude fibre content or mean digesta retention time could be detected. However, acid insoluble ash intake was significantly and positively correlated with faecal dry matter content. The amount of acid insoluble ash excreted with the faeces was higher than that ingested with the diet offered, indicating that the giant <b>anteaters</b> ingested soil from their enclosure of up to 93 g per day. This finding is consistent with observation of faeces of wild giant <b>anteaters</b> that contain soil or sand most likely due to indiscriminate feeding. It also corresponds to reports that indigestible materials such as peat, soil, chitin or cellulose contribute to a firmer faecal consistency in various carnivore species. Therefore, offering giant <b>anteaters</b> the opportunity to voluntarily ingest soil from their enclosure might be beneficial...|$|R
