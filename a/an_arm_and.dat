5|$|Fleming's second novel, Live and Let Die {{shows that}} in his early twenties, Leiter wrote a few pieces on Dixieland jazz for the New York Amsterdam News. Bond scholar John Griswold notes that in the {{original}} draft of the story, Fleming killed Leiter off in the shark attack; when Naomi Burton, Fleming's US agent with Curtis Brown, protested {{about the death of}} the character, Fleming relented and Leiter lived, albeit missing <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> half a leg. Espionage scholar Rupert Allason, writing as Nigel West, noted that Leiter's involvement in a domestic US matter was a breach of the CIA's charter, as laid out in the National Security Act of 1947.|$|E
5|$|The carnival's backstory {{begins at}} the end of the nineteenth century when Lucius Belyakov, a Russian aristocrat from Minsk and officer in the Tsar's army, became aware of his Avataric powers. The birth of his son Alexei evoked dark visions in him. After Belyakov's attempt to kill two-year-old Alexei, his wife fled with their two {{children}} to America, but news spread they perished in a train accident soon thereafter. Resuming his duties in Lemberg in 1914, Belyakov was again afflicted by dark visions. Henry Scudder, an American who had escaped prosecution for criminal activities in his home country by joining foreign armies, had had psychokinetic powers since childhood. At the time of Belyakov's visions, Scudder was stationed in Lemberg as an observer for the Austro-Hungarian Army. Belyakov became obsessed with killing his spiritual enemy (Scudder) and deserted his post, but an escaped circus bear feeding on the dead nearby surprised him in an attack. Belyakov was so gravely injured he would lose <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> both legs.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, {{during the}} bishopric of Richard Joseph Fitzgerald, {{extensive}} {{developments in the}} Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned were accomplished. Bishop Fitzgerald decided to replace the statue of Our Lady of Europe {{in order to make}} the two side-altars symmetrical. As the right altar had an upright statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a similar statue was desired for the left one (where the old statue of Our Lady of Europe was placed). The new statue was manufactured in France, and put in the altar where the old statue stood, but the faithful never held it in the same esteem as the old one, which was stored away. In 1965, Charles Caruana (later Bishop of Gibraltar, then the priest responsible of the Cathedral's sacristy) rediscovered the lost statue in a store. It was however, damaged due to humidity and <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> hand had become detached. After restoration, the statue was placed in the Cathedral sacristy. It was Bishop Bernard Devlin who in 1986 reinstalled the statue in its original location, where it remains to this day.|$|E

While Bond and Leiter are scouting one of Mr Big's warehouses used for storing exotic fish, Solitaire is kidnapped by Mr Big's minions.

Bond finds him in their safe house with a note pinned to his chest [...] "He disagreed with something that ate him". Bond then investigates the warehouse himself and discovers that Mr Big is smuggling gold [...] coins by hiding them {{in the bottom of}} fish tanks holding poisonous tropical fish, which he is bringing into the US. He is attacked in the warehouse by [...] "the Robber", Mr Big's gunman, and in the resultant gunfight Bond outwits the Robber and causes him to fall into the shark tank.|$|E

500|$|While {{the editor}} of Personal Computer World was on holiday in May 1981, his colleagues publicised the magazine's review of the ZX81 with a cover showing a {{chimpanzee}} with the machine above the strapline [...] "Editor benchtests the ZX81". (The chimp returned in later issues to [...] "benchtest" [...] all of Sinclair's subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented [...] "absolutely amazing value for money". He described the ZX81 as [...] "a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting {{to find out more}} about computers, but without it costing them <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> a leg" [...] and concluded: [...] "If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that.

500|$|Fleming {{builds the}} main {{character}} in Live and Let Die to make Bond come across as more human than in Casino Royale, becoming [...] "a much warmer, more likeable man from the opening chapter", according to the American novelist Raymond Benson, who between 1997 and 2002 wrote a series of Bond novels and short stories. Savoye sees {{the introduction of a}} vulnerable side to Bond, identifying the agent's tears {{towards the end of the}} story as evidence of this. Similarly, over the course of the book, the American character Leiter develops and also emerges as a more complete and human character and his and Bond's friendship is evident in the story. Despite the relationship, Leiter is again subordinate to Bond. While in Casino Royale his role was to provide technical support and money to Bond, in Live and Let Die the character is secondary to Bond, and the only time he takes the initiative, he loses <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> a leg, while Bond wins his own battle with the same opponent. Although Fleming had initially intended to kill Leiter off in the story, his American literary agent protested, and the character was saved.|$|E
500|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{or unusual}} body features {{are not uncommon}} among Carnivàle actors. Michael J. Anderson (Samson) has osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic bone disorder that leaves him at a size of 3ft7 (109cm), while Matthew McGrory (Giant) stood at 7ft6 (228cm) because of hyperpituitarism. Bree Walker (Sabina) has ectrodactyly, a rare genetic disorder that results in fused fingers and toes; she approached the producers in the second season to let her play a [...] "lobster gal". Several actors for one-time characters like the lobster gal in [...] "Hot and Bothered" [...] and Percy The Praying Mantis in [...] "The Road to Damascus" [...] were also cast for their respective real-life disabilities. Cameron Clapp (Management) had lost <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> both legs in a train accident {{at the age of}} 15. Daniel Browning Smith (Rollo the Rubberboy) holds two Guinness World Records for his body-bending abilities. The actors playing the roles of the conjoined twins (Karyne and Sarah Steben, identical twins and real-life trapezists), Lila the Bearded Lady (Debra Christofferson) and Gecko the Lizard Man (John Fleck) are performers without genetic aberrances whose appearances were altered through makeup and prosthetics.|$|E

500|$|During the 1925 Winter Carnival Tournament, Nelsen, {{sick with}} influenza, set {{a world record}} at the Big Hill. Jumping 73meters (240ft), the record {{remained}} until it was broken by Adolph Badrut at Bernina-Roseg-Schanze in Switzerland in 1930, who jumped [...] However, Bob Lymburne was able to again claim the world record for the Big Hill, when he jumped [...] in 1932. Although accepted as a record, it {{was not at the}} time favored in Europe to stress distance records. This was because it was regarded that simply building a larger hill would undoubtedly give a longer jump, and in part because such records did not take style into consideration. Nelsen and Melbourne McKenzie planned to travel to St. Moritz, Switzerland, to attend the 1928 Winter Olympics, but lack of funding meant that they planned for work for their fare on a freighter. These plans were stopped by officials from the British delegation, who felt it was inappropriate and not fitting for the team, and Nelsen never competed in any Winter Olympics. Nelsen kept his amateur status, but did well against professionals those times he competed against them. During the winter of 1932, he worked as a ski instructor in Quebec. In a hunting accident in 1932, he lost <b>an</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> never jumped again.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, Hubbard was still {{developing}} Scientology's doctrines. A Scientology biography states that [...] "free of organizational duties and {{aided by the}} first Sea Org members, L. Ron Hubbard now had the time and facilities to confirm in the physical universe some of the events and places he had encountered in his journeys down the track of time." [...] In 1965, he designated several existing Scientology courses as confidential, repackaging them as {{the first of the}} esoteric [...] "OT levels". Two years later he announced the release of OT3, the [...] "Wall of Fire", revealing the secrets of an immense disaster that had occurred [...] "on this planet, and on the other seventy-five planets which form this Confederacy, seventy-five million years ago". Scientologists were required to undertake the first two OT levels before learning how Xenu, the leader of the Galactic Confederacy, had shipped billions of people to Earth and blown them up with hydrogen bombs, following which their traumatized spirits were stuck together at [...] "implant stations", brainwashed with false memories and eventually became contained within human beings. The discovery of OT3 was said to have taken a major physical toll on Hubbard, who announced that he had broken a knee, <b>an</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> his back during the course of his research. A year later, in 1968, he unveiled OT levels 4 to 6 and began delivering OT training courses to Scientologists aboard the Royal Scotman.|$|E
