40|$|In this thesis, 10 -day sediment-based static {{bioassay}} {{tests on}} the amphipod Corophium volutator (Pallas, termed C. volutator) were initially designed and set up, in order to investigate mobility, bioaccumulation and toxicity of the metals {{with an emphasis on}} <b>arsenic</b> in <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphides</b> (AsS, As 2 S 3, and Fe[AsS]) and coal-mining spoils (from Kirkcaldy, Scotland and Huainan, China). The marine amphipod is sensitive to metals (As, Cd, Pb, and Ba), which were generally recognised as the most important metals in the drainage water of coal-mining spoils. C. volutator, under the designed test, could indicate the release of contaminants derived from the <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphides</b> and the spoils for environmental implications, and is of potential applicability in characterising the sulphide-bearing spoils in terms of toxicology monitoring. Toxicity and arsenic bioaccumulation in C. volutator varied greatly between different exposure minerals, in decreasing order: AsS≥As 2 S 3 >>Fe[AsS], in association with the 10 -day LD 50 (referring to mineral-spiked ratio in test sediment) of 0. 032 - 0. 073 %, 0. 050 - 0. 097 %, and 0. 245 - 0. 289 %, respectively and 10 -day LC 50 value (referring to test media) of 0. 42 - 0. 95 mg As L - 1 to the bio-indicator. It was found that there is an inverse logarithmic correlation between BAFs and arsenic concentrations in the media. The presence of predominantly arsenite (As III) in the mineral leachates and bioaccumulation of inorganic arsenic (As III and As V) associated with eliminated biomethylation (to DMA V) in exposed organism have a close linkage to the relatively lower LC 50 values during 10 -day exposure duration. This infers that the arsenic-sulphur complex in the exposure media may plays a key role for mineral release and biological-effect of toxic arsenic.

40|$|A general {{re-examination}} of {{the artificial}} <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphide</b> pigments orpiment, realgar and alacranite using polarised light microscopy (PLM), {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) combined with energy and wavelength dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX, WDX) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) revealed the following results: wet-process precipitation products of artificial orpiment consist of golden yellow, amorphous, spherical particles ranging from 0. 2 to 2 μm Ø. Dry-process roasting and/or sublimation products with an arsenolite/sulphur mixture consist mainly of amorphous golden yellow oval drops and spherules of amorphous <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphide</b> glass (g-AsxSx) with a smooth surface ranging from 1 to 20 μm Ø in association with arsenolite crystal aggregates {{and members of the}} alacranite solid solution series (As 8 S 8) –(As 8 S 9). A bright lemon yellow to orange-red <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphide</b> pigment on a sixteenth/seventeenth-century South German polychrome recumbent sculpture and a seventeenth-century Dutch painting attributed to Rembrandt's studio has been identified as an artificial orpiment produced with dry-process (roasting/sublimation) methods. The recumbent figure contains (i) yellow, orange or red-brown amorphous splintery fragments and spherules of <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphide</b> glass of up to 25 μm Ø, (ii) yellow, brown or red-brown crystalline spherules and splintery fragments of alacranite, (iii) lemon yellow to red-brown agglomerates of <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphide</b> glass, and (iv) colourless irregular fragments or octahedral crystals of arsenolite. This type can be classified as 'complex artificial orpiment'. The <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphide</b> pigment in the yellowish paint layers of the Rembrandt studio painting proved to be very uniform bright yellow spherules (max. 9 μm Ø) of <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphide</b> glass, which can be classified as 'purified artificial orpiment glass'.

As 8 S 9) in the form of spherules, which fill gas bubbles and pores with an average 3 μm Ø (max. 20 μm Ø). A very fine-grained light red <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphide</b> powder called 'Realgar' from an archaeological excavation of a historic arsenic smelter near Strassegg (Steiermark, Austria) turned out to be a member of the alacranite solid solution series (As 8 S 8) –(As 8 S 9) in the form of idiomorphic crystals and complex twinned crystal aggregates (average 10 μm Ø, max. 30 μm Ø). All red-colored crystals or crystal aggregates of artificial arsenic sulphides that have been called 'realgar' in the past are in fact members of the alacranite solid solution series.

40|$|In {{a museum}} all objects are {{subjected}} to decay caused by many contributing factors: temperature, humidity, pollutants. Among these environmental risks, light remains unique because it can neither be eliminated nor completely controlled. Light is necessary for viewing a work of art, but, as it involves the transmission of energy, it can damage the artwork. Nowadays, the most common methods for controlling light {{are based on the}} spectrum of the sources and on the control of the overall lighting intensity. In particular, museum lighting guidelines recommend to limit the time of illumination or to remove wavelengths of light to which human eyes are insensitive. The most important parameters are illuminance and time of exposure. According to CIE 157 : 2004, cultural heritage objects are classified according to their sensibility to light exposure in no sensibility, low sensibility, medium sensibility and high sensibility, but no guidelines directly consider the photo-chemical interaction between artwork and light. This survey aims at determining how lighting systems can be standardized and developed, by studying the interaction between light and the materials constituting cultural property. To develop this research, an interesting case-study was considered as starting point: the <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphides</b> photo-oxidation induced by visible light. In particular, among <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphides,</b> realgar photo-degradation was studied, as this pigment was used since antiquity. Light transforms realgar (red mineral, As 4 S 4) in arsenolite (white if powered, As 2 O 3) and pararealgar (yellow, As 4 S 4), a compound with the same formula of realgar but characterized by a different disposition of sulphur and arsenic atoms. The process isn't still completely clarified. This study deepens realgar degradation and determines the capacity of inducing degradation by different halogen lamps and a LED lamp, used in museum exhibitions. The survey was carried out by means of FT-IR, micro-RAMAN spectroscopy, SEM/EDX, XRD, XPS and spectra colorimeter analysis. Because vision is generated by the brain interactions with energy and matter, the capacity of eyes to evidence the realgar transformation has been studied. This aspect allows to know the best lighting source in terms of lighting reproduction and quality. The results partly confirm literature studies about the realgar degradation induced by light, but also suggest that some mechanisms are still not completely clarified. The LED lamp produces a less degradation, keeping a high quality of lighting. KrensEnergia Sr...|$|R

30|$|Geologically, {{orpiment}} (As 2 S 3) and realgar (As 4 S 4) occur together, and {{are often}} associated with antimonates and other sulphides [1, 30]. Orpiment and realgar were highly appreciated especially in Egypt and China for their rich yellow and red–orange shades [1, 170 – 174], even though the pigments were considered “unpleasant” by many artists, and not recommended to use in combination with copper and lead based pigments, such as verdigris and leadwhite [1, 30, 170]. Orpiment and realgar exist as minerals, as well as synthetic pigments [175], and of the two <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphide</b> pigments, {{the first one is}} the most stable. Realgar, being unstable, was less often reported in works of art [1, 176 – 179]. It has a polymorphic photodegradation product, pararealgar As 4 S 4. Permanence of <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphide</b> pigments is problematic, especially on exposure to the green region of the visible spectrum [174, 180]. Moreover, smaller particles are more readily degraded [174]. The sensitivity to green light has {{to be taken into account}} when lasers need to be used, such as during Raman spectroscopic analysis [177, 181, 182]. Arsenates (As 5 +) are formed from orpiment, realgar and emerald green degradation: these ions are water soluble and migrate throughout the whole painting, accumulating at interfaces between layers, around Fe/Mn rich particles, and according to the local pH conditions in the paint layer. Due to this water-based transport, appropriate cleaning solvents must be selected, and relative humidity controlled [180, 183]. It seems that polysaccharidic media, or egg yolk, negatively affect the stability of the <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphide</b> pigments [184].|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} analyse {{differences}} in concentration, speciation and total mobility of arsenic two different locations were studied near the Helgoland Mud Area, North Sea. The first location is characterised by natural sedimentation, the second by deposited sediments dredged {{from the port}} of Hamburg. Porewater as well as sediment profiles were analysed with respect to arsenic compounds (As (III) and total As) and major redox species as total and reactive manganese and iron. The sediment samples were handled under inert atmosphere before and during extraction by water, phosphate, hydrochloric acid and aqua regia. Total element contents in porewater and leachable extracts of sediment fractions were analysed. The results show a strong redox coupling of arsenic with manganese and iron. Oxidized arsenic seems to adsorb to manganese- and iron-oxyhydroxides in surface sediments. In contrast to the solid samples, the pore water data shows a release of As (III) into porewater when manganese- and ironoxyhydroxides are reduced in {{the upper part of}} the cores. Also a remobilisation of As (V) occurs. Downward diffusing arsenic can be fixed by carbonate below the zone of manganese and iron reduction. In the anoxic parts of the sediments As (III) and As (V) are released and could be fixed at authigenic iron <b>sulphide</b> or <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphides</b> formation. A sulfidic precipitation of arsenic in iron-dominated systems is limited by the occurrence of HS-. Total solid-phase contents in leachable extracts of sediment fractions of the natural area show significant higher arsenic concentrations than the core of the anthropogenic dumping area. This is due to the higher fines content of the Helgoland mud area. Higher total porewater contents of iron and arsenic in the core of the anthropogenic dumping area thus due to higher turnover rates of organic matter by iron reduction. Higher concentrations of arsenic may be due to a higher availability of iron in the dumped sediments...|$|R

30|$|Red lead, or minium, has a {{long history}} of use in {{worldwide}} artistic and artisanal practices, although nomenclature issues are evident [1, 237, 238]. Its synthesis and relation with the other lead oxides is well described in literature [238]. As a pigment, it is not stable in fresco, or in watercolour. It was anyway used, for its optical properties and cheap price, compared to other red pigments [1, 120]. It is reportedly blackened on manuscripts and in glue tempera paintings exposed to light and humidity [1, 64]. On the other hand, it is reported that medium-rich proteinaceous red lead paints are stable to light, the binder protecting the pigment [239]. Moreover, the pigmented layer has different properties than an unpigmented one [51]. It is soluble in diluted acids (nitric, chloridric, oxalic, acetic), with formation of the corresponding salts, and when heated it transforms to litharge [1, 240]. It is sensitive to sulphur containing compounds, as H 2 S and SO 2 of atmospheric or biological origin, and pigments such as <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphides</b> (AsxSy), vermillion (HgS) and ultramarine (Na 8 [Al 6 Si 6 O 24]Sn), especially in manuscripts, wall paintings, and in case the pigment is not mixed with a binder, which cause the formation of dark grey PbS [1, 60, 93, 124, 238, 241] and of whitish PbSO 4 [59, 68, 233, 242]. This was known to artists and artisans, as demonstrated by the presence of a blank space between yellow orpiment and red lead in a 12 th century illuminated manuscript, although mixtures of the two pigments do not behave consistently. The reaction between red lead and orpiment produced galena, which could further degrade into sulphates, and lead arsenate species [241]. Mimetite Pb 5 (AsO 4) 3 Cl was as well identified as a reaction product of minium and orpiment [186]. Moreover, it seems that minium promotes the blackening of leadwhite, when the pigments are mixed [204]. Some cases of red lead lightening are reported as well, and are related to the formation of lead sulphates and/or carbonates, according to the atmospheric pollutants and to the initial amount of PbO in red lead [68, 93, 200, 237, 238], via the formation of plumbonacrite [228].|$|R

The observed mineralization occurs as metal-rich coatings around quartz and other primary grains and as a replacement in areas where calcite has dissolved. Examples of other metal sulphides and other associated mineralization are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{process for}} the {{precipitation}} of trivalent <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphide</b> in sulphate-reducing condition at low pH would be very attractive due to the high arsenic content (60 %) in the final precipitate. A bacterial consortium able to reduce sulphate at pH 4. 5 served to inoculate column bioreactors that were continuously fed with As(V) or As(III), glycerol and/or hydrogen, at pH values between 2 and 5. The diversity, functionality and evolution of the consortium colonizing the bioreactors were characterized by means of biomolecular tools, in relation with operating parameters (pH, As, sulphide, acetate). The highest As removal rate obtained during these experiments was close to 3 mg. l- 1. h- 1 using As(V) as the initial arsenic form, while precipitation rates were improved using As(III). When glycerol was replaced by hydrogen in a bioreactor containing a mature biofilm, sulphate-reducing activity increased roughly. Organisms related to Desulfosporosinus were the only sulphate-reducing bacterium (SRB) detected in the bioreactor. arrA genes, involved in As(V) dissimilatory reduction, were also detected and suggested that As(V) was reduced by a Desulfosporosinus-like organism. Molecular fingerprints evidenced an evolution of the bacterial population structure according to changes in operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|Arsenic (As) is a {{chemical}} element that is naturally found in trace amounts in our environment so, {{in addition to}} being referred to as a metalloid, it is a trace element. It is the 20 th most abundant element in rocks (1 - 2 mg/kg) and, due to its reputation as the Victorian’s poison of choice, awareness of the harmful aspects of this element to human health is high. It occurs in many geological materials with the highest concentrations found in <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphide</b> minerals such as arsenopyrite (FeAsS), as well as an accessory element in other sulphides such as iron pyrites (FeS 2). A significant source of As released into the surface environment is as a result of oxidation of sulphide minerals. Phosphate-rich rocks, ironstones and coal-bearing strata can also contain high levels of As. Overall, As minerals and compounds are generally soluble but the mobility of As can be limited by strong sorption by clays, hydroxides and organic matter. Under normal oxidising conditions {{the most common form of}} As in solution is the arsenate oxyanion (containing As 5 +), under more reducing conditions (e. g. waterlogging) the arsenite oxyanion (containing As 3 +) is more stable...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} and measure any relations between occupational exposure to cadmium compounds (oxide, sulphide, and sulphate) {{and the risk}} of mortality from lung cancer. METHODS: The mortality experience of 571 male production workers from a cadmium recovery facility in the United States was investigated for the period 1940 - 82. All study subjects were first employed in the period 1926 - 69; they had all been employed for at least six months between 1 January 1940 and 31 December 1969. Newly abstracted detailed job histories for the period 1926 - 76 were combined with assessments of exposures to cadmium over time to develop individual estimates of cumulative exposure to cadmium (total exposure and exposures received both in the presence and absence of "high" exposures to arsenic trioxide). Poisson regression was used to investigate risks of mortality from lung cancer in relation to four concentrations of cumulative exposure to cadmium (2000 mg. m- 3. days). RESULTS: After adjustment for age attained, year of hire, and Hispanic ethnicity, there was a significant positive trend (P < 0. 05) between cumulative exposure to cadmium and risks of mortality from lung cancer. Relative to a risk of unity for the lowest exposure category (first level), risks were 2. 30 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 72 to 7. 36), 2. 83 (95 % CI 0. 75 to 10. 72), and 3. 88 (95 % CI 1. 04 to 14. 46) for the second, third, and fourth categories, respectively. Similar findings were obtained after adjustment for age only. Trends were more pronounced when employment histories were lagged first by 10 years and then by 20 years. A separate analysis examined the independent effects of exposure to cadmium received in the presence of high exposures to arsenic trioxide (mainly cadmium oxide) and exposures to cadmium received without such exposure to <b>arsenic</b> (mainly cadmium <b>sulphide</b> and cadmium sulphate). A significant trend for a risk of lung cancer was found only for exposures to cadmium received in the presence of arsenic trioxide. CONCLUSIONS: Hypotheses which are consistent with the study findings include: (a) cadmium oxide in the presence of arsenic trioxide is a human lung carcinogen, (b) cadmium oxide and arsenic trioxide are human lung carcinogens and cadmium sulphate and cadmium sulphide are not (or they are less potent carcinogens), or (c) arsenic trioxide is a human lung carcinogen and cadmium oxide, cadmium sulphate, and cadmium sulphide are not. There were only 21 deaths from lung cancer available for this analysis and it is impossible to gauge which, if any, of these hypotheses are correct...|$|R
30|$|Electron {{interaction}} with its antiparticle (positron) in lifetime measuring mode {{is known as}} an effective probing tool to characterize nanostructurization in solids possessing mixed trapping channels for annihilating positrons and their bound electron-positron states, i.e. positronium (Ps) atoms [1 – 5]. Intrinsic inhomogeneities due to guest nanoparticles (NP) of the same chemistry and size embedded in a structurally homogeneous host matrix (NP-uniform composite systems) can be adequately {{described in terms of}} substitution trapping in positron- and Ps-related sites, allowing estimation of interfacial voids or triple junctions (TJ) between contacting NP as free-volume elements (FVE) responsible for positron trapping and defect-free bulk lifetimes of nanostructurized matrix [6, 7]. Recently, this approach was proved for <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphide</b> As 4 S 4 NP capped with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as nonionic stabilizer to produce NP-uniform composite pharmaceuticals with pronounced anticancer activity [8]. Realistically, in many applications, the NP subsystem is modified with components of other nature to ensure additional functionality like fluorescent emission (ZnS, ZnSe, CdS, CdSe) and magnetically addressable drug delivery (Fe 3 O 4). [9, 10]. In case of two different NP components forming NP-biased composite system, we apparently deal with high diversity of positron-Ps trapping paths resulting in complicated parameterization of responsible FVE.|$|E
3000|$|Yellow Pigments Yellow Ochre (Ram Raj), Raw Sienna, Orpiment and Litharge (Massicot) are {{classified}} in yellow pigments {{due to their}} yellow color range. The color of the yellow ochre is on {{the account of the}} presence of various hydrated forms of iron oxide, particularly the mineral limonite (Fe 2 O 3 ·H 2 O). The pigment is prepared from natural earth by selection, grinding, washing, and lavigation. Raw sienna belongs to Sienna (Siena earth) class of earth pigments containing iron oxide and manganese oxide. Along with ochre and umber it is first pigment to be used in human cave paintings. It is considerably transparent and used in paintings as a glaze for its transparency. Orpiment (Hartal in Hindi) is a deep orange-yellow colored <b>arsenic</b> <b>sulphide</b> mineral and gives a brilliant rich lemon-yellow color. Chemically, it is yellow sulphide of arsenic (As 2 S 3). Besides being used as a pigment, it has been used to tint paper to make it yellow. This process also imparts an insecticidal property to paper. Litharge (Massicot) is natural secondary mineral forms of lead oxide (galena) and is made by gently roasting white lead. White lead, which is chemically lead carbonate (2 PbCO 3 ·Pb(OH) 2), upon decarboxylation and dehydration gives on heating at a temperature of about 300  °C is converted into a pale yellow powder which is monoxide of lead (PbO).|$|E
