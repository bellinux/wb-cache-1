2500|$|In Wind, Whales and Whisky, Silver Donald Cameron {{discusses}} one of {{the ironies}} he sees about life in Cape Breton. On the one hand, the island seems poor with chronic unemployment, but on the other, its rural inhabitants have access to abundant and delicious food such as apples, cranberries, fish, deer, moose and the produce from their gardens. After describing [...] "the most unbelievably wonderful meal of the voyage"—lobster and grey sole baked in the oven with tinned mushroom soup accompanied by scalloped potatoes and broccoli, Cameron writes: [...] "I love living in a depressed region, I thought. One lives so well." [...] In a chapter entitled, Good People in Bad Times, Cameron outlines the troubles of industrial Cape Breton including the long decline of two of its economic mainstays, coal mining and steel making. [...] "It is a hard place to make a living," [...] he writes, [...] "but it is <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> live." ...|$|E

They support and embrace the department’s mission and are aligned with its goals and objectives. They also believe that their individual goals and objectives are appreciated and respected.

I understand that. They want to avoid regulations. They want to avoid paying a decent wage.

(which is not, properly speaking, in the garden, but faces it, straddling across the place by which you approach it from the town), an equestrian statue of that monarch set aloft in the middle of the terrace, and a very exalted and complicated fountain, which forms a background to the picture.

All this work dates from the middle of the last century.
