5000|$|Telephone Entertainment Line {{refers to}} a {{telephone}} number or numbers with (usually) an announce only answering machine, maintained {{for the purpose of}} providing entertainment over the telephone. These were most popular in Southern California in the 1960s and 1970s. Most lines played one short joke out of a pool that would rotate to a new joke each time the number was called, but others had a single long form (<b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute)</b> comedy that would change every week or so. Still others were [...] "comment lines" [...] that were like a talk show on the telephone. The comment lines would either have a separate number for callers to leave their opinions on, or a single number that would accept incoming recordings on a given day of the week.Examples included New York Telephone's Dial-a-JokeMany of these recordings have been archived on the Internet.|$|R

Several {{different}} riders in succession then posted successively (but, {{in the first}} few cases, marginally) better times than the best time that had come before them. Alessandro Bertolini, David Millar, Marco Pinotti, Giovanni Visconti, Bradley Wiggins, and Stefano Garzelli were all briefly the stage leader after they crossed the finish line. Bertolini in particular was stage leader for <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes,</b> as Millar started just behind him and barely beat his time.|$|E
5|$|At the {{breeding}} site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus {{takes place in}} the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is external. In many species such as the Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding them in place for <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes.</b> Members of the West African genus Nimbaphrynoides are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous; Limnonectes larvaepartus, Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the Tanzanian genus Nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous. In these species, fertilization is internal and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs, except L. larvaepartus, which give birth to tadpoles.|$|E

5|$|On August 6, 2015, police {{released}} a video {{from the night}} before the theft, that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape; one of them remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off. Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist.|$|E

25|$|Webern's {{compositions}} are concise, distilled, and select; just thirty-one of his compositions {{were published}} in his lifetime, and when Pierre Boulez later oversaw a project to record all of his compositions, including some of those without opus numbers, the results fit on just six CDs. Although Webern's music changed over time, {{as is often the}} case over a long career, it is typified by very spartan textures, in which every note can be clearly heard; carefully chosen timbres, often resulting in very detailed instructions to the performers and use of extended instrumental techniques (flutter tonguing, col legno, and so on); wide-ranging melodic lines, often with leaps greater than an octave; and brevity: the Six Bagatelles for string quartet (1913), for instance, last <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> in total.|$|E

50|$|Sermonettes were {{generally}} <b>about</b> <b>three</b> to five <b>minutes</b> in length, and featured religious clergy from {{churches in the}} local station's coverage area. Reflecting the majority religious faith in the U.S., the clergy involved were almost always Christian (Protestant or Roman Catholic), although in TV markets with a large Jewish population, a rabbi might occasionally be called upon.

40|$|Observations of {{hydroxyl}} (OH) emission from Comet Kohoutek {{were made}} during the evening of 24 January 1974, from an altitude of 41, 000 feet. The comet, of visual magnitude 5. 5 {{at the time of}} observation, was photographed with an f/ 1. 3 Maksutov slitless spectrograph of 150 -mm aperture. This spectrograph used a double quartz prism as the dispersion element to isolate the OH radiation in the low-resolution spectrum. A nearly spherical coma of OH <b>about</b> <b>three</b> arc <b>minutes</b> diameter, as observed from an earth-comet distance of 0. 88 AV, was photographed.

25|$|The {{playing time}} of a {{phonograph}} record depended on the turntable speed and the groove spacing. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, the early discs played for two minutes, the same as early cylinder records. The 12-inch disc, introduced by Victor in 1903, increased the playing time to three and a half minutes. Because a 10-inch 78rpm record could hold <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> of sound per side and the 10-inch size was the standard size for popular music, almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length. For example, when King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, including Louis Armstrong on his first recordings, recorded 13 sides at Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana, in 1923, one side was 2:09 and four sides were 2:52–2:59.|$|E

The Bills drove to the Cincinnati 21-yard line with <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> left to play, and it appeared that Ferguson completed a fourth-down pass to Lou Piccone to gain a first down. However, Buffalo was called for a delay of game penalty, and Ferguson's pass attempt on the next snap fell incomplete.

40|$|A {{critical}} observation {{for testing}} the KRM jet model, in development at FIU, is to observe high time resolution, high accuracy photometry and polarimetry {{over a wide}} range of frequencies in the optically thin portion of the synchrotron spectrum. The detection of micro-variability during these observations would be ideal so the background and flaring components could be separated. Target of opportunity H-band photometry and polarimetry observations on the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) 10. 4 -m with the Canarias InfraRed Camera Experiment (CIRCE) instrument were made in conjunction with the Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy (SARA) JKT observing in the optical VRI bands in order to test the model. Here we present simultaneous micro-variability observations of Blazar S 5 0716 + 71 made on 14 April 2017, with the CIRCE instrument on the GTC 10. 4 -m telescope and optical observations made with the 1. 0 -m SARA JKT in La Palma. The CIRCE observations consisted of high time resolution polarimetric observations in the H band over a period of 2. 4 h on source, measuring both the H-band flux and the polarization degree and angle. Simultaneous observations with the SARA JKT 1. 0 -m yielded VRI light curves with <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> time resolution over ∼ 4 h. 0716 + 71 showed only small amounts of variability during the observation.
