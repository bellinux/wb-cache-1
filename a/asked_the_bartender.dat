50|$|The {{next morning}} after {{spending}} the night with Kevin, Sharon calmly gets dressed, unperturbed by the bloody sheets and Kevin's dead body on the bed. At the office, the team spends the day researching any past incidents connected to D'Oblique. Their search turns up a badly mutilated woman and an eviscerated man. While Doyle and Cordelia look for more links, Angel goes back to D'Oblique {{to see if he}} can spot the killer. On his way in, Angel bumps into Kate, who takes umbrage when he tries to warn her of a suspiciously non-specific danger. Inside, Angel finds out that Kevin disappeared after going home with Sharon. He finds her in the phone book and runs straight to her place to try to prevent the next murder. Angel arrives at the apartment {{just in time to see}} that Sharon is dead while Neil, the geeky guy she took home, is alive and hosting a parasitic demon. Angel and the demon fight, but it gets away just as Kate arrives and finds Angel at the crime scene. Pulling a gun on Angel, Kate reveals she's a detective with the LAPD, and tries to arrest him. Knowing Kate won't be convinced he's not the killer, Angel breaks away and dives out the third floor window. Meanwhile, the demon goes back to D'Oblique. As dawn approaches, Angel makes his way to Cordelia's dingy apartment, not knowing that Kate has gone to illegally search his own place. Waking Cordelia and Doyle, Angel asks them to research eviscerating burrowers - demons that move from body to body, endlessly seeking the perfect one to live in forever. They discover their burrower is vulnerable to fire. Seeking help to destroy the powerful demon, Angel calls Kate and requests a meeting to prove that he isn't the killer. That night at <b>the</b> club, Kate <b>asks</b> <b>the</b> <b>bartender</b> to notify her when Angel arrives. A few minutes later <b>the</b> <b>bartender</b> tells Kate he thinks Angel is out back but, when they get there, <b>the</b> <b>bartender</b> smashes a wine bottle into the back of Kate's head. Angel arrives just in time to keep the burrower demon from transferring to Kate's body, forcing it back inside <b>the</b> <b>bartender.</b> Though weakening, <b>the</b> <b>bartender</b> host is still strong enough to fight Angel until Kate recovers. Then, not wanting to deal with them both at once, the demon tosses Kate and Angel down into the basement and locks them in.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Schenk became {{acquainted with the}} history {{and culture of the}} Hmong while working in a factory in Minnesota.

Years later, he was deciding how to develop a story involving a widowed Korean War veteran trying to handle the changes in his neighborhood when he decided to place a Hmong family next door and create a culture clash. He and Dave Johannson, Schenk's brother's roommate, created an outline for the story. According to Schenk, each night he used a pen and paper to write the script while in Grumpy's, a bar in northeastern Minneapolis, while not working at his day jobs. He recalled writing 25 pages within a single night in the bar. He recalled <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> <b>bartender,</b> who was his friend, questions about the story's progress.

This article describes an exercise that uses nddles to expose students to important as-pects of the process and experience of scientific thinking. Science {{has been described}} as a process of puzzle solving (Kuhn, 1970). The use of riddles described in this article is useful in demonstrating to students, especially those in in-troductory or experimental design classes, key points con-cerning scientific thinking as well as the process and experi-ence of being a scientist. Students are told that they will participate in an exercise involving scientific thinking. They are given the following information. You are walking in the desert and find a man lying face down with a pack on his back, dead. How did he die? Students are told that the instructor will respond to any yeslno questions. After several false starts, the class arrives at the correct answer: The man is a parachutist whose chute failed to open. Students are dividedl into small groups and given the following series of riddles, 'one at a time, with one member of each group receiving the answer and serving as moderator. A.

However, he will not go home because a man wearing a mask is waiting there for him. What does the first man do for a living? (He's a baseball player standing on third base.) C. A man is found shot to death in a room with a table, four chairs, and 53 bicycles. 7 hy was he shot?
