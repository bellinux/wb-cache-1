5|$|The 1891 census {{records the}} Wildes' {{residence}} at 16 Tite Street, {{where he lived}} with his wife Constance and two sons. Wilde though, not content with being better known than ever in London, returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the salons littéraires, including the famous mardis of Stéphane Mallarmé, a renowned symbolist poet of the time. Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists and The Duchess of Padua, had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome filled his mind. One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him to write in it what he had been saying. The result was a new play, Salomé, written rapidly and in French.|$|E
2500|$|According to Adams, {{the idea}} for the title {{occurred}} to him while he lay drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria, gazing at the stars. He was carrying a copy of the Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him that [...] "somebody ought to write a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". He later said that the constant repetition of this anecdote had obliterated his memory of the actual event.|$|E
2500|$|Ray had {{not thought}} about a trilogy while making Aparajito, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him only after being asked about the idea in Venice. The final {{installation}} of the series, Apur Sansar (The World of Apu), was made in 1959. A number of critics find {{this to be the}} supreme achievement of the trilogy (Robin Wood, Aparna Sen). Ray introduced two of his favourite actors, Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore, in this film. The film finds Apu living in a nondescript Kolkata house in near-poverty. He becomes involved in an unusual marriage with Aparna, the scenes of their life together forming [...] "one of the cinema's classic affirmative depiction of married life", but tragedy ensues. After Apur Sansar was harshly criticised by a Bengali critic, Ray wrote an article defending it—a rare event in Ray's filmmaking career (the other major instance involved the film Charulata, Ray's personal favourite). His success had little influence on his personal life in the years to come. Ray continued to live with his mother, uncle and other members of his extended family in a rented house.|$|E

60|$|DEAR BRANDER,--I haven't {{been out}} of my bed for four weeks, but--well, I have been reading, a good deal, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> me {{to ask you to}} sit down, some time or other when you have 8 or 9 months to spare, and jot me down a certain few {{literary}} particulars for my help and elevation. Your time need not be thrown away, for at your further leisure you can make Colombian lectures out of the results and do your students a good turn.|$|R

60|$|His eyes {{rested on}} many objects that he recognised, but as his glance {{travelled}} <b>to</b> <b>and</b> fro <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him {{that much of}} what he saw conveyed a hint that economy was needful.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, no," [...] she answered. [...] "To {{tell you}} the truth though, I am quite a {{stranger}} in London, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me that Mr. Courtlaw {{might have been able to}} give me an idea where to stop." ...|$|E

60|$|As {{she spoke}} she saw Rachel redden; for she remembered silly {{things she had}} said, <b>and</b> also, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> her that she treated this {{exquisite}} woman rather badly, for Mrs. Dalloway had said that she loved her husband.|$|R
