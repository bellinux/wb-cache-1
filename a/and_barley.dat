Paddy husk impressions in some potsherds indicate Neolithic involvement in cultivating rice and cereals such as wheat, moong, masoor, <b>and</b> <b>barley.</b> Both cultivated and wild rice was harvested during summer and again during winter. The wild forms of rice are Oryza rifipogon and Oryza perennis, from which Oryza sativa (Asian rice) originated.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{severely}} curtailed {{tobacco production}} {{in favor of}} more sustainable crops, including wheat, corn, rye, <b>and</b> <b>barley.</b> This reduced the soil depletion inherent to tobacco production, and allowed for the practice of crop rotation. He also planted fruit orchards, including peach and apple trees, which he used to produce spirits. In 1801 Richard constructed a dairy, which ran primarily under the supervision of his wife Elizabeth Collins Lee.|$|E

5|$|As {{far back}} as the Iron Age, Welsh folk were using wild cereals to create a coarse bread. By the time the Romans invaded, Celtic skills with bread had progressed to the point that white or brown breads could be produced. The Roman {{invasion}} led to many Welsh people moving to the less hospitable uplands, where the only cereal crops which could be grown were oats, barley and rye. Oat <b>and</b> <b>barley</b> breads were the main breads eaten in Wales up until the 19th century, with rye bread created for medicinal purposes. Oats were used to bulk out meat or meat and vegetable stews, also known as pottage.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{settlement}} recognising {{his claim to}} Morley's music patent, Barley seemingly {{found it difficult to}} enforce his rights, even with his new role as a stationer. Less than half of the known music books published from 1606 to 1613 recognised Barley's rights on the imprint. Barley took Thomas Adams to the Stationers' court in 1609, challenging the copyrights of the music books Adams had published. The court handed down a settlement similar to the one between East <b>and</b> <b>Barley.</b> However, none of the music books Adams published afterward contained any recognition of Barley's patent.|$|E

5|$|From about 4000 BC, Neolithic {{settlers}} arrived introducing cereal cultivars, domesticated animals such {{cattle and}} sheep, large timber building, and stone monuments. Field systems {{were developed in}} different parts of Ireland, including at the Céide Fields, that has been preserved beneath a blanket of peat in present-day Tyrawley. An extensive field system, arguably the oldest in the world, consisted of small divisions separated by dry-stone walls. The fields were farmed for several centuries between 3500 BC and 3000 BC. Wheat <b>and</b> <b>barley</b> were the principal crops.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the primary}} {{agricultural}} product from Rancho Camulos was wine. Ninety acres (360,000 m²) of vineyards were planted in the 1860s and Camulos wines and brandies were known throughout Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. In 1870, records indicate Camulos was largest of the four vintners in the San Buenaventura Township of Santa Barbara County, with 45 tons (40,900kg) of grapes grown, making 6,000 US gallons (23,000 L) of wine and 800 US gallons (3,000 L) of brandy. In addition to oranges and grapes, the ranch produced almonds, walnuts, apricots, wheat, corn <b>and</b> <b>barley.</b> Flower petals from roses grown at Camulos were shipped to Europe to make perfume.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the French government's anger against Morocco was increasing. A {{series of}} {{incidents}} in October 1849 damaged relations between both countries; {{a series of}} assassinations directed at the French frontier had occurred, and the French Consul had requested the dismissal of Pacha Ouchda, who was believed to have caused these issues. From 1845 to 1851, Morocco had a serious agricultural crisis caused by a drought, resulting in crop failure. The people of Morocco were suffering {{as the price of}} wheat <b>and</b> <b>barley</b> reached unprecedented heights. In Salé, many people were starving, and the agricultural crisis and anger towards France ultimately led to the bombardment of Salé.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} {{agricultural}} production {{was determined by}} the land and climate. The cold and wet climate meant that more oats <b>and</b> <b>barley</b> were grown than corn. The evidence of bones indicates that cattle were by far the most important domesticated animal, followed by pigs, sheep and goats, while domesticated fowl were very rare. Bone evidence indicates that there was a significant growth in the fish trade around 1000. This increased marine exploitation of the Highlands and Islands may have been {{as a result of the}} arrival of Scandinavian settlers in this period.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the advent}} of agriculture, humans were hunter-gatherers. They foraged for edible fruit, nuts, stems, leaves, corms, and tubers, {{scavenged}} for dead animals and hunted living ones for food. Forest gardening in a tropical jungle clearing {{is thought to be}} the first example of agriculture; useful plant species were identified and encouraged to grow while undesirable species were removed. Plant breeding through the selection of strains with desirable traits such as large fruit and vigorous growth soon followed. While the first evidence for the domestication of grasses such as wheat <b>and</b> <b>barley</b> has been found in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, it is likely that various peoples around the world started growing crops in the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC. Subsistence agriculture continues to this day, with many rural farmers in Africa, Asia, South America, and elsewhere using their plots of land to produce enough food for their families, while any surplus produce is used for exchange for other goods.|$|E

5|$|Blackleg is a {{fungal disease}} of canola {{that results in}} major yield loss in {{affected}} crops. It overwinters on infected stubble (leftover crop residue) that is left on farm fields, and can continue to produce spores, infecting future crops, until the stubble is buried or broken down completely. The observation that C.olla grows and fruits on canola stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade canola stubble, and {{reduce the incidence of}} stubble-borne diseases like blackleg and blackspot. In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, C.olla was shown to colonize canola, wheat, <b>and</b> <b>barley</b> residue, but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of canola as compared to the cereal residue.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the University of Leicester Archaeological Services {{decided to}} {{excavate}} the presumed {{location of the}} abbey's kitchens, to clarify the layout of that area of the abbey. These first excavations located both {{the north and south}} walls and a 15th–16th-century brick oven, confirming that it was indeed the kitchens. The area excavated was enlarged in 2003, with the south-west corner of the building and a second oven uncovered: this corner had not been entirely robbed of stone, with two courses of sandstone remaining. The second oven was found to contain charcoal, fragments of wheat <b>and</b> <b>barley,</b> fish-bones and hazelnuts. A drain identified in the 1930s excavation was also located, and found to contain small bones, fish-scales, and the bones of rats who had formerly lived in the drain.|$|E
5|$|Plants were {{cultivated}} {{mostly in}} small nearby gardens, but wheat <b>and</b> <b>barley</b> were also grown on small fields obtained by burning the forest.

Further out were the pastures, the entire area utilized by a single settlement having a radius of about 5km. Cattle, sheep and goats were even more numerous in the northern flatlands, where the land was less fertile.

They were also farmers and gardeners, growing corn, wheat, rye, <b>and</b> <b>barley.</b> Many were potters, and pottery {{can be found in}} abandoned villages. The Anasazi usually constructed temporary dwellings out of sticks and leaves, often using bark for the roofs. Occasionally they built more permanent dwellings out of rocks, usually along the side of a mountain, often large enough to accommodate several families. Storage pits were often placed behind the rock dwellings. Settlements were typically small, as food was scarce. A group of Virgin Anasazi lived in what is now the Red Cliffs Anasazi Site in Red Cliffs Recreation Area.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{cultivated}} emmer <b>and</b> <b>barley,</b> {{and several}} other cereal grains, {{all of which were}} used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer.

These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing. Papyrus growing {{on the banks of the}} Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.|$|E
5|$|The early Middle Ages were {{a period}} of climate deterioration, with a drop in {{temperature}} {{and an increase in}} rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. With a lack of significant transport links and wider markets, most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet of meat, dairy products and cereals, supplemented by hunter-gathering. Limited archaeological evidence indicates that throughout Northern Britain farming was based around a single homestead or a small cluster of three or four homes, each probably containing a nuclear family, with kinship relationships likely to be common among neighbouring houses and settlements, reflecting the partition of land through inheritance.
