500|$|In 1856, Tucker {{completed}} his four-volume History of the United States, From Their Colonization to the End of the 26th Congress, in 1841. Robley Dunglison commented as follows on the work: [...] "To aid {{him in the}} execution of his work, as [...] himself remarks, it had been his good fortune to have a personal knowledge of many, who bore a conspicuous part in the Revolution, and of nearly all those who were the principal actors in the political dramas which succeeded. The history extends to the elevation of General William Henry Harrison to the Presidency in 1841, which {{is as far as}} Tucker thought he could prudently go." [...] The work includes <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> slavery, in which Tucker took issue with Jefferson's decades-old view in his Notes on the State of Virginia (1781), that slavery still had a degenerative effect upon slaveholders.|$|E

The last scene, showing Santa Anna's surrender [...] "as a common soldier," [...] is rather obscure. One wonders why he did it. In all other scenes the action is clear and effective. It would be a stolid audience indeed that failed to respond to the thrilling scene inside the Alamo." [...] The Moving Picture Worlds review stated that [...] " [...] is a very thrilling and altogether satisfactory reproduction of an important historical episode. The company deserves the highest commendation for the picture and the way it is produced." ...|$|E

Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly, gave <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the album saying that Youthanasia would [...] "impress, but not impact." [...] Neil Arnold of Metal Forces named the record [...] "the last true Megadeth opus before the mid-to-late 90s slump". He further {{said that the}} album [...] "pales" [...] {{in comparison to the}} previous records, but still keeps the band in their element. Paul Corio, in a retrospective review for Rolling Stone, wrote that the album features [...] "metal-machine music" [...] that is [...] "calibrated to kill". He highlighted [...] "Elysian Fields" [...] and [...] "Victory" [...] as examples of Mustaine in his prime. Despite the outcry of some fans, Pete Prown called Youthanasia [...] "more than worthy follow-up" [...] to Countdown to Extinction.

500|$|Nosaka {{announced}} his intentions to go abroad to study social {{theory in the}} November 1918 issue of Rodo Oyobi Sangyo. He sailed out of Kobe harbor in July 7, 1919, and arrived in London on August 27. After his arrival, Nosaka studied political economy at London University. Like many British intellectuals at the time, Nosaka deepened his studies of Marxism, and became a confirmed communist at the university. While in London Nosaka became active in communist circles. He affiliated himself with notable trade union leaders active in London, and attended the September 8–13, 1919 Glasgow Trade Union Congress as a correspondent for Rodo Oyobi Sangyo. Nosaka was {{a founding member of}} the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1920, and attended the Party's first session as a representative from London. Nosaka's activities within the Communist Party brought him to the attention of Scotland Yard, and Nosaka was deported from Britain in 1921. After he left Britain, Nosaka traveled through Europe to the newly formed Soviet Union. In Russia, with the help of friendly contacts in the communist hierarchy, Nosaka became influential within the Communist Party. Nosaka was suspected of being either a British or Japanese agent; but, because of his contacts among high-ranking Finnish and Russian leaders, Nosaka was never purged. Nosaka wrote <b>A</b> <b>Brief</b> <b>Review</b> <b>of</b> the Labour Movement in Japan. It was published by the International Council of Trade and Industrial Unions in 1921 ...|$|E

It then turns to the deep quantum regime of operation of optomechanical oscillators and cover selected aspects of quantum state preparation, control and characterization, including mechanical squeezing and pulsed optomechanics. This is followed by a discussion of the "bottom-up" approach that exploits ultracold atomic samples instead of nanoscale systems. It concludes with an outlook that concentrates largely on the functionalization of quantum optomechanical systems and their promise in metrology applications...|$|R

6000|$|In {{the course}} of my next lesson, I made a report of the other devoirs, dealing out praise and blame in very small retail parcels, {{according}} to my custom, for there was no use in blaming severely, and high encomiums were rarely merited. I said nothing of Mdlle. Henri's exercise, and, spectacles on nose, I endeavoured to decipher in her countenance her sentiments at the omission. I wanted to find out whether in her existed a consciousness of her own talents. [...] "If she thinks she did a clever thing in composing that devoir, she will now look mortified," [...] thought I. Grave as usual, almost sombre, was her face; as usual, her eyes were fastened on the cahier open before her; there was something, I thought, of expectation in her attitude, as I concluded <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the last devoir, and when, casting it from me and rubbing my hands, I bade them take their grammars, some slight change did pass over her air and mien, as though she now relinquished a faint prospect of pleasant excitement; she had been waiting for something to be discussed in which she had a degree of interest; the discussion was not to come on, so expectation sank back, shrunk and sad, but attention, promptly filling up the void, repaired in a moment the transient collapse of feature; still, I felt, rather than saw, during the whole course of the lesson, that a hope had been wrenched from her, and that if she did not show distress, it was because she would not.|$|E
