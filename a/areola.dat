5|$|Alphonse <b>Areola</b> (born 27 February 1993) is a French {{professional}} footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain. An academy graduate of PSG, {{he spent the}} early parts of his career on loan, enjoying spells with Lens, Bastia and La Liga side, Villarreal. During his stint with the latter, <b>Areola</b> broke the club record for the longest period of play without conceding a goal, remaining unbeaten {{for a period of}} 620 minutes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Areola</b> {{represented}} France {{at every}} youth level from U16 to U21 between 2008 and 2014. He was the hero for France in the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup Final. Having ended goalless after extra-time, the match {{went to a}} penalty shoot out where <b>Areola</b> saved spot-kicks from Uruguay's Emiliano Velázquez and Giorgian De Arrascaeta to lead his nation to their first ever triumph in the tournament. He had previously featured for France at the 2010 UEFA European Under-17 Championship and the 2012 UEFA European Under-19 Championship's, and subsequently at the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June 2015, La Liga side Villarreal {{announced}} {{the signing of}} <b>Areola</b> on season-long loan {{as a replacement for}} regular 'keeper Sergio Asenjo who had suffered a long-term injury the season before. He made his debut for the club on the opening day of the season in a 1-1 draw with Real Betis. At Villarreal, <b>Areola</b> enhanced his burgeoning reputation by keeping 15 clean sheets in 37 matches and conceding only 26 goals as the club ended the season in fourth place in La Liga. His clean-sheet tally for the league season was bettered by only two goalkeepers, Jan Oblak of Atlético Madrid, and Claudio Bravo of Barcelona. <b>Areola</b> also broke the club record of 615 minutes of football played without conceding a goal which was previously held by Diego López, ultimately going 620 minutes unbeaten before conceding against Las Palmas. Outside of domestic football, the Frenchman featured in the Europa League {{for the first time in}} his career, making five appearances as El Submarino Amarillo reached the semi-finals where they lost out to eventual runners-up, Liverpool.|$|E
40|$|Areolae of the crustose lichen Rhizocarpon geographicum (L.) DC., {{are present}} on the {{peripheral}} prothallus (marginal <b>areolae)</b> and also aggregate to form confluent masses in {{the centre of the}} thallus (central <b>areolae).</b> To determine the relationships between these <b>areolae</b> and whether growth of the peripheral prothallus is dependent on the marginal <b>areolae,</b> the density, morphology, and size frequency distributions of marginal <b>areolae</b> were measured in 23 thalli of R. geographicum in north Wales, UK using image analysis (Image J). Size and morphology of central <b>areolae</b> were also studied across the thallus. Marginal <b>areolae</b> were small, punctate, and occurred in clusters scattered over the peripheral prothallus while central <b>areolae</b> were larger and had a lobed structure. The size-class frequency distributions of the marginal and central <b>areolae</b> were fitted by power-law and log-normal models respectively. In 16 out of 23 thalli, central <b>areolae</b> close to the outer edge were larger and had a more complex lobed morphology than those towards the thallus centre. Neither mean width nor radial growth rate (RaGR) of the peripheral prothallus were correlated with density, diameter, or area fraction of marginal <b>areolae.</b> The data suggest central <b>areolae</b> may develop from marginal <b>areolae</b> as follows: (1) marginal <b>areolae</b> develop in clusters at the periphery and fuse to form central <b>areolae,</b> (2) central <b>areolae</b> grow exponentially, and (3) crowding of central <b>areolae</b> results in constriction and fragmentation. In addition, growth of the peripheral prothallus may be unrelated to the marginal <b>areolae...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new <b>areolae</b> on the marginal hypothallus of the lichen Rhizocarpon geographicum (L.) DC was studied after complete or partial removal of the central <b>areolae.</b> New <b>areolae</b> developed slowly on the isolated hypothalli over two years. Development was similar when the <b>areolae</b> were completely removed and when the central <b>areolae</b> were separated from the marginal hypothallus by ‘moats’ 2 to 5 mm in width. However, in intact thalli, the marginal <b>areolae</b> developed rapidly during Jan. – June 1986 but showed periods of retreat from the margin during Oct. - Dec. 1985 and July – Sept. 1986. These results suggested that primary <b>areolae</b> may develop from free-living algal cells trapped by the hypothallus while secondary <b>areolae</b> may develop from zoospores produced by the thallus. Complete removal of the <b>areolae</b> resulted in no measurable radial growth of the marginal hypothallus over 18 months. Removal of the central <b>areolae</b> to within 1 and 2 mm of the hypothallus significantly reduced growth. These {{results suggest that the}} <b>areolae</b> may supply the hypothallus with carbon for growth. When the marginal hypothallus was experimentally removed a new hypothallus developed within one year. Regeneration occurred initially by retreat of the marginal <b>areolae</b> and later by new hyphal growth. The concentration of ribitol, arabitol and mannitol was measured in the <b>areolae</b> and marginal hypothallus on four occasions in 1985 / 6 in a population growing on a steep south facing rock surface. The three carbohydrates were present in significantly higher concentration in the <b>areolae</b> than in the hypothallus. Hence, the slow growth of this species may result from inhibited transport of carbohydrate from <b>areolae</b> to hypothallus...|$|R
5000|$|The {{size and}} shape of <b>areolae</b> and nipples are also highly variable, with those of women usually being larger than those of men and prepubescent girls. Human <b>areolae</b> are mostly {{circular}} in shape, but many women and some men have <b>areolae</b> that are noticeably elliptical.|$|R
5|$|On 23 July 2013 he was loaned to Ligue 2 side RC Lens, {{who were}} managed by former PSG manager Antoine Kombouaré, for the 2013–14 Ligue 1 season. <b>Areola</b> {{immediately}} displaced Rudy Riou as the club's starting 'keeper and made 36 appearances for the campaign, included in which was his Coupe de France debut. He also helped {{the club to}} a second-place finish in the league, thereby earning promotion to Ligue 1. Areola's performances {{throughout the course of}} the season earned him the Ligue 2 Goalkeeper of the Year award and a spot in the Team of the Season. <b>Areola</b> was also awarded the Eurosport Revelation of the Year award, beating the likes of N'Golo Kante and Gaëtan Bussmann. A verbal agreement was in place for <b>Areola</b> to remain with Sang et Or on loan for the following season but the club's financial position raised concerns with the League's National Directorate of Management Control and ultimately put pay to the possibility of him returning.|$|E
5|$|<b>Areola</b> {{has played}} for France at all youth levels. He is also {{eligible}} {{to play for}} the Philippine senior team due to his parents being both of Filipino heritage and in 2011 was personally invited by team manager Dan Palami to consider playing for the national team.|$|E
5|$|<b>Areola</b> {{would get}} a chance in Ligue 1, however, as Claude Makélélé's Bastia stepped in to sign him on loan for the 2014–15 Ligue 1 campaign, with the deal being {{completed}} on 26 July 2014. Signed as the replacement for the retired Mickaël Landreau, he made his debut for the club on 9 August in a 3–3 draw with Marseille. <b>Areola</b> ultimately made 39 appearances across all competitions for the club, keeping 13 clean sheets as Bastia ended the Ligue 1 season in 12th place and as runners-up in the Coupe de la Ligue. The Final, which took place on 11 April, was contested between Bastia and Areola's parent club PSG, with the match ending 4–0 in favour of the Parisians.|$|E

40|$|Carbohydrate {{concentrations}} in the marginal hypothallus and <b>areolae</b> of the crustose lichen Rhizocarpon geographicum (L.) DC. were measured in north Wales, U. K. using gas chromatography. Ribitol, arabitol, and mannitol were the most abundant carbohydrates while a- glucose ß-glucose, fructose, sucrose, and trehalose were present in smaller amounts. The concentrations of arabitol, ribitol, mannitol, fructose, and a-glucose were greater in the <b>areolae</b> while the concentration of trehalose was greater in the hypothallus. Concentrations of carbohydrates varied little between sample days. Concentrations of polyols in the hypothallus {{were not correlated with}} those in the <b>areolae.</b> These results suggest: 1) the hypothallus has a lower demand for carbohydrates than the <b>areolae</b> or there is limited transport from <b>areolae</b> to hypothallus, 2) increased trehalose in the non-lichenised hypothallus may be an adaptation to withstand stress and desiccation, and 3) polyols are partitioned differently in the hypothallus and <b>areolae...</b>|$|R
50|$|Acarospora fuscata ("brown {{cobblestone}} lichen") is {{a glossy}} pale or yellowish-brown areolate lichen with angular <b>areolas</b> that grows up to 10 cm wide on non-calcareous rock in {{low and high}} elevations. It grows in Europe and North America. It grows in southern California and on {{the eastern part of}} the Sierra Nevada range. It may grow with the <b>areolas</b> disconnected. The <b>areolas</b> may lift at the edges, but the <b>areolas</b> do not overlap like true squamules (sub-squamulose). More common in the Sierras is the similar species Acarospora thamnina, which is truly squamulose with overlapping scales.|$|R
5|$|The areolar glands {{are in the}} <b>areola</b> that {{surrounds}} the nipple in the female breast. These glands secrete an oily fluid that lubricates the nipple, and also secrete volatile compounds that are thought {{to serve as an}} olfactory stimulus for the newborn. During pregnancy and lactation these glands, also called Montgomery's glands, become enlarged.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{successful}} stint in Spain, <b>Areola</b> returned to PSG for the 2016–17 Ligue 1 season. He began the campaign as understudy to German keeper Kevin Trapp, who had signed the season before, {{and was in}} PSG's match-day squad for their 4–1 Trophée des Champions victory over Lyon. He made his first appearance following his return on 13 September in a 1–1 Champions League draw with Arsenal, in what was also his debut in the competition. Following the match against Arsenal, <b>Areola</b> established himself as PSG's first-choice goalkeeper and had kept four clean sheets in eight appearances by mid-October. However, he suffered a downturn in form soon after and ultimately relinquished his place to Trapp after a string of matches in December in which he conceded 10 goals from just 11 shots faced. In April the following year, he was an unused substitute as PSG beat Monaco 4–1 to claim a record fourth straight Coupe de la Ligue title but started in a 1–0 win over Angers which saw PSG lift the Coupe de France title the following month.|$|E
5|$|On 18 May 2013, having progressed {{through the}} club's academy, <b>Areola</b> made his senior debut for PSG, {{replacing}} first-choice goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu in the 48th minute of a 3–1 home win over Brest. PSG had been crowned Ligue 1 champions {{prior to the}} match and their opponents were already relegated. He made his first start for the club the following weekend in a 3–1 win over Lorient, playing 61 minutes in what was the final match of the season before being substituted for fourth-choice 'keeper Ronan Le Crom, who was sent off later in the match for a foul on Julien Quercia.|$|E

40|$|A lichen is an {{intimate}} association between an alga and a fungus and {{is regarded as}} one of the best examples of ‘mutualism’ or ‘symbiosis’ involving microorganisms. In lichens which have Trebouxia as the algal partner, photosynthesis by the algae results in the production of the soluble polyol ribitol which is then transported to the fungus where it is converted to arabitol and mannitol. Within the fungus, arabitol may act as a short-term carbohydrate reserve while mannitol may be involved in stress resistance. The crustose lichen Rhizocarpon geographicum (L.) DC., has an unusual thallus structure consisting of discrete granules (<b>areolae)</b> containing the algal component growing in association with a non-lichenised fungal hypothallus that extends beyond the <b>areolae</b> to form a marginal ring. The concentrations of ribitol, arabitol, and mannitol were measured, using gas chromatography, in the central <b>areolae</b> and marginal hypothallus of the crustose lichen Rhizocarpon geographicum (L.) DC. growing on slate rocks in north Wales, UK. The concentrations of all three polyols were greater in the central <b>areolae</b> than in the marginal hypothallus. In addition, the ratios of polyols in the marginal hypothallus to that in the central <b>areolae</b> varied through the year. The concentration of an individual poyol in the hypothallus was correlated primarily with the concentrations of the other polyols in the hypothallus and not to their concentrations in the <b>areolae.</b> Low concentration of ribitol, arabitol, and mannitol in the marginal hypothallus compared with the central <b>areolae</b> suggests either a lower demand for carbohydrate by the hypothallus or limited transport of polyols from <b>areolae</b> to hypothallus, and may explain the low growth rates of this species. In addition, polyols appear to be partitioned differently through the year with an increase in mannitol compared with arabitol in more stressful periods...|$|R
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of {{a single piece of}} elastic cartilage with a complicated relief on its inner surface and a fairly smooth configuration on its posterior surface. A tubercle, known as Darwin's tubercle, is sometimes present, lying in the descending part of the helix and corresponding to the ear-tip of mammals. The earlobe {{consists of}} <b>areola</b> and adipose tissue. The symmetrical arrangement of the two ears allows for the localisation of sound. The brain accomplishes this by comparing arrival-times and intensities from each ear, in circuits located in the superior olivary complex and the trapezoid bodies which are connected via pathways to both ears.|$|E
5|$|Traces of red pigment {{still remain}} on the figure's body that was {{originally}} painted red overall. The feathers of her wings and the owls' feathers were also colored red, alternating with black and white. By Raman spectroscopy the red pigment is identified as red ochre, the black pigment, amorphous carbon ("lamp black") and the white pigment gypsum. Black pigment is also found on {{the background of the}} plaque, the hair and eyebrows, and on the lions' manes. The pubic triangle and the <b>areola</b> appear accentuated with red pigment but were not separately painted black. The lions' bodies were painted white. The British Museum curators assume that the horns of the headdress and part of the necklace were originally colored yellow, just as they are on a very similar clay figure from Ur. They surmise that the bracelets and rod-and-ring symbols might also have been painted yellow. However, no traces of yellow pigment now {{remain on the}} relief.|$|E
25|$|Morphologically {{the breast}} is tear-shaped. The superﬁcial tissue layer (superficial fascia) is {{separated}} from the skin by 0.5–2.5cm of subcutaneous fat (adipose tissue). The suspensory Cooper's ligaments are fibrous-tissue prolongations that radiate from the superficial fascia to the skin envelope. The female adult breast contains 14–18 irregular lactiferous lobes that converge at the nipple. The 2.0–4.5mm milk ducts are immediately surrounded with dense connective tissue that support the glands. Milk exits the breast through the nipple, which {{is surrounded by a}} pigmented area of skin called the <b>areola.</b> The size of the <b>areola</b> can vary widely among women. The <b>areola</b> contains modified sweat glands known as Montgomery's glands. These glands secrete oily fluid that lubricate and protect the nipple during breastfeeding. Volatile compounds in these secretions may also serve as an olfactory stimulus for the newborn's appetite.|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{substances}} {{exchange between}} microalgae and environment occurs through the pores {{on the surface}} of its coat. Therefore, characteristics of substance flow are related to the total area of the pores of microalgae. Pores of centric diatoms are arranged in groups on the siliceous plates that cover the <b>areolae</b> of valves. The mathematical model that simulates the radial <b>areolae</b> arrangement on the valves of centric diatoms and on the basis of estimated number of <b>areolae</b> calculates the total area of the diatom pores is proposed. On the example of two diatom species Coscinodiscussp. and Thalassiosira eccentrica it was shown that their pores occupy 4 - 8 % and 7 - 14 % of total valve surface respectively. These values do not depend on the valve diameter and number of its <b>areolae</b> but are equivalent to the porosity of <b>areolae</b> of these species. It is supposed that about 10 % of valve surface takes part in substance exchange and 100 % of valve surface absorbs sunlight. Therefore substance flow through the valve is related to the energy flow (sunlight) as 1 : 10. It is suggested to use the ratio between total area of microalgae surface and area of its pores for the characteristics of microalgae productivity...|$|R
25|$|When {{the breast}} overfills with milk it becomes painful. Engorgement comes from {{not getting enough}} milk from the breast. It happens about 3 to 7 days after {{delivery}} and occurs more often in first time mothers. The increased blood supply, the accumulated milk and the swelling all contribute to the painful engorgement. Engorgement may affect the <b>areola,</b> {{the periphery of the}} breast or the entire breast, and may interfere with breastfeeding both from the pain and also from the distortion of the normal shape of the areola/nipple. This makes it harder for the baby to latch on properly for feeding. Latching may occur over only part of the <b>areola.</b> This can irritate the nipple more, and may lead to ineffective drainage of breast milk and more pain. Engorgement may begin as a result of several factors such as nipple pain, improper feeding technique, infrequent feeding or infant-mother separation.|$|E
25|$|Most swimsuits {{in western}} culture leave at least the head, shoulders, arms, and {{lower part of the}} leg (below the knee) exposed.

25|$|Latching on {{refers to}} how the baby fastens onto the breast while breastfeeding. A good latch means that {{the bottom of the}} <b>areola</b> (the area around the nipple) is in the baby's mouth and the nipple is back inside his or her mouth. A poor latch happens when the baby does not have enough of the breast in his/her mouth or is too close to the tip. This can cause cracked nipples and a {{reluctance}} to continue to breastfeed.|$|E

40|$|Removal of the <b>areolae</b> of the crustose lichen Rhizocarpon geographicum (L.) DC. {{resulted}} in either low or no measurable radial {{growth of the}} marginal hypothallus. Radial growth of the hypothallus was also significantly reduced compared with intact thalli when (1) <b>areolae</b> were removed to within 1 and 2 mm of the hypothallus and (2) a 5 mm wide ‘moat’ was created between the <b>areolae</b> and the hypothallus. Adding ribitol (0. 01 M) to isolated hypothalli at 3 -month intervals over 15 months results in total radial growth c. 60 % that of intact thalli. Adding an arabitol/mannitol mixture (0. 05 M arabitol, 0. 03 M mannitol) increased radial growth compared with deionized water and ribitol treatments. Adding ribitol (0. 7 M), arabitol (0. 2 M) and mannitol (0. 08 M) to the <b>areolae</b> of intact thalli had no significant effects on radial growth of the hypothallus. On a south-facing rock surface, isolated hypothalli grew at a similar rate to intact thalli for 2 months. Growth then declined and the hypothalli disappeared from the rock surface within 6 months. The effects of addition of carbohydrate suggest that the marginal hypothallus {{has the capacity to}} utilize exogeneous materials. However, in intact thalli in the field, the radial growth of the hypothallus {{is likely to be a}} result of transfer of materials from the <b>areolae</b> through hyphal connections...|$|R
