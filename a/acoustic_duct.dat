40|$|Local active {{noise control}} systems aim to produce zones of quiet {{at a number of}} desired {{locations}} within a sound field, such as the ears of an observer. The resulting zones of quiet are usually centered at the error sensors, and are often too small to extend from the error sensors to the observer’s ears. To overcome these problems, virtual sensing methods have been suggested. These methods are based on estimat-ing the error signals at a number of locations remote from the physical locations of the error sensors. By minimising the estimated error signals, the zones of quiet can be moved away from the error sensors to the locations where noise control is de-sired, i. e. the virtual locations. In this paper, the {{active noise control}} problem under consideration is analysed using a state-space model of the plant. Kalman filtering theory is then used to develop a virtual sensing algorithm that computes optimal estimates of the error signals at the virtual locations.

40|$|To achieve global {{wide-band}} {{noise reduction}} {{in a physical}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>duct,</b> actuating dynamics of the duct were described as two black-box transfer functions obtained by a hybrid system identification technique. The derived actuating, dynamics were then incorporated into a real-state-space <b>acoustic</b> <b>duct</b> model for active noise control (ANC). The relative dispositions of two sites, the secondary source and the performance point. along the duct were also investigated to eliminate the effect of lightly damped zeros seen in feed-forward ANC design. A better performance was obtained when the two sites were far apart and the secondary source was near to the primary noise source. Computer simulation analysis revealed noise reduction of 20 dB or more for periodic disturbance at a fixed frequency within 50 - 350 Hz, whereas there was 5 - 17 -dB noise reduction for that within 60 - 345 Hz in the real experiments. Less noise reduction near {{both ends of the}} frequency range (50 and 350 Hz) in experiments might result from the limited frequency range used for the system identification.

40|$|A popular {{approach}} for Active Noise Control (ANC) problems {{has been the}} use of the adaptive Filtered-X Least Mean Squares (FXLMS) algorithm. A fundamental problem with feedforward design is that it requires both reference and error sensors. In order to reduce the size, cost and physical complexity of the control system a feedback controller can be utilized. In contrast with FXLMS a feedback controller utilizes local velocity measurements of a sound-absorbing surface instead of global pressure measurements. Most control problems, including ANC, can be formulated in the General Control Configuration (GCC) architecture. This type of architecture allows for the systematic representation of the process and simplifies the design of a vast number of controllers that include H-infinity and H 2 sub optimal controllers. Such controllers are considered ideal candidates for ANC problems as they can combine near optimal performance with good robustness characteristics.
