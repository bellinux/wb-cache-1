25|$|It {{is during}} LH IIB that the {{dependence}} on Minoan ceramics is completely erased. In fact, {{looking at the}} pottery found on Crete during this phase suggests that artistic influence is now flowing in the opposite direction; the Minoans <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>using</b> Mycenaean pottery as a reference.|$|E

25|$|Glass milk bottles are now rare. Most people {{purchase}} milk in bags, plastic bottles, or plastic-coated paper cartons. Ultraviolet (UV) {{light from}} fluorescent lighting {{can alter the}} flavor of milk, so many companies that once distributed milk in transparent or highly translucent containers <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>using</b> thicker materials that block the UV light.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, archaeologists {{visually}} {{identify the}} geological origin of cherts using {{color and texture}} as the principal criteria. Officials and scientists from the Midwest to Missouri, Indiana, Alabama, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia, working together in workshops, <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>using</b> Neutron Activation Analysis, Macroscopic, microscopic, and geochemical identification techniques to help identify regional cherts and chert sources.|$|E
25|$|Usually, an {{emulsifying}} agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, {{though a}} few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes {{at the cost of}} a perfectly smooth texture.

25|$|In {{southern}} China, {{there are}} nearly no district heating systems. In northern China, district heating systems are common. Most district heating system which are just for heating instead of CHP use hard coal. For air pollution in China has become quite serious, many cities gradually <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>using</b> natural gas rather than coal in district heating system. There is also some amount of geothermal heating and sea heat pump systems.|$|E
25|$|Some {{value-added}} resellers <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>using</b> a {{flash drive}} {{as part of}} small-business turnkey solutions (e.g., point-of-sale systems).

Alternatively, the drive can be left inserted through the business day, and data regularly updated. In either case, the drive is removed at night and taken offsite.|$|E
25|$|Dolichovespula omissa {{is known}} to be a social {{parasite}} of D. sylvestris in Europe. D. omissa does not have a worker caste and instead the queens of this parasitic species have the workers of the host species raise their young. This is beneficial to D. omissa because {{they do not have to}} use resources to raise their young. In contrast, this is very bad for the tree wasp whose workers <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>using</b> their resources to raise offspring that are not related to them at all. Few details are known about the social parasite D. omissa or its effect on the nests of D. sylvestris.|$|E

25|$|Hurt {{economically}} by Peruvian Air Force interdiction {{efforts in}} the mid-1990s, drug traffickers <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>using</b> land and river routes as well as aircraft to transport cocaine paste and, increasingly, refined cocaine to consumers around {{and out of the}} country. The Air Bridge Denial program was suspended in April 2001 after the Peruvian Air Force and strength of the U.S. DEA misidentified a civilian aircraft as a drug trafficker and shot it down, killing two American citizens on board. Peru continues to arrest drug traffickers and seize drugs and precursor chemicals, destroy coca labs, disable clandestine airstrips, and prosecute officials involved in narcotics corruption.|$|E
25|$|In April 2007, the Cuba IPV Study Collaborative Group {{reported}} in the New England Journal of Medicine that inactivated (killed) poliovirus vaccine was effective in vaccinating children in tropical conditions. The Collaborative Group consisted of the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, Kourí Institute, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pan American Health Organization, and the World Health Organization. This is important because countries with high incidence of polio <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>using</b> live oral poliovirus vaccine. When polio is eliminated in a country, they must stop using the live vaccine, {{because it has a}} slight risk of reverting to the dangerous form of polio. The collaborative group found that when polio is eliminated in a population, they could safely switch to killed vaccine and be protected from recurrent epidemics. Cuba has been free of polio since 1963, but continues with mass immunization campaigns.|$|E
25|$|External beam {{radiation}} therapy uses a linear accelerator to produce high-energy x-rays that are directed in a beam towards the prostate. A technique called Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) {{may be used}} to adjust the radiation beam to conform with the shape of the tumor, allowing higher doses to be given to the prostate and seminal vesicles with less damage to the bladder and rectum. External {{beam radiation}} therapy is generally given over several weeks, with daily visits to a radiation therapy center. New types of radiation therapy such as IMRT have fewer side effects than traditional treatment. Eleven centers in the United States <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>using</b> proton therapy for prostate cancer, which uses protons rather than X-rays to kill the cancer cells. Researchers are also studying types of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to treat prostate cancer.|$|E

25|$|The Trojans and the Elixir of Power begins {{many centuries}} {{after the events}} of the main game. Morbus remains in a petrified state in {{territory}} now controlled by the Trojans, who are unaware of the other races, of Morbus's identity, or of the war against the Dark Tribe. The story begins when Morbus's assistant, Q'nqüra, spreads shadow-weed around the statue, releasing him. When the Trojans discover the statue gone and the effects of shadow-weed spreading, they elect to abandon the area. Landing on a new island, they encounter friendly Romans and hostile Mayans. Allying with the Romans, the Trojans tell them of the disappearance of Morbus's statue, and the Romans tell them the history of the war, and call a meeting of all four races. They are all shocked, however, when they learn the Dark Tribe <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>using</b> aerial vehicles, dubbed manacopters, to easily infiltrate their lines and inflict huge losses.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{assistance}} and training by USAID. The USAID-funded Watershed Management project strengthened {{the relationship between}} the Ministries of Health and Water related to water standards and regulations, Quality Assurance/Quality Control program for laboratories, and new procedures that aim at reducing water treatment plant shutdowns. A Water Demand Management (WDM) Unit was established at the Ministry of Water and Irrigation with assistance from USAID, and a WDM curriculum has been inserted into Jordanian classroom textbooks from grades 1 through 11. A Master's degree program has been established at Jordan University of Science and Technology, and journalists have been trained. Auditing and retrofitting of public and private buildings (hotels, schools, hospitals, government and commercial) indicated that 40 to 60% <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>using</b> water-saving devices. A “model” community was rehabilitated to demonstrate water and associated energy conservation. Twenty-seven grants have been awarded to poor communities to alleviate water shortages and inefficient water usage. Furthermore, training courses under a program with Washington State University have been completed for more than 800 employees from the Jordan Valley Authority, Water Authority of Jordan and Ministry of Water and Irrigation to improve and standardize accounting systems, and to improve efficiency.|$|E

500|$|The Katyn {{massacre}} was {{beneficial to}} Nazi Germany, which {{used it to}} discredit the Soviet Union. On 14 April 1943, Goebbels wrote in his diary: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>using</b> the discovery of 12,000 Polish officers, murdered by the GPU, for anti-Bolshevik propaganda on a grand style. We sent neutral journalists and Polish intellectuals {{to the spot where}} they were found. Their reports now reaching us from ahead are gruesome. The Führer has also given permission for us to hand out a drastic news item to the German press. I gave instructions to make the widest possible use of the propaganda material. We shall be able to live on it for a couple of weeks". The Germans won a major propaganda victory, portraying communism as a danger to [...] "Western civilization".|$|E
500|$|The fashion press {{tends to}} take special {{interest}} in First Ladies. The traditional role of a First Lady as the nation's hostess puts her personal appearance and style under scrutiny, and the attention to Pat was lively. Women's Wear Daily stated that Pat had a [...] "good figure and good posture", as well as [...] "the best-looking legs of any woman in public life today". Some fashion writers tended to have a lackluster opinion of her well tailored, but nondescript, American-made clothes. [...] "I consider it my duty to use American designers", she said, and favored them because, [...] "they <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>using</b> so many materials which are great for traveling because they're non crushable". She preferred to buy readymade garments rather than made-to-order outfits. [...] "I'm a size 10," [...] she told The New York Times. [...] "I can just walk in and buy. I've bought things in various stores in various cities. Only some of my clothes are by designers." [...] She did, however, wear the custom work of some well-known talents, notably Geoffrey Beene, {{at the suggestion of}} Clara Treyz, her personal shopper. Many fashion observers concluded that Pat Nixon did not greatly advance the cause of American fashion. Nixon's yellow-satin inaugural gown by Harvey Berin was criticized as [...] "a schoolteacher on her night out", but Treyz defended her wardrobe selections by saying, [...] "Mrs. Nixon must be ladylike." ...|$|E
