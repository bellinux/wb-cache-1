40|$|The {{international}} pet {{trade is}} {{a major source of}} emerging invasive vertebrate species. We used online resources as a novel source of information for <b>accidental</b> <b>bird</b> escapes, and we investigated the factors that influence the frequency and distribution of bird escapes at a continental scale. We collected information on over 5, 000 pet birds reported to be missing on animal websites during the last 15 years in Australia. We investigated whether variables linked to pet ownership successfully predicted bird escapes, and we assessed the potential distribution of these escapes. Most of the reported birds were parrots (> 90 %), thus, we analysed factors associated with the frequency of parrot escapes. We found that bird escapes in Australia are much more frequent than previously acknowledged. Bird escapes were reported more frequently within, or around, large Australian capital cities. Socio-economic factors, such as the average personal income level of the community, and the level of human modification to the environment were the best predictors of bird escapes. Cheaper parrot species, Australian natives, and parrot species regarded as peaceful or playful were the most frequently reported escapees. Accidental introductions have been overlooked as an important source of animal incursions. Information on bird escapes is available online in many higher income countries and, in Australia, this is particularly apparent for parrot species. We believe that online resources may provide useful tools for passive surveillance for non-native pet species. Online surveillance will be particularly relevant for species that are highly reported, such as parrots, and species that are either valuable or highly commensal.

50|$|Major {{foraging}} {{areas for}} vulnerable seabirds (albatrosses and shearwaters) tend to overlap with worldâ€™s richest fishing grounds, thus increasing {{the proportions of}} <b>accidental</b> bycatch of <b>birds.</b> Fisheries could also indirectly affect the trophic structure and foraging methods of seabirds. Since most sea birds are long-lived and have low reproduction rates, even a small increase in bird mortality could cause significant population declines.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the refuge is to provide nesting, resting, and feeding areas for waterfowl, {{primarily}} ducks. Two-hundred and forty-one avian species have been observed residing on or passing through the refuge; another fourteen <b>birds,</b> listed under <b>accidentals</b> on the <b>bird</b> list, have been reported but are not normally expected to be present. An important secondary purpose was to preserve a remnant flock of prairie chickens. Unfortunately, adequate grassland habitat to maintain a viable population of the birds was not available.|$|R
50|$|Being a great fish {{consumer}} and destroyer of fishing nets, {{it is often}} persecuted by fishermen. In Romania, pond drainage located on the inferior course of the Danube for agricultural purposes, the <b>accidental</b> death of <b>birds</b> captive in improvised fishing nets, nest destruction by professional fishermen {{in order to protect}} fish resources decreased of the number of individuals which put the species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List as a vulnerable species. It is also hunted in leisure activities, and in Iran the pygmy cormorant is commercialized for cooking.|$|R
40|$|Curing and {{treatment}} of <b>accidental</b> injuries in <b>birds</b> that have the nature of complex, old and contaminated wounds demand maximum caution from the surgeon. Birds, in particular wild fowl, are sensitive to manipulation during examinations and the diagnosis of the injuries. The estimate {{of the complexity of}} an injury and the general condition of the patient are of key importance for the correct choice of diagnostic procedures, anesthesia, and the operative procedure. The implementation of ketamine and diazepam for general injection anesthesia provides possibilities for the unhindered executing of the surgical procedure. The implementation of Kischner needles and pins is a good choice for the fixation of long bones in birds. The postoperative course in the patient requires constant medical and professional supervision which must be followed to the letter...|$|R
40|$|Seabirds {{scavenge}} baits {{from the}} hooks of commercial longlines, resulting in incidental seabird mortality and bait loss. As interactions between seabirds and longline fishing may cause decline in seabird populations and reduced gear efficiency, {{the potential for}} solving this problem by means of various mitigation measures has been tested. Four fishing experiments were conducted in commercial longlining in the north Atlantic to investigate {{the effectiveness of a}} bird-scaring line, underwater setting and a line shooter in reducing seabird bycatch during longline setting. These results are reviewed and the performance of the mitigation measures is evaluated. <b>Accidental</b> catches of <b>birds</b> were reduced by all three methods, most clearly by the bird-scaring line that had an efficiency of 98 - 100 %. The experiments also produced a reduction in bait loss and raised the catch rates of target species, which are important incentives for fishermen to employ mitigation measures...|$|R
40|$|Advanced fibre-reinforced polymer {{composites}} offer numerous {{advantages over}} metallic alloys, including higher specific strength and stiffness, {{resistance to corrosion}} damage and fatigue cracking. However, {{in the absence of}} through-thickness reinforcement, laminated composite materials are susceptible to interlaminar and intralaminar delamination damage due to <b>accidental</b> impact from <b>bird</b> strikes, hailstones, and tools dropped during maintenance. In addition, the low through-thickness conductivity of composites and its bonded structure presents challenges in protecting of aircraft against lightning strikes and detection of damage using traditional electrical based non-destructive techniques. In light of these challenges this PhD project investigated the effects of carbon nano-reinforcements alignment on the fracture and electrical properties of epoxy composites. The alignment of the nano-reinforcements was investigated using two different external field based techniques, namely electric-field and magnetic-field. The carbon nano-reinforcements used for the investigations include one-dimensional carbon nanofibres (CNFs) and two-dimensional graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). The project explores key parameters for reinforcing the epoxy composites with carbon nano-reinforcements, including their weight content, shape (one-dimensional and two-dimensional), orientation (random and aligned), and alignment techniques (electric- and magnetic-field). The PhD also investigates the influence of the alignment of CNFs on the damage detection ability of the CNF-reinforced epoxy adhesive bonded composite joints. The study showed that the addition of just 1. 0 wt% of aligned CNFs and GNPs increase the fracture energy of their epoxy nanocomposites by about eleven and seven fold, respectively. A mechanistic model is presented to quantify the contributions from the different toughening mechanisms induced by CNF and GNP nano-reinforcements which lead to the dramatic improvements in fracture toughness of the nanocomposites. The CNF-reinforced epoxy composites also showed a greater resistance to fatigue cracking when subjected to cyclic loading. The improved fatigue resistance of CNF-epoxy nanocomposites was due to a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic toughening mechanisms induced by the CNFs. In addition, the alignment of the nano-reinforcements also increased the electrical conductivity and simultaneously lowered the percolation threshold necessary to form a conductive network in the nanocomposites. Compared to the unmodified epoxy, the improvements in electrical conductivity of the nanocomposites with aligned CNFs and GNPs were increased by about ten and seven orders of magnitude, respectively. The improved electrical conductivity of the CNF-reinforced epoxy enabled real-time in-situ detection of fatigue cracking using a DC potential drop technique. A further study investigated the effects of using through-thickness nano-scale (CNFs) and micro-scale (z-pin) carbon reinforcements on the delamination resistance of carbon fibre-epoxy laminates. The delamination toughness of the composite laminate reinforced concurrently with CNFs and z-pins increased (by about 400 %) in comparison to the control laminate, suggesting a synergistic toughening mechanism. The new class of fibre composites with multi-scale through-thickness reinforcements offers a unique opportunity to greatly enhance the damage tolerance and its detection in advanced fibre composite materials...|$|R
