5|$|The {{need for}} new rolling stock on the western {{suburban}} tramways prompted Oslo Sporveier to order a modified version to the T1000. This was because they had plans to connect the eastern and western networks, and gradually convert the western lines to metro standard. The T1300 units were built with the same specifications as the T1000, but were also equipped with pantographs so they could operate on the light rail lines. They also had a slightly different front. The initial order was for 33 units, which were designated T5 and T6. The former 18 units had <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> in one end, while the latter 15 had <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> in both ends, allowing Oslo Sporveier to operate single-car trains. The new units were put into service on the Røa and Sognsvann Lines, and were also used on the Kolsås Line outside rush-hour.|$|E

5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E

5|$|Despite their celebrated {{success at}} turning {{spectacular}} plays in collaboration, {{relations between the}} teammates {{were said to have}} been often strained. Tinker and Evers feuded for many years. On September 14, 1905, Tinker and Evers engaged in a fistfight on the field because Evers had taken <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> to the stadium and left his teammates behind in the hotel lobby. They did not speak for years following this event. According to some tellings, Tinker and Evers did not speak to one another again following their fight for 33 years, until they were asked to participate in the radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series, between the Cubs and the New York Yankees. Neither Tinker nor Evers knew the other had been invited. However, in 1929, Tinker joined Evers in signing a ten-week contract to perform a theatrical skit on baseball in different cities across the United States.|$|E
5|$|In May and June 2010, Wu participated {{with his}} father in filming for the 17th season of The Amazing Race, an American reality {{television}} game show. Upon this announcement, {{it was also the}} first time his dad's name, Michael, was revealed, which was kept anonymous since his debut. Wu officially announced his participation on Facebook on September 1, and on YouTube a week later. The season premiered on September 26, 2010. Michael and Kevin's best placement was a third-place finish in Leg 2 and Leg 6. Their worst placement was a last place finish (9th) in Leg 3, a non-elimination leg. They ended up in seventh place and were eliminated in Leg 7 after being issued two 30-minute penalties for using <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> to travel between tasks on the leg when they were instructed to walk; another team had also issued a similar penalty and checked in after them, but only had one half-hour penalty, resulting in Kevin and Michael's elimination.|$|E

5|$|It was {{reported}} that the plan to rid Richter of the title was concocted by WWF Chairman Vince McMahon, who brought in Moolah after Richter refused to sign a new contract with the WWF. Richter, however, claims she was still under her original five-year contract, but that she regularly had disagreements with McMahon about her compensation. She also claims that when {{she arrived at the}} arena that day, she was surprised to find Moolah backstage, as she never showed up to events at which she was not scheduled to wrestle. After the match, an infuriated Richter left the arena in her wrestling gear, took <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> to the airport, and booked herself on a flight out of New York. Afterward, she never spoke to Moolah again.|$|E
5|$|The {{win over}} Edmonton began a streak where Calgary won five of six games, ending with another {{victory over the}} Oilers, 5–4 in a shootout, on October 26. The Flames ended October with {{consecutive}} home losses, to the Colorado Avalanche and Washington Capitals, in which they surrendered two-goal leads in both. The team entered November {{in the midst of}} a streak where they lost six of seven games. During the slump, rookie forward Brett Sutter was arrested in Scottsdale, Arizona, on charges that he assaulted <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> driver. Sutter apologized for the incident and his teammates issued a release expressing support, but he was demoted to Abbotsford a few days later. He was subsequently traded to the Carolina Hurricanes along with Ian White in exchange for defenceman Anton Babchuk and forward Tom Kostopoulos in a deal that was being discussed by the two teams prior to Sutter's legal troubles.|$|E
25|$|Cab {{arrangements}} vary by builder and operator. Practice in the U.S. {{has traditionally}} been for <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> {{at one end of}} the locomotive with limited visibility if the locomotive is not operated cab forward. This is not usually a problem as U.S. locomotives are usually operated in pairs, or threes, and arranged so that <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> is at each end of each set. European practice is usually for <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> at each end of the locomotive as trains are usually light enough to operate with one locomotive. Early U.S. practice was to add power units without cabs (booster or B units) and the arrangement was often A-B, A-A, A-B-A, A-B-B, or A-B-B-A where A was a unit with <b>a</b> <b>cab.</b> Center cabs were sometimes used for switch locomotives.|$|E

50|$|A B unit, in {{railroad}} terminology, is {{a locomotive}} unit (generally a diesel locomotive) {{which does not}} have <b>a</b> driving <b>cab</b> or crew compartment, and must therefore be controlled from another, coupled locomotive with <b>a</b> driving <b>cab</b> (<b>an</b> A unit). The terms booster unit and cabless are also used. The concept is largely confined to North America. Elsewhere, locomotives without driving cabs are rare.|$|R

25|$|Like {{most other}} {{commuter}} rail systems in North America, all trains are operated with <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> car {{from which the}} engineer can control the train. The cab car is typically {{at the head of}} trains traveling toward Washington to keep diesel fumes away from the terminal. To accommodate elevation gains, the locomotive is at the head of trains heading away from Washington. In the early 2000s a single unpowered EMD F cab unit, #7100 (ex-Baltimore & Ohio Railroad F7 #4553), occasionally substituted for <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> car. In addition to serving as a Non-Powered Control Unit, the unit is also outfitted with a head-end power generator to supply electricity to the train.|$|E
