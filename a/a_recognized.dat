40|$|AbstractThe mouse NK {{inhibitory}} Ly- 49 A receptor specifically {{interacts with}} a peptide-induced conformational determinant on its MHC class I ligand, H- 2 Dd.

Herein, however, we demonstrate that Ly- 49 <b>A</b> <b>recognizes</b> Dd mutants lacking N-glycosylation. Fucoidan competes for binding with anti-Ly- 49 A antibodies that inhibit Ly- 49 A–Dd interaction, and blocks apparent Ly- 49 A binding to unglycosylated Dd. We confirm that Ly- 49 <b>A</b> <b>recognizes</b> the α 1 and amino-terminal α 2 domains of Dd by analysis of recombinant H- 2 Kd-H- 2 Dd molecules. These studies indicate that Ly- 49 <b>A</b> <b>recognizes</b> carbohydrate-independent epitope(s) on Dd and suggest that Ly- 49 A has two distinct ligands, carbohydrate and MHC class I...|$|R

Chinese Indonesians {{tend to be}} more Christian than other Chinese ethnic groups of Southeast Asia due to a complex of {{historical}} reasons. Throughout the 20th century Chinese religion and culture was forbidden and persecuted in Indonesia, forcing many Chinese to convert to Christianity. The first wave of conversions occurred in the 1950s and 1960s, and the number of ethnic Chinese Christians during this period quadrupled. The second wave followed after the government withdrew Confucianism's status as <b>a</b> <b>recognized</b> religion in the 1970s.

English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism developed. She points out that buckets of apples {{were found in the}} Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still <b>a</b> <b>recognized</b> symbol of fertility in southwest England.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{hypopituitarism}} is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and some also an increased risk of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population. It has been difficult to establish which hormone deficiency is responsible for this risk, as almost all patients studied had growth hormone deficiency. The studies also do not answer the question as to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have <b>a</b> <b>recognized</b> adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.|$|E

5|$|While it is {{structurally}} {{similar to}} the Cotinga species, the purple-throated cotinga differs from them in {{that it has a}} heavier, stubbier bill, distinctive pale fringing on the back feathers, and barred underparts in the female. While it is still generally considered to be closely related to the Cotinga species, recent molecular analysis has suggested that the species may in fact form a separate clade with other canopy-dwelling cotingas, specifically the neotropical bellbirds of the genus Procnias, the cotingas of the genus Carpodectes, the black-faced cotinga of the monotypic genus Conioptilon, and the bare-necked fruitcrow of the monotypic genus Gymnoderus. Of these genera, the molecular analysis suggested that the purple-throated cotinga was most closely related to the neotropical bellbirds. This cotinga does not have <b>a</b> <b>recognized</b> subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Apart from team records, {{individual}} records were also broken in the match. Australia's Archie Thompson, who only had two international caps and one international goal {{prior to the}} match, scored 13 goals in the match and broke the record for most goals scored in an international match. David Zdrilic scored 8 goals and was widely reported as having recorded the second most goals scored in an international match, after Thompson's 13 goals. In fact, his figure was less than the previous record of 10 goals, which was achieved by Denmark's Sophus Nielsen at the 1908 Olympics and Germany's Gottfried Fuchs at the 1912 Olympics. Nevertheless, this made Zdrilic's total the second highest in almost 90 years. Thompson also equalled the world record for most goals scored in <b>a</b> <b>recognized</b> senior match, set in 1885 when John Petrie scored 13 goals in Arbroath's 36–0 win over Bon Accord in a Scottish Cup tournament. The previous record in a World Cup qualifying match was seven goals and was jointly held by another Australian, Gary Cole, against Fiji in the 1982 World Cup qualification on 14 August 1981, and Iranian Karim Bagheri, against Maldives in the 1998 World Cup qualification on 2 June 1997.|$|E
