In fact, this used to be the former eastern terminus of CR94, until it was extended beyond US 9W/US 202 in West Haverstraw. CR33 then proceeds into the town of Stony Point for the final mile and a half of its run. It intersects CR 98 and CR 100 before coming to an end at CR 106. It really would be impossible to extend CR33 further north as Bear Mountain State Park lies close to its northern terminus.|$|E
