5|$|Abduction of marriage-age {{women was}} common during the Liao dynasty. Khitans men of all social classes {{participated in the}} activity, and the abductees were both Khitan and Han. In some cases, this was {{a step in the}} {{courtship}} process, where the woman would agree to the abduction and the resulting sexual intercourse, and then the abductor and abductee would return to the woman's home to <b>announce</b> <b>their</b> intention to marry. This process was known as baimen (拜門). In other cases, the abduction would be non-consensual and would result in a rape.|$|E

5|$|The Octagon is also {{believed}} {{by some to}} be haunted by the spirits of African American slaves who once lived there. When the house held bells to summon servants, the spirits of the dead slaves would <b>announce</b> <b>their</b> presence by ringing these bells loudly. The ghostly bell ringing first occurred in the 1870s. General George D. Ramsay, Chief of Ordnance for the United States Army and commander of the Washington Arsenal in Washington, D.C., was attending a dinner at The Octagon when all the bells in the house began ringing. As Marian Gouverneur, wife of Samuel Laurence Gouverneur, Jr. (the first American consul in Foo Chow, China), related the story, General Ramsay seized the bell ropes to stop the bells from sounding, but to everyone's shock they did not stop ringing. Although Gouverneur's report was not made until 1911, the mysterious ringing of the bells had been reported in 1874 and again in 1889, each time attributed to the spirits of dead slaves.|$|E

5|$|The {{agitation}} {{was backed}} by Periyar's Self-Respect Movement and Justice Party. It also {{had the support of}} Tamil scholars like Maraimalai Adigal, Somasundara Bharathi, K. Appadurai, Mudiyarasan and Ilakkuvanar. In December 1937, Tamil Saivite scholars {{were among the first to}} <b>announce</b> <b>their</b> opposition to the Hindi teaching in the Saiva Sidhandha Maha Samaja conference at Velur. Women also participated in the agitation in large numbers. Moovalur Ramamirtham, Narayani, Va. Ba. Thamaraikani, Munnagar Azhagiyar, Dr. Dharmambal, Malar Mugathammaiyar, Pattammal and Seethammal were some of the women who were arrested for participating in the agitation. On 13 November 1938, the Tamil Nadu Women's Conference was convened to demonstrate women's support for the movement. The agitation was marked by anti-Brahmin sentiments as the protesters believed Brahmins were attempting to impose Hindi and Sanskrit over Tamil. Despite the general anti-Brahminism of the agitation, a few Brahmins like Kanchi Rajagopalachari also participated in the movement.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of the squads {{picked for}} the 2007 Cricket World Cup. This was the ninth Cricket World Cup tournament and was held between 14 March and 28 April 2007. The sixteen teams were asked to <b>announce</b> <b>their</b> final squads by 13 February 2007. Changes were allowed after this {{deadline}} at the discretion of the ICCs Technical Committee in necessary cases, such as due to player injury. In order to aid the teams to select the final fifteen, teams were given the option to announce a thirty-man squad by mid-January, with the understanding that the final squad would be picked from within these thirty players. However this was not strictly adhered to—several of England's final fifteen came from outside the initial thirty, for example.|$|E
5|$|A {{few of the}} Acadians {{migrating}} to the Miramichi River probably died of hypothermia during the trip due to the 1758–59 winter. Those who survived joined the refugees already present, who had been persuaded by Boishébert to seek refuge there. Inadequate housing and supplies, among other reasons, led to {{the deterioration of the}} reputation of the French commander, and only 700 Acadians remained there by late 1759. Meanwhile, the raiding rapidly took its toll on the residents who stayed around the Three Rivers, as food supplies became scarce and reconstruction became impossible. The fall of Quebec City in September 1759 also eliminated the possibility of assistance from that area. On 16 November 1759, the 190 Acadians in the region sent a delegate to Fort Beauséjour (which had been renamed Fort Cumberland) to <b>announce</b> <b>their</b> surrender to the newly promoted Colonel Frye. The settlements of Miramichi, Richibucto, and Bouctouche surrendered the next day, with a delegate sent to the fort to represent their 700 refugees. Frye requested and received permission from Governor Lawrence to take them in for the winter. The Acadian refugees were offered land on the Isthmus of Chignecto in early 1760, but most requested their original lands around the Three Rivers, which the governor granted.|$|E

5|$|The current voting format {{introduced}} in 1999 is a positional voting system, {{similar to that}} used at the Eurovision Song Contest. The voting is made up of two segments, in the first of which juries <b>announce</b> <b>their</b> votes; in the second segment the televoting result is announced. The total value of votes has usually been 2 x 473 points, which means that televotes and juries have an equal 50/50 weighing in the final result. The juries, usually 11, have represented either Swedish regions or, since 2010, countries participating in the year's Eurovision Song Contest. Each jury award 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 points to their top seven songs. After the jury voting, the televoting result is revealed by the hosts in ascending order. Between 1999 and 2011, the televoting points were fixed; the top seven songs would receive 11, 22, 44, 66, 88, 110 and 132 points. Starting in 2011, televoting points are given to each entry based on its percentage of total vote. If an entry receives 10% of the televotes it will be equivalent to 10% of 473 points, i.e. 48 points. The song with the highest number of points {{at the end of the}} voting is the winner.|$|E
5|$|Using ten {{orichalcum}} beads at a {{time would}} enable them to control the water with the powers they gained, keeping the sea level down to prevent an impending catastrophe. Unknowingly, Indiana starts the machine with the stones, upon which Kerner, Ubermann, and the Nazi troops invade the place and <b>announce</b> <b>their</b> intention to use the machine to become gods. The machine was responsible for creating the mutated skeletons seen earlier, but the Nazis believe that it will work on them due to their Aryan qualities. Ubermann wants to use Jones as a test subject, but Kerner steps onto the platform first, claiming himself to be most suitable for godhood. Just as Ubermann wants to start the machine, Jones mentions Plato's tenfold error, which convinces Kerner to use one bead instead of ten. He is then turned into a horribly deformed and horned creature, and falls into the lava. Indiana is forced to step on the platform next but threatens Ubermann with eternal damnation once he is a god. Fearing his wrath, Ubermann uses the machine on himself, feeding it one hundred beads. He is turned into a green ethereal being, but his form becomes unstable and he flies apart with an agonized scream.|$|E
