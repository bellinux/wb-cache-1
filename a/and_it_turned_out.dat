25|$|On March 16, 1998, it {{was exposed}} that the Drillers {{management}} had forgone getting medical insurance for their players, {{leading to a}} substantial controversy as the players had not been {{made aware of the}} situation and it was against league regulations.

The club quickly put together an insurance package before the next night's game in Cincinnati.|$|E
25|$|For a long time, lattice {{simulations}} {{seemed to}} indicate that the modified gluon and ghost propagators proposed by Gribov and Zwanziger were correct. In 2007, however, computers had become sufficiently strong to probe the region of low momenta, where the propagators are most modified, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> that the Gribovndash&Zwanziger picture is not correct. Instead, the gluon propagator goes to a constant value when the momentum is taken to zero, and the ghost propagator still goes like 1/k2 at low momenta. This is the case for both 3 and 4 space-time dimensions. A solution to this discrepancy has been proposed, adding condensates to the Gribovndash&Zwanziger action.|$|E

Assets worth $17 million were seized including eighteen luxury cars, giant screen TVs and works of art. According to Dotcom, about 80 police officers {{were involved in the}} operation; the New Zealand police claimed it was between 20 and 30.

25|$|Asus {{was founded}} in Taipei in 1989 by T.H. Tung, Ted Hsu, Wayne Hsieh and M.T. Liao, all four having {{previously}} worked at Acer as hardware engineers. At this time, Taiwan had yet to establish a leading position in the computer-hardware business. Intel Corporation would supply any new processors to more established companies like IBM first, and Taiwanese companies {{would have to wait}} for approximately six months after IBM received their engineering prototypes. According to the legend, the company created a prototype for a motherboard using an Intel 486, but it had to do so without access to the actual processor. When Asus approached Intel to request a processor to test it, Intel itself had a problem with their motherboard. Asus solved Intel's problem <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> that Asus' own motherboard worked correctly without the need for further modification. Since then, Asus was receiving Intel engineering samples ahead of its competitors.|$|E
25|$|Science and {{mathematics}} in the Islamic world during the Middle Ages followed various models {{and modes of}} funding varied based primarily on scholars. It was extensive patronage and strong intellectual policies implemented by specific rulers that allowed scientific knowledge to develop in many areas. Funding for translation of scientific texts in other languages was ongoing throughout the reign of certain caliphs, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> that certain scholars became experts in the works they translated and in turn received further support for continuing to develop certain sciences. As these sciences received wider attention from the elite, more scholars were invited and funded to study particular sciences. An example of a translator and mathematician who benefited from this type of support was al-Khawarizmi. A notable feature of many scholars working under Muslim rule in medieval times {{is that they were}} often polymaths. Examples include the work on optics, maths and astronomy of Ibn al-Haytham.|$|E

25|$|This time, Rytas, led by Renaldas Seibutis and Martynas Gecevičius, was {{successful}} – it won {{three games in}} a row (against VEF Rīga, EWE Oldenburg and Telenet Oostende), and qualified for the Euroleague. To strengthen the team roster before Euroleague games, Lietuvos rytas signed former NBA and Lithuania national team player Darius Songaila. On 18 October 2013, Lietuvos rytas started the 2013–14 Euroleague season with a 84–83 victory against Panathinaikos Athens after Renaldas Seibutis's winning shot in overtime. The game was named as the Euroleague's Game of the Week and re-broadcast in over 150 countries worldwide. However, after this, the level of play for the Lithuanian team dropped significantly and Rytas was not able to win any more games. 6 games were lost by 10 points or more <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> to be worst Lietuvos rytas season ever in Euroleague. Following the fiasco, coach Dirk Bauermann was replaced by Croat Aleksandar Petrović. The change helped and on 22 December 2013, Rytas crushed its rival Žalgiris with the result 90–58. After being eliminated in the Eurocup playoffs by KK Crvena zvezda, Lietuvos rytas also sufered a shocking defeat in the LKF Cup finals, losing to BC Prienai 91–92, leading to the firing of coach Aleksandar Petrović, who was replaced by Dainius Adomaitis.|$|E
25|$|Sherrard's {{touchdown}} {{made the}} score 21-10 going into halftime, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> {{to be the}} final score of the day for the offenses of both teams. Washington advanced inside the 49ers 15-yard three times in the second half, but failed to score on all of them. On their second possession of the half, they advanced 66 yards to the 49ers 7-yard line before defensive back Johnnie Jackson picked off a third down pass intended for Monk in the end zone. Early in the fourth quarter, Monk caught three passes for 63 yards on a drive to the San Francisco 15, only to see Rypien get hit as he threw a pass, which floated right into the hands of cornerback Darryl Pollard. Linebacker Monte Coleman quickly gave the Redskins another chance {{to get back in the}} game, intercepting a pass from Montana and returning it 18 yards to the 49ers 19-yard line with 10:28 left in regulation. Faced with fourth down and 5 from the 14, Rypien threw the ball to receiver Gary Clark in the end zone. Defensive back Eric Davis seemed to make contact with Clark before the ball arrived, but no flag was thrown and the pass fell incomplete, causing a turnover on downs. In the closing minutes of the game, 49ers linebacker Charles Haley deflected a pass from Rypien into the arms of 295 pound defensive tackle Michael Carter, who rumbled 61 yards to the end zone to make the final score 28-10.|$|E

Marsden left on 22 February 2010, and returned on 5 January 2012.

According to Inside Soap the police would begin questioning Phil's former fiancée Stella Crawford's death, teasing Marsden's return: [...] "The investigation is set to bring Phil face to face with his old nemisis, DCI Marsden – and this time she'll stop at nothing to put the bad boy permanently behind bars". Digital Spy reported that Marsden re-opens the investigation into Stella's death, [...] "suspecting that all is not what it seems".
