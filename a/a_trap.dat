5|$|Fishers are {{mentioned}} {{in several other}} books including The Blood Jaguar (an animal shaman), Ereth's Birthday (a porcupine hunter) and in The Sign of the Beaver, where a fisher {{is thought to have}} been caught in <b>a</b> <b>trap.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{modus vivendi}} had been {{achieved}} between Warwick {{and the king}} for some months, but the restoration of Henry Percy to Montagu's earldom of Northumberland prevented any chance of full reconciliation. <b>A</b> <b>trap</b> was set for the king when disturbances in Lincolnshire led him north, where he could be confronted by Warwick's men. Edward, however, discovered the plot when Robert, Lord Welles, was routed at Losecote Field, and gave away the plan.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>trap</b> crop is {{a crop of}} a {{plant that}} attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap crop can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, {{without the use of}} pesticides, possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E
5|$|In Survivor's Quest, Zahn's 2004 {{sequel to}} Vision of the Future, Luke and Mara journey to {{investigate}} the wreckage of Outbound Flight, a Jedi expedition destroyed by Thrawn years before.

5|$|In Winter of the Fisher, Cameron Langford relates {{a fictional}} {{encounter}} between a fisher and an aging recluse {{living in the}} forest. The recluse frees the fisher from <b>a</b> <b>trap</b> and nurses it back to health. The fisher tolerates the attention, but being a wild animal, returns to the forest when well enough. Langford uses the ecology and known habits of the fisher to weave a tale of survival and tolerance in the northern woods of Canada.|$|E

5|$|Returning to London, Angier debuts 'The Real Transported Man' {{where he}} vanishes within the machine's {{electrical}} field and appears atop the balcony {{at the back}} of the hall. Baffled by the trick's success, Borden sneaks backstage to find Angier's secret, only to witness Angier drop through <b>a</b> <b>trap</b> door and plunge into a waiting water tank, where he drowns. Cutter stumbles upon the scene, and Borden is arrested.|$|E
5|$|After Cersei {{fails to}} appear, Lancel Lannister {{is sent to}} {{retrieve}} her. Lancel follows one of Cersei's spies beneath the Sept, and finds a wildfire cache about to explode. He is stabbed in the spine before he can disarm the cache. Inside the Sept, Margaery Tyrell, realizing that Cersei has set <b>a</b> <b>trap,</b> warns the crowd to leave, but the High Sparrow prevents anyone from leaving. The wildfire ignites and destroys the Great Sept, killing everyone inside. King Tommen Baratheon witnesses the explosion from the Red Keep and commits suicide by jumping out a window.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with other}} Chetnik commanders, Baćović carried out {{numerous}} massacres of Bosnian Muslim and Catholic civilians and those {{sympathetic to the}} Partisan movement. In April 1945, he was captured near Banja Luka by elements of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia (HOS) along with Chetnik leaders Pavle Đurišić and Zaharije Ostojić, and Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić in what was apparently <b>a</b> <b>trap.</b> According to some sources, Baćović {{and the others were}} taken to the area of the Jasenovac concentration camp, where they were killed.|$|E
5|$|At the farm, the leprechaun lures J. D. into <b>a</b> <b>trap</b> by imitating a cat, biting and {{injuring}} his hand. Tory {{and the others}} rush him to the hospital, and the leprechaun follows on a tricycle. Alex and Ozzie visit a pawn shop {{to see if the}} gold is pure, and the leprechaun kills several townspeople. The leprechaun returns to the farmhouse, where he searches for his gold and shines every shoe. After leaving J. D. at the hospital, the group drives back to the farmhouse. Finding it ransacked, Nathan checks outside, where he is injured by a bear trap set by the leprechaun.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} statics and {{dynamics}} of a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) droplet bound by inter-species contact interaction in <b>a</b> <b>trapped</b> non-dipolar BEC. Our findings are demonstrated {{in terms of}} stability plots of a dipolar 164 Dy droplet bound in <b>a</b> <b>trapped</b> non-dipolar 87 Rb BEC with a variable number of 164 Dy atoms and the inter-species scattering length. <b>A</b> <b>trapped</b> non-dipolar BEC of a fixed number of atoms can only bind a dipolar droplet containing atoms less than a critical number for the inter-species scattering length between two critical values. The shape and size (statics) {{as well as the}} small breathing oscillation (dynamics) of the dipolar BEC droplet are studied using the numerical and variational solutions of a mean-field model. We also suggest an experimental procedure for achieving such a 164 Dy droplet by relaxing the trap on the 164 Dy BEC in <b>a</b> <b>trapped</b> binary 87 Rb- 164 Dy mixture...|$|R

Because of his illness, L'Ively is recruited to drive the family into Boston that night to attend a party at a luxury hotel. Mulder flies up to Boston to watch over the party with Green, hoping to set <b>a</b> <b>trap</b> for the suspect; Scully continues working on compiling a criminal profile of the killer.|$|E
5|$|Cádiz {{had been}} {{invested}} by the French in early 1810, leaving it accessible from the sea, but in March {{of the following}} year {{a reduction in the}} besieging army gave its garrison of British and Spanish troops an opportunity to lift the siege. A large Allied strike force was shipped south from Cádiz to Tarifa, and moved to engage the siege lines from the rear. The French, under the command of Marshal Victor, were aware of the Allied movement and redeployed to prepare <b>a</b> <b>trap.</b> Victor placed one division on the road to Cádiz, blocking the Allied line of march, while his two remaining divisions fell on the single Anglo-Portuguese rearguard division under the command of Sir Thomas Graham.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the motives}} they {{suggested}} for a forgery are not strong, and are contradictory; {{one is that}} Richard Owen wanted to forge {{evidence in support of}} Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set <b>a</b> <b>trap</b> for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.|$|E

5|$|Following Beauchamp's failed attempt, Cooke {{decided to}} lure Sharp {{to her house}} and kill him herself. Beauchamp wanted {{to take action to}} defend her honor, but she was {{determined}} to act for herself. He began teaching her to shoot a gun. Learning that Sharp was in Bowling Green, Cooke sent him a letter condemning Beauchamp's attempt on his life and asking to see him again. Sharp suspected <b>a</b> <b>trap,</b> but replied that he would meet her at the planned time. Hoping to kill Sharp before the meeting, Beauchamp traveled to Bowling Green, but found his target had already left for Frankfort. He had eluded the trap.
