2500|$|A plaque in the background, headed 'Letter to America, 2 January 1850' tells one family's sad story: [...] "I am now, I may say, {{alone in}} the world. All my {{brothers}} and sisters are dead and children but yourself... We are all ejected out of Mr. Enright's ground... The times was so bad and all Ireland in such a state of poverty that no person could pay rent. My only hope now rests with you, as I am without one shilling and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before</b> I must either beg or go to the poorhouse... I remain your affectionate father, Owen Larkin. Be sure answer this by return of post." ...|$|E
2500|$|I was on {{the verge}} of {{painting}} the Portrait of Jacques Nayral. He was to become my brother-in-law, and was one of the most sympathetic men I have ever met. A strange lad, a little surprising on first encounter - both disturbing because of his sharp use of irony and also attractive because of a generosity that left him as vulnerable as a child. The first time I met him was at President Bonjean's house at Villepreux-les-Clayes, near Versailles, during a dinner which brought together the committee of that 'Villa Medicis Libre' which, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> had been founded by Alexandre Mercereau. From that time onwards, we saw each other often and became friends.|$|E
2500|$|According to Collins, [...] "What we're {{in court}} {{deciding}} {{seems to be}} a level or two down from what, before we went into the jury, we supposed the trial was about, or had been initially about, which was who leaked [...] Some jurors commented at some point: 'I wish we weren't judging Libby. You know, this sucks. We don't like being here.' But that wasn't our choice." [...] Collins described how after 10 days of deliberations, [...] "What we came up with from that was that Libby was told about Mrs. Wilson nine times...We believed he did have a bad memory, but it seemed very unlikely he would not remember about being told about Mrs. Wilson so many times....Hard to believe he would remember on Tuesday and forget on Thursday." [...] Collins told the press [...] "Well, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> I felt like it was a long, you know, haul to get this jury done. And if Mr. Libby is pardoned, I would have no problem with that." ...|$|E
60|$|The priests, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> were {{accounted}} necromancers: {{the appearance}} of two of our three visitors might have justified the conceit.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{the unhappy}} {{cause of the}} change, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before!</b> ... Well, <b>as</b> you will! ... But human nature can't help being itself." ...|$|R
6000|$|My owners' letter {{had left}} it to me, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> {{to do my best}} for the ship, {{according}} to my own judgment. But it contained also a postscript worded somewhat as follows: ...|$|R
2500|$|Captain Frederick Benteen, {{battalion}} {{leader of}} Companies D, H and K, recalled his {{observations on the}} Custer battlefield on June 27, 1876:I went over the battlefield carefully {{with a view to}} determine how the battle was fought. I arrived at the conclusion I [...] now – that it was a rout, a panic, until the last man was killed…There was no line formed on the battlefield. You can take a handful of corn and scatter [...] over the floor, and make just such lines. There were none...The only approach to a line was where 5 or 6 [...] horses found at equal distances, like skirmishers [...] That was the only approach to a line on the field. There were more than 20 [...] killed there were [...] four or five at one place, all within a space of 20 to 30 yards …I counted 70 dead [...] horses and 2 Indian ponies.I think, in all probability, that the men turned their horses loose without any orders to do so. Many orders might have been given, but few obeyed. I think that they were panic stricken; it was a rout, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
60|$|No, Madam, said I, 'tis not certain, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> I {{question}} it.|$|E
60|$|MURRAY. Yes. (Carelessly.) Oh, {{he found}} me O.K. I'm fine and dandy, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I do;--though, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> it {{is a case}} {{of feeling}} sure, and not being sure. Had that Italian woman been really the widow, {{somebody}} would have brought her case forward more loudly." ...|$|R
60|$|But my {{relief was}} short-lived. That lioness, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> was a veritable devil. She {{stood for a}} moment glaring at us, then like a shot she sprang into the river and swam swiftly after us.|$|R
60|$|At length, having got room to speak, I {{told him}} that, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> <b>I</b> could deny him {{but one thing}} in the world; I was very sorry he should propose that thing only that I could not grant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Even so, your worship--for, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> as to that detestable joint, the babe unborn is no whit more blameless than--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, Mrs. Morton, {{for making the}} suggestion;--but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> I should prefer that he should employ--some one else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear child, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> women cannot {{understand}} these things. A {{man in my}} position can always command money for a new venture." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Bedouins {{were not}} with us, {{but we were}} to meet them, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> outside St. Stephen's gate. [...] "And {{if they are not}} there," [...] said Joseph, [...] "we shall be sure to come across them on the road." ...|$|R
60|$|Yet, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before</b> this, {{there are}} a great many adventures that I have not spoken of in this book. For I have told only those things that were {{necessary}} for to make you understand how it fared with him in his life.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will say}} again, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before</b> {{many times in}} these sittings, that I {{answered}} all questions of this sort before the court at Poitiers, and I would that you wold bring here the record of that court and read from that. Prithee, send for that book." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On Saturday he came again. Your {{father was}} gone, your uncle at home, and, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> {{they had a}} great deal of talk together.|$|E
6000|$|... "All the same, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> it's too bad of--of Carter to set you {{two babies}} {{on a job}} like this. Now, don't get offended, Miss--er----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If it hadn't {{been for}} that I--er--I don't know where you'd be now. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> I've been pretty bad--but {{not quite as}} bad as that." ...|$|E
60|$|He went, however, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>before</b> <b>said,</b> {{and troubled}} {{the people of}} Dunmore no longer, nor shall he again trouble us.|$|R
60|$|Although a cunning plotter and a scheming intriguer {{in his own}} interests, Chatellerault, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> was not {{by nature}} a quick man. His wits worked slowly, and he needed leisure to {{consider}} a situation and his actions therein ere {{he was in a}} position to engage with it.|$|R
6000|$|But if {{she felt}} any pique she quickly brushed {{it out of}} sight, for, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> {{she was a young}} woman who had great command of herself. Of course <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to her that I was very glad to have this chance of seeing her again, and she answered, with a laugh: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mary Armat {{was not an}} ill-natured girl, but, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> she was a high-spirited one, and was at {{the time}} in a state of justifiable irritation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wel, mister osten, as i wor saying, ive {{returned}} havin got nothin, bad skran to it, but a {{few small}} bits like a thimble, howsumeiver, that samell pay for sharpnin the tools, i now sit down to resoom me pen, <b>as</b> <b>i</b> <b>said</b> <b>before</b> i got up, but och! if ye heerd the row the other boys is goin on wid, yed find it as diffikilt to read this as i do to spel it. but niver mind, that saim dont mater much, for, <b>as</b> <b>i</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> im allways kooll.|$|E
60|$|The {{architecture}} of the Greeks and Romans themselves was not good, but it was natural; and, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> good in some respects, and for a particular time.|$|E
60|$|All {{kinds of}} {{handicrafts}} in the city, &c., tradesmen and mechanics, were, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> out of employ; and this occasioned the putting-off and dismissing an innumerable number of journeymen and workmen of all sorts, seeing {{nothing was done}} relating to such trades but what might {{be said to be}} absolutely necessary.|$|R
60|$|The postilions drove {{exceedingly}} fast all the {{way over}} the marshes. The stage stopped three times to change horses. Mr. George kept up a continual conversation with Rollo {{all the way}}, in order to prevent him from going to sleep; for, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> it is considered dangerous to sleep while on the marshes.|$|R
60|$|Ans. Although, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> {{the faith}} {{which is the}} {{justifying}} faith, {{is that of the}} holiest nature, yet in the act, by which it layeth hold of justifying righteousness, it respects it, simply, as a righteousness offered by grace, or given unto the person that by faith layeth hold thereon as he stands yet ungodly and a sinner.|$|R
60|$|But, Lord! (<b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before)</b> {{you smile}} pityingly, not bitterly, at this hubbub, and moralise upon it, in the calm evenings {{when there is}} no school at Sherborne.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{you see the}} sum {{of their}} commissions, for, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> for the {{substance}} of them {{they were the same}} {{that the rest of the}} noble captains had.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{rests with}} yourself. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> {{you are under}} {{discipline}} here, {{and you may not}} find existence such a bed of roses as it was in Eccleston Square." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And I,' said Fairford, 'am {{determined}} {{to go through with}} it. Trusting myself to you, Mr. Maxwell, I conceive that <b>I</b> rely, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>before</b> <b>said,</b> on the word of a gentleman.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a subject, my friend, {{on which}} I {{could not speak}} to her. All that was said came from her. Her mind was so fully made up, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> no advice from me could avail anything. With some people {{it is easy to}} see that whether you agree with them or differ from them it is {{impossible}} to turn them." ...|$|R
60|$|Fortunately Archie was a quick-witted lad, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> {{otherwise}} {{we should have}} been made prisoners in a twinkling; but he backed water with his oar before we were well out from the shadow of the old dock, thus forcing the skiff among the timbers instantly, and we three sat like statues, our hearts thumping loudly as trip hammers, waiting to learn whether the enemy had seen us.|$|R
