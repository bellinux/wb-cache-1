40|$|Two {{multi-turn}} coils {{are mounted}} vertically and positioned near each other along a common axis, coupled by an iron core <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> Figure 1. Changing current {{in the primary}} coil induces a voltage in the secondary coil, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> the video. When the iron core coupling the two coils is removed, the induced voltage becomes less than with the core, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> the video. The different effects of opening and closing the switch are clearly demonstrated...|$|R
30|$|The average pushing force {{required}} {{to operate the}} wheeled walker was 15  N, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> Fig.  16 a, when the participant walked up the slope. On the other hand, the average operating force for the prototype robotic cart was 5.5  N <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> Fig.  16 b. Also, the operating forces added to the handle grips became zero when the participant temporarily stopped during the operation, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> Fig.  16 b {{because there was no}} need to push the prototype robotic cart. In contrast, the pushing forces added to the wheeled walker remained over 5  N during the operation to maintain its stationary state <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> Fig.  16 a.|$|R

50|$|As {{illustrated}} in Figure 3, initially consider both L1 and L2 caches to be empty (a). Assume that the processor sends a read X request. It {{will be a}} miss in both L1 and L2 and hence the block is brought into both L1 and L2 from the main memory <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> (b). Now, again the processor issues a read Y request which is a miss in both L1 and L2. So, block Y is placed in both L1 and L2 <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> (c). If block X has to be evicted from L1, then it is removed from L1 only <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> (d). If block Y has to be evicted from L2, it is evicted from L2 only <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> (e).|$|R

30|$|First, the Canny {{operator}} [14] {{is applied}} to the color image, and <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> the top right panel in Fig. 3, gaps between the cloth parts are obtained as edges. On the other hand, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> the lower left panel, the contour of the cloth product is obtained. Then the folded cloth product is approximated to a quadrangle <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> the lower right panel. From this shape, the edge positioned on the camera side is selected, and processing of state estimation of folded parts is performed.|$|R

Now, assume the processor issues a read Y request which is a miss in both L1 and L2. So, block Y is placed in both L1 and L2 <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> (c). If block X has to be evicted from L1, then it is removed from L1 only <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> (d). If block Y has to be evicted from L2, it sends a back invalidation request to L1 and hence block Y is evicted from L1 <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> (e).|$|R
