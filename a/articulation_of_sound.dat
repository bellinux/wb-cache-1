40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} evolving <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> and image in contemporary culture, with particular reference to film. It argues that {{sound and image}} have undergone a historical machined separation, followed by a machined fusion or recombination. The machined fusion of sound and image has enabled the creation of soundful images, which are more than simply the sum of their parts. Through the infusion of sound, images are now routinely reinforced with a performed sense of presence, where they are made to sound more real, more powerful, more authentic. Through association with the image, sounds are reinforced {{to the extent of}} becoming 'realer than real'. By tracing the history of sound and image from their initial machined separation to their subsequent machined fusion, it will be argued that a new relationship has been created that has shaped an influential new mode of communication and perception...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cerebral palsy is {{the term}} used to {{describe}} a movement disorder though {{to be the result}} of nonprogressive brain damage. Due to damage to CNS, it is associated with articulation disorder and abnormal feeding reflex. Lack of oral function control and coordination following feeding reflex disorders. Articulation disorders are seen in most of the cerebral palsied patients. This research aimed to determine the relationship between feeding reflexes and articulation in cerebral palsy (spasticchildren). Methods: This study was cross sectionally carried out on 52 children with cerebral palsy, 5 to 10 yrs old, in rehabilitation centers and private clinics. The information related to feeding reflexes was collected through direct observation of patient and evaluation of sound articulation through phonetic information test. Results: Statistical analysis carried out by SPSS and chi-square and fisher exact tests. Abnomal chewing and tongue reflex are more prevalent than other feeding reflexes. The relationship between lip reflex and articulation of p/m/r/y/f/&# 269; and chewing reflex with articulation of/z/&# 353;/ is meaningful. The relationship between biting reflex with articulation of /z/j/l/&# 353;/ is meaningful. The relationship between tongue reflex and rooting reflex with <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> is not meaningful. Conclusion: With regard to the result of this research, it can be suggested that in children with cerebral palsy following feeding reflex disorders, abnormal posture during speech occurs that could have effect on articulation...|$|E
40|$|In my thesis, I {{argue that}} poet Susan Howe???s {{aesthetic}} of extreme grammatical and morphological fragmentation, archival appropriation, and figural representation in {{her collection of}} poems Singularities draws from her critical interpretation of the Antinomian Controversy???s significance for American literary history. She documents this interpretation in her book of essays entitled The Birth-mark: Unsettling the Wilderness in American Literary History. In that collection of essays, she establishes a counter-history of poetic nonconformity inspired by the dissent of the early Puritan Anne Hutchinson towards the Puritan ministry that founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony. This counterhistory contextualizes canonical authors such as Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, and Emily Dickinson, as well as lesser-known Puritan historical figures such as Hope Atherton and Mary Rowlandson in relation to Anne Hutchinson???s religious distinction between a covenant of works and a covenant of grace theological perspective of the written Word. Howe attributes contemporary forms of archival control of the poetic nonconformity of authors to a Puritan patriarchal tradition. She produces work that contributes to an antinomian aesthetic that defies such archival control while she also traces the existence of antinomianism in literary history within her poems. Singularities contains three poems: ???<b>Articulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sound</b> Forms in Time,??? ???Thorow,??? and ???Scattering as Behavior Toward Risk. ??? I devote one chapter to providing close readings {{of each of these}} poems with specific attention to the sources Howe draws from to cultivate her antinomian aesthetic and interpretive stance...|$|E

40|$|Henry Vaughan's Silex {{scintillans}} (1650 and 1655), {{a collection}} of 129 devotional poems, is essentially an imaginative account of the poet's spiritual regeneration. Vaughan lived {{at a time when}} traditions were threatened by the rising tides of rationalism and materialism; an authoritarian and hierarchical pattern of life was shattered by the tumultuous Civil War in the 1640 's. Inspired by the example and guided by the poetry of George Herbert, Vaughan abandoned secular verse and chose to counter the multiplicity and confusion of an increasingly godless age with the unity and order of his own private world of religious poetry, a world fully imbued with the divine presence. Although the influence of Herbert's The Temple may explain much about Vaughan's predilection for certain formal characteristics and something of his partiality for homely imagery and highly Biblical English, it is in the very finest achievements in Silex scintillans [...] such as "The Morning-watch", "The Night", and "Unprofitablenes" [...] that Vaughan stands most firmly upon his own considerable poetic abilities. [...] Vaughan's personal afflictions and the collective misfortunes of the unsettled times moved him to action only after his sensitivity was sharpened by the dawn of religious consciousness. The extreme tension between the worlds of matter and of the spirit, revealed to Vaughan by his new awareness, provides not only a fruitful subject but also appears in the contrasting nature of the symbolism of light and darkness, which in almost every poem modifies the imagery. Vaughan's important images are taken from external nature and are in themselves constant throughout Silex scintillans. But because a poem is a composition of images which stand as a manifestation of the poet's subjective impressions of reality as perceived as a particular time, the metaphorical implications of Vaughan's images grow proportionately to his developing attitudes. [...] A study of the relationship of imagery, prosody, and meaning in Silex scintillans suggests that Vaughan's collection has perhaps a more subtle but certainly no less valid unity than that in The Temple. As a work entire and sufficient in itself, Silex scintillans owes its continuity to a configuration of images ordered about the central metaphors of the divine spark, the spiritual pilgrimage, and the ultimate union with God who is Light. A careful consideration of representative pieces in parts I and II (originally published, respectively, in 1650 and 1655) indicates that the greatest of Vaughan's poetic achievements, when he attains it, is the felicitous <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> and meaning which produces a whole so very much more grand in the experience of it than the sum of contributive elements seem to warrant. part I is the product of an immutable faith in battle with a recalcitrant will; in Part II, Vaughan's state of mind is such that {{there is no doubt that}} the conflict is finished and that the city of palms is in sight...|$|E

A review of L 2 pronunciation research reveals that proposed pronunciation teaching methods tend to be based on the mechanical <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sounds</b> in order to approximate native-like pronunciation.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} Bachelor's {{thesis is}} to analyse the speech-language skills of a hearing-impaired boy. The thesis {{includes}} several language-based tasks. On {{the basis of the}} collected results, I compared the speech-language skills of the hearing-impaired boy with the speech-language skills of his peers with normal hearing. The language segment includes four tasks which cover the fields <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> semantics, morphology and syntax. The articulation task was based on the <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sounds</b> (consonants) <b>of</b> the Slovene literary language alphabet. The field of semantics was checked with tasks requiring formation of nouns, words from the same word group, synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms and hyponyms. The morphology tasks were based on determining prepositions, forming adjectives and verbs and finding odd words. The obtained results have proved that the speech-language skills of the hearing-impaired boy did not differ in a statistically significant manner from the speech-language skills of his peers with normal hearing. While the <b>articulation</b> skills <b>of</b> the hearing-impaired boy differed in a statistically significant manner from the <b>articulation</b> skills <b>of</b> his peers with normal hearing, the differences in the fields of semantics, morphology and syntax were not statistically significant. On the contrary – the hearing-impaired boy achieved better than average results in these three fields in comparison with his peers with normal hearing.
