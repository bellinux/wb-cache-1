40|$|In this work, {{supported}} amine sorbents {{were prepared}} by physical impregnation of silica and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) with tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) and studied for post-combustion CO 2 capture purposes {{in a lab}} scale circulating fluidized bed (CFB) reactor. Sorbent amine loading and support pore size effects were investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The sorbent CO 2 capacity {{was found to be}} a strong function of amine loading and pore volume. Significant improvement of the sorbent CO 2 adsorption capacity (3. 5 mol kg− 1) was achieved by tuning these variables. From preliminary testing of the fluidization behavior of PMMA based sorbent particles, it was found that, at high desorber temperatures, these sorbent particles formed aggregates plugging the reactor. This underlines the importance of not only evaluating sorbent capacity but also fluidization behavior in an early stage of process development. Continuous CO 2 capture was demonstrated applying the developed silica based sorbent particles in the CFB reactor. Here, CO 2 was captured from dry simulated flue gas applying a temperature difference of only 70 °C between the <b>adsorber</b> <b>column</b> (40 °C) and the desorber column (110 °C). To {{the best of our knowledge}} this was the first time, a high (90 %) purity CO 2 product gas was produced at the regenerator outlet in continuous mode using these supported amine sorbent...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{adsorption}} of H 2 O and CO 2 on Lewatit VP OC 1065 was studied {{in view of}} the potential application of this sorbent in post combustion CO 2 capture. Both CO 2 and H 2 O were found to adsorb on the amine active sites present on the pore surface of the sorbent material. However, where the interaction between CO 2 and the amine groups is chemical, the adsorption behaviour of H 2 O on Lewatit VP OC 1065 shows the characteristics of physical multilayer adsorption. The difference in interaction is also clearly reflected in the differences in the adsorption heat (View the MathML sourceΔHH 2 O= 43 [*]kJ[*]mol− 1, View the MathML sourceΔHCO 2 = 70 – 80 kJ mol− 1) and the capacity. The highest H 2 O capacity observed was 12. 5 mol kg− 1 (at 95 % RH). The highest CO 2 capacity observed was 2. 8 mol kg− 1 (303 K, PCO 2 PCO 2 = 81 kPa). Due to these high H 2 O capacities the sorbent material can adsorb practically all water that enters the <b>adsorber</b> <b>column</b> which increases the total energy demand of the sorbent based post-combustion capture process with 40 %. To prevent the co-adsorption of large quantities of water several options were analyzed using the adsorption isotherms obtained for CO 2 and H 2 O. Lowering the dew point of the flue gas upstream of the adsorber was identified as the most viable option...|$|E
30|$|From a {{technical}} point of view, several {{questions have been}} raised about the stability of the binding properties of albumin after passing the <b>adsorber</b> <b>columns</b> or about the influence and clinical relevance of some stabilizers (such as octanoate) used in commercial albumin preparations [28, 29]. Nevertheless, there are no definitive conclusions, and these issues should be the subject of further study in the future.|$|R

30|$|The Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) was {{originally}} developed by Stange et al. [8]. The technique {{has been available}} for broad clinical use since 1998. The system is composed of a blood circuit, an albumin circuit and a classic “renal” circuit. Blood is dialyzed through an albumin-impregnated high-flux dialysis membrane {{in such a way}} that hydrophobic albumin-bound toxins are released through the membrane and subsequently collected by albumin in the dialyzate. The method is based on two basic thermodynamic principles: protein-binding affinity and solute movement along a concentration gradient [9]. The elimination of toxins thus takes place through the diffusion process and depends on the free toxin concentration (which is mainly affected by the molar ratio of toxin to albumin). Toxins are cleared when passing the <b>adsorber</b> <b>columns</b> that contain activated charcoal and anion-exchange resin, and albumin is regenerated and able to accept new toxins when it passes the membrane again. Additionally, the albumin circuit itself is dialyzed in the CRRT (continuous renal replacement therapy) method, diminishing the load of water-soluble toxins.|$|R
40|$|Aim: Packed <b>adsorber</b> <b>columns</b> are {{densely packed}} whereas {{the design of}} {{unpacked}} columns allows mixing of the adsorber material using trapped air. Through this feature, the dead space of the unpacked column is higher and separation between plasma and elution fluids is less well defined. But contrary to unpacked columns in well packed column fluid channels may occur. This channeling phenomenon may affect the quantity of solute adsorbed in a negative manner. As the result of channel formation the adsorption capacity and the flow through of the packed column will decrease rapidly during the treatment. Method: A cartridge has been constructed with a flexible wall. With an external system, {{which can be used}} between the treatments, the adsorber cartridge volume can be changed so that plasma does not go lost. And on the other hand the channels can be destroyed and the columns can be packed again. Results: In the case that adsorption capacity or flow through the column is inadequate, {{it is not necessary to}} reject the column, because between treatments a system is installed to regenerate the column. In this regeneration process the volume of the column is increased so that the sorbent inside the column can be moved. The availability of more space makes it possible to destroy the channels and to regenerate all sorbent particles. After regeneration the column volume is decreased to a minimum, so that the column is packed again like a packed column. Conclusion: With the flexible cartridge we present a column with low plasma loss and an increased efficiency...|$|R
40|$|In a {{cryogenic}} establishment, {{helium gas}} {{is an expensive}} consumable. Conservation of helium is important not only for saving on cost, but also for ensuring supply {{at the time of}} need. During laboratory experiment, helium gas is often contaminated with air impurities (nitrogen, oxygen, argon, moisture etc.) which must be removed before the spent gas is reused for liquefaction. Therefore, a helium purifier {{is an integral part of}} any cryogenic establishment to conserve helium gas by providing grade 4. 5 helium or 99. 995 % pure helium to liquefier after separating air contaminants from impure helium. 					The helium purification is based on two principles, one is cryocondensation of moisture and air impurities, on heat exchangers at appropriate temperature and other one is cryosorption on activated charcoal to yield grade 4. 5 helium from 60 % pure helium at LN¬ 2 temperature and at high pressure of about 150 bar. The purifier has been designed for purifying impure helium upto 40 % of impurity by running 6 hours non-stop operation with the mass flow rate of 20 nm 3 /hr and delivery of impure helium to purifier at a pressure of 150 bar(a),which is ensured by a 3 -stage reciprocating compressor. In the helium purifier for cryocondensation and cryosorption process the components are moisture collector vessel, three heat exchangers, liquid air separator vessel and <b>adsorber</b> <b>columns.</b> Other major components are gas bag, compressor, LN 2 vessel and cylinder manifold. Where, all cryogenic components are housed in Superinsulated LN 2 vessel. Purification of helium involved two phase, one is regeneration phase and second is purification phase. For complete removal of moisture from charcoal beds regeneration should be done before purification, by heating and evacuation with purging of pure helium to whole system. And in purification phase we have taken 95 % of pure helium and 5 % of impurity i. e. dry nitrogen contaminants. Experiment was carried out for one session and four samples are taken in sample cylinder at different interval of time. Sample analysis by Linde Multi Component Detector reveals that the total impurity, consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and moisture is less than 5 ppm be volume, thus making the purified gas much better than grade 4. 5 helium...|$|R
40|$|Most helium liquefiers today {{operate on}} {{modified}} Claude cycle {{with at least}} two high speed turbo expanders. Impure gas cannot be fed to these liquefiers as air impurities solidify at low temperature, and damage the turbo expanders and choke the tubes. Therefore, a helium purifier {{is an integral part of}} any cryogenic establishment to conserve helium gas by providing Grade 4. 5 helium or 99. 995 % helium to the liquefier after separating air contaminants from impure helium. At present, research and academic centres in India, import helium purifiers which are very expensive in terms of foreign exchange. National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, has taken up a project for development of cryosorption based helium purifier funded by the Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences, Mumbai, which primarily aims at developing helium purifier and studying its performance. This dissertation details the design, fabrication and performance analysis of a prototype helium purifier. The purifier is based on the principle of cryocondensation of moisture and air impurities on heat exchangers at appropriate temperatures and cryosorption on activated charcoal to yield Grade 4. 5 helium from 60 % pure helium at LN 2 temperature. The purifier has been designed for 6 hours nonstop operation with throughput of 20 nm 3 /hr and delivery of pure helium at a pressure of 150 bar(a), which is ensured by a reciprocating compressor. The vital component, <b>adsorber</b> <b>columns,</b> was packed with Indian manufactured granular coconut shell activated charcoal in 50 NB Sch 80 SS 316 L pipe. Other major components include moisture collector vessel, liquid air separator vessel, three heat exchangers, snow filter, gas bag, cylinder manifold and superinsulated LN 2 vessel housing all cryogenic components of purifier. Helium gas bag, made of textile reinforced rubber has been successfully developed. All the components were fabricated, assembled and commissioned at NIT, Rourkela. Conditioning of the system was carried out by heating with six 1000 W tubular heaters, followed by evacuation. The system was back filled with Grade 4. 5 helium. Experiment was carried out for one session by feeding the purifier with 5 % dry nitrogen contaminant in helium as input gas, and four samples of purified gas were collected in sample cylinders at different intervals. Sample analysis by Linde Multi Component Detector reveals that the total impurity, consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and moisture, is less than 5 ppm by volume, thus making the purified gas much better than Grade 4. 5 helium...|$|R
40|$|This project aims at purifying para-chlorophenol {{contaminated}} industrial effluents by column adsorption using Chemviron Filtrasorb 400 (F 400) activated carbon. Two <b>column</b> <b>adsorbers,</b> namely, {{a constant}} diameter column (0 ° tapered) and a tapered column (5 ° tapered), have been operated under same {{conditions in the}} adsorption study. These two columns are operated with the same volumetric flowrate and activated carbon loading, but different values of initial concentration of para-chlorophenol. The para-chlorophenol concentration time curve (breakthrough curve) from each column run has been analyzed, and hence the characteristic of each <b>column</b> <b>adsorber</b> with different configuration has been evaluated. To predict the breakthrough curves for the para-chlorophenol/F 400 carbon system, the Homogeneous Surface Diffusion Model (HSDM), which includes {{the effect of the}} external mass transfer and the effect of the intraparticle mass transfer by the homogenous surface diffusion, is used. The SIPS equilibrium isotherm model has been incorporated with this model to describe the adsorption equilibrium at the interface of adsorbent solid and solution. This HSDM applies the Crank-Nicholson implicit finite difference method which was proposed by Mathews and Weber[1] for solving diffusion equations. In literature, it has hitherto been applied to fixed-bed adsorption systems on activated carbon [2 - 5]. The HSDM is modified to describe the dynamic adsorption process in tapered fixed bed <b>column</b> <b>adsorbers.</b> Due to the unique configuration of the tapered columns, the interstitial velocity of adsorbate flow is changing along the column, and hence gives a variable external mass transfer coefficient (k f), which has been used to represent the laminar boundary layer surrounding the F 400 carbon particle at different bed heights. The surface diffusion coefficient (D s) is assumed to be independent of the surface coverage of the F 400 carbon solids in this project. A constant surface diffusion coefficient is used to represent the migration of para-chlorophenol molecules on the surface or pore walls of the F 400 activated carbons. From the equilibrium time test, the para-chlorophenol/F 400 carbon system has been shown to attain equilibrium after 20 days under constant agitation. The adsorption pilot plant column study, however, is a dynamic process, in which the F 400 activated carbon did not possess a full adsorbing capacity in the duration of the column run. As a result, the bed utilization rate from the concentration time curve (breakthrough curve) is calculated to reflect the effective bed adsorption capacity towards para-chlorophenol in this dynamic process. With the introduction of this factor, the HSDM could provide a good fit to the experimental data. This new modified HSDM could be applied successfully to evaluate the dynamic adsorption behavior of para-ehlorophenol/ F 400 activated carbons in two different kinds of columns - constant diameter columns and tapered columns with different inclinations...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{adsorption}} {{of organic}} pollutants (an acid dye and para-chlorophenol) {{has been investigated}} via tapered <b>column</b> <b>adsorbers</b> using activated carbon. Equilibrium sorption isotherm experiments were determined to provide a crucial parameter, the saturation capacity (q(e)) of each pollutant by F 400 carbon, for operating continuous adsorption columns. The Redlich-Peterson isotherm gave the best fit model to describe the sorption process of these organic pollutants onto F 400 carbon. Adsorption studies of organic pollutants {{have been carried out}} in novel tapered fixed bed columns using activated carbon. A series of columns with different tapered angles, from one to five degrees, have been used. Experimental data obtained from the breakthrough curves have been analysed using the Bed Depth Service Time (BDST) model in this paper. However, the conventional BDST model has not been applied to tapered beds before, as the linear velocity of adsorbate is changing along the column. Therefore, some modifications have been developed to the original model. The extended-modified BDST model has proved to be successful in correlating the bed height and service time for tapered column adsorption...|$|R
40|$|The {{sorption}} {{of copper}} and cadmium ions onto bone char in single component systems {{has been studied}} using fixed-bed <b>column</b> <b>adsorbers.</b> The effects of solution flowrate, initial metal ion concentration and bone char particle size have been studied. A film-pore diffusion model has been developed to predict the fixed-bed breakthrough curves for the two metal ions. A sensitivity analysis {{has been carried out}} to investigate the influence of the external mass transfer coefficient (film resistance), the effective diffusion coefficient (pore diffusion) and the solid phase loading capacity. It is round that under the experimental conditions employed in the study, film diffusional resistance was tow and the Biot numbers were relatively high. Furthermore. a constant effective pore diffusivity was not sufficient to correlate the breakthrough curves accurately and a variable dependent effective diffusivity was required; suggesting a possible contribution front surface diffusion. Since the metal ion-bone char systems {{take a long time to}} reach equilibrium. the solid phase loading capacity as predicted by the "best-fit" equilibrium isotherm. was not Suitable for use in the diffusional mass transport model and the mass balance solid phase loading was utilised instead.

40|$|Human {{influenza}} vaccines are traditionally produced in embryonated chicken eggs. However, due to several disadvantages of this method, mammalian cell culture based influenza vaccine production processes {{are currently being}} established demanding new virus purification methods. Our study provides comprehensive results from three different strategies to capture Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell culture-derived influenza virus particles (A/Wisconsin/ 67 / 2005, A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34, B/Malaysia/ 2506 / 2004) based on affinity and pseudo-affinity adsorption. First, an affinity based capture step, lectin-affinity chromatography (LAC), was developed. This method was investigated concerning the selection of lectins and matrices, viral recoveries and contaminant depletion as well as process robustness. LAC showed {{a high degree of}} contaminant reduction, in particular host cell dsDNA depletion. The results from LAC represent a high potential of an affinity capture step {{at the beginning of a}} downstream process for production of viral vaccines. Influenza viruses have an affinity to sulfated carbohydrates, such as heparin or sulfated cellulose. Hence, column based Cellufine® sulfate is often used in industrial influenza virus purification. The main disadvantage of this method is the limited flow rate, due to high back pressure, leading to suboptimal process productivity. To overcome this drawback, we have developed a second capturing method for influenza viruses based on sulfated reinforced cellulose membranes (SCM). Compared to commercially available cation exchange membrane <b>adsorbers</b> and <b>column</b> based Cellufine® sulfate resin, these membrane adsorbers achieved high product recoveries and contaminant reduction. In addition, the SCM allow an increased flow rate during capturing leading to superior productivity compared to conventional bead chromatography. Hence, this method is an economic alternative for industrial influenza vaccine production. The third purification strategy was capturing of influenza viruses by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using zinc modified membrane adsorbers. This method shows valuable purification results for the influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34. However, IMAC depends highly on the primary structure of viral envelope proteins as well as the accessibility of certain amino acids. Hence, IMAC is an interesting capturing method of A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34 in a laboratory scale, but is only of limited interest for industrial vaccine production processes...|$|R

Control of annual spreading of influenza has centered on prophylactic vaccinations in combination with antiviral medications. Currently, efforts are undertaken to switch from conventional vaccine production processes using embryonated hen’s eggs, to continuous cell line cultures. Therefore, new downstream processing strategies have to be developed. One unit operation, which is often used in influenza virus purification, is column chromatography based on cellufine® sulphate. The main disadvantage of this method for this application is the limited flow rate due to the high back pressure, leading to a suboptimal productivity rate of the process. The present study describes a capturing method for cell culture derived influenza viruses based on sulphated reinforced cellulose membranes. Purification studies have been done using different MDCK cell derived influenza virus strains: A/Wisconsin/ 67 / 2005 (H 3 N 2), A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34 (H 1 N 1) and B/Malaysia/ 2506 / 2004.

40|$|Influenza is a global, highly {{contagious}} disease causing several million human infections every year. The most {{effective means of}} controlling seasonal influenza outbreaks is prophylactic vaccination. Current inactivated influenza vaccines contain either whole influenza viruses or viral membrane components. So called subunit vaccines for example consists mainly of the transmembrane glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA), which {{is regarded as the}} major immunogen of the influenza virus. In the present study a method for the purification of HA from viral and host cell (Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK)) membranes is presented. Extensive studies were done using different human influenza virus strains including two strains from the season 2007 / 08 (A/Wisconsin/ 67 / 2005 (H 3 N 2), B/Malaysia/ 2506 / 2004) and A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34 (H 1 N 1). After chemical inactivation (beta-propiolactone) of the culture broth the viral and host cell membranes were solubilized by a combination of different detergents. Remaining particles were removed by sequential centrifugation and filtration. Subsequently, the supernatant was diafiltrated against phosphate buffered saline to remove salts and free detergents. Further depletion of detergents in the broth was achieved by hydrophobic interaction chromatography using Amberlite XAD- 4 as a resin. Purification was performed by a combination of two affinity chromatography steps using (1) sulfated reinforced cellulose membrane <b>adsorbers</b> and (2) <b>column</b> based lectin-affinity chromatography. As a final polishing step size exclusion chromatography was included to the process. The recovery of HA based on single radial immunodiffusion (SRID) as well as the purity by the means of non-reducing SDS-PAGE were analyzed.

40|$|Process {{equipment}} {{models are}} needed in all stages of chemical process research and design. Typically, process equipment models consist of systems of partial differential equations for mass and energy balances and complicated closure models for mass transfer, chemical kinetics, and physical properties. The scope of this work is further development of the moment method for modeling applications {{that are based on}} the one-dimensional axial dispersion model. This versatile model can be used for most process equipment, such as chemical reactors, <b>adsorbers</b> and chromatographic <b>columns,</b> and distillation and absorption columns. The moment method is a numerical technique for partial differential equations from the class of weighted residual methods (WRM). In this work it is shown with examples how the moment method can be applied to process equipment modeling. The examples are: catalyst activity profiles in fixed-bed reactors, dynamic modeling of chemical reactors and fixed-bed adsorbers with axial dispersion, and steady-state and dynamic modeling and simulation of continuous contact separation processes with or without axial dispersion. An innovative field of application of the moment method is continuous-contact separation processes. The advantage of the moment method, compared to the state-of-the-art nonequilibrium stage model, is that the same level of numerical accuracy can be achieved with fewer variables. In addition, the degree of axial dispersion can be controlled precisely since only physical axial dispersion is introduced via the axial dispersion coefficient. When using axial dispersion models, special attention has to be paid to the boundary conditions. Using the moment transformation it is shown that the Danckwerts boundary conditions are appropriate for time-dependent models in closed-closed geometries. An advantage of the moment method, compared to other weighted residual methods such as orthogonal collocation on finite elements, is the ease with which boundary conditions are specified. The boundary conditions do not arise as additional algebraic equations. Instead, they simply appear as additive source terms in the moment transformed model equations. The second part of this thesis deals with the detailed closure models that are needed for process modeling. Relevance of some of the closure models is scrutinized in particular with two test cases. The first test case is gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients in trickle-bed reactors. It is shown that the correlation of Goto and Smith is appropriate for gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients in industrial trickle-bed reactors. The second test case is vapor-liquid equilibrium model parameters for binary systems of trans- 2 -butene and cis- 2 -butene and five alcohols. The Wilson model parameters for all binary systems are fitted against measurements with a total pressure apparatus. The measured pressure-composition profiles are compared against predictions by the UNIFAC and UNIFAC-Dortmund methods...|$|R
