50|$|Abaoji {{ordered the}} {{development}} of a Khitan large script in 920. This script looks superficially like Chinese writing, however, it bears little resemblance to Chinese writing, and the two were mutually unintelligible. Five years later, the arrival of a Uyghur delegation led Abaoji to order his younger brother, Yelü Diela, to develop a new script on more syllabic principles. Unlike the Japanese and Koreans, the Khitans managed to adopt the cultural and <b>administrative</b> <b>tool</b> of writing without the baggage of Chinese culture and grammar that came with the wholesale adoption of Chinese characters.|$|E
5000|$|While all {{enjoyed a}} {{relatively}} institutionalized relationship {{with regards to}} the law and the governing bureaucracy, the main separation lay {{in the fact that the}} first two social castes held a vested interest in the tributary system, while the landless peasant did not. This led to a rapid decline in tributary populations, as these individuals would evade tax collectors and the official tax rolls. Therefore, to be perceived as Indian, or as truly indigenous, was not simply a legal and <b>administrative</b> <b>tool,</b> but rather a facet of everyday practices. [...] In fact, indigenous tribes began to advocate for a “hybrid tributary-citizenship status,” which was firmly entrenched with land holdings; in other words, to hold land meant obtaining some variant of official citizenship.|$|E
50|$|A {{cylinder}} seal {{is a small}} round cylinder, typically about one inch in length, engraved with written characters or figurative scenes or both, used in ancient times to roll an impression onto a two-dimensional surface, generally wet clay. Cylinder seals were invented around 3500 BC in the Near East, at the contemporary sites of Susa in south-western Iran and Uruk in southern Mesopotamia. They {{are linked to the}} invention of the latter’s cuneiform writing on clay tablets. They were used as an <b>administrative</b> <b>tool,</b> a form of signature, as well as jewelry and as magical amulets; later versions would employ notations with Mesopotamian cuneiform. In later periods, they were used to notarize or attest to multiple impressions of clay documents. Graves and other sites housing precious items such as gold, silver, beads, and gemstones often included one or two {{cylinder seal}}s, as honorific grave goods.|$|E

50|$|Ram Bhagat {{points out}} that a {{demographic}} census {{is an exercise in}} the classification of a population and it is inherently constrained. An example of this is that the questions asked require non-overlapping responses, and both the questions and the lists of response options are guided by preconceptions resulting from political desires or needs. The political forces may emanate from within the government machine or from interest groups that seek recognition and self-advantage. The questions and available responses, as well as the statistical and logistical methods, change over time, and the same can be true of geographical boundaries and of population identities, such as race and nationalities. However, as well as being an <b>administrative</b> <b>tool,</b> a series of censuses can act as a coalescent of the population or at least of parts of it, causing various groups within the whole to form identities in space and over time. The ability of people to classify themselves can both reinforce and create classifications with which they identify.|$|E
