500|$|The label {{had also}} been known for {{carrying}} out the management concept of [...] "condominium". Originally conceived and penned by Cowell, it gave artists authority and responsibility over their recorded material independently, {{as well as the}} ability to assign the master tapes over to the label for distribution. Strata-East artists had more control over their recordings than major labels at the time had offered. Music journalist Kevin Moist later wrote of the label's [...] "condominium" [...] concept, [...] "The idea was to try and develop an independent cultural space outside of the mainstream that could function self-sufficiently and be genuinely participatory for its members. The goal was to live in an engaged way where art, society, spirituality, and politics could <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>together</b> holistically in an integrated existence. That (sub)cultural renewal is embodied in the kind of music midwifed by Strata-East." [...] The label's philosophy for artist management and recording ethic worked to the advantage of artists such as Gil Scott-Heron and Brian Jackson. Scott-Heron and Jackson were able to release more aesthetically personalized recordings for Strata-East than most mainstream labels would allow.|$|E

500|$|Tokyo Mew Mew was {{generally}} well received by reviewers, who {{described it as}} cute and entertaining. Though AnimeFringe Patrick King notes {{that it is not}} a very intellectual series and that it avoids complex plot points, he lauded it as engrossing [...] "brain candy" [...] and an [...] "endearing action-romance" [...] that has no [...] "delusions of grandeur". Critics praised the artwork in both Tokyo Mew Mew and the sequel Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode. Ikumi's [...] "free flowing" [...] style and character designs were seen as a perfect fit for the series. Criticism of Ikumi's art focused on images which regularly spilled out of panel borders and speech bubbles with ambiguous speakers.

Big eyes, cat ears, fuzzy tails, and short skirts <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>together</b> in a cuteness combo that's hard to resist." [...] According to Carlo Santos of Anime News Network, [...] "Mia Ikumi's artwork is perfectly suited to the story, and it is not even all that wispy and frilly compared to other shōjo material. Like many budding manga artist, Ikumi's greatest strength is in carefully posed character portraits, and her prolific use of tones creates unique effects while also sidestepping the challenge of backgrounds." [...] Conversely, in writing for , Shaenon Garrity criticizes the series, calling it [...] "uninspired", [...] "insipid" [...] and [...] "creative bankrupt" [...] and feeling it was [...] "clearly designed by its publisher to ride the magical girl tsunami for all it was worth: the creators' marginal notes are filled with references to big book signings, photo shoots, and models hired to dress as the scantily clad preteen heroines." [...] She also remarks that the series makes poor use of its endangered species theme, while still having a [...] "preachy environmental theme".|$|E

2500|$|Akinetopsia is an {{intriguing}} condition {{brought about by}} damage to the Extrastriate cortex MT+ that renders humans and monkeys unable to perceive motion, seeing {{the world in a}} series of static [...] "frames" [...] instead and indicates {{that there might be a}} [...] "motion centre" [...] in the brain. Of course, such data can only indicate that this area is at least necessary to motion perception, not that it is sufficient; however, other evidence has shown the importance of this area to primate motion perception. Specifically, physiological, neuroimaging, perceptual, electrical- and transcranial magnetic stimulation evidence (Table 1) <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>together</b> on the area V5/hMT+. Converging evidence of this type is supportive of a module for motion processing. However, this view is likely to be incomplete: other areas are involved with motion perception, including V1, V2 and V3a [...] and areas surrounding V5/hMT+ (Table 2). A recent fMRI study put the number of motion areas at twenty-one. [...] Clearly, this constitutes a stream of diverse anatomical areas. The extent to which this is ‘pure’ is in question: with Akinetopsia come severe difficulties in obtaining structure from motion. V5/hMT+ has since been implicated in this function as well as determining depth. Thus the current evidence suggests that motion processing occurs in a modular stream, although with a role in form and depth perception at higher levels.|$|E
