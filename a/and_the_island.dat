5|$|Beese {{introduced}} Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Island</b> head {{shared his}} enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in Winehouse {{had started to}} build to include representatives of EMI and Virgin starting to make moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the reason behind the excitement, over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time, was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.|$|E
50|$|Saanich was {{a provincial}} electoral {{district}} in the Canadian province of British Columbia. It made its first appearance in the election of 1903 and its last {{in the general election}} of 1963 after which it was combined with parts of <b>the</b> former Nanaimo <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Islands</b> riding to form Saanich <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Islands.</b> <b>The</b> same area is currently represented by Saanich North <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>and</b> Saanich South.|$|R
50|$|In 1933 {{there was}} a Cowichan-Newcastle riding, while in 1937 the riding of Newcastle (southern and upland of {{metropolitan}} Nanaimo <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Gulf <b>Islands</b> to <b>the</b> southeast) appeared in the 1916 election, as did a new riding called <b>The</b> <b>Islands</b> which lasted until the 1937 election.

5|$|Beyond is the Mediterranean Sea <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Cyprus. Here, a {{transition}} in hue is made, from the browns that {{prevail in the}} lower half of the painting to the aquas that saturate the upper half. The Nile River meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the Nile Delta. South of Cyprus is the Sinai Peninsula, which forms a land bridge between Africa and Southwest Asia. The Red Sea lies beyond, eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{served in}} the active duty {{squadron}} early in their careers, and participated in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12.

They were reduced to harbor defense ships by the outbreak of World War I, and they spent the war in Venice. The ships were discarded shortly {{after the end of the}} war, both having been stricken in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{believed}} {{it was very important}} to assimilate the new Swedish territories of Scania, Blekinge, Halland, in southern Sweden; Bohuslän in western Sweden and Jämtland, in northern Sweden, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Gotland. Some assimilation policies included: the ban of all books written in Danish or Norwegian, thus breaking the promise made at the Treaty of Roskilde; the use of Swedish language in the conduct of sermons; and all new priests and teachers having to come from Sweden.|$|E

5|$|Drosera anglica, {{commonly}} known as the English sundew or great sundew, is a carnivorous plant species belonging to the sundew family Droseraceae. It is a temperate species with a generally circumboreal range, although it does occur as far south as Japan, southern Europe, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Kauai in Hawaii, where it grows as a subtropical sundew. It is thought to originate from an amphidiploid hybrid of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis, meaning that a sterile hybrid between these two species doubled its chromosomes to produce fertile progeny which stabilized into the current D. anglica.|$|E
5|$|Haddam Island State Park {{is home to}} a {{large number}} of bird species, {{especially}} during annual migrations, which make it suitable for birdwatching. Bird-banding and other research activities have taken place on the island. Other recommended activities are boating and fishing. Access via boat is available from the Haddam Meadows State Park boat launch, a half mile south of Haddam Island. The northern side of the island has a beach that is fragile and cannot support heavy visitation, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> has a significant amount of poison ivy.|$|E
5|$|In September 1915, the Central Powers {{were joined}} by Bulgaria, and the Serbian Army soon faced an {{overwhelming}} Austro-Hungarian, German and Bulgarian ground invasion.

5|$|Jersey Royal {{potatoes}} are the local {{variety of new}} potato, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> {{is famous for its}} early crop of Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing côtils (steeply sloping fields).

They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter or when not as fresh fried in butter.|$|E

5|$|Kīlauea's {{high state}} of {{activity}} {{has a major}} impact on its mountainside ecology, where plant growth is often interrupted by fresh tephra and drifting volcanic sulfur dioxide, producing acid rains particularly in a barren area south of its southwestern rift zone known as the Kaʻū Desert. Nonetheless, wildlife flourishes where left undisturbed elsewhere on the volcano and is highly endemic thanks to Kīlauea's (<b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Hawaii's) isolation from the nearest landmass. Historically, the five volcanoes on the island were considered sacred by the Hawaiian people, and in Hawaiian mythology Kīlauea's Halemaumau Crater served as the body and home of Pele, goddess of fire, lightning, wind, and volcanoes. William Ellis, a missionary from England, gave the first modern account of Kīlauea and spent two weeks traveling along the volcano; since its foundation by Thomas Jaggar in 1912, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, located on the rim of Kīlauea caldera, has served as the principal investigative and scientific body on the volcano <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> in general. In 1916, a bill forming the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson; since then, the park has become a World Heritage Site and a major tourist destination, attracting roughly 2.6 million people annually.|$|E

Under overall {{operational}} command of Brigadier Joseph (Charles) Haydon who directed the operation from HMS Kenya, Nos. 5 and 6 Troops under Major Jack Churchill landed on Maaloy while Durnford-Slater led Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 Troops ashore on Vaagso. In addition to the troops from No. 3 Commando, there were two troops from No. 2 Commando acting as the floating reserve.|$|E
5|$|Sphenodon punctatus {{naturally}} {{occurs on}} 29 islands, and its population {{is estimated to}} be over 60,000individuals.

The carrying capacity of Moutohora is estimated at 8,500 individuals, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> could allow public viewing of wild tuatara. In 2003, 60 northern tuatara were introduced to Tiritiri Matangi Island from Middle Island in the Mercury group. They are occasionally seen sunbathing by visitors to the island.|$|E
