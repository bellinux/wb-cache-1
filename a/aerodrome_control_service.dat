40|$|The {{issue of}} {{application}} of Air Traffic Control (ATC) competence reference models as {{a mean of}} air navigation services provider’s charge optimization is described in the article, and this issue is interpretated as an optimization task. The data relating to the significant growth of aviation traffic, especially using the airspace of Ukraine, given by authors, and the statement of fact that Air Traffic Management (ATM) system’s technical component reliability increasement takes place {{on the basis of}} practically invariable psychophysiological abilities of aviation controller, make the substantiation of ANSP provision with the most trained ATC controllers for the work on the working places of ATC Unit actual. The ‘mechanism’ of ATC controllers competence reference model creation is defined step-by step. There is an example of candidate’s for the working place competence quantitative individual model forming as a common criteria of competence, which, in its turn, is the compressed format of all parameters of its working activity, received at the stage of control. The approach, according to which the individual parameters of graduating student’s output model’s professional characteristics, which he received after the examination of his work as Tower controller (ATM Unit of <b>aerodrome</b> <b>control</b> <b>service),</b> approach controller or area control service controller, are compared with the predetermined specialist’s competence reference model, relating to the special working place in ATM system, is supposed here. Notably, the conception, relating to the correspondence of the graduating student’s competence output level to the defined reference model of ATC controller, relating to the special working place of ATM Unit, is realised. </p...|$|E

40|$|Various {{countries}} {{today are}} actively seeking {{concept of the}} future complex equipment to provide information support for the <b>control</b> and dispatch <b>services</b> of regional airports and small aircraft aerodromes. This {{is due to the}} general trend towards the air traffic intensification, especially that of small aircrafts, as well for economic reasons to reduce the cost of info-dispatching system of regional airports compared with the large airports. Radars for different-purpose are the most universal and all-weather information sensors for <b>aerodrome</b> <b>control</b> <b>services.</b> For regional airports where air traffic is low, the use of information and dispatching systems based on radars, air-field surveillance radars, and approach radars is unreasonably expensive. For the last few years, optoelectronic information systems for info-dispatching systems of regional airports have been developing. When using the optoelectronic information systems at the regional aerodromes in our country there are problems of ensuring the full operation of the airport systems in adverse weather conditions (snow, rain, fog) and a lack of the independent control of the aircraft flight in the airport control zone. Development of new technologies in radar enabled us to design a highly informative radarand-optical complex to accept the challenges of the all-weather information sensor in control and dispatching system of regional airports. This complex, {{for the first time in}} the aerodrome radars, uses two branches of the ultra-wideband signal technology together, namely: very short pulse radar (VSPR) technology and that of the wideband inter-pulse signals and integration with optoelectronic systems. Integration of passive optical-electronic and radar channels allowed us to raise the accuracy of determining the angular coordinates at small ranges, where they are most important. However, since so far there were no complexes, such as “D-RLS”, the existing regulatory documents do not reflect their functions and capabilities and, therefore, there is a need to revise existing, or introduce new regulatory documents to ensure air traffic <b>control</b> in regional <b>aerodromes.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{air traffic}} control system is a vast network of people and {{necessary}} navigational equipment that ensures the safe operation of commercial and private aircraft throughout the world. Air traffic controller service is responsible for area, approach and <b>aerodrome</b> <b>control.</b> Aircraft fatal accident data for commercial jet airplanes between 1959 and 2008 show that 36 % of the accidents happen in the final approach and landing phase, possibly due to mechanical failure or human error resulting from poor communication between the pilot and {{air traffic control}}ler. This paper presents an integration of a radar system with a GPS-based Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) for approach control separation between all instrument flight rules (IFR) flights and between IFR flights and visual flight rules (VFR) flights operated as controlled flights. The integration is simulated using MATLAB. Results of the simulation show that aircraft separation is easier and safer than relying only on an air traffic controller. We note, however, that the service of air traffic controllers is still required for successful <b>aerodrome</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R

Two feedback loops are considered to influence the controllers monitoring behavior: The accessibility of the information of the “far-view” and controller strategies. The results show that both variables have a crucial influence on how often the controller updates the information of one airport. This implies that monitoring performance depends on system design and behavioral strategies. These dependencies {{can be applied to}} the design of novel ATC-workplaces...|$|R
