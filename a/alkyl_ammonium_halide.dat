40|$|Far-infrared {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} applied to the study of liquid phase molecular dynamics and interactions. The absorption and dispersion spectra of solutions of acetonitrile in carbon tetrachloride, across a range of temperatures and concentrations, have been obtained. These spectra have bean interpreted with the parameters obtained from a model developed from a generalised Langsvin equation of motion which includes intermolecular torque terms. The results obtained from the model analysis have been applied in an investigation of the non-reorientational contributions to the Raman and infrared bands arising from the and v(^ 1) and v(_ 3) modes. This study has shown that contrary to the assumptions commonly made, these contributions are not equal and some possible explanations for the discrepancies are given. A number of internal field theories are discussed and have been applied to the acetonitrile systems. The interpretation of the results of this analysis in terms of a simple model suggest that there is a preferred i. e. non-random orientation of the acetonitrile molecules in solution. A study of some tertiary <b>alkyl</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>halide</b> solutions has revealed that there is a series of systems which separate into two liquid phases.

40|$|Polymer layered {{silicate}} nanocomposites (PLSN) {{have attracted}} great interest because they exhibit remarkable improvements in materials properties relative to pristine polymers. Successful {{formation of a}} PLSN is critically dependent on generation of very high interfacial area in the composite. This is accomplished when the stacks of silicate platelets (tactoids) split into discrete platelets. The latter phenomenon is known as exfoliation and is strongly influenced by interfacial chemistry (i. e. structure and properties of the interface or interphase) associated with the edge and basal surfaces of the silicate platelets, chemical modification (usually with quaternary <b>alkyl</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>halides)</b> of the latter and the resulting effect on interactions between the platelets themselves and polymer chains. Interactions between sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT) /organically modified montmorillonite (o-MMT) {{and a variety of}} probes, some of which are intended to model the structures present in the components of a polyurethane (PU), epoxy resin and polystyrene system (PS), have been studied. The adsorption process was characterised using flow microcalorimetry (FMC) in conjuncqon with diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and wide angle x-ray scattering (). Adsorption of hydrogen bondable groups, such as alcohol, ether, amine probes, onto Na-MMT was dominated by the hydrogen bonding interactions with hydrated Na+ ions and with the hydroxyl groups present at the platelet edges. Moreover, stronger interactions with hydrated Na+ ions led to greater retention of the probes after the desorption process. When the Na-MMT was moisturized at ambient atmosphere, hydrogen bondable probes showed a reversible adsorption. In contrast, chemical adsorption (reaction) dominated the adsorption of the isocyanate probe onto Na-MMT; the latter reacted either with the platelet edge hydroxyl groups forming a urethane linkage or with pre-adsorbed ambient water molecules adsorbed onto Na-MMT ultimately forming a physically adsorbed urea. In the case of o-MMTs, when only the platelet edge hydroxyl groups were available, hydrogen bondable probes showed a reversible adsorption. Reactions between reactive probes, including isocyanate and epoxide probes, and surfactant functional groups (OH and COOH groups) are affected by the gallery structures, such as the arrangement of surfactant within the galleries and level of surfactant intercalated. Adsorption of aromatic probes, including styrene, ethylbenzene and polystyrene, was dominated by the relatively weak dispersive interactions with the basal surfaces of o-MMT, and was significantly affected by the gallery structures ofo-MMT (surfactant level and surfactant structure).

40|$|An {{improved}} {{chemical modification}} {{has been developed}} to enhance the dispersion of layered silicate particles {{in the formulation of}} a polymer/silicate nanocomposite material. The modification involves, among other things, the co-exchange of an <b>alkyl</b> <b>ammonium</b> ion and a monoprotonated diamine with interlayer cations of the silicate. The net overall effects of the improved chemical modification are to improve processability of the nanocomposite and maximize the benefits of dispersing the silicate particles into the polymer. Some background discussion is necessary to give meaning to a description of this development. Polymer/silicate nanocomposites are also denoted polymer/clay composites because the silicate particles in them are typically derived from clay particles. Particles of clay comprise layers of silicate platelets separated by gaps called "galleries. " The platelet thickness is 1 nm. The length varies from 30 nm to 1 m, depending on the silicate. In order to fully realize the benefits of polymer/silicate nanocomposites, it is necessary to ensure that the platelets become dispersed in the polymer matrices. Proper dispersion can impart physical and chemical properties that make nanocomposites attractive for a variety of applications. In order to achieve nanometer-level dispersion of a layered silicate into a polymer matrix, it is typically necessary to modify the interlayer silicate surfaces by attaching organic functional groups. This modification can be achieved easily by ion exchange between the interlayer metal cations found naturally in the silicate and protonated organic cations - typically protonated amines. Long-chain <b>alkyl</b> <b>ammonium</b> ions are commonly chosen as the ion-exchange materials because they effectively lower the surface energies of the silicates and ease the incorporation of organic monomers or polymers into the silicate galleries. This completes the background discussion. In the present improved modification of the interlayer silicate surfaces, the co-ion exchange strengthens the polymer/silicate interface and ensures irreversible separation of the silicate layers. One way in which it does this is to essentially tether one amine of each diamine molecule to a silicate surface, leaving the second amine free for reaction with monomers during the synthesis of a polymer. In addition, the incorporation of <b>alkyl</b> <b>ammonium</b> ions into the galleries at low concentration helps to keep low the melt viscosity of the oligomer formed during synthesis of the polymer and associated processing - a consideration that is particularly important {{in the case of a}} highly cross-linked, thermosetting polymer. Because of the chemical bonding between the surface-modifying amines and the monomers, even when the <b>alkyl</b> <b>ammonium</b> ions become degraded at high processing temperature, the silicate layers do not aggregate and, hence, nanometer-level dispersion is maintained...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with an experimental study of clay intercalation by organic dye molecule which is crucial for the successful development of a stable clay-dye pigment with combined advantages of organic dye and inorganic clay. Clay-dye pigments were prepared by two different methods. Two different organic dyes were used with unmodified clay and modified clay to study the intercalation. Characteristics of clay-dye pigment have been investigated using X-Ray Diffraction, Thermo-gravimetric Analysis and Transmission Electron Microscopy. In this thesis it is shown that the absorption of cationic dye by unmodified clay in aqueous medium mainly {{takes place in the}} interlayer clay surface. More likely the dye molecules with aromatic quaternary ammonium cation intercalate the clay layer and strongly interacts with the clay interlayer oxygen plane, where solvent dye (which is hydrophobic in nature) adsorption by unmodified clay mainly takes place on outer surface of the clay. Dye molecules are weakly interacted with outer surface oxygen plane by hydrogen bonding or Vander Waals forces. Modified clay enabled the solvent dye to intercalate inside the clay interlayer surface with the suitable non-aqueous medium (because of its expanded structure). The modified clay suspension in the selected non-aqueous medium shows only partial desorption of <b>alkyl</b> <b>ammonium</b> molecule from the clay layer with the presence of both cationic dye and solvent dye. Therefore the penetrated dye molecules must have weakly interacted with the interlayer oxygen plane as well as the remaining <b>alkyl</b> <b>ammonium</b> molecule present inside the clay layer. It is believed that the thermal and UV stability of organic dye can only be facilitated by a specific interaction (ƒà-interactions) between aromatic <b>alkyl</b> <b>ammonium</b> cation of organic dye molecule and the interlayer oxygen plane of clay minerals. This interaction possibly enables the high thermal energy or the energy of the UV radiation to transmit immediately into the clay layer. Therefore organic dye molecules are protected from high energy loading and hence thermal and UV stability are improved...|$|R
