60|$|This answer, {{simple as}} it was, nearly overcame our young man again. Socrates and Dido had been the slaves of Bridget, when he left home; {{a part of the}} estate she had {{received}} from her grandmother. They dwelt in the house with her, and uniformly called her mistress. Mark knew them both very well, as a matter of course; and Dido, with the archness of a favourite domestic, was often in the habit of calling him her 'young master.' A flood of expectations, conjectures and apprehensions came over our hero, and he refrained from putting any questions immediately, out of pure astonishment. He was almost <b>afraid</b> indeed <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> any.|$|R

25|$|The {{clinical}} study Human Sexual Response {{was published by}} Masters and Johnson in 1966, and the topic suddenly became more commonplace in America. The 1969 book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were <b>Afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>Ask)</b> by psychiatrist David Reuben was a more popular attempt at answering the public's curiosity regarding such matters. Then in 1972 appeared The Joy of Sex by Alex Comfort, reflecting an even more candid perception of love-making. By this time, the recreational or 'fun' aspects of sexual behavior were being discussed more openly than ever before, and this more 'enlightened' outlook resulted {{not just from the}} publication of such new books as these, but from a more pervasive sexual revolution that had already been well underway for some time.|$|E
25|$|HBO's first {{successful}} documentary aired in 1979, the six-part series Time Was, which featured host Dick Cavett being inserted into seminal events occurring between the 1920s and the 1970s. 1981's She's Nobody's Baby, produced by Ms. magazine, was another well-known documentary tracing the {{evolution in the}} societal role of American women during the 20th Century; the special earned HBO the first Peabody Award won by a pay television service. Since then, the network has brought home numerous Peabody Awards for its documentary films. HBO had also broadcast informational documentaries produced in partnership with Consumer Reports starting in 1980, focusing on subjects from product safety to finance to health. One such documentary, AIDS: Everything You and Your Family Need to Know…But Were <b>Afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>Ask,</b> which aired in 1987 {{at the height of}} the AIDS epidemic in the U.S., provided factual information on AIDS and HIV and was hosted by then-Surgeon General C.

Still {{possessed by}} the hope entity, Nicole appears to retain her sense of self, stating {{she is able to}} hear the hope in her parents' hearts as well as the crowd around them. Nicole goes on to say she can sense an {{emptiness}} in Larfleeze and tells him that his parents are still alive and they miss him. She also tells Jordan that he is <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> hope and <b>asks</b> him why. Before Hal can answer, the group is interrupted by the arrival of Barry Allen.|$|R

Her family, I have always heard, was very good on both sides; she is poor, poor even to poverty, I fear now." [...] Here Pris. paused; there was a tremor in her voice, even, and I detected tears starting to her eyes. [...] "Poor Dus!" [...] she continued--"she had much to support, {{in the way of}} poverty, even while at school; where she was, indeed, as a dependent, rather than as a boarder; but no one among us all, could presume to offer her favors.

500|$|... “Captain Pissgums and His Pervert Pirates” by S. Clay Wilson in Zap Comix #3 (1968) {{featured}} explicit sexual {{homosexual acts}} and {{was instrumental in}} making other underground cartoonists approach taboo subjects. However, gay characters rarely featured in underground comics from 1968 to 1975, {{and when they did}} they were usually lisping caricatures and comic transvestites. An installment of [...] "Harold Hedd" [...] by Rand Holmes in 1971 stands out for attacking the homophobia of David Reuben’s sex manual Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were <b>Afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>Ask),</b> featuring explicit mutual gay sex acts, and promoting gay liberation.|$|E
500|$|Alice {{developed}} {{a friendship with}} the theologian David Friedrich Strauss. He was a controversial figure at the time; in 1835, he published The Life of Jesus, which argued that the Bible could not be literally interpreted as God's word, a view akin to heresy in orthodox circles. Alice's view was similar to Strauss's, and she believed that contemporary Victorian society was presenting God {{in a way that}} would be [...] "unrecognisable to early Christians". Strauss also offered Alice an intellectual companionship that her husband was not equipped to provide, and he was regularly invited to the New Palace to read to Alice privately. The friendship flourished; Strauss was introduced to Alice's sister Victoria and her brother-in-law Frederick, and he was invited by them to Berlin. In 1870, Strauss wanted to dedicate his new work Lectures on Voltaire to Alice, but he was too <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> her; she spared him the need by asking him to dedicate them to her. However, Alice's relationship with Strauss angered Empress Augusta, who labelled Alice a [...] "complete atheist" [...] after hearing about his promotion.|$|E
500|$|After Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were <b>Afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>Ask),</b> Wilder {{began working}} on a script he called Young Frankenstein. After he wrote a two-page scenario, he called Mel Brooks, who {{told him that it}} seemed like a [...] "cute" [...] idea, but showed little interest. A few months later, Wilder {{received}} a call from his agent, Mike Medavoy, who asked if he had anything where he could include Peter Boyle and Marty Feldman, his two new clients. Having just seen Feldman on television, Wilder was inspired to write a scene that takes place at Transylvania Station, where Igor and Frederick meet for the first time. The scene was later included in the film almost verbatim. Medavoy liked the idea and called Brooks, asking him to direct. Brooks was not convinced, but having spent four years working on two box-office failures, he decided to accept. While working on the Young Frankenstein script, Wilder was offered the part of the Fox in the musical film adaptation of Saint Exupéry's classic book, The Little Prince. When filming was about to begin in London, Wilder received an urgent call from [...] Brooks, who was filming Blazing Saddles, offering Wilder the role of the [...] "Waco Kid" [...] after Dan Dailey dropped out at the last minute, while Gig Young became too ill to continue. Wilder shot his scenes for Blazing Saddles and immediately afterwards filmed The Little Prince.|$|E

40|$|I like a {{good story}} well told. That is the reason I am {{sometimes}} forced to tell them myself. —Mark Twain What springs to mind {{when you hear the}} word “storytelling”? For most of us, it conjures up images of children gathered in front of a rocking chair, rapt with attention as an elder narrates a fairy tale. Unencumbered by the inhibitions of older years, they aren’t <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> interrupt and <b>ask</b> for details <b>to</b> satisfy their cu-riosity, or clamor for more when the story ends.

One tool {{that can be used to}} facilitate the teaching-learning process is by creating a distance learning system. Assignment often make subject matter is not resolved in a single class meeting. The next meeting is no longer discuss the subject matter before, but that students can not answer questions about the material or tasks that are less understood when the lesson is in progress, due to limited school hours. Through making this information system, students need not be <b>afraid</b> anymore <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the teacher said about the subject matter or task that is less understood because it can make questions and answers through discussion forums. In addition there are several advantages gained by making this information system include: subject matter can be explained in more detail again so that students can master the subject matter well and maximize the learning process. But in making use of information systems distance learning is necessary also to cooperation between the students with subjects that teachers and students with a student's own.
