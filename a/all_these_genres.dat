5000|$|The band's {{material}} {{is based on}} Russian paganism and mythology, and the melodies are drawn from indigenous Russian folk music, but the arrangements and riffs are drawn from power metal, black metal and symphonic metal, consisting of simplistic power chords under intricate [...] "shredding" [...] lead guitar (characteristic of power metal), male low-end shrieks (found in black metal) and soaring female operatic vocals (as found in symphonic metal).

It even included Christmas carol recordings by the oddly named Butlin Choral Society. It was also very rarely a location for recorded jazz concerts Heath 1958 and 1963 and even Mantovani.

50|$|Although {{the number}} of amateurs {{remained}} high between the wars their ability to match their professional counterparts gradually receded. After the Second World War it became rare for any more than four or five amateurs {{to take part in}} any given year. The last amateur rider to win the race is Marcus Armytage, who (as of 2016) set the still-standing course record of 8:47.8, when winning on Mr Frisk in 1990. By the 21st century however, openings for amateur riders had become very rare with some years passing with no amateur riders at all taking part. Those that do in the modern era are most usually talented young riders who are often close to turning professional. In the past, such amateur riders would have been joined by army officers, such as David Campbell who won in 1896, and sporting aristocrats, farmers or local huntsmen and point to point riders, who usually opted to ride their own mounts. But <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>genres</b> of rider have faded out {{in the last quarter of}} a century with no riders of military rank or aristocratic title having taken a mount since 1982.|$|E

5000|$|Extreme metal is a loosely defined {{umbrella}} {{term for}} a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a [...] "cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. [...] With the exception of doom metal, <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> <b>genres</b> are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore.

Adventure fiction takes the setting and premise of <b>these</b> other <b>genres,</b> but the fast-paced plot of an adventure focuses on the actions of the hero within the setting.

50|$|Tanzania, an African country, has {{a history}} of European colonization. There has been a long-standing debate in {{regarding}} the implicit dynamics of power when a colonized or oppressed culture adopting certain cultural forms (music styles, fashion, etc.) of the colonizers or the oppressors. Is hip-hop in Tanzania mimicry and imitation of American hip-hop, which would imply an American cultural hegemony? Or are artists borrowing some elements of American hip-hop that resonate with them, among a variety of other (for example Tanzanian, Congolese, Japanese, or Cuban) cultural influences and then creating something entirely new, entirely their own? Are these always mutually exclusive? Alex Perullo, writer and professor at Bryant College in Rhode Island, says this: say all this music that is coming from the West such as hip-hop is destroying local cultures and local ideas, and local musical trends. And to some extent, there {{is a little bit of}} truth in that, although I would hesitate to say that cultural imperialism is actually happening...There are a lot of artists in Tanzania who do dress exactly like the people that they see from the United States. They wear the FUBU clothing, they wear the baggy pants, they wear the New York Yankees hats...But the problem with that is this is very early in the pop music....They sang in English, and sang about American issues. But now we have artists singing in Swahili, and they sing about Swahili issues, about Tanzanian issues, about issues that are very much identified with their country...So I think as far as Tanzanian identity is concerned, yes, there are certain things that they're going to keep borrowing from American culture or European culture, or other African cultures, but this doesn't mean that there's going to be assorted eradication of local trends...the main genres are still there. There not disappearing. There's room enough for <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>genres</b> to grow, and they each occupy different areas.|$|E

40|$|The {{figure of}} the mala or “bad woman” is present in much of Ancient Greek and Latin literature. In this context, being a mala means being a woman who participates in the process where an older woman advises a younger woman about how to profit from men who will pay to sleep with her. In this paper, I define the {{characteristics}} of the mala and document {{the ways in which the}} language of power and control is used with malae in Plautus’ Casina; the elegies of Propertius, Tibullus, and Ovid; and Lucian’s Dialogues of the Courtesans. The characteristics of the mala that are present in <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> <b>genres</b> highlight the fact that this character is an important vehicle for expressing cultural anxieties surrounding women.

2500|$|The Grateful Dead's {{early music}} (in the mid-1960s) {{was part of}} the process of {{establishing}} what [...] "psychedelic music" [...] was, but theirs was essentially a [...] "street party" [...] form of it.

The Dead were not inclined to fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or country & western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> <b>genres</b> and, more frequently, melding several of them. It was doubtless with this in mind that Bill Graham said of the Grateful Dead, [...] "They're not the best at what they do, they're the only ones that do what they do."

50|$|This {{was also}} {{the period in which}} {{concepts}} of formal structure developed which were attentive to proportion, texture, and architectural effect. Composers of the period alternated florid and discant organum (more note-against-note, as opposed to the succession of many-note melismas against long-held notes found in the florid type), and created several new musical forms: clausulae, which were melismatic sections of organa extracted and fitted with new words and further musical elaboration; conductus, which was a song for one or more voices to be sung rhythmically, most likely in a procession of some sort; and tropes, which were additions of new words and sometimes new music to sections of older chant. <b>All</b> of <b>these</b> <b>genres</b> save one were based upon chant; that is, one of the voices, (usually three, though sometimes four) nearly always the lowest (the tenor at this point) sang a chant melody, though with freely composed note-lengths, over which the other voices sang organum. The exception to this method was the conductus, a two-voice composition that was freely composed in its entirety.|$|R
