Like many other herding dog breeds, the Cattle Dog has an active and fertile mind and if it is not given jobs to do it will find its own activities. It will <b>appreciate</b> <b>a</b> walk around the neighbourhood, but it needs structured activities that engage and challenge it, and regular interaction with its owner. While individual dogs have their own personalities and abilities, as a breed the Australian Cattle Dog is suited to any activity that calls for athleticism, intelligence, and endurance.|$|E

Lowe posted a letter of outrage and threatened to resign his position. No one came to his support, and Comstock remained unyielding. On 8 April 1863, Lowe left the military service {{and returned to the}} private sector. Direction of the Balloon Corps defaulted to the Allen brothers, but they were not as competent as Lowe.

For a long time, {{the vast majority of the}} mail received was from the top few fanatical SFB players, who constantly campaigned for new rules, rules fixes, and rules changes. This became a source of discontent for most of the rest of the players, who did not <b>appreciate</b> <b>a</b> game that changed every few months, and needed a sheaf of notes along with the voluminous rules. However, it was generally believed nearly impossible to repair the damage by properly re-writing and re-integrating such a large and complex system into a new edition before doomsday, especially without bringing the product line to a halt while only new versions of old products were released.|$|E

Some groups practice raising the baby toward the sky three times to introduce them to heaven and Earth. Libations are also poured and live sacrifices of chickens or goats are made to ensure good health and protect the child from evil. The father or an elder will call out the child's name for the guests to repeat aloud to formally welcome the child into the community. After the naming concludes, friends and relatives give gifts to the family, and feasting and dancing follows.|$|E

Wyman elaborated that he felt fans [...] "would really <b>appreciate</b> <b>a</b> mythology in two places", and showing both universes [...] "just presented itself in such a natural organic way to evolution in our storytelling". Fox however was initially worried about the premise's sustainability, and that an episode without Peter or Walter [...] "wouldn't feel like our show anymore," [...] to which Pinkner responded that [...] "not unlike a show like Lost, Fringe has to constantly evolve, to move and grow and go forward, otherwise we'll get bored, the cast will get bored, the audience will get bored". After the first three episodes, both Fox and Warner Bros. became more favorable to the storyline.|$|E
500|$|After graduating, Hedlund {{signed with}} the Trenton Titans of the East Coast Hockey League for the final games of the 2001–02 season. He played in two games as a rookie and did not record a stat during the regular season, but in six playoff games he spent six minutes in the penalty box.

In Binghamton, he played in 59 games scoring one goal and adding seven assists.

His previous goal was a game-winning shot against Syracuse. He ended the 2003–04 season with four goals and 19 assists in 80 games. Before the 2004–05 season, Hedlund spent time in training camp with the Ottawa Senators before he was reassigned to Binghamton. The NHL season would eventually be locked out which saw players such as goaltender Dominik Hašek join the AHL. When Hasek began working out with Binghamton, Hedlund commented, [...] "He's just one of the guys when he's here, he just wants to put in his time and get some good work in, and make sure he's ready to go, so you just got to <b>appreciate</b> <b>a</b> guy like that being here and doing that kind of work, so its pretty fun." [...] A season preview produced by the website Hockey's Future commented about Hedlund saying that, [...] "A fan-favorite, Hedlund gives it everything he has despite limited talent."

Following the season, he and Philadelphia Phantoms player Ben Stafford were named the AHL's Men of the Year. During the season he played in 75 games, scoring two goals with 13 assists.

2500|$|In 54 BC Cicero {{wrote that}} he [...] "did not fancy" [...] there were any musically educated people on the British isle.Independent of the {{validity}} of Cicero's remark, the situation was different for the Gallic regions. By the time of Augustus, musical education had widely gained ground in Gaul, as Iulius Sacrovir used the erudite Gauls as a decoy, after Sacrovir and Iulius Florus had occupied the city of Augustodonum during the Gallic insurrection in 21 AD. The Gauls took great pride in their musical culture, which is shown by the remark of Gaius Iulius Vindex, the Gallic rebel and later senator under Claudius, who shortly before the arrival in Rome called emperor Nero a malus citharodeus ("bad cithara player") and reproached him with inscitia [...] artis ("ignorance of the arts").

2500|$|The {{reputation}} of the show as a springboard to fame meant that many aspiring stars were eager to join the new series. Doumanian was tasked with hiring a full cast and writing staff {{in less than three}} months, and NBC immediately cut the show's budget from the previous $1million per episode down to just $350,000. Doumanian faced resentment and sabotage from the remaining Michaels staff, particularly males who did not <b>appreciate</b> <b>a</b> woman believing she could take Michaels' place. The season was a disaster; ratings plummeted, and audiences failed to connect to the original cast's replacements, such as Charles Rocket and Ann Risley. Doumanian's fate was sealed when, during a sketch, Rocket said [...] "fuck" [...] on live television. After only ten months, Doumanian was dismissed. Although executives suggested that SNL be left to die, network chief Brandon Tartikoff wanted to keep the show on the air, believing that the concept was more important to the network than money. Tartikoff turned to Ebersol as his choice for the new producer. Ebersol previously had been fired by Silverman. Ebersol gained Michaels' approval in an attempt to avoid the same staff sabotage that had blighted Doumanian's tenure.|$|E
