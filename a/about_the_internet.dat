500|$|He {{cites the}} Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA) {{as an example}} of U.S. {{government}} action which cramps free speech. Godwin describes the subsequent attempts to defeat CDA. The Supreme Court of the United States held two sections to be unconstitutional and Godwin recounts how he became emotional over the decision. Throughout the book Godwin emphasizes that [...] "the remedy for the abuse of free speech is more speech". Cyber Rights puts forth the notion that [...] "virtual communities" [...] can be fostered on the Internet that serve the values of democracy, writing [...] "The decisions we make <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> don't affect just the Internet – they are answers to basic questions about the relationship each citizen has to the government and {{about the extent to which}} we trust one another with the full range of fundamental rights granted by the Constitution,".|$|E
500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't ask him <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet.</b> I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E

2500|$|Research on Internet {{infidelity}} is {{a relatively}} new field of interest. [...] It is difficult to classify any type of sexual interaction via the Internet as infidelity because it lacks the physical aspect. In their book, [...] "The Philosophy of Sex", Alan Soble and Nicholas Power speculate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet,</b> infidelity and culture, [...] "According to the dominant account in our culture, the paradigm case of what counts as sex is heterosexual intercourse, where a man and women engage in a particularly intimate form of physical contact, in which a penis penetrates a vagina. [...] This case is paradigmatic in that it organizes social judgments about which other activities count as sexual, and also connects to dominant views about what sex is normal, natural and good." ...|$|E

2500|$|Because anti-Shia {{attitudes are}} engrained {{from an early}} age, they are passed down from {{generation}} to generation. [...] This prejudice is found not only in textbooks (often characterizing the faith {{as a form of}} heresy worse than Christianity and Judaism), but also within the teachers in the classroom, and even in the university setting. [...] (Wahhabi) teachers frequently tell classrooms full of young Shia schoolchildren that they are heretics. Teachers who proclaim that Shiites are atheists and deserve death have faced no repercussions for their actions, barely even receiving punishment. [...] At a seminar <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet,</b> held in King Abdulaziz City of Science and Technology, professor Dr. Bader Hmood Albader explained how the internet was beneficial to society, {{but at the same time}} there were many Shia websites proclaiming to be Muslim websites, which needed to be stopped.|$|E
