40|$|An {{overview}} of knowledge engineering research, practice, theories, methodologies, and tools is presented, and parallels are drawn with analogous phenomena and activities in requirements engineering. Knowledgebased systems are distinguished from other advanced information systems by their reflective emphasis on meta-information processing about {{the basis of}} system operation. In terms of requirements elicitation this corresponds to an emphasis on maintaining an audit trail from requirements through design, implementation, use and maintenance, that supports continuing user involvement in system specification, design and evolution. Examples of knowledge elicitation methodologies and tools are given, and {{it is suggested that}} they all have some applicability in requirements elicitation for <b>advanced</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> development.

We have concluded that legal security could be achieved by the perfection of jurisdiction, of which the three major elements are time, precision and efficiency [4]. The final goal of an appropriately working juridical system is to find equilibrium between time and precision and this way to reach maximum efficiency. This paper will discuss in details the problems of the Hungarian juridical system, particularly those, which can be solved or supported by IT tools. Our research project will be demonstrated, in which after the analysis of laws and legal studies the knowledge mapping of this domain has been realized. Based on this, an ontology has been made and an expert system has been developed. Our paper also describes how an <b>advanced</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> can improve the efficiency of the juridical processes. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{examines}} channel performances of business-to-business electronic and traditional marketplaces for newsvendor problems under revenue-sharing contracts. A manufacturer, {{acting as a}} leader in the channel, offers a retailer a revenue-sharing contract and wholesale price. The retailer, acting as a follower in the channel, decides the product quantity and retail price. The numerical indicate that the profits of channel, manufacturer and retailer for the vertically decentralized channel in the electronic marketplaces are generally better off than those in the traditional marketplaces. Background Recently, electronically-enabled channels have offered the potential for improving channel performance by changing the quantity and the velocity of information flow among channel partners [1]. The most important requirement for an effective channel partnership, especially toward the revenue-sharing contracts, is <b>advanced</b> <b>information</b> <b>system,</b> essentially to cut down on data transfer time and entry mistakes.

40|$|This {{research}} effort prototypes an {{implementation of}} a standard interface, Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS), which is an Open Geospatial Consortium(OGC) standard, to enable users to define, test, upload and execute algorithms for on-orbit sensor systems. The user is able to customize on-orbit data products that result from raw data streaming from an instrument. This extends the SensorWeb 2. 0 concept that was developed under a previous <b>Advanced</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> Technology (AIST) effort in which web services wrap sensors and a standardized Extensible Markup Language (XML) based scripting workflow language orchestrates processing steps across multiple domains. SensorWeb 3 G extends the concept by providing the user controls into the flight software modules associated with on-orbit sensor and thus provides a degree of flexibility which does not presently exist. The successful demonstrations to date will be presented, which includes a realistic HyspIRI decadal mission testbed. Furthermore, benchmarks that were run will also be presented along with future demonstration and benchmark tests planned. Finally, we conclude with implications {{for the future and}} how this concept dovetails into efforts to develop "cloud computing" methods and standards...|$|E

Discussions on spatial data modeling including spatial operators, databasing for 3 D spatial objects, and utility objects form major part of the paper.

Now, the commander and his subordinates share a near-real time enhanced flow of information. The introduction of FBCB 2 -BFT greatly improves the ability to obtain SA and knowledge at all levels. This study examines the impact of FBCB 2 -BFT on tactical level command and control (C 2) and decision making. Via a survey, the researcher's elicited opinions from 114 veterans of Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom about the effects of FBCB 2 -BFT on operational decision making and its impact in real world situations.

This initiative is being developed to assist in the development of an efficient and sustainable water resources management system for Nicamgua. The Vital Issues process was used to provide information for developing a project that will develop and implement an <b>advanced</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> for managing Nicaragua's water resources. Three Vital Issues panel meetings were convened to 1) develop a mission statement and evaluation criteria for identifying and ranking the issues vital to water resources management in Nicaragua 2) define and rank the vital issues; and 3) identify a preliminary list of information needed to address the vital issues. The selection of panelists from the four basic institutional perspectives- government, industiy, academe, and citizens' groups (through nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)) -ensured a high level of stakeholder representation on the panels. The already existing need for a water resource management information system has been magnified in the aftemnath of Hurricane Mitch. This information system would be beneficial for an early warning system in emergencies, and the modeling and simulation capabilities of the system would allow for advanced planning. Additionally, the outreach program will provide education to help Nicaraguan improve their water hygiene practices...|$|E
30|$|So, if we {{consider}} a train passing through a LX at a maximum speed of 160  kph, a conventional train with 15 wagons would need approximately 900  m to stop. Then, starting from this 1  km communication range order of magnitude and using the information in Table  3, we can select the best candidates to support an effective LX track-to-train <b>advanced</b> <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> Loading a continuous coverage communication system with the only locally LX significant information would be ineffective. Thus, GSM-R and satellite communication are not feasible. WiMAX would provide more range than necessary. WLAN {{with two or three}} consecutive repeaters and corresponding hops would provide the necessary communication range. For our LX application, in addition to train communication, a reliable, safe and high data communication link for car-to-car (C 2 C) and C 2 I is also required. Therefore, in this section we will also evaluate the potential of this WLAN technology for road applications. The recent European Commission decision providing a single EU-wide 30  MHz frequency band {{that can be used for}} road safety applications will be presented and analyzed as well as results from simulations for a short range radio C 2 C communication system. This recent Commission Decision paves the way for a possible mandatory C 2 C and C 2 I wireless communication system to be installed in all road vehicles circulating in Europe, in several years.|$|E
