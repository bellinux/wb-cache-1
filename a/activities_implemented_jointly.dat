40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{bilateral cooperation}} between developed countries (home country) {{and developing countries}} (host country) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to enhance carbon dioxide sinks. With the home-host country pair as the unit of analysis, our logistic regression model examines 158 <b>Activities</b> <b>Implemented</b> <b>Jointly</b> (AIJ) investment projects from 1993 until 2002 across 2541 country-pairs. Because the marginal costs of reducing emissions may be lower in developing countries, the AIJ projects served as a policy laboratory to assess whether such investments might be advantageous to both countries in the event future regimes allowed emission credits from such bilateral projects. Instead of investing in home countries where maximum pollution reductions (or carbon sequestration) might be possible, home countries invest in locations where they can conduct their policy experiments at low transaction costs. Prior trade and aid relationships were used as a proxy. Regarding energy projects, location decisions are driven by home countries’ desire to reduce air pollution that they receive from abroad. Geography – proximity of a host country to a home country – in interaction with host country's coal production, {{is a very important}} driver of location decision in AIJ energy sector projects. Location of sequestration projects is impacted by the host country's potential for avoiding deforestation as well as by previous aid and trade patterns between a home and a host country. Proximity is not important in this case. Copyright Springer Science + Business Media B.

However, a major concern of potential host countries is that, if they utilize their low-cost options for JI now, they will be left with only high cost options in the future, thereby penalizing them {{at a time when}} they may be obligated to mitigate GHGs themselves. This paper formalizes this hypothesis by utilizing an optimal control framework analogous to the Hotelling model of non-renewable resource extraction. The results are that cumulative abatement effects can impose costs on the future, but that they can be offset by technological change, market power, or compensation.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the rural poor of south Asia and their {{struggle}} to cope with the seasonal risk of unemployment and the ensuing income risks. In the absence of formal credit or insurance markets the rural poor typically resort to, among other options, the following informal strategies to cope with seasonal income risks: (i) seasonal rural-to-urban migration, and (ii) mutual (ex-post) transfers between families of friends and relatives. Access to credit through a microfinance institution could also provide a competing source of insurance. The question raised in this paper is how the access to credit may affect the more traditional/time honoured means of risk coping, such as seasonal migration. Given that credit, i. e., a creditfinanced activity, is potentially a substitute for seasonal migration, it is reasonable to argue that easy access to credit (or high return on credit) will lower the incidence of migration. However, there also exists a potential complementarity between the two <b>activities</b> (if <b>implemented</b> <b>jointly)</b> in terms of gains due to diversification of income risks. That is, given that income from migration is not typically subject to the same shocks as income generated by a credit-financed activity, a joint adoption of both activities creates opportunities for diversification of risk in the family incomes portfolio. If the diversification gains are large enough then the adoption of both activities jointly will be preferred to adopting either of the activities individually. In that event, introduction of microfinance in rural societies may result in raising the incidence of migration. The joint adoption case for rural households is modelled using a choice theoretic framework, and exact conditions are derived for when joint adoption is preferable to adoption of a single project. The model of joint adoption is estimated by applying a Bivariate Probit regression model on a single cross-section of household survey data from rural Bangladesh. Our preliminary results show that indeed the probability of participation in migration by household members is positively related to the probability of the household being a credit recipient.

The <b>Activities</b> <b>Implemented</b> <b>Jointly</b> (AIJ) pilot phase and the Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) programme give indications {{about the level of}} these costs. Under current estimates of world market prices for greenhouse gas emission permits, projects with annual emission reductions of less than 50, 000 t CO 2 equivalent are unlikely to be viable; for micro projects transaction costs can reach several hundred ? per t CO 2 equivalent. Thus, the Marrakech Accord rule to have special rules for small scale CDM projects makes sense, even if the thresholds chosen advantage certain project types; projects below 1000 t CO 2 equivalent per year should get further exemptions. An alternative solution with no risk for the environmental credibility of the projects would be to subsidise baseline setting and charge lower, subsidised fees for small projects for the different steps of the CDM/second track JI project cycle...|$|E

We focus only on three aspects (financial additionality, credit sharing and geographical distribution) and conclude that the performance of the AIJ programs was in general fairly poor. Because the AIJ experience prepares the grounds and is fundamental for the design of two project-based mechanisms from the Kyoto Protocol (JI and CDM), these failures must be overcome and strong sustainable development criteria must be set for each project. clean development mechanism; credit sharing; empiricism; financial additionality; geographical distribution; sustainable development; global warming abatement; technology transfer; developing countries; greenhouse gases; climate change; emission reduction; Kyoto Protocol. ...|$|E

40|$|Despite good {{intentions}} {{to get a}} solid grasp of various technical issues and put in place policy instruments related {{to the implementation of}} the Kyoto Protocol, Indonesia’s government still faces tremendous challenges in terms of disseminating information on the progress of climate treaty negotiations and gaining as wide public support as possible.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{constraints}} {{and opportunities for}} private-sector participation in <b>Activities</b> <b>Implemented</b> <b>Jointly</b> under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. After some initial background, the discussion turns to the United States Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI) —its objectives, proposal review and evaluation criteria, and a classification of project proposals by project type and stage of development. Two USIJI projects are developed as case studies. One case is an energy end use project that has gained formal acceptance and financing. The other case is an energy production project proposal that has not secured acceptance or financing. In both cases, transaction costs were substantial, and project proponents regarded gaining formal host country acceptance as the principal impediment to project development. The cases illustrate how the host country JI project approval process can become entangled in broader struggles over economic reforms. The cases also suggest that JI project proponents may have divergent perspectives on the speculative value of greenhouse gas (GHG) credits. An enforceable cap on GHG emissions in the project funders’ countries, which is a prerequisite to establishing any market for the credits, {{is contrary to the}} position of energy and power suppliers who promote voluntary emissions reductions. For emissions reduction technology firms, however, establishing a value for GHG credits would help generate demand for the firms’ stock in trade. Finally, the study underscores that notwithstanding transaction costs associated with JI proposal development and acceptance, financing remains the ultimate hurdle to project implementation. ...|$|E
40|$|International climate {{policy has}} {{assigned}} {{the leading role}} in emissions abatement to the industrialized countries while developing countries remain uncommitted to binding emission reduction targets. However, cooperation between the industrialized and the developing world through joint implementation of emission abatement promises substantial economic gains to both parties. In this context, the policy debate on joint implementation has addressed {{the question of how}} investment risks to project-based emission crediting between industrialized countries and developing countries affect the magnitude and distribution of such gains. In our quantitative analysis, we find that the incorporation of country-specific investment risks induces rather small changes vis-?-vis a situation where investment risks are neglected. Only if investors go for high safety of returns is there a distinct decline in the overall volume of emission crediting and the associated total economic benefits. While the welfare effects of risk incorporation for industrialized countries are unequivocally negative, the implications across developing countries are ambiguous. Whereas low-risk developing countries attract higher project volumes and benefit from higher effective prices per emission credit compared to a reference scenario without risk, the opposite applies to high-risk countries. Sensitivity analysis with respect to higher risk estimates show that shifts in the comparative advantage of emission abatement against high-risk countries may become dramatic as only very low-cost mitigation projects will be realized, driving down the country?s benefits from emission crediting to the advantage of low-risk developing countries. This result is supported by empirical evidence on regional imbalances of <b>activities</b> <b>implemented</b> <b>jointly</b> under the pilot phase of the Kyoto Protocol.
