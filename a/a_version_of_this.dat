5|$|In Akagi predecessor, Hōshō, the hot {{exhaust gases}} vented by {{swivelling}} funnels posed {{a danger to}} the ship, and wind-tunnel testing had not suggested any solutions. Akagi and Kaga were given different solutions to evaluate in real-world conditions. Akagi was given two funnels on the starboard side. The larger, forward funnel was angled 30° below horizontal with its mouth facing the sea, and the smaller one exhausted vertically a little past the edge of the flight deck. The forward funnel was fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot exhaust gases and a cover that could be raised to allow the exhaust gases to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. Kaga adopted <b>a</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> configuration when she was modernized during the mid-1930s.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{blurring}} and thresholding, {{this method}} can alternatively {{be described as}} applying a median filter with Gaussian weights to each pixel. It is possible to use kernels other than the heat kernel, or to adaptively refine the grid so that it has high resolution near the curve but does not waste time and memory on pixels far from the curve that do {{not contribute to the}} outcome. Instead of using only the two values in the pixelated image, <b>a</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> method that uses an image whose pixel values represent the signed distance to the curve can achieve subpixel accuracy and require lower resolution.|$|E

25|$|Out of the {{fourteen}} traditional Stations of the Cross, only eight have clear scriptural foundation. Stations 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 are not specifically attested {{to in the}} gospels (in particular, no evidence exists of station 6 ever being known before medieval times) and Station 13 (representing Jesus's body being taken down off the cross and laid {{in the arms of}} his mother Mary) seems to embellish the gospels' record, which states that Joseph of Arimathea took Jesus down from the cross and buried him. To provide <b>a</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> devotion more closely aligned with the biblical accounts, Pope John Paul II introduced a new form of devotion, called the Scriptural Way of the Cross on Good Friday 1991. He celebrated that form many times but not exclusively at the Colosseum in Rome.|$|E

25|$|A ROM {{image was}} leaked {{of an early}} alpha version of the game, which came from a source code archive dating to when the game was in early development. This version {{features}} a rudimentary multiplayer mode. Another ROM, compiled from a close to release source code, can also be found—this version is nearly complete and contains minor bugs, debug code, and unfinished features, however, it lacks the multiplayer mode found in the alpha version. These ROMs can be played using a SNES emulator and can be run on real hardware if burned to a cartridge with a Super FX chip. Additionally, a fan-made patch {{can be added to}} the near-final ROM, which fixes most of the bugs, removes the debug code and the unfinished features, and translates the game's dialog into English, although <b>a</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> patch also exists without the language translation.|$|E
25|$|As it {{was common}} for private {{collectors}} to request copies of a noted public work, there is also <b>a</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> painting in Toronto. This version had for many years {{been part of the}} collection of the Irish noble family the Barons of Farnham. In 1959 it was loaned to the Art Gallery of Ontario in a deal orchestrated by Sir Anthony Blunt. The price for the gallery to permanently own the work was put at $100,000, and a major fundraising project was launched. This price worked out to roughly $10 per inch, and in the hall of the gallery a copy of the painting was displayed covered in one inch white squares. For every ten dollar donation one of the squares was removed. With the participation of schools, church groups, and others the money was raised {{in less than a year}} and the painting was purchased for the permanent collection.|$|E
