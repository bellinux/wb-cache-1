5|$|The tanks had {{difficulty}} {{keeping up with}} the advance. One obstacle was mines. On the first day, the 2/7th Field Company lifted fourteen mines but a tractor broke a track running over a mine. On 7 December, two more tanks were damaged by mines, one beyond repair. The sappers then cut a new track which they corduroyed. To support the attack on Lakona, the tanks had to cross a creek with steep coral banks, swollen by a torrential downpour. While efforts were made to bring up <b>a</b> <b>compressor,</b> tanks fired into banks and holes were packed with explosives and detonated. On the evening of 16 December, the infantry were joined by five Matilda tanks, and overran the Japanese positions. They counted 47 Japanese dead; and killed another 17 in mopping-up operations the next day. On 20 December, aided by four Matilda tanks and 750 rounds from the 25-pounders, the 4th Infantry Brigade occupied the Fortification Point area. Between 5 and 20 December, the4th Infantry Brigade reported 65 killed and 136 wounded. Japanese casualties were 420 killed and 136 found dead, victims of disease, malnutrition and suicide. Only six Japanese prisoners were taken.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> linear <b>compressor</b> for <b>a</b> {{domestic}} refrigerator-freezer has {{energy saving}} potential compared with <b>a</b> reciprocating <b>compressor</b> because of <b>a</b> low friction loss and free piston system. <b>A</b> linear <b>compressor</b> can control the piston stroke since {{it does not have}} mechanical restriction of piston movement. Therefore, the energy consumption of a domestic refrigerator-freezer using <b>a</b> linear <b>compressor</b> can be reduced by changing the cooling capacity of the compressor. In order to investigate the performance of a refrigerator-freezer with parallel evaporators using <b>a</b> linear <b>compressor</b> and the relation between cooling capacity of the linear compressor and cooling load, experimental simulation is conducted with variation of the capacity of <b>a</b> linear <b>compressor,</b> <b>an</b> ambient temperature, and cooling load. In addition, the power consumption of <b>a</b> linear <b>compressor</b> is compared to that of <b>an</b> inverter reciprocating <b>compressor</b> in <b>a</b> refrigerator-freezer. The performance of <b>a</b> linear <b>compressor</b> is measured with variation of the capacity of <b>a</b> linear <b>compressor</b> from 60 % to 100 % of the maximum capacity in a refrigerator-freezer. Based on the experimental data, the power consumption of <b>a</b> linear <b>compressor</b> is reduced by 22. 4 % with 70 % capacity compared to 100 % but on-time ratio is increased by 12. 8 %...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{model of}} <b>a</b> linear <b>compressor</b> for electronics cooling was previously presented by Bradshaw et al. (2011). The current work utilizes this model {{to explore the}} energy recovery characteristics of <b>a</b> linear <b>compressor</b> as compared to those of <b>a</b> reciprocating <b>compressor.</b> An analysis {{of the impact of}} dead (clearance) volume on both a linear and reciprocating compressor is presented. It is shown that the volumetric efficiency of linear and reciprocating compressors displays similar trends as the amount of dead volume in the cylinder is increased. However, the overall performance of the linear compressor remains relatively unaffected by an increase in dead volume while <b>a</b> reciprocating <b>compressor</b> suffers from <b>a</b> proportional decrease in overall performance. It is shown that {{this is due to the}} ability of <b>a</b> linear <b>compressor</b> to recapture energy of the compressed gas during the expansion process.

However, passengers in a jet powered aircraft may become quite alarmed by other engine events such as <b>a</b> <b>compressor</b> surge — a malfunction that is typified by loud bangs and even flames from the engine’s inlet and tailpipe. <b>A</b> <b>compressor</b> surge is a disruption of the airflow through a gas turbine jet engine that can be caused by engine deterioration, a crosswind over the engine’s inlet, ingestion of foreign material, or an internal component failure such as a broken blade.
