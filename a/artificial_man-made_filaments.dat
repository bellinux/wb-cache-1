50|$|Attempts to {{identify}} the characteristics of wildness are varied. One consideration sees wildness as that part of nature which is not controllable by humans. Nature retains a measure of autonomy, or wildness, apart from human constructions (Evanoff, 2005). Another version of this theme is that wildness produces things that are natural, while humans produce things that are <b>artificial</b> (<b>man-made).</b> Ambiguities about {{the distinction between the}} natural and the artificial animate much of art, literature and philosophy. There is the perception that naturally produced items have a greater elegance over artificial things. Modern zoos seek to improve the health and vigour of animals by simulating natural settings, in a move away from stark man-made structures.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} start an OPM model of a system, {{the first step is}} to {{determine}} the function of the system—the main process of the system.

After the function of the system aligns with the functional value expectation of its main beneficiary, the modeler identifies and adds other principal stakeholders to the OPM model. Modeling a system starts by defining, naming, and depicting the function of the system, which is also its top-level process.|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, many of the {{fascinating}} and previously almost unconceivable properties predicted for those novel, <b>artificial,</b> <b>man-made</b> materials, so called metamaterials, were demonstrated {{to be not only}} a tangible reality, but a very useful one. However, plenty of the best achievements in that newly discovered field are far from having a direct translation to the, in many aspects more interesting, high frequency range, without being burdened not only by technological difficulties, but also conceptual ones. Of particular importance within the realm of optical metamaterials having a negative index of refraction, often designated negative-index metamaterials (NIM), is the issue of simultaneously achieving a strong response of the system and low associated losses. In the present work, we demonstrate the possibility to use hybrid metal-semiconductor nanowires to obtain an isotropic optical NIM, with very strong electric and magnetic responses, which exhibits extremely low losses (about two orders of magnitude better than present optical NIMs).

5000|$|In the {{simplest}} terms, a concept {{is a name}} or label that regards or treats an abstraction {{as if it had}} concrete or material existence, such as a person, a place, or a thing. It may represent a natural object that exists in the real world like a tree, an animal, a stone, etc. It may also name an <b>artificial</b> (<b>man-made)</b> object like a chair, computer, house, etc. Abstract ideas and knowledge domains such as freedom, equality, science, happiness, etc., are also symbolized by concepts. It is important to realize that a concept is merely a symbol, a representation of the abstraction. The word is not to be mistaken for the thing. For example, the word [...] "moon" [...] (a concept) is not the large, bright, shape-changing object up in the sky, but only represents that celestial object. Concepts are created (named) to describe, explain and capture reality as it is known and understood.|$|R

40|$|Typical spider {{dragline}} silk {{tends to}} outperform other natural fibres and most <b>man-made</b> <b>filaments.</b> However, even {{small changes in}} spinning conditions can have large effects on the mechanical properties of a silk fibre {{as well as on}} its water uptake. Absorbed water leads to significant shrinkage in an unrestrained dragline fibre and reversibly converts the material into a rubber. This process is known as supercontraction and may be a functional adaptation for the silk's role in the spider's web. Supercontraction is thought to be controlled by specific motifs in the silk proteins and to be induced by the entropy-driven recoiling of molecular chains. In analogy, in man-made fibres thermal shrinkage induces changes in mechanical properties attributable to the entropy-driven disorientation of 'unfrozen' molecular chains (as in polyethylene terephthalate) or the 'broken' intermolecular hydrogen bonds (as in nylons). Here we show for Nephila major-ampullate silk how in a biological fibre the spinning conditions affect the interplay between shrinkage and mechanical characteristics. This interaction reveals design principles linking the exceptional properties of silk to its molecular orientation.

40|$|When absorbed, a photon {{of a given}} {{energy has}} the same {{chemical}} and biological effect whether {{it comes from the}} sun or from an <b>artificial,</b> <b>man-made</b> source like a sun bed. If the spectrum and intensity of a sun bed are the same as those of the sun, the biological effects will be exactly the same. The main difference between radiation from sun and sun beds is that sun beds emit less visible light. This may affect the relative efficiency of photoreactivation, a process through which ultraviolet (UV) -induced DNA damage is repaired. Sun creams do not only reduce the intensity of the radiation reaching living skin tissue, but also changes the spectrum of the radiation, since they are mainly designed to reduce erythemogenesis, which is induced mainly by UVB radiation (280 - 320 nm). However, other biological effects, such as generation of melanomas, skin ageing and photosensitization associated with endogenous and exogenous dyes, may be caused also by UVA radiation (320 - 400 nm) and even by visible light...|$|R

50|$|The general {{definition}} of a pozzolan embraces {{a large number of}} materials which vary widely in terms of origin, composition and properties. Both natural and <b>artificial</b> (<b>man-made)</b> materials show pozzolanic activity and are used as supplementary cementitious materials. Artificial pozzolans can be produced deliberately, for instance by thermal activation of kaolin-clays to obtain metakaolin, or can be obtained as waste or by-products from high-temperature process such as fly ashes from coal-fired electricity production. The most commonly used pozzolans today are industrial by-products such as fly ash, silica fume from silicon smelting, highly reactive metakaolin, and burned organic matter residues rich in silica such as rice husk ash. Their use has been firmly established and regulated in many countries. However, the supply of high-quality pozzolanic by-products is limited and many local sources are already fully exploited. Alternatives to the established pozzolanic by-products are to be found on the one hand in an expansion of the range of industrial by-products or societal waste considered {{and on the other hand}} in an increased usage of naturally occurring pozzolans.|$|R
50|$|When {{gene flow}} is blocked by {{physical}} barriers, {{this results in}} Allopatric speciation or a geographical isolation that does not allow populations {{of the same species}} to exchange genetic material. Physical barriers to gene flow are usually, but not always, natural. They may include impassable mountain ranges, oceans, or vast deserts. In some cases, they can be <b>artificial,</b> <b>man-made</b> barriers, such as the Great Wall of China, which has hindered the gene flow of native plant populations. One of these native plants, Ulmus pumila, demonstrated a lower prevalence of genetic differentiation than the plants Vitex negundo, Ziziphus jujuba, Heteropappus hispidus, and Prunus armeniaca whose habitat is located {{on the opposite side of}} the Great Wall of China where Ulmus pumila grows. This is because Ulmus pumila has wind-pollination as its primary means of propagation and the latter-plants carry out pollination through insects. Samples of the same species which grow on either side have been shown to have developed genetic differences, because there is little to no gene flow to provide recombination of the gene pools.|$|R

(1997) described the body size spectra of seston (materials in suspension) as a Pareto (or Bradford) type distribution, which is itself also a power law {{commonly used in}} economy for statistically describing the allocation of wealth among individuals or the exponentially diminishing returns. Power law distributions show long right-tailed (skewed) distributions in linear axis plots, but they are often described by log-log plots and, therefore, they appear as rather linear distributions with a characteristic slope coefficient. However, power laws should {{not to be confused}} with log-normal distributions which show a linear distribution in short range log-log plots; power laws show consistently linear trends over 3 or more orders of magnitude. Power laws can describe the energy or information transport between hierarchical levels of a system, whether natural (ecosystems) or <b>artificial</b> (<b>man-made).</b> The transport coefficient, proportional to the slope of the distribution function in log-log plots, can be representative of the stability, fitness and efficient performance of a system against the environmenta...|$|R
