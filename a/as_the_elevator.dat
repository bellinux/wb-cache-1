25|$|As {{the ride}} begins, {{the lights of}} the {{elevator}} turn off as Hightower's voice explains the significance of the idol. The elevator is pulled backwards, away from the still-visible service elevator doors as the walls of the basement disappear and turn into a star field. The glowing green eyes of the idol appear in the darkness <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> enters the drop shaft. The elevator begins its ascent, stopping at the first scene.|$|E
25|$|Hightower {{claimed that}} the natives were angry to have their beloved god taken, and that they {{threatened}} that the idol would curse him. On New Year's Eve, 1899, Hightower {{held a press conference}} about his expedition to Africa, followed by a huge party. Hightower boasted about how he acquired the idol and denied claims of it being cursed. Just as he left the party, he mocked the idol, using its head to put out his cigar. Around midnight, he entered the elevator to retire to his private apartments in the hotel penthouse. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> neared the top, the idol came to life.|$|E
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} which Allied unit {{was first to}} reach the Kehlsteinhaus; several claim the honor, compounded by confusion with the town of Berchtesgaden, which was taken on May 4 by forward elements of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division. Reputedly members of the 7th went as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> to the Kehlsteinhaus, {{with at least one}} individual claiming he and a partner continued on to the top. However, the 101st Airborne maintains it was first both to Berchtesgaden and the Kehlsteinhaus. Also, elements of the French 2nd Armored Division, Laurent Touyeras, Georges Buis and Paul Répiton-Préneuf, were present on the night of May 4 to 5, and took several photographs before leaving on May 10 at the request of US command, and this is supported by testimonies of the Spanish soldiers who went along with them.|$|E

50|$|Currently, the {{building}} stands abandoned and fenced off as of May 2016. The building has been condemned by Shelby County Environmental Court since late 2015 {{when it was}} discovered that chunks of concrete were falling from {{the building}}'s exterior walls, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> being inoperable and the fire safety systems not being up to code or functional.|$|R
25|$|Guests enter {{one of two}} rooms, {{either his}} office or the library, and in each room a large stained glass window depicts a {{confident}} Hightower with Shiriki Utundu sitting on a pedestal nearby. A tour guide talks about Hightower, then winds up an old gramophone that plays a recording of Hightower's last interview. At this point, the lights dim. Suddenly, the stained glass window changes to show a frightened Hightower holding the idol and then entering the elevator on that fateful night. It then shows {{the outside of the}} hotel <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> ascends. Suddenly, all the lights in the hotel go out, and there is a flash of green lightning, shattering the bottom of the window. At this point, Shiriki Utundu comes to life, looks around, laughs mischievously at the guests, and then vanishes into a star-field. A gray fog covers the window, which remains the same when the fog lifts. Guests are then ushered into an enormous storage room where Hightower kept his treasures. There are multiple loading rooms on the second floor, each themed to a different type of item. One has swords, another has tapestries, the third has stone tablets and other valuable artifacts.|$|E
500|$|The early skyscrapers were a {{range of}} tall, {{commercial}} buildings built between 1884 and 1939, predominantly in the American cities of New York City and Chicago. Cities in the United States were traditionally made up of low-rise buildings, but significant economic growth after the Civil War and increasingly intensive use of urban land encouraged the development of taller buildings beginning in the 1870s. Technological improvements enabled the construction of fireproofed iron-framed structures with deep foundations, equipped with new inventions such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> and electric lighting. These made it both technically and commercially viable {{to build a new}} class of taller buildings, the first of which, Chicago's [...] tall Home Insurance Building, opened in 1884. Their numbers grew rapidly, and by 1888 they were being labelled skyscrapers.|$|E
500|$|As {{initially}} constructed, {{the interior}} was relatively open with two-rail handrails, {{but a couple of}} suicides and an accidental fall prompted the addition of tall wire screening ( [...] high with a large diamond mesh) on the inside edge of the stairs and landings in 1929. The original steam powered elevator, which took 10 to 12 minutes to ascend to the observation floor, was replaced by an electric elevator powered by an on-site dynamo in 1901 which took five minutes to ascend. The monument was connected to the electrical grid in 1923, allowing the installation of a modern electric elevator in 1925–26 which took 70 seconds. The latter was replaced in 1958 and again in 1998 by 70-second elevators. During 1997–2000, the wire screening at three platforms was replaced by large glass panels to allow visitors on the elevator to view three clusters of memorial stones that were synchronously lit <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> automatically slowed as it passed them during its descent.|$|E
50|$|PBA Flight 1039 was {{scheduled}} to depart Jacksonville at 6:12 PM. Thirty seconds after taking off at 6:13 PM, the flight crashed some 7,800 feet (2,377 meters) beyond the runway. <b>The</b> horizontal stabilizer, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> {{and part of the}} fin, had separated in flight. The airplane caught fire upon impact, and all 13 occupants were killed in the crash.|$|R

The attendants at the five stations are primarily maintenance and cleaning workers who suffered injuries that made it hard for them to continue doing their original jobs. Riders of the 181st Street station have connected with <b>the</b> station's <b>elevator</b> attendants. For instance, one elevator attendant, in 2000, put up images of popular jazz musicians while playing jazz music. The MTA ordered the posters removed, but 300 residents protested their removal. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> attendants have been known to brighten the day of commuters.|$|R

The redesigned, multiple-cars-per-shaft, multilevel-boarding ride system for the California version of the tower required that one elevator load while another be in the drop shaft progressing through the ride cycle. As such, the first movement guests experienced is horizontal, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> itself was pulled back from the doors as Rod Serling's voice was heard: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{elevator}} rose {{quickly to}} the fifth floor. Because the dark-ride portion of California's tower {{took place in the}} drop shaft, the physical vertical vehicle conveyance system moved more quickly and nimbly than Florida's (in which the first tower functions only as a dark ride and is not built for the quick movements that the drop portion requires). As such, visitors felt a moment of weightlessness <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> quickly ascended and then stopped on the fifth floor, where when the doors opened, an ornate, wood-framed mirror stood in a brightly lit hallway of the hotel and riders saw their reflection in its glass. Serling then said: ...|$|E

The elevator car emerges horizontally from the lift shaft and enters {{a section of the}} ride called [...] "The Fifth Dimension", which is a collection of sights and sounds and star fields, again {{in the style of the}} television show's opening sequence. A rendition of The Twilight Zone theme plays throughout. The scene ends <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> reaches another star field which splits and opens much like elevator doors. The elevator enters another vertical shaft, this one pitch black. Serling's voice is heard again, saying: ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{of these}} {{elements}} are found in Sullivan's widely admired Guaranty Building, which he designed while partnered with Adler. Completed in 1895, this office building in Buffalo, New York is in the Palazzo style, visibly divided into three [...] "zones" [...] of design: a plain, wide-windowed base for the ground-level shops; the main office block, with vertical ribbons of masonry rising unimpeded across nine upper floors to emphasize the building's height; and an ornamented cornice perforated by round windows at the roof level, where the building's mechanical units (such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> motors) were housed. The cornice is covered by Sullivan's trademark Art Nouveau vines and each ground-floor entrance is topped by a semi-circular arch.|$|E

Additionally, a large number of the control surfaces, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators,</b> were equipped with a complex gearing system as a safeguard against accidentally over-stressing the surfaces or airframe at higher speed ranges.|$|R

(Before St. Elsewhere, Bruce Paltrow served as Shadow's showrunner.) Coolidge occasionally sported a Carver High T-shirt while working at St. Eligius. [...] In third-season episode [...] "Any Portrait in a Storm", Coolidge sees guest star Timothy Van Patten (another Shadow alumnus) in an elevator and calls out [...] "Heyyyy!!

[...] and eloping instead of dealing with all the fuss. Later, when the Navy Yard is seconds from exploding, Ziva refuses to leave the building without Tony. The bomb goes off while they {{are still in the}} elevator; Ziva and Tony fall to the ground, with Tony's arm around her waist, and their free hands clasped tightly <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> appears to crash.|$|E
2500|$|The Municipal Library Elevator Coup (...) , {{also known}} <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Elevator</b> Coup (...) or 28 January 1908 Coup (...) , {{was the name}} given for the {{attempted}} coup d'état {{by members of the}} Portuguese Republican Party and Progressive Dissidency against the administrative dictatorship of Prime Minister João Franco (and the political ascendancy of the Liberal Regenerator Party). The event was not confined to the Municipal Library Elevator, but was so named for the arrest of many conspirators at the structure on the afternoon of January 28, 1908. Although the coup was prevented by government forces, it failed to capture all the conspirators, which contributed to the assassination of the monarch Carlos I of Portugal and the heir to the throne, the Prince Royal, Luís Filipe. These events would continue legislative instability and lead to the Portuguese First Republic, the raison d'être of the coup conspirators.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{episode of}} PAW Patrol follows {{a similar pattern}} and {{features}} recurring themes. Episodes normally open with a scene depicting the dogs going about their everyday lives, often playing with dog toys or engaging in activities at the local playground. Ryder, a ten-year-old boy, is advised of a problem by receiving a call for help or by witnessing a situation himself. His most frequent caller is an accident-prone marine biologist named Cap'n Turbot, who knows much about Adventure Bay's wildlife. Ryder always alerts the dogs via their blinking pet tags. The team members report to their base, the Lookout, and enter its elevator. Marshall typically arrives last causing a humorous mishap that makes the other dogs laugh <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> rises. When they reach the top floor, they arrange themselves in a line. Chase announces that the team is ready for action as Ryder tells the pups what has happened. He chooses {{several members of the}} team, normally two first responders, to help solve whatever problem has emerged. They ride a slide down to their vehicles and complete their mission. When they have finished, Ryder says his catchphrase: [...] "Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!" [...] and congratulates the pups.|$|E
