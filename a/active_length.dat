40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the <b>active</b> fiber <b>length</b> on the tunability of erbium-doped fiber ring lasers for the cases of with and without pair-induced quenching (PIQ). The numerical results are confirmed by experiments. We have found that the tuning range shifts from C-band to L-band with an increase in the <b>active</b> fiber <b>length.</b> A maximum tuning range of over 100 nm, covering both the C- and L-band, can be achieved with an optimized <b>active</b> fiber <b>length.</b> It is also found that the PIQ is favorable for Lband lasing though it reduces the output power and degrades the power flatness. Using these findings, a novel method employing <b>active</b> fiber <b>length</b> switching is proposed to extend the tuning range of the laser, which is only limited by the free spectral range (FSR) of the tunable filter. A large tuning range of 102 nm is obtained using a tunable fiber Fabry-Perot filter with an FSR of 75 nm. Department of Electrical EngineeringAuthor name used in this publication: P.

50|$|VCHPs {{have two}} {{additions}} {{compared to a}} standard heat pipe: 1. A reservoir, and 2. A Non-Condensable Gas (NCG) added to the heat pipe, {{in addition to the}} working fluid; see the picture in the Spacecraft section below. This NCG is typically argon for standard VCHPs, and helium for thermosyphons. When the heat pipe is not operating, the NCG and working fluid vapor are mixed throughout the heat pipe vapor space. When the VCHP is operating, the NCG is swept toward the condenser end of the heat pipe by the flow of the working fluid vapor. Most of the NCG is located in the reservoir, while the remainder blocks a portion of the heat pipe condenser. The VCHP works by varying the <b>active</b> <b>length</b> of the condenser. When the power or heat sink temperature is increased, the heat pipe vapor temperature and pressure increase. The increased vapor pressure forces more of the NCG into the reservoir, increasing the active condenser length and the heat pipe conductance. Conversely, when the power or heat sink temperature is decreased, the heat pipe vapor temperature and pressure decrease, and the NCG expands, reducing the active condenser length and heat pipe conductance. The addition of a small heater on the reservoir, with the power controlled by the evaporator temperature, will allow thermal control of roughly ±1-2 °C. In one example, the evaporator temperature was maintained in a ±1.65 °C control band, as power was varied from 72 to 150 W, and heat sink temperature varied from +15 °C to -65 °C.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades Iceland's glaciers have been {{undergoing}} a phase of accelerated retreat set against a backdrop of warmer summers and milder winters. This paper demonstrates how the dynamics of a steep outlet glacier in maritime SE Iceland have changed as it adjusts to recent significant changes in mass balance. Geomorphological evidence from Falljökull, a high-mass turnover temperate glacier, clearly shows that between 1990 and 2004 the ice front was undergoing active retreat resulting in seasonal oscillations of its margin. However, in 2004 – 2006 this glacier crossed an important dynamic threshold and effectively reduced its <b>active</b> <b>length</b> by abandoning its lower reaches to passive retreat processes. A combination of ice surface structural measurements with radar, lidar, and differential Global Navigation Satellite Systems data are used to show that the upper active section of Falljökull is still flowing forward but has become detached from and is being thrust over its stagnant lower section. The reduction in the <b>active</b> <b>length</b> of Falljökull {{over the last several years}} has allowed it to rapidly reequilibrate to regional snowline rise in SE Iceland over {{the past two}} decades. It is possible that other steep, mountain glaciers around the world may respond in a similar way to significant changes in their mass balance, rapidly adjusting their <b>active</b> <b>length</b> in response to recent atmospheric warming. ...|$|E
