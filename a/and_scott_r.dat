5000|$|In {{computer}} graphics, free-form deformation (FFD) is a geometric {{technique used}} to model simple deformations of rigid objects. It {{is based on}} the idea of enclosing an object within a cube or another hull object, and transforming the object within the hull as the hull is deformed. Deformation of the hull {{is based on the}} concept of so-called hyper-patches, which are three-dimensional analogs of parametric curves such as Bézier curves, B-splines, or NURBs. The technique was first described by Thomas W. Sederberg <b>and</b> <b>Scott</b> <b>R.</b> Parry in 1986, and is based on an earlier technique by Alan Barr. [...] It was extended by Coquillart to a technique described as extended free-form deformation, which refines the hull object by introducing additional geometry or by using different hull objects such as cylinders and prisms.|$|E

50|$|Catastrophic {{thinking}} has widely been {{recognized in the}} development and maintenance of hypochondriasis and anxiety disorders. This broadly accepted understanding has classified catastrophizing as a tendency to misinterpret and exaggerate situations that may be threatening. Pain is an undesirable sensory and emotional experience in response to potential or actual tissue damage.A general consensus of pain catastrophizing involves an exaggerated negative perception to painful stimuli. The components of catastrophizing that are considered primary were long under debate until the development of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) by Michael J. L. Sullivan <b>and</b> <b>Scott</b> <b>R.</b> Bishop of Dalhousie University in 1995. The PCS is a 13 item scale, with each item rated on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (all the time). The PCS is broken into three subscales being magnification, rumination, and helplessness. The scale was developed as a self-report measurement tool that provided a valid index of catastrophizing in clinical and non-clinical populations.The results of the initial development and validation studies indicated that the PCS is a reliable and valid measurement tool for catastrophizing. The high test-retest relationships concluded that individuals may possess enduring beliefs with regards to the threat value of painful stimuli. It was also found that from a clinical perspective, the PCS may be useful in identifying individuals that may be more susceptible to high distress responses from aversive medical procedures such as chemotherapy or surgery.|$|E

Water Environ J, 28 : 592 – 608, which has been published in final form at: [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. With 2. 6 billion people without access to improved sanitation facilities and with a growing urban population globally, shared sanitation in the form of public or community latrines is a pragmatic way of increasing coverage, but it is currently not deemed 'improved'. This paper explores the variety of facilities that currently exist in order to identify what would enable some of these latrines to be classed as acceptable and to ensure that future shared sanitation facilities meet minimum standards. The categories mostly relate to issues of ownership, management, location and finance rather than technological considerations. An extensive literature review reveals that the users' perspective of acceptability is largely absent from current discussions...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Energy drink {{consumption}} {{has been}} anecdotally linked with {{sudden cardiac death}} and, more recently, myocardial infarction. As myocardial infarction is strongly associated with both platelet and endothelial dysfunction, we tested the hypothesis that energy drink consumption alters platelet and endothelial function. METHODS: Fifty healthy volunteers (34 male, aged 22 +/- 2 years) participated in the study. Platelet aggregation and endothelial function were tested before, and 1 hour after, the consumption of 250 mL (1 can) of a sugar-free energy drink. Platelet function was assessed by adenosine diphosphate-induced (1 micromol/L) optical aggregometry in platelet-rich plasma. Endothelial function was assessed via changes in peripheral arterial tonometry and expressed as the reactive hyperemia index (RHI). RESULTS: Compared with baseline values, {{there was a significant}} increase in platelet aggregation following energy drink consumption, while no change was observed with control (13. 7 +/- 3. 7 % vs 0. 3 +/- 0. 8 % aggregation, respectively, P <. 01). Similarly, RHI decreased following energy drink consumption (- 0. 33 +/- 0. 13 vs 0. 07 +/- 0. 12 RHI [control], P <. 05). Mean arterial pressure significantly increased following energy drink consumption, compared with control (P <. 05). Heart rate was unaffected by energy drink consumption. CONCLUSION: Energy drink consumption acutely increases platelet aggregation and decreases endothelial function in healthy young adults. Matthew I.
