5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} {{felt that the}} music she earned in her career was pocket money. She also felt happy {{that she could be}} based in Sapporo where she could be close to her family and friends, as well as to I've Sound who she felt was like a second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because she felt that she would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E
5|$|Pound was 36 {{when he met}} the 26-year-old American violinist Olga Rudge in Paris in late 1922, {{beginning}} a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer John Tytell believes Pound had <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had {{turned a blind eye}} to over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained that he had been there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress Natalie Barney in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the Boulevard Saint-Germain. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy Youngstown, Ohio, steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the Right Bank, socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the Left Bank. They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with George Antheil to apply the concept of Vorticism to music, and managed to write two operas, including Le Testament de Villon. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.|$|E

25|$|Pete schooled {{with his}} {{neighbour}} and friend, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham); they remained close in adulthood. In his mid-teens, Pete had {{a one-night stand}} with prostitute Pat Harris (Pam St. Clement) who informed Pete she was pregnant. Pete did the chivalrous thing and married Pat when he was 16; however it transpired that the pregnancy was a false alarm and Lou <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it was a ploy to trap her son. During the marriage, Pat gave birth to two sons, David (Michael French) and Simon (Nick Berry), the latter of whom Pete believed to be his. Yet Pat could not settle down. She had various affairs, including a tryst with her former lover Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), a one-night stand with Den, and an affair with Pete's older brother Kenny (Michael Attwell). Lou found Pat and Kenny in bed together and banished Kenny abroad, but Pete {{was unaware of the}} affair. Pat was also having an affair with another man named Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield). When Pete found out he left Pat - she was six months pregnant with Simon at the time - and then went into a relationship with local girl, Kathy Hills (Gillian Taylforth). There was a messy divorce and soon after, Pat married Brian and he took on responsibility of her two sons. Pete had little contact with his children following this.|$|E

500|$|Donen's {{relationship}} with Gene Kelly was complicated {{and he often}} spoke bitterly about his former friend and mentor decades after they worked together. Kelly was never explicitly negative about Donen in later years. However, Silverman has asserted that Kelly's comments were often condescending and demonstrated [...] "a long-standing attempt to diminish Donen's contributions to their collective work." [...] The reasons for their conflict were both personal (both men married dancer Jeanne Coyne) and professional (Donen <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Kelly did not treat him as an equal). They disagreed over who deserved more credit for their joint projects: three films as co-directors and four as co-choreographers.|$|E

500|$|Filming of {{the episode}} took place in Miami and Los Angeles. Shooting began on the first episode on 18 September. The network took {{advantage}} of the Florida Film Commission incentive program which provided a 15% rebate of all money spent in Florida on the production (which was up to $2 million) to encourage film and television production in the state. The incentive was first launched in 2003, and was refunded by the state legislature for 2006 with $10 million, its largest budget to date.

In the article, Harpole is quoted talking about [...] "small ghettos" [...] being created and [...] "rival tribes" [...] being settled together. Despite Harpole's assertion that he was misquoted, multiple conservative sites, including Breitbart News, picked up the story. Harpole insisted, [...] "I have no concern about refugees and ones that have been here. I have <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> they've been a big part and {{a good part of}} our community". Later, on April 21, 2016, Harpole testified in front of the Texas Senate on the issue, complaining that Amarillo has not [...] "been involved in the consultation meetings [...] at all".|$|E

It didn't hurt as bad to lose to Pearson as it did {{to some of the}} others, because I knew how good he was."

This {{has nothing to do with}} Bethesda, it's just that we've <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Fallout was ours and it was just a technicality that Interplay happened to own it. It sort of felt as if our child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had to just sit by and watch. Since I have absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're going in the right direction with it or not.".|$|E
500|$|Beginning in August 1968, McCain was {{subjected}} to a program of severe torture. He was bound and beaten every two hours; this punishment occurred {{at the same time}} that he was suffering from dysentery. Further injuries led McCain to attempt suicide, which was stopped by guards. Eventually, McCain made an anti-U.S. propaganda [...] "confession". He has <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> his statement was dishonorable, but as he later wrote, [...] "I had learned what we all learned over there: every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine." [...] Many U.S. POWs were tortured and maltreated in order to extract [...] "confessions" [...] and propaganda statements; virtually all of them eventually yielded something to their captors. McCain received two to three beatings weekly because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements.|$|E

According to sportswriter Doyle Dietz, in the Jets' upset victory (the Colts were favored by as many as 19½ points), [...] "the American Football League came of age". Madden later stated that the Jets' Super Bowl upset [...] "was great for the history of the game, but a part of me has <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> should have been [...] who were the first AFL team to do it ... changed pro football.

500|$|John Gielgud's New Theatre {{production}} in 1935 featured Gielgud and Laurence Olivier as Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six {{weeks into the}} run, with Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet. Gielgud used a scholarly combination of Q1 and Q2 texts and organised the set and costumes to match {{as closely as possible}} to the Elizabethan period. His efforts were a huge success at the box office, and set the stage for increased historical realism in later productions. Olivier later compared his performance and Gielgud's: [...] "John, all spiritual, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity... I've <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> John missed the lower half and that made me go for the other... But whatever it was, when I was playing Romeo I was carrying a torch, I was trying to sell realism in Shakespeare." ...|$|E
500|$|When Fenn was {{considering}} graduate school, he was advised to take additional mathematics courses by Henry Bent, then a chemistry professor at Harvard University. [...] His undergraduate program in chemistry had required minimal math courses, {{and he had}} been excused from these due to high marks in his high school courses. [...] Due to Bent's advice, Fenn added math classes to his schedule. [...] Despite his future success, Fenn <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> his lack of mathematical skills were a hindrance in his career. [...] After submitting several applications, Fenn received offers for teaching assistantships from Yale and Northwestern, and accepted the position at Yale.

500|$|Aaron Stewart-Ahn was {{selected}} to direct the video based on his previous work directing the video for Death Cab For Cutie's [...] "Stable Song", as well as work documenting the band's live performances. [...] Stewart-Ahn said that the theme of travel had been inspired by Death Cab for Cutie's earlier song [...] "Transatlanticism", {{as well as his}} own extensive experience traveling solo, adding that [...] "I’ve <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> travel is a defining human experience that changes you forever, and hope that this depiction of wanderlust, obsessiveness, repetition, and loneliness conveys some of that.” [...] He also said [...] "The idea is that the band is performing in an incredibly cold environment while this woman is traveling around the world, moving toward progressively warmer climes. [...] The farther she gets from the song's obsessive protagonist, the more her world opens up, and the less reliable his memories of her become." ...|$|E
500|$|Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad {{described}} the song's title {{as a reference}} to Karl Marx's statement that religion is the [...] "opiate of the masses."

[...] While Cobain said the narrative of [...] "Lithium" [...] was fictional, he said, [...] "I did infuse some of my personal experiences, like breaking up with girlfriends and having bad relationships." [...] Cobain acknowledged that the song was possibly inspired in part by the time he spent living with his friend Jesse Reed and his born-again Christian parents.

500|$|In 1984, American Continental Corporation bought Lincoln Savings and Loan Association {{for just}} over $50 million. Up {{through the early}} 1980s, Lincoln had been a conservatively-run enterprise, with almost half its assets in home loans and {{only a quarter of}} its assets {{considered}} at risk. It made slow growth at best, and had shown a loss for several years until it made a profit of a few million dollars in 1983. Once he took over, Keating fired the existing management. Savings and loan associations had been deregulated in the early 1980s, allowing them to make high-risk investments with their depositors' money, a change of which Keating and other savings and loan operators took advantage. When Keating later was asked why he got into savings and loans, he said, [...] "I know the business inside out, and I <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> an S & L, if they'd relax the rules, was the biggest moneymaker in the world." ...|$|E
