2500|$|On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova {{was awakened}} by four NKVD agents {{pounding}} upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..." [...] And without looking back, {{he got out of the}} car and went through that door.|$|E
2500|$|During the 15th century {{opinion was}} more evenly split {{as to the}} nature of the Pyramids. [...] An {{anonymous}} traveler in 1420 speaks of going [...] "to see the most marvelous fourteen granaries of Pharaoh, five or six miles distant from Cairo." [...] He continues, [...] "you must cross the river Nile that flows from the Earthly Paradise ... and from the top [...] there is a good view of the very large city of Cairo. [...] But there, around these granaries, there is such a great colony of rats that it sometimes seems as if they cover the entire ground." [...] In 1436 the Spaniard Pero Tafur visited and left a rather fanciful account: [...] "We went to see the Granaries of Joseph, which are three leagues from the mouth of the river, in the desert. Although they say that there are many more further inland, there are only three here, two great ones, and one lesser one. They are diamond shaped, with the apex raised, and they must be much higher than the Great Tower at Seville. As one enters through the door there is a wall joined to another, making a circular stairway which reaches to the top, with many windows. And the beasts, when they are laden, climb up and are unloaded through those windows, and so they fill the granaries to the top. [...] Certainly I never thought that there was such a great building in the world to-day, nor have I seen the like before or since." [...] Another curious interpretation was offered by Georges Lengherand, Mayor of Mons, who visited in 1486: [...] "These granaries are very marvelous buildings and there used to be fourteen and now there are only six or seven. [...] It is impossible to enter, and they are all of dressed stone ... and are in the manner of a hill ... And while we were there, we found four wolves asleep on the stones ... And around these granaries are small little chambers, several cut into the rock; I do not know what could be their use, unless at the time theses granaries were in existence there were guards in these little chambers." [...] The German traveler Arnold von Harff paid a visit in 1497 and left a fairly objective report: [...] "We went across the Nile to these three Kassa Pharaonis. [...] <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> near these three towers we saw that they were very strange buildings ... We climbed up outside for three full hours to the top, which is about two roods square. [...] From there we saw far out over the whole of the land of Egypt, and over the country to Alexandria and the western sea ... They say that King Pharaoh caused the towers to be built during the lean years, and kept them full of corn. [...] That is why they are called the Kassa Pharaonis. [...] But I could find no entrance. [...] Some say that they are the tombs of the old kings of Egypt." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} some {{personal}} {{reflections on the}} idea of ‘a good death’, a theme in the writing of philosophers since classical times. The hospice movement has made immense progress in creating conditions in which we can ‘die better’. But such experiences are still {{the exception rather than the}} rule. The psychological challenge is how to relate to the dying as they are dying, and how <b>as</b> <b>we</b> die we relate to the living. I reflect on my own experience of my father’s death, and a moment of fleeting but genuine contact between us. Atul Gawande’s idea of the ‘hard conversations’ we must learn to have <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> death are enlightening. Ultimately I argue, we die alone, and how we are, or are not, ‘held in mind’ <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> death may be an index of the nearest <b>we</b> can <b>approach</b> to the idea of an ‘afterlife’...|$|R
