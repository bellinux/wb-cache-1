Unfortunately, they may not always be able to do this because of cognitive or emotional biases or economic incentives which may lead them to act in their own self interest. Auditors are required by professional standards to be skeptical and base their assessment on audit evidence. Trust “ [...] . characterized by a cognitive “leap” beyond the expectations that reason and experience alone would warrant [...] . ” (Lewis & Weigert, 1985, p 970) is unacceptable as evidence. While auditor’s trust of clients should be irrelevant to audit decisions, there is mixed evidence on whether professionalism overcomes such biases. The research objective is to assess whether auditing professionals are influenced by their trust of clients. Five preparatory studies developed the case, a video and other experimental materials. In a 2 x 2 experiment, I manipulated the behaviors of the management of the firm being audited as low or high ability (competence or expertise in their field) and low or high benevolence (positive orientation towards the auditor) to create a low trustworthiness scenario, a high trustworthiness scenario and two moderate trustworthiness scenarios. I randomly assigned 26 experienced auditors to these four experimental conditions. I assessed how much the trustworthiness of their client affected their trust and their assessment of the risk of a material misstatement. I found that client trustworthiness marginally affected auditor’s trust of the client and that it had no effect on the auditor’s assessment of the risk. I assessed whether trust of the client and the risk affected a decision about the range of acceptable figures which, in turn, affects the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>testing.</b> I found that as trust increased, the extent of the <b>audit</b> <b>testing</b> was reduced. This suggests that experienced auditors may be unable to prevent trust from affecting their audit decisions. Unexpectedly, I also found that as the risk of a material misstatement increased, the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>testing</b> decreased. Both these findings were supported by qualitative analyses that also indicate auditors do not always follow their professional standards and base their audit on risk and evidence...|$|E

Higher audit fees imply increased <b>audit</b> <b>testing</b> and higher audit quality. We find that {{the existence of an}} audit committee, more frequent committee meetings and increased use of internal audit are related to higher audit fees. The expertise of audit committee members is associated with higher audit fees when meeting frequency and independence are low.

It has been communicated that this new inspection process will place an increased emphasis on the efficiency of integrated audits while maintaining the same level of effectiveness. In an experiment, I explore how external auditors’ reliance decisions on the internal audit function will be affected by different inspection focuses, varying levels of engagement risk, and the level of risk associated with the <b>audit</b> <b>test</b> or procedure. While I expect that there will be significant main effects for inspection focus, engagement risk and the riskiness of the <b>audit</b> <b>test,</b> I explore the potential presence of a three-way interaction between these three factors. My findings suggest that the auditor reliance decisions are impacted by differing levels of engagement risk, the focus of the inspection process, and the riskiness of the <b>audit</b> <b>tests.</b> In general, as engagement risk increased, auditors’ reliance decreased. Also, as the riskiness of the <b>audit</b> <b>test</b> increased, auditors placed less reliance on the internal audit function. However, when the focus of the inspection changed, these factors interacted with one another. Specifically, when auditors faced a focus of both effectiveness and efficiency, their reliance decisions increased as engagement risk and riskiness of the test decreased, but when auditors faced a focus of effectiveness only, their reliance decisions were not impacted by the engagement risk when the riskiness of the test was high. Thus, the impact of engagement risk on auditors’ reliance decisions depends on the focus of the inspection process and the riskiness of the tests...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{planning}} and performing financial statement audits, auditors are required to make judgments regarding client risk. These judgments permeate the audit process, driving decisions regarding client acceptance, audit pricing, the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>testing,</b> {{and the nature of}} auditors' written opinions. Although auditors may aim to assess each client's risk independently, prior research suggests individuals' draw on their idiosyncratic experiences and environments for benchmarks against which to contrast the case at hand. These "contrast effects" can result in judgments that deviate from those that would be reached using normative principles and may cause bias in auditors' assessment of client risk. Consistent with this theory, the archival evidence presented in this paper shows that, after controlling for clients' actual risk levels, auditors perform more (less) conservative audits and charge higher (lower) audit fees when clients appear riskier (less risky) in the context of other clients audited by the same practice office.

40|$|There {{are several}} traditions of conceptualizing and {{measuring}} harm from drinking. Two main approaches are {{considered in the}} introduction – the psychiatric epidemiology and the social survey research traditions. The present thesis adopts the latter, although, as discussed, on the empirical level there is no sharp borderline between the two perspectives, as there is not between personal (i. e. physical and psychological) and social harm from drinking as such. But while methods for studying personal harm are fairly well developed, social harm, i. e. adverse consequences of alcohol that involve social interaction, has received less attention. One of {{the aims of the}} thesis has been to explore different dimensions of harm from drinking, identify different harm areas and develop and apply area-specific measures using general population survey data. Two papers examine psychometric properties of a widely used screening instrument, the AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test). While the first paper is concerned with the validity of the <b>AUDIT,</b> <b>testing</b> it against different criteria, the second paper focuses on the test-retest reliability of the instrument. In the third paper, a number of summary measures of different areas of alcohol-related harm are constructed using factor analysis. These measures are then, in the last paper, applied to estimate prevalence and risk of alcohol-related harm in the Swedish general population. The analyses are based on data from a national survey on drinking problems in Sweden collected in 2001 - 2002. It is concluded that the AUDIT screens well for both impaired self-control and social harm from drinking (as well as for high volume drinking), but performs less well when screening for health problems. The test-retest reliability of the AUDIT is relatively high. In the other two papers, constructing new summary measures and applying them to estimate prevalence of harm, it is concluded that, except for being young, no particular sociodemographic risk groups can be identified for different areas of harm from the same level and pattern of drinking. To what extent this reflects reality or is an effect of the methods we use and kind of population we reach in surveys is discussed...|$|E

40|$|While auditorsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 {{interactions}} with complex {{accounting information systems}} (AIS) and computer assurance specialists (CAS) {{play a critical role}} in determining audit quality (POB 2000), little prior research has examined these topics. This study investigates the effects of CAS competence and auditor AIS expertise on auditor planning judgments in a complex AIS environment. The audit literature has typically examined auditorsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 evaluations of evidence provided by sources with expertise structures similar to their own. However, the natural variation in knowledge structures that occurs between CAS and auditors likely results in a more complex relationship than those previously examined. Auditors were given a quasi-experimental case where the competence of the CAS was manipulated as high and low between auditors and auditor AIS expertise was measured. The case required auditors to evaluate evidence related to the audit of a complex AIS client to which a CAS had been assigned, assess current year inherent and control risks, and plan the nature, timing, and extent of substantive procedures for a transaction cycle. Results indicate that auditors possessing higher AIS expertise assessed both inherent and controls risks at higher levels and designed corresponding substantive tests that were greater in scope to mitigate those risks. For high AIS expertise auditors, both the quality of their risk assessments and the effectiveness of their scope of tests exceeded those of low AIS expertise auditors. Auditors were also sensitive to the reliability of CAS as an evidence source and assessed control risk higher when provided with control testing evidence from a CAS with low competence. When planning substantive procedures, auditorsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 AIS expertise levels moderated their reaction to CAS competence. Specifically, under conditions of low CAS competence, auditors with higher AIS expertise expanded the scope of their <b>audit</b> <b>testing</b> beyond the scope designed by auditors possessing lower AIS expertise. No such AIS expertise effect occurred under conditions of high CAS competence. These results suggest that auditor AIS expertise can play a significant role in complex AIS environments and in their ability to compensate for potential CAS competence deficiencies by increasing the scope of substantive tests. ...|$|E

As part of our work, we are in the process of reviewing Weatherization Program internal controls for the State of Illinois. We are also currently performing identical audits in the States of North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Under the Recovery Act and the Department's Program, the State of Illinois received $ 242 million to weatherize 26, 933 homes. The State of Illinois awarded these funds to 35 local agencies responsible for determining recipients' eligibility, contracting for the installation of the weatherization work, and conducting final inspections to ensure that work on homes was done in accordance with requirements. Inspectors working for the local agencies are required to evaluate the quality of mechanical and architectural improvements, such as furnace installations and window caulking, and certify that the work performed meets established standards. Under a Department approved plan in place at the time of our review, state officials were required to evaluate the sufficiency of local agency monitoring controls and to inspect the work performed on at least five percent of the units weatherized with Department funds during the program year for each local agency. We identified significant internal control deficiencies in the management of the Weatherization Program in Illinois which require immediate attention. Specifically, our <b>audit</b> <b>testing</b> revealed significant problems with on-site monitoring and inspection of the Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program (Illinois). We noted that the Department had not fulfilled its requirement to perform monitoring visits at the State level.

Finally, we found that a weatherization inspection for one of the local agencies failed to detect substandard installation of energy saving materials. This case involved a furnace gas leak that could have resulted in serious injury to the occupants and material damage to the structure.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{literature has}} developed which examines {{the relationship between}} auditors' expertise and their work experience. Much of the expertise paradigm literature centers on (1) whether a link between experience and task performance exists, and (2) describing {{the nature of the}} cognitive changes associated with the link. A significant, but largely unresearched component of this link is the impact of auditors' industry specialization on audit judgment. Industry specialization is currently receiving considerable attention from practitioners and academics alike. This paper examines the effects of industry specialization on auditors' inherent risk (IR) assessments, and on auditors' uncertainty in specifying such assessments. For several constructed audit cases, two groups of auditors (banking specialists and nonbanking specialists, both with approximately the same amount of CPA firm auditing tenure) from a "big-six" accounting firm were requested to provide planning-stage IR assessments and related second-order uncertainty (SOU) assessments. The results support several conclusions. First, consistent with the notion that industry experience facilitates the development of an industry-distinct knowledge base pertinent to IR assessment and that auditors who lack such experience lack such knowledge, nonspecialists experienced significantly more uncertainty about their IR assessments, relative to specialists. This result was observed for IR assessments pertinent not only to the loans account, but also to the premises and equipment (P&E) account, although the effect was not as pronounced for the P&E account which has a more similar analog in most other types of clients. Second, and also consistent with the notion that specialized experience leads to the development of specific knowledge pertinent to the risk assessment task, nonspecialists' IR assessments were generally significantly higher for a financial statement account unique to the industry [...] than industry specialists' IR assessments, indicating a conservative bias when industry knowledge is lacking. This result has potentially important implications regarding audit testing; given that IR assessments determine, at least in part, the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>testing,</b> it implies-holding all else constant [...] that the nonbanking group would be significantly more inefficient relative to the banking group in terms of audit effort expended in audit sampling. An example illustrates that the nonbanking group's risk assessments resulted in hypothetical samples sizes for the completeness assertion for the loans account (using the participating firm's sample size algorithm) that were on average J. 2 percent larger than the banking group's, holding all else constant (t = 9. 02, P <. 01). Clearly this result has implications for audit policy; it indicates that specialization may provide some economy in the audit. This result helps to explain the trend toward industry specialization in general. Third, consistent with the notion that common experience standardizes knowledge bases pertinent to IR assessments, specialists exhibited significantly more consensus in their IR assessments for an account unique to banking clients. Nonspecialists and specialists exhibited similar levels of IR assessment consensus for an account common to most audits. Relatedly, the variance in uncertainty about IR assessments was significantly smaller for industry specialists. This result supports the assertion that common experience standardizes knowledge bases pertinent to IR assessments and reduces individual differences in perceptions about the adequacy of knowledge bases which support IR assessments. Given the results of the study, further investigation is warranted regarding questions about the effects of specialization on audit judgment. The findings presented have not been documented previously, and add to the literature on expertise in auditing. Several other avenues of research are advocated including additional questions about the effects of industry specialization on audit judgment. Addressing these issues may lead to further refinements in models of auditor expertise and serve to advance the literature and practice policy regarding industry specialization...|$|E

40|$|Road safety <b>audit</b> <b>testing</b> period; A {{qualitative}} {{evaluation of}} seven test audits for improving their content and procedures. A road safety audit is {{conducted in the}} various stages of planning the design and lay-out of roads. The audit is conducted {{in order to examine}} the possible effects of these plans on road safety. Road safety audits are being used in more and more European and non-European countries. A road safety audit instrument was also developed and implemented for the Starting Programme Sustainably Safe in the Netherlands. The Netherlands Transport Research Centre (AVV), an agency of the Dutch Ministry of Transport and Public Works, commissioned the Institute for Road Safety Research (SWOV) to develop a preliminary procedure for this programme. This procedure was then applied during a so-called testing period, the objective being to perfect the instrument in terms of its content and procedures. This report provides an account of this testing period. The report begins with a brief explanation of the road safety audit and the auditing procedures. Next, the projects that were subjected to an audit during the testing period, the findings of the report, and the commissioning agency’s reactions to these findings are described. The report gives an account of seven test projects in which municipalities, provinces and the national government acted as the commissioning road authorities. Each of the audits was conducted only during a single planning stage. In two projects, this was during a categorizing stage; in two projects, this was during a general design stage; and in three projects, this was during a detailed design stage. The stages just previous to and {{a few weeks after the}} reopening or opening of the road infrastructure were not represented in the testing period. Finally, the report addresses the experiences and reactions of the auditors and commissioners involved. These reactions were recorded on the basis of personal and telephone interviews. The report concludes that the road safety audit is an instrument that could function effectively if a number of modifications in its procedures and a number of improvements to its content were to be made. Furthermore, it appears that the Netherlands, too, can benefit in terms of road safety by the use of the audit. The small number of test projects is one factor in not being able to provide any quantitative results. At the same time, the report concludes that particularly among road authorities that have not yet acquired any direct experience with the audit, doubts exist as to the audit’s usefulness in relationship to its costs and the effort required to implement it. Furthermore, they frequently fail to see the usefulness of separating road safety so explicitly from other aspects that determine the planning and lay-out process such as urban planning principles, economic reasons and environmental requirements. The test audits that were ultimately conducted, however, were generally completed satisfactorily with the commissioner involved being satisfied as well. As based on the experiences acquired during the testing period, a number of recommendations were made for the purpose of improving the content and procedures of the auditing instrument. Included in these recommendations was the wish to simplify the procedures as much as possible without losing the essential characteristics of the audit. Certain recommendations were also made for the purpose of increasing the demand for the audit...|$|E
40|$|As auditor {{liability}} has increased, {{different models}} of the audit process have been developed {{in an attempt to}} provide more support to auditors and thus lessen their risk of adverse legal judgments. Typically these models have focused on the evaluation of evidence for a particular aspect of the audit without addressing the collection of that evidence. In this thesis a sequential model of audit decision making is proposed which explicitly considers the issue of dynamic information acquisition. In particular the appropriateness and implications of applying a given normative model of decision making to auditing is investigated, with special note taken of the categorization problem. This categorization framework is used to derive sufficient conditions under which strategies are optimal for various <b>audit</b> <b>test</b> characteristics and <b>audit</b> team compositions. ...|$|R

A stochastic simulation model is developed to determine optimal testing strategies and marginal costs {{to conform to}} EU {{traceability requirements}} for exports of non-genetically modified (non-GM) wheat from the United States. The optimal strategy is chosen to maximize an integrator's utility. Cost components include certified seed, certification and <b>auditing,</b> <b>testing,</b> traceability, quality loss, and a premium for the added risk of a dual traceability system over a single non-traceability system. Adventitious commingling risks are defined stochastically. Results indicate that traceability requirements can be conformed to with reasonable buyer and seller risk at a total cost of $ 18 |non-GM mt.

40|$|In a {{competitive}} environment, selecting and effectively using reliable information technologies, accurate methodologies {{and the right}} information systems, led to a search for an audit process. The information system audit process is therefore viewed as a detailed field program of many steps related to two basic decisions :- the information acquisition decision, addressing the selection of <b>audit</b> <b>tests</b> to be performed,- the audit opinion decision, involving the integration of test results leading to an opinion. The objective {{of this paper is}} twofold. First, we discuss the main concepts of Management Information System (MIS) and its associated audit process. A state-of-the-art related to MIS audit methodologies is presented and analyzed. Then, we illustrate the application of a methodology to several real-life situations briefly presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{adverse impact}} of resume screening {{taking into account}} the intersectionality of minority characteristics. A correspondence <b>audit</b> <b>test</b> showed hiring discrimination depended on the strength of applicants’ ethnic identification. The odds for rejection were 4 - 6 times higher for resumes with ethnic minority identifiers (Arab names; Arab affiliations) when compared to ethnic majority identifiers (Dutch names; Dutch affiliations). Sex moderated the ethnicity effect but the particular effect (ethnic prominence; double jeopardy against females or males) depended on the type and degree of ethnic identification, lending support for a within-category approach to study ethnic prejudice. The four-fifths rule resulted in similar findings. Theoretical implications regarding the intersectional effects of minority characteristics and practical implications regarding ways to avert adverse impact during resume-screening are discussed...|$|R

[...] - METHOD: The cross-sectional study including male in-patients with paranoid schizophrenia with (N= 104) and without (N= 102) history of physical violence and violent offending was conducted simultaneously in several hospitals in Croatia during one-year period (2010 - 2011). Data on their sociodemographic characteristics, duration of untreated illness phase (DUP), alcohol abuse, suicidal behavior, personality features, and insight into illness were collected and compared between groups. Binary logistic regression model {{was used to determine}} the predictors of violent offending. [...] - RESULTS: Predictors of violent offending were older age, DUP before first contact with psychiatric services, and alcohol abuse. Regression model showed that the strongest positive predictive factor was harmful alcohol use, as determined by <b>AUDIT</b> <b>test</b> (odds ratio 37. 01; 95...|$|R
