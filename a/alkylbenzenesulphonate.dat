40|$|The {{disposal}} {{of sewage sludge}} from domestic wastewater treatment plants is a growing problem worldwide. The European Community has developed the draft of "Working document on sludge" to promote the (re) use of sewage sludge. In Italy, sewage sludge could be disposed on agricultural lands but, in last years, this use has been limited by Italian legislation to avoid the contamination by and the accumulation of both heavy metals and organic compounds in the soils. Analogous regulations have decreased the maximum attainable limit for these pollutants. In order to increase the recycling of sludge on agricultural lands, thus avoiding their accumulation, we need a powerful treatment as electroremcdiation. The present work reports on a laboratory investigation {{on the use of}} an electrokinetic method for the removal of anionic surfactants like linear <b>alkylbenzenesulphonate</b> (LAS) and heavy metals from wastewater sludge...|$|E
30|$|High {{temperatures}} {{were also}} beneficial for lignin extraction in ILs. Tan et al. observed an improved delignification of sugarcane bagasse using <b>alkylbenzenesulphonate</b> IL ([emim][ABS]) with increasing temperature from 170 °C to 190 °C [78]. The same trend was also confirmed in wood flour and triticale straw using [emim][CH 3 COO] [28, 79]. It {{is assumed that}} the most efficient delignification temperature is strongly related to the average glass transition temperature of 165 °C for a given lignin polymer [80]. However, that temperature is dictated by the chemical composition of lignin (monolignol composition and concentrations) and varies significantly between {{the different types of}} lignocellulosic biomass [67]. In the pre-treatment process at higher temperatures, lignin is susceptible to self-condensation reactions. The condensation of lignin is accompanied by an increase in molecular weight, which results in precipitation during the process and subsequently lignin is recovered in the regenerated material. Moreover, inhibition of lignin dissolution after condensation is another issue that contribute to the higher percentage of lignin recovered in the regenerated material [81, 82]. Nevertheless, if higher temperatures were complemented with long dissolution times, the condensed lignin could start to decompose and subsequently dissolve [83].|$|E
40|$|Aims: The aims were to {{test whether}} Parvibaculum lavamentivorans(T) {{degraded}} commercial linear <b>alkylbenzenesulphonate</b> (LAS) surfactant via omega-oxygenation and beta-oxidation to sulphophenylcarboxylates (SPCs), whether the organism was widespread and reisolable, and whether the degradative community used the 4 -sulphocatechol 1, 2 -dioxygenase to cleave the aromatic ring from LAS. Methods and Results: Heterotrophic P. lavamentivorans(T) converted LAS (side chain length C- 10 -C- 13) to SPCs (C- 4 -C- 13), alpha,beta-unsaturated SPCs (C- 4 -C- 13) and sulphophenyldicarboxylates (SPdCs) (at least C- 8 -C- 12). Identifications came from high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation, an electrospray interface and mass spectrometry. No evidence for other paths was found. The degradation of LAS in trickling filters inoculated with environmental samples always showed transient SPC intermediates (HPLC) {{and the presence of}} the P. lavamentivorans morphotype in the community. One new isolate was obtained. A community able to mineralize LAS contained 4 -sulphocatechol- 1, 2 -dioxygenase at high specific activity. Conclusions: Parvibaculum lavamentivorans(T) degrades commercial LAS via omega-oxygenation, oxidation and chain shortening through beta-oxidation to yield a wide range of SPCs. The latter are degraded in bacterial communities which contain organisms like P. lavamentivorans, and which utilize sulphocatechol dioxygenase for ring cleavage. Significance and Impact of the Study: There is one widespread pathway to degrade LAS. Any traces of LAS and larger amounts of SPCs in the effluent from sewage works are exposed to degradative organisms in acclimated and pristine environments. These degradative reactions can now be studied in pure cultures...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Düşük köpürme özelliğine sahip, soğuk suda iyi çözünebilen ve bu özellikleri nedeniyle düşük konsantrasyonlarda bile etkili olan noniyonik yüzey aktif maddeler çok geniş bir kullanım alanına sahiptirler. Noniyonik yüzey aktif maddelerden nonil fenol etoksilatlar kısa süre öncesine kadar yüzey aktif madde pazarının % 80 ‘ini oluşturan türler olarak bu pazarda ciddi bir paya sahiptiler. Sucul ortamda yarattıkları olumsuz etkiler anlaşılana kadar nonil fenol etoksilatlar kağıt, tekstil, deri, gıda, boya gibi bir çok endüstriyi kapsayan geniş bir yelpazede yaygın olarak kullanılmaktaydılar. Ancak 1990 ‘lı yılların başlarında endokrin bozucu ve toksik etkilerinin fark edilmesinin ardından nonil fenol etoksilatların yerine kullanılabilecek başka bir noniyonik yüzey aktif madde arayışına girilmiştir. Gelinen bu aşamada birinci alternatif olarak toksik etkileri bilinmeyen, yüksek biyolojik bozunurluğa sahip ve yüzey aktif madde olarak uygulamada nonil fenol etoksilatları ikame edebilecek nonil alkol etoksilatlar görülmektedir. Bahsedilen özellikleri nedeniyle nonil alkol etoksilatların üretimleri ve kullanımları gün geçtikçe artmakta ve yaygınlaşmaktadır. Her ne kadar bilinen herhangi toksik, kanserojenik veya mutajenik etkiye sahip olmasalar da, giderek artan miktarda üretilen ve kullanılan alkol etoksilatların arıtılabilirliklerinin araştırılması ihtiyacı doğmuştur. Literatürde alkol etoksilatların biyolojik olarak arıtılabilirlikleri ile ilgili gün geçtikçe artan sayıda araştırma yer almasına karşın söz konusu yüzey aktif maddelerin fiziko-kimyasal, elektrokimyasal ve fotokimyasal arıtılabilirlikleri ile ilgili sınırlı ve yetersiz sayıda araştırma mevcuttur. Bu çalışmanın amacı alkol etoksilatlara örnek teşkil etmek üzere seçilen polioksietilen (4) loril eter (Brij 30) ‘in 20 mg/L konsantrasyonundaki sulu çözeltilerinin koagülasyon, elektrokoagülsyon ve TiO 2 /UV-A fotokatalitik oksidasyon prosesleri esas alınarak fizikokimyasal ve kimyasal yöntemler ile arıtılabilirliğinin incelenmesi ve maksimum Brij 30 ve organik madde (TOK) giderimini sağlayacak en uygun proses reaksiyon koşullarının belirlenmesidir. Yukarıda belirtilen amaç doğrultusunda yürütülen deneysel çalışmadan elde edilen sonuçlar koagülasyon-flokülasyon ve çelik elektrotların kullanıldığı elektrokoagülasyon proseslerinin gerek Brij 30 gerekse organik madde gideriminde istenilen verimi sağlamadığını göstermiştir. İki farklı TiO 2 katalizörü kullanılarak yürütülen fotokatalitik oksidasyon deneylerinde Aeroxide PF 2 heterojen katalizörü ile yine istenilen düzeyde giderme verimleri elde edilememiştir. Buna karşılık Degussa P 25 TiO 2 heterojen katalizörü kullanılarak yürütülen fotokatalitik oksidasyon denemelerinde uygun reaksiyon koşulları seçildiğinde gerek Brij 30 ‘un tamamı giderilmiş, gerekse % 90 civarında organik madde minerilizasyonu gerçekleştirilmiştir. Elde edilen bu sonuçlardan hareketle Degussa P 25 TiO 2 xvi heterojen katalizörü kullanılarak UV-A ışınımı altında alkol etoksilatları temsil etmek üzere seçilen polioksietilen (4) loril eterin sulu çözeltilerden uygun reareaksiyon koşulları seçildiğinde etkin şekilde arıtılabildiği sonucuna varılmıştır. Nonionic {{surfactants}} {{have low}} foaming properties, are highly soluble {{in cold water}} and are effective even in very low concentrations in water. Because of these advanteges, nonionic surfactants are widely used surface active substances especially in the industries such as leather, food, pulp and paper, cosmetics etc. Nonylphenol ethoxylates which used to dominate the surfactant market with a consumption rate of 80 %, {{have been the most}} preferred nonionic surface active compound. Nonylphenol ethoxylates are functionally used as cleaning and washing agents, surface active agents and foaming agents. The industrial activities use nonylphenol ethoxylates for industrial and institutional cleaning, textile auxiliaries, leather auxiliaries, emulsion polymerization, agricultural pesticides, cosmetics, cleaning products and office products such as correction fluids and ink. In early 90 ‘s the toxic and endocrine distrupting effects of nonylphenol ethoxylates in the aquatic environment have been revealed. Nonylphenol, a breakdown product of nonylphenol ethoxylates, has been shown to mimic the action of the female hormone oestrogen. Concerns have focused on the potential for nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates to cause feminisation in wildlife, such as fish exposed to nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates contaminated effluents, as well as being a potential factor in the increasing incidence of reproductive organ disorders and decreasing sperm counts in men. Whereas nonylphenol ethoxylates is reasonably readily degradable, its breakdown product nonylphenol is more persistent. It has been determined that these compouns exhibit the estrogenetic activity by mimicing the hormones mentioned. Especially in the aquatic environment, fishes are the most affected organisms. It is known that nonylphenol ethoxylates are also very slowly biodegredable and have bioaccumulating property. After realizing the adverse effects of nonylphenol ethoxylates in the environment, espacially in aquatic environment, several countries have been taken act by regulations restricting production and consumption of nonylphenol ethoxylates. It was necessary to replace nonylphenol ethoxylates with another nonionic surface active agent. At this point alcohol ethoxylates seem to be the most appropriate alternative due to it‘s high biodegredability, low toxicity, high water solubility and surface active effectiveness. Alcohol ethoxylates are the second largest group of surfactants in terms of manufacture (after linear <b>alkylbenzenesulphonates)</b> and the main group of non-ionic surfactants. The main area of alcohol ethoxylate application is in the manufacture of washing powders, liquids etc. Alchol ethoxylates are classifed as easily biodegradable surfactants, in contrast to previously used oxyethylated alkylphenols or oxyethylene-oxypropylene block copolymers. xviii However, the massive stream of alcohol ethoxylates directed into sewage systems and then to sewage treatment, is required strict control in order to prevent pollution of the aquatic environment. A very important chain in this control is the examination of the biodegradability of surfactants prior to their uses in washing powder formulations. After replacing nonylphenol ethoxylates, production and consumption of alcohol ethoxylates have rapidly increased. This progression brought on the requirement of knowlege on the treatability, biodegradability and toxicity properties of alcohol ethoxylates. There are several research on the biodegradability of nonyl alcohol ethoxylates, however there are very little information about the chemical treatablity of these compounds. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the treatability of alcohol ethoxylates in aqueous solutions by coagulation, electrocoagulation and TiO 2 /UV-A photocatalitic oxidation processes and to determine the optimum process conditions for the most effective treatment process. As a model nonyl alcohol ethoxylate compound poly(oxyethylene) (4) loryl ether, Brij 30 was selected to be used in the experiments. This study consists of seven chapters. In the first chapter, the purpose and scope of the study was described briefly. In the second chapter, classification of surfactants, properties of surfactants, a brief explanation about toxicity of nonylphenol ethoxyltes, properties of alcohol ethoxylates and treatability of alcohol ethoxylates were defined. In the third chapter, fundamentals of coagulation and electrocoagulation were defined. Basic chemicals‘ reactions which occur during these processes were explained. In the fourth chapter, photochemical oxidation process was described, the fundamentals and basic reactions were explained. The factors which effecting photocatalitic activity were also explained in the end of the chapter. In the fifth chapter, the materials and methods were introduced which were used during the experimental part of the thesis. Since three different processed were used, three different treatment methods were explained. These processes were: classical coagulation-floculation process, electrocoagulation process and TiO 2 catalized photocatalitic oxidation process. For every process the same analytical analysis were applied to the sampes in order to follow the treatment efficiency such as colourimetric surfactant determination and TOC analysis. In the sixth chapter all of the experimental results were evaluated and discussed. In the last chapter of the study the results were briefly evaluated and the most important results were stressed by the explanation of importance. In this experimental study, three different chemical treatment alternatives were evaluated and it was determined that only one of them was suitable to treat model pollutant, Brij 30 compound from its aqueos solution. The first alternative was classical coagulation-flocculation process derived in different coagulant (FeCl 3) concentrations varing between 100 and 1000 mg/L, in pH 6. 5 and 20 mg/L Brij 30 concentration. In this process the least Brij 30 removal was observed with 25 % Brij 30 removal in 100 mg/L FeCl 3 dosage and the highest Brij 30 removal efficiency was achieved with 39 % in 750 mg/L FeCl 3 dosage. These results showed that coagulation-floculation process was not practical for removing Brij 30 from its aqueous solution. xix The second process was electrocoagulation process using stainless steel electrodes and NaCl as electrolyte. Electrocoagulation experiments were conducted at original pH of 20 mg/L Brij 30 solution (~ 6), various NaCl concentrations (500, 1000, 1500, 2000 mg NaCl/L) and two different current densities (9, 3 and 18, 6 mA/cm 2). When experimental results were evaluated; in 500 mg/L NaCl concentration, current density of 18, 6 mA/cm 2 after 180 minutes 70 % of Brij 30 removal was achieved. In the coagulation-flocultion experiments there was no significant removal result neighter in Brij 30 nor in TOC. The last but the most effective process was photocalalytic oxidation using TiO 2 as catalyst under UV-A radiation. In this experiments firstly two different TiO 2 types (Degussa P 25 and Aeroxide P 2) were compared and it was proved that Degussa P 25 was significantly more effective than Aeroxide P 2 in removing Brij 30 and TOC. The experiments were conducted in 20 mg/L Brij 30 concentrations, in two different pH (original pH ~ 6 and pH= 3) to determine the effect of initial pH, in two different TiO 2 concentrations (1 and 1. 5 g/L) to determine the effect of TiO 2 dosages and for the selected test periods (5, 10, 15, 60, 240, 480 minutes). The aim of experiments were to determine the optimum process terms. In these experiments that in the original pH of 20 mg/L Brij 30 solution (~ 6) and 1 g/L Degussa P 25 TiO 2 dosage after 15 minutes more than 96 % Brij 30 removal was obtained. Under these experimental conditions only after 240 minutes 64 % TOC removal was achieved. After increasing the Degussa P 25 TiO 2 dosage to 1. 5 g/L, after 480 minutes of photocatalitic oxidation TOC removal increased to 86 %. In general after decreasing the pH to 3 resulted in decreases the Brij 30 removal efficiencies. The experimental results showed that coagulation-floculation and electrocoagulation processes were not suitable effective treatment methods in removing Brij 30 from aqueous solutions. Additionally very limited organic matter removal efficiencies in terms of TOC could be obtained by appliying these processes. The most effective process was photocatalitic oxidation under UV-A radiation from the three different processes. By using photocatalitic oxidation it is possible to remove practically all of the model pollutant and most of the TOC from the water under mentioned conditions. Even in short reaction periods (15 minutes) high rates of Brij 30 removals are achieved but longer experiment periods (240 - 480 minutes) are needed in order to reach significant TOC removals.

30|$|The {{extraction}} {{and recovery}} of lignin {{are also in}} evidence in some pre-treatment studies using ILs with the main goal envisaged for lignin valorisation. Tan et al. studied treatment at atmospheric pressure and high temperature (170 – 190 °C) with the IL containing [emim] and <b>alkylbenzenesulphonate</b> and xylenesulphonate anions [78]. They demonstrated that lignin can be extracted from sugarcane bagasse with high yields. Lignin was recovered from the IL by alkali extraction and a yield of lignin above 93 % from the original lignin was obtained. NaOH aqueous solution as the antisolvent was used leading to the simultaneous extraction of lignin. The cellulose-rich pulp obtained (with hemicellulose content) corresponded to a 45 – 55 % (w/w) from the original sugarcane bagasse. However, the possible formation of lignin carbonium ions during the heating dissolution process was noted. The formed carbonium ions were able to react with the xylenesulphonate anions, and thus lignin with xylenesulphonate adducts were produced. Additionally, during delignification some amount of hemicellulose was also removed [78]. In the pre-treatment of triticale straw using 5 % (w/w) of biomass treated at 90 °C for 24  hours under N 2, ILs, such as [emim][CH 3 COO], [bmim][Cl], N,N-dimethylethanolammonium formate ([DMEA][HCOO]), N,N-dimethylethanolammonium acetate ([DMEA][CH 3 COO]), N,N-dimethylethanolammonium glycolate ([DMEA][OHCH 2 COO]) and N,N-dimethylethanolammonium succinate ([DMEA][(CH 2 COO) 2] were evaluated [79]. Lignin extraction was performed more efficiently by [emim][CH 3 COO] and [bmim][Cl]. The other four ILs, [DMEA][HCOO], [DMEA][CH 3 COO], [DMEA][OHCH 2 COO] and [DMEA][(CH 2 COO) 2] were observed to have poor extraction performances. The extraction of lignin with [emim][CH 3 COO] was 30.3 % of the original lignin from the triticale straw. This result was 2 and 10 -fold higher than for [bmim][Cl] and [DMEA][HCOO] lignin extractions, respectively. The [bmim][Cl] IL is less efficient than [emim][CH 3 COO] for delignification of straw. Additionally, [DMEA][HCOO], [DMEA][CH 3 COO], [DMEA][OHCH 2 COO] and [DMEA][(CH 2 COO) 2] are not suitable for this purpose [79]. The pre-treatment with [emim][CH 3 COO] also revealed a small change in the cellulose content in the regenerated biomass. Partial degradation of xylan led {{to a loss of}} approximately 7 % cellulose and 31 % xylan after pre-treatment. Wheat straw and flax shives were also pre-treated with [emim][CH 3 COO] under the same conditions and it was identified that 29.6 % and 14.0 % of lignin was extracted, respectively, from these biomasses [79]. One of the most important conclusions coming from this study {{is the fact that the}} type of biomass affects the extraction of lignin strongly, mostly due to the differences in composition and structural interactions occurring in various biomasses. Muhammad et al. presented [emim][Gly] as an effective solvent for delignification of bamboo biomass due to a significant lignin reduction of 85.3 % of total lignin content. The pre-treatment was performed at 120 °C for 8  hours (5 % w/w) [42]. Use of acetone/water mixture (7 / 3 vol/vol) as the antisolvent was found to be advantageous due to the cellulose precipitation and a high lignin extraction yield obtained [42]. Other study focused on the lignin isolation was made by Shamsuri et al. who used the [mmim][MeSO 4] IL to extract lignin from rubber wood [61]. Depending on the concentration of the IL, the time and temperature of the pre-treatment varied. The best concentration for the highest lignin yield was found at 0.5 moles at 100 °C after 120  minutes with 0.224 g lignin soluble. At these conditions, it was possible to isolate only 13.03 wt% lignin of the rubber wood. This result indicates that [mmim][MeSO 4] is not efficient in lignin extraction from rubber wood. There is a large loss of rubber wood lignin in the waste liquid (after lignin isolation), possibly due to its high water solubility and/or its relatively small molecule dimensions remained in the waste liquid. However, the isolated lignin was demonstrated to be nearly pure by FTIR study [61]. A relatively low extracted lignin content from wood flour was obtained with the [bmim][MeSO 4] treatment. On the other hand, [bmim][MeSO 4] was capable of dissolving a high concentration of commercial free lignin. In the case of [bmim][MeSO 4], insufficient lignin extraction from wood flour could be explained by a limited access of the IL to lignin in the wood flour causing a restricted extraction [58]. Considering pre-treatment of rice straw, recent renewable amino acid-based ILs, such as [Ch][Gly], [Ch][Phe] and [Ch][Lys] were found to favour the lignin extraction at 90 °C [66]. [Ch][Gly] removed 59.5 % of the total lignin, while [Ch][Phe] extracted only 41.5 %. Surprisingly, [Ch][Lys] showed the highest capacity to extract lignin from rice straw giving a 60.4 % yield, in spite of a moderate solubility of lignin in [Ch][Lys] [66].|$|E
