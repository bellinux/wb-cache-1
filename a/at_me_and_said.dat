[...] Canham told Elliott he could stay on as coach if he wanted, but Canham could not promise him that the job of associate athletic director would still be open in another couple of years. [...] Canham said: [...] "Bump smiled <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> ‘I don’t {{have to think about}} it.’ [...] He was ready to get out.

500|$|Cherry {{offered the}} role of Bree Van de Kamp, a [...] "perfect homemaker" [...] {{reminiscent}} of The Stepford Wives, to Dana Delany three times. Delany rejected the role, as it was too similar to her character on Pasadena, but would later join the series in its fourth season as Katherine Mayfair. Marcia Cross was later cast as Bree. Roma Downey, Jeri Ryan, and Stacey Travis were also considered for the role, while Nicollette Sheridan auditioned for the part and was cast as neighborhood tramp Edie Britt instead. On her audition, Sheridan recalled, [...] "At {{the end of the}} reading, the director looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'No, no, I see you as Edie.' I said, 'Oh, I see, I come in a housewife and mother of two and leave the slut.'" [...] The Edie character was originally intended to be a small role, but it was expanded once Sheridan was cast. Felicity Huffman was cast as Lynette Scavo, a frustrated stay-at-home mother of four, after talking about her own experiences as a mother during her audition. Cherry called Huffman's casting [...] "very lucky," [...] commenting that [...] "within fifteen minutes she had the part." [...] Alex Kingston read for {{the role of}} Lynette, and has since alleged that she was denied the role for being too heavy. The role of series narrator Mary Alice Young was given to Sheryl Lee. Cross originally auditioned for the role before being cast as Bree instead. Jeanne Tripplehorn and Heather Locklear also auditioned for leading roles.|$|E

2500|$|Knight got {{the ball}} in the left front court and faked a drive into the middle. Then [...] crossed over like he worked on it all his life and drove right in and laid it up.

2500|$|George Miller cites as {{an initial}} {{inspiration}} for the film an encounter with a grizzled old cameraman, whose father was Frank Hurley of the Shackleton expeditions, during the shooting of Mad Max 2: [...] "We were sitting in this bar, having a milkshake, and he looked across <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> ‘Antarctica.’ He’d shot a documentary there.

A couple of years after that, Sussex were playing against Essex in a Championship game at Chelmsford, when our wicketkeeper, Rupert Webb got injured. There we were in the Chelmsford dressing room before the start of play and we suddenly realised we've got no wicketkeeper. Robin Marlar, the Sussex captain, looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> [...] "You're doing it". I didn't have any kit and so had to borrow Essex keeper Brian Taylor's gloves." ...|$|E

According to a 2004 interview, Everly, who was then an MTV talent executive, initially refused to date Hoppus: [...] "Tom [...] always used to embarrass me. Any girl he'd talk to, he'd say, 'Hey, you wanna go {{on a date with}} Mark?' He asked Skye, my wife, who looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'No.' That's how it all started."

2500|$|In 2009, Peter Farrelly and {{producer}} John Penotti took their pitch—along with about 60 scripts for the vignettes—to Relativity Media. At that meeting, Wessler, Penotti, and Farrelly presented one short that {{they already had}} shot, starring Kate Winslet as a woman going {{on a blind date}} with a seemingly successful and handsome Hugh Jackman. [...] "They just looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Go for it,'" [...] Wessler told The Hollywood Reporter. [...] "It takes a lot of balls to make something that is not conventional." [...] Relativity provided $6 million for the film, but no other studio would sign on.

2500|$|As a {{footnote}} to this event, many years later, I ran across Lt. Comdr. Carpenter (by that time Admiral Carpenter) at a Helena reunion and he filled in some details that I hadn't known. We were seated {{across from each}} other at a dinner table. We were all telling sea stories and I started telling them my story (I had forgotten that it was Commander Carpenter who had issued the orders to the wheel). Right {{in the middle of my}} story Carpenter looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "And do you know who issued those orders?"

2500|$|TWA Flight 741 (type Boeing 707, serial 18917/460, {{registration}} [...] ) was a round-the-world flight carrying 144 {{passengers and}} {{a crew of}} 11. The flight on this day was flying from Tel Aviv, Israel to Athens, Frankfurt am Main and then to New York City, and was hijacked on the Frankfurt-New York leg. In an interview for the film Hijacked, Flight 741's purser, Rudi Swinkles, recalled, [...] "I saw a passenger running toward first class. I ran after him, {{and when he came}} to first class to the cockpit, he turned around, had a gun in his hand, and pointed the gun <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Get back, get back.'

He had gotten mad about what some reporters had written {{about him in the}} days before the race. Well he sat on the pole and was leading the race when he pulled in with just a couple laps to go. I leaned in the car and asked him what was wrong and he said, 'Overheating.' I looked at the gauges which were normal and said, 'Why'd you pull out?' He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I didn't want to talk to those reporters in Victory Circle.' We had the race won and he parked the damn car!" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And he looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E
60|$|Where had I been born? He {{had never}} told me where. Had he {{mentioned}} the place in Mrs. Tenbruggen's hearing? I asked the attendant {{if he had been}} present while she was in the room. Yes; he had remained at his post; he had also heard the allusion to the place with the odd name. Had Mr. Gracedieu said anything more about that place? Nothing more; the poor Minister's mind had wandered off to other things. He was wandering now. Sometimes, he was addressing his congregation; sometimes, he wondered what they would give him for supper; sometimes, he talked of the flowers in the garden.
