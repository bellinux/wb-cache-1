5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the starboard <b>anchor</b> <b>chain.</b> The <b>anchor</b> <b>chain</b> has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{perceived}} threat from Chinese submarines while in transit and from North Vietnamese swimmers with limpet mines while in harbour, Sydney was always escorted {{by at least one}} other RAN vessel. While in harbour, boats from Sydney and her escort would patrol around the troopship, while divers regularly inspected the hull, propellers, and <b>anchor</b> <b>chain</b> for explosives. On seven voyages, Sydney carried four Westland Wessex helicopters for anti-submarine surveillance, sourced from 725 or 817 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|On 19January Rewa {{started to}} affect Queensland with torrential rain and storm force windspeeds which caused some damage along the coast. However {{it did not}} make its {{predicted}} landfall near Mackay, instead it recurved to the south-southeast and came to within 100km (60mi) of the coast. Two men off Yeppoon's coast were rescued from a fishing trawler by an army Black Hawk helicopter after high seas damaged the trawler's propeller and snapped its heavy <b>anchor</b> <b>chain,</b> leaving it drifting helplessly in the cyclone's path. The worst affected island was Lady Elliot as it bore {{the brunt of the}} wind, while on Heron Island, several rare trees and bird rookeries were either destroyed or severely damaged. As Rewa interacted with an upper trough of low pressure on 19January, heavy rainfall and thunderstorms were observed in parts of Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Brisbane received over 144mm (5.7in) in just six hours, which led to some localised flash flooding in parts of the city and four deaths. Three of the deaths were from people crashing their cars, while the other death occurred when a person went surfing Brisbane's flood water and got trapped in a storm drain. Within Brisbane, 100homes and 20cars were damaged by the flood waters, while a Sheffield Shield cricket match between Western Australia and Queensland was delayed, after the Gabba resembled a small lake.|$|E

50|$|On {{the evening}} of 27 January 1974, a severe storm caused the vessel to drag her anchor while she {{was waiting at the}} Tail of the Bank to deliver sugar to the James Watt Dock in Greenock. Her captain ordered the engines to be started with the {{intention}} of running for the more sheltered waters of the Gareloch but before she could be brought to power she drifted onto the taught <b>anchor</b> <b>chains</b> of the BP tanker British Light.

5|$|On 29 September 1911, Italy {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire in order to seize Libya. During the Italo-Turkish War Regina Mergherita {{was assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 2nd Squadron, along with her sister and the two s. She joined the squadron on 5 October, a week after the war started. On 13 April 1912, Regina Margherita {{and the rest of the}} Squadron sailed from Tobruk to the Aegean Sea to rendezvous with the 1st Squadron. The two squadrons met off Stampalia on 17 April. The next day, the fleet steamed into the northern Aegean and cut several Turkish submarine cables. Most of the ships of the Italian fleet then bombarded the fortresses protecting the Dardanelles in an unsuccessful attempt to lure out the Turkish fleet. While they were doing this, Regina Margherita, Benedetto Brin, and two torpedo boats were detached to cut additional cables between Rhodes and Marmaris. On 18 May, Regina Margherita bombarded Marmaris. While debarking troops on the island of Scarpanto in the Aegean, the ship's <b>anchor</b> <b>chain</b> accidentally slipped loose and killed the ship's executive officer, Captain Proli; five other men were injured in the accident. In July, Regina Margherita and the rest of the division had withdrawn to Italy to replace worn-out gun barrels, along with other repairs. In 1912, the ship had four 3-inch guns added, increasing her battery from 20 to 24 pieces.|$|E

25|$|While in Staten Island, Intrepid {{underwent}} {{the next}} phase of her refurbishment, and received an $8million interior renovation. Never-before-seen areas of the ship including the forecastle (fo'c'sle, commonly known as the <b>anchor</b> <b>chain</b> room), general berthing quarters and the ship's machine shop were opened to the public for the first time. The hangar deck features a new layout and design including new interactive exhibits. Around 1,200 tons of her original weight in steel were removed and 339 epoxy-coated steel pilings ranging in length from 60 to 183 feet were installed. Intrepid also received a new coat of paint, using almost 7,000 gallons to re-paint the interior, hull, towers, and decks. Total cost of the renovation was $120million — $55million for the ship and $65million for Pier86.|$|E

40|$|Based on gel {{permeation}} chromatograms, it {{was concluded}} that the adsorption block copolymers of PS and PEO on polystyrene particles is dominated by micelle adsorption, and not by unimers. Furthermore, the results indicate that this adsorption is fast, and is probably followed by a chain rearrangement on the surface. From these observations, a collisional kinetic model was developed, which fits well to the experimental data. The adsorbed mass was estimated by two different procedures; a) a dense sphere packing model; b) a Monte Carlo simulation. These results were introduced in a model which describes the behaviour of surface <b>anchored</b> <b>chains,</b> allowing the theoretical prediction of the adsorbed layer thickness {{as a function of the}} <b>anchored</b> <b>chain</b> units number, the surface curvature radius and the mean distance between anchorage points. These data were compared to experimental values obtained for several systems. In all the cases studied, the experimental layer thicknesses were lower than the theoretical ones, and three different regiments were observed. These were assigned to; a) a region in which there is no interaction between neighbouring <b>anchored</b> <b>chains,</b> giving rise to a "pancake type" layer - low coverage fractions; b) a region in which there is competition between segments from neighbouring soluble chains -intermediate coverage fractions; and c) a region in which there is competition between the soluble chain segments and the anchor blocks - large coverage fractions. these results were qualitatively explained in terms of an attractive interaction between the soluble part of the <b>anchored</b> <b>chain</b> and the surface being verified that the influence of this interaction is important, mainly, for systems where the surface curvature radius is largeAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

500|$|The set design, too, {{has been}} praised for being [...] "suitably claustrophobic."

The vagueness leaves the audience unsure whether to believe Merriam's accusations against the Captain, and builds an atmosphere of paranoia and doubt which {{is critical to the}} picture's success. Contemporary critic Gary Giddins has pointed out that the film incorporates classic Lewton scare tactics but in new ways. [...] "His trademark scare tactic, a high point in practically all of his films, is a long, dark, nightmarish walk, where every sound is magnified and every object threatening. In The Ghost Ship, that [...] "walk" [...] is transferred to the cabin of the victimized third officer..." [...] Others have pointed out another Lewton device, the gradual stalking of a main character by a murderer, as another deft touch in the film.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Constant {{tension control}} of <b>anchor</b> <b>chains</b> is {{important}} for safety of moored ships. The core driving component of an anchor windlass system is an induction motor which is a multi-variables, coupled nonlinear system, and is difficult to control. To surmount this problem, a control scheme based on the inverse system method is introduced to linearize an induction motor into a decoupled linear system, and linear controllers are then designed to complete the control task. In addition, theoretical analysis based on the Lyapnov method is carried out to investigate {{the influence of the}} time-varying rotor resistance to the control scheme suggested. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show this control scheme is able to keep <b>anchor</b> <b>chains</b> at desired tension under sea wind at a time-varying rotor resistance.

500|$|A {{few weeks}} later on May 21, 1962, Armstrong was {{involved}} in what Edwards' folklore called the [...] "Nellis Affair". He was sent in a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter to inspect Delamar Dry Lake in southern Nevada, again for emergency landings. He misjudged his altitude, and also {{did not realize that}} the landing gear had not fully extended. As he touched down, the landing gear began to retract; Armstrong applied full power to abort the landing, but the ventral fin and landing gear door struck the ground, damaging the radio and releasing hydraulic fluid. Without radio communication, Armstrong flew south to Nellis Air Force Base, past the control tower, and waggled his wings, the signal for a no-radio approach. The loss of hydraulic fluid caused the tail-hook to release, and upon landing, he caught the arresting wire attached to an <b>anchor</b> <b>chain,</b> and dragged the chain along the runway.|$|E

500|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} is still unclear.

Subsequent searches located 32 mines of these types, some of them within [...] of the explosion. The damage was consistent with an explosion of [...] of TNT {{and more than one}} mine may have detonated. Nonetheless, other explanations for the ship's loss have been proposed and the most popular of these is that she was sunk by Italian frogmen of the wartime special operations unit Decima Flottiglia MAS who — more than ten years after the cessation of hostilities — were either avenging the transfer of the former Italian battleship to the USSR or sinking it on behalf of NATO.
