40|$|The Oakey-Cooyar Road (417) {{provides}} an alternate {{route to the}} New England Highway (22 A) for the north-south movement of freight, especially the heavy vehicles. Currently <b>articulated</b> vehicles and <b>road</b> <b>trains</b> are the major types of heavy vehicles which are using the Oakey-Cooyar Road. The investigation of the historical crash data {{has found that the}} crashes occurred on 417 {{were more likely to be}} fatigue related although those crashes were less severe than the ones occurred on 22 A. Thus fatigue management measures must be implemented to reduce the chance of fatigue-related crashes on the road for future increasing volume of heavy vehicles. The field investigation has found that there is little strategic planning for existing facilities. The current rest area and stopping areas are not well defined and most are not signposted. The recommended strategies to be adopted on the Oakey-Cooyar Road are: - Upgrading the current motorist rest area to a clearly identified heavy vehicle rest area near Kulpi; - Establishing at least three clearly identified and signed heavy vehicle stopping places on each direction, which may be used by other vehicles too; - Establishing an overtaking lane before the south-bound 10 % steep ascent section. It is also recommended that extra signs be posted to redirect the heavy vehicle to use the West Oakey Connection Road, therefore bypass Oakey. Further research needs to be conducted on the usage of rest areas and an estimate of costs for the suggested improvements to the road needs to be carried out in order to analyse the cost-benefit aspects of the proposals due to the time constraint of this project...|$|R
