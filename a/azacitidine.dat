25|$|<b>Azacitidine</b> {{is a drug}} {{approved}} by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) {{for the treatment of}} CMML and by the European Medicines Agency for high risk non-proliferative CMML with 10-19% marrow blasts. It is a cytidine analogue that causes hypomethylation of DNA by inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine is a similar drug to <b>azacitidine</b> and is {{approved by}} the FDA for treatments of all subtypes of MDS, including CMML. Hydroxyurea is a chemotherapy that is used in the myeloproliferative form of CMML to reduce cell numbers.|$|E
25|$|Treatments {{may include}} {{supportive}} care, drug therapy, and stem cell transplantation. Supportive care may include blood transfusions, medications {{to increase the}} making of red blood cells, and antibiotics.

25|$|<b>Azacitidine</b> {{is a drug}} used {{to treat}} CMML and is {{approved}} by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency. Stem cell transplant {{is also used to}} treat CMML, and involves the transplantation of donor haematopoietic stem cells into the recipient. Blood transfusion and erythropoietin are used to treat disease associated anaemia.|$|E
25|$|The anti-folates include {{methotrexate}} and pemetrexed. Methotrexate inhibits {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, <b>azacitidine,</b> fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.|$|E

50|$|<b>Azacitidine,</b> {{marketed as}} Vidaza, is used {{mainly in the}} {{treatment}} of myelodysplastic syndrome, for which it received approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on May 19, 2004. In two randomized controlled trials comparing <b>azacitidine</b> to supportive treatment, 16% of subjects with myelodysplastic syndrome who were randomized to receive <b>azacitidine</b> had a complete or partial normalization of blood cell counts and bone marrow morphology, compared to none who received supportive care, and about two-thirds of patients who required blood transfusions no longer needed them after receiving <b>azacitidine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Renal toxicity, {{ranging from}} {{elevated}} serum creatinine to kidney failure and death, {{have been reported}} in patients treated with intravenous <b>azacitidine</b> in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for conditions other than myelodysplastic syndrome. Renal tubular acidosis developed in five patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (an unapproved use) treated with <b>azacitidine</b> and etoposide, and patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. <b>Azacitidine</b> and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys, so patients with renal insufficiency should be closely monitored for other side effects, since their levels of <b>azacitidine</b> may progressively increase.|$|E
50|$|<b>Azacitidine</b> (INN; {{trade name}} Vidaza) is a {{chemical}} analog of cytidine, a nucleoside in DNA and RNA. <b>Azacitidine</b> and its deoxy derivative, decitabine (also known as 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine), {{are used in}} the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome.

50|$|Based {{on animal}} studies and its {{mechanism}} of action, <b>azacitidine</b> can cause severe fetal damage. Sexually active women of reproductive potential should use contraception during while receiving <b>azacitidine</b> {{and for one}} week after the last dose, and sexually active men with female partners of reproductive potential should use contraception during treatment and for three months following the last dose.|$|E
5000|$|Demethylating {{agents are}} {{compounds}} that can inhibit methylation, {{resulting in the}} expression of the previously hypermethylated silenced genes (see Methylation#Cancer for more detail). Cytidine analogs such as 5-azacytidine (<b>azacitidine)</b> and 5-azadeoxycytidine (decitabine) are the most commonly used demethylating agents [...] These compounds work by binding to the enzymes that catalyse the methylation reaction, DNA methyltransferases; and titrate out these enzymes. Both compounds have been approved in the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in United States. <b>Azacitidine</b> and decitabine are marketed as Vidaza and Dacogen respectively. <b>Azacitidine</b> is the first drug to be approved by FDA for treating MDS and has been given orphan drug status. Procaine is a DNA-demethylating agent with growth-inhibitory effects in human cancer cells.|$|E

50|$|<b>Azacitidine</b> {{can also}} nausea, vomiting, fevers, diarrhea, redness at its {{injection}} sites, constipation, bruising, petechiae, rigors, weakness, abnormally low potassium {{levels in the}} bloodstream, and many other side effects, some {{of which can be}} severe or even fatal.|$|E
50|$|Currently {{available}} hypomethylating agents {{block the}} activity of DNA methyltransferase (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors / DNMT inhibitors).Currently {{two members of the}} class, <b>azacitidine</b> and decitabine are FDA-approved for use in the United States in myelodysplastic syndrome and are being investigated for use in a number of tumors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Azacitidine</b> causes anemia (low {{red blood}} cell counts), {{neutropenia}} (low white blood cell counts), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts), and patients should have frequent monitoring of their complete blood counts, at least prior to each dosing cycle. The dose {{may have to be}} adjusted based on nadir counts and hematologic response.|$|E
50|$|It {{can also}} be hepatotoxic in {{patients}} with severe liver impairment, and patients with extensive liver tumors due to metastatic disease have developed progressive hepatic coma and death during <b>azacitidine</b> treatment, especially when their albumin levels are less than 30 g/L. It is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors.|$|E
50|$|For {{the phase}} 2 trial for MDS {{patients}} so far, median survival overall was about 9.7 months, {{with the average}} median survival overall for patients receiving classic <b>azacitidine</b> or decitabine is approximately 4.3-5.9 months. More data will be arriving from {{the second half of}} this trial meant to allow better dosing regimens.|$|E
50|$|<b>Azacitidine</b> {{can be used}} {{in vitro}} to remove methyl groups from DNA. This may weaken the effects of gene {{silencing}} mechanisms that occur prior to methylation. Certain methylations are believed to secure DNA in a silenced state, and therefore demethylation may reduce the stability of silencing signals and confer relative gene activation.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{cytidine}} analogues with potentially useful pharmacology. For example, KP-1461 is an anti-HIV agent that works as a viral mutagen, and zebularine exists in E. coli and is being examined for chemotherapy. Low doses of <b>azacitidine</b> and its analog decitabine have shown results against cancer through epigenetic demethylation.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Azacitidine</b> is a {{chemical}} analogue of the nucleoside cytosine, which {{is present in}} DNA and RNA. It {{is thought to have}} antineoplastic activity via two mechanisms [...] - [...] at low doses, by inhibiting of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA, and at high doses, by its direct cytotoxicity to abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA and RNA, resulting in cell death. <b>Azacitidine</b> is a ribonucleoside, so it is incorporated into RNA to a larger extent than into DNA. In contrast, decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is a deoxyribonucleoside, so it can only incorporate into DNA. Azacitidine's incorporation into RNA leads to the dissembly of polyribosomes, defective methylation and acceptor function of transfer RNA, and inhibition of the production of proteins. Its incorporation into DNA leads to covalent binding with DNA methyltransferases, which prevents DNA synthesis and subsequent leads to cytotoxicity. It has been shown effective against human immunodeficiency virus in vitro and human T-lymphotropic virus.|$|E
50|$|Drugs that {{specifically}} target the inverted methylation pattern of cancerous cells include the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors <b>azacitidine</b> and decitabine. These hypomethylating agents {{are used to}} treat myelodysplastic syndrome, a blood cancer produced by abnormal bone marrow stem cells. These agents inhibit all three types of active DNA methyltransferases, and had been thought to be highly toxic, but proved to be effective when used in low dosage, reducing progression of myelodysplastic syndrome to leukemia.|$|E
50|$|Based on interim {{data from}} ongoing phase I {{clinical}} trials {{presented at the}} 57th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH), researchers at Seattle Genetics have planned a phase III clinical trial to begin in 2016. This phase III study is expected to evaluate vadastuximab talirine in combination with hypomethylating agents (HMAs; <b>azacitidine,</b> decitabine) in previously untreated older AML patients. The drug is also being evaluated broadly across multiple lines of therapy in patients with myeloid malignancies, including in ongoing and planned phase I and II clinical trials for newly diagnosed or relapsed AML and for newly diagnosed myelodysplastic syndrome or MDS.|$|E
50|$|After azanucleosides such as <b>azacitidine</b> {{have been}} metabolized to 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine-triphosphate (aka, decitabine-triphosphate), {{they can be}} {{incorporated}} into DNA and azacytosine can be substituted for cytosine. Azacytosine-guanine dinucleotides are recognized as substrate by the DNA methyltransferases, which catalyze the methylation reaction by a nucleophilic attack. This results in a covalent bond between the carbon-6 atom of the cytosine ring and the enzyme. The bond is normally resolved by beta-elimination through the carbon-5 atom, but this latter reaction does not occur with azacytosine because its carbon-5 is substituted by nitrogen, leaving the enzyme remains covalently bound to DNA and blocking its DNA methyltransferase function. In addition, the covalent protein adduction also compromises the functionality of DNA and triggers DNA damage signaling, resulting in the degradation of trapped DNA methyltransferases. As a consequence, methylation marks become lost during DNA replication.|$|E
