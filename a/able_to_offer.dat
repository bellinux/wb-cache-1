5|$|Around 1262 or 1263, the Mamluk leader Baibars {{attempted}} {{an attack}} on Antioch, but the principality was saved by Mongol intervention. In later years the Mongols were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> as much support. In 1264–1265 the Mongols were able to attack only the frontier fort of al-Bira. In 1268 Baibars completely overran the rest of Antioch, ending the 170-year-old principality.|$|E

The report also states that the article misled readers with quotes where attribution was unclear and used pseudonyms inappropriately as a way to address these shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|A {{fleet of}} 40 AEC Routemaster buses were {{purchased}} from London Transport in 1986 {{to launch the}} new services in competition with Strathclyde Buses. Kelvin had not previously employed conductors, but introduced them for these services. This meant the vehicles {{did not have to}} spend as long loading at bus stops as one-person operated buses and were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> quicker journeys through Glasgow. The Routemasters proved popular with both passengers and staff and continued to operate into the 1990s under successor company Kelvin Central, {{which was one of the}} last operators of the type in regular service in Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{perpetrators}} of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former Einsatzgruppe members with war crimes. And as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to}} be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{demographic}} trends {{will put}} pressure on the ADF in the future. Excluding other factors, the ageing of the Australian population will result in smaller numbers of potential recruits entering the Australian labour market each year. Some predictions are that population ageing will result in slower economic growth and increased government expenditure on pensions and health programs. As a result of these trends, the ageing of Australia's population may worsen the ADF's manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget. Relatively few young Australians consider joining the military and the ADF has to compete for recruits against private sector firms which are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> higher salaries.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 {{the company}} was {{incorporated}} as the Illawarra and South Coast Steam Navigation Company (ISCSNC), and the company continued to operate successfully until the Second World War. However, significant problems had emerged for the company, even though it remained in good financial standing. In particular, road transport was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> a door-to-door service, (although the company did attempt to provide something similar at Narooma), and the railways provided increased competition, entering into exclusive contracts with some hotels and taking some goods contracts away from the shipping line. When combined with waterfront disputes, rising costs, and the post-war costs of ship replacement, {{the company was}} in trouble, and in 1948, for the first time, no dividend was paid to investors. In 1950 the company entered into voluntary liquidation, and this led to delisting from the Australian Stock Exchange in 1955.|$|E

50|$|Originally, 800-services were {{isolated}} between the US and Canada, but in 1984, {{an agreement between}} carriers {{in the two countries}} allowed the numbers in each country to be accessible to the other; providers of 800 service were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> add zones to cover the expanded areas <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>offered.</b> The arrival of Advanced 800 Service meant that numbers originally limited for use in Canada became available to American customers, and vice-versa.|$|R
5|$|In {{spite of}} Wiesenthal's protests, in late 1963 his centre in Vienna {{was taken over}} by a local {{community}} group, so he immediately set up a new independent office, funded using donations and his stipend from the Mossad. As the 20-year statute of limitations for German war crimes was about to expire, Wiesenthal began lobbying to have it extended or removed entirely. In March 1965 the Bundestag deferred the matter for five years, effectively extending the expiration date. Similar action was taken by the Austrian government. But as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions. Witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, as the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|The New York Giants are a National Football League (NFL) {{franchise}} {{founded in}} the 1925 season, the NFL's sixth. Eleven years later, the league introduced the NFL draft after team owners voted on it in 1935. The intention of the draft {{was to make the}} NFL more competitive, as a few stronger teams, including the Giants, had an advantage in signing young players because they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> higher salaries and an opportunity to compete for championships. Since that first draft, the Giants have selected 74 players in the first round. The team's first-round pick in the inaugural NFL draft was Art Lewis, a tackle from Ohio University; he was the 9th overall selection. In the most recent draft, held in 2017, the Giants chose Mississippi tight end Evan Engram.|$|E
5|$|The flaw in Dalton's {{theory was}} {{corrected}} in principle in 1811 by Amedeo Avogadro. Avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain {{equal numbers of}} molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles {{does not affect the}} volume that it occupies). Avogadro's law allowed him to deduce the diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes at which they reacted. For instance: since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor (at constant pressure and temperature), it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water. Thus, Avogadro was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements, and made a clear distinction between molecules and atoms.|$|E

50|$|Empirical {{support for}} {{relationship}} marketing {{as a distinct}} paradigm is very weak. One study suggests that relationship marketing is really a sub-component of large scale movements of the value-added process rather than a separate era or framework.

5|$|Indonesia is {{the largest}} {{aviation}} market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, Indonesia {{is not yet a}} full member of the ASEAN open sky agreement, which plans to lift regional flying restrictions throughout Southeast Asia on member country airlines by the end of 2015 or early 2016. Indonesia is considering opening up only five of its international airports under this policy; they are Jakarta, Medan, Bali, Surabaya and Makassar. To date, Indonesia has agreed to open access to Jakarta, yet, Indonesia remains opposed to opening up its secondary cities. Currently Indonesia adopt limitations for foreign airlines to operate in Indonesia. This rather protectionist stance was meant to protect Indonesian aviation business against competitors, particularly from Singapore and Malaysia. Basically, this stance is stemmed from a systematic imbalance between ASEAN nations; as a large nation, Indonesia is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> hundreds of access points, while other fellow ASEAN members may offer far less points of access. Singapore for example has only one point of access, while Malaysia may offer two or three access points. This systematic imbalance for exchange of traffic rights has led Indonesian carriers to lobby their government to refrain from entering into multilateral agreement on ASEAN Single Aviation Market.|$|E
5|$|McQuarrie wrote nine {{drafts of}} his {{screenplay}} over five months, until Singer {{felt that it}} was ready to shop around to the studios. None were interested except for a European financing company. McQuarrie and Singer had a difficult time getting the film made because of the non-linear story, the large amount of dialogue and the lack of cast attached to the project. Financiers wanted established stars, and offers for the small role of Redfoot (the L.A. fence who hooks up the five protagonists with Kobayashi) went out to Christopher Walken, Tommy Lee Jones, Jeff Bridges, Charlie Sheen, James Spader, Al Pacino and Johnny Cash. However, the European money allowed the film's producers to make offers to actors and assemble a cast. They were only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> the actors salaries that were well below their usual pay, but they agreed because of the quality of McQuarrie's script and the chance to work with each other. That money fell through, however, and Singer used the script and the cast to attract PolyGram to pick up the film negative.|$|E
5|$|The French army {{experienced}} {{a variety of}} command problems, especially in its early operations in southwestern Germany. After the defeat at Stockach, the army withdrew into the Black Forest. Jourdan relinquished command provisionally to Ernouf, who was a capable staff officer but had insufficient experience to hold together a varied and demoralized force. Jourdan retired to Strasbourg, where he was, or claimed he was, indisposed. By the time Masséna arrived to take command, organization and discipline was in shambles. Only four divisional generals had remained at their posts: Klein, Ferino, Souham, and Vandamme. Decaen was under arrest in Strasbourg, pending a Courts-martial, as was d'Hautpoul, for his failure to organize a timely cavalry attack at Stockach. The others had disappeared to {{different parts of the}} southwest or had gone to France. No one knew where Bernadotte had gone, and Saint Cyr had retired to Mannheim. The latter was at least reachable. Lecourbe, who had been injured at Stockach, had withdrawn to Paris to recover; in a strategically astute move, he remained there until late November, when he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> Napoleon direct assistance in his coup, and thus acquired Bonaparte's attention and gratitude.|$|E

40|$|Three {{categories}} of fluorinated electron-deficient aromatics, specifically perfluoro- 1, 1 ’-biphenyl or perfluoronaphthalene and their derivatives, pentafluorophenylated compounds and 3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) phenylated compounds, were prepared and investigated as π-receptors for anions. Neither perfluoro- 1, 1 ’-biphenyl nor perfluoronaphthalene can generate attractive anion-π interaction to anions in CDCl 3 showed by 19 F NMR-titration experiments. However, their DABCO derivative cations interact with bromide anion by η 4 -type anion-π interaction in crystals. 3, 5 -Bis(trifluoromethyl) phenylated aromatic derivatives, {{a new kind}} of π-receptors for anions, interact with chloride or bromide anion in solid state by hydrogen binding or anion-π interaction, respectively. In solution, both pentafuorophenyl and 3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl derivatives are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> induce diverse non-covalent binding effect containing H-bond and/or anion-π interactions with various anions, depending on the activity of NH of receptors as well as the polarizability of anions. In addition, the solution research for zwitterions as π-receptors demonstrated the strength and the existence of anion-π interactions can be adjusted by change the acid-base property of the zwitterion systems. At last, the inter-/intramolecular interactions in the crystals of these fluorinated receptors would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offered</b> some important references for the research of crystal engineering...|$|R

5|$|The Menzies {{government}} {{was reluctant to}} choose as interim replacement the A-5 or the F-4, {{which could not be}} deployed until 1966 and would cost A$120–180 million. Waiting for the TSR-2 or TFX in 1969 or 1970 seemed to pose great risk, but when considering Hancock's findings in September 1963 it wanted to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> a substantial response to the Labor party's criticism of its defence strategy. The British and American governments competed on behalf of their nations' unbuilt bombers, as both believed that export sales would increase domestic support for the aircraft. The Menzies government viewed the British promise to deploy a squadron of V bombers in Australia for interim defense until the TSR-2 was ready as unacceptable for both technical and political reasons. Beyond its cost, the Royal Air Force had not ordered the TSR-2; the Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Louis Mountbatten, who opposed it, advised the Australians against buying the aircraft and the RAAF feared being the only customer.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman army did not {{march into}} Albania in one group. The first {{detachments}} to arrive were the Akıncı who marched through Dibra. Skanderbeg stalled this force's advance, but, once the main force arrived, the Albanians were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> further resistance and withdrew. Realizing that both Ottoman commanders, Isak bey and Hamza, {{were familiar with}} the Albanian terrain and his tactics, Skanderbeg decided to adopt a new means of engagement. Normally, he would lure his enemy into a trap and then ambush them. His new tactic was very similar to his normal; however, he chose to approach it in a different manner. To make it impossible to be followed, Skanderbeg split his forces into several groups and ordered their respective commanders to march through the forests and mountains in different directions and to never assemble or assault the Ottomans unless instructed to do so. The Albanian warriors were supplied by the locals and supply depots set throughout the mountains as they marched.|$|E
5|$|Stromberg demanded {{complete}} authenticity in casting, language, and {{the depiction}} of Eskimo life. Casting was critical. Van Dyke cast Inupiat natives (most of them from Barrow, Alaska) for all the minor roles, but Stromberg was so insistent on finding the perfect male lead that casting the title role of Mala/Kripik proved difficult. MGM wanted Ray Wise, the actor and cameraman (who later {{changed his name to}} Ray Mala), as the star of the picture, and he would become Alaska's first movie star. Wise was a half-Inupiat, half-Russian Jew who previously starred in the 1932 documentary film Igloo. Van Dyke wanted an all-native cast, not a half-native lead, and rejected Wise. A young native Alaskan was hired for the role, but he walked off the set in July 1932 when the stress of filming proved too great. Already on location in Alaska and isolated from the studio, Van Dyke turned to Ray Wise. Not only could Wise perform his own stunts, but Stromberg praised him as an immensely realistic actor. Wise came to Hollywood in 1925, and in addition to his work on Igloo was working as an assistant cameraman. He was hired as a guide for Eskimo's production to Alaska, and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> his services to the film when the original actor quit. Although the film's credits state that professional actors were used only for the Canadian police roles, in fact the major female roles were played by professional actresses Lotus Long and Lulu Wong Ying. Numerous minor roles are also clearly filled by trained actors in make-up and costume.|$|E
