5|$|In 1816 the RIAL was <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> two new Royal Grammar Schools, in Quebec City and in Montreal. This was {{a turning}} point for public {{education}} in Lower Canada as the schools were created by legislation, the District Public Schools Act of 1807, which showed the government's willingness to support the costs of education and even the salary of a schoolmaster. This was an important first step in the creation of nondenominational schools. When James McGill died in 1813 his bequest was administered by the RIAL.|$|E

On June 2, 1829 Samuel Miller and Archibald Clybourn had been <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> the first ferry across the Chicago River. Clybourn was the ferry man, crossing the North Branch of the river between Miller's tavern and the Wolf Point Tavern. In 1831 John Miller built a log house near his brother's tavern that he used as a tannery; Chicago's first recorded factory. Samuel Miller sold the tavern and moved away following the death of his wife in 1832.|$|E

It offers an array of debt and equity financing services and helps companies face their risk exposures while refraining from participating in a management capacity.

It advises governments on building infrastructure and partnerships to further support private sector development.|$|E

25|$|Registered Nurse: Some jurisdictions use {{specially}} trained nurses for pre-hospital services. These are mostly air-medical personnel or critical care transport providers with specialized {{training and experience}} in pre-hospital care. Such nurses are required by their employers to seek additional certifications beyond basic nursing licensure and are often required to have three years (minimum) of full-time experience in emergency and/or intensive care. Certifications requirements vary but often include advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), basic life support (BLS), pediatric advanced life support (PALS), neonatal resuscitation program (NRP), trauma nursing core course (TNCC), and Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), in addition to Pre-Hospital Trauma Life Support (PHTLS). Standards also include being board certified in Emergency Nursing (CEN), Critical Care Nursing (CCRN), and Ground Transport (CTRN) or Flight Nursing (CFRN) respectively. These nurses are trained up to and able to operate {{at or above the}} level of a paramedic and in some regions are <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> base station phones for medical command. Some states allow them to operate entirely under standing orders while on a ground ambulance or air medical unit (i.e. offline medical control). Training also includes specific education relevant to the state and its protocols, and often require the nurse to train with paramedics {{for a period of time}} as well as taking an additional exam administered by their medical director before being allowed to operate on a ground ambulance or air medical unit. Many of these nurses hold certifications as Emergency Medical Technicians or Paramedics, and in some states are required to, but it is not the standard of practice.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, {{after years}} of delays and legal proceedings, Continental started flights between Houston and Miami, and on May 21, 1976, Continental was <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> long-sought routes between San Diego and Denver. President Jimmy Carter and Civil Aeronautics Board {{chairman}} Alfred Kahn had been promoting deregulation of the airline industry, which would dissolve the CAB {{and for the first}} time in industry history allow U.S. carriers to determine without government supervision where they would fly, and how much they could charge. Continental began flights from Denver to Miami/Ft. Lauderdale and Tampa/St. Petersburg in Florida. That year, President Carter authorized Continental to begin daily round trips between Air Micronesia destination Saipan and Japan, and approved a route for Continental from Los Angeles to Australia via Honolulu, American Samoa, Fiji, New Zealand and Australia. The South Pacific service began May 1, 1979. After the 1978 passage of the Airline Deregulation Act Continental embarked on a route expansion. October 1978 saw Continental begin flights from the New York area airports to Houston and Denver, and from Denver to Phoenix. That month Continental started DC-10 flights between Los Angeles and Taipei, via Honolulu and Guam. Service between Houston and Washington, D.C., began in January 1979. In June 1979 Continental linked Denver with Washington, D.C., Las Vegas, San Francisco and San Jose and also began Houston-Tampa service. The airline suffered in 1979 when the DC-10 was grounded nationwide. Continental Airlines only operated the DC-10 and the 727 at the time, so flights to Hawaii were cancelled during the grounding. By the time of the Texas Air Corp. acquisition in 1981, Continental's post-deregulation growth had allowed it to penetrate every major U.S. airline market (and all of the regional markets) from the hubs in Denver and Houston, with the corresponding expansion of facilities at both of these airports. In Denver, Continental's rapid growth provided the final impetus for the construction of the new Denver International Airport, which would be completed almost fifteen years later.|$|E
