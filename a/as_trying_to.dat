5|$|Another {{character}} commonly {{described as}} an archenemy is Venom. Eddie Brock as Venom is commonly described as the mirror version or the evil version of Spider-Man in many ways. Venom's goals is usually depicted <b>as</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> ruin Spider-Man's life and mess with Spider-Man's head {{when it comes to}} targeting enemies. Venom is cited as being {{one of the most popular}} Spider-Man villains. This popularity has led him to be an established iconic character of his own with own comic book stories.|$|E
5|$|Stuart Buck, a lawyer, also {{explored}} {{this issue}} in Acting White: The Ironic Legacy of Desegregation (2010). He said that segregated black schools had featured teachers, counselors, and others of the same race as the student population, and the adults often acted as mentors to the students. Integration of many public schools since the mid- to late-20th century may have resulted in schools in which black students perceived they were controlled or dominated by whites. A black student trying to achieve high educational success may then be considered <b>as</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> leave the minority group.|$|E
5|$|Bruxner detested the UAP Deputy Leader and Minister for Public Works and Local Government, Eric Spooner, whom Bruxner saw <b>as</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> {{undermine}} {{confidence in}} Steven's leadership and reducing Country Party {{influence in the}} government. When Stevens went {{on a visit to}} London in March 1936 for six months until October, Bruxner became Acting Premier, with Spooner as Acting Deputy. The animosity between the two became most pronounced at this time, often over the most petty issues. In May 1937, Bruxner visited the United Kingdom {{as a member of the}} NSW parliamentary delegation to the coronation of King George VI. At the March 1938 election, the Stevens-Bruxner government retained power against Lang and the still-divided Labor Party. Bruxner was re-elected with 61% of the vote. Bruxner worked with his long-time friend, now Minister for Education David Drummond, to establish a regional tertiary education institution. After the 1938 election, they moved to establish the New England University College, a constituent college of the University of Sydney in the city of Armidale, and Bruxner was appointed to the first Advisory Council, on which he served until 1951.|$|E

25|$|In this view, {{countries}} may develop unsustainable economic bubbles or otherwise mishandle their national economies, and foreign exchange speculators made the inevitable collapse happen sooner.

25|$|Afterwards, McDonough {{was widely}} {{perceived}} <b>as</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> move the party toward {{the centre of}} the political spectrum, in the Third Way mould of British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Union leaders were lukewarm in their support, often threatening to break away from the NDP, while Canadian Auto Workers head Buzz Hargrove called for her resignation. MPs Rick Laliberté and Angela Vautour crossed the floor to other parties during this term, to the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives respectively, reducing the NDP caucus to 19 seats.|$|E
25|$|In Operation Remorse, a {{businessman}} named Walter Fletcher carried out covert economic operations such <b>as</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> obtain smuggled rubber, currency speculation and so on, in Japanese-occupied China. As {{a result of}} these activities, SOE actually returned a financial profit of GBP 77 million in the Far East. Many of these funds and the networks used to acquire them were subsequently used in various relief and repatriation operations, but critics pointed out that this created a pool of money that SOE could use beyond the oversight of any normal authority or accountability.|$|E
25|$|Some historians see {{his basic}} {{attitude}} to India as being {{set out in}} his book My Early Life (1930) and as being unchanged since his military service before he entered parliament.

Some see him <b>as</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> destabilise the National Government. In this they follow Amery (see above) and Lloyd George, who believed that with MacDonald ill and Churchill leading the Conservative right-wing, Baldwin would have {{to form a new}} Coalition in which both he and Churchill would have had key ministries.|$|E

25|$|The Port of New York Authority {{opposed the}} plan, preferring a more forward-looking {{comprehensive}} freight distribution plan.

According to Port Authority Chairman Julian Gregory, it was almost certain that NYCRR would not {{go along with the}} Port Authority plan. It was also believed that giving NYCRR elevated tracks on the west side would allow the railroad to monopolize freight and raise prices. The Port Authority believed it was primarily a freight problem, but NYCRR and New York City considered it to be a grade-crossing elimination project.|$|E
25|$|German {{forces in}} Italy {{surrender}}: On 29 April, {{the day before}} Hitler died, Oberstleutnant Schweinitz and Sturmbannführer Wenner, plenipotentiaries for Generaloberst Heinrich von Vietinghoff and SS Obergruppenführer Karl Wolff, signed a surrender document at Caserta after prolonged unauthorised secret negotiations with the Western Allies, which were viewed with great suspicion by the Soviet Union <b>as</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> reach a separate peace. In the document, the Germans agreed to a ceasefire and surrender of all the forces {{under the command of}} Vietinghoff at 2pm on 2 May. Accordingly, after some bitter wrangling between Wolff and Albert Kesselring {{in the early hours of}} 2 May, nearly 1,000,000 men in Italy and Austria surrendered unconditionally to British Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander at 2pm on 2 May.|$|E
25|$|The American lawyers’ {{argument}} can be summarized <b>as</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> prove that “invisible injury” occurred in the region. Large sums of money rested {{on the results of}} this case as the decision would affect various other smelting projects across North America; as such, the lawyers representing Cominco successfully limited the definition of damage to the actual, observable, economic damage. Lawyers on both sides were well practiced with substantial experience. R.C. “Judge” Crowe, VP of Cominco and a Montreal Corporate Lawyer, and John E. Read represented Cominco. The U.S. hired Jacob G. Metzger, a State Department attorney with experience in negotiating international claims. Metzger had a habit of not writing his arguments down, and when he died in 1937 the American scientists and lawyers went into the hearing unprepared.|$|E

25|$|Many {{have speculated}} {{about what might}} have {{happened}} had Pauling been able to travel to Britain as planned in May 1952. As it was, his political activities caused his travel to be restricted by the United States government and he did not visit the UK until later, at which point he met none of the DNA researchers in England. At any rate he was preoccupied with proteins at the time, not DNA. Watson and Crick were not officially working on DNA. Crick was writing his Ph.D. thesis; Watson also had other work such <b>as</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> obtain crystals of myoglobin for X-ray diffraction experiments. In 1952, Watson performed X-ray diffraction on tobacco mosaic virus and found results indicating that it had helical structure. Having failed once, Watson and Crick were now somewhat reluctant to try again and for a while they were forbidden to make further efforts to find a molecular model of DNA.|$|E
25|$|The {{main suspect}} {{and three of}} the {{suspected}} associates were remanded into pre-trial detention on 22 August by the Southwest Finland District Court on suspicion of two counts of murder with terrorist intent and eight counts of attempted murder with terrorist intent. The main suspect admitted to causing the deaths and injuries, but denied that they constituted murder with terrorist intent. The motive of the attack was still unclear according to NBI. Investigators cancelled the remand hearing of one of the five originally arrested and cleared him from any charges. NBI was at the time investigating the case in cooperation with Europol and Interpol and focusing on background issues, such as whether the attack was conducted in isolation or whether an organization guided the suspects, as well <b>as</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> locate the sixth suspect outside of Finland. The suspects' ages range from 18 to 28. According to the German media, the main suspect and two of the other suspects had previously stayed in Germany and committed crimes under several different identities.|$|E
