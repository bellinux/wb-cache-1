5|$|He was {{a two-time}} all-area {{selection}} by the Los Angeles Times, and a three-time choice by the Los Angeles Daily News. As a senior, Braun was rated the sixth-best shortstop prospect {{in the country}} by Team One Baseball, and among the top 100 overall prospects by Baseball America. He graduated in 2002, but went undrafted <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> teams {{that he intended to}} attend college.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of what they {{suspected}} would be the general engagement, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg sought out the field chaplain, and requested the sacraments because, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> his aide, anything can happen during a battle. Although Ostrach had been a hard-fought battle, at Engen and Stockach, the Austrian and French forces were far more concentrated—more men in a smaller space—than they had been at Ostrach, where the French forces in particular had been stretched thinly on a long line from Lake Constance to north of the Danube. At Stockach, furthermore, Jourdan had all his troops under his direct control, {{with the possible exception}} of Dominique Vandamme, who was maneuvering his small force of cavalry and light infantry into position to attempt a flanking action on the far right Austrian flank.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Grace and Jack are {{discussing}} their own problems. Grace uses Jack's promiscuous history with married men {{as a legitimate}} reason to have {{an affair with a}} married man, but Jack tells her to forget about it as both of them are the moral role models to their friends. After being honest with her, Jack confesses that the reason he is wearing an eye patch is not because he got glitter in his eye, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> his friends. When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show, Jack Talk, even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire, his eyebrow was burnt off. Later, Will, Grace, and Jack all decide that it would be for the best to let Karen know the truth about Stan. Will breaks the news to her, but Karen believes he is joking. Rosario tells Karen that Stan is not dead, as she has been giving him reports on Karen. At the admission, Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will's apartment with Malcolm, explaining that Stan may be alive, but that he is still dead to her.|$|E

25|$|He capped {{off this}} period of intense {{creativity}} with another monograph, a full-length study of Wallace Stevens, with whom he identified {{more than any other}} poet at this stage of his career, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> an interviewer in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|On October 16, 1941, Konoe {{resigned}} and proposed Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, {{who was also}} {{the choice of the}} army and navy, as his successor. Hirohito chose Hideki Tōjō instead, worried (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Konoe) about having the Imperial House being held responsible for a war against Western powers.|$|E
25|$|Criss is a gun enthusiast, and {{has stated}} {{that he has a}} large {{collection}} of firearms with which he target-shoots, but does not hunt with, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> host Tom Snyder during the October 31, 1979 interview of Kiss on The Tomorrow Show. This segment of the infamous interview features Criss referencing his gun collection.|$|E

25|$|On October 27, 1989, Amy Mihaljevic {{was kidnapped}} from the Bay Square Shopping Center in Bay Village, Ohio, {{a suburb of}} Cleveland. The {{abductor}} had contacted Mihaljevic by telephone and arranged to meet her on the pretext of buying a gift for her mother because she had recently been promoted, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> her. On February 8, 1990, the girl's {{body was found in}} a field, close to the road, off County Road 1181, Ruggles Township in rural Ashland County, Ohio.|$|E
25|$|Epenow {{met with}} visiting Englishman Captain Thomas Dermer in 1619 in a {{peaceful}} meeting on Martha's Vineyard, and laughed <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> {{the story of his}} escape from captivity. But on Dermer's second visit in 1620, shortly before the arrival of the Mayflower, Epenow's warriors attacked the captain and his men, and took captive his traveling companion, the celebrated Squanto, before turning him over to Massasoit (the leading Wampanoag sachem). Some of Epenow's company were slain, but all but one of Dermer's crew were killed, and Dermer, severely wounded with fourteen wounds, escaped to Virginia where he died soon afterward.|$|E
25|$|With the Russians {{being pushed}} back from Poland, Kitchener thought the {{transfer}} of German troops west and a possible invasion of Britain increasingly likely, and told the War Council (14 May) {{that he was not}} willing to send the New Armies overseas. He wired French (16 May 1915) that he would send no more reinforcements to France until he was clear the German line could be broken, but sent two divisions at the end of May to please Joffre, not because he thought a breakthrough possible. He had wanted to conserve his New Armies to strike a knockout blow in 1916–17, but by the summer of 1915 realised that high casualties and a major commitment to France were inescapable. “Unfortunately we have to make war as we must, and not as we should like” <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> the Dardanelles Committee on 20 August 1915.|$|E

25|$|His {{opposition}} to the British peaked during the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. In 1937, evading an arrest warrant, he fled Palestine and took refuge successively in the French Mandate of Lebanon and the Kingdom of Iraq, until he established himself in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. During World War II he collaborated with both Italy and Germany by making propagandistic radio broadcasts and by helping the Nazis recruit Bosnian Muslims for the Waffen-SS (on the ground that they shared four principles: family, order, the leader and faith). Also, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> the recruits, Germany had not colonized any Arab country while Russia and England had. On meeting Adolf Hitler he requested backing for Arab independence and support in opposing the establishment in Palestine of a Jewish national home. At the war's end he came under French protection, and then sought refuge in Cairo to avoid prosecution for war crimes.|$|E
25|$|Later, American {{scientists}} {{outlined a}} theoretical attack against SIM cards used for GSM mobile phones. Together with hackers from the Chaos Computer Club, Floricic successfully created a working clone {{of such a}} SIM card, thus showing the practicability of the attack. He also engaged in cloning the German phonecard and succeeded. While Floricic only wanted to demonstrate the insecurity of the system, the proven insecurity was also abused by criminals {{which led to the}} attention of law enforcement agencies and the German national phone operator Deutsche Telekom. After Deutsche Telekom changed the system, Floricic tried to remove a complete public card phone from a booth by force (using a sledgehammer) on 3 March 1995 in order to, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>told,</b> adapt his phonecard simulators to the latest changes. He and a friend were, however, caught by the police upon this attempt. Floricic was later sentenced to a prison term of 15 months which was suspended to probation.|$|E

500|$|Van Morrison {{regarded}} Street Choir poorly, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> biographer Ritchie Yorke in 1973: [...] "Somewhere {{along the}} line I lost control of that album. I'd rather not think about that album because it doesn't mean much {{in terms of where}} I was at... the album didn't sell very well and I'm glad." [...] Morrison first lost control of the album before its release, when it was retitled from Virgo's Fool to His Band and the Street Choir: ...|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war, Wood {{received}} an offer by which he was seriously tempted: the Boston Symphony Orchestra invited him to become its musical director. He had been guest conductor of the Berlin and New York Philharmonic Orchestras, but he regarded the Boston orchestra as the finest in the world. Nonetheless, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Boult, [...] "it was hard to refuse, but I felt it was a patriotic duty to remain in my own country, at the present moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Because of his {{experience}} with the Specimens translations, Ripley was chosen to be {{the managing editor of}} the Transcendental publication The Dial at its inception, working alongside its first editor Margaret Fuller. In addition to overseeing distribution, subscriptions, printing, and finances, Ripley also contributed essays and reviews. In October 1841, he resigned his post with The Dial as he prepared for an experiment in communal living. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Emerson, although he was happy seeing all the Transcendental thoughts in print, he could not be truly happy [...] "without the attempt to realize them".|$|E

500|$|Synge later {{developed}} {{an interest in}} Irish antiquities and the Aran Islands, and {{became a member of}} the Irish League for a year. He left the League because, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Maud Gonne, [...] "my theory of regeneration for Ireland differs from yours... I wish to work on my own for the cause of Ireland, and I shall never be able to do so if I get mixed up with a revolutionary and semi-military movement." [...] In 1893 he published his first known work, a poem influenced by Wordsworth, Kottabos: A College Miscellany.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway asked Pound to blue-ink {{his short}} stories. Although Hemingway was 14 years younger, the two forged a lifelong {{relationship}} of mutual respect and friendship, {{living on the}} same street for a time, and touring Italy together in 1923. [...] "They liked each other personally, shared the same aesthetic aims, and admired each other's work", writes Hemingway biographer Jeffrey Meyers, with Hemingway assuming the status of pupil to Pound's teaching. Pound introduced Hemingway to Lewis, Ford, and Joyce, while Hemingway in turn tried to teach Pound to box, but <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Sherwood Anderson, [...] " [...] habitually leads with his chin and has the general grace of a crayfish or crawfish".|$|E
500|$|Other than in Picasso's {{exploration}} of the theme, the Crucifixion did not figure prominently in twentieth-century painting. The Surrealists exploited its shock value, and it {{was used as a}} vehicle for blasphemy in isolated instances. Bacon often expressed his admiration for the manner in which old masters such as Cimabue treated the Crucifixion; however, as with Picasso, he was more interested in tackling the subject from a secular, humanist point of view. For Three Studies, Bacon did not approach the Crucifixion as a Christian image per se, but rather found that the scene reflected a particular view of humanity he held. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> David Sylvester: [...] "it was just an act of man's behaviour, a way of behaviour to another." ...|$|E
