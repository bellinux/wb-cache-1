25|$|As John Curtis let {{his first}} pitch go, Munson broke for the plate. Michael tried to bunt, and missed. With Munson coming, the scrawny Yankees shortstop tried {{to step in}} Fisk's way, but Fisk elbowed {{him out of the}} way and braced for Munson, who crashed into him <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could. Fisk held onto the ball, but Munson tried to lie on top of him to allow Felipe Alou to keep {{rounding}} the bases.|$|E
25|$|The team {{suffered}} a serious blow when center fielder Adam Eaton, {{acquired in the}} off-season in a trade with the Chicago White Sox, stepped awkwardly on first base beating out an infield single {{in the ninth inning}} at Nationals Park against the Mets on April 28. Eaton had to be carried off the field, and an MRI showed he had torn his anterior cruciate ligament and knee meniscus and sprained his ankle. The injuries were expected to rule him out for the season, although Eaton said he would work <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could to return in time for the playoffs. The Nationals called up outfielder Rafael Bautista to replace Eaton on the active roster.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{controversial}} nature of the loss, Rahman's ranking did not suffer, but in November 1999, he was knocked out by Oleg Maskaev in the eighth round of a fight he looked to be winning. At one point during the match, Rahman was knocked through the ropes onto the floor, hitting {{his head on the}} floor. Rahman dropped out of The Ring top 10 {{as a result of the}} surprise loss. Rahman later said that he had seen Maskaev earlier in his career get knocked out in the first round by former champion Oliver McCall and he assumed he was brought in as an easy win. Because of this, he did not train <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> should have and was beaten.|$|E

25|$|After the Schism, around {{half of all}} the mutants on Utopia {{accompany}} Wolverine to Westchester {{to be a part of}} the new school. He appoints {{himself as}} the headmaster, Kitty Pryde as the co-headmistress, Hank McCoy as the vice-principal, and various other characters such as Rogue, Cannonball, Iceman, Rachel Grey, and Gambit are appointed as the school's staff. Toad is appointed as a janitor. The first issue focuses on the state education board visiting to approve of their school application. As Logan and Kitty give the delegation a tour, Kade Kilgore shows up and tells Logan that he is the one who caused the Schism and he will destroy all that Logan has worked to build up. Wolverine founded the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, spending all the fortune that he had amassed over the years upon it. On its first day it was assaulted by the new Hellfire Club, who had been a major force in causing the Schism of the X-Men. Wolverine made it clear that he didn't want to lose any of the kids and fought <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could against the Frankenstein Monsters whom Iceman defeated by making Ice clones of himself. Then, they were attacked by the Hellfire Club, who were in possession of a spawn of the original Krakoa.|$|E
500|$|On 18 June, after closing speeches from {{prosecution}} and defence counsels, the judge began his summing-up. While emphasising Thorpe's distinguished public record, he was scathing about the principal prosecution witnesses: Bessell was a [...] "humbug", Scott a fraud, a sponger, a whiner, a parasite—"but {{of course he}} could still be telling the truth." [...] Newton was [...] "determined to milk the case <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> can." [...] On 20 June the jury retired; they returned two days later and acquitted the four defendants on all charges. In a brief public statement, Thorpe said that he considered the verdict [...] "a complete vindication." [...] Scott said he was [...] "unsurprised" [...] by the outcome, but was upset by the aspersions on his character made by the judge {{from the safety of}} the bench.|$|E
500|$|The benchings did {{not produce}} the desired results, however, as the Capitals lost six of eight games, with Ovechkin scoring only one goal during the same stretch. As a result, Washington fired Boudreau on November 28 and {{replaced}} him with former Capitals captain Dale Hunter. Hunter was the {{head coach of the}} Ontario Hockey League's (OHL) London Knights when he was hired. During his time with London, he set an OHL record for fastest coach to 300 and 400 career wins. The Capitals lost Hunter's coaching debut 2–1 to the St. Louis Blues. The following day, Boudreau spoke to the media about being fired, stating that General Manager George McPhee made the [...] "right decision at the time" [...] and that despite speculation, he did not feel that Ovechkin was a problem, stating that he [...] "worked as hard and tried <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 200-meter {{butterfly}} semi-finals, Tarwater {{turned in}} the second-fastest time behind Bobby Bollier as Phelps conserved energy. In the finals the next day, Tarwater, knowing he was facing several strong finishers, decided to go out <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could and try to build a big enough lead to hold on. Tarwater led {{the field for the}} first 100 meters. [...] Phelps passed him in the third 50-meter stretch, but Tarwater held off {{the rest of the field}} until the final 25 meters when both Bollier and Tyler Clary surged ahead, dropping Tarwater to fourth. His split on the final 50 meters was three seconds slower than his third 50, and two seconds slower than his final lap in 2008. A couple days later, Tarwater advanced to the 100-meter butterfly final, but finished fifth. [...] Afterwards, he called it [...] "the last race I'll ever swim." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sinking of}} the RMS Lusitania in 1915 created a wave of anti-German sentiment, and Gruban worried that he would find it {{difficult}} to find government work because of his nationality and thick German accent. He again contacted Booth, who again claimed to be friends with David Lloyd George and his secretary, Christopher Addison, and said that if Gruban put Booth on the Board of Directors he could [...] "do with the Ministry of Munitions what I like". Gruban immediately made Booth the chairman of his company, and over 3 months took £400 on expenses. He then claimed that this was not enough money for the work he did, and he should get a secret payment of 10% of the value of a contract known as the [...] "Birmingham Contract". The contract was worth £6,000, and Booth wrote a memo saying that he should have £580 or £600. Gruban refused, and Booth threw the note in the wastepaper basket. From that point onwards Booth worked <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could to undermine Gruban's position, while outwardly appearing to be his friend.|$|E
500|$|On 18 June {{the judge}} began his summing-up. He drew the jury's {{attention}} to the previous good character of the defendants, whom he characterised as [...] "men of hitherto unblemished reputation." [...] Cantley described Thorpe as [...] "a national figure with a very distinguished public record". The judge was scathing about the principal witnesses: Bessell was a [...] "humbug" [...] whose contract with The Sunday Telegraph was [...] "deplorable"; Scott was a fraud, a sponger, a whiner, a parasite—"but of course he could still be telling the truth. It {{is a question of}} belief." [...] Newton was characterised as a perjurer and a chump, [...] "determined to milk the case <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> can." [...] The mystery surrounding the £20,000 that Thorpe had obtained from Hayward was dismissed as an irrelevance: [...] "The fact that a man obtains money by deceit does not [...] that the man {{was a member of a}} conspiracy." [...] Waugh felt that the judge's lack of even-handedness could well provoke a counteraction against the accused from the jury. The summing-up became the subject of a scathing parody by the satirist Peter Cook, written and delivered shortly after the trial at The Secret Policeman's Ball in aid of Amnesty International. Cook's version, according to Freeman and Penrose, was [...] "actually not that different from the original." ...|$|E

500|$|The next {{race was}} the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Because many leading older horses retired in 2014, {{most of the}} main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds: in {{addition}} to California Chrome, former foes Bayern, Candy Boy and Tonalist entered. His chief rival {{was considered to be}} the then-undefeated American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Shared Belief, a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems; the two had never faced each other. California Chrome was 4-1 on the morning line, second favorite to Shared Belief. In the race, Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start, then took the lead {{for the duration of the}} race. California Chrome was clear of traffic, maintained third place for most of the race, was closing at the end, and finished a very close third, only a neck behind winner Bayern, who won by a nose over second-place finisher Toast of New York. Shared Belief was fourth. Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race, and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner. [...] Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse's finish, stating, [...] "My horse ran his eyeballs out. He was right there, right down to the money. I thought it was a great effort. He came back strong." [...] Espinoza was less enthusiastic: [...] "On the backstretch I thought I had a chance to win... The last sixteenth [...] was digging <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, but getting just a little tired. I wish he had one more race. It was a little too much for him today." [...] Coburn visited the colt the following day and stated, [...] "He was full of himself. I think he thought he won. And if the race had been just a little bit longer, I believe he would have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Teachers {{also showed}} some sympathy for McInerney. [...] "We failed Brandon," [...] a teacher said. [...] "We didn't know the {{bullying}} {{was coming from}} the other side—Larry was pushing <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, because he liked the attention." [...] Hundreds of children from the school have signed a petition requesting that McInerney be tried as a juvenile.|$|E

2500|$|By {{late fall}} {{his team was}} playing well against major Negro league teams. On September 22, 1939, {{in the second game}} of a double-header against the {{powerful}} American Giants, Paige won a 1–0 game, striking out 10 men in the seven innings before the game was called on account of darkness. Buck O'Neil, who had batted against Paige in 1935 and 1936 and faced him again in a game against the parent Monarchs, recalled a dropoff in speed but an improvement in deception. [...] "He could still throw hard. Not <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had thrown, but you're talkin' about somebody thrown' ninety-eight, a hundred miles an hour. But now he's throwin' maybe ninety—which is still more than the average guy... He was the best and, actually, he was so deceptive!
