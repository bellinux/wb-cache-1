Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid. The inclusion of antimony, polonium, and astatine as metalloids also has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, it was {{proposed}} to list Loring on the Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List. This {{was due to}} the presence of waste oil, fuel, solvents, and pesticides in the soil. Additionally, the burning of waste also created problems, in addition to the use of landfills in old gravel pits on site. The fire training area also needed clean up, as materials were burned until 1974 on that site. Loring was officially <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> in February 1990.|$|E

Gaining compensation changed some families, whose members began to fight among themselves. Some descendants refused it, while others went into hiding to avoid the press of friends and relatives who came asking for handouts. Some descendants, after dividing the funds among siblings, received not much more than $100 each. Later, the Florida Department of Education set up the Rosewood Family Scholarship Fund for Rosewood descendants and ethnic minorities.|$|E
5|$|The {{stopping}} {{patterns on}} the Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line have generally been determined by several different termini. The steam era saw these termini change quite frequently as more terminating facilities were constructed: the first trains on the line after the Waterfall extension in 1887 either ran to Hurstville (16 per day), Sutherland (two per day) and Waterfall (two per day), with all trains stopping at every intermediate station. By 1907, however, Como and Oatley had been <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of termini, with nine and seven trains per day respectively. Seven trains per day at this time also ran to Sutherland, and one to Waterfall. Most trains terminated at Hurstville.|$|E

5|$|The testimonies of explorers {{and colonial}} administrators {{demonstrate}} that Carabane {{has participated in}} rice cultivation, fishery, trade, and palm wine production for a long time. The rice cycle plays a central economic and religious role {{in the lives of}} the population. Palm oil and palm wine are very popular and traditional in the area. The fishery has long been dominated by artisan fishing, which supplies the daily needs of the island's population; however, broader economic possibilities have been exploited since the early 20th century. Although there have been attempts to cultivate a tourism industry on the island, the inhabitants have been reluctant to participate. Carabane was <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of historic sites and monuments of Senegal in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Shanshan, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Luis, was a strong typhoon that {{affected}} parts of East Asia in late September 2006. The 13th named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season, Typhoon Shanshan was also the seventh typhoon of the year operationally recognised by the Japan Meteorological Agency. In post-operational analysis Shanshan became the eighth typhoon {{of the year when}} Typhoon Maria was <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>list.</b> The Joint Typhoon Warning Center considered Shanshan the 13th tropical storm and eighth typhoon of the season, a Category 4-equivalent typhoon in terms of 1-minute average wind speed. The name Shanshan was submitted to the naming list by Hong Kong and is a girls' given name.|$|E
5|$|A Microsoft Windows {{version of}} the game, ported by Demiurge Studios, was {{released}} on May 28, 2008. This version features optimized controls designed specifically for personal computers, high resolution graphics, a new user interface, and other minor changes. BioWare initially intended to use SecuROM, a digital rights management software which would require online activation after installation and additional authentication checks every ten days. However, the company ultimately decided not to use it after listening to criticism from fans. In 2012, {{five years after the}} release of the original Xbox 360 version, Mass Effect was ported to Sony's PlayStation 3 console by Edge of Reality, featuring some lighting and visual effects improvements. It was released digitally on the PlayStation Network and as part of the Mass Effect Trilogy compilation. In 2015, Mass Effect was <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of backward compatible Xbox 360 games on Xbox One.|$|E

5|$|All three {{consoles}} provide titles {{from older}} consoles for download; the Xbox 360 through the Xbox Originals service, the PlayStation 3 through the PlayStation Store, and the Wii through the Virtual Console. When purchased, {{the game is}} saved to console's internal memory or, optionally on the Wii, to an inserted SD/SDHC card. Initially the Xbox 360 also provided Xbox Live support for backwards compatible games, but the service has since been discontinued for original Xbox games. No more games will be <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of backwards compatible games for the Xbox 360. In response {{to the lack of}} backward compatibility for most PS3s, many popular games have been released for download as PlayStation 2 Classics and other popular series have been updated with gameplay/graphics as high-definition remasters for PlayStation consoles and have been released on Blu-ray Disc or are available for download on the PlayStation Network.|$|E
5|$|An embargo is not {{the same}} as Food Power, however, food power can be used in an embargo. In fact, embargoes that do not involve food in their list of {{restricted}} items often fail. For example, on August 20, 1914 the Allied Powers began an embargo on important items that were normally shipped to Germany. However, the embargo was not complete nor effective until food was <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of restricted materials. Food has the real power. After food was introduced the blockade began to strangle Germany's economy because they were dependent on imports for food. Because the Allied Powers used the power of food in their embargo, Germany was forced to resort to desperate measures and eventually failed despite them.|$|E

Beginning on January 4, 2008, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) conducted an 18-month study on Woodhaven Boulevard {{as part of the}} city's Congested Corridors Project to improve congested and dangerous roadways. One of the short-term recommendations {{of the study was to}} implement bus rapid transit along the corridor.

5|$|Later in the game, non-rotatable gems can be found, and {{the player}} is punished for {{rotations}} {{that do not}} lead to a match by having the enemy's gauge fill faster. The amount of damage that the player can take or deliver is dependent on the monster used in battle, and using a beast in battle earns experience points which can increase the power of that summon. Each monster has a corresponding color, and matching gems that are the same color as your chosen monster or the enemy makes your gauge fill faster or theirs slower. Enemy monsters can change gems on the board to skulls, which cause damage to the player if they are not lined up within a certain number of moves. After being defeated in a battle, enemy monsters are <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of creatures that the player chooses from when they start a stage. New monsters can also be found hidden in the stages, along with items that can be used during battles.|$|E
5|$|On August28, {{or about}} three days after Katrina struck the state, President George W.
