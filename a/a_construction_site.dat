5|$|One {{person was}} killed and another was injured in Taipei after a 20m (65ft) high {{scaffolding}} in <b>a</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> collapsed. At least 495mm (19in) of rain fell {{in the mountains of}} Taiwan, triggering flooding which damaged about 24hectares of crops, leaving NT$7.8million (US$236,300) in losses. A total of 8,795 residences were left without power {{at the height of the}} storm. Several roads and bridges were also washed out from flooding. Officials in Taiwan recorded 29 landslides, mostly in northern areas, and urged residents to evacuate due to the possibility of more.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, an {{overpass}} {{being built}} at MD198 over the B–W Parkway {{just east of}} Laurel collapsed during rush hour, injuring fourteen motorists and construction workers. The incident was blamed on faulty scaffolding used to support the uncompleted span. On July 9, 2005, a sinkhole opened beneath the parkway at <b>a</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site,</b> leading to the complete closure of the northbound roadway. The sinkhole was filled with concrete {{to shore up the}} roadbed and prevent further collapse; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers attempted to expedite repairs, but the route remained closed until the next day. On August 24, 2007, both directions of the parkway were closed when chunks of concrete fell from the overpass at MD193 (Greenbelt Road) onto the northbound lanes.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a young Native American man {{is forced}} by several others to ingest snake venom. The venom causes him to hallucinate, {{and one of}} the men, Joe Reynard (Michael Greyeyes) asks him to {{describe}} his visions. However, the poisoned man screams in agony and dies. His body is later found when <b>a</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> is being excavated by archaeologists. A mummified body from centuries earlier is also found; when Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) arrives to investigate, he notices similarities between both corpses. The archaeologist in charge of the dig, Liz Michaels (Amy Steel) is adamant that the site should stay intact for further excavation, but foreman Richard Powell (Garry Chalk) and his mostly Native American crew insist building must continue.|$|E
5|$|In the present, Black {{realizes that}} the current murderer must be Hance's former cellmate Jacob Tyler (Scott Heindl). Black visits Hance in prison, and upon {{speaking}} to Hance, realizes that Tyler believes himself Hance's reincarnation, aspiring to follow his methods exactly. Meanwhile, Tyler calls the police and leaves an anonymous tip, telling them that the liquor store murderer is hiding in an abandoned building. Black accompanies a SWAT team encircling the building, but the officers come under sniper fire from <b>a</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> across the street. Black and Bletcher separate as they search for Tyler, who gets the drop on Black. Black disarms Tyler, attempting to talk him into surrendering. Tyler empties a handgun at Black, but misses; when Bletcher confronts him, Tyler points the gun and Bletcher instinctively shoots and kills him.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is divided}} into four {{different}} single-screen stages. Each represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed, one stage being 25 meters higher than the previous. The final stage occurs at 100 meters. Stage one involves Mario scaling <b>a</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> made of crooked girders and ladders while jumping over or hammering barrels and oil drums tossed by Donkey Kong. Stage two involves climbing a five-story structure of conveyor belts, each of which transport cement pans. The third stage involves the player riding elevators while avoiding bouncing springs. The final stage involves Mario removing eight rivets which support Donkey Kong. Removing the final rivet causes Donkey Kong to fall and the hero {{to be reunited with}} Pauline. These four stages combine to form a level.|$|E
5|$|While at the station, Max overhears his new partner, Valerie Winterson, {{talking on}} the phone about Mona. Suddenly, the station is {{attacked}} by the Cleaners, who are looking for Mona. Mona breaks out of her cell, and after fighting off the Cleaners, Max and Mona begin hunting down the people responsible for the attack. Their search leads them to <b>a</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site,</b> where he and Mona defend themselves against the Cleaners. After their foes leave, Winterson arrives and holds Mona at gunpoint. Mona claims that Winterson is there to kill her, while Winterson claims that she is simply trying to arrest a fleeing fugitive. After several moments of consideration, Max fatally shoots Winterson, allowing Mona to escape. Before she dies, Winterson shoots Max, hospitalizing him.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong is {{the first}} example of a {{complete}} narrative told in video game form, and like 1980's Pac-Man, it employs cutscenes to advance its plot. The game opens with the gorilla climbing a pair of ladders {{to the top of}} <b>a</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site.</b> He sets Pauline down and stomps his feet, causing the steel beams to change shape. He then moves to his final perch and sneers. This brief animation sets the scene and adds background to the gameplay, a first for video games. Upon reaching the end of the stage, another cutscene begins. A heart appears between Mario and Pauline, but Donkey Kong grabs the woman and climbs higher, causing the heart to break. The narrative concludes when Mario reaches the end of the rivet stage. He and Pauline are reunited, and a short intermission plays. The gameplay then loops from the beginning at a higher level of difficulty, without any formal ending.|$|E

5|$|From Chicago, Bundy {{traveled}} by train to Ann Arbor, Michigan. There, on January 2 {{in a local}} tavern, he watched his alma mater UW defeat Michigan in the Rose Bowl. Five days later he stole a car and drove to Atlanta, where he boarded a bus and arrived in Tallahassee, Florida, {{on the morning of}} January 8. He rented a room under the alias Chris Hagen at a boarding house near the Florida State University (FSU) campus. Bundy later said that he initially resolved to find legitimate employment and refrain from further criminal activity, knowing he could probably remain free and undetected in Florida indefinitely as long as he did not attract the attention of police; but his lone job application, at <b>a</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site,</b> had to be abandoned when he was asked to produce identification. He reverted to his old habits of shoplifting and stealing credit cards from women's wallets left in shopping carts.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball is a part-basketball, part-puzzler shot-matching sports {{video game}} where players flick {{basketballs}} through 2D physics puzzles (with flippers, portals, circular saw blades, and gravity switches) into a basketball hoop. Some puzzles include banking the basketball shot off multiple surfaces {{before making the}} basket. In the HORSE-style games, the player must match the exact setup of the opponent's shot, such as hitting the floor before entering the hoop. In the campaign, players get more points for making the shot without retrying, and have five attempts to make the hoop {{before moving to the}} next level shamefully. Players are awarded medals for the quality of their performance {{at the end of each}} chapter. Gold medals unlock new modes of play in the chapter. Every chapter has a unique theme, such as <b>a</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> or outer space.|$|E
5|$|Hardee {{regularly}} {{appeared in}} his own shows at the Edinburgh Fringe. The Greatest Show on Legs debuted there in 1982. Arguably his most infamous confirmed stunt there was in 1983 when, performing at The Circuit venue – {{a series of three}} adjoining tents in <b>a</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> with a different show in each tent – he became annoyed by what he regarded as excessive noise emanating nightly from Eric Bogosian's neighbouring performance tent. Hardee obtained a nearby tractor and, entirely naked, drove it across Bogosian's stage during his performance. Rivalling this stunt in Fringe infamy, in 1989, Hardee and Arthur Smith wrote a rave 5-star review of Hardee's own Fringe show and successfully managed to get it printed in The Scotsman under the byline of the influential newspaper's comedy critic. At the Fringe in 1996, The Independent reported that he attempted to sabotage American ventriloquist David Strassman's Edinburgh show by abducting the act's hi-tech dummy, holding it to ransom and sending it back to Strassman piece by piece in return for hard cash. The plan failed.|$|E

5|$|Only a few {{towns in}} western Libya—such as Bani Walid, Sebha and Sirte—remained Gaddafist strongholds. Retreating to Sirte after Tripoli's fall, Gaddafi {{announced}} {{his willingness to}} negotiate for a handover to a transitional government, a suggestion rejected by the NTC. Surrounding himself with bodyguards, he continually moved residences to escape NTC shelling, devoting his days to prayer and reading the Qur'an. On 20 October, Gaddafi broke out of Sirte's District 2 in a joint civilian-military convoy, hoping to take refuge in the Jarref Valley. At around 8.30am, NATO bombers attacked, destroying at least 14 vehicles and killing at least 53. The convoy scattered, and Gaddafi and those closest to him fled to a nearby villa, which was shelled by rebel militia from Misrata. Fleeing to <b>a</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site,</b> Gaddafi and his inner cohort hid inside drainage pipes while his bodyguards battled the rebels; in the conflict, Gaddafi suffered head injuries from a grenade blast while defence minister Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr was killed.|$|E
5|$|The Arkham Knight {{activates}} the Cloudburst, {{flooding the}} city with fear toxin. Batman destroys the Cloudburst and convinces Ivy to empower an ancient tree that can neutralize the toxin; she succeeds and saves Gotham, but the strain kills her, while Batman's exposure to the toxin strengthens Joker's control. Batman pursues the Arkham Knight to <b>a</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> to rescue Gordon. The Knight reveals himself as Jason Todd, the previous Robin, who was seemingly murdered by the Joker, and has been left traumatized by torture at the Joker's hands. Todd blames Batman for abandoning him, and although Batman offers to help Todd recover, he escapes. Batman and Gordon confront Scarecrow on the building's roof, where Oracle is revealed to be alive, and her suicide {{the result of a}} hallucination. Batman rescues Oracle and returns her to the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD), but Scarecrow escapes with Gordon. Using the remaining militia, Scarecrow assaults the GCPD to eliminate Batman's allies. Batman and Oracle neutralize the militia, but Scarecrow uses the distraction to kidnap Robin.|$|E
5|$|The two try to {{convince}} Sheila to stop the projection, but as she is inexperienced with the device, she instead ends up projecting Steiner to somewhere else. He ends up at <b>a</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site,</b> the hideout of a band of thieves who are attempting to break into a bank. It is learned that an error in the projection has given Steiner the ability to kill people by touching them, and has mutilated one half of his body. Steiner kills the criminals, and then enters a store, where he steals a pair of rubber gloves and a coat. He then breaks into the institute, where he finds Latham and kills him. He also destroys the building's power supply, alerting Hill and Mitchell that something is wrong. By this time, Inspector Davis (Derek Farr) has discovered {{the bodies of the}} criminals and is determined to stop Steiner.|$|E
