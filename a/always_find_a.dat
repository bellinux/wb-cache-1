25|$|Toroidal groups play an {{important}} part in the theory of compact Lie groups. This {{is due in part to}} the fact that in any compact Lie group G one can <b>always</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> maximal torus; that is, a closed subgroup which is a torus of the largest possible dimension. Such maximal tori T have a controlling role to play in theory of connected G. Toroidal groups are examples of protori, which (like tori) are compact connected abelian groups, which are not required to be manifolds.|$|E
25|$|Any n-vertex forest has pathwidth O(logn).(2n+1) on the pathwidth of an n-vertex forest. For, in a forest, one can <b>always</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> {{constant}} {{number of}} vertices {{the removal of}} which leaves a forest that can be partitioned into two smaller subforests with at most 2n/3 vertices each. A linear arrangement formed by recursively partitioning each of these two subforests, placing the separating vertices between them, has logarithmic vertex searching number. The same technique, applied to a tree-decomposition of a graph, shows that, if the treewidth of an n-vertex graph G is t, then the pathwidth of G is O(tlogn). Since outerplanar graphs, series-parallel graphs, and Halin graphs all have bounded treewidth, they all also have at most logarithmic pathwidth.|$|E

2500|$|As Commandant {{during the}} Prohibition Era, Billard {{established}} the Coast Guard's first intelligence center, designed to collect, evaluate, and disseminate {{information relating to}} smuggling practices and plans. The use of radio codes increased by both the service and the smugglers so the Coast Guard had to develop cryptanalysis skills to keep ahead of the smugglers. [...] Radio direction finding equipment was installed on several Coast Guard vessels in late 1930. The original twenty destroyers were ending their expected service lives by 1930 and were replaced by newer craft that had been requested in 1926. Billard first used borrowed Navy aircraft in 1925 to track smugglers; this proved successful and in his 1926 budget requests he included the need for five aircraft {{at a cost of}} $152,000. With each improvement in detection and method of interdiction that the Coast Guard introduced, the smugglers would <b>always</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> different method of introducing contraband into the United States. Billard was concerned that Coast Guardsmen would succumb to enticements offered by the rum runners through either offers of liquor or cash, and there were several instances of this happening. Some service personnel were convicted at courts-martial of accepting bribes or improperly assisting liquor smugglers.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the late}} 1920s and 1930s onward, {{classical}} revolutionary orthodox Marxists like Henryk Grossmann, Louis C. Fraina (alias Lewis Corey) and Paul Mattick [...] argued {{that at a}} certain point, the falling rate of profit stops the total mass of profit in the economy from growing altogether, or at least from growing at a sufficient rate. This results in a crisis of overaccumulation (or a shortage of surplus value), and consequently a drop in new productive investment, causing an increase in unemployment. This, in turn, leads to a wave of takeovers and mergers to restore profitable production, plus a higher intensity of labor exploitation. In the end, however, {{after a lot of}} cycles, capitalism collapses. This contrasted with V.I. Lenin’s idea that in the crises of bourgeois society [...] "there {{is no such thing as}} an absolutely hopeless situation", since the bourgeoisie can – in principle – <b>always</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way out. Lenin regarded the abolition of capitalism as a conscious political act, not as a spontaneous result of the breakdown of the economy. In 1931, two years after publishing his breakdown theory, Grossman qualified his idea more, emphasizing that he did not believe that capitalism had to collapse [...] "by itself" [...] or [...] "automatically"; the objective law of breakdown had to be combined with the subjective factor of the class struggle.|$|E
