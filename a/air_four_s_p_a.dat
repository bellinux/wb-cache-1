The morphological {{details of the}} Ia axon-motoneurone connexion involved in generating each e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> were subsequently reconstructed, as described by Redman & Walmsley (1983).

The second order results obtained by Y. B. Band (Phys. Rev. 13 (1976) 2061) have been generalized by taking into account the energy separations between the levels. This has lead to a supplementary tilt angle dependent term which is linear in the electric field and the energy differences.

40|$|The {{balance between}} {{proliferation}} and apoptosis plays {{a crucial role}} in the maintenance of epidermal homeostasis. As hyperproliferative skin diseases such as psoriasis vularis are characterized through dysregulated cell growth and survival, it was of great interest to evaluate the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis in human keratinocytes. The lysophospholipid sphingosin 1 -phosphate (<b>S</b> 1 <b>P),</b> for long time considered only as a structural component of the membrane bilayer, has been identified as an interesting lipid mediator showing cellular effects comparable to those of growth factors. Hence, <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> influences a variety of biological processes, including angiogenesis, cell motility, cell survival and reorganisation of the cytoskeleton. Moreover, this lysophospholipid regulates cellular signaling in the skin. Antiproliferative and antiapoptotic effects have been described in human keratinocytes, but the underlying signaling pathways have never been characterized. The serine threonine kinase Akt has been identified as a major regulator of keratinocyte growth. The present study reveals that the growth inhibitory effect of <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> is mediated through an inhibition of Akt activity. In this study, a previously unreported interplay between <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> and insulin-mediated signaling pathways was identified, which is of great interest as epidermal hyperproliferation is associated with a strong induction of insulin-mediated signal transduction pathways. Most interestingly, the inhibition of insulin-induced Akt activity is mediated through protein kinase C (PKC) delta activation. <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> mediates most of its action via transmembrane G protein coupled receptors <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> 1 - 5. This study identified the <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> 2 receptor as the crucial receptor subtype for inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. Moreover, the <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> 2 receptor subtype transduced the activation of PKC delta, dephosphorylation of Akt and subsequent inhibition of insulin-induced keratinocyte growth. Phosphorylated FTY 720 acts as potent agonist on <b>four</b> <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> receptors showing no agonistic activity at the <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> 2 receptor subtype. Therefore FTY 720 -P failed to suppress insulin-mediated Akt phosphorylation and subsequent proliferation of human keratinocytes. The present study identifies an interplay between insulin and <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> on Akt signaling leading not only to the described inhibition of insulin-induced cell growth, but also to a modulation of the antiapoptotic action of insulin. As Akt {{plays a crucial role}} in antiapoptotic signaling, the effect of <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> on insulin-mediated cytoprotection was evaluated. Indeed, dephosphorylation of Akt through <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> also reduced the antiapoptotic effect of insulin. This interplay`s effect on cytoprotective signaling was also mediated through the <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> 2 receptor subtype. <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> mediates antiapoptotic signaling via distinct, Akt-independent transduction pathways. Characterization of the signaling pathways transducing the antiapoptotic effect of <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> revealed an involvement of the <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> 3 receptor. Moreover, the present study shows that the antiapoptotic effect of <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> was NO dependent via eNOS activation...|$|R

E. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> (n = 80) of different sizes (30 - 1040 microV) and rise times (1. 1 - 8. 2 ms) were investigated in fifty-nine motoneurones. The majority of the e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> were recorded in triceps surae-plantaris motoneurones with high levels of synaptic noise (estimated peak-to-peak fluctuations of 1. 5 - 3. 5 mV). This noise was generated by keeping the triceps surae-plantaris muscles stretched to a near maximal degree. The remaining e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> were recorded in motoneurones to other hind-limb muscles with a low level of synaptic noise. The height of the primary peak of the correlogram with respect to base-line firing rate increased in proportion to both amplitude and rising slope of the e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> Using normalization procedures or using e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> of constant amplitude but different slopes and vice versa, the relative peak height increased with e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> peak derivative with a slope of around 6 /mV per millisecond and with e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p</b> peak amplitude with a slope of about 1 /mV. The shape of the correlogram (peak and trough) seemed well described by a linear combination of the shape of the e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> derivative and that of the e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> itself. The relative e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> contribution (e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> :e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> derivative ratio) varied with e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> amplitude and noise level, being largest (mostly 0. 25 - 1. 0) for small e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> (100 - 300 microV) in high levels of synaptic noise and smaller (0 - 0. 25) for larger e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> and for e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> in a low noise background. In conformity with the above finding, a leaky integration of the correlograms gave time courses that in most cases closely resembled the shape of the e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> The time constant of the leaky circuit (= inverse value of e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> :e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> derivative ratio) varied with e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> amplitude and noise level {{in the same manner as}} obtained by direct fitting of e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> and e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> derivative shape to correlogram shape.

However, {{little is known}} of their expression during embryonal development. We performed Northern blot analyses in mouse embryonal tissue and found that such expression is developmentally regulated. We also examined the expression of these receptors during primitive endoderm (PrE) differentiation of mouse F 9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, a well-known in vitro endoderm differentiation system. <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> 2 mRNA was abundantly {{expressed in}} F 9 EC cells, but little <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> 1 and no <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> 3, <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> 4, or <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> 5 mRNA was detectable. However, <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> 1 mRNA expression was induced during EC-to-PrE differentiation. Studies using small interference RNA of <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> 1 indicated that increased <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> 1 expression is required for PrE differentiation. Thus, <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> 1 may play an important function in PrE differentiation that is not substituted for by <b>S</b> 1 <b>P</b> 2.

We consider maximal irreducible closed subsets W ⊂ H <b>S</b> <b>P</b> 3 whose general member C {{is contained in}} a smooth cubic surface and investigate the conditions for W to be a component of (H <b>S</b> <b>P</b> 3) red. We especially study the case where the dimension of the tangent space of H <b>S</b> <b>P</b> 3 at [C] is greater than dimW (≥ 4 deg(C)) by one.
