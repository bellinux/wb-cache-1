500|$|Some critics {{disliked the}} unusual design, however, and criticized the {{reliance}} on triangles throughout the building. Others took issue with the large main lobby, particularly its attempt to lure casual visitors. In his review for Artforum, critic Richard Hennessy described a [...] "shocking fun-house atmosphere" [...] and [...] "aura of ancient Roman patronage". One of the earliest and most vocal critics, however, came to appreciate the new gallery once he saw it in person. Allan Greenberg had scorned the design {{when it was first}} unveiled, but wrote later to J. Carter Brown: [...] "I am forced to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are right and I was wrong! The building is a masterpiece." ...|$|E
60|$|L. They will {{at least}} <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have minds to change, Dora.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jimmy, I've been {{thinking}} it over. There's something I {{want to ask}} you. Do you <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> behaved abominably five years ago?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I.--It must be <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have carried}} the talent of [...] playing the madman, and of self-debasement, {{as far as}} it can [...] {{possibly}} be carried.|$|R
6000|$|Deringham {{was silent}} almost a minute, for {{he knew his}} {{opponent}} had seen the weak point. Then he said, [...] "If I <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were right?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not very}} much astonished," [...] Mr. Oliver {{answered}} with a soft laugh. [...] "Still, I don't mind <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> stood up to your work to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have told}} me a rather likely tale. As you don't speak of having been in India, who gave you the information?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, aunt, {{that will}} be quite unnecessary. I will always <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> did {{everything}} in your power to--to--to--make me run straight, as the sporting men say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have told}} me a rather likely tale. As you don't speak of having been in India, may I ask who gave you the information?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Grace smiled. [...] "That {{means you}} {{helped him to}} get away. Are <b>you</b> wise in <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were an accessory? Captain Esmond {{is a friend of}} ours." ...|$|R
60|$|LESLIE. <b>Admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{know more}} of life, sir; <b>admitted</b> (if <b>you</b> please) <b>that</b> {{the world is}} wicked; yet you do not lose trust in those you love.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're rating me too highly," [...] she {{answered}} with some embarrassment. [...] "You <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> thought my place was here--the inference was that I shouldn't {{fit into a}} different one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{advise you}} not to," [...] said Elinor. [...] "If you succeed, {{no one will}} <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have done anything; and if you fail, {{everybody}} will blame you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then there's {{nothing more}} to be said; but I suppose I must <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> meant well," [...] she answered, and giving him a level glance moved to the door.|$|E
6000|$|This {{appeared}} in particular more than Waymarsh could bear. [...] "He ought {{then to be}} ashamed of himself, and, as you <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> think so too, why drag him in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even Spike <b>admits</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{are what}} he calls `a prime seaman.' But {{it is not easy}} for a woman to get a correct {{knowledge}} of the use of all the strange, and sometimes uncouth, terms <b>that</b> <b>you</b> sailors use." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll let it pass," [...] he said. [...] "I don't mind <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{were correct}} in your surmise. The thing turned upon my vote and I gave it against your scheme. What follows?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True, Dora, true. Be not indignant. I have <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> may be right. Our detective {{will soon}} find out. He has the calm, self-confident, {{penetrating}} {{look of a}} man who could, if possible, screw something out of nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no {{question}} of odds, I think," [...] Bernadine answered smoothly. [...] "You are much too clever a person to refuse to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are entirely in my power." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered, [...] "not {{about your}} book, but about meaner things. What else {{could have made}} you {{dislocate}} your ankle rather than <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had been rather silly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{the first}} time I ever heard ye <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> comed after anybody," [...] {{answered}} Muggins with a grin; [...] "ye ginerally go before us all-- at least ye want to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jimmy," [...] she said, {{while he}} stood silent, [...] "would it hurt {{you very much}} if I <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were right, and sent you away? After all, you have {{scarcely}} said anything that could make one think you would feel it very keenly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've said it! You've said it!" [...] the Tory cur {{cried as}} if in delight. [...] "You've <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are rebels, and the king's {{officers}} shall hear of what you say, for {{the time has come}} when they are marking such as you for future punishment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mrs. Hatherly. [...] "At least, not exactly. He only <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> did {{not seem}} very pleased to see him. Still, I am an old woman, and that {{naturally}} conveyed a good deal to me. Perhaps you do deserve shaking, but I want to be kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he began, [...] "I'll <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{can shoot}} and sail a boat rather better than I can, but that doesn't entitle {{you to talk}} as you did just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Like me, you {{are going}} to say," [...] said Fanny, laughing. [...] "Well, I'll <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are right. It would be a pity that you should not have one vote, at least." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, Griffith," [...] he said triumphantly, {{when he had}} finished, [...] "if you are {{not ready}} to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are the most obstinate, pig-headed fellow that ever lived, I give you up altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What can we do?" [...] he asked. [...] "You have <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> love me. <b>You</b> know <b>that</b> I love you; but I do {{not know}} the ethics of society by which you are governed. I shall leave the {{decision}} to you, for you know best what will be for your eventual welfare." ...|$|R
5000|$|Liu Chong was a false emperor, and {{he lacked}} virtues and thus could not {{suppress}} evil. Now, {{we have a}} holy emperor, whose virtues are sufficient to suppress evil. In ancient days, if there were virtuous local officials, locusts would not enter their territory. If just enhancing virtues would be sufficient to eliminate locusts, are <b>you</b> <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are without virtues? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] {{the captain}} said, [...] "even <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have had some}} luck, there is no {{question}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have utilized your opportunities and have an extraordinary record, and if you don't get shot I prophesy <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will be an admiral before many officers old enough to be your father. Now, I am sure you must be anxious to get on board your prize as soon as possible, so we will take you to her at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|Walters {{broke off}} {{and looked at}} his {{companion}} with appeal. [...] "I've been talking too freely; said more than I should have done, in fact. You had better <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't find all this interesting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I never {{believed}} I'd be friendly {{with one of}} the capitalists," [...] Una was saying at their dinner, [...] "but I must <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't seem to want to grind the faces of the poor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{imagined}} so," [...] I answered. [...] "Perhaps {{you will}} <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> owe me some explanation." [...] He laughed, a deep bass laugh, {{and looked down}} at me with a gleam of humour in his black eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "You must <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> while <b>you</b> lived {{you had a}} {{first-class}} time under my protection. Lots of turnips to eat and so forth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{probably}} have to," [...] said Austin, a trifle drily. [...] "I don't mind <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> what <b>you</b> have suggested {{is a great}} relief to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mind you, I don't {{mean that}} Myra was merely flippant and worthless. Not at all. She {{was a girl}} with any amount of talent. You should have heard her recite [...] "The Raven," [...] at the Methodist Social! Simply genius! And when she acted Portia in the Trial Scene of the Merchant of Venice at the High School concert, {{everybody}} in Mariposa <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> couldn't have told it from the original.|$|R
