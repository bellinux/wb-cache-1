25|$|On 27 December, nine {{companies}} of the One Hundred and Twenty-second, nine {{companies of}} Thirty-ninth Iowa Infantry, Fiftieth Indiana Infantry, {{and a part}} of Seventh Wisconsin Battery, with three pieces of artillery, and 40 men of Eighteenth Illinois Infantry, the latter mounted, whole under command of Colonel Cyrus L. Dunham, Fiftieth Indiana, marched from Trenton to head off the cavalry force under Forrest then moving back from near Columbus, Kentucky, toward the Tennessee River. Moved by way of Huntingdon, Tennessee, and on 30 December a skirmish occurred with the enemy, and on 31 December 1862, at about 11 <b>A.M.,</b> <b>the</b> <b>One</b> Hundred and Twenty-second and Fiftieth Indiana and the 40 men of the Eighteenth Illinois Infantry, {{and a part of}} the Seventh Wisconsin Battery, constituting a force of 1,540 men, engaged in battle with the enemy under Forrest, numbering over 6,000 men with eighteen pieces of artillery. The fight continued till about 2 o’clock P.M., when the enemy fell back leaving the field in possession of the little force that had fought them for nearly three hours, and had during that time captured eight pieces of artillery and 500 prisoners, among them Major Strange, Forrest’s Adjutant General. The loss of the One Hundred and Twenty-second Regiment in killed were 22 enlisted and 1 officer, Lieutenant Bristow, in wounded 56 enlisted men and 2 officers, Colonel Rinaker, who received a severe wound in his right leg, and Captain William B.

500|$|Albert Bouchard {{began writing}} music for Imaginos {{following}} {{the release of}} the band's first album in 1972. There were plans as early as 1975 to release a concept album dedicated to Pearlman's scripts, but the material was not ready. All of the songs had been written by 1977, with the participation of various band members, and at least four of them ("Astronomy", [...] "In the Presence of Another World", [...] "I <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> <b>One</b> You Warned Me Of", [...] "Imaginos") were completed and demoed during the recording sessions for the album Spectres. Demos of the other tracks were recorded by A. Bouchard and remained in various stages of development during the following years, with the band uninterested in pursuing the Imaginos project that Albert Bouchard and Sandy Pearlman had been insistently proposing.|$|E
500|$|Blue Öyster Cult {{interrupted}} their {{schedule of}} US shows only {{just before the}} album release in June 1988, to familiarize the band members with the new material. The 1987 formation with Bloom, Roeser, Lanier, Rogers and Riddle remained the closest available to a full reunion, given J. Bouchard's unwillingness to participate and the opposition to A. Bouchard. The Imaginos Tour began in the East Coast of the US in July, and continued on {{to most of the}} States. The set lists were based mainly on old material and included only two or three songs from Imaginos, usually [...] "I <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> <b>One</b> You Warned Me Of", [...] "In the Presence of Another World" [...] and the new version of [...] "Astronomy". Blue Öyster Cult visited Canada in January 1989, France in February, the United Kingdom in March, and concluded their European tour in Germany in April.|$|E
500|$|Woodford's {{promotion}} {{was announced}} through a press statement without calling a news conference. The press release, which {{was full of}} praise for Woodford, mentioned his success in cutting costs and presented him as the [...] "new global face of Olympus". According to Woodford, Kikukawa had reminded him privately upon appointing him president: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who {{has the authority to}} hire and fire, and to decide remuneration for board members and the next tier down of management," [...] thus signalling Woodford was [...] "little more than his puppet". The New York Times similarly suggested that the promotion may have been intended to instill Woodford with a greater sense of loyalty to the board, and Woodford suggested it was done to reduce his motivation to resign. Nikkei Business noted that the announcement was made only in its English web page, and after talking to Olympus, it commented: [...] "Woodford's title had changed from COO to CEO, but it did not signify any real change in the company's leadership. Woodford himself was soon to realise that his appointment to CEO was in name only." ...|$|E

500|$|Saint-Just {{saved his}} dignity at the lectern {{but not his}} life. Rising in his support, Robespierre {{sputtered}} and lost his voice; his brother Augustin, Philippe Lebas, and other key allies all tried to sway the deputies, but failed. The meeting ended with an order for their arrest. Saint-Just, still on the platform, remained unmoved and [...] "looked on contemptuously" [...] at the scene. His confidence seemed validated when troops from the Paris Commune under Hanriot arrived to liberate them, but within hours the entire group was confined to the Hôtel de Ville. When soldiers finally broke inside, {{a number of the}} defeated Jacobins tried to commit suicide; Saint-Just stood beside Lebas who shot himself in the head. Any contemplation of his own suicide is unclear, but he alone emerged unruffled from the wild, violent final arrest – among the captured, [...] "only St. Just, his hands bound but his head held high, was able to walk." [...] Robespierre, Saint-Just and twenty of their allies were guillotined the next day, and Saint-Just reputedly accepted his death with coolness and pride. At a last formality of identification, he gestured to a copy of the Constitution of 1793 and said, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who made that." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the Palm Beach media {{attention}} and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy's public image suffered. A Gallup Poll gave Kennedy {{a very low}} 22percent national approval rating. A Boston Herald/WCVB-TV poll found that 62 percent of Massachusetts citizens thought Kennedy should not run for re-election, by a 2-to-1 margin thought Kennedy had misled authorities in the Palm Beach investigation, and had Kennedy losing a hypothetical Senate race to Governor William Weld by 25points. Meanwhile, at a June 17, 1991, dinner party, Kennedy saw Victoria Anne Reggie, a Washington lawyer at Keck, Mahin & Cate, a divorced mother of two, and {{the daughter of an}} old Kennedy family ally, Louisiana judge Edmund Reggie. They began dating and by September were in a serious relationship. In a late October speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Kennedy sought to begin a political recovery, saying: [...] "I am painfully aware that the criticism directed at me in recent months involves far more than disagreements with my positions ... involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight the good fight. To them I say, I recognize my own shortcomings– the faults in the conduct of my private life. I realize that I alone am responsible for them, and I <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who must confront them." [...] In December 1991, the William Kennedy Smith rape trial was held; it was nationally televised and the most watched until the O. J. Simpson murder case three years later. Kennedy's testimony at the trial seemed relaxed, confident, and forthcoming, and helped convince the public that his involvement had been peripheral and unintended. Smith was acquitted.|$|E

[...] Of the scandal, Reagan writes, [...] " [...] McFarlane, [...] Poindexter, [...] Casey, and, I presume, [...] North knew how deeply I felt about the need for the contras' survival as a democratic resistance force in Nicaragua. Perhaps that knowledge... led them to support the contras secretly and saw no reason to report this to me."

2500|$|IDF {{chief of}} staff (Ramatkal) Shaul Mofaz urged the {{officers}} to speed things up. They asked for twenty-four more hours. Mofaz told reporters that the fighting would be complete {{by the end of}} the week, April 6. In some of the sectors, the forces were advancing at a rate of fifty meters a day. Israeli intelligence assumed that the vast majority of the camp's residents were still in it. Most commanders argued that this obligated a careful advance for fear of striking civilians, and warned that using excessive force would cost the lives of hundreds of Palestinians. Lieutenant Colonel Ofek Buchris, commander of the 51st Battalion, was left in a minority opinion, saying [...] "We're being humiliated here for four days now". When Mofaz instructed the officers to be more aggressive and fire five antitank missiles at every house before entering, one of them contemplated disobedience. Meanwhile, when asked how long he thought his forces could last given the superiority of the Israeli forces, Abu Jandal said: [...] "No. That's not true. We have the weapon of surprise. We have the weapon of honor. We have the divine weapon, the weapon of Allah who stands at our side. We have weapons that are better than theirs.
