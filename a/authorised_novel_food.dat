40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to develop a}} {{conceptual}} understanding of consumer acceptance of <b>novel</b> <b>foods,</b> grounded in the attitudes, perceptions and behaviours of individuals to foods that were "novel" by virtue of an innovative method of production or newness within the diet. <b>Novel</b> <b>food</b> acceptance is dominated by psycho-sensory research and thus this thesis' behavioural approach provides an alternative perspective that contributes to the food choice and acceptance literature. The grounded theory method (GTM) was selected as the guiding methodology because of its theory building mandate. The GTM procedures were applied to a secondary data set of 45 transcripts drawn from 6 separate research projects. These projects were linked by the common use of the focus group technique to gene rate data together with a complementary subject matter, namely data relating to the attitudes perceptions and experiences of i 11 dividuals to cOnve 11 lional <b>foods,</b> <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> and <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> technologies. The analysis showed <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> acceptance is a cyclical process of acceptance or rejection containing five 'acceptance states', rather than a single decision point. The five acceptance states derived from the analysis 'and related to the consideration, trial and sustained incorporation of a <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> into dietary practices that arc shaped by personal, product and situational factors are: i) conceptual acceptance, or the degree of engagement with and approval of a novel food; ii) connective acceptance,,or the personal connections that an individual makes with a <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> by visualising its potential benefits and its role in satisfying a perceived personal need; iii) evaluative acceptance, or the trade-offs made when evaluating <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> with available alternatives; iv) tri al acceptance, or the practices associated with the preparation of the <b>novel</b> <b>food,</b> the taste: of the <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> and its perceived impact on well-being; and v) dietary acceptance, or the complementarity of a <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> with the structure of existing meal patterns and the substitutability of the <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> with existing foods within the diet. An outcome of this behavioural model of consumer acceptance is the incorporation of the <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> into established dietary practices, which {{is referred to as the}} "acceptability of dietary change".

40|$|Food allergy {{represents}} an increasing concern to society. It {{is defined as}} an inappropriate immunological reaction to normally harmless food components and affects 5 - 8 % of children and 1 - 2 % of adults. Since {{at the time of}} writing no cure for food allergy exists, food allergic consumers need to avoid all problematic foods and ingredients, which may {{have a negative impact on}} the quality of life and economic functioning of food allergic consumers and their families. Food allergies may also result in substantial costs for society overall in terms of health care costs and absenteeism. <b>Novel</b> <b>foods</b> are continuously being developed and introduced onto the European market. The novelty of a food can be the result of: (1) genetic modification (GM) of the food itself, or its production using genetically modified organisms, (2) the application of novel processing techniques, or (3) the food in question having no prior history of consumption in general, or in a specific region or country. One potential benefit of <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> is that of hypoallergenicity, although there is the potential risk that new proteins are introduced into the human food chain together with the <b>novel</b> <b>foods.</b> The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to investigate whether <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> can be used as part of an allergy management strategy. The issues associated with <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> and food allergy are identified and insight is gained in stakeholder and consumer attitudes towards the application of <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> as allergy management strategy. In addition, the existing <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> legislation regarding <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> is reviewed with respect to risks (and benefits) of <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> associated with food allergy. The results show that that although hypoallergenic <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> can have some positive contribution to food allergy management, their influence remains limited because many other factors other than the available foods cause the food allergy problems. Overall, this research contributes to a better understanding of the impact of food allergy on daily lives of food allergic consumers and shows that although hypoallergenic <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> can facilitate allergen avoidance, their influence remains limited because many other factors, such as the recognition of their allergy by their social environment cause the food allergy problems. Nevertheless, considering that the food allergy management options are limited, the contribution that hypoallergenic <b>novel</b> <b>foods,</b> which can be replacement for allergenic foods may be valuable for consumers who are allergic to foods that are easy to recognise and avoid...|$|R

40|$|In the European Union <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> {{are defined}} by the <b>Novel</b> <b>Foods</b> Regulation as food {{products}} and food ingredients {{that have not been}} consumed to a significant degree in the European Union before May 1997. However, there are new foods for some reason not considered as <b>novel</b> <b>foods,</b> although it may not be excluded that they differ from conventional foods {{to such an extent that}} an assessment of their safety prior to their entry to the market would be called for. Previously, we reported that this ‘grey area’ of <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> exists and comprises: (1) food products or ingredients for which the current <b>Novel</b> <b>Foods</b> Regulation leaves too much space for different interpretations and (2) food products or ingredients that are not novel according to the current <b>Novel</b> <b>Foods</b> Regulation, because it contains gaps. This paper focuses on how to handle these interpretation differences and gaps and provides recommendations to improve these pitfalls of the current <b>Novel</b> <b>Foods</b> Regulation. To this end, we propose criteria with clear boundaries as part of an assessment tool to reduce the uncertainties in interpretation with respect to consumption to a significant degree in the European Union, which take into account the commercial availability, length, extent and frequency of use of the particular food/ingredient. In addition, biological relevant boundaries for the criteria regarding changes in the nutritional value, metabolism (better all aspects of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion), and levels of undesirable substances are proposed for significant changes in the composition of foods due to changes in the production process. In addition, criteria are proposed to cover ambiguities and gaps in the <b>Novel</b> <b>Foods</b> Regulation dealing with food products and food ingredients obtained from 1) animals on a new feeding regime, 2) new varieties of organisms, 3) other growth stages of crops. Finally, a criterion that takes into account the total ingredient intake rather than single product intake is added to deal with the risk of overexposure to substances. Taken together, the proposed boundaries and criteria may contribute to diminishing the interpretation issues regarding the <b>Novel</b> <b>Foods</b> Regulation and thus to reducing the extent of the grey area of <b>novel</b> <b>foods.</b> - See more at: [URL]...|$|R
