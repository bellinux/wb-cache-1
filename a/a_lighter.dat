5|$|During {{their early}} years, West Bromwich Albion {{had played in}} {{whatever}} coloured kit was available locally. However, at a committee meeting held in September 1885, the club decreed that blue and white striped jerseys should be adopted on a permanent basis.

5|$|Early Tiger IIs proved unreliable, owing principally to leaking {{seals and}} gaskets, and an {{overburdened}} drive train originally intended for <b>a</b> <b>lighter</b> vehicle.

5|$|In {{cold water}} diving, where a diver wearing a highly buoyant {{thermally}} insulating dive suit {{has a large}} excess of buoyancy, steel cylinders are often used because they are denser than aluminium cylinders. They also often have a lower mass than aluminium cylinders with the same gas capacity, due to considerably higher material strength, so the use of steel cylinders can result in both <b>a</b> <b>lighter</b> cylinder and less ballast required for the same gas capacity, a two way saving on overall dry weight carried by the diver.|$|E
