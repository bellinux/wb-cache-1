5|$|Chamberlain and {{the entire}} {{subsequent}} government carries the blame not to have taken equivalent steps when they discovered Germany's preparations for war. <b>A</b> <b>world</b> <b>power</b> must always be prepared to successfully and energetically repulse any attack. Everyone is certain that England was not sufficiently prepared. Also the fleet did not appear capable of taking decisive action. It's possible that it was merely constraining itself, but that strategy is a mistake. It should have been put into action immediately. Neither in Africa nor in the Mediterranean has the English fleet rigorously counter-attacked.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, the Conservative Party {{returned}} {{to power in}} Britain, {{under the leadership of}} Winston Churchill. Churchill and the Conservatives believed that Britain's position as <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>power</b> relied on the continued existence of the empire, with the base at the Suez Canal allowing Britain to maintain its pre-eminent position in the Middle East in spite of the loss of India. However, Churchill could not ignore Gamal Abdul Nasser's new revolutionary government of Egypt that had taken power in 1952, and the following year it was agreed that British troops would withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and that Sudan would be granted self-determination by 1955, with independence to follow. Sudan was granted independence on 1 January 1956.|$|E

5|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} to the National Socialist leadership that the United Kingdom {{was not interested in}} a military alliance, anti-British policies were adopted to ensure the attainment of Germany’s war aims. Even during the war however, hope remained that Britain would in time yet become a reliable German ally. Hitler preferred to see the British Empire preserved as <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>power,</b> because its break-up would benefit other countries far more than it would Germany, particularly the United States and Japan. In fact, Hitler's strategy during 1935-1937 for winning Britain over was based on a German guarantee of defence of the British Empire. After the war, Ribbentrop testified that in 1935 Hitler had promised to deliver twelve German divisions to the disposal of Britain for maintaining the integrity of her colonial possessions.|$|E
5|$|Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein, Frederick the Great's prime minister, {{believed}} that any Austrian acquisition in Bavaria would shift {{the balance of}} power in the Holy Roman Empire, diminishing Prussia's influence. Prussia's recent gains had been hard-won: thirty years earlier, Frederick had engaged in protracted wars in Silesia and Bohemia, resulting in Prussia's annexation of most of Silesia, and now, with the economy and society modernizing under his direction, Prussia was emerging as <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>power.</b> In the Silesian Wars and the Seven Years' War, Frederick had earned a new, if grudging, respect for his kingdom's military and diplomatic prowess from the European powers of France, Russia, Britain and Austria. To protect Prussia's status and territory, Finck and Frederick constructed an alliance with the Electorate of Saxony, ostensibly to defend the rights of Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{power of the}} Sogdians never recovered. Subsequently, Sogdiana formed part of the Hellenistic Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, a breakaway state from the Seleucid Empire founded in 248 BC by Diodotus I, for roughly a century. Euthydemus I, a former satrap of Sogdiana, seems to have held the Sogdian territory as a rival claimant to the Greco-Bactrian throne; his coins were later copied locally and bore Aramaic inscriptions. The Greco-Bactrian king Eucratides I may have recovered sovereignty of Sogdia temporarily. Finally the area was occupied by nomads when the Scythians and Yuezhis overran it around 145 BC. From then until about 40 BC the Yuezhi tepidly minted coins imitating and still bearing {{the images of the}} Greco-Bactrian kings Eucratides I and Heliocles I, yet soon afterwards they began minting unique coins bearing the faces of their own rulers as a prelude to asserting themselves as <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>power</b> under the Kushan Empire.|$|E

5|$|From {{the end of}} the 13th {{century the}} Ottomans started uniting Anatolia and created an empire that {{encompassed}} much of Southeast Europe, West Asia and North Africa. The Ottoman Empire reached its peak land mass and became <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>power</b> during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent in the early modern period. It remained powerful and influential for two more centuries, until important setbacks in the 17th and 18th century forced it to cede strategic territories in Europe, which signaled the loss of its former military strength and wealth. After the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état, which effectively put the country {{under the control of the}} Three Pashas, the Ottoman Empire decided to join the Central Powers during World War I. The Central Powers were ultimately defeated by the Allied Powers, despite Turkish victories over them during the war. During the war, the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian, Assyrian and Pontic Greek citizens. Following the war, the conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was partitioned into several new states. The Turkish War of Independence, initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his colleagues against occupying Allies, resulted in the abolition of monarchy in 1922 and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, with Atatürk as its first president. Atatürk enacted numerous reforms, many of which incorporated various aspects of western thought, philosophy, and customs into the new form of Turkish government.|$|E

25|$|Tutankhamun {{was nine}} years old when he became Pharaoh and reigned for {{approximately}} ten years.

Secondly, his tomb in the Valley of the Kings was discovered by Carter almost completely intact—the most complete ancient Egyptian royal tomb ever found. As Tutankhamun began his reign at such an early age, his vizier and eventual successor, Ay, was probably making most of the important political decisions during Tutankhamun's reign.|$|E

However, not all events proceeded smoothly for Frederick. The Austrian-Hungarian War (1477–1488) resulted in the Hungarian king, Matthias Corvinus setting himself up in Vienna in 1485 till his death in 1490.

40|$|Is it metaphysically {{possible}} for <b>a</b> <b>world</b> to contain <b>power</b> properties but no nonpower properties? Recently, much {{progress has been}} made by powers theorists to defend the coherence of such a possibility.

The problem is that the most obvious principle of individuation for properties in <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>world</b> is one that is circular. In this paper, it is argued that this circularity is generated by a modal assumption, which is that different families of powers exist in different possible worlds. By rejecting this assumption, a noncircular principle of individuation for power properties can be formulated. Moreover, this solution is not ad hoc because there are independent reasons for rejecting the aforementioned modal assumption...|$|R
