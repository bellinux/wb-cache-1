Knowing the {{absorption spectrum}} allowed us to calculate the quantum efficiencies for PM to K and K to <b>PM</b> <b>conversion</b> at - 196 degrees C. Direct measurements of these quantum yeilds at - 196 degrees C gave 0. 33 +/- 0. 05 and 0. 67 +/- 0. 04, respectively. Determination of relative quantum efficiencies for PM to K and K to <b>PM</b> <b>conversion</b> by analysis of the absorption spectra of several photostationary-state mixtures of PM and K at - 196 degrees C, however, gave wavelength-dependent quantum efficiencies {{that appear to be}} greater than 1.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this program was to develop generic aftertreatment technologies applicable for LDV and LDT engines ranging from 55 kW to 200 kW, to develop an optimized and integrated aftertreatment system for a LDT (Light Duty Truck) type vehicle, and to demonstrate the technology which will enable light duty diesel engines to meet Federal Tier II regulation with minimum impact on fuel economy. Specifically, the development targets for emissions reduction and fuel injection penalty are given below: (1) NOx conversion efficiency > 90 % (hot), > 84 % (combined); (2) <b>PM</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency > 90 % (hot), > 84 % (combined); (3) Fuel penalty over FTP- 75 Less than 5 %; and (4) Fuel penalty at Cruise condition Less than 3 %. Development of cost-effective, highly efficient diesel exhaust aftertreatment systems in combination with very low engine out emission combustion development are essential elements for realization of Federal Tier II emission standards for Light Duty Trucks and Vehicles. Evaluation of several aftertreatment technologies was completed {{as part of this}} program. A combination of Diesel Oxidation Catalyst, NOx Adsorbing Catalyst and Catalyzed Soot Filter was found to provide the levels of conversion efficiency required to achieve the emission targets. While early systems required relatively large catalyst volumes, external dosing, sulfur traps, full bypass configurations and high levels of Platinum metals; the final system is a compact, scalable, flow-through, fully-integrated and engine-managed aftertreatment system capable of commercial application for Light Duty Vehicles and Trucks. NOx adsorber/particulate filter technology is particularly attractive for Light Duty applications due to the lower exhaust flow and temperature requirements as compared to Heavy Duty engines. Despite these strong positive aspects, NOx Adsorbers are challenged by their regeneration requirements and susceptibility to sulfur poisoning and thermal degradation. Capability was developed to regenerate the NOx Adsorber for NOx and SOx as well as the Particulate Filter for soot. This system was fully integrated into a truck and evaluated over the chassis dynamometer for emissions capability and in real-world winter field testing. Durability of the system was evaluated over a variety of accelerated and real-time dynamometer tests. Excellent NOx and <b>PM</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency <b>was</b> demonstrated, even following 3000 hrs of endurance testing. Unregulated emissions emitted by the system were evaluated as was the fuel penalty associated with the DeNOx and DeSOx regeneration processes. In the final evaluation, the system demonstrated 90 % NOx conversion and 99 % <b>PM</b> <b>conversion</b> at a 6 % fuel penalty over the FTP- 75 test cycle. While target fuel penalty levels were demonstrated using full-bypass configuration systems, the cost associated with those systems was prohibitively high and would preclude successful commercialization of the technology. Although the flow-through configuration fell 1 % short of the 5 % fuel penalty target, the cost of this configuration is such that commercial application is feasible. Cost drivers for the final system configuration were identified and demonstrate areas where future development areas could focus...|$|R

The Continuously Regenerating Trap (CRT TM) has been developed to enable diesel engines to meet the proposed future legislation. This passive filter system combines an oxidation catalyst with a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF); the filter traps the PM and the oxidation catalyst generates NO 2 which combusts the trapped PM at substantially lower temperatures than is possible using oxygen. This paper outlines the operating principle of the CRT TM, and describes {{the performance of the}} system. It has been shown that the very high <b>PM</b> <b>conversions</b> obtained with the CRT TM can enable even Euro 1 engines to meet the PM limits proposed for introduction in Europe in 2005.

40|$|Abstract—Phase {{noise in}} {{mutually}} synchronized oscillator sys-tems is analyzed for arbitrary coupling and injection-locking topologies, neglecting amplitude noise, and amplitude modulation (AM) to phase modulation (<b>PM)</b> <b>conversion.</b> When the coupling phase is chosen properly (depending on the oscillator model), the near-carrier phase noise {{is reduced to}} 1 =N that of a single oscilla-tor, provided the coupling network is reciprocal. This is proved in general, and illustrated with specific cases of globally coupled and nearest-neighbor coupled oscillator chains. A slight noise degra-dation is found for unilaterally coupled (nonreciprocal) chains. The 1 =N reduction for reciprocal coupling applies over nearly {{the entire range of}} free-running frequency distributions required for beam-scanning, and is verified experimentally using a linear chain of coupled GaAs MESFET voltage-controlled oscillators (VCO’s) operating atX-band. The effect of a nonoptimum coupling phase on the phase noise of the system is also studied. As the coupling phase deviates from the optimum value, the phase noise increases significantly near the locking range edge for noise offset frequency near the carrier.
