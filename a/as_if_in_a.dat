5|$|The central figure's {{mouth is}} {{positioned}} directly on its neck, {{rather than on}} a distinct face. It bares its teeth <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> snarl, and is blindfolded by a drooping cloth bandage—a device likely drawn from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ. This creature faces the viewer directly and is centralised {{by a series of}} converging lines radiating {{from the base of the}} pedestal.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1967, Peckinpah was {{rewriting}} the screenplay and preparing for the production. The principal photography was shot entirely on location in Mexico, most notably at the Hacienda Ciénaga del Carmen (deep in the desert between Torreón and Saltillo, Coahuila) and on the Rio Nazas. Peckinpah's epic work was inspired by his hunger to return to films, the violence seen in Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967), and America's growing frustration with the Vietnam War and what he {{perceived to be the}} utter lack of reality seen in Westerns up to that time. He set out to make a film which portrayed not only the vicious violence of the period, but as well the crude men attempting to survive the era. Multiple scenes attempted in Major Dundee, including slow motion action sequences (inspired by Akira Kurosawa's work in Seven Samurai (1954)), characters leaving a village <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> funeral procession and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, would become fully realized in The Wild Bunch.|$|E
5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us {{it was out of}} his hands, and go back on his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E

5|$|It was {{conceived}} and produced by Coldplay. Originally, {{it had been}} intended for the whole band {{to appear in the}} video, in a sunny setting. Champion's mother's funeral was held {{on the day of the}} shooting, so it was decided that only Martin would appear in the video, which was also the immediate explanation of his mood during this part. The weather also opposed the original plan, with harsh winds and rain instead of the sunny day that had been envisioned. It had also been originally intended for there to be moving stars in the sky, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> time-lapse. The directors agreed that the moving stars would distract the focus of the video from Martin. The plan of time advancing was kept. The video begins with the beach being somewhat dark until sunlight arrives nearly at the video's midway point.|$|E
5|$|The 49ers' Million Dollar Backfield is {{regarded}} as one of the best backfields in NFL history, and is the only full-house backfield to have all four of its members enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. By virtue of their memberships in the pro hall of fame, all four were automatically inducted as charter members of the San Francisco 49ers Hall of Fame in 2009. Longtime 49ers coach Bill Walsh co-authored a book about the backfield in 2000 entitled The Million Dollar Backfield: The San Francisco 49ers in the 1950s. In 2014, a sculpture comprising the four players, crouched over <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> huddle, was erected in Levi's Stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} shows a {{large room}} in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid {{during the reign of}} King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> snapshot. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position {{similar to that of the}} viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velázquez is shown working on.|$|E

25|$|After Yeltsin's death, a Dutch neurosurgeon, Michiel Staal, {{said that}} his team had been {{secretly}} flown to Moscow to operate on Yeltsin in 1999. Yeltsin suffered from an unspecified neurological disorder that affected his sense of balance, causing him to wobble <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> drunken state; {{the goal of the}} operation was to reduce the pain.|$|E

Each of the four houses is decorated and furnished <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different era; 1840s, 1870s, 1930s and 1970s. Visits are by pre-booked, timed guided tours only.|$|E
25|$|The casket was opened, {{and after}} viewing the body Jacqueline Kennedy {{asked for a}} closed casket funeral. But she left the final {{decision}} to her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy. Robert Kennedy, Walton, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, and four others viewed the body shortly before 5:00 A.M. McNamara said the casket should be kept closed. Walton agreed, which convinced Robert Kennedy that a closed-casket funeral would be held. Walton remembered sleeping <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> daze {{for the next few}} hours.|$|E
25|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{condition}} of the concrete roof structure on the main building brought forward major changes to the museum in 1990. To maintain a presence at York, the former York goods depot across Leeman Road, already in use as a museum store (the Peter Allen Building), was configured to display trains <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> passenger station, and this together with the adjacent South Yard was marketed as The Great Railway Show. A further selection of exhibits formed the National Railway Museum on Tour on display for a season in the former Swindon Works.|$|E

25|$|Probably Delacroix's best-known painting, Liberty Leading the People is {{an unforgettable}} image of Parisians, having taken up arms, marching forward {{under the banner}} of the tricolour {{representing}} liberty, equality, and fraternity. Although Delacroix was inspired by contemporary events to invoke this romantic image of the spirit of liberty, he seems to be trying to convey the will and character of the people, rather than glorifying the actual event, the 1830 revolution against Charles X, which did little other than bring a different king, Louis-Philippe, to power. The warriors lying dead in the foreground offer poignant counterpoint to the symbolic female figure, who is illuminated triumphantly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> spotlight.|$|E
25|$|Although {{spanning}} fifty years, {{the novel}} is not epic in scope, focusing instead on the small private details of the characters' lives. Except for the first, each section takes place on a single day of its titular year, and each year is defined by a particular moment in the cycle of seasons. At {{the beginning of each}} section, and sometimes as a transition within sections, Woolf describes the changing weather all over Britain, taking in both London and countryside <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bird's-eye view before focusing in on her characters. Although these descriptions move across the whole of England in single paragraphs, Woolf only rarely and briefly broadens her view to the world outside Britain.|$|E
25|$|Mary is {{described}} by scholars as an Eleusa icon because of the tender {{manner in which the}} child is nestled against her cheek, setting the image as an intimate portrayal of the bond between mother and child. Her head is tilted towards her son and embraces his forehead and cheek almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> kiss, while her arms warmly cradle him. He has one leg bent and another extended towards her, while his right arm is held upright and intimately holds her chin from below. This closeness and engagement of mother and child is a departure from Byzantine tradition, where they were often shown almost at arms length, and was in tune with the ideals of the Italian Quattrocento.|$|E

25|$|In 1900, on the {{occasion}} of the festival of Eid ul-Adha, he is said to have delivered an hour-long sermon extempore in Arabic expounding the meaning and philosophy of sacrifice. This episode is celebrated as one of the important events of the history of Ahmadiyya. The sermon was simultaneously written down by two of his companions and came to be known as the Khutba Ilhamiyya, the revealed or inspired sermon. Ahmadiyya literature states that during this sermon, there was a change in his voice, he appeared <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> trance, in the grip of an unseen hand, and as if a voice from the unknown had made him its mouthpiece. After the sermon ended, Ahmad fell into prostration, followed by the rest of the congregation, as a sign of gratitude towards God.|$|E
25|$|In early 2005, {{the band}} started {{recording}} Howling Bells at Parr Street Studios in Liverpool. Some of Coldplay's equipment from the X sessions {{was still in}} the facility when Howling Bells arrived. They recorded Howling Bells in two to three months, with all the main vocal and instrument tracking done in real time, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> live setting. This was a staple of Nelson's recording approach. Due to the personal significance of her songs, Juanita had the studio lights turned off {{in order to make the}} recording experience feel more private. The band appreciated Nelson's techniques and studio abilities. They stated that he was great sonically and very adept at de-emphasising some songs that they had initially approached overzealously. They also expressed that they felt fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with the award-winning producer.|$|E
25|$|Verus {{continued}} eastward via Corinth and Athens, {{accompanied by}} musicians and singers <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> royal progress. At Athens he stayed with Herodes Atticus, {{and joined the}} Eleusinian Mysteries. 1.869, 872; HA Hadrian 13.1. During sacrifice, a falling star was observed in the sky, shooting west to east. He stopped in Ephesus, where he is attested at the estate of the local aristocrat Vedius Antoninus, and made an unexpected stopover at Erythrae, where an elegiac poem {{in the voice of}} the local sibyl alludes to his visit. The journey continued by ship through the Aegean and the southern coasts of Asia Minor, lingering in the famed pleasure resorts of Pamphylia and Cilicia, before arriving in Antioch. It is not known how long Verus' journey east took; he might not have arrived in Antioch until after 162. Statius Priscus, meanwhile, must have already arrived in Cappadocia; he would earn fame in 163 for successful generalship.|$|E
