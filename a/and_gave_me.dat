At the time, he did not reveal that this was for research, and instead pretended to have a dying relative. According to Maxtone-Graham, the tour helped him find out [...] "all about urns versus coffins, and cremation. I asked sort of questions about, 'Well, do the bodies smell?' They were very nice <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> all the answers. It was quite fascinating." ...|$|E

John Chiorini, a 17-year-old Eagle Scout, {{was working on the}} waterfront. [...] "Béla came through camp with a patrol of six or seven boys and commandeered me to teach a class on camp craft.

[...] The new play is assumed to have been The Relapse, and it turned out the success Rich needed. [...] "This play", notes Colley Cibber in his autobiography, [...] "from its new and easy turn of wit, had great success, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me,</b> as a comedian, a second flight of reputation along with it."

Vandernoot likes the Tessa character quite a bit <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> the impression she was sad to see her go," [...] and that she [...] "...looks like she enjoys playing the good/bad Lisa. Her triple performance as Tessa shows Vandernoot's range." [...] Kathie Huddleston of Scifi.com felt that [...] "...a visit from Tessa in [...] "Counterfeit", even an evil Tessa look-alike, is a welcome nod to a significant character from the first season, and it gave our boy Duncan a moment or two to reflect on his recent lost love." ...|$|E

500|$|After Bennett's {{first visit}} to Germany there {{followed}} three extended visits to work in Leipzig. He was there from October 1836 to June 1837, during which time he made his debut at the Gewandhaus as the soloist in his Third Piano Concerto with Mendelssohn conducting. He later conducted his Naiads overture. During this visit he also arranged the first cricket match ever played in Germany, ("as fitting a Yorkshireman" [...] as the musicologist Percy M. Young comments). At this time Bennett wrote to Davison: took me to his house <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> the printed score of [...] 'Melusina', and afterwards we supped at the 'Hôtel de Bavière', where all the musical clique feed... The party consist of Mendelssohn, [...] David, Stamity ... and a Mr. Schumann, a musical editor, who expected to see me a fat man with large black whiskers.|$|E
500|$|Former KMFDM member Raymond Watts, {{last seen}} {{contributing}} vocals, programming, and production to 1988's Don't Blow Your Top before starting his own band, Pig, called Konietzko {{and asked if}} he would be interested in working on a small musical collaboration. [...] Konietzko agreed, and Watts flew to Seattle, where the pair, along with Schulz, worked on an EP entitled Sin Sex & Salvation. [...] Konietzko said of the trio's working together, [...] "It was the breath of fresh air I had been hoping and waiting for. [...] This short project took my mind off the problems with the KMFDM album <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> a welcome change of perspective." [...] Watts then stayed on with the group to begin work on Nihil, which featured a core group of Konietzko, Schulz, Watts, and Esch, along with some input from steel guitar specialist Durante and drummer Bill Rieflin.|$|E

Gomez saw the fight {{as an opportunity to}} reignite his career; in an interview shortly before the fight he spoke of how [...] "his fight really is my last chance to set myself up for life and become known in every household in Britain". At the same time, he reflected on the positive effects of his career in the ring, saying [...] "Boxing kept my feet on the ground <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> a focus.

500|$|Tom Chambers was {{approached}} about assuming {{the role of}} Sam by BBC casting director Julie Harkin, who was also responsible for casting fellow Holby City newcomers Rakie Ayola as Kyla Tyson and Luke Roberts as Joseph Byrne. Chambers has revealed that he sent a video of himself performing a Fred Astaire tap dance routine to over 800 stage and television directors and producers in the [...] UK, explaining: [...] "Julie Harkin in casting at Holby saw it <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> a call because {{they thought it was}} unusual. Originally I went up for a small role as an American doctor, but after the audition they said come back next week to audition for a bigger part and that was it!" [...] Upon assuming the role of Sam, Chambers revealed that he had once been an avid viewer of Holby City's sister show, Casualty, recalling watching it as far back as 1991.|$|E
500|$|Sutton was {{diagnosed}} with stage 3B colorectal cancer {{at the age of}} 15, and subsequently went through aggressive radiation and chemotherapy treatments. He was declared cancer-free, but a tumour returned behind his knee, which was treated by further chemotherapy. Doctors considered an amputation of Sutton's left leg, but the tumour had already spread to other parts of his lower body. In December 2012, two years after the initial diagnosis, the cancer was deemed incurable after spreading to the lungs and liver. Sutton did not ask how long he was expected to survive, choosing to measure his life in the difference he could make, rather than in time. On 24 January 2014, in a speech at London's O2 Arena, he called his first diagnosis [...] "a good thing. It was a huge kick up the backside, it taught me to take nothing for granted, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> a lot of motivation for life".|$|E
500|$|Fellini's {{creative}} process for La Strada started with vague feelings, [...] "a kind of tone", he said, [...] "that lurked, {{which made me}} melancholy <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> a diffused sense of guilt, like a shadow hanging over me. This feeling suggested two people who stay together, although it will be fatal, and they don't know why". These feelings evolved into certain images: snow silently falling on the ocean, various compositions of clouds, and a singing nightingale. At that point, Fellini started to draw and sketch these images, a habitual tendency that he claimed he had learned {{early in his career}} when he had worked in various provincial music halls and had to sketch out the various characters and sets. Finally, he reported that the idea first [...] "became real" [...] to him when he drew a circle {{on a piece of paper}} to depict Gelsomina's head, and he decided to base the character on the actual character of Giulietta Masina, his wife of five years at the time: [...] "I utilized the real Giulietta, but as I saw her. I was influenced by her childhood photographs, so elements of Gelsomina reflect a ten-year-old Giulietta." ...|$|E

500|$|One of {{the songs}} Carey {{recorded}} specifically for #1's was a cover of Brenda K. Starr's [...] "I Still Believe" [...] (1988) co-produced by Stevie J and Mike Mason. During the late 1980s Starr helped Carey secure a record contract while she worked as Starr's backup singer. In the album's liner notes, Carey wrote {{that the purpose of}} the song was solely paying tribute to her. According to Carey, the song [...] "reminds me of the fact that not long ago I was a teenage girl with nothing to my name but a demo tape, my voice, and my ability to write songs. Brenda K. Starr treated me like a 'star' <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> a shot." [...] Another song Carey and Stevie J co-produced was a cover of, [...] "Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)" [...] (1975) by Diana Ross. The latter song was the third non-original song on the album, and experienced a limited release throughout few countries in Europe. During a press release for the album, it was reported that an exclusive live version of [...] "Hero" [...] would be included. However, the idea fell through and was never released.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Dev {{recorded}} {{two songs}} using the software GarageBand on her MacBook {{that a friend}} posted onto her Myspace page. Production duo The Cataracs, consisting of Niles Hollowell-Dhar and David Singer-Vine, came across the songs and asked Dev to come to Berkeley, California to produce music with them. Six months later, the first song they made together, [...] "2night", gained exposure on the television channel MTVU and local radio channels, {{which resulted in a}} debut on the Billboard Hot Dance Airplay chart. In 2009, Dev signed with Indie-Pop Records and moved to a loft in Los Angeles, California to begin working on her debut album. The Cataracs eventually made the beat for a song called [...] "Booty Bounce". Afterwards, a hook was written for the song and The Cataracs suggested to interpolate it into a track they were making for Far East Movement. Dev agreed to what would become [...] "Like a G6", and later said, [...] "It ended up being a massive song <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> so much experience and opportunity and it was absolutely beautiful. Thank god I agreed to that!" [...] The song was released in April 2010 and reached the top ten on several charts worldwide, including the United States, where it reached the top position and sold over three million copies. In August 2010, Dev issued a viral music video for [...] "Booty Bounce" [...] and subsequently signed a record deal with Universal Republic two months later.|$|E
