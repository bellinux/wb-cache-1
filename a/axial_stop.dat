The stop face and the backup face are those surfaces which engage when the axial load on the impeller exceeds the load balancing capability. The plugs have a truncated conical configuration so as to be trapped in the backup face, and are placed at varying radii on the face to provide complete surface lubrication. The plugs may be formed from Teflon, Kel-F or bronze filled Teflon...|$|E

The ball screw extends through the actuator housing {{and has a}} first end and a second end. The ball screw is coupled to receive a drive force and is configured, upon receipt of the drive force, to selectively move in a retract direction and an extend direction. The <b>axial</b> soft <b>stop</b> assembly is disposed within the actuator housing. The <b>axial</b> soft <b>stop</b> assembly is configured to be selectively engaged by the ball screw and, upon being engaged thereby, to translate, with compliance, a predetermined distance in the extend direction, and to prevent further movement of the ball screw upon translating the predetermined distance...|$|R
40|$|The slide wedge device has {{at least}} one pair if opposingly movable slide wedge {{components}} (14), which by means of tension devices (16) are tensioned radially inwards, locating on the base plate (20) and the wedge pressure plate (12). The tension on the slide wedge components can be invalidated with little delay, and is adjustable. The wedge pressure plate may have one or more wedge surfaces with a wedge angle corresponding to that of the slide wedge components. The wedge pressure plate can be axially slidably movably accommodated in a housing (18) with an <b>axial</b> end <b>stop</b> for it. ADVANTAGE - With technically simple means, a secure press power transmission is made possible and the arrangement also offers a rapidly and easily releasable overload protection...|$|R
2500|$|Orthalicus reses is a snail with a large, {{conical shell}} that is {{approximately}} 45 to 55mm in length. The {{thickness of the}} shell varies, but is usually more lightweight and translucent than other species of Orthalicus. [...] The external ground color of the shell is white to buff, with three poorly developed spiral bands and several flame-like purple-brown <b>axial</b> stripes that <b>stop</b> at the lower of the spiral bands. The axial stripes are typically narrower than their whitish interspaces and do not fork near the upper suture. There are two to three white apical whorls. The last whorl contains two to four darker brown growth-rest varices. The columella and parietal callus are white or faint chestnut brown.|$|R
40|$|The {{adenosine}} antagonist 7 -methylxanthine (7 -mx) {{works against}} myopia in animal models. In a clinical trial, 68 myopic children (mean age 11. 3  years) received either placebo or 7 -mx tablets for 12  months. All participants subsequently received 7 -mx for another 12  months, after which treatment was <b>stopped.</b> <b>Axial</b> length {{was measured with}} Zeiss IOL-Master and cycloplegic refraction with Nikon Retinomax at − 6, 0, 12, 24, and 36  months. Axial growth was reduced among children treated with 7 -mx for 24  months compared with those only treated for the last 12  months. Myopia progression and axial eye growth slowed down in periods with 7 -mx treatment, but when the treatment was stopped, both myopia progression and axial eye growth continued with invariable speed. The results indicate that 7 -mx reduces eye elongation and myopia progression in childhood myopia. The treatment is safe and without side effects and may be continued until 18 – 20  years of age when myopia progression normally stops...|$|R
40|$|Myopia is {{emerging}} as a major public health issue due to its increasing prevalence and long-term pathological outcomes. Prevention must focus on limiting excessive axial elongation which {{is the cause of}} both myopic refractive error and its pathological outcomes. The increasing prevalence appears to be due to environmental changes involving near work, rather than to a genetic failure of emmetropisation. Attempts to control the progression of myopia optically have been unsuccessful; the only available preventive regime involves the use of atropine eye drops. This regime has short-term side effects, and since the site and mechanism of action of muscarinic antagonists are unclear, there are concerns about its long-term safety. Recent studies on natural STOP growth signals suggest that they are evoked by relatively brief periods of imposed myopic defocus, and can overcome strong pressures towards increased <b>axial</b> elongation. While <b>STOP</b> signals have only been successfully used in chickens to prevent excessive axial elongation, similar signals are generated in mammals and non-human primates. Further studies may define the conditions under which this approach could be used to prevent the development of myopia in humans. ...|$|R
30|$|These NWs grow {{rapidly in}} the axial {{direction}} {{with the help of}} the Sn catalyst. In the meantime, SiHx radicals also reach the NW sidewalls. These radicals deliver a few nanometers to a few tens of nanometers of radial epitaxial growth before breakdown and the development of an amorphous Si coating on the sidewalls. The radial sidewall growth rate is around 30 – 40 times smaller than the axial growth rate. The diameter of the NWs at their tip remains almost constant during the growth. Since the base part of the NWs experiences a longer deposition duration, its diameter is larger. This results in a slightly conical geometry for the NWs. During the growth process, there are always NWs that stop growing due to kinking, as shown in Fig.  8 d. After a certain growth duration, all the NWs <b>stop</b> <b>axial</b> growth because of the exhaustion of the Sn catalyst. Then the top diameters of these NWs start to increase due to the deposition of a-Si:H on the top part. Since the mean free path of SiHx radicals in the plasma is much bigger than the NW length and the distance between the NWs, it is difficult for the SiHx radicals to arrive at the bottom part of the crowded NW forest. Therefore, the increase of NW diameter at the top part is bigger than that at the bottom part.|$|R
40|$|Conference theme: New Horizons in Rock Mechanics - Developments and Applications"Multiple-step Loading Triaxial Compression Test (ML-TCT), allows {{evaluating}} {{shear strength}} parameters, i. e. cohesion and friction angle {{from a single}} specimen. The test consists {{of a series of}} consolidation and shearing steps, and in each step the <b>axial</b> loading is <b>stopped</b> or reversed before a complete failure. The ISRM suggested method have suggested to increase axial load until the axial stress-strain curve show a horizontal tangent (Etan = 0). However, due to large plastic deformations in the specimen immediately before arriving to this critical point, the shear strengths obtained by this method are prone to be underestimated comparing with those for intact specimens. In this study, a new multiple-step loading method is proposed for the determination of the triaxial compression strength envelope. Series of Single-step Loading Triaxial Compression Tests (SL-TCTs), and ML-TCTs in increasing and decreasing confining pressure steps were carried out using a sedimentary soft rock, mudstone. Careful examination of the axial stress-strain relationship lead to the conclusion that, {{the point at which the}} secant Young’s modulus became the maximum value (Esec = max) appeared to be a suitable criterion for estimating the imminent failure of the rock specimen. The failure envelopes derived using this method closely approximated that derived from SL-TCTs on intact specimens. Whereas, the shear strengths determined based on the ISRM suggested method were not in good agreement with those for intact specimens. A. Taheri, K. Tan...|$|R
40|$|Deformation of the Eastern Cordillera, as a double-verging thrust {{belt that}} {{separates}} the Magdalena Valley from the Llanos Basin, is a defining {{moment in the history}} of the northern Andes in South America. Here we examine the age and depositional setting of the youngest stratigraphic unit in three sectors of the Eastern Cordillera: (i) the Santa Teresa Formation (western flank), (ii) the Usme Formation (southern central axis), and (iii) the Concentración Formation (northeastern central axis). These units were deposited prior to the main Neogene deformation events. They represent the last preserved record of lowland conditions in the Eastern Cordillera, and they are coeval with a thick syn-orogenic deposition reported in the Llanos Basin and Magdalena Valley. Based on palynological data, we conclude that the upper Usme Formation was deposited during the Bartonian-earliest Rupelian? (Late Eocene-earliest Oligocene?); the Concentración Formation was deposited during the Late Lutetian-Early Rupelian (Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene), and the upper Santa Teresa Formation was accumulated during the Burdigalian (Early Miocene). These ages, together with considerations on maximum post-depositional burial, provide important time differences for the age of initial uplift and exhumation along the axial zone and western foothills of the Eastern Cordillera. The switch from sediment accumulation to erosion in the southern axial zone of the Eastern Cordillera occurred during the Rupelian-Early Chattian (Oligocene, ca 30 to ca 26 Ma), and in the northeastern axial zone occurred prior to the latest Chattian-Aquitanian (latest Oligocene-Early Miocene ca 23 Ma). In contrast, in the western flank, the switch occurred during the Tortonian (Late Miocene, ca 10 Ma). In addition, we detected a marine transgression affecting the Usme and Concentración formations during the Late Eocene; coeval marine transgression has been also documented in the Central Llanos Foothills and Llanos Basin, as evidenced by the similarity in floras, but not in the western foothills. Our dataset supports previous sedimentological, geochemical and thermochronological works, which indicated that (i) deformation in the Eastern Cordillera was a diachronous process, (ii) the sedimentation along the <b>axial</b> zone <b>stopped</b> first in the south and then in the north during the Oligocene, (iii) depositional systems of the axial zone and central Llanos Foothills kept partly connected at least until the Late Eocene, and (iv) Miocene strata were only recorded in adjacent foothills as well as the Magdalena and Llanos basins...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{mechanical properties}} of rocks by triaxial compression (TC) testing, several identical samples are required. Multiple-step loading (ML) TC testing permits determination of a failure envelope for different confinement stress levels using a single sample. The test {{consists of a}} series of consolidation and shearing steps, and in each step the <b>axial</b> loading is <b>stopped</b> or reversed before a complete failure. In the method suggested by the International Society of Rock Mechanics (ISRM), axial load should be increased until the axial stress-strain curve shows a horizontal tangent. However, in most brittle rocks, at peak stress failure occurs almost instantaneously and without any precursory signs. In this situation, attempting the ML test is very difficult. A new ML loading test method is proposed for the determination of the triaxial compression strength envelope in brittle rocks. A series of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), single-step loading (SL) and ML TC tests were conducted on pyritic schist rock samples. It was observed that, during axial loading, {{the point at which the}} value of secant Young's modulus is maximum (E sec =max), is the most suitable criterion for estimating the imminent rock failure. Using the proposed method, the peak and residual strengths at different confining pressures, asobtained by a set of SL TC tests, can be determined rather accurately from the results of a ML test using a single specimen. Finally, it was concluded that, in brittle rocks, ML test increasing σ 3 produces more reliable results as compare to ML test decreasing σ 3. A Taheri, E Chand...|$|R
