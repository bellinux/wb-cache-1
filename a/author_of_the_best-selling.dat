500|$|Wollstonecraft's {{work has}} also {{had an effect on}} {{feminism}} outside the academy in recent years. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a political writer and former Muslim who is critical of Islam in general and its dictates regarding women in particular, cited the Rights of Woman in her autobiography Infidel and wrote that she was [...] "inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft, the pioneering feminist thinker who told women they had the same ability to reason as men did and deserved the same rights". British writer Caitlin Moran, <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best-selling</b> How to Be a Woman, described herself as [...] "half Wollstonecraft" [...] to the New Yorker. She has also inspired more widely. Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, the Indian economist and philosopher who first identified the missing women of Asia, draws repeatedly on Wollstonecraft as a political philosopher in The Idea of Justice.|$|E

2500|$|In 1973, Diamond {{switched}} labels again, {{returning to}} Columbia Records for a million-dollar-advance-per-album contract (US$ in [...] dollars). His first project, released {{as a solo}} album, was the soundtrack to Hall Bartlett's film version of Jonathan Livingston Seagull. The film received hostile reviews and did poorly at the box office, and the album grossed more than the film did. Richard D. Bach, <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best-selling</b> source story, disowned the film, and both he and Diamond sued director Bartlett, though for differing reasons; in Bach's case, {{it was because he}} felt the film omitted too much from the original novella, whereas in Diamond's case, it was because he felt the film had butchered his score. [...] "After 'Jonathan,'" [...] Diamond declared, [...] "I vowed never to get involved in a movie again unless I had complete control." [...] Bartlett angrily responded to Diamond's lawsuit by criticizing his music as having become [...] "too slick...and it's not as much from his heart as it used to be." [...] However, Bartlett also added, [...] "Neil is extraordinarily talented. Often his arrogance is just a cover for the lonely and insecure person underneath." ...|$|E
