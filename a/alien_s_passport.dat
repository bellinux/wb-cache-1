In March 2009, GAO reported on weaknesses in State's passport issuance process that could allow a terrorist or criminal to fraudulently acquire a genuine U. <b>S.</b> <b>passport.</b> Specifically, GAO easily obtained four genuine passports from State using counterfeit documents. In April 2009, GAO suggested that State take 5 corrective actions based on these undercover tests and State acknowledged those corrective actions. GAO was asked to perform additional proactive testing of State's passport issuance process to determine if it continues to be vulnerable to fraud. To do this work, GAO applied for seven U. <b>S.</b> <b>passports</b> using counterfeit or fraudulently obtained documents, such as driver's licenses and birth certificates, to simulate scenarios based on identity theft. GAO created documents for seven fictitious or deceased individuals using off-the-shelf, commercially available hardware, software, and materials.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony highlights {{the results of our}} March 2009 report on undercover investigative tests, which confirmed the continued existence of significant fraud vulnerabilities in this process. We also provided a letter to you in April 2009, describing our recent work on passport fraud and summarizing actions the Department of State (State) has taken to address the prior weaknesses related to fraud vulnerabilities we identified. We have found that these vulnerabilities stem from people, process, and technology. For example, the lack of training and resources provided to people contributes to vulnerabilities in the detection of fraudulent applications and counterfeit documents. The limitations in the access to inter-agency information contribute to vulnerabilities related to processes. Finally, the lack of databases and information-sharing technologies contribute to vulnerabilities in the verification of passport applicants' records. A U. <b>S.</b> <b>passport</b> not only allows an individual to travel freely {{in and out of the}} United States, but also can be used to obtain further identification documents, prove U.

Because passports issued under a false identity help enable individuals to conceal their movements and activities, there is great concern that passport fraud could facilitate acts of terrorism. Further, passport fraud facilitates other crimes such as illegal immigration, money laundering, drug trafficking, tax evasion, and alien smuggling. Malicious individuals may seek to exploit vulnerabilities in State's current passport issuance process, such as a lack of due diligence on the part of examiners who screen applications, by using counterfeit or fraudulently obtained documents as proof of identity and U.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of a universal digitalized biometric ID system risks normalizing and integrating mass cybersurveillance into {{the daily lives of}} ordinary citizens. ID documents such as driver’s licenses in some states and all U. <b>S.</b> <b>passports</b> are now implanted with radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. In recent proposals, Congress has considered implementing a digitalized biometric identification card—such as a biometric-based, “high-tech” Social Security Card—which may eventually lead {{to the development of a}} universal multimodal biometric database (e. g., the collection of the digital photos, fingerprints, iris scans, and/or DNA of all citizens and noncitizens). Such “hightech” IDs, once merged with GPS-RFID tracking technology, would facilitate exponentially a convergence of cybersurveillance-body tracking and data surveillance, or dataveillance-biographical tracking. Yet, the existing Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is tethered to a “reasonable expectation of privacy” test that does not appear to restrain the comprehensive, suspicionless amassing of databases that concern the biometric data, movements, activities, and other personally identifiable information of individuals. In this Article, I initiate a project to explore the constitutional and other legal consequences of big data cybersurveillance generally and mass biometric dataveillance in particular.

40|$|Abstract — New {{applications}} for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology include embedding transponders in everyday things used by individuals, such as books, payment cards, and personal identification. While RFID technology {{has existed for}} decades, these new applications carry with them substantial new privacy and security risks for individuals. These risks arise due {{to a combination of}} aspects involved in these applications: 1) The transponders are permanently embedded in objects individuals commonly carry with them 2) Static data linkable to an individual is stored on these transponders 3) The objects these transponders are embedded in are used in public places where individuals have limited control over who can access data on the transponder. In 2002, the U. S. Department of State proposed the adoption of an “electronic passport,” which embedded RFID transponders into U. <b>S.</b> <b>passports</b> for identification and document security purposes. In this paper, we use the U. S. Government’s adoption process for the electronic passport as a case study for identifying the privacy and security risks that arise by embedding RFID technology in “everyday things. ” We discuss the reasons why the Department of State did not adequately identify and address these privacy and security risks, even after the government’s process mandated a privacy impact assessment. We conclude with recommendations to assist government as well as industry in early identification and resolution of relevant risks posed by RFID technology embedded in everyday things. I...|$|R

The research question revolved around the identity and access management framework used by 13 community colleges in Texas to track guest users and the college 2 ̆ 7 s ability to protect the college from illegal acts.

Summary Chapter II reports that Part IIIAAA of the Defence Act 1903 (Cth) is with one exception appropriate (in the sense discussed in Chapter II of the INSLM’s First Annual Report). The call out powers are also, {{based on the same}} considerations, necessary (again, in the sense discussed in Chapter II of the INSLM’s First Annual Report). Mercifully, there are no empirical data to enable the INSLM to report whether, in practice, these provisions for the call out powers are effective (again, in the sense discussed in Chapter II of the INSLM’s First Annual Report). However, the INSLM has not found any reason to doubt the suitability of these laws to achieve their intended purpose, in practical terms. That does not mean that continuing consultation should not be had, in particular with ADF officers experienced in the area, to detect in advance any curable defects in the efficient deployment of lawful military force against terrorism in Australia. The one exception noted above consists of non-compliance of Division 3 B of Part IIIAAA of the Defence Act with ICCPR. The ADF should not be authorized to kill innocent passengers and crew in airliners. Chapter III seeks to reconcile with the CT Laws the related legislation comprising the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 (Cth). There are defects in Commonwealth statutory powers and authorities desirable to counter terrorism, in relation to that overlap. The matters concerning which the INSLM makes recommendations in this area are relatively urgent, given the currency and gravity of the involvement of Australians in Syria. Chapter IV confronts what may be an intractable difficulty in the proper administration of criminal justice in countering terrorism: the typical need to investigate and prove events and circumstances that took place in foreign countries. Some of the most significant examples of these countries suffer from extraordinary breakdowns of law and order. Chapter V is also actuated by some urgency pointed up by current experiences in Syria. We need more rapid control of the way passports are used to facilitate travel for the purposes of terrorist activity. The topic engenders a broader and deeper concern with dual citizenship. Chapter VI is the INSLM’s response to matters raised by agencies, themselves in response to the INSLM’s request for suggestions as to practical improvements to the laws governing their counter-terrorist activities. It is intended to advance effectiveness while observing appropriateness...|$|R

Accordingly, the ATS was originally understood to give federal courts jurisdiction only over claims by <b>aliens</b> against U. <b>S.</b> citizens for intentional torts to person or personal property. In Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, the Supreme Court sought to interpret the ATS in accordance with the expectations of the First Congress. If the Court adheres to this goal in Kiobel, then it should conclude that it lacks statutory subject matter jurisdiction over the case. If the Court decides that the ATS does not apply to suits between aliens, then the Court likely will never have occasion to decide the thorny question of corporate liability under the ATS. Under the express terms of 28 U. S. C. § 1332, federal courts already have jurisdiction over suits by <b>aliens</b> against U. <b>S.</b> corporations provided that the amount in controversy is greater than $ 75, 000. 00 — a condition easily met in cases against large corporations...|$|R
