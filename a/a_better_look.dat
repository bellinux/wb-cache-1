As a child, Gleeson would sneak as close as he could to the Melbourne Tigers bench to get <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> at legendary coach Lindsay Gaze and his players during Warrnambool's annual Seaside Basketball tournament every Australia Day weekend. Gleeson was keen on basketball in his youth and w{{as a member of}} Warrnambool's under 14 team which finished third at the Australian championships.

25|$|In 1968, R. G. Harrison, a {{professor}} of anatomy, used a portable x-ray machine to get <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> at the internal structures of the mummy to better determine age and cause of death of Tutankhamun. One of the most abnormal findings was the sternum (breastbone) and {{most parts of the}} frontal ribs were missing. Removing these bones {{was not part of the}} normal mummification process, which led Harrison to believe they might have been removed because they were badly damaged before his death. Harrison quickly discovered that Carter was not as careful as many of his personal notes had claimed. The mummy was not re-wrapped after 1926, which led to more deterioration due to the extremely hot external elements over the forty-two years. Also many of the limbs had been amputated in the body in order to remove some of the jewellery. Both hands were cut off, both legs were removed from the pelvis, and the head was severed from the body in order to get the mask off. Even more remarkable is the king's right ear and penis were missing, but photographs from Carter show they were both present during his examination. Harrison believed the slight curve in the spine and small bone fragments might have been the result of the embalming process. The lesion on the left jaw showed signs of healing occurred before his death and one of his legs had been broken, but it could not be determined if it happened naturally or as a result of the embalming or Carter's examination. The fact that skull fragments were discovered led many to assume the king was murdered by a blow to the head, but the x-ray could not support or discredit this theory.|$|E
500|$|The {{site was}} first rediscovered by {{accident}} in 1898 when Archibald Hamilton was riding across Withypool Heath. His horse stumbled {{against one of}} the stones, and on further investigation he located other stones within the bracken. After the bracken on the heath was burned away, something that took place periodically to encourage new growth, Hamilton returned to get <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> at the circle. He contacted Colonel Bramble, the Vice President of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society, who put him in touch with the archaeologist Harold St George Gray. Gray then accompanied Hamilton on a visit to the site in August 1905, at which point he made a survey of the ring.|$|E

Thirteen participants from four gyms in Melbourne, Australia, were purposefully selected for in-depth interviews, where detailed case histories were solicited, and data were analysed using a narrative coding model. Results indicated that the two most highly valued forms of capital were bodily capital and psychological capital. All 13 participants cited gym work as {{the means by which}} they built <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>looking</b> and <b>better</b> functioning body. They also advised that gym work had strengthened their selfesteem and psychological resilience, which, in turn, enabled them to present themselves more confidently in their various social roles outside the gym. In contrast, these 13 gym users accrued low levels of cultural and symbolic capital through their activities, and contrary to previous studies, also secured little social capital from gym work...|$|R
40|$|Title: Extension of Kalman filter Author: Pavel Tlustý Department: Department of Probability and Mathematical Statistics Supervisor: Mgr. Zdeněk Hlávka, Ph. D. Supervisor's e-mail address: hlavka@karlin. mff. cuni. cz Abstract: In {{this thesis}} {{we try to}} explain a theory of the Kalman filter and apply it on European CALL and PUT options. In the first chapter, we sum- marize a general theory of the Kalman filter for a linear state space and an {{extension}} of the Kalman filter for a non-linear state space. In the second chapter, we estimate the state price density from prices of European CALL options and European PUT options. In the third chapter, we mention ap- plications of the previous theory on the real data sets. Chapter 4 concerns smoothing techniques that are used to obtain <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>looking</b> (smoother) state price density estimates.
