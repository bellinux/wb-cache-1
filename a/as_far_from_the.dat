5|$|This {{beautiful}} species, {{which is}} sufficiently characterised to {{distinguish it from}} every other individual of the class, is copiously produced in Dutch Guiana, about 300 paces from the sea, and nearly <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left {{bank of the river}} of Surinam. It was communicated to me by the elder Vaillant, who discovered it in 1755 on some raised ground which was never overflowed by the highest tides, and is formed of a very fine white sand, covered with a thin stratum of earth. The prodigious quantity of individuals of this species which grow at the same time, the very different periods of their expansion, the brilliancy and the varied shades of their colours, present a prospect truly picturesque. The fungus was later placed in a new genus, Dictyophora, in 1809 by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux; it was then known for many years as Dictyophora indusiata. Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck placed the species in Hymenophallus in 1817, as H.indusiatus. Both genera were eventually returned to synonyms of Phallus and the species is now known again by its original name.|$|E

25|$|While Hardy wrote poetry {{throughout}} his life and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898.

During his lifetime, Hardy's poetry was acclaimed by younger poets (particularly the Georgians) who viewed him as a mentor. After his death his poems were lauded by Ezra Pound, W. H. Auden and Philip Larkin.|$|E
25|$|A {{conclusion}} {{from the}} above is that the buckling load of a column may be increased by changing its material to one with a higher modulus of elasticity (E), or changing {{the design of the}} column's cross section so as to increase the its moment of inertia. The latter can be done without increasing the weight of the column by distributing the material <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> principal axis of the column's cross section as possible. For most purposes, the most effective use of the material of a column is that of a tubular section.|$|E
25|$|Some {{observers}} {{predict that}} the English variant of Yeshivish may develop further {{to the point that}} it could become one of the historical Judeo-hybrid languages like Yiddish, Ladino or Judeo-Arabic. The Judeo-hybrid languages were spoken dialects which mixed elements of the local vernacular, Hebrew, Aramaic and Jewish religious idioms. As Yiddish was to Middle High German, Yeshivish may be to Standard American English. However, the integration of modern-day Jews with non-Jews may keep their speech from diverging <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> standard language as it did in the past.|$|E

25|$|Deinonychosaurs, {{named after}} the {{enlarged}} sickle-shaped second digit of the foot, {{are closely related to}} birds. They have two distinct families, Troodontidae and Dromaeosauridae. Troodontid fossils are known from 127 to 65Ma. They have a more slender build and longer limbs. The earliest named troodontid fossil known is Sinornithoides. Dromaeosaurid fossils are known from about 127 to 65Ma with the exception of Utahraptor. The skeletal remains of Utahraptor are about 127-144Ma. This is interesting because according to a recent cladistic analysis, Utahraptor is about <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ancestral Theropoda as it is possible to get, further than Archaeopteryx. Dromaeosaurids have a larger second digit; this family includes the well known dinosaurs Dromaeosaurus, Deinonychus and Velociraptor.|$|E
25|$|Although the Admiralty had {{instructed}} Parker to frustrate the League, by force if necessary, {{he was a}} naturally cautious person and moved slowly. He wanted to blockade the Baltic despite {{the danger of the}} combination of fleets; Nelson wanted to ignore Denmark and Sweden, who were both reluctant partners in the alliance, and instead sail to the Baltic to fight the Russians. In the end Nelson was able to persuade Sir Hyde to attack the Danish fleet currently concentrated off Copenhagen. Promised naval support for the Danes from Karlskrona, in Sweden, did not arrive perhaps because of adverse winds. The Prussians had only minimal naval forces and also could not assist. On 30 March, the British force passed through the narrows between Denmark and Sweden, sailing close to the Swedish coast to put themselves <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Danish guns as possible; fortunately for the British, the Swedish batteries remained silent.|$|E

500|$|Of all {{the planets}} in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars {{are the most}} Earth-like, due to the similar tilts of the two planets' {{rotational}} axes. The lengths of the Martian seasons are about twice those of Earth's because Mars's greater distance from the Sun leads to the Martian year being about two Earth years long. Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of about [...] at the winter polar caps to highs of up to [...] in equatorial summer. The wide range in temperatures {{is due to the}} thin atmosphere which cannot store much solar heat, the low atmospheric pressure, and the low thermal inertia of Martian soil. The planet is 1.52 times <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun as Earth, resulting in just 43% of the amount of sunlight.|$|E
500|$|The South Drawing Room is at {{the front}} of the house on the West Wing. In earlier times the room had served as a dining room, despite it being about <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> kitchen as possible. This section of the house was largely remodelled under Henry Holland, but it retains its Georgian elegance today, [...] "gilded to within an inch of its life", with walls painted in a duck egg blue colour with forest green drapery and peach-patterned sofas. A large mirror with an {{exquisite}} gold frame stands between the two windows. The fireplace was added by the Chelsea stonemason Lancelot Edward Wood in 1802, and the ceiling by master builder Benjamin Broadbent of Leicester in 1865. The ceiling in the Yellow Drawing Room, also known as the Rubens Room because of its four Rubens paintings, is also attributed to Broadbent. There are numerous paintings on the walls, including fifteen Joshua Reynolds portraits and a miniature portrait in one of the alcoves of Admiral Lord Nelson, an associate of George John, Second Earl Spencer. Although Higgerson, the night watchman, guarded the place from 8 pm to 8 am, in 1954 one of the lesser valuable paintings in the South Drawing Room was stolen in the night.|$|E
500|$|Meyer {{moved to}} Boulder, Colorado because he [...] "just {{wanted to get}} <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> New York {{environment}} as [...] could." [...] There, he wrote a film script for Letterman; the project was dropped due {{to the success of}} Letterman's show, although several of its jokes were later used in The Simpsons when no other ideas could be found. He spent time [...] "skiing, going to poetry readings, and trying to meet girls from the University of Colorado." [...] He founded the humor zine Army Man; he wrote the eight-page first issue almost wholly by himself, publishing just 200 copies which he gave to his friends. Meyer had been disappointed by the decline of the National Lampoon and felt that there was no longer a magazine which has the sole purpose of being funny. By starting Army Man he [...] "tried to make something that had no agenda other than to make you laugh." [...] He claimed that [...] " [...] didn't know what [...] was doing," [...] and reprinted material without obtaining permission, including a review of Cannonball Run II. He added: [...] "I like to think that Army Man was somewhere between a real publication and a very irresponsible, lawbreaking zine." [...] Army Man gained a strong following and was listed on Rolling Stones [...] "Hot List" [...] in 1989. Meyer noted: [...] "The only rule was that the stuff had to be funny and pretty short. To me, the quintessential Army Man joke was one of John Swartzwelder's: 'They can kill the Kennedys. Why can't they make a cup of coffee that tastes good?' It's a horrifying idea juxtaposed with something really banal-and yet there's a kind of logic to it. It's illuminating because it's kind of how Americans see things: Life's a big jumble, but somehow it leads to something I can consume. I love that." [...] Meyer suspended publication with the third issue, after offers to take the magazine national made him fear that it would lose its best qualities. According to The Believer: [...] "In comedy circles, [...] taken on almost mythological proportions." [...] This was met with varying reactions from Meyer, who felt [...] "embarrassed when people build it up as this monumental work of comedy. It was just a silly little escapade, never meant to be enshrined." ...|$|E
