40|$|This {{article focuses}} on primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk, which is the facet <b>of</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk that has created the most {{difficult}} problems, post-Springrose. The primary problem in understanding primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk is in determining {{its relationship to the}} duty issue in tort law. A secondary and dependent problem is in determining the appropriate relationship between judge and jury for purposes <b>of</b> applying primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk principles. Part two of the article begins with a short history of some of the key Minnesota cases involving <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk in the employment context. Those decisions, perhaps more than any others, indicate the complexity and inconsistent treatment <b>of</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> the risk in Minnesota. Part three discusses Springrose v. Willmore, the first Minnesota post-comparative negligence act case to deal with <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk. Part four discusses the Minnesota Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> the risk cases decided after Springrose, primarily to illustrate the substantial inconsistency in the court 2 ̆ 7 s approach to primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> the risk issues. Part five discusses two illuminating Minnesota Court of Appeals cases that highlight the problems that can arise when Springrose is not tightly followed. That discussion is followed by part six, which is an analysis of a recent Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion that devoted a substantial amount of space in an attempt to delineate primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk principles in Minnesota. It provides an interesting insight into the difficulty that courts have in determining the place <b>of</b> primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk in Minnesota law. The seventh part of the article examines the problems involved in instructing juries on primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk. Given Minnesota 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on New Jersey law in Springrose, part eight compares Minnesota and New Jersey law, speculating on what the face of how Minnesota primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk law would look had it followed more tightly the New Jersey Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s abolition <b>of</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk. Part nine compares Minnesota with the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability, which abolishes primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk...|$|R

5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default <b>assumptions</b> <b>of</b> heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E
5|$|Because of this {{experiment}} Hendrik Lorentz {{proposed that the}} motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus to contract along its length in the direction of motion, and he further assumed, that the time variable for moving systems must also be changed accordingly ("local time"), which led to the formulation of the Lorentz transformation. Based on Lorentz's aether theory, Henri Poincaré (1900) showed that this local time (to first order in v/c) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, he speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the <b>assumptions</b> <b>of</b> Lorentz's theory are all confirmed. In 1905, Poincaré brought Lorentz's aether theory into full observational agreement with the principle of relativity.|$|E

It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because {{it is based on the}} questionable <b>assumptions</b> <b>of</b> perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the cosmological principle) and that only the gravitational interaction is significant. However, the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, R grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when R had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the Big Bang model of the Universe. Understanding the singularity of the Big Bang likely requires a quantum theory of gravity, which has not yet been formulated.|$|E

5|$|A person's {{experience}} in managing sexuality after the injury relies {{not only on}} physical factors like severity and level of the injury, but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as sexual experience and attitudes about sex. As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians {{must take into account}} factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, cultural, and social factors. Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatments—particularly when cultural attitudes and <b>assumptions</b> <b>of</b> patients and care providers conflict. Health professionals must be sensitive to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, and emotionally supporting. Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are heterosexual or to exclude LGBTQ patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care. Academic research on sexuality and disability under-represents LGBTQ perspectives as well.|$|E

40|$|<b>Assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk has {{presented}} courts with considerable difficulty in defining its theoretical justification {{and its relationship}} to tort duty limitations and to the defense of contributory negligence. In Minnesota and elsewhere, <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk has been applied inconsistently. Sometimes it seems to relate to the duty issue and sometimes it is linked to the defense of contributory negligence, but without a clear differentiation of which issue is involved. In Minnesota specifically, the Minnesota Supreme Court has acknowledged that inconsistency and the difficulty in applying the concept in cases spanning several decades. This article focuses on primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk, which is the facet <b>of</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk that has created the most difficult problems, post-Springrose. The primary problem in understanding primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk is in determining its relationship to the duty issue in tort law.

50|$|The court {{recognized}} {{two categories}} <b>of</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk. The first was primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk, where the defendant owes no {{duty of care}} to protect the plaintiff from the risk that caused the injury. The second category is secondary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk, where the defendant does owe a duty of care to the plaintiff and the plaintiff knowingly encounters the risk created by the defendant's breach of that duty. The court held that secondary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk had been merged into the comparative negligence scheme adopted in Li v. Yellow Cab Co. of California, but that primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk could still serve as a defense to negligence. The court determined that in a touch football game, the only duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff is to not be reckless and wanton. Because the plaintiff was injured in {{the normal course of}} the touch football game, the injury fell under primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> risk and she was barred from recovery.|$|R
5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} model with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how monetary policy could have an impact in a model with long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the <b>assumptions</b> <b>of</b> staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi {{occupation}} of Poland {{was among the}} most brutal of the war, resulting in death of more than 3 million ethnic Poles and about 3 million Polish Jews. The six million Jewish, Roman Catholic and Orthodox Poles represented nearly 17 percent of the country's population. Poles were one of Hitler's first extermination targets, as he outlined in an August 22, 1939 speech to Wehrmacht commanders before the invasion. Intelligentsia, socially prominent and influential people were primarily targeted, although ethnic Poles and other Slavic groups were also killed en masse. Hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholic and Orthodox Poles were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau and other concentration camps, and the intelligentsia were the first targets of the Einsatzgruppen death squads. The anti-Polish campaign culminated in the near-complete destruction of Warsaw, ordered by Hitler and Himmler in 1944. The original <b>assumptions</b> <b>of</b> Generalplan Ost were based on plans to exterminate around 85% (over 20 million) of ethnically Polish citizens of Poland, with the remaining 15% to be used as slaves.|$|E

We propose a more realistic game-theoretical model for analysing knowledge-sharing, based on alternative assumptions, that is, heterogeneity of knowledge, multi-stage negotiations, knowledge value realized via production functions, the need for side payments, and the working of nature and discount factors. Our model may help in establishing new firms on the basis of existing knowledge owned by companies and their employees...|$|R
