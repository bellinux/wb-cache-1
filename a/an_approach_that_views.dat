40|$|Abstract. Emotions can be {{considered}} inextricably linked to embodied appraisals- perceptions of bodily states that inform agents of how they are faring in the world relative to their own well-being. Emotionappraisals are thus relational phenomena the relevance {{of which can be}} learned or evolutionarily selected for given a reliable coupling between agent-internal and environmental states. An emotion-appraisal attentional disposition permits agents to produce behaviour that exploits such couplings allowing for adaptive agent performance across agentenvironment interactions. This chapter discusses emotions in terms of dynamical processes whereby attentional dispositions are considered central to an understanding of behaviour. The need to reconcile a dynamical systems perspective with <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>views</b> emotions as attentional dispositions representative of embodied relational phenomena (embodied appraisals) is argued for. Attention and emotion are considered to be features of adaptive agent behaviour that are interdependent in their temporal, structural and organizational relations.

In this Note, I revisit and reinterpret the suggestion by Professor Sherman J. Clark in his article, An Accuser-Obligation Approach to the Confrontation Clause, 1 that we should view the Confrontation Clause primarily as an obligation of the accuser rather than a right of the accused. Specifically, I reevaluate Clark’s proposition using a gendered lens, ultimately suggesting a novel {{solution to the problem}} of the “victimless” domestic violence prosecution that would extend beyond the domestic violence context. <b>An</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>views</b> the Confrontation Clause as an accuser’s obligation, and focuses on the values of honor, courage, and respect, while simultaneously taking a gender-conscious approach in defining those values, will produce a body of jurisprudence that can satisfy the courts, academics, and advocates alike...|$|E

40|$|Background: Person-centredness is <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>views</b> each {{individual}} {{as a unique}} being, and {{is supported by the}} values of mutual respect and individual right to self-determination. This approach is currently a prevailing principle in policy, education and practice settings globally. The relevance of person-centredness to postgraduate student learning is immense, as new graduate nurses are expected to assume leadership and advocacy roles in healthcare environments and engage with key stakeholders in the exchange of knowledge to inform practice. The application of person-centred practices by faculty within postgraduate nursing programmes is therefore instrumental in providing students with the necessary supportive environments to acquire the skills for person-centred care. Method: Practice development was used as a foundation for implementing innovative teaching methods for postgraduate nursing students. Nurses enrolled in the advancement of professional nursing practice seminars and practicum, participating in various active learning and critical reflection activities throughout the semester. Implications for practice: Practice development provides an innovative foundation for postgraduate nursing education Educators should consider this unique and person-centred approach {{as an alternative to the}} typical pedagogical approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of the health literacy concept to a functional relationship with text, does not acknowledge the range of information sources that people draw from {{in order to make}} informed decision about their health and treatment.

Health information is experienced by patients as a chronic health condition landscape, and develops from three information sources; namely epistemic, social and corporeal sources. Participants in both studies used activities that involved orienting, sharing and creating information to map this landscape which was used to inform their decision-making. These findings challenge the traditional conceptions of health literacy and suggest <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>views</b> the landscape of chronic illness as being socially, physically and contextually constructed.

This article asks whose rights these laws intend to protect: the rights-holders could consist only of living individuals whose bodies will become the corpses at issue or could include the dead themselves. Whether rights to posthumous {{bodily integrity}} belong only to the living or survive death leads to three types of insight.

Second, to the extent that some laws are more consistent with <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>views</b> the dead as rights-holders versus only the living (or vice versa), this may help elucidate why we protect posthumous bodily integrity. Third, if one has an opinion about whether the dead are capable of having rights, this has implications for how one thinks laws protecting posthumous bodily integrity should be structured. For example, a revision to anatomical gift legislation is proposed that is more easily justified than current legislation if one views the dead as incapable of having rights...|$|E

To achieve this result, jurisdictions need to adopt <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>views</b> the insurance company as the insured 2 ̆ 7 s ally, rather than adversary, even when the insured is defending a lawsuit that the insurer might later exclude from coverage. Part II of this Comment describes how and why D 2 ̆ 6 O policies differ from general liability policies, which also involve litigation concerning privileged information.

40|$|Software {{development}} today faces several challenges. There is {{a critical}} need to reduce cost, effort, and time-to-market of software products, but, at the same time, complexity and size of products are rapidly increasing and customers are requesting more and more quality products tailored to their individual needs. Experience of many software organizations shows that the traditional way of software development is not efficient enough to meet all these challenges. Here, traditional software development means that all development activities are performed {{in the context of}} a development project and thus focus only on the particular software ultimately delivered by a single project. Hence, an approach is needed that provides a point-of-view orthogonal to the project structure and thus allows commonalities among projects to be identified and effort to be shared between several projects. Software product line engineering is such <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>views</b> the software products delivered by an organization as members of the same product family, which share several common characteristics. It typically brings a new development paradigm to organizations that affects many diverse aspects of the whole software life-cycle, as well as on the structure of software development organizations. The PoLITe (Product Line Implementation Technologies) project 1, however, has been set up to explore only one aspect of product line engineering: the implementation of software product lines. In this report, implementation approaches are generally characterized by three technological dimensions: configuration management, component technologies, and programming languages, and its overall goal is the optimization of the level of automation achieved during implementation activities. An ideal approach completely automates implementation tasks and thus generates implementation artifacts from models produced by ealier development tasks like architecture or design models. Consequently, automation also enables software to be developed indepedent of particular technologies and thus improves flexibility, which is key for a rapid and efficient development of new software variants...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} theoretical foundation and empirical {{significance of the}} social resource model of political participation, <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>views</b> political participation as an outcome of individuals? use of social resources created by social connectedness. Building on the decomposition {{of the concept of}} ?social capital,? I explicate the mechanisms through which non-political resources?formal membership, social trust, talk and tolerance?function to facilitate political behaviors. In addition, I examine how such social resources enhance or substitute for other resources that are already established as individual-level determinants of political participation, such as formal education or mass media use. I employ three datasets that include measures of social and individual resources with respect to political participation: The Social Capital Benchmark Survey (2000), the National Election Study (2002), and the American Citizen Participation Study (1990). Results show that political (dis) engagement can be meaningfully explained by understanding why some people are better or more poorly able to utilize certain forms of social resources, regardless of or beyond their individual capabilities or options. It is important to note, however, that different forms or dimensions of social relations contribute differently not only to the generation of social resources but also to political mobilization. In addition, this dissertation shows that social resources reinforce the effects of individual capital on political participation. Most of all, the structural and communicative forms of social resources add to the political reservoir of those who are highly educated. The significant interaction effects of television use and social resources support television?s ?time displacement? and ?worldview? explanation of participation inequality. In future research, the nexus where social resources meet individual resources should be the focal point for the study and development of the social resource model of political participation...|$|E

Contrasting the four labour processes with various measures of job quality produces 18 job types that reduce to one of three job quality categories: good jobs, bad jobs and decent jobs.

40|$|Romance corpus {{linguistics}} {{and language}} change – {{an introduction to}} the present volume One of the main achievements of structuralism {{is said to be the}} distinction between diachronic and synchronic linguistics and the preference given to the synchronic perspective, thus shifting the interest of linguists from the description and explanation of instability in language towards <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>views</b> language as a rather stable system with in-built complex but balanced functionalities; a view that only the synchronic snapshot may catch. This approach has been further developed in subsequent schools of structuralist linguistics, namely in generative theories which have arrived at highly sophisticated formal representations of how language functions at a given point of time. These formalizations, although capable of further development and undergoing indeed constant revision and updating, are by themselves rather static when trying to model the processes which are going on when language is used. Such approaches to language in the structuralist tradition face a crucial dilemma: in order to be able to describe language as a système où tout se tient, they have to postulate a state of language devoid of its quite obvious inherent dynamics and tendencies of change. How should we conceive of the interrelation between the layers of a well-organized language system identified by the structuralist in the diachrony of a given language? How can axiomatic stability and empirical instability be reconciled? Some linguists try to resolve this dilemma identifying variation as the culprit leading to language change while others emphasize language acquisition and its different stages as reminiscence of former linguistic changes before reaching the comparatively stable system that the synchronicist is interested in. The problem faced by structuralism regarding language change may in part be attributed to the fundamental question of what counts as evidence in linguistic...|$|E

It deals with political action as a special form of social action. The social actor looked at in {{its role as a}} political actor is the economic organization. The political activity of economic organizations is discussed in relation to a specific situation of societal conflict, modern technical controversy, and as an activity that is influenced by and related to society. The theoretical-analytical perspective in which this discussion approaches the issue of business political activity is the organization-environment perspective of 'neo'-institutionalist organizational sociology. The adoption of <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>views</b> the political activity of economic organizations as reflective of and responsive to the organizations’ wider societal environment is connected with the following two research objectives. First, the study seeks to counter the continual neglect within the field of business political activity research of the influence of social and cultural factors on the political involvement of economic organizations. The bulk of existing research in the field comes from the political and management sciences and investigates business political activity in terms of a power-strategic relationship between business institutions and institutional politics. Little attention is devoted to the interface between the business institution and society as a whole system nor to the broader role played by cultural currents, motivations, and symbolic meanings in shaping business political activity. Second, the thesis seeks to contribute to the work that social scientists have carried out in the field of new social movements research on {{the way in which the}} protest actors under investigation challenge the boundaries of institutional politics. It does so by discussing business political activity in the sphere of non-institutional politics as forming part of the main effect of the institutionalization of the new social movements. This effect is determined as the »renaissance« of the public sphere, as the rise of public discourse (Eder 1996 a: 205) ...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study on}} the role of the Collector in the process of rural {{development}} in Bangladesh within the conceptual framework of comparative field administration. The Collector occupies a pivotal position in field administration that is comparable to that of the Prefect. Research suggests that (a) the role of the Collector is bound up less with supporting stability than with generating popular enthusiasm for rural development and (b) the formal structure does not reveal the functions of the Collector in the sphere of rural development. Collector's role in rural development is alluded to in the literature of field administration but is yet to be researched. This role cannot be explained by static models of field administration or by <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>views</b> the Collector as a paradigm of political field administrator concerned with regulatory functions. Evidence suggests that the role has a continuity that is best explained by an analysis of the Collector's relationship with the rural development process in terms of interaction among national political leadership, the field administrative system and participation by the villagers. Chapter I deals with the origin of field administrative system and analyses the circumstances that led to the mix between regulatory and development functions. Chapter II analyses the crucial role played by the Collector in the process of building up institutional framework for rural development during the years 1950 to 1971. Chapter III describes the continuity of the Collector's role in rural development, the failed attempt to introduce District Governor system and the relationship between the Collectoral pattern and development ministries during the years 1976 to 1979. Chapter IV deals with the role of the Collector in evocating popular enthusiasm for voluntary participation in labour-intensive schemes between the years 1974 to 1979. Chapter V argues the case for a micro-level under-standing of the cruciality of the Collector's role in the process of rural development based on voluntary labour-utilisation strategy. Chapter VI explains the theme of incompatibility of the colonial pattern of field administration in generating popular enthusiasm for development in terms of its relationship with the rural society, summarises the major points from the perspective of comparative field administration and indicates the most recent trends with regard to the future role of the Collector...|$|E

Given the failure of current drugs to effectively treat chronic pain, {{which are based on}} suppressing aberrant neuronal excitability, we propose in this review <b>an</b> integrated <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>views</b> pain not solely originating from neuronal activation but also the result of a complex interaction between the nervous, immune, and endocrine systems.

Finally integrating the concept of perinatal programming into the pain management field is a necessary step to develop and target interventions to reduce the suffering associated with chronic pain. We present clinical and animal findings from our laboratory (and others) demonstrating the importance of the microbial and relational environment in programming pain responsiveness later in life via action on hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activity, peripheral and central immune system, spinal and supraspinal mechanisms, and the autonomic nervous system...|$|R
