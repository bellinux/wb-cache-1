5000|$|Older European cars used {{high voltage}} (or steam - {{supplied}} by steam locomotive (some diesels and electrics also had steam boilers fitted), {{there were also}} steam generator cars in use and some cars were fitted with coal- or oil-fired boiler) only for heating, while light, fans and other low-current supply (e.g. shaver sockets in bathrooms) power was provided by <b>axle-driven</b> <b>generator.</b> Today, with the developments in solid state electronics (thyristors and IGBTs), most cars have switching power supplies which take any RIC voltage (1.0 - 3.0 kV DC or /50 Hz) and can supply all the needed lower voltages. Low voltages differ depending on manufacturers, but typical values are: ...|$|E
50|$|The Rosenberg {{generator}} is {{very similar}} to the Metadyne generator, both in its construction and its electrical connection. It generally does not have a compensation winding, so that the whole of the armature reaction opposes the initial excitation. Parts of the magnetic circuit are normally not laminated, which creates delays between excitations and fluxes, but the machines are used in applications where a quick response is not essential. Their predominant use has been in trains, where they are axle-driven, and used to provide lighting and the charging of batteries. An <b>axle-driven</b> <b>generator</b> is subject to variable speeds and changes in the direction of rotation, but the characteristics of the machine allow it to produce useful energy down to very low speeds. At slow speeds, the output voltage increases with the square of the speed, but the magnetic circuit soon becomes saturated, resulting in much smaller increases as the speed increases. When used in circuits which include batteries charged from the output, a rectifier or reverse-current cut-out is normally required to prevent discharge of the batteries through the generator at very low speeds, or when the train stops.|$|E
25|$|Two-stage {{air-conditioning}} {{was fitted}} for summer, and heating elements placed underneath the carpet for winter. Those systems, {{along with those}} for lighting and announcements, were powered by three-phase alternators, fixed to the underframe of each carriage. These required refuelling, but were cheaper and more reliable than the <b>axle-driven</b> <b>generators</b> used most earlier vehicles.|$|R
50|$|To {{provide for}} the upgrade, a new design of steel {{carriages}} was developed, to replace {{the worst of the}} E type sleeping carriages. The first car, Allambi, entered service in 1949 as a roomette sleeper with a central corridor and ten sleeping compartments either side, with room for 20 passengers. The car was fitted with airconditioning and electric lighting, powered by <b>axle-driven</b> <b>generators.</b>|$|R
50|$|Throughout the {{remainder}} of the age of steam and into the early diesel era, passenger cars were heated by low pressure saturated steam supplied by the locomotive with the electricity for car lighting and ventilation being derived from batteries charged by <b>axle-driven</b> <b>generators</b> on each car or from engine-generator sets mounted under the carbody. Starting in the 1930s, air conditioning became available on railcars, with the energy to run them being provided by mechanical power take offs from the axle, small dedicated engines or propane.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970's The Overland {{required}} {{head end power}} for air conditioning and lighting. Prior to this time, all electrical power had been supplied by <b>axle-driven</b> <b>generators.</b> As a result, the two railways between them built four PCO vans, numbered 1 - 4, in 1970. They were Joint Stock vehicles owned and maintained jointly by the VR and SAR, and their later, respective incarnations of VicRail and V/Line (VR), and Australian National (SAR). Each had two [...] diesel generators and could carry 10 t of luggage. In 1990 the V/Line N class locomotives, which had their own head end power units, took over hauling the Overland and the PCO vans were put into storage.|$|R
