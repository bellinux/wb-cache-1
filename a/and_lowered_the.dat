5|$|During Commando Hunt V (10 October 1970 to 30 April 1971) Air Force {{intelligence}} claimed 16,266 trucks {{destroyed and}} another 7,700 damaged {{during the dry}} season offensive. The Seventh Air Force headquarters in Saigon, chagrined by the enormity of the figures, recomputed them <b>and</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> estimate to 11,000 destroyed and 8,000 damaged. In fact, there were only 2,500–3,000 PAVN trucks operating on the trail during 1970–1971, each carrying approximately four tons of materiel.|$|E
5|$|It was a mad waste. The colonists {{in their}} greed for more grass seed and sheep pasture burned {{millions}} of pounds worth of timber. They recklessly destroyed the wonderful {{beauty of the}} bush, baring the soil until it was carried away by landslides, <b>and</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> rainfall, and laid waste the homes of countless sweet songsters.|$|E
5|$|Outside the National Day {{celebrations}} period, {{the national}} flag of Singapore is flown from all buildings housing government and government-related departments, such as armed forces installations, court houses, offices, and educational institutions.

5|$|There {{used to be}} {{two large}} geysers fields in Nevada—Beowawe and Steamboat Springs—but they were {{destroyed}} by the installation of nearby geothermal power plants.

5|$|On June1, CSU {{released}} an updated forecast, {{increasing the number}} of predicted named storms to 8, due to the early formation of Tropical Storm Ana, while keeping the predictions for hurricanes and major hurricanes at 3 and 1, respectively; the ACE index forecast was also kept at 40 units. Probabilities of a major hurricane making landfall on various coastal areas remained below average. On August5, TSR updated their forecast <b>and</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> number of hurricanes developing within the basin to 4, with only 1 forecasted to be a major hurricane. The ACE index was also reduced to 44 units.|$|E
5|$|The England openers Cyril Washbrook and Len Hutton {{were given}} a loud {{reception}} as they walked out to bat, particularly the Yorkshire local Hutton. They {{had to face the}} Australian opening pair of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller without the aid of sightscreen. It was the first time some of the Australians had played in a first-class match without a sightscreen, and those cricketers would later have to bat without its assistance. It was believed the Yorkshire administrators were reluctant to install a sightscreen as it would have taken up space <b>and</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> capacity of the ground, and thus the gate takings.|$|E

5|$|The {{historic}} {{wealth of}} the city is manifested in palaces, mansions and other lavish residences. The main palaces are El Badi Palace, the Royal Palace and Bahia Palace. Riads (Moroccan mansions) are common in Marrakesh. Based on the design of the Roman villa, they are characterized by an open central garden courtyard surrounded by high walls. This construction provided the occupants with privacy <b>and</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> temperature within the building. Buildings of note inside the Medina are Riad Argana, Riad Obry, Riad Enija, Riad el Mezouar, Riad Frans Ankone, Dar Moussaine, Riad Lotus, Riad Elixir, Riad les Bougainvilliers, Riad Dar Foundouk, Dar Marzotto, Dar Darma, and Riad Pinco Pallino. Others of note outside the Medina area include Ksar Char Bagh, Amanjena, Villa Maha, Dar Ahlam, Dar Alhind and Dar Tayda.|$|E
5|$|The skyway was a {{constraint}} in {{the building}} of the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951. The turnpike had to be built low enough to provide enough clearance underneath the skyway, but high enough to then provide sufficient clearance over the nearby Passaic River. Turnpike engineers could have built over the skyway (at a much higher cost) or under the skyway's trusses; the latter option was chosen. As part of a 2005 seismic retrofit project, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority lowered the Passaic River Viaduct Bridge on its easterly alignment to increase vertical clearance and allow for full-width shoulders underneath the Pulaski Skyway. Engineers replaced the bearings <b>and</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> turnpike bridge by , without shutting it to traffic.|$|E

They hoisted <b>and</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> anchor, and docked and undocked the ship.

They executed the orders of the master, and would command in his place if he was sick or absent.|$|E
25|$|Using DC placed severe {{restrictions}} on the distance power could be transmitted due to power losses. With DC {{there was no way}} to transform power to high voltages, which would have reduced the current <b>and</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> transmission losses. Power can be safely generated to about 2000 volts, but this is a dangerous voltage for household use. With alternating current voltage can be changed up or down using a transformer. AC power began being widely introduced in the 1890s.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the physics}} and {{metallurgy}} of boilers were poorly understood, steamboats were prone to boiler explosions that killed {{hundreds of people}} between the 1810s and 1840s. In 1838, legislation was enacted that mandated boiler inspections by federal agents under the threat of revocation of the operator's navigation licenses <b>and</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> threshold for liability in suits arising from such accidents. While Americans long resisted any government's power to regulate private property, these new rules demonstrated that many Americans believed that property rights did not override civil rights and set the precedent for future federal safety regulations.|$|E

25|$|Three new {{sections}} {{were laid out}} for burial in 1895. The hydrants installed in 1890 were all replaced after they unexpectedly deteriorated, and both fountains had to be repaired and their leaking basins cemented. The fencing was also proving problematic. The 1883 fencing along the east, west, and north sides was in disrepair and needed painting. The Woodland Avenue fencing, installed in 1877, was completely replace after the sidewalk was regraded <b>and</b> <b>lowered.</b> <b>The</b> cemetery's Main Drive, which had been macadamized some years earlier, was now impassable after spring and fall rains. Cemetery officials asked the city to pave Main Drive with asphalt or brick.|$|E
25|$|Although {{conditions}} for intensification were present, convection {{associated with the}} depression weakened significantly by September28. Forecasts for the system became increasingly complicated due {{to the formation of}} Tropical Depression Nineteen-W to the east-south-east. Later that day, the motion of the storm shifted to the west-northwest in response to a subtropical ridge north of the depression. The center of circulation had become nearly devoid of convection late on September28, with only the western portion of the system featuring shower and thunderstorm activity. By the morning of September29, convection redeveloped around the center of 18W and the JTWC determined that the system had intensified into a tropical storm, with winds peaking at 65km/h (40mph 1-minute sustained). However, in post storm analysis, the JTWC determined that the depression had not intensified into a tropical storm <b>and</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> peak wind-speeds to 55km/h (35mph).|$|E
25|$|In 1979 {{a second}} oil shock nearly doubled {{the price of}} {{imported}} oil to Brazil <b>and</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> terms of trade further. The rise in world interest rates sharply increased Brazil's balance of payments problem {{and the size of}} the foreign debt. Nevertheless, the government continued borrowing, mainly to face an increasing debt burden, while it tried vainly to maintain the high-growth strategy. At the beginning of the 1980s, however, the foreign-debt problem became acute, leading to the introduction of a program to generate growing trade surpluses in order to service the foreign debt. The program was achieved by reducing growth and, with it, imports, and by expanding exports. As a result, in 1981 real GDP declined by 4.4 percent. The 1982 Mexican debt crisis ended Brazil's access to international financial markets, increasing the pressure for economic adjustment.|$|E

There were reports in the media that Tuđman himself participated in the coverup. The appeals chamber of the ICTY ruled that Blaškić did not have command responsibility for the massacre <b>and</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> initial sentence (in 2000) of 45 years to nine years of imprisonment.

25|$|In {{discussing}} {{the evolution of}} S. mutans, {{it is imperative to}} include the role humans have played and the co-evolution that has occurred between the two species. As humans evolved anthropologically, the bacteria evolved biologically. It is widely accepted that the advent of agriculture in early human populations provided the conditions S. mutans needed to evolve into the virulent bacteria it is today. Agriculture introduced fermented foods, as well as more carbohydrate rich foods, into the diets of historic human populations. These new foods introduced new bacteria to the oral cavity and created new environmental conditions. For example, Lactobacillus or Leuconostoc are typically found in foods such as yogurt and wine. Also, consuming more carbohydrates increased the amount of sugars available to S. mutans for metabolism <b>and</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> pH of the oral cavity. This new acidic habitat would select for those bacteria that could survive and reproduce at a lower pH.|$|E
