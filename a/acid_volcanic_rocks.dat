40|$|The lithologies {{present in}} the Rambler Area are described, a {{sequence}} of lithofacies units is defined, and a simplistic model to explain {{the evolution of the}} rocks in the area is proposed. As a generalisation the rocks dip towards the northeast and become younger in that direction. The base of the sequence consists of basic (Komatiitic) lavas, and this is overlain by basic pyroclastic <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks.</b> Towards the end of the basic pyroclastic stage a centre of acid volcanism developed, and the sulphide deposits can be related to exhalite activity during the waning stages of acid volcanism. The termination of basic pyroclastic volcanism was followed by deposition of a sequence of basic volcanogenic sediment and/or waterlain tuff, and extrusion of local pillow lava units. Abundant basic intrusions may be contemporaneous with the build-up of the volcanic pile. The volcanic sequence was intruded by the Burlington Granodiorite on the west, and Cape Brule Porphyry on the east. [...] All the rocks in the area have been subjected to polyphaser deformation and to metamorphism in the upper greenschist facies. The first two deformation involved intense strain with 1 <K< 00, and large fold structures were recognized relating to the second and third deformation episodes. The shape and orientation of the sulphide deposits have been modified during deformation; and the ore deposits are elongate parallel to F₂ and F₃ fold axes, and to the Z axis of the deformation ellipsoid. [...] The Ming ore body is a Cu, Au, Ag bearing sulphide deposit, and occurs {{at the top of the}} <b>acid</b> <b>volcanic</b> <b>rock</b> unit in the area.

30|$|Wettability of <b>acid</b> <b>volcanic</b> {{reservoir}} <b>rock</b> {{from the}} Hailar Oilfield, China, was studied with crude oils of different acid numbers generated from an original crude oil with an acid number of 3.05 mg KOH/g. The modified oils and their resultant acid numbers were: A (2.09 mg KOH/g), B (0.75 mg KOH/g), C (0.47 mg KOH/g), D (0.30 mg KOH/g), and E (0.18 mg KOH/g). Contact angles and improved Amott water indexes were measured {{to study the}} effects of temperature and acid number on the wettability of the <b>acid</b> <b>volcanic</b> reservoir <b>rock.</b> Experimental results indicated that the wettability was not sensitive to variation in temperature when using the same oil, but the acid number of the crude oil was a key factor in changing the wettability of the rock. The Amott water index, Iw was an exponential function of the acid number, and the Amott water index increased as the acid number decreased (i.e. Amott water index exponentially decreased with the acid number increase). The Iw value of the core saturated with oil A, with an acid number of 2.09 mg KOH/g, ranged from 0.06 to 0.11, which indicated low water wetness. If the acid number of the oil decreased to 0.18 mg KOH/g, the Iw value increased to 0.95, which indicated strong water wetness. The contact angle decreased from 80 ° to 35 ° when the aid number decreased from 0.75 to 0.18 mg KOH/g, indicating a change towards more water wet conditions. The oil recovery by spontaneous imbibition of water also increased as the acid number of the oil decreased. As an example, at 80 °C, the recovery of Oil A with an acid number of 2.09 mg KOH/g was only 7.6 %, while Oil E with an acid number of 0.18 mg KOH/g produced 56.4 %, i.e. an increase of 48.8 %.|$|R

There is also a sill of porphyry intruded into the volcanic rocks on the east and south slopes. The rocks dip to the south west at an angle of 20°. This dip is perpendicular to the long extension of the mountain, showing that it is the strata in the rock that has determined the shape of the mountain.|$|E

It consists of grey silicified limestones and dolomites interbedded with dark grey crystalline schists and light coloured quartzites that display evidence of amphibolite grade metamorphism. The Hajigak iron deposit is hosted by the Upper Proterozoic Awband Formation that, together with the underlying Kab Formation, constitutes the Qala Series, a sequence of metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks up to 4500m thick. The Kab Formation consists of dark grey sandy sericitic schists, interpreted as metamorphosed terrigenous rocks, <b>acid</b> <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> and minor beds of marble and phyllite. The Awband Formation {{is made up of}} schists (quartz-sericite, quartzchlorite-sericite, quartz-sericitechlorite and carbonaceoussericite) that are metamorphosed acid and basic tuffites and argillaceous rocks. Minor cherts and marbles also occur. The Green Schist Formation, a distinctive unit overlying the Awband Formation, consists dominantly of green chlorite schists, and quartz-sericitic schists locally intruded by granodiorites.

40|$|SUMMARY. Alkalic rhyolites with {{peralkaline}} affinities, bearing quartz and potassic feldspar pheno-crysts, {{are described}} from Iceland {{for the first}} time. Evidence from electron-probe analyses of feldspar phenocrysts indicates crystallization {{in or near the}} thermal valley of the system SiO 2 -Or-Ab. Icelandic <b>acid</b> <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> are subdivided into alkalic rhyolites, belonging to transitional nd alkalic basalt lineages, and the mildly calc-alkaline rhyolites of tholeiite lineages.

Their association with tholeiitic basalt lavas has been pointed out by Carmichael (I 963) who suggested that these one-feldspar rhyolites were typical products of the fractionation of a tholeiitic magma. For some time now, these rhyolites have come to be regarded as the typical Icelandic acid magma, but the discovery of alkalic acid lavas in western and southern Iceland has shown the compositional range of Icelandic acid volcanics to be much greater tha...|$|E

40|$|The Upper Ordovician Avoca <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> host a Kuroko-type massive {{sulphide}} deposit {{in southeast}} Co. Wicklow, Ireland. Immobile element geochemistry of lavas shows a bimodal subdivision into acid and basic groups. Basalts have characteristics of magmas from both subduction zone and enriched mantle sources, and are interpreted as {{products of the}} rifting of a volcanic arc. Rhyolites are highly enriched in HFS-elements and were originally peralkaline. Constant incompatible element ratios throughout the compositional spectrum indicate a fractional crystallization relationship between the basic and acid end members. The basaltic magmas evolved by crystallization of an assemblage in which plagioclase feldspar was an important component, producing large negative Eu anomalies. The transition to peralkalinity is marked by LREE depletion and no further increase in the Eu anomaly, which may represent the interval of minor phase precipitation and fO 2 variation seen in other peralkaline series.

The main objective was the detection of processes responsible for the geochemical evolution and mineralization throughout the area. Multivariate techniques revealed different sources of solutes (a) dissolution of calcium and magnesium carbonate minerals, (b) weathering of acid volcanic minerals, (c) alteration of manganese containing alkaline silicates, (d) leaching of halite deposits of meteoric origin, (e) contamination from agricultural and urban wastewaters, and (f) evaporative effects due to intensive irrigation.

The investigation reveals that weathering of <b>acid</b> <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> (rhyolite) and oxidation of arsenic bearing sulfide minerals are the responsible processes for high fluorine (up to 16 mg/l) and arsenic (up to 0. 12 mg/l) contents, respectively, exceeding the Mexican maximum admissible concentration for drinking water.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve our {{understanding}} of the Paleoproterozoic geodynamic evolution, a paleomagnetic study was performed on 10 sites of <b>acid</b> <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> of the Colider Suite, southwestern Amazonian Craton. These rocks have a well-dated zircon U-Pb mean age of 1789 +/- 7 Ma. Alternating field and thermal demagnetization revealed northern (southern) directions with moderate to high upward (downward) inclinations. Rock magnetism experiments and magnetic mineralogy show that this characteristic magnetization is carried by Ti-poor magnetite or by hematite that replaces magnetite by late-magmatic cleuteric alteration. Both magnetite and hematite carry the same characteristic component. The mean direction (Dm = 183. 0 degrees, Im = 53. 5 degrees, N = 10, alpha(95) = 9. 8 degrees, K = 25. 2) yielded a paleomagnetic pole located at 298. 8 degrees E, 63. 3 degrees S (alpha(95) = 10. 2 degrees, K = 23. 6), which is classified with a quality factor Q = 5. Paleogeographic reconstructions using this pole and other reliable Paleoproterozoic poles suggest that Laurentia, Baltica, North China Craton and Amazonian Craton were located in laterally contiguous positions forming a large continental mass at 1790 Ma ago.

A program of regional mapping between Beaverdell and Lumby was carried out a t a scale of 1 : 20 000 to help define geological settings of known deposits, to provide an improved geological base for a litho-geochemical study of potential source rocks, and to clarify the distribution of plateau basalts and potentially favourable underlying sediments. Mapping and sampling of basement rocks were carried out near Lassie Lake where mineralized areas have been located by Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNCI on the Fuki and Donen claims and by Lacana Mining Corporation (Norcen Energy Resources ’ option) on the Beverly claim. In the Hydraulic Lake area (see Geological Fieldwork, 19761, mapping was modified and extensive sampling of basement rocks was completed. Geological mapping in NTS area 82 L north of Hydraulic Lake showed that {{with the exception of}} Eocene (?) <b>acid</b> <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> a t Bluenose Mountain, Tertiary volcanic rocks mapped by Jones (1959) between Harris Creek and Wood and Kalamalka Lakes are olivine plateau basalts which are underlain b...|$|E

40|$|The Xiangshan U deposit, {{the largest}} {{hydrothermal}} U deposit in China, is hosted in late Jurassic felsic <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> although the U mineralization post dates the volcanics {{by at least}} 20  Ma. The mineralization coincides with intrusion of local mantle-derived mafic dykes formed during Cretaceous crustal extension in South China. Ore-forming fluids are rich in CO 2, and U in the fluid {{is thought to have}} been dissolved in the form of UO 2 (CO 3) 2 2 - and UO 2 (CO 3) 3 4 - complexes. This paper provides He and Ar isotope data of fluid inclusions in pyrites and C isotope data of calcites associated with U mineralization (pitchblende) in the Xiangshan U deposit. He isotopic compositions range between 0. 1 and 2. 0 Ra (where Ra is the 3 He/ 4 He ratio of air = 1. 39 × 10 - 6) and correlates with 40 Ar/ 36 Ar; although there is potential for significant 3 He production via 6 Li(n,α) 3 H(β) 3 He reactions in a U deposit (due to abundant neutrons), nucleogenic production cannot account for either the 3 He concentration in these fluids, nor the correlations between He and Ar isotopic compositions. It is more likely that the high 3 He/ 4 He ratios represent trapped mantle-derived gases. A mantle origin for the volatiles of Xiangshan is consistent with the δ 13 C values of calcites, which vary from - 3. 5 ‰ to - 7. 7 ‰, overlapping the range of mantle CO 2. The He, Ar and CO 2 characteristics of the ore-forming fluids responsible for the deposit are consistent with mixing between 3 He- and CO 2 -rich mantle-derived fluids and CO 2 -poor meteoric fluids. These fluids were likely produced during Cretaceous extension and dyke intrusion which permitted mantle-derived CO 2 to migrate upward and remobilize U from the <b>acid</b> <b>volcanic</b> source <b>rocks,</b> resulting {{in the formation of the}} U deposit. Subsequent decay of U within the fluid inclusions has reduced the 3 He/ 4 He ratio, and variations in U/ 3 He result in the range in 3 He/ 4 He observed with U/ 3 He ratios in the range 5 - 17 × 10 3 likely corresponding to U concentrations in the fluids < 0. 2  ppm. © 2008 Elsevier B.
