5|$|Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the Malay Archipelago was {{gradually}} {{taken over by}} the European colonial powers, beginning {{with the arrival of the}} Portuguese at Malacca in 1509. The early dominance of the Portuguese was challenged during the 17th century by the Dutch, who came to control most of the ports in the region. The Dutch established a monopoly over trade within the archipelago, particularly in spices, then the region's most important product. Other colonial powers, including the British, were limited to <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> presence.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1860, Bryan grew up {{in rural}} Illinois and in 1887 moved to Nebraska, where he practiced law and entered politics. He won {{election}} to the House of Representatives in 1890, and was re-elected in 1892, before mounting an unsuccessful US Senate run. He {{set his sights on}} higher office, believing he could be elected president in 1896 even though he remained <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> figure in the Democratic Party. In anticipation of a presidential campaign, he spent much of 1895 and early 1896 making speeches across the United States; his compelling oratory increased his popularity in his party.|$|E

5|$|Estudiantes, {{a modest}} {{neighborhood}} club and <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> team in Argentina, had an unusual style that prioritized athletic preparation and achieving results at all costs. Led by coach Osvaldo Zubeldía {{and a team}} built around figures such as Carlos Bilardo, Oscar Malbernat and Juan Ramón Verón, {{went on to become}} the first ever tricampeon of the competition. The pincharratas won their first title in 1968 by defeating Palmeiras. They successfully defended the title in 1969 and 1970 against Nacional and Peñarol, respectively. Although Peñarol was the first club to win three titles, Estudiantes were the first to win three consecutive titles.|$|E
5|$|In close {{proximity}} is the burial of Tutankhamun. This {{is perhaps the}} most famous discovery of modern Western archaeology. It was discovered here by Howard Carter on November 4, 1922, with clearance and conservation work continuing until 1932. This was the first royal tomb to be discovered that was still largely intact, although tomb robbers had entered. And until the excavation of KV63 on 10 March 2005, it considered the last major discovery in the valley. The opulence of his grave goods notwithstanding, Tutankhamun was <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> king, and other burials probably had more numerous treasures.|$|E
5|$|One {{suggested}} {{method of}} prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people. In addition, alternative pain relief medications such as aspirin are more toxic in overdose, whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.|$|E

5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{isolation of}} Callisto {{means that it}} has never been appreciably tidally heated, which has important consequences for its internal structure and evolution. Its distance from Jupiter also means that the charged-particle flux from Jupiter's magnetosphere at its surface is relatively lowabout 300 times lower than, for example, that at Europa. Hence, unlike the other Galilean moons, charged-particle irradiation has had <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> effect on Callisto's surface. The radiation level at Callisto's surface is equivalent to a dose of about 0.01 rem (0.1 mSv) per day, which is over ten times higher than Earth's average background radiation.|$|E
5|$|The oribi {{has been}} {{classified}} as Least Concern by the IUCN. The total population (as of 2008) {{is estimated at}} 750,000. However, the subspecies O. o. haggardi is listed as Vulnerable because, as of 2008, the total population is estimated at less than 10,000 mature individuals, and is feared to be declining. Hunting is <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> threat, since the oribi shows some tolerance to hunting. Nevertheless, the steep fall of 92% in oribi populations in Comoé National Park (Côte d'Ivoire) {{has been attributed to}} poaching. Numbers have also declined due to agricultural expansion and competition from livestock.|$|E
5|$|With Battle Mountain {{in their}} possession, the North Koreans {{set out to}} gain control of P'il-bong to the southeast. In the predawn hours of September 14 a force of 400 to 500 North Korean men {{attacked}} I and L Companies, 24th Infantry, on P'ilbong. Several attacks were repulsed, but because of men leaving their positions L Company's strength dwindled from 100 to 40 men. The remnant of L Company withdrew toward I Company's position on the crest of P'il-bong, only to find that this company under <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> attack had left the hill. They could not hold P'il-bong with the handful of men remaining and it was also lost.|$|E

5|$|Although Hamilton became {{concerned}} about his Mercedes' brakes, {{he was told that}} it was <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> sensor problem. He and Vergne reported that conditions had improved, but Vettel and Massa said that visibility remained poor. The safety car drove into the pit lane {{at the end of the}} ninth lap, and the cars were allowed to overtake. Button immediately made a pit stop to fit intermediate tyres. Hamilton attempted to pass Rosberg heading into the first corner, but could not overtake him. Rosberg began to pull away from him; Vettel tried to pass Magnussen going into the hairpin, but was unable to complete the manoeuvre. He ran wide at the Spoon Curve, remaining on the track by running onto the kerb. Pérez overtook Kvyat to claim ninth position on the lap. At the end of the first racing lap, Rosberg led Hamilton by 1.3 seconds; Hamilton was followed by Bottas, Massa, Ricciardo, Magnussen, Vettel, Räikkönen, Pérez and Kvyat.|$|E
5|$|Hammurabi was an Amorite First Dynasty {{king of the}} {{city-state}} of Babylon, and {{inherited the}} power from his father, Sin-Muballit, in c. 1792 BC. Babylon {{was one of the}} many largely Amorite ruled city-states that dotted the central and southern Mesopotamian plains and waged war on each other for control of fertile agricultural land. Though many cultures co-existed in Mesopotamia, Babylonian culture gained a degree of prominence among the literate classes throughout the Middle East under Hammurabi. The kings who came before Hammurabi had founded <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> City State in 1894 BC which controlled little territory outside of the city itself. Babylon was overshadowed by older, larger and more powerful kingdoms such as Elam, Assyria, Isin, Eshnunna and Larsa for a century or so after its founding. However his father Sin-Muballit had begun to consolidate rule of a small area of south central Mesopotamia under Babylonian hegemony and, by the time of his reign, had conquered the minor city-states of Borsippa, Kish, and Sippar.|$|E
5|$|Kuala Lumpur {{had seen}} a number of civil {{disturbances}} over the years. A riot in 1897 was <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> affair {{that began with the}} confiscation of faulty dacing (a scale used by traders), and in 1912, a more serious disturbance called the tauchang riot began during the Chinese New Year with the cutting of pigtails and ended with rioting and factional fighting lasting a number of days. The worst rioting on record in Malaysia however occurred on 13 May 1969, when race riots broke out in Kuala Lumpur. The so-called 13 May Incident refers to the violent conflicts that took place between members of the Malay and the Chinese communities. The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio-political status. The riots caused the deaths of 196 people according to official figures, and led to major changes in the country's economic policy to promote and prioritise Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities.|$|E
5|$|Sociology {{of leisure}} {{is a fairly}} recent {{subfield}} of sociology, compared to more traditional subfields such as sociology of work, sociology of the family, and sociology of education: it saw most of its development {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. Until then, leisure had often been seen as <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> unimportant, <b>minor</b> feature of society. Leisure is now recognized as a major social institution, deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly in Western societies.|$|R

5|$|In August 2011, Meir Abergil {{was freed}} and {{returned}} to Israel after having served about {{three years in prison}} first in Israel and then in the United States. Charged with blackmailing U.S. businessmen to whom the brothers had lent money, he allegedly had played <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> role in the crimes and is thought to have been involved mainly in the extortion of Asi Vaknin, who was arrested in Mexico and brought to the United States in April 2011, but refuses to testify against the Abergils. As a result, U.S. authorities reportedly were not able to build a case against Meir Abergil, leading to a plea agreement approved by a California court in which Abergil confessed to extortion of over a million dollars from another mob figure. In Israel, he faces criminal charges pending against him in the district court in Petah Tikva over allegations regarding his involvement in an Internet gambling business set up about 10 years ago which operated in many locations in Israel, including Internet cafes, convenience stores, soccer lottery outlets and nightclubs functioning as casinos. According to his lawyer, Abergil′s involvement in the alleged activities was marginal.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June 1513, Henry invaded France, and {{his troops}} {{defeated}} a French army at the Battle of the Spurs – <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> result, but one which was seized {{on by the}} English for propaganda purposes. Soon after, the English took Thérouanne and handed it over to Maximillian; Tournai, a more significant settlement, followed. Henry had led the army personally, complete with large entourage. His absence from the country, however, had prompted his brother-in-law, James IV of Scotland, to invade England {{at the behest of}} Louis. Nevertheless, the English army, overseen by Queen Catherine, decisively defeated the Scots at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513. Among the dead was the Scottish king, thus ending Scotland's brief involvement in the war. These campaigns had given Henry a taste of the military success he so desired. However, despite initial indications, he decided not to pursue a 1514 campaign. He had been supporting Ferdinand and Maximilian financially during the campaign but had received little in return; England's coffers were now empty. With the replacement of Julius by Pope Leo X, who was inclined to negotiate for peace with France, Henry signed his own treaty with Louis: his sister Mary would become Louis' wife, having previously been pledged to the younger Charles, and peace was secured for eight years, a remarkably long time.|$|E
5|$|On Huskisson's {{return to}} London Henry Dundas, the Home Secretary, {{appointed}} him {{to oversee the}} execution of the Aliens Act, which dealt with refugees arriving in Britain from areas affected by the French Revolution. He performed this task well, and in 1795 he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for War at the age of 24. In 1796 he was elected Member of Parliament(MP) for Morpeth. In 1799 he married Eliza Emily Milbanke (known as Emily), daughter of Admiral Mark Milbanke, and shortly afterwards moved to Eartham House near Chichester. He resigned from public office in 1801 following the fall of William Pitt the Younger's government. In 1804 he was re-elected to Parliament for Liskeard, and appointed to the post of Secretary to the Treasury by the returning Pitt. In 1809 Huskisson resigned from the government along with George Canning following Canning's duel with fellow cabinet minister Lord Castlereagh. In 1814 he re-entered public life as First Commissioner of Woods and Forests; although this was <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> post, he was very influential in the development of detailed legislation and policy, particularly regarding the controversial relaxation of the Corn Laws.|$|E
2500|$|A minor {{sabotage}} (aka little sabotage {{or small}} sabotage; [...] ) during World War II in Nazi-occupied Poland (1939–45) was any underground resistance operation that involved <b>a</b> disruptive but <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> and non-violent form of defiance, {{such as the}} painting of graffiti, the manufacture of fake documents, the disrupting of German propaganda campaigns, and the like.

5|$|The Commonwealth Navy {{was small}} and played <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> role {{in the history of}} the Commonwealth. Despite having access to the Baltic Sea, neither Poland nor Lithuania had any {{significant}} navy throughout their histories. In the 16th century, as Poland and Lithuania became involved in conflicts in Livonia, Polish king Sigismund II Augustus supported the operations of privateers, but that met with opposition of the Poland's primary port, Gdańsk (Danzig), which saw them as a threat to its trade operations. This led to the development of a privateer port in Puck. At the turn of the century, Poland became ruled by the House of Vasa, and was involved in a series of wars with Sweden (see also dominium maris baltici). Vasa kings attempted to create a proper fleet, and Władysław IV Vasa built a dedicated port for the royal navy (Władysławowo), but their attempts met with repeated failures, due to lack of funds in the royal treasury (seeing little need for the fleet, Polish nobility refused to raise taxes for its construction, and Gdańsk continued its opposition to the idea of a royal fleet). Although Władysław bought 12 ships, they were sold between 1641 and 1643, marking the end of the Commonwealth Navy.|$|E

This deterioration is a physical parallel to the emotional trauma being surfaced. There may be tears, writhing, or many other forms of physical disturbance.

50|$|The {{companies}} had predicted that {{development of the}} prototype would cost $2.48 million, and the government provided half of that under the PAIT agreements. The project overran the budget by $77,000, which the companies supplied out-of-pocket. The prototype coach was completed in 1971 and started testing with conventional locomotives. By the summer of 1972, it had seen 5000 mi of service, and <b>a</b> few <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> problems cropped up. Issues with the tilting mechanism were studied by a group at SPAR and McMaster University, and several fixes incorporated into the design. By that point the prototype locomotive was 85% complete.|$|R
