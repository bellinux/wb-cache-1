5|$|Concepts of women's {{social rights}} {{and social status}} during the Tang era were notably liberal-minded for the period. However, this was largely {{reserved}} for urban women of elite status, <b>as</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> in the rural countryside labored hard in their different set of tasks; with wives and daughters responsible for more domestic tasks of weaving textiles and rearing of silk worms, while men tended to farming in the fields. There were many women in the Tang era who gained access to religious authority by taking vows as Daoist priestesses. The head mistresses of the bordellos in the North Hamlet of the capital Chang'an acquired large amounts of wealth and power. Their high-class courtesans, who likely influenced the Japanese geishas, were well respected. These courtesans were known as great singers and poets, supervised banquets and feasts, knew the rules to all the drinking games, and were trained to have the utmost respectable table manners.|$|E

25|$|Optimal {{foraging}} theory (OFT) {{states that}} organisms forage {{in such a}} way as to maximize their energy intake per unit time. In other words, animals behave {{in such a way}} as to find, capture, and consume food containing the most calories while expending the least amount of time possible in doing so. The sexual division of labor provides an appropriate explanation as to why males forgo the opportunity to gather any items with caloric value- a strategy that would seem suboptimal from an energetic standpoint. The OFT suggests that the sexual division of labor is an adaptation that benefits the household; thus, foraging behavior of males will appear optimal at the level of the family. If a hunter-gatherer man does not rely on resources from others and passes up a food item with caloric value, it can be assumed that he is foraging at an optimal level. But, if he passes up the opportunity because it is a food that women routinely gather, then as long <b>as</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> share their spoils, it will be optimal for men to forgo the collection and continue searching for different resources to complement the resources gathered by women.|$|E

2500|$|Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints {{also believe}} that prior to their mortal birth, {{individuals}} existed <b>as</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> in a spiritual state. That period of life {{is referred to as}} the first estate or the Pre-existence. Latter-day Saints cite Biblical scriptures, such as Jeremiah 1:5, as an allusion to the concept that mankind had a preparation period prior to mortal birth: [...] "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations".|$|E

When {{originally}} serialised {{in a magazine}} it was subtitled, [...] "An Experiment in Prophecy", and is considered his most explicitly futuristic work. It offered the immediate political message of the privileged sections of society continuing to bar capable men from other classes from advancement until war would force a need to employ those most able, rather than the traditional upper classes, as leaders. Anticipating what {{the world would be}} like in the year 2000, the book is interesting both for its hits (trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of populations from cities to suburbs; moral restrictions declining <b>as</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> seek greater sexual freedom; the defeat of German militarism, and the existence of a European Union) and its misses (he did not expect successful aircraft before 1950, and averred that [...] "my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea").|$|E

The beginning of summer was marked by the star's setting with the Sun in the west and the disappearance of the larvae.

6000|$|The [...] "Volsunga Saga" [...] {{has this}} unique and unparalleled interest, {{that it gives}} the {{spectacle}} of the highest epic genius, struggling out of savagery into complete and free and conscious humanity. It is a mark of the savage intellect not to discriminate abruptly between man and the lower animals. In the tales of the lower peoples, the characters are just as often beasts <b>as</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> Now, in the earlier and wilder parts of the [...] "Volsunga Saga," [...] otters and dragons play human parts. Signy and his son, {{and the mother of}} their enemy, put on the skins of wolves, become wolves, and pass through hideous adventures. The story reeks with blood, and ravins with lust of blood.

60|$|We {{have this}} double {{interest}} in early American literature, {{that it is}} our own and unlike any other. The literatures of Europe began with wonder tales of a golden age, with stories of fairy ships, of kings akin to gods, of heroes who ventured into enchanted regions and there waged battle with dragons or the powers of darkness. American literature began with historical records, with letters of love and friendship, with diaries or journals of exploration, with elegiac poems lamenting the death of beloved leaders or hearth companions,--in a word, with the chronicles of human experience. In this respect, of recording {{the facts and the}} truth of life <b>as</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> fronted life bravely in the New World, our early literature differs radically from that of any other great nation: it brings us face to face not with myths or shadows but with our ancestors.|$|E
