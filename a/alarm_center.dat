In recent times, there has been a resurgence of interest in the question of whether and how language influences thought (Bowerman & Levinson, 2001; Gentner & Goldin-Meadow, 2003; Gumperz & Levinson, 1996). Some of this work is in the classic tradition of the strong version of the language-and-thought hypothesis, linguistic determinism: the thesis that the language a person speaks determines the way in which one perceives and encodes the world. This version is expressed in Whorf’s (1956) quote of Sapir: “[w]e see and hear and otherwise experience very largely as we do because the language habits of our community predispose certain choices of interpretation” (p. 134; Sapir, 1929, p. 210).

40|$|Only a {{few years}} ago, big worms roamed the planet, {{spreading}} within hours, or even minutes, to {{every nook and cranny}} of the Internet. The damage caused by them was equally impressive; worms have taken out <b>alarm</b> phone <b>centers,</b> train signalling systems, thousands of cash machines, millions of production PCs and servers, and, oh yes, South Korea 1. No wonder academics and industry scrambled to counter the threat. Indeed, fast spreading flash worms were all the rage among security experts and millions of euros were spent on projects to counter them. Alliances were formed, research grants applied for, projects started, prototype solutions developed, refined, and discarded. Unfortunately, by the time we developed practical counter measures, flash worms had all but disappeared. Instead, we now worry about stealth attacks, botnets, phishing sites, attacks on mobile phones, and whatever new threats emerged in recent years. The problem is that we tend to work on solutions for today’s problems and have no time to worry about the threats of the future. The problem is that we are often caught unawares. This need not be the case and there are examples of threats that we saw coming before they hit us. A well-known example is RFID. An RFID tag is a small, extremely low-cost chip {{that can be used for}} purposes like identification and minimal processing. By adding RFID tags to everything, from pets to products, industry aims to use RFID technology to create the “Internet of Things”. However, researchers have shown that tags can be used to propagate malware, which in turn has led a concerned industry to scrutinize security issues in RFID. All of this happened before any real attacks took place. For this reason the FORWARD initiative intends to bring together experts to discuss future threats and develop realistic threat scenarios. As a first step in that direction, a workshop was organized 1 The country virtually dropped off the map as a result of the Slammer worm [2]. in G¨oteborg, Sweden, in April 2008, to discuss future threats [1]. The workshop consisted of broad plenary sessions interspersed with focused experts meetings. This paper summarizes the workshop’s findings and their bearings on the future of trust.

40|$|AbstractAccidental {{freezing}} of vaccines is {{a growing}} threat and a real risk for national immunization programs when the potency of many vaccines can be compromised if these are exposed to sub-zero temperatures in the cold chain. In Tunisia, this issue is compounded by using sub-standard domestic cold chain equipment instead of equipping the program with medical refrigerators designed specifically for storing vaccines and temperature sensitive pharmaceuticals. Against this backdrop, this paper presents {{the findings of a}} demonstration project conducted in Tunisia in 2012 that tested the impact of introducing several freeze prevention solutions to mitigate the risk of accidental freezing of vaccines. The main finding is that, despite the continued use of underperforming domestic refrigerators, continuous temperature monitoring using new technologies combined with other technological interventions significantly reduced the prevalence of accidental exposure to freezing temperatures. These improvements were noticed for cold chain storage at regional, district and health center levels, and during the transport legs that were part of the demonstration conducted in the regions of Kasserine in the South-Eastern part of Tunisia. Subsequent to introducing these freeze prevention solutions, the incidence of freeze alarms was reduced and the percent of time the temperatures dropped below the 2 °C recommended threshold. The incidence of freeze <b>alarms</b> at health <b>center</b> level was reduced by 40 %. Lastly, the solutions implemented reduced risk of freezing during transport from 13. 8 % to 1. 7 %. Although the solution implemented is not optimal in the longer term because domestic refrigerators are used extensively in district stores and health centers, the risk of accidental freezing is significantly reduced by introducing the practice of continuous temperature monitoring as a standard. The management of the cold chain equipment was strengthened as a result which helps protect the potency of vaccines to the areas of most difficult access...|$|R

The systems which underwent the test were supplied bythree manufacturers: Bicron, Eberline and Exploranium. For the tests, a truck trailer loaded with iron scrap was equipped with guide tubes for the introduction of radioactive sources. During the whole experimental campaign, the truck trailer was not modified, to assure test reproducibility.

In Italysome accidents took place in the past; the major are here listed (Risica and Neccetelli, 2000) : • 1990 137 Cs contamination of an aluminium refineryin two facilities and the relevant waste dump; • 1991 137 Cs contamination of an unauthorized dump of wastes from aluminium melting; • 1991 241 Am contamination of some copper alloymanufacturer and melting firms; • 1993 137 Cs contamination of a part of the Brescia and Montirone goods yard; ∗ Corresponding author.

The most severe accident was that happened at Alfa Acciai steel mill, in which 7 GBq of 60 Co and 150 GBq of 137 Cs were molten in furnace. The consequences of the accident were rather limited. Indeed, part of the final product was contaminated byCo- 60, but the dust abatement plant had been effective in avoiding release of 137 Cs in the surrounding environment. Nevertheless, the total cost of the accident was more than 25 million Euros, including the decontamination of the plant and the missed profits. After this accident, the Lombardia Regional Council issued an Ordinance (Regione Lombardia, 1997) to impose different radiometric surveys on metal scrap to be recycled.

40|$|A {{prescriptive}} and performance-based {{fire and}} life safety evaluation for Christopher Cohan Center is performed. The results and {{findings of the}} evaluations are conveyed in this report. Christopher Cohan Center was built in accordance with California Building Code (1992 Edition) and California Fire Code (1992 Edition). The current version (2015) of International Building Code is consulted for prescriptive evaluation. The protection requirements set forth in IBC are intended to limit the threat from stage fires to an audience, to {{reduce the likelihood of}} a large fire in the stage area and to reduce the possibility of irrational mass response. These objectives have been identified as primary parameters to evaluate the fire and life safety systems of the building. Christopher Cohan Center was constructed of Type IB construction with a sprinkler system throughout the building. Legitimate stage is completely separated from seating by a proscenium wall of 2 -hour fire-rated construction with the main proscenium opening protected by an automatic closing fire protection curtain in accordance with IBC 410. 3. 5. A wet pipe, hydraulically calculated automatic sprinkler system is provided throughout the building. A hydraulic calculation was performed in accordance with NFPA 13, which shows that, the city water supply is not adequate for the sprinkler system and hose stream demands. The main exit of the Sydney Harman Hall accommodates a total occupant load of 1, 440, which is more than the total occupant load of the hall, 1, 289. This arrangement complies with IBC section 1029. 2. In addition to having access to a main exit, Christopher Cohan Center is provided with additional exits from the balcony level, gallery level, orchestra stage, and entry lobby. These exits provide an egress capacity of 5, 280 persons from orchestra stage and entry lobby levels and 960 persons from balcony and gallery levels, which are more than the total occupant loads served by an individual level. In the event of an <b>alarm,</b> Christopher Cohan <b>Center</b> Ushers are required to assist in the evacuation process. A fast-growing fire is modeled in FDS, which shows activation of gravity vents between 349 and 436 seconds, fire protection curtain activation at 440 s, and first sprinkler activation at 498 second after ignition. The tenability criterion is established to be the smoke layer descend within 2 m. above any means of egress. This criterion is predicted to occur at 210 s. in the zone model. FDS model does not predict smoke layer to descend within 2 m. above any means of egress, within the simulation time (570 s.). FDS model also shows that, the proscenium structure can contain the smoke until 300 s. FDS predicts the smoke detector will activate at 274 second. The notification of the fire event is expected to be triggered by the rapid descend of smoke layer, possibly shading or obscuring lighting effects dropped from the grid-iron, or by occupants, present in the fly gallery, sensing the presence of smoke, can initiate the notification of the fire event by activating manual fire alarm, long before the automatic detection devices detect the fire cues and initiate activation of the fire alarm. Based on the evaluation of the building and stage construction, the stage construction and fire separation play key-role in limiting the threat from a stage-fire to the audience due to its containment of smoke long enough for the audience to evacuate the hall. It can also be confirmed that the installed systems will not perform to meet the performance criteria. The building would be relying on human actions to detect fire, to annunciate, and to suppress the fire. To reduce the likelihood of a large fire in the stage area human intervention would be a crucial factor. Also, the collective effort of the egress system and human-assistance {{play a crucial role in}} evacuation process, which contributes to ensure minimal exposure to the fire environment. Due to effective evacuation and egress system, the possibility of irrational mass response is expected to be minimal. Recommendations include the incorporation of a fire pump based on the hydraulic demand for the most challenging design area. Proper inspection, testing and maintenance of the suppression systems is required, in accordance with specified standards. Additional requirements specified in the fire safety management plan must be included in the ‘Emergency Management Plan’ for Christopher Cohan Center. This includes engaging dedicated fire watch personnel and crowd managers during events, and incorporating specified employee training and response procedures along with all the emergency management procedures that are currently in place...|$|R
