5|$|Goya {{worked on}} The Disasters of War {{during a period}} when he was {{producing}} images more for his own satisfaction than for any contemporary audience. His work came to rely less on historical incidents than his own imagination. Many of the later plates contain fantastical motifs which {{can be seen as}} a return to the imagery of the Caprichos. In this, he is relying on visual clues derived from his inner life, rather than <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> recognised from real events or settings.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, metal {{detectors}} were installed {{as a permanent}} fixture to the entrance. The attraction officially had {{metal detectors}}, security with metal detecting wands, and a zero tolerance policy for cell phones, wallets, coins, watches, cameras, <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> placed in one's pockets; all pockets were to be absolutely empty prior to boarding. Persons in violation {{would be sent to}} the lockers or possibly ejected from the park without a refund.|$|E
5|$|The city faced {{attacks from}} Arab nomads from the Banu Hilal tribe. In 1057 the Zirids {{abandoned}} it for el-Mahdia, {{and it was}} never occupied again. Its building materials were later used by the inhabitants of Kairouan. As of 2009 {{the site of the}} city was a wasteland, crossed by many ditches, surrounded by the homes of poor people. <b>Anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> reused for construction or other purposes has been scavenged during the centuries since it was abandoned. Stones, bricks, glass and metal were all removed. Little survived except fragments of unusable stucco.|$|E

5000|$|Allmusic {{stated in}} its review: [...] "South Coast of Texas was a {{transition}} album toward the mature Clark style, {{one that was}} first to emerge on his next album, Better Days. It's not a landmark in his catalog, but neither <b>is</b> it <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> remotely <b>be</b> considered a failure." ...|$|R
50|$|While Zoroaster's Ormuzd {{created the}} {{universe}} with his thought, materialist Zurvanism challenged the concept <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{made out of}} nothing.|$|R
25|$|Cook's general {{approach}} was essentially empirical, encouraging as broad a diet as circumstances permitted, and collecting such greens {{as could be}} had when making landfall. All onboard ate the same food, with Cook specifically dividing equally <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> divided (and indeed recommending that practice to any commander – journal 4 August 1770).|$|E
25|$|Proponents of this {{position}} {{argue that the}} devastation from firebombing was greater than <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> justified by military necessity alone, and this establishes a prima facie case. The Allies {{were aware of the}} effects of firebombing, as British cities had been subject to them during the Blitz. Proponents disagree that Dresden had a military garrison and claim that most of the industry was in the outskirts and not in the targeted city centre, and that the cultural significance of the city should have precluded the Allies from bombing it.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Soviet Red Army forces {{launched}} Operation August Storm, which captured Manchuria {{from the}} Japanese. The Soviets looted the ruins of Shōwa Steel Works for <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> taken back to the Soviet Union. With the defeat of Japan in 1945, Anshan was returned to China {{along with the rest of}} Chinese Manchuria. However, peace had not yet arrived. Civil war continued between the Chinese Nationalist Government and the Communist People's Liberation Army (PLA). The city of Anshan was the scene of one of the battles of this war. The city was taken by the PLA on February 19, 1948. A monument in Lieshishan park commemorates the battle.|$|E

60|$|Clorinda {{stopped short}} suddenly. She had just remembered {{that she would}} not have liked to say that last {{sentence}} to Aunt Emmy. Therefore, there was something wrong about it. Clorinda had long ago learned that there was sure to be something wrong in <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> said to Aunt Emmy. So she stopped to think it over.|$|R

25|$|In 1947, Dayan was {{appointed}} to the Haganah General Staff working on Arab affairs, in particular recruiting agents to gain information about irregular Arab forces in Palestine. On 14 April 1948, his brother, Zorik, was killed in fighting. On 22 April, Dayan was put in charge of abandoned Arab property in newly conquered Haifa. To put a stop to the out-of-control looting, he ordered that <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used by the army be stored in Haganah warehouses and the rest be distributed amongst Jewish agricultural settlements. On 18 May, Dayan was given command of the Jordan Valley sector. In a nine-hour battle, his troops stopped the Syrian advance south of the Sea of Galilee.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} season the Dr. Weird {{openings}} were replaced with segments {{from the pilot}} episode of Spacecataz, an unaired spin-off created by Willis and Maiellaro. Six episodes were planned for production, but Adult Swim {{felt that there was}} little, if <b>anything,</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> made into five more episodes, since all of the characters were destroyed {{at the end of the}} pilot, despite the parent series being predominantly non-canon. These segments featured the Mooninites and Plutonians trading insults, gestures, and practical jokes. The full Spacecataz pilot is available as a special feature on the Volume Four DVD box-set. The Mooninites appear to outsmart the Plutonians for much of the series including tagging the Plutonians' ship and reversing a prank that involved 50 million large pizzas.|$|E

"America {{still has}} a {{constitutional}} protection of free speech, and I have been amazed... to see how few {{people in this country}} are willing to stick up for that elementary principle... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> taken as a slight." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1802 Romney {{was in the}} Red Sea, {{supporting}} General Baird's {{expedition to}} Egypt to help General Ralph Abercromby expel the French there. On 14 June the transport Calcutta wrecked on the Egyptian coast in the Red Sea. She was carrying 331 men of the 80th Regiment of Foot and 79 native Indian followers. [...] arrived the next day, as did two transports. Only Romney {{was able to get}} her boats out but they were able to rescue and deliver to the shore all but seven men who had died in an early attempt to reach shore. Popham left [...] to salvage <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> salvaged and then sailed to Suez from whence he dispatched Wilhelmina to pick up the troops on the 15th and carry them back to India.|$|E
500|$|PedroII {{played a}} decisive role by {{unequivocally}} backing the government's actions. He was a conscientious adherent of Catholicism, which he viewed as advancing important civilizing and civic values. While he avoided <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> considered unorthodox, he {{felt free to}} think and behave independently. The Emperor accepted new ideas, such as Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, of which he remarked that [...] "the laws that he [...] has discovered glorify the Creator". He was moderate in his religious beliefs, but could not accept disrespect to civil law and government authority. As he told his son-in-law: [...] " [...] has {{to ensure that the}} constitution is obeyed. In these proceedings there is no desire to protect masonry; but rather the goal of upholding the rights of the civilian power." [...] The crisis was resolved in September 1875 after the Emperor grudgingly agreed to grant full amnesty to the bishops and the Holy See annulled the interdicts.|$|E
500|$|The scene {{dated to}} Kankō 5, 10th month, 17th day (November 17, 1008), shows two drunk courtiers {{trying to gain}} {{entrance}} to Murasaki Shikibu quarters after she had enjoyed the garden outside her apartment. In the illustration, Murasaki holds her window shut against the men. First {{to arrive at the}} scene is the palace steward Sangi [...] (on right) who opens the upper part of Murasaki's lattice door and inquires whether anybody is at home. According to Murasaki Shikibu his intention is to be mentioned to Akiko. Sanenari is joined by the consort's steward (associated with Akiko), Sangi [...] who also calls out: [...] "Is anyone here?" [...] Murasaki replies faintly, avoiding <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> regarded as flirting. Together the two courtiers are requesting her to open {{the lower part of the}} door. Such behaviour, somebody of higher rank trying to enter the house of somebody of lower rank, was in the Heian period considered disgraceful and only excused by the young age of the two courtiers.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} project {{of its kind in}} China to be {{designed}} as an entire system in which the Osprey class submersible is part of the bigger system that included the mother ship, shore facilities such as pier equipment and storage facilities. As a result, <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> salvaged by the submersible itself (with negative buoyancy of 1.2 ton or greater) <b>could</b> <b>be</b> easily salvaged by the mother ship {{with the help of the}} submersible.|$|R
5000|$|When {{they meet}} the Reverend, {{they find that}} he is amazed that the Goodies want {{to eat and drink}} tea etc. He tells them that eating, {{drinking}} tea, and other such activities are sinful. The Reverend is with the Church of the Seventh Day Repressionists, and the church has disallowed <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> even <b>be</b> remotely construed as fun: [...] "You'll catch none of us committing one... of the Nine Thousand, Seven Hundred, and Sixty-Four Deadly Sins!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, {{the office}} of the Manitoba {{ombudsman}} received a complaint alleging that Mondesir had sold and disclosed patient information to Lenscrafters International Inc. As a result of the complaint, Mondesir became the first medical professional in Manitoba to be charged under the provisions of the province's Personal Health Information Act. His attorney, former cabinet minister Sidney Green, said that Mondesir had done nothing wrong and had not disclosed any health information or <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> found in a telephone book.|$|R
500|$|Flight Unlimited {{was placed}} in direct {{competition}} with several major flight simulator franchises. Before the game's release, Shelby Bateman of Next Generation Magazine wrote, [...] "1995 {{is going to be}} a real dogfight in the flight-sim and aerial-combat categories, and LookingGlass [...] is betting its bankroll ... that it can capture significant market share from the likes of Microsoft Flight Simulator and the debut of Spectrum HoloByte's Falcon 4.0, among others." [...] Describing the situation, Johnny L. Wilson of Computer Gaming World wrote, [...] "The games that sell big are the ones that allow you to blow stuff up, so, if <b>anything,</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a problem for Flight Unlimited." [...] Doug Church explained that, because the game did not feature combat and bore little resemblance to Microsoft Flight Simulator, the team spent [...] "many late nights" [...] on marketing strategies. However, he noted that the game had a wide appeal among those who tested it during development, which he called [...] "a really good sign". Talking to Bernie Yee of PC Gamer US, Paul Neurath said that he thought the game would sell well. Yee noted that Neurath [...] "fully [...] it to prove more popular than Microsoft Flight Simulator".|$|E
2500|$|Although Caesar {{was always}} nervous of failure, {{he appears to}} have been highly {{regarded}} by other players. He often opened the innings. Richard Daft, a fellow All-Englander, wrote that [...] "his hitting was as smart and clean as <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> witnessed".|$|E
2500|$|Before 1830, few Americans used ice to {{refrigerate}} foods {{due to a}} lack of ice-storehouses and iceboxes. As these two things became more widely available, individuals used axes and saws to harvest ice for their storehouses. [...] This method proved to be difficult, dangerous, and certainly did not resemble <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> duplicated on a commercial scale.|$|E
50|$|In the 3rd century, Tertullian {{emphasized}} {{the perfection of}} Christ as a key consequence of the Incarnation of the Logos in Christ. In Tertullian's view to suggest <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> added to improve Christ would be to deny the Gospels.|$|R
60|$|Miss Ophelia {{noticed it}} too, {{and tried to}} make Mr. St. Clare see it. But he would not. He loved his little Eva so much, {{that he did not want}} to believe <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> the matter with her.|$|R
5|$|Motohiro {{wanted to}} return to making anime after a long hiatus but he needed a charismatic script writer. Motohiro and his staff were {{surprised}} with Gen Urobuchi's contribution to the highly acclaimed anime series, Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Motohiro was fascinated by Madoka Magica; he read other works from Urobuchi, which persuaded him to talk to Urobuchi. In early 2011, Motohiro proposed to Urobuchi that the pair should work together. Early {{in the making of}} the series, Motohiro told Naoyoshi Shiotani not to make <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> adapted into a live-action film.|$|R
2500|$|In 1953, two land {{reclamation}} projects added [...] to Hong Kong. The first project would specifically add runway {{space to the}} Kai Tak Airport. Additional land would turn Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan into industrial towns. The early industrial centres churned out <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> produced in a small space, like buttons, artificial flowers, umbrellas, textiles, enamelware, footwear and plastics.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{his earlier}} works not {{surprisingly}} displayed {{some of the}} influence of his mentor, Lautner gradually developed his own style and consciously avoided <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> classified as [...] "Wright-influenced". An exception among his later commissions to this was the Wolff House in West Hollywood (1963) which was often cited by his critics as a [...] "Wrightian" [...] building, much to his chagrin, but as he explained in 1986: ...|$|E
2500|$|The role of {{information}} processing in consciousness has been criticised by John Searle who, in his Chinese room argument, {{states that he}} cannot find <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> recognised as conscious experience {{in a system that}} relies solely on motions of things from place to place. Dennett sees this argument as misleading, arguing that consciousness is not to be found in a specific part of the system, but in the actions of the whole. In essence, he denies that consciousness requires something in addition to capacity for behaviour, saying that philosophers such as Searle, [...] "just can't imagine how understanding could be a property that emerges from lots of distributed quasi-understanding in a large system" [...] (p.439).|$|E
