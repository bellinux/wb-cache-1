40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to assess the}} {{relationship}} between motion activity of dairy cattle as measured using <b>activity</b> <b>meters</b> and reproduction, production and health parameters. For a one-year period the motion activity of 210 dairy cows was monitored. The results show that {{at the start of the}} rutting period there is a noticeable increase in motion activity (mainly during nighttime hours), specifying the exact start of rutting and the subsequent insemination. If the rutting period is detected accurately the percentage of dairy cows that are impregnated increases. Using <b>activity</b> <b>meters</b> improves reproduction indicators. Motion activity in sick cattle is generally reduced and after a warning the animals can be treated in time. The relationship between motion activity and production parameters is statistically inconclusive...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} measures of congestion control on freeways has been ramp metering, where vehicle entry to the freeway is regulated by traffic signals (meters). Meters are run with calibrated influx rates to prevent highway saturation. However, recent observations of some metering sites in San Diego, CA indicate that metering, during peak hour demand, is helping freeway flow while sometimes creating considerable traffic back-ups on local streets, transferring congestion problems from the freeway to intersections. Metering problems stem largely from the difficulty of designing an integrated, dynamic metering scheme that responds not only to changing freeway conditions but also to fluctuating demand throughout the ramp network; a scheme whose objective is to maintain adequate freeway throughput as well as minimize disproportionate ramp delays and queue overspills onto surface streets. Simulation modeling is a versatile, convenient, relatively inexpensive and safe systems analysis tool for evaluating alternative strategies to achieve the above objective. The objective of this research was to establish a basic building block for a discrete system simulation model, ONRAMP, based on a stochastic, mesoscopic, queueing approach. ONRAMP is for modeling entrance ramp geometry, vehicular generation, platooning and arrivals, queueing <b>activities,</b> <b>meters</b> and metering rates. The architecture of ONRAMP 2 ̆ 7 s molecular unit is designed in a fashion so that it can be, with some model calibration, duplicated for a number of ramps and, if necessary, integrated into some other larger freeway network models. SLAM. II simulation language is used for computer implementation. ONRAMP has been developed and partly validated using data from eight ramps at Interstate-B in San Diego. From a systems perspective, simulation will be short-sided and problem analysis is incomplete unless the other non-technical metering problems are explored and considered. These problems include the impacts of signalizing entrance ramps on the vitality of adjacent intersections, land use and development, 2 ̆ 2 fair 2 ̆ 2 geographic distribution of meters and metering rates throughout the freeway corridor, public acceptance and enforcement, and the role and influence of organizations in charge of decision making in this regard. Therefore, an outline of a contextual systems approach for problem analysis is suggested. Benefits and problems of freeway control via ramp metering, both operational short-term and strategic long-term, are discussed in two dimensions: global (freeway) and local (intersection). The results of a pilot study which includes interviews with field experts and law enforcement officials and a small motorist survey are presented...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{benefits}} of information technologies were assessed at farm level {{by means of}} a dynamic probabilistic simulation model. The model included biological performances with respect to oestrus detection and concentrate feeding. In this way, main {{benefits of}} <b>activity</b> <b>meters,</b> automated concentrate feeders and on-line automated parlour systems for recording of milk production and milk temperature could be estimated. In comparison with the default situation, improvement in oestrus detection from 50 % to 90 % increased gross margin by Dfl. 1. 28 per 100 kg fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) per year under Dutch production conditions. This equals 8. 0 % of a farmer's typical net return to labour and management. Using an individual feeding system increased gross margin by Dfl. 0. 77 per 100 kg FPCM per year and the net return to labour and management by 4. 8 %. Feeders increased the frequency of concentrate provision from two to four times a day. Moreover, a more accurate performance-related concentrate provision was achieved from total daily amount in portions of 1 - 0. 1 kg. In addition feeders enabled the possibility of overcoming the limited concentrate intake for high-producing animals in the milking parlour {{in the beginning of the}} lactation. A more accurate milk production estimation increased gross margin and the net return to labour and management by Dfl. 0. 17 per 100 kg FPCM and 1. 1 % respectively. In the latter case equilibrium feeding was compared with a feeding method in which concentrate supply was based on an standard deviation of 5 % in the estimated energy requirements for milk production. The results of this study will be used to evaluate theoretically the economic viability of the investigated IT applications...|$|R

50|$|Gameplay is {{depended}} in {{both the}} Nintendo DS's touchscreen or using the directional buttons and both the A and B buttons. However, some of the game's minigames can only be played with the touchscreen or the microphone feature. The game takes control on the Zooble the player chose in the region selection screen and controls its actions using the touch screen or the directional keypads. Also like other pet simulation games, the player must watch over the Zooble's hunger, playfulness and cleanness. For its hunger, the player must feed it with either fruits which {{can be obtained from}} trees or vegetables that the player grows in its garden. For its activeness, the Player must make the Zooble participate in some Minigames to increase its <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> and for its cleanness, the player Zooble must take a bath once a day.

Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has comparable accuracy with a brute-force algorithm but requires less computing time.
