The two players agreed to play a match if Rubinstein could raise the funds, but Rubinstein had few rich friends to back him and the match was never played. This situation demonstrated some of the flaws inherent in the championship system then being used. The start of World War I in summer 1914 put an end to hopes that Lasker would play either Rubinstein or Capablanca for the World Championship in the near future.|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} the cancellation, McCouch {{felt it was}} [...] "doomed to fail" [...] {{from the beginning and}} referred to UPN as [...] "a loser network at that time" [...] due its treatment of the series. Cosgrove disagreed with McCouch's sentiment and believed that the show's lack of success was not tied to the network specifically. Rodriquez believed that All Souls was unsuccessful as it was [...] "just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> its time"; he felt that the program was better suited for television one to two years following its initial broadcast. The series has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or licensed to on an online-streaming service.|$|E
500|$|In his {{tribute to}} the writer, Bernard Hayes said [...] "Tunis has {{probably}} made good readers of millions of young people." [...] His success with the juvenile audience helped change the publishing industry. Along with writers like Howard Pease, his books demonstrated to publishers that there was {{money to be made}} in targeting books for teenagers. His influence went beyond simply creating a market for young adult books. [...] "In his attempt to link sports with the communities in which they are played, he broached some highly significant issues in the literature written for and about America's youth", according to John S. Simmons in John R. Tunis and the Sports Novels for Adolescents: <b>A</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Ahead</b> <b>of</b> His Time. Tunis never considered himself a writer of boys' books, insisting his stories could be read and enjoyed by adults. He felt that the word [...] "juvenile" [...] was an [...] "odious... product of a merchandising age". Despite his dislike of the term, Tunis' novels helped create and shape the juvenile fiction book market.|$|E

2500|$|For a reflex-cambered airfoil, {{the center}} of {{pressure}} lies <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the quarter-chord point at maximum lift coefficient (large angle of attack), but as lift coefficient reduces (angle of attack reduces) {{the center of}} pressure moves forward. [...] When the lift coefficient is zero an airfoil is generating no lift but a reflex-cambered airfoil generates a nose-up pitching moment, so {{the location of the}} center of pressure is an infinite distance ahead of the airfoil. [...] This direction of movement of the center of pressure on a reflex-cambered airfoil has a stabilising effect.|$|E
2500|$|Abraham Lincoln {{passed through}} Syracuse twice.

His train arrived in the city that afternoon <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> schedule. Its arrival was announced by a [...] "booming cannon" [...] of the Washington Artillery, fired at Regiment Park, while the Regimental Band played The Star Spangled Banner. The train was composed of a gaily decorated engine, baggage car and two coaches which were filled with the Presidential entourage and various committees representing cities along the Central Road.|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, Kelly {{was working}} on 14 songs for Under the Sun, which were {{recorded}} as demos. Kelly's wife Kaarin Fairfax was recording scenes {{for her role in}} the movie Young Einstein (1988). Her fellow actress Lulu Pinkus was married to the film's director, Yahoo Serious, who was looking for material for its soundtrack. A tape copy of the demo tracks was handed to Serious with Kelly's instructions [...] "See if there's anything that fits. They're just roughs. We're going back into the studio next month to record them properly". Kelly expected to work further on the tracks: [...] "I'd made notes to adjust a few of them. 'Dumb Things', for one, was too fast. I'd wanted it to have more of a grind but it sounded <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> itself". When Serious used the demo version for a scene in Young Einstein Kelly was unable to change its tempo while recording the studio version. The group were [...] "playing along to our demo pumping through the speakers... We even mimicked ... the way the original track sped up and slowed down".|$|E

At the time, people couldn't relate to it, and the studio Universal didn't believe in it. Rutger Hauer's performance held it together â€” he was an excellent villain.|$|R

Save for it, I might have feared that I had lost my way, for as yet I had passed no sign of human habitation. But that light was sufficient. Gomez had told me of it. It was the light which burned always, from dusk to morning, from the tower of the monastery of St. Bernard.|$|R
2500|$|In 1655 Dutch diplomat William de Boreel {{tried to}} solve the mystery of who invented the telescope. He had a local {{magistrate}} in Middelburg follow up on Boreel's childhood and early adult recollections of a spectacle maker named [...] "Hans" [...] who he remembered as the inventor of the telescope. The magistrate was contacted by a then unknown claimant, Middelburg spectacle maker Johannes Zachariassen, who testified that his father, Zacharias Janssen invented the telescope and the microscope as early as 1590. This testimony seemed convincing to Boreel, who now recollected that Zacharias and his father, Hans Martens, must have been who he remembered. Boreel's conclusion that Zacharias Janssen invented the telescope <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> another spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey, was adopted by Pierre Borel in his 1656 book De vero telescopii inventore. Discrepancies in Boreel's investigation and Zachariassen's testimony (including Zachariassen misrepresenting his date of birth and role in the invention) has led some historians to consider this claim dubious. The [...] "Janssen" [...] claim would continue over the years and be added on to with Zacharias Snijder in 1841 presenting 4 iron tubes with lenses in them claimed to be 1590 examples of Janssen's telescope and historian Cornelius De Waard's 1906 claim that the man who tried to sell a broken telescope to astronomer Simon Marius at the 1608 Frankfurt Book Fair must have been Janssen.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2007, Haggard {{released}} a statement asking for monetary donations to help support his family while {{he and his wife}} attend classes at the University of Phoenix. Haggard said that he was pursuing a degree in counseling while his wife Gayle was studying psychology. He also announced that his family was moving into the Dream Center, a Phoenix-based halfway house that ministers to recovering convicts, drug addicts, and prostitutes. After Haggard's request for donations, a member of Haggard's restoration team said he should have consulted with them before releasing a statement. News media pointed out several questions concerning the need for his fundraising, citing his previous six-figure salary, his $138,000 severance package, an $85,000 anniversary bonus that was paid shortly before the scandal broke, the Haggards' Colorado Springs home that was valued at more than $600,000, and royalties from Haggard's many books. Questions also surfaced about the tax-exempt group [...] "Families With a Mission". Haggard asked that donations be sent to on his behalf. According to Haggard, the group would use 10% of donations for administrative costs and forward 90% to Haggard. But the group was dissolved in February 2007, according to the Colorado Secretary of State. A few days after Haggard's initial email statement, his restoration team stepped in to say his statement was [...] "inappropriate" [...] and that [...] "Haggard was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> himself." [...] They indicated that Haggard would not be working at the Dream Center or in ministry of any kind and that they advised Haggard to seek secular employment to support himself and his family.|$|E
