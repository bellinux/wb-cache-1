Over the past decades, nanotechnology and fluorescence imaging techniques {{have become increasingly}} attractive for early detection of cancer. The high sensitivity required for differentiating abnormal cells from normal cells presents a challenge to existing diagnostic protocols. Among other types of nanomaterials, lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have unique optical properties and thus hold a great promise in cancer detection {{at a very early}} stage using fluorescence imaging. Large Stokes and <b>anti-Stokes</b> shifts, long <b>luminescence</b> lifetime and excellent photostability make UCNPs a good choice for biological and biomedical applications. On the other hand, biological detection based on UCNP-probes is seriously limited by aggregation of the UCNPs when interacting with biomolecules and by non-specific binding in cell-based detection assays. This thesis explores a series of novel UCNP bioconjugation strategies to overcome the current barriers in bioapplications of UCNPs by enhancing their water dispersibility and stability and decreasing the non-specific binding of UCNP-biomolecule conjugates. In this research, NaYF₄: Yb³⁺/Er³⁺ and NaYF₄: Yb³⁺/Tm³⁺ UCNPs were synthesized and a NaYF₄: Yb³⁺/Er³⁺@NaGdF₄ core-shell structure was used to improve the upconversion luminescence intensity (Chapter 2). Various surface modification methods including ligand attraction, ligand oxidation, ligand exchange and silica coating were tested and compared to identify a suitable approach for the subsequent bioconjugation study (Chapter 3). Two novel bioconjugation strategies will be presented in detail. Chapter 4 illustrates conjugation of UCNPs to the MIL- 38 antibodies through a biotin-streptavidin bridge. Chapter 5 demonstrates a modified one step bioconjugation strategy between UCNPs and MIL- 38 antibodies by using a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) linker and orientation controlled functionalization of antibodies. Both novel UCNP-biomolecule conjugation strategies produce water-stable and dispersible products and the biomolecules tested retained their biological activity during the conjugation process. In addition, a fabricated UCNP-antibody complex specifically targeting DU 145 prostate cancer cells without detectable non-specific binding was achieved.

Modern methods of detection based on radiological computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can identify a tumor after its volume has become big enough, i. e. it contains more than 10  billion cells. Therefore, an improvement of sensitivity and resolution ability of diagnostic tools to identify early stages of malignant neoplasms seems of utmost importance. Aim: To demonstrate the potential of a new class of <b>anti-Stokes</b> <b>luminescence</b> nanoparticles for deep optical imaging with high contrast of malignant tumors. Materials and methods: Upconversion nanoparticles with narrow dispersion and a  size of 70 to 80   nm, with a  core/shell structure of NaYF 4 :Yb 3 +:Tm 3 +/NaYF 4 were used in the study. The nanoparticles have an intensive band of anti-Stokes photoluminescence at a wavelength of 800   nm under irradiation with a  wavelength of 975   nm (both wavelengths are within the transparency window for biological tissues). The conversion coefficient of the excitation radiation into the <b>anti-Stokes</b> <b>luminescence</b> was 9 %. To increase the time during which nanoparticles can circulate in blood flow of small animals, the nanoparticles were covered by a  biocompatible amphiphilic polymer shell. As a  tumor model we used Lewis epidermoid carcinoma transfected to mice. Results: We were able to obtain stable water colloids of nanoparticles covered with amphiphilic polymer that could preserve their initial size at least for one month. The use of upconversion nanoparticles with a  hydrophilic shell made of intermittent maleic anhydride and octadecene co-polymer with subsequent coating with diglycidyl polyethylene glycol ether allowed for reduction of non-specific reaction of nanoparticles with plasma proteins. In its turn, it resulted in an increased time of their circulation in blood flow of small animals for up to 1  hour. With the Lewis lung carcinoma transfected to mice model we demonstrated аn in-life transportation of upconversion nanoparticles into the tumor with a  high degree of localization due to a passive EPR effect. The contrast of luminescent signal in the tumor compared to adjacent tissues was at least 70 %. The possibility of visualization of upconverted nanoparticles up to 15  mm of biological tissue was shown.

The obtained three-dimensional spectra have been presented for different host glass compositions: silicate, germanate, aluminosilicate and phosphosilicate. Energy-level configuration and main radiative transitions associated with BACs in GeO 2 and SiO 2 glasses have been revealed. Fluorescence lifetime analysis of the basic radiative transitions of BAC have been carried out.

Besides {{the characterization of}} these materials, we report on peculiar properties observed in the anti-Stokes Raman branch of the Raman spectra. They consist in an abnormal anti-Stokes Raman emission which is explained by a mechanism reminiscent of a Coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) emission. It results from a wave mixing process between the incident laser light and Stokes Raman light, generated by the SERS mechanism. In a parallel way, we have investigated in details the resonance effects which also induce anomalies in the anti-Stokes/Stokes intensity ratios, {{as a function of}} several parameters including the observation temperature, the environmental conditions, the dilution in solvents, etc. Studies extended to composites based on carbon nanotubes and conjugated polymers reveal also interesting properties. In the case of poly(bithiophene) (PBTh), one observes a strong amplification of the 1450 cm− 1 Raman line in the anti-Stokes branch, generated by the plasmon excitation of metallic tubes.

30|$|Research on {{upconversion}} nanocrystals increased exponentially {{over the}} past several years (e.g., in 2000, one article on upconversion nanomaterials was published, in 2009, it have been 57) as the extremely attractive prospects for applications of these materials in bioanalytics [3], (cancer) therapy [4], and electro-optics [5]. And subsequently, it is concluded that the most efficient infrared-to-visible upconversion phosphors are Yb/Er or Yb/Tm co-doped fluorides, such as hexagonal phase NaYF 4 [6, 7], LaF 3 [8, 9], and orthorhombic phase YF 3 [10], GdF 3 [11]. Especially in the past few years, the NaYF 4 -based phosphors, as the highest efficient upconversion phosphors, with different morphologies and different dopants have been widely investigated, based on various synthesis procedures. However, GdF 3 as one of the efficient upconversion phosphor host [8], not too much work has been reported focusing on Yb/Er codoped fluorecence upconversion. Although Tm, Dy, Ho, and Yb/Tm doped GdF 3 has been reported [11 – 14]. As far as we know, in 1971, the preparation of GdF 3 :Yb, Er phosphor was reported firstly by Major et al. In their procedure, the oxide precursors were dissolved in high purity nitric acid and precipitated with excess hydrofluoric acid, and finally experienced calcination. They found that the color of the <b>anti-Stokes</b> <b>luminescence</b> of the Yb/Er doped GdF 3 phosphors was controllable by preparation processes, and was associated with the crystal structure of the host lattices. And they gave a dominant green emission when excited by 940 nm infrared light [10]. In 2006, Fan et al. employed a hydrothermal synthesis procedure to produced Yb/Er codoped GdF 3 nanoparticles. For their prepared sample, typical upconversion emission was observed but with much weaker intensity than that of bulk crystal [15].|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, upconverting {{nanoparticles}} (UCNPs) doped with rare earth ions {{have become an}} important class of fluorescence contrast agents for molecular imaging, due to their unique properties. Their property of <b>anti-Stokes</b> <b>luminescence,</b> with both the excitation and emission wavelengths close to the optimal for biomedical imaging, has been extensively explored in various biomedical applications. The work described in this thesis is mainly concerned with the investigation of other unique properties of UCNPs, including nonlinearity and saturation, to improve fluorescence diffuse imaging and tomography. The aim of this work was also to develop a suitable method of characterizing the power-density-dependent quantum yield of UCNPs, and to optimize the excitation scheme {{in order to facilitate}} their use in deep tissues. Upconversion emission has a nonlinear dependence on the excitation intensity. This nonlinearity was exploited to improve the image reconstruction quality in fluorescence diffuse optical tomography, by increasing the orthogonal information density through simultaneous multibeam excitation. It is also demonstrated that the use of nonlinear UCNPs as contrast agents in fluorescence tomography can breach the current limit on spatial resolution encountered when using linear fluorophores. UCNPs can emit multiple emission bands with large differences in tissue attenuation under excitation of near-infrared light. Such multispectral information was used to create a regularization map to guide fluorescence diffuse optical tomography, which yielded significantly better axial resolution in the reconstructed images than using standard Tikhonov regularization. The quantum yield of upconversion emission increases with excitation intensity and gradually reaches a plateau. In this work, an initial model was developed to describe the quantum yield of two-photon upconversion emission {{as a function of the}} excitation intensity, based on rate equation analysis. A balancing power density was identified, which characterizes the excitation-intensity dependence of the quantum yield. At such a power density, the quantum yield reaches half the maximum attainable value, occurring at very high excitation intensities when UCNPs are saturated. Pulsed excitation is proposed as a superior mode of excitation to continuous wave excitation, due to the potential of achieving higher intrinsic quantum yields from UNCPs without increasing the average excitation power. This will fundamentally increase the applicability of UCNPs in deep tissues...|$|E
40|$|The {{materials}} {{commonly used}} and the synthetic problems that arise {{in the field of}} transparent glass materials with anti-Stokes luminescent properties are described. The literature has shown that rare earth doped oxide glasses, whilst chemically durable and relatively easy to manufacture, have weak anti-Stokes emissions, whereas rare earth doped fluoride materials have considerably improved <b>anti-Stokes</b> <b>luminescence</b> but are less chemically stable and highly reactive. Recent interest in glass ceramics has proposed alternative matrices with the advantages of both fluoride and oxide host materials. These materials consist of rare earth doped fluoride crystallites in an oxide glass matrix giving the emission characteristics of a fluoride crystal protected in the stable surroundings of an oxide matrix. The work in this thesis initially set out to build on these lattices but broadened {{in the light of the}} findings outlined below. The synthesis of silica based glasses using sol-gel techniques is covered thoroughly in this work and the incorporation of various cations into these matrices has been investigated. Amongst the cations added to silica sol-gel reactions are titania, alumina and yttrium. Their reactions and the factors that promote transparent and crystallite-free samples have been reported and discussed. Several advances in this field have been made including a detailed investigation into the synthesis and properties of yttrium based sol-gel reactions which have not been previously reported. The incorporation of fluorine into these materials has also been described and the various problems encountered have been examined. Several novel methods of incorporating fluoride ions into silica lattices are proposed and examined. It was found that in the presence of fluoride ions, the rare earth dopants form crystallites within the glass matrix. In a similar way, it was found that glass ceramics also formed when a titanium alkoxide is incorporated with fluoride ions during the sol-gel synthesis of these lattices. In these cases it was shown that TiO 2 in the form of anatase or rutile crystallites can be grown in the glass matrix. Moreover the phase of TiCb grown can be easily controlled by choice of annealing temperature and firing times. Distinct anti-Stokes emissions are produced depending upon the form of titania present.

40|$|Lanthanides {{represent}} the chemical elements from lanthanum to lutetium. They intrinsically exhibit some very exciting photophysical properties, {{which can be}} further enhanced by incorporating the lanthanide ion into organic or inorganic sensitizing structures. A very popular approach is to conjugate the lanthanide ion to an organic chromophore structure forming lanthanide chelates. Another approach, which has quickly gained interest, is to incorporate the lanthanide ions into nanoparticle structures, thus attaining improved specific activity and binding capacity. The lanthanide-based reporters usually express strong luminescence emission, multiple narrow emission lines covering a wide wavelength range, and exceptionally long excited state lifetimes enabling timeresolved detection. Because of these properties, the lanthanide-based reporters have found widespread applications in various fields of life. This study focuses {{on the field of}} bioanalytical applications. The aim {{of the study was to}} demonstrate the utility of different lanthanide-based reporters in homogeneous Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) -based bioaffinity assays. Several different model assays were constructed. One was a competitive bioaffinity assay that utilized energy transfer from lanthanide chelate donors to fluorescent protein acceptors. In addition to the conventional FRET phenomenon, a recently discovered non-overlapping FRET (nFRET) phenomenon was demonstrated for the first time for fluorescent proteins. The lack of spectral overlap in the nFRET mechanism provides sensitivity and versatility to energy transfer-based assays. The distance and temperature dependence of these phenomena were further studied in a DNA-hybridization assay. The distance dependence of nFRET deviated from that of FRET, and unlike FRET, nFRET demonstrated clear temperature dependence. Based on these results, a possible excitation mechanism operating in nFRET was proposed. In the study, two enzyme activity assays for caspase- 3 were also constructed. One of these was a fluorescence quenching-based enzyme activity assay that utilized novel inorganic particulate reporters called upconverting phosphors (UCPs) as donors. The use of UCPs enabled the construction of a simple, rather inexpensive, and easily automated assay format that had a high throughput rate. The other enzyme activity assay took advantage of another novel reporter class, the lanthanidebinding peptides (LBPs). In this assay, energy was transferred from a LBP to a green fluorescent protein (GFP). Using the LBPs it was possible to avoid the rather laborious, often poorly repeatable, and randomly positioned chemical labeling. In most of the constructed assays, time-resolved detection was used to eliminate the interfering background signal caused by autofluorescence. The improved signal-to-background ratios resulted in increased assay sensitivity, often unobtainable in homogeneous assay formats using conventional organic fluorophores. The <b>anti-Stokes</b> <b>luminescence</b> of the UCPs, however, enabled the elimination of autofluorescence even without time-gating, thus simplifying the instrument setup. Together, the studied reporters and assay formats pave the way for increasingly sensitive, simple, and easily automated bioanalytical applications...|$|E
