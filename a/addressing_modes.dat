25|$|The ARM {{processor}} {{also has}} features rarely seen in other RISC architectures, such as PC-relative addressing (indeed, on the 32-bit ARM the PC {{is one of}} its 16nbsp&registers) and pre- and post-increment <b>addressing</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Four-input address-adders {{enables the}} Pentium to further reduce the address {{calculation}} latency {{compared to the}} 80486. The Pentium can calculate full <b>addressing</b> <b>modes</b> with segment-base + base-register + scaled register + immediate offset in a single cycle; the 486 has a three-input address-adder only, and must therefore divide such calculations between two cycles.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Address</b> <b>mode</b> {{operations}} - Use <b>address</b> <b>modes</b> {{to simplify}} code.|$|R
50|$|This <b>addressing</b> <b>mode</b> {{is closely}} related to the indexed {{absolute}} <b>addressing</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|R
50|$|A Change <b>Address</b> <b>Mode</b> (CAM) {{instruction}} switched between 2-, 3- and 4-character <b>address</b> modes.The <b>address</b> <b>mode</b> specified {{the number}} of characters needed for each operand address in instructions.|$|R
25|$|The {{designers}} {{attempted to}} make the assembly language orthogonal. That is, instructions are divided into operations and address modes, and almost all address modes are available for almost all instructions. There are 56 instructions and a minimum instruction size of 16 bits. Many instructions and <b>addressing</b> <b>modes</b> are longer to include additional address or mode bits.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1970s, {{researchers}} (particularly John Cocke) at IBM (and similar projects elsewhere) {{demonstrated that}} the majority of combinations of these orthogonal <b>addressing</b> <b>modes</b> and instructions were not used by most programs generated by compilers available at the time. It proved difficult in many cases to write a compiler with more than limited ability {{to take advantage of the}} features provided by conventional CPUs.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{significant}} enhancements {{introduced in the}} 6809 were the use of two 8-bit accumulators (A and B, which could be combined into a single 16-bit register, D), two 16-bit index registers (X, Y) and two 16-bit stack pointers. The index and stack registers allowed advanced <b>addressing</b> <b>modes.</b> Program counter relative addressing allowed for the easy creation of position-independent code, while a user stack pointer (U) facilitated the creation of reentrant code.|$|E
50|$|As a result, {{a greater}} number of {{programs}} were able to utilize the enhanced direct page <b>addressing</b> <b>mode</b> versus legacy processors that only included the zero page <b>addressing</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|R
50|$|Additionally, a third index {{register}} (Z) was included, the stack pointer was widened to 16 bits, and the zero page <b>addressing</b> <b>mode</b> was superseded {{by the more}} flexible direct page <b>addressing</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{cylinder}} is {{a division}} of data in a disk drive, as used in the CHS <b>addressing</b> <b>mode</b> of a Fixed Block Architecture disk or the cylinder-head-record (CCHHR) <b>addressing</b> <b>mode</b> of a CKD disk.|$|R
25|$|The 6809 was {{assembler}} source-compatible {{with the}} 6800, though the 6800 had 78 {{instructions to the}} 6809's 59. Some instructions were replaced by more general ones which the assembler translated into equivalent operations and some were even replaced by <b>addressing</b> <b>modes.</b> The instruction set and register complement were highly orthogonal, making the 6809 easier to program than the 6800 or 6502. Like the 6800, the 6809 included an undocumented address bus test instruction which came to be nicknamed Halt and Catch Fire (HCF).|$|E
25|$|MIPS IV is {{the fourth}} version of the architecture. It is a superset of MIPS III and is {{compatible}} with all existing versions of MIPS. MIPS IV was designed to mainly improve floating-point (FP) performance. To improve access to operands, an indexed addressing mode (base + index, both sourced from GPRs) for FP loads and stores was added, as were prefetch instructions for performing memory prefetching and specifying cache hints (these supported both the base + offset and base + index <b>addressing</b> <b>modes).</b>|$|E
25|$|The CDC 6600 {{designed}} by Seymour Cray in 1964 used a load/store architecture {{with only two}} <b>addressing</b> <b>modes</b> (register+register, and register+immediate constant) and 74 opcodes, with the basic clock cycle being 10 {{times faster than the}} memory access time. Partly due to the optimized load/store architecture of the CDC 6600 Jack Dongarra states that it can be considered as a forerunner of modern RISC systems, although a number of other technical barriers needed to be overcome {{for the development of a}} modern RISC system.|$|E
50|$|Within a loop, this <b>addressing</b> <b>mode</b> {{can be used}} to step {{backwards}} {{through all}} the elements of an array or vector. A stack can be implemented by using this mode in conjunction with the previous <b>addressing</b> <b>mode</b> (autoincrement).|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} {{instances}} {{of the architecture}} (System/360 and early System/370), the instruction address was 24 bits; in later instances (XA/370), the instruction address was 31 bits plus a mode bit (24 bit <b>addressing</b> <b>mode</b> if zero; 31 bit <b>addressing</b> <b>mode</b> if one) {{for a total of}} 32 bits.|$|R
25|$|Compared to NOR flash, {{replacing}} single transistors with serial-linked groups adds {{an extra}} level of addressing. Whereas NORflash might address memory by page then word, NANDflash might address it by page, word and bit. Bit-level addressing suits bit-serial applications (such as hard disk emulation), which access only one bit at a time. Execute-in-place applications, {{on the other}} hand, require every bit in a word to be accessed simultaneously. This requires word-level addressing. In any case, both bit and word <b>addressing</b> <b>modes</b> are possible with either NOR or NANDflash.|$|E
25|$|An {{assembler}} program creates object code by translating combinations of mnemonics and syntax for operations and <b>addressing</b> <b>modes</b> into their numerical equivalents. This representation typically includes an operation code ("opcode") {{as well as}} other control bits and data. The assembler also calculates constant expressions and resolves symbolic names for memory locations and other entities. The use of symbolic references is a key feature of assemblers, saving tedious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications. Most assemblers also include macro facilities for performing textual substitution – e.g., to generate common short sequences of instructions as inline, instead of called subroutines.|$|E
25|$|Assembly {{language}} uses a mnemonic {{to represent}} each low-level machine instruction or opcode, typically also each architectural register, flag, etc. Many operations require {{one or more}} operands in order to form a complete instruction and most assemblers can take expressions of numbers and named constants as well as registers and labels as operands, freeing the programmer from tedious repetitive calculations. Depending on the architecture, these elements may also be combined for specific instructions or <b>addressing</b> <b>modes</b> using offsets or other data as well as fixed addresses. Many assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development, to control the assembly process, and to aid debugging.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first drive}} {{interface}} used 22-bit <b>addressing</b> <b>mode</b> {{which resulted in}} a maximum drive capacity of two gigabytes. Later, the first formalized ATA specification used a 28-bit <b>addressing</b> <b>mode</b> through LBA28, allowing for the addressing of 228 (...) sectors (blocks) of 512 bytes each, resulting in a maximum capacity of 128 GiB (137 GB).|$|R
5000|$|The PC-relative <b>addressing</b> <b>mode</b> {{can be used}} to load a {{register}} with a value stored in program memory a short distance away from the current instruction. It {{can be seen as a}} special case of the [...] "base plus offset" [...] <b>addressing</b> <b>mode,</b> one that selects the program counter (PC) as the [...] "base register".|$|R
25|$|Like early {{programming}} languages such as Fortran, Algol, Cobol and Lisp, assemblers {{have been}} available since the 1950s and the first generations of text based computer interfaces. However, assemblers came first as they are far simpler to write than compilers for high-level languages. This is because each mnemonic along with the <b>addressing</b> <b>modes</b> and operands of an instruction translates rather directly into the numeric representations of that particular instruction, without much context or analysis. There have also been several classes of translators and semi automatic code generators with properties similar to both assembly and high level languages, with speedcode as {{perhaps one of the}} better known examples.|$|E
25|$|Some aspects {{attributed}} to the first RISC-labeled designs around 1975 include the observations that the memory-restricted compilers of the time were often unable {{to take advantage of}} features intended to facilitate manual assembly coding, and that complex <b>addressing</b> <b>modes</b> take many cycles to perform due to the required additional memory accesses. It was argued that such functions would be better performed by sequences of simpler instructions if this could yield implementations small enough to leave room for many registers, reducing the number of slow memory accesses. In these simple designs, most instructions are of uniform length and similar structure, arithmetic operations are restricted to CPU registers and only separate load and store instructions access memory. These properties enable a better balancing of pipeline stages than before, making RISC pipelines significantly more efficient and allowing higher clock frequencies.|$|E

Some older [...] software can be run without modification using the Aemulor emulator.|$|E
2500|$|An {{instruction}} set {{is said to}} be orthogonal if it lacks redundancy (i.e., there is only a single instruction {{that can be used to}} accomplish a given task) and is designed such that instructions can use any register in any addressing mode. This terminology results from considering an instruction as a vector whose components are the instruction fields. [...] One field identifies the registers to be operated upon and another specifies the addressing mode. An orthogonal {{instruction set}} uniquely encodes all combinations of registers and <b>addressing</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Motorola 6809 was {{originally}} produced in 1 MHz, 1.5MHz (68A09) and 2MHz (68B09) speed ratings. Faster versions were produced later by Hitachi. It is sometimes {{considered to be}} the conceptual precursor of the Motorola 68000 family of processors, though this is mostly a misunderstanding. The 6809 and 68000 design projects ran partly in parallel and have quite differing architectures as well as radically different implementation principles. However, there {{is a certain amount of}} design philosophy similarity (e.g., considerable orthogonality and flexible <b>addressing</b> <b>modes),</b> some assembly language syntax resemblance, as well as opcode mnemonic similarity, but the 6809 is a derivative of the 6800 whereas the 68000 was a totally new design. An 8-bit data bus version of the 68000 (i.e., the 68008) was intended for use in future 8-bit designs. With little to improve the 6809 marks the end of the evolution of Motorola's 8 bit processors. A [...] micro-controller version with a slightly modified instruction set, the 6811, was discontinued as late as the second decade of the 21st century.|$|E

30|$|The SD/SDHC card {{communication}} protocol in SPI mode is entirely a command-dependent protocol and the card responds to every command with a pre-defined response pattern. In {{the way of}} initialization, first the card is initiated with CMD 0 command. Then, the controller validates the voltage range by generating the CMD 8 command. It also identifies the version of the card (version 2 (SDHC) card or some other cards). Subsequently, the controller generates the application-specific commands such as (CMD 55 + ACMD 41) to complete the initialization process. The controller will continuously generate (CMD 55 + ACMD 41) command until the card initializes itself by giving a “ 00000000 ” response. The SDHC card supports two types of <b>addressing</b> <b>mode.</b> They are block <b>addressing</b> <b>mode</b> and byte <b>addressing</b> <b>mode.</b> The CMD 58 command identifies the <b>addressing</b> <b>mode</b> of the version 2 SDHC card. Also, CMD 16 command is issued to fix the data block length to 512 bytes. After initialization process, the card goes to the idle state until the next command is being generated for single/multiblock read/write.|$|R
