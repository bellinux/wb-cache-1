The experimental delimitation was divided into two groups, which one containing 30 animals, randomly. The first group the animal were inseminated with post-cervical <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>technique,</b> with 1. 5 billons of spermatozoa in 50 ml, and in the second group was executed the intracervical <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>technique,</b> with 3 billons of spermatozoa in 80 ml. The statistic was not parametric analyze (Kruskal-Wallis) and test of de averages by Student-Newman-Keuls (p< 0. 05). The number of return to estrus was 2 in both groups (postcervical artificial insemination vs intracervical artificial insemination), the number of abortions (0 vs 2), the number of farrow (28 vs 26), the farrowing rate (93. 33 % vs 86. 68 %), and the litter size (14. 07 vs 14. 10), respectively. The post-cervical artificial insemination, showed similar results comparing with the intracervical artificial insemination.

40|$|The silkworm, Bombyx mori, has a dimorphic sperm system. The eupyrene sperm is {{the sperm}} to {{fertilize}} eggs and the apyrene sperm plays {{a crucial role}} for assisting fertilization. Heat-treated (331 C for 96 h) Daizo (DH) males, one of the strains in the silkworm, produce only eupyrene sperm, while in triploid males only apyrene sperm are functional. Though both types of males are found to be sterile, double copulation of the two males with a single female greatly increases fertility. Here we examined the fertilizing ability of eupyrene and apyrene sperm by means of an <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>technique</b> previously established in B. mori. Neither the eupyrene sperm collected from DH males, nor the apyrene sperm from triploid males have the ability to fertilize eggs. Artificial insemination with the mixture of eupyrene and apyrene sperm leveled up the frequency of fertilized eggs to more than 80 %. When cryopreserved DH sperm (eupyrene sperm) were subjected to the same experiment, more than 95 % fertilized eggs were obtained. These results confirmed that apyrene sperm play an important and indispensable role in fertilization in B. mori.

The results of systematic anatomic observation on reproductive organs of 53 obsolete male ostriches show that: (1) For ostrich above 2 years old, the testis tends to enlarge in breeding season and shrink in ceased period. When they are mature, the color turns from milk white into the milky grey. With an average body weight 135. 6 ± 6. 50 kg, the ostriches have their testis 678. 7 ± 20. 44 g in weight and 9. 6 ± 3. 43 cm in length on average. (2) For 1 -year-old ostriches before sexual maturity, the penis is smaller and short, shaped as a light pink bar. After sexual maturity, the testis shows a tendency of enlarging in breeding season and shrinking in ceased period. For ostrich above 2 years old, the weight of penis is 870 ± 45. 63 g on average and the length is 30. 1 ± 12. 45 cm on average. The depth of ejaculatory groove is 19. 18 ± 3. 58 mm on average.

40|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of milk production on some reproductive traits, calving intervals between high- and low-producing groups varied by only 9 days (414 vs 423). First-service conception rates were 8 percentage points greater in the low-producing group than in the high-producing group. However, the percentage of cows not yet inseminated that were more than 120 days in milk was 18 percentage points greater in the low- than highproducing herds. When Kansas dairy herds in the DHIA program are evaluated, the higher producing herds seem to have lower firstservice conception rates and more services per conception. However, managers of high-producing herds are doing a better job of servicing cows inseminated earlier in lactation and putting replacements into the milk string at a younger age. This occurs because managers of high-producing herds have reproductive records and heat detection programs that allow them to detect a higher percentage of the cows in heat before 120 days in milk. Fine tuning the reproductive management program also can improve the profitability of a dairy operation.

The species is also protected by law in both Okinawa and Kagoshima prefectures. An <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>technique</b> using hormonal injections could not be applied to the breeding of this species in the laboratory. In this study we naturally bred the species, and tested a laboratory farming technique using several male and female E. andersoni pairs collected from Okinawa, Amami, and Tokunoshima Islands and subsequently maintained in near-biotopic breeding cages. Among 378 eggs derived from 17 females, 319 (84. 4 %) became normal tailbud embryos, 274 (72. 5 %) hatched normally, 213 (56. 3 %) metamorphosed normally, and 141 (37. 3 %) became normal two-month-old newts; in addition, 77 one- to three-year-old Tokunoshima newts and 32 Amami larvae are currently still growing normally.

40|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>technique</b> is an {{effective}} tool for rapid improvement in the genetic potential and control of reproductive disorder in farm animals. Use of AI is still limited in buffalo, the main dairy animal of South Asia. Identification of high fertility semen donor buffalo bulls for AI would increase its popularity among farmers. The potential fertility of bulls can be measured with field fertility rates, but this procedure is expensive and time consuming. Therefore {{in the present study}} in vitro fertilization was tested to predict the in vivo fertility of buffalo bulls. Studies were carried out to standardize protocols of in vitro fertilization in buffalo for in vitro testing of bull fertility. Overall recovery rate of good quality oocytes from buffalo ovaries was 1. 3 COCs/ovary. Oocytes recovered by aspiration method gave a better in vitro maturation rate (expansion = 86. 4 % and GVBD = 85 %) than those recovered by slicing method. There was a trend for better cleavage rate with static culture system supplemented with oestrus buffalo serum, although the difference was non significant compared to static systems with FCS, and flux culture systems with either OBS or FCS. The capacitation of buffalo spermatozoa with higher heparin concentrations (50 - 100 Âµg/ml) and 30 min incubation time improved in vitro fertilization rates in buffalo (cleavage rate 75 - 80 % and cleavage index 62 - 74 %). Better cleavage rate and cleavage index was observed in the oocytes inseminated with spermatozoa separated with swimup method as compared to Percoll gradient (P< 0. 001). There were differences among bulls in the cleavage rate and cleavage index of oocytes following IVF with spermatozoa harvested by swim-up method (P< 0. 05). In vitro fertilization rates did not differ between vitrified "germinal vesicle stage oocytesâ€�and fresh oocytes. Vitrified oocytes inseminated with frozen-thawed semen of 4 buffalo bulls showed different cleavage indices (P< 0. 05). Among the spermatological and IVF parameters, cleavage rate was identified as being most predictive of conception rate and accounted for 75 % of variation (P = 0. 0001). The predictive equation formed by spermatological parameters accounted for 52 % and that for IVF parameters 81 % of the variation.

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of the beef industry in northern Australia is composed of tropically adapted cattle, due to their propensity for tick and drought resistance. It has been suggested that a large conical cervix is responsible for decreased fertility in these cattle where a conical cervix is defined as having a caudal to cranial cervical diameter difference of greater than 15 mm. Studies were conducted in order to ascertain the incidence of conical cervix and the heritability of cervical diameter in tropically adapted beef cattle in Queensland. An initial study was conducted on 246 Santa Gertrudis females from four properties. Caudal and cranial cervical measurements were taken with transrectal B-mode ultrasound using the Aloka SSD_ 500 scanner and a 5 MHz linear probe. Analysis of data was by AS REML, including the effects of sire, parity and property. Sire was included as a random effect, whereas parity and property were included in the analysis as fixed effects. Sire effects were significant. A sire model was used to calculate a heritability estimate of 0. 60 ± 0. 27 for uterine cervical diameter. An analysis of variance showed that parity had a significant effect on cervical diameter, with cervical diameter increasing as parity level increased. Property had no effect on cervical diameter A more detailed study was conducted on 850 cattle from five properties. Breeds represented were Santa Gertrudis, Brahman, Brahman Cross, Belmont Red and Belmond Red Cross. Caudal and cranial cervical diameter, sire, parity and breed were recorded for each animal. Once again, sire effects were significant resulting in a heritability estimate of 0. 46 ± 0. 15. An analysis of variance showed parity effects to be significant (α= 0. 05) while property and breed effects did not influence cervical diameter. However property and breed were heavily confounded due to the practice of many stud breeders of running one breed per property. Breed and parity were also heavily confounded as Santa Gertrudis breed cattle were the only cattle available that had already produced one or more calves. In order {{to examine the relationship between}} cervical diameter and liveweight, a subset of 568 cows from the above group also had their weight in kilograms recorded. Animals were chosen for this study based on the availability of scales at each property. A Pearson correlation test resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0. 043 between uterine cervical diameter and animal liveweight. This demonstrates that there is a negligible linear relationship between cervical diameter and liveweight. The relationship between cervix diameter and calving outcome was not investigated in this study. Although calving records were obtained for a number of animals in this study, many variables affecting calving outcome could not be accounted for such as disease outbreaks, <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>technique</b> and other management factors. Previous studies have suggested a relationship between cervical diameter and infertility but the present study was unable to draw conclusions regarding this. Although this study has shown that uterine cervical diameter is a moderately to highly heritable trait, it is not recommended that producers cull animals based on their uterine cervical dimensions at this stage, as the relationship between uterine cervical diameter and fertility is still poorly understood...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of season on reproductive traits of Saanen bucks in comparison to Nubian and Nubian x Saanen Crossbred bucks. The study was carried under the normal climatic conditions of Sudan, in order to provide necessary data to use these bucks in genetic improvement programmes, using <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>technique.</b> Eleven mature bucks (4 Nubian, 3 Saanen and 4 Nubian x Saanen Crossbred) were used in this study to prepare semen samples which were collected with an artificial vagina. Sexual behaviour of the bucks was assessed by recording the reaction time to mating. Body measurements including scrotal circumference, heart girth and body condition scores were recorded throughout the study period. The study examined the relationship between season and sperm characteristics (volume of ejaculate, concentration, physical appearance, mass activity, sperm motility percent, post-thaw sperm motility, dead sperm percent and abnormal sperm percent). Semen samples were diluted with either Tris or skim milk-based extenders. The diluted semen was preserved at + 5 0 C and was evaluated for motility at 0 hour, 24 hours and 48 hours. Another proportion of the semen was preserved in liquid nitrogen at – 196 0 C and examined for sperm motility after 48 hours. A total of 90 female goats (60 Nubian and 30 Nubian x Saanen Crossbred) were used in the fertility trial. The goats were selected and grouped according to the breeds of bucks used to prepare fresh and frozen semen. All groups were synchronized with intravaginal progesterone-impregnated sponges or with controlled internal drug release (CIDR) device for 12 days. At time of sponge withdrawal, all goats received an intramuscular injection of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) hormone. Following termination of treatment, the goats were artificially inseminated 48 hours latter with 0. 5 ml of either fresh-diluted or frozen-thawed semen of Nubian, Saanen or Crossbred bucks. Conception rates were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and ultrasonic means. 4 The results obtained indicated that sexual desire was significantly affected by breed. Nubian and Crossbred bucks showed the strongest sexual desire (43. 23 ± 8. 72 and 41. 56 ± 9. 54 seconds, respectively), while Saanen bucks showed the slowest sexual desire (56. 77 ± 13. 38 seconds). The influence of season on sexual desire was significant. The shortest reaction time was observed during autumn and winter, while during summer all bucks showed weak sexual desire. Complete lack of libido was observed among Saanen bucks during May and June. Sexual desire showed significant correlations with ambient temperature and daylight for Saanen bucks, while these correlatios for Nubian and Crossbred bucks were not significant. Scrotal circumference measurements were significantly affected by breed. The highest value was recorded among Saanen bucks (26. 75 cm), while the lowest measurement (24. 68) was observed among Nubian bucks, although in all breeds, scrotal circumference increased with age. Effect of season on scrotal circumference revealed significant difference in all the three breeds of bucks. The highest measurements were recorded during summer, while the lowest measurements were observed during winter. The body growth, measured by recording the heart girth (HG) and body condition scores was significantly affected by breed. Although Saanen bucks recorded the highest measurements for heart girth and body condition score (93. 20 and 4. 12, respectively), Crossbred bucks recorded the faster rate of growth among the different groups. Effect of season on body growth measurements revealed non significant difference among Saanen bucks, while for Nubian and Crossbred bucks, it was significant. Semen characteristics of all groups were not affected by breed except for volume of ejaclate. Saanen bucks produced the greatest value (0. 98 ml), while the smallest volume was recorded for Nubian bucks (0. 82 ml). The influence of season on ejaculate volume was significant. Greater ejaculate volumes were observed during summer and autumn, while during winter, the smallest ejaculate volumes were recorded for the three groups. The influence of season on sperm cell concentration was significant. Higher values were observed during autumn (2. 55 ± 0. 62 x 109, 2. 55 ± 0. 92 x 109 and 2. 54 ± 0. 40 x 109 for Nubian, Saanen and Crossbred bucks, respectively), while the lowest sperm concentration values were observed during summer. 5 Physical appearance of semen showed thick-creamy semen during autumn, while thin milky semen was observed during summer for the three breeds of bucks. Influence of season on mass activity of semen was significant. Mean values of mass activity scores were higher during autumn (3. 39 ± 0. 49, 3. 42 ± 0. 50 and 3. 32 ± 0. 47, for Nubian, Saanen and Crossbred bucks, respectively), while a progressive decrease was observed during summer. Higher values of sperm motility (65. 53 ± 5. 89 %, 65. 59 ± 8. 00 % and 67. 50 ± 6. 45 % for Nubian, Saanen and Crossbred bucks, respectively) were observed during autumn, while the lowest values were observed during summer. The influence of season on post-thaw sperm motility was significant. Semen frozen during autumn and winter (Nubian: 29. 64 ± 6. 07 % and 33. 10 ± 11. 89 %, respectively; Saanen: 36. 42 ± 10. 14 % and 35. 33 ± 9. 15 %, respectively and the Crossbred: 30. 00 ± 10. 04 % and 35. 00 ± 12. 03 %, respectively) had the highest values. During summer lower mean values were observed (27. 18 ± 9. 65 %, 20. 00 ± 5. 64 % and 23. 43 ± 8. 31 % for Nubian, Saanen and Crossbred bucks, respectively). The influence of season on the incidence of dead spermatozoa was significant. Lower values of dead spermatozoa were recorded during autumn (10. 25 ± 2. 78 %, 10. 52 ± 3. 80 % and 10. 25 ± 4. 23 % for Nubian, Saanen and Crossbred bucks, respectively). Highest percentages of dead spermatozoa were observed during summer for the three breeds of bucks (16. 37 ± 1. 20, 17. 25 ± 3. 33 and 16. 87 ± 3. 30, respectively), while winter showed intermediate values with regard to this characteristic. A significant negative correlations (r = - 0. 80, - 0. 80 and – 0. 70) between percentage of dead spermatozoa and humidity for Nubian, Saanen and Crossbred bucks, respectively were obtained. All types of sperm abnormalities studied showed significant seasonal variations. Mean values of abnormal spermatozoa (morphologic defects), followed the same trend of dead spermatozoa. It was lower during autumn (7. 00 ± 1. 98 %, 6. 85 ± 2. 68 % and 7. 67 ± 3. 42 % for Nubian, Saanen and Crossbred bucks, respectively), while the poorest quality semen was collected during summer for the three breeds of bucks. A significant negative correlations (r = - 0. 78, - 0. 86 and – 0. 67) between percentage of abnormal spermatozoa and humidity for Nubian, Saanen and Crossbred bucks, respectively were recorded. 6 In cold stored semen, sperm motility consistently dropped after one day of preservation, although its mean percentage after chilling for 48 hours was 43. 12 in Tris-based extender and 42. 71 in skim milk extender. In frozen stored semen, sperm motility remained at 31 % or more in Tris-based extender, while it dropped to 10. 85 % in skim milk extender. The fertility of the sperms assessed by the conception rates of goats, was not significantly different after artificial insemination with fresh-diluted (46. 66 %, 53. 33 % and 53. 33 % for Nubian, Saanen and Crossbred bucks, respectively) or with frozen-stored semen (40 %, 46. 66 % and 46. 66 % for the three breeds, respectively). It can be concluded that the season affected significantly almost all parameters measured. The best semen was produced during autumn and winter. Fresh diluted semen can be preserved at + 5 0 C for up to 48 hours using Tris or skim milk extenders, whereas frozen stored semen can be preserved successfully using Tris-based extender. Tris-based diluent with 2. 5 % egg yolk content was superior for freezing goat semen than skim milk extender.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} semen fertilizing potential {{is of great}} importance in determining the acceptability of processed semen for breeding purposes. A good sperm preparation technique results in a sample with high viability and motility and also takes into account other parameters such as the capacitation and apoptotic state which could compromise the ability to fertilize an oocyte. In this study, we investigate the effects of 4 sperm preparation techniques (a dextran/swim-up procedure, discontinuous Percoll density gradient centrifugation, sucrose washing, and filtration) on ram sperm quality parameters. Besides the evaluation of viability and the capacitation state, we also analyzed the apoptotic status of the sperm samples by assessing the phosphatidylserine translocation and caspase- 3 and- 7 activities. This is the first report, to our knowledge, that evidences the presence of active caspases in ram sperm. The results confirm the better ability of the dextran/swimup procedure to select nonapoptotic spermatozoa, in addition to viable and noncapacitated sperm, compared with other sperm preparation methods. This should be considered to enhance results of <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>techniques</b> in ovine reproduction...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} an optimum {{frequency of}} semen collection, {{so as to}} improve the efficacy of <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>techniques</b> and selective breeding programmes in duck farming. Methods: Thirty two ejaculates were collected by abdominal massage method from two groups of drakes, with 10 in each, at one day and two day intervals respectively. Routine seminal attributes such as volume, colour, pH, spermatozoa concentration, number of spermatozoa per ejaculate, individual motility, live sperm percentage, total sperm abnormalities and time taken to reduce Methylene blue (MBRT) were studied for comparison of their values in one day and two days of interval of semen collection. Twenty female laying ducks maintained for examining the fertility percent were regularly inseminated with 0. 1 mL of neat pooled semen for fertility test. Results: The test of significance indicated a significant decrease (P< 0. 05) in the time taken to reduce methylene blue, a highly {{significant increase in the}} sperm concentration (P< 0. 01) and number of spermatozoa per ejaculation (P< 0. 01) and a non significant improvement in the seminal characteristics with respect to semen volume and mass motility was found in the ejaculates of two day interval than that of one day interval collections. Conclusion: Collection of semen at two days intervals is recommended for enhancing fertility in <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> of duck. The methylene-blue reduction test, along with spermatozoa count and initial motility estimates were reported to be better indicator of semen quality...|$|R

The positive effect of vaginal misoprostol leading to an improved clinical pregnancy rate is not clearly understood. The known effects of prostaglandin E on increasing myometrial contractility and potential relaxation of tubal isthmus may all facilitate fertilization potential. We intended to investigate here the effects of misoprostol on preg-nancy rates and the outcome of intrauterine insemination. Materials and Methods: All patients (age, ≤ 35 years), whose data on male and female diagnosis was available, were inclu-ded in the study. The data of 34 cycles, determined as the control group, with either unexplained infertility or ovulatory dysfunction, having undergone therapeutic insemination {{in an effort to}} establish pregnancy were retrospectively studied.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{well known}} that {{assisted}} reproductive techniques are implemented and used worldwide in livestock production, having as aim to allow high genetic animals to produce more descendants in a shorter period of time than possible naturally. They have enabled animal breeders to optimize production and reproduction efficiency of their animals by improving selective traits and accelerating the genetic progress. <b>Artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>techniques</b> in sheep increase the selection differential, being one of the main biotechnologies that are used extensively in the animal livestock. The present research has in view to assess the influence of collection techniques upon some morph metric parameters of the ram sperm. There were analyzed 10 native purebred and crossbred rams from different age category. The semen collection was made by artificial vagina and with the aid of electro ejaculator. At every semen collection, there were recorded the main morphologic features of sperm and also the primary morph metric head sperm indices: head length, head width, head area and head perimeter. The influence of the collection technique was in view along two years, studying the dynamics of the analyzed sperm indices through the computer image analysis. Descriptive statistics were performed on the recorded data to determine normality. Statistical analysis was performed as per standard statistical methods. The results reveal {{the fact that there were}} no morph metric differences between the two collection methods. The lack of significant differences indicated that other factors may affect the reproduction efficiency between the two methods. The study clearly demonstrates that there is a variation in reproductive parameters in the rams which could be studied at the molecular level to unveil any genomic markers associated with low fertility and/or infertility. The results obtained for this part of the overall study emphasizes further research to correlate morph metric traits of ram sperm with conception rate of ewes to determine whether morph metric traits need to be included in sperm quality tests for <b>artificial</b> <b>inseminations...</b>|$|R
40|$|In vitro {{preservation}} of the male gamete is a challenge {{in the development of}} <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>techniques</b> for domestic animals. Specific strategies and diluents have been developed for the {{preservation of}} the fertilizing ability of the semen for each species. However, the epididymal medium has been demonstrated to be the best sperm environment to maintain sperm viability over several days and weeks for mammals. The aims of this study were to evaluate the motility and in vivo fertility of ram epididymal spermatozoa when the semen was stored for up to 4 days at 4 °C undiluted in epididymal plasma. The study was undertaken with two ovine breeds (Ile de France and Corriedale). The motility of epididymal spermatozoa was better preserved in the undiluted epididymal fluid than when epididymal spermatozoa were diluted in classic ovine extender such as skim milk. During storage, the decrease in the percentage of motile sperm was lower if the epididymal spermatozoa were collected immediately after epididymal sampling than 24 h after castration or animal death. The fertility obtained after cryo{{preservation of the}} stored sperm and subsequent intrauterine insemination ranged from 55 % to 24 % following 24 to 96 -h sperm storage. There was a linear regression relationship between fertility and the number of motile sperm inseminated for both breeds.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} which result from synchronizing the estrous period in a ewe flock. In {{situations where the}} ewes are not hand bred to the ram, the synchronization of estrus makes the application of <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> (AI) <b>techniques</b> more efficient. Detection of estrus usually is more reliable in a synchronized flock. Only 3 to 4 days are needed to detect estrus in 90 percent of a synchronized flock, whereas 16 to 18 days are normally required. This allows the AI technician to plan the number of breedings and have semen available. When hormones are given in the feed, an opportunity is presented for improving the nutritional status of the flock during the breeding period. Synchronization coupled with AI will increase the genetic uniformity of the lamb crop as well as uniformity of age. Attention and labor required at lambing could be easily scheduled and concentrated within {{a short period of}} time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In ratite farming, the low male {{to female}} ratio in the mating system restricts genetic {{improvement}} and prevents {{reduction of the}} number of males kept on-farm for fertilisation of the female flock. These issues can be overcome and the industry can better realise its potential by using <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> (AI) technology. It is the only practical method for intensive genetic improvement of reproduction and the production of eggs, chicks, oil, meat and leather. For AI to be feasible, we need reliable methods for semen collection, <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination,</b> prolonged storage of spermatozoa in the female tract, high rates of lay, efficient protocols for semen storage, and a panel of quantitative methods for measuring true fertility and hatchability, sperm supply rates in vivo and sperm viability in vitro. For both emus and ostriches, prolonged sperm storage in females has already been demonstrated. Methods for semen collection and <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination,</b> using animal-friendly <b>techniques,</b> have also been developed. Semen storage and cryopreservation protocols are yet to be optimised and we still need to overcome the male-dependent rate of lay, but adoption of AI technology by the ratite industries is now feasible. It also seems likely that these technologies will be relevant to wild ratites that need intensive conservation efforts, such as cassowaries, rheas and ostrich subspecies...|$|R
40|$|African {{wild dogs}} have a complex pack {{structure}} with separate {{male and female}} dominance hierarchies in which reproduction is typically exclusive to the alpha male and female. Current efforts to maintain genetic diversity involve translocation of live animals in captivity, a process that involves the combination {{of male and female}} single-sex groups to form a new social pack. Due to their complex social structure, such introductions are difficult: regularly leading to aggression and injuries to the animals. Moreover, this may not result in breeding among genetically valuable individuals if they do not become dominant. To overcome these translocation-associated problems of intra-pack aggression our team has studied a number of facets of basic reproduction as well as stress and behavioural management in African wild dogs with the goal of developing strategies for semen cryopreservation and <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> as a key to the introduction of new genes into existing stable packs (Van den Berghe et al. 2012, Anim Reprod Sci 133, 1 - 9). We began by establishing detailed reproductive and adrenal hormone profiles from multiple females in several reproductive states in both captive and free-ranging populations. Faecal samples from captive females in four European institutions and from wild males and females in South Africa were analysed for oestradiol, progestagens, testosterone and glucocorticoids. Captive data demonstrated that female wild dogs have reproductive characteristics similar to other canids, such as spontaneous ovulation and obligate pseudopregnancy. Almost all adult females became pseudopregnant, implying that the mechanism of reproductive suppression in this sex is likely to be behavioural rather than physiological. This was supported by data from free-ranging populations. Adrenal activity in captive and free-ranging animals was measured by faecal cortisol metabolites. Captive females had higher concentrations than free-ranging females. Glucocorticoid concentrations were more variable in captive individuals, whereas in both wild males and females, they were highest during gestation and denning. Adrenal activity in males, but not females, was also affected by age, with the highest glucocorticoid concentrations measured in yearlings. We have also investigated the use of dog appeasing pheromone (DAP) collars to down-regulate aggression associated with the formation of new packs in captivity. Our initial findings indicate that DAP may reduce baseline stress levels in females and, when applied during regrouping of same-sex individuals, results in a relative reduction in observed levels of aggression. Building on these findings, work is underway to develop a semen bank and <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>techniques.</b> Although reproductive suppression in females is likely to be behavioural, the effect of dominance on male fertility is still unresolved. We have begun investigating the relationship between hierarchy and sperm quality across the seasons. This will guide our development of a robust semen collection and freezing protocol that will permit the establishment of a high-quality semen bank. We are also progressing with non-invasive techniques to predict ovulation for timed <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> of females. These techniques must first be established in captivity before our ultimate goal to implement them as tools for genetic meta-population management in semi-captive and free-ranging populations...|$|R
40|$|Inbreeding {{can have}} {{profound}} {{negative effects on}} individuals by reducing fertility and viability. In populations, inbreeding depression can reduce growth rates and increases extinction risk. The aims of this thesis are to investigate inbreeding depression in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and to study the evolution of mechanisms for inbreeding avoidance in females, using guppies from a feral population in Queensland, Australia. Male guppies are highly polymorphic in their sexual ornamentation, indeed they show {{one of the most}} extreme polymorphisms observed in nature. Female guppies exhibit complex mate choice based on preferences for ornamentation, as well as social context. I aim is to examine how these factors of inbreeding avoidance alter sexual selection. In male guppies I found strong inbreeding depression in male sperm numbers, which is amplified under semi-natural compared to laboratory conditions (Chapter 2). Moreover, inbreeding depression results in low fertility under sperm competition: an experiment using <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>techniques</b> reveals that highly inbred males are heavily disadvantaged in gaining paternity (Chapter 3). On population level, inbreeding depression is manifest in reduced growth rates, predominantly {{in the early stages of}} inbreeding (Chapter 4). Population growth at inbreeding coefficients f= 0. 375 - 0. 59 did not seem to lead to inbreeding depression, whereas lower levels of inbreeding reduced population growth. Although the growth rates in inbred populations appear normal, severe inbreeding depression is uncovered after outbred immigrants are added. Specifically, male immigrants are most efficient in short-term genetic rescue, probably due to insemination of large numbers of females whereas females are limited in the number of eggs they can produce (Chapter 4). Male ornamental traits show significant inbreeding depression in semi-natural conditions only (Chapters 2 & 3). Inbreeding avoidance mechanisms seem to have evolved in females: they prefer courtship displays of non-inbred males (Chapter 2), unfamiliar males (Chapter 5) and males with rare patterns (Chapter 6). This preference might increase the mating success of immigrants, and may have evolved to facilitate the avoidance of inbreeding. Together with context-independent preferences for ornament combinations (Chapter 6), it also offers an explanation for the maintenance of polymorphism in this species...|$|R

The specific pathogen free (SPF) larvae {{were obtained from the}} SPF wild caught broodstock spawned in captivity. The SPF post-larvae were reared to mature entirely in the disinfected medium in circulation system. It was found that male shrimp matured far earlier than female shrimp. Maturation of male shrimp was determined by appearing of the ampoules observed between the fifth pereiopod and the first pleopod. The first maturation of male was observed within 6 months at an average body weight of 11 ± 2 g (n = 6). Sperm quantity and quality were examined in shrimp of 12 months old with an average body weight of 48 ± 3 g (n = 5). The average sperm count per spermatophore was 29. 7 ± 16. 5 × 10 6 with viability of 79. 0 ± 11. 1 %. Maturation of female shrimp was determined by appearing of the gravid ovaries of stage 3 - 4 observed on dorsal part of abdominal segments. The first maturation of female was found within 16 months with an average body weight of 78 ± 4 g (n = 2). The other group of 12 month-old female shrimp was manipulated to mature using eyestalk ablation and <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>techniques.</b> Spawning characteristics of the ablated shrimp found to vary among individuals.
