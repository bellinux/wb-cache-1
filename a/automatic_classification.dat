25|$|Currently one of {{the most}} active areas of {{knowledge}} representation research are projects associated with the semantic web. The semantic web seeks to add a layer of semantics (meaning) on top of the current Internet. Rather than indexing web sites and pages via keywords, the semantic web creates large ontologies of concepts. Searching for a concept will be more effective than traditional text only searches. Frame languages and <b>automatic</b> <b>classification</b> play a big part in the vision for the future semantic web. The <b>automatic</b> <b>classification</b> gives developers technology to provide order on a constantly evolving network of knowledge. Defining ontologies that are static and incapable of evolving on the fly would be very limiting for Internet-based systems. The classifier technology provides the ability to deal with the dynamic environment of the Internet.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge {{representation}} and reasoning {{are a key}} enabling technology for the Semantic web. Languages based on the Frame model with <b>automatic</b> <b>classification</b> provide a layer of semantics {{on top of the}} existing Internet. Rather than searching via text strings as is typical today {{it will be possible to}} define logical queries and find pages that map to those queries. The automated reasoning component in these systems is an engine known as the classifier. Classifiers focus on the subsumption relations in a knowledge base rather than rules. A classifier can infer new classes and dynamically change the ontology as new information becomes available. This capability is ideal for the ever changing and evolving information space of the Internet.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Puerto Rico {{was invited}} {{to play at the}} 2005 Stanković Continental Champions' Cup in Beijing, where it lost all five games and ended up {{finishing}} in 6th place. Still, having failed to qualify directly to the 2006 World Championship by achieving a 7th place at the 2005 FIBA Americas Championship in Santo Domingo, due to its great tradition, on November 2005, Puerto Rico received an invitation to participate in the World tournament as a wildcard, along with Italy, Serbia and Montenegro and Turkey. En route to the World Championship, Puerto Rico won bronze at the 2006 CentroBasket, losing the <b>automatic</b> <b>classification</b> to the 2008 tournament, but recovering in time to earn gold at the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games. Later, at the group play stage of the 2006 World Championship, which was contested in Japan, Puerto Rico started with victories over Senegal and the People's Republic of China, but lost ties against the United States, Italy and Slovenia. The application of a second tiebreaker by points differential to Slovenia, China and Puerto Rico, each with a winning percentage of [...]400, placed Puerto Rico fifth in Group D, preventing the team from advancing to the knockout round {{for the first time since}} 1986; Puerto Rico ultimately placed 17th out of twenty-four, that being its shyest performance in a long time. The following year began with Puerto Rico earning its fifth silver medal at the 2007 Pan American Games, followed by the team's first participation in a CaribeBasket tournament, debuting against Trinidad & Tobago. Although the team didn't have the participation of Daniel Santiago or Rick Apodaca, Puerto Rico won the tournament undefeated, which meant its classification to the 2008 CentroBasket tournament. Later that year, Puerto Rico started to host an exhibition tournament called the Marchand Continental Championship Cup in order to prepare for the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship. After playing against Brazil, Canada and Argentina, Puerto Rico lost all three games, ending up in fourth place. The year ended with a bronze at the FIBA Americas Championship. On January 31, 2008, a draw took place for the FIBA Preolympic tournament, which placed Puerto Rico in the same group as Croatia and Cameroon, where its winner would have to face the second place of Group C. Following this event, the president of the National Superior Basketball League confirmed that the team would play exhibition games at the 2008 Bamberg Super Cup in Germany against Greece, Slovenia and the host, beginning on July 4, 2008. Then, a second set of exhibition games would follow, scheduled to start on July 8, 2008, in Slovenia: the 2008 Alpos International Cup, where the team would face New Zealand, Iran and the hosts. After these preparatory tournaments, the team would train until the Preolympic tournament's beginning. The team began practicing on May 19, 2008, and included several players that were under consideration for inclusion by Cintrón. On June 4, 2008, Daniel Santiago confirmed that he would abandon his international retirement and play with Puerto Rico in the Preolympic tournament. Santiago announced that he would join the team in July, following an exhibition game. Javier Mojica, Alejandro Carmona and Joel Jones were included in as potential members in the preliminary team. On July 1, 2008, hours before the team was scheduled to travel to Europe, Ángelo Reyes was excluded after not establishing communication with the directives. Reyes was replaced with Alex Falcón. Subsequently, Reyes asked for a dispensation to attend personal matters, noting that he intended to join the team in a week; however, he was not included due to time constraints. In the first game at the Bamberg Super Cup, Puerto Rico defeated Germany with a team composed mostly of reserve players, as Carlos Arroyo, Santiago, Larry Ayuso and Carmelo Lee were attending other compromises. Puerto Rico continued playing with these players, finishing 2nd, after losing the final game to Greece, who entered the cup with their entire lineup. Santiago and Ayuso joined the practices on July 5, 2008, when Puerto Rico traveled to Slovenia, where the Alpos International Cup was being held. The first match in the tournament was a victory against New Zealand, followed by another victory in the semifinals over Iran. At the end, Puerto Rico finished second, losing to Slovenia in the finals. The Preolympic tournament began on July 14, 2008, but Puerto Rico's debut came the following day, when the team defeated Cameroon and advanced to the second round, due to a loss that the African team had suffered during the first day of competition. On its second game, the team lost to Croatia, but in the quarterfinals, defeated Slovenia. The team didn't qualify to the Olympics, after losing to Greece in the semifinals and to Germany in the tournament's bronze medal game.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} of information imposes new demands of content management. The goal of <b>automatic</b> audio <b>classification</b> and content description {{is to meet}} the rising need for efficient content management. In this thesis, we have studied <b>automatic</b> audio <b>classification</b> and content description. As description of audio is a broad field that incorporates many techniques, {{an overview of the}} main directions in current research is given. However, a detailed study of <b>automatic</b> audio <b>classification</b> is conducted and a speech/music classifier is designed. To evaluate the performance of a classifier, a general test-bed in Matlab is implemented. The classification algorithm for the speech/music classifier is a k-Nearest Neighbor, which is commonly used for the task. A variety of features are studied and their effectiveness is evaluated. Based on feature's effectiveness, a robust speech/music classifier is designed and a classification accuracy of 98. 2 % for 5 seconds long analysis windows is achieved.

40|$|Musical genre classification: Is {{it worth}} {{pursuing}} {{and how can}} it be improved? Research in <b>automatic</b> genre <b>classification</b> has been producing increasingly small performance gains in recent years, with the result that some have suggested that such research should be abandoned in favor of more general similarity research. It has been further argued that genre classification is of limited utility as a goal in itself because of the ambiguities and subjectivity inherent to genre. This paper presents a number of counterarguments that emphasize the importance of continuing research in <b>automatic</b> genre <b>classification.</b> Specific strategies for overcoming current performance limitations are discussed, and a brief review of background research in musicology and psychology relating to genre is presented. Insights from these highly relevant fields are generally absent from discourse within the MIR community, and it is hoped that this will help to encourage a more multi-disciplinary approach to <b>automatic</b> genre <b>classification</b> in the future...|$|R
