5|$|In {{this period}} Ruisdael started {{painting}} coastal scenes and sea-pieces, influenced by Simon de Vlieger and Jan Porcellis. Among {{the most dramatic}} is Rough Sea at a Jetty, with a restricted palette of only black, white, blue and a few brown earth colours. However, forest scenes remain a subject of choice, such as the Hermitage's most famous Ruisdael, <b>A</b> <b>Wooded</b> Marsh, dated 1665, which depicts a primeval scene with broken birches and oaks, and branches reaching for the sky amidst an overgrown pond.|$|E
5|$|After this intersection, Old Baltimore Pike {{continues}} past suburban neighborhoods, {{gaining a}} center left-turn lane and intersecting Salem Church Road. Farther east, the highway reaches a junction with DE 273 in <b>a</b> <b>wooded</b> area. At this point, the road narrows to two lanes again and {{heads into the}} community of Christiana. Here, the highway intersects DE 7, where it turns north and follows that route through residential areas. The road comes to an interchange with DE 1 {{to the west of}} the Christiana Mall, where DE 7 continues north along with DE 1 and Old Baltimore Pike reaches a dead end.|$|E
5|$|Following Ruisdael's trip to Germany, his landscapes {{took on a}} more heroic character, with forms {{becoming}} {{larger and}} more prominent. A view of Bentheim Castle, dated 1653, {{is just one of}} a dozen of Ruisdael's depictions of a particular castle in Germany, almost all of which pronounce its position on a hilltop. Significantly, Ruisdael made numerous changes to the castle's setting (it is actually on an unimposing low hill) culminating in a 1653 version which shows it on <b>a</b> <b>wooded</b> mountain. These variations are considered by art historians to be evidence of Ruisdael's compositional skills.|$|E

5|$|It {{was written}} in the {{afternoon}} in the intervals of some other writing. The desk was in an upstairs room, by a window looking down <b>a</b> <b>wooded</b> hill. It {{was written in}} a little notebook in which his father and mother wrote out copies of several of their poems and, in most cases, added the date of composition. On one page the first two lines of 'Trees' appear, with the date, February 2, 1913, and on another page, further on in the book, is the full text of the poem. It was dedicated to his wife's mother, Mrs. Henry Mills Alden, who was endeared to all her family.|$|E
5|$|M-40 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with US12 in rural Cass County. Running north through farm fields, the highway rounds Bar Lake {{and into the}} community of Jones. The area around Jones has a few more lakes in <b>a</b> <b>wooded</b> setting. As the trunkline continues north, it passes back into farm lands. The road curves around to the northwest as it passes between Bogart Lake and Streeters Mill Pond near Dutch Settlement Road. M-40 follows Centre Street into Marcellus. When the highway meets {{the western end of}} M-216 in town, M-40 turns west along Main Street and runs out of town. The roadway returns to a northerly course, and later it curves northwesterly again near Cedar Lake near the Van Buren County line.|$|E
5|$|NY117 begins {{just north}} of the village of Sleepy Hollow at an {{interchange}} with US9 (Broadway) in the town of Mount Pleasant. The route proceeds generally northeastward along Phelps Way, a four-lane, divided highway bypass of Sleepy Hollow and Kykuit, the Rockefeller family's estate. For its first , the highway runs through <b>a</b> <b>wooded</b> area along the northern edge of the Rockefeller State Park Preserve, crossing under several of the park's hiking and walking trails. Phelps Way ends at the northeastern tip of the park, where NY117 intersects with the northern terminus of NY448 at Bedford Road. While NY448 ends here, Bedford Road continues on as part of NY117.|$|E

5|$|NY129 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY9A (South Riverside Avenue) {{in the village}} of Croton-on-Hudson, next to U.S. Route9 (US9). NY129 proceeds northward from NY9A along Maple Street, a two-lane commercial street through the village. At Van Cortlandt Park, NY129 becomes residential, passing Croton-Harmon High School as it bends to the northeast. At the junction with Grand Street, NY129 continues northeast on Grand Street, which is a two-lane residential street. The route continues northeast through the village, crossing an intersection with Quaker Bridge Road before becoming <b>a</b> <b>wooded</b> lane in the town of Cortlandt. In Cortlandt, NY129 continues north as Grand Street, paralleling a local creek and entering Croton Dam Plaza.|$|E
5|$|Now running northwest, NY128 crosses through North Castle as a two-lane {{residential}} roadway, paralleling Wrights Mill Road into Wampus Pond County Park. Through the parkland, NY128 bends northwest, {{running along}} {{the northern edge of}} the park, and passing Wampus Pond. NY128 soon enters the town of New Castle, where it changes names to Armonk Road on its way north, remaining a two-lane residential street. The route winds its way north via several bends, soon becoming <b>a</b> <b>wooded</b> roadway through New Castle. Residences remain spacious, paralleling NY128 into the village of Mount Kisco. Now in Mount Kisco, NY128 retains the name Armonk Road until a junction with Lexington Avenue, where NY128 proceeds north on Park Avenue, which intersects with NY117 (Main Street), where the NY128 designation ends.|$|E
5|$|On {{the steep}} grassy slopes above the River Avon, Bristol rockcress (Arabis scabra) which {{is unique to}} the Avon Gorge can be seen {{flowering}} in April; orchids and western spiked speedwell (Veronica spicata) are common in June and July. In autumn the woodland hosts over 300 species of fungi. Bilberry, a scarce plant in the Bristol area, is found in Leigh Woods, as is the parasitic plant yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys). Lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) was discovered here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley; there is doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. Green-flowered Helleborine (Epipactis phyllanthes) is found {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in <b>a</b> <b>wooded</b> area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods.|$|E

5|$|At about 18:00, {{the prisoners}} were divided into groups. Each group of 10 to 20 was loaded onto a truck and transported several hundred metres (yards) from the {{building}} towards <b>a</b> <b>wooded</b> ravine. When the prisoners reached the previously prepared execution site, they were shot and buried in a mass grave using a bulldozer. After 15â€“20 minutes, the truck would return empty {{to pick up the}} next group. The final group of prisoners was executed just outside the farm building itself. By 22:00 that evening, all of the prisoners had been killed. Most sources place the number of victims at around 260. This figure has been used by ICTY prosecutors. Some estimates of the death toll go as high as 264. The Croatian authorities believe that the total figure stands at 261. The massacre was the most severe individual war crime committed in Europe since World War II until that point.|$|E
5|$|Green-flowered helleborine {{is found}} {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in <b>a</b> <b>wooded</b> area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods. lady orchid was {{discovered}} here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley {{on the west side of}} the Gorge; there is some doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. fly orchid and bee orchid are found in the gorge, along with their hybrid. A single plant of lesser meadow-rue is present in the gorge. Bristol rock-cress occurs here, and at nearby Penpole Point; in the gorge, there are about 3,000 plants on the Bristol side, and about 2,000 below Leigh Woods. Hutchinsia is found on both sides of the gorge. Bloody crane's-bill grows on the Bristol side of the gorge, where it is believed to be native. Little robin occurs on both sides of the gorge. Spiked speedwell grows on both sides of the gorge: the first British record of this plant was from the gorge, in 1641.|$|E
5|$|In Mansfield Township, {{the road}} {{passes through the}} {{residential}} community of Anderson and intersects County Route 632 (Anderson Road) and County Route 629 (Port Murray Road). From here, Route 57 turns northeast and parallels the Musconetcong River, heading through wooded areas around Upper Pohatcong Mountain with some farmland. In Stephensburg, the road passes through <b>a</b> <b>wooded</b> residential region and intersects County Route 652 (Watters Road). Past this intersection, the road continues alongside the wooded Musconetcong River, with residential and commercial development increasing past the Hazen Road intersection. Route 57 enters Hackettstown, where it becomes the Morris and Essex Turnpike before coming to its terminus at an intersection with the southern terminus of Route 182 and County Route 517, which continues south from this intersection as well as north along Route 182.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins in}} the guise of a comic book; FBI special agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{receives}} a letter from Shaineh Berkowitz (Pattie Tierce), a single mother who claims to have been mysteriously impregnated, while unconscious, by an unknown presence 18years ago, resulting in the birth of her son, Izzy (Stewart Gale). Now, following a similarly unexplained attack, she is pregnant again. She has heard about Mulder's expertise in the paranormal from The Jerry Springer Show and wants him to investigate. Mulder and his partner, special agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), travel to rural Albion, Indiana. They meet Shaineh and her son Izzy and learn that the description of the creature that attacked her, with a lumpy head and two mouths, is very similar to a comic book character invented by Izzy. His monstrous creation, called The Great Mutato, is inspired by a mysterious creature that has been seen by many of the locals. Izzy and his friends take the agents to <b>a</b> <b>wooded</b> area where they see Mutato (Chris Owens) from a distance.|$|E
5|$|The highway heads {{northeast}} into <b>a</b> <b>wooded</b> {{area from}} Sedona and follows Oak Creek as it enters Oak Creek Canyon. SR 89A then curves {{to the north}} as it follows the creek and provides access to Slide Rock State Park along {{this portion of the}} highway. The roadway leaves the creek as it begins to ascend through the canyon. Upon ascending, the road goes through a series of hairpin turns (no trucks over 50ft.) towards the Mogollon Rim. The roadway continues northward away from the canyon towards Flagstaff. It curves northeastward as it passes {{to the west of the}} Forest Highlands Golf Club. The route continues to the northeast towards I-17 near Flagstaff Pulliam Airport. SR 89A begins to run concurrently with I-17 as a freeway northward. The two highways continue north to an interchange with I-40, where I-17 terminates. The route continues north along Milton Road, passing to the west of Northern Arizona University before reaching its northern terminus at I-40 Business in Flagstaff.|$|E
5|$|The first {{long-lived}} supercell, which {{spawned the}} tornado with the longest continuous track of any single tornado to occur during this outbreak, developed around 4:50 pm CST (2250 UTC) southeast of Centerville in Yell County, Arkansas. The tornado touched {{down to the}} southwest of New Neely, causing minor damage to two structures and downing trees at EF0 to EF1 strength. The tornado tracked into Pope County, rapidly intensifying to EF3 strength as it slammed into Lucky Landing, a marina at Lake Atkins where multiple vehicles, boats, and mobile homes were destroyed, and one woman was killed. Continuing northeast, the tornado struck the southern and eastern edge of Atkins, killing three people. 65 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed, and 39 others were damaged {{to a lesser degree}} in the Atkins area. Several vehicles were blown off of Interstate 40, and six mobile homes were destroyed as well, with five others damaged. Northeast of Atkins, the tornado toppled metal truss towers, destroyed chicken houses, and heavily damaged a large church and gym. In the Happy Bend area, another fatality occurred as a man abandoned his mobile home and sought shelter in a large metal shipping container, which was tossed hundreds of yards into <b>a</b> <b>wooded</b> area. The tornado continued on and crossed into Conway County at EF3 intensity, passing near the town of Cleveland. 36 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 6 sustained major damage, and 8 sustained minor damage along this segment of the path. Several chicken houses were completely destroyed, killing 80,000 chickens, and an elderly couple was killed when their mobile home was swept completely away.|$|E

5|$|When the two generals {{with their}} men reached the pass, night had fallen, and the Paulicians, {{apparently}} unaware {{that they were}} being followed, had made camp in the valley of the pass. The Byzantines took up position in <b>a</b> <b>wooded</b> hill called Zogoloenos that overlooked the Paulician encampment, which further concealed them from their enemy. At this point, the sources record that a dispute broke out between the men of the two thematic corps as to who was the bravest; the two generals decided to take advantage of their troops' high morale and impetuousness to attack, despite their orders. A picked detachment of 600 men from both divisions launched a surprise attack at dawn, {{while the rest of the}} army remained behind and made loud clamour with trumpets and drums, so as to suggest the imminent arrival of the entire Byzantine field army under Christopher. The ruse worked perfectly: the Paulicians, taken by surprise, panicked and dispersed without offering any serious resistance. The Paulician rout was completed as they fell upon the main Byzantine army while fleeing. Their remnants were pursued by the victorious Byzantines up to a distance of 50km. Chrysocheir himself managed to escape with a small detachment of bodyguards, but he was brought at bay at Konstantinou Bounos (probably modern Yildiz DagÄ±). In the ensuing engagement, he was wounded by Poulades, a Byzantine soldier who had been formerly a captive of the Paulicians, and fell from his horse. He was then captured and beheaded by the advancing Byzantines, and his head was sent to Emperor Basil in Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|If {{travelling}} in a North-South direction, the Wicklow Way {{begins in}} Marlay Park, a historic demesne {{on the outskirts}} of Dublin's suburbs laid out in the late 18th century by the La Touches, a family of Huguenot merchants and bankers, and later developed as a public park. The trailhead comprises a map board, beside which is a low wall with a stone stile through which walkers pass in order to make their first step on the trail. The Way traverses the park, following <b>a</b> <b>wooded</b> shelterbelt along the Little Dargle River, before emerging on the southern side of the park onto College Road. Passing under the M50 motorway, it ascends Kilmashogue Lane and enters the forest recreation area on Kilmashogue mountain. This is the first of many forest plantations, owned by Coillte, that the Wicklow Way passes through. The tree species in this area comprise Sitka spruce, Scots pine and beech. Much of this initial section of the Way is underlain by granite. The trail circles the mountain, emerging onto open moorland near Fairy Castle. This upland heath and bog habitat is dominated by heather, purple moor grass and bog cotton and supports many bird species, including red grouse, meadow pipit and skylark. The Way crosses a saddle between Two Rock mountain and Kilmashogue before descending from a broad ridge between Two Rock and Tibradden Mountain into the valley of Glencullen where it follows the R116 road to the hamlet of Boranaraltry. The road is flanked by hedgerow-bordered farmland. Ascending from Boranaraltry, the trail crests the shoulder of Prince Williamâ€™s Seat, at which point the Way leaves County Dublin and enters County Wicklow. The habitat here alternates between blanket bog and upland heath. The trail descends {{to the floor of the}} Glencree valley via Curtlestown Wood where it then enters Lackan Wood and crosses the shoulder of Knockree Hill.|$|E
