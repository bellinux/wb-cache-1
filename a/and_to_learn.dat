As more missionaries were recruited for the mission, the burden of administrator increased. Riis and another Basel missionary, Simon Suss was forced by the situation to trade and barter {{in order to get}} money to buy food and other needs of his expanding mission staff and local workers. The missionaries faced many difficulties and one of the many charges leveled against them by detractors was that they had become commercial traders instead of church missionaries. Riis and his men started evangelizing to the rural people around Akropong, so the Basel Mission became colloquially known as “rural or bush” church. Riis wanted to tackle paganism inland <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the Akan language spoken more widely in the Gold Coast.

25|$|Islamic {{tradition}} relates that Muhammad {{received his}} first revelation in the Cave of Hira {{during one of}} his isolated retreats to the mountains. Thereafter, he received revelations over a period of 23 years. According to hadith and Muslim history, after Muhammad immigrated to Medina and formed an independent Muslim community, he ordered many of his companions to recite the Quran <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> and teach the laws, which were revealed daily. It is related that some of the Quraysh who were taken prisoners at the battle of Badr regained their freedom after they had taught some of the Muslims the simple writing of the time. Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate. As it was initially spoken, the Quran was recorded on tablets, bones, and the wide, flat ends of date palm fronds. Most suras were in use amongst early Muslims since they are mentioned in numerous sayings by both Sunni and Shia sources, relating Muhammad's use of the Quran as a call to Islam, the making of prayer and the manner of recitation. However, the Quran did not exist in book form at the time of Muhammad's death in 632. There is agreement among scholars that Muhammad himself did not write down the revelation.|$|E
