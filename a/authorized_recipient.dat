50|$|In cryptography, {{encryption}} is {{the process}} of encoding a message or information {{in such a way that}} only authorized parties can access it. Encryption does not itself prevent interference, but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor. In an encryption scheme, the intended information or message, referred to as plaintext, is encrypted using an encryption algorithm, generating ciphertext that can only be read if decrypted. For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an algorithm. It is in principle possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key, but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required. An <b>authorized</b> <b>recipient</b> can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- A new {{scheme for}} {{generating}} watermarks {{on the basis}} of the Vilenkin-Chrestenson functions is proposed. The scheme allows to generate the watermarks with an irregular structure in a given frequency domain. The parameters of the watermarks may be chosen so as to maximize the robustness of the watermarking scheme against such dangerous attacks as JPEG compression, low pass filtering and cropping. The proposed scheme for generating watermarks vary from the existing methods reported in the literature. We have performed a series of experiments to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Simulation results show their robustness for surviving intentional attacks and, hence, their effectiveness in protecting copyrights. Keywords: Vilenkin-Chrestenson functions, watermark generating, attacks Digital watermarks have been proposed as a method for discouraging illicit copyright and description of copyright material.

40|$|The growing {{gap between}} data and users calls for {{innovative}} tools {{that address the}} challenges faced by big data volume, velocity and variety. Along with these standard three V's of big data, an emerging fourth "V" is veracity, which addresses the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data. Traditional cryptographic techniques that ensure the veracity of data can have overheads that are too large to apply to big data. This work introduces a new technique called Computing on Masked Data (CMD), which improves data veracity by allowing computations to be performed directly on masked data and ensuring that only <b>authorized</b> <b>recipients</b> can unmask the data. Using the sparse linear algebra of associative arrays, CMD can be performed with significantly less overhead than other approaches while still supporting {{a wide range of}} linear algebraic operations on the masked data. Databases with strong support of sparse operations, such as SciDB or Apache Accumulo, are ideally suited to this technique. Examples are shown for the application of CMD to a complex DNA matching algorithm and to database operations over social media data.

Changing the information to some unidentifiable form, can save it from assailants. For example, plain text can be coded using schemes so that a stranger cannot apprehend it. Cryptography is a subject or field which deals with the secret transmission of messages / data between two parties. Cryptography is the practice and study of hiding information.

40|$|Leakage of a {{document}} distributed among {{a set of}} <b>authorized</b> <b>recipients</b> may result in violation of copyright or secrecy of {{a document}}. A hidden serial number in the document {{can be used for}} finding the source of the leak. A coalition attack is collusion of a set of users to generate copies of the document with a serial number (now called fingerprint) that is different from their original ones. To trace such a forged fingerprint back to one of its producers, reasonable assumptions are necessary. The marking assumption is one such assumption. It says if the i-th bits of the fingerprints of all colluders are the same, it will have the same value in the forged copy. Our first result in this thesis is a construction that achieves the highest known rate of fingerprinting codes, which we conjecture to be optimal. This construction combines two ideas from two earlier constructions. We use bias based code generation that was introduced by Tardos for his well-known fingerprinting code. Our accusation algorithm is based on an earlier algorithm by Anthapadmanabhan, Barg and Dumer that uses the information theoretic notion of typicality. The drawback of this construction is its slow accusation algorithm. Building upon our first construction, we construct another fingerprinting code in which the distributor may choose to have a faster accusation algorithm by sacrificing a little of the rate. A different accusation algorithm for our first code allows us to generalize it to a family of codes that show a tradeoff between rate and efficiency. This tradeoff suggests new ways to construct more efficient algorithms without losing the rate. For the case of two pirates this tradeoff can be made simpler by using Hamming distance instead of a mutual information. This allows improving quadratic running time of our first accusation algorithm to linear without lowering the rate at all. We also look at weak fingerprinting, a variant of fingerprinting for which the capacity is known. We construct a capacity-achieving weak fingerprinting code...|$|R
40|$|While student privacy {{has been}} a public issue for half a century, its {{contours}} change in response to social norms, technological capabilities, and political ideologies. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) seeks to prevent inaccurate or inappropriate information about students from being incorporated into pedagogical, academic, and employment decisionmaking. It does so by con- trolling who can access education records and, broadly, for what purposes. New education technologies take advantage of cloud computing and big data analytics to collect and share an unprecedented amount of information about students in class- rooms. Schools rely on outside, often for-profit, entities to provide these innovative tools. With the shift from education records to student data systems, privacy protection through access control {{does not account for}} the possibility that <b>authorized</b> <b>recipients,</b> or even educators themselves, might use student data for commercial or other non-educational purposes. Both FERPA and new state reforms rely on education purpose limitations as a compromise that allows schools to outsource data-reliant functions while addressing stake- holder concerns. However, current regulations define “education purposes” as information practices conducted on be- half of schools or pursuant to their authorization. Accordingly, they provide more procedural than substantive constraints. As with student privacy protections based on controlling access to education records, modern technological affordances limit the protection provided by education purpose limitations. Data-driven education tools change the nature of student information, the structure and method of school decisionmaking, and the creation of academic credentials. Broad education purpose limitations provide limited protection under these circumstances because they (1) treat education and non-education purposes as binary and mutually exclusive; (2) presume data practices serving education purposes align with students’ academic interests; (3) overlook the ethical complications created by “beta” education; (4) neglect the pedagogical effects of computerized instructional tools; and (5) discount the impact of data-driven technology on education itself.
