5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{nature of}} this species means that juveniles can only acquire a territory by finding a vacant area or replacing a dead <b>adult.</b> <b>In</b> Europe, young birds almost always move to unoccupied habitat, but in the larger territories of Siberia most live within the breeding range of an adult pair.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of butterflies have a four-stage life cycle; egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis) and imago (<b>adult).</b> <b>In</b> the genera Colias, Erebia, Euchloe, and Parnassius, {{a small number of}} species are known that reproduce semi-parthenogenetically; when the female dies, a partially developed larva emerges from her abdomen.|$|E
50|$|Most {{older adults}} lose {{photopic}} spatial contrast sensitivity. <b>Adults</b> <b>in</b> their 70s require {{about three times}} more contrast to detect high spatial frequencies than <b>adults</b> <b>in</b> their 20s.|$|R
50|$|The Adult High School is an Ottawa-Carleton District School Board {{high school}} for <b>adults</b> <b>in</b> Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is the only regular high school entirely for <b>adults</b> <b>in</b> the {{province}} of Ontario. Current enrollment is some 1200 students.|$|R
50|$|More {{than one}} hundred people are {{studying}} Leonese <b>in</b> <b>adult</b> classes <b>in</b> 2008-2009. There are five levels for <b>adults</b> <b>in</b> the official courses developed by the Department for Leonese Culture of the Leonese City Council.|$|R
5|$|As a child, Tolkien was {{bitten by}} a large baboon spider in the garden, an event some think later echoed in his stories, {{although}} he admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an <b>adult.</b> <b>In</b> another incident, a young family servant, who thought Tolkien a beautiful child, took the baby to his kraal to show him off, returning him the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Asbel is {{the eldest}} son and {{successor}} to Aston Lhant, the Lord of the village Lhant. After Sophie's death and Hubert's adoption into the Oswell family, Asbel leaves for Barona where he trains to be a knight in order to atone for his failure to protect Sophie. After the events of Tales of Graces, he assumes the position as Lord. In Lineage and Legacies, he marries Cheria and adopts Sophie into the Lhant family. He is voiced by Yuki Kaida {{as a child and}} Takahiro Sakurai as an <b>adult.</b> <b>In</b> the English dub, Kate Higgins voices him as a child and Bryce Papenbrook as an adult. Since his debut, Asbel has ranked third in the Tales character popularity polls.|$|E
5|$|Fleas are {{holometabolous}} insects, {{going through}} the four lifecycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (<b>adult).</b> <b>In</b> most species, neither female nor male fleas are fully mature when they first emerge but must feed on blood before they become capable of reproduction. The first blood meal triggers the maturation of the ovaries in females and {{the dissolution of the}} testicular plug in males, and copulation soon follows. Some species breed all year round while others synchronise their activities with their hosts' life cycles or with local environmental factors and climatic conditions. Flea populations consist of roughly 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.|$|E

50|$|In 1980, Fuyu Girgis was {{spoken by}} a {{majority}} of <b>adults</b> <b>in</b> a community of around a hundred homes. However, many <b>adults</b> <b>in</b> the area have switched to speaking a local variety of Mongolian, and children have switched to Chinese as taught in the education system.|$|R
25|$|Some {{species can}} overwinter as <b>adults</b> <b>in</b> diapause.|$|R
5|$|Hubert is Asbel's younger brother. He is fostered {{into the}} Oswell family to secure Asbel's {{succession}} to Lord. Hubert resents Asbel for deserting Lhant, perceiving the act as spiting his sacrifice, {{and his parents}} for abandoning him. He overcomes his anger when he reunites with his family seven years later. Due to his capabilities, he is appointed the lieutenant of the Strahta military. He is voiced by Mikako Takahashi {{as a child and}} Takahiro Mizushima as an <b>adult.</b> <b>In</b> the English dub, he is voiced by Steve Staley. Hubert ranked on the fifth Tales character popularity poll and fell from the rankings afterwards. He makes a cameo in Tales of Hearts R dressed as the Sony mascot Kuro.|$|E
5|$|Lyla Garrity becomes {{increasingly}} {{involved in an}} organization for young Christians. As part of a religious outreach program, she befriends a young convict, Santiago Herrera, who is released from juvenile detention shortly after they first meet. She gets him a job at her father Buddy's car dealership. Buddy encourages Santiago {{to try out for}} football after noticing his superior speed and coordination. When Taylor expresses interest in the boy, it is discovered that his legal guardian has left town and he has no <b>adult</b> <b>in</b> his life. Buddy agrees to take legal responsibility for him.|$|E
5|$|Severe C. maculatus, infestations {{can affect}} 100% of the stored peas and cause up to 60% grain loss {{within a few}} months. The weevil {{generally}} enters the cowpea pod through holes pre-harvest and lays eggs on the dry seed. The larvae burrow {{their way into the}} seed, feeding on the endosperm. The weevil develops into a sexually mature adult within the seed. An individual bruchid will lay 20â€“40 eggs, and in optimal conditions each egg can develop into a reproductively active <b>adult</b> <b>in</b> 3 weeks. The most common methods of protection involve the use of insecticides, the main pesticides used being carbomates, synthetic pyrethoids and organophosphates.|$|E

5|$|The {{juvenile}} {{resembles the}} <b>adult</b> <b>in</b> plumage, but the areas {{corresponding to the}} adult black feathers are browner and less glossy. The scapulars, wing and upper tail coverts have pale tips. The legs, bill and bare skin around the eyes are greyish green. It could possibly {{be confused with the}} juvenile yellow-billed stork, but the latter has paler wings and mantle, a longer bill and white under the wings.|$|E
5|$|The orally {{lethal dose}} in humans has been {{reported}} as approximately 1.4 mL/kg of pure ethylene glycol. That is approximately 224 mL (7.6 oz.) of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80kg adult and 56 mL (2 oz.) for a 20kg child. Although survival with medical treatment has occurred with doses much higher than this, death has occurred with 30 mL of the concentrate in an <b>adult.</b> <b>In</b> the EU classification of dangerous substances it is 'harmful' (Xn) while more toxic substances are classified as 'toxic' (T) or 'very toxic' (T+). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency generally puts substances which are lethal at more than 30 g to adults in Toxicity Class III.|$|E
5|$|The ringed caecilian (Siphonops annulatus) has {{developed}} a unique adaptation {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the <b>adult</b> <b>in</b> a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy. The brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate. Meanwhile, they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca.|$|E

5|$|Whilst the {{government}} is eager to implement the changes, many oppose the proposal, some on civil liberties grounds. Compulsory school attendance is usually justified by reference to the argument that minors are incapable of making sufficiently reasoned choices. However, the 16-18 age group falls into a grey area, being regarded as effectively <b>adult</b> <b>in</b> a number of contexts. Indeed, in some jurisdictions (e.g. Scotland), individuals are considered to reach full maturity at 16.|$|E
5|$|Wolf and coyote {{packs and}} the solitary cougar {{are the most}} likely predators, {{although}} brown and black bears also prey on elk. Coyote packs mostly prey on elk calves, though they can sometimes take a winter-weakened <b>adult.</b> <b>In</b> the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem which includes Yellowstone National Park, bears are the most significant predators of calves. Major predators in Asia include the wolf, dhole, brown bear, Siberian tiger, Amur leopard, and snow leopard. Eurasian lynx and wild boar sometimes prey on Asian elk calves. Historically, tigers in the Lake Baikal region fed on Manchurian wapiti, and continue {{to do so in the}} Amur region.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{kind and}} caring to others {{no matter what}} their circumstances, as {{depicted}} in the television series. In an early episode, Ariel helps an orphaned merboy who had fallen in with a bad crowd. In another episode, Ariel befriends a supposed bad luck creature and protects it from Ursula and other merfolk who wish it harm. Ariel appears as an <b>adult</b> <b>in</b> Return to the Sea and gives birth to a daughter named Melody, becoming the first, and currently, only, Disney princess to become a mother. Ariel is protective of her daughter, as Triton was of Ariel in the first film. After Morgana threatens Ariel and King Triton, Prince Eric and Ariel build a wall around the palace to protect Melody from Morgana and other terrors of the ocean. Although it protected her, it could not protect her curiosity. Ariel's Beginning depicts her personality {{as it was in the}} original film after Jodi Benson had advocated returning the character to her roots. Ariel is once again rebellious, and after her father decrees music to be banned in Atlantica she runs away with Sebastian and his band.|$|E

5|$|Diptera {{go through}} a {{complete}} metamorphosis with four distinct life stages â€“ egg, larva, pupa and <b>adult.</b> <b>In</b> many flies, the larval stage is long and adults may have a short life. Most dipteran larvae develop in protected environments; many are aquatic and others are found in moist places such as carrion, fruit, vegetable matter, fungi and, {{in the case of}} parasitic species, inside their hosts. They tend to have thin cuticles and become desiccated if exposed to the air. Apart from the Brachycera, most dipteran larvae have sclerotinised head capsules, which may be reduced to remnant mouth hooks; the Brachycera, however, have soft, gelatinized head capsules from which the sclerites are reduced or missing. Many of these larvae retract their heads into their thorax.|$|E
5|$|John's first {{marriage}} probably dates to {{after his arrival}} in Serbia, though the identity of his first wife, if any, is unknown. If the next ruler of Valona, Alexander Komnenos Asen, was his son, {{then he would have}} been born circa 1346â€“1348, as he was already an <b>adult</b> <b>in</b> 1363â€“1366. This would place John's potential {{first marriage}} a few years before Alexander's estimated birth. Around 1350â€“1355, John married Anna Palaiologina, a granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and a widow of John II Orsini, the despot of Epirus. This marriage to an Epirote noblewoman consolidated and legitimised John's position in the region. Besides Alexander, another very likely child of John Komnenos Asen was a certain Komnena, the wife of BalÅ¡a II who had succeeded Alexander as ruler of Valona in early 1372.|$|E
5|$|Monroe {{was born}} Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926 {{as the third}} child of Gladys Pearl Baker (nÃ©e Monroe, 1902â€“1984). Gladys, the {{daughter}} of two poor Midwestern migrants to California, was a flapper {{and worked as a}} film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. When she was fifteen, Gladys married a man nine years her senior, John Newton Baker, and had two children by him, Robert (1917â€“1933) and Berniece (born 1919). She filed for divorce in 1921, and Baker took the children with him to his native Kentucky. Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was twelve, and met {{her for the first time}} as an <b>adult.</b> <b>In</b> 1924, Gladys married her second husbandâ€”Martin Edward Mortensenâ€”but they separated before she became pregnant with Monroe by a different man; they divorced in 1928. The identity of Monroe's father is unknown and Baker was most often used as her surname.|$|E
