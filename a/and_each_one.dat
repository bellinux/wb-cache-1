5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Dearly Stars {{is similar}} to previous games in the series, but with new elements and differences to the minigames. The gameplay was adjusted to allow the player the option to quickly play through the game's story, but head director Toshihiko Kujioka also wanted to add in gameplay elements that would add another layer of challenge. The story is told {{from the perspective of}} Ai Hidaka, Eri Mizutani and Ryō Akizuki—three prospective pop idols introduced in Dearly Stars as they enter the talent agency 876 Production, and deals with their training on their way to stardom. The player has access to the three idols' different scenarios when playing, <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>one</b> involves a branching plot line.|$|E
5|$|Alyssa {{is given}} no {{weaponry}} during {{the majority of}} the game, other than a limited supply of holy water, which can be used to temporarily stun pursuing Subordinates. Within each level, the Subordinate can appear in any location after a set period of time, but also randomly or if Alyssa makes noise. They also appear in certain set locations. When one appears, it immediately begins to chase Alyssa, attempting to kill her. The player must either hide from or evade it. Evasion can only be accomplished in certain places, and each evasion point can only be used once. Using an evasion point does not kill the Subordinate, but instead renders them unconscious for a set time. The primary means of eluding one, however, is by hiding. There are multiple hiding points throughout each level, <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>one</b> can be used multiple times. However, hiding places are ineffective if the Subordinate sees Alyssa enter them.|$|E

Limekilns and Hitchin Hill Ground are quieter camping areas, whereas Pennard Hill Ground is a lively campsite. Cockmill Meadow is a family campsite and Wicket Ground was introduced in 2011 as a second family-only campsite. A disabled campsite is also available in Spring Ground. Campsite accommodation is provided in the cost of a standard entry ticket but festival-goers must bring their own tents. Tipis have been at the festival for many years. A limited number of fixed tipis are available for hire at the tipi field near the stone circle. Up to six adults can stay in each tipi <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>one</b> comes with a groundsheet and raincatcher. Internal bedding and camping equipment is not provided. Tipi Park also offers solar showers and a log-fired yurt sauna to cap off the experience.|$|E

5|$|The story, told {{through the}} use of voiced and {{animated}} comic panels, centers on Angel, a heroine in a post-apocalyptic United States that travels from town to town protecting helpless survivors of the war from attacking gangs. Angel defends the towns using Gypsy, the name given to her armored car equipped with mounted machine guns. The game uses an overhead view as the player speeds around a small town using Gypsy's machine guns to repel enemy gangs known as Wastelanders. There are three types of Wastelanders <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>one</b> unleashes attacks in a different manner: The Slavers class will attempt to capture the townspeople, Killers will only attack the player, and Duals can take on either the role of attacking or capturing during a raid. When enemies are killed, they leave behind weapons for the player such as napalm, land mines, or Electromagnetic pulse bombs (EMPs); or they drop upgrades which improve the car's weapons or armor. The EMPs are used to temporarily disable all the enemies on the screen while the napalm and land mines can be set between waves as traps for unsuspecting Wastelanders. One weapon upgrade offers players incendiary ammunition for the car's machine guns which makes it easier to destroy enemies by lighting them on fire.|$|E

25|$|DNA is {{synthesised}} from 5' to 3', so when copying the 3' to 5' strand, replication is continuous. Phosphodiester links form {{between the}} 3' to 5' and nucleotides {{can be added}} {{with the aid of}} the enzyme DNA polymerase for the continuous leading strand. However, in order to synthesise the lagging strand (the 5' to 3' strand) synthesis must occur in small sections (100-200 nucleotides at a time in eukaryotes). These new stretches of DNA are called Okazaki fragments <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>one</b> requires its own RNA primer.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to study demographics of patients with cystic echinococcosis in East Azerbaijan; as well as to repot the sites of involvements. In this cross-sectional study, 318 patients with surgical and nonsurgical cystic echinococcosis were recruited from three referral centers in Tabriz within a 10 -year period of time. The patients’ demographics (age and gender) and the site of infection were investigated. Among the patients, females were predominant (57. 5 vs. 42. 5 %). The mean age of patients was 32. 59 ± 18. 47 (range: 70 years (2. 5 %). The lung was the most frequently infected organ (48. 1 %), followed by the liver (28. 9 %), gallbladder (3. 5 %), spleen <b>and</b> kidney (<b>each</b> <b>one</b> in 2. 2 %), abdomen, intestine, pleura, bronchus <b>and</b> mediastinum (<b>each</b> <b>one</b> in 1. 6 %), chest wall <b>and</b> heart (<b>each</b> <b>one</b> in 1. 3 %), brain, pericardium, facial sinus, pancreas <b>and</b> esophagus (<b>each</b> <b>one</b> in 0. 6 %) and the ovary, uterus, axillary region, pelvis <b>and</b> femur (<b>each</b> <b>one</b> in 0. 3 %). In conclusion, this study showed that the patients with hydatid cysts in East Azerbaijan Province are mainly females in the age group of 20 - 40 years.

25|$|Bookbinding is a {{specialized}} trade {{that relies on}} basic operations of measuring, cutting, and gluing.

All operations have a specific order <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>one</b> relies on accurate completion of the previous step with little room for back tracking. An extremely durable binding can be achieved by using the best hand techniques and finest materials when compared to a common publisher's binding that falls apart after normal use.|$|E
