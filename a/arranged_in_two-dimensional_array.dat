Clinical experiments have confirmed that electrical stimulation {{can be used to}} duplicate the action of photoreceptors in the retina to provide vision to blind patients suffering from RP/AMD. The retinal prosthesis system consists of an intraocular unit implanted inside the eye and a separate extraocular unit. The micro-stimulator involved in retinal prosthesis consists of multiple electrodes <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>array</b> and {{is a part of the}} intraocular unit. The micro-stimulator needs data and power to be transferred wirelessly from the extraocular unit. The power link consists of a highly efficient Class-E driver that transfers power inductively to the intraocular unit. A Class-E power driver is developed to suit the requirements and has been analyzed. The effect of the loaded Q variations on the Class-E circuit has been studied. Back-telemetry from the intraocular unit is necessary and is achieved through load modulation in the intraocular unit. A novel variation of PWM encoding has been conceived and employed to combine data and clock. The data detection unit consisting o...|$|E

Neglecting retardation our formalism allows factoring the geometrical properties from the properties of the materials. If the conducting phase is continuous the low frequency behavior is metallic. If the conducting paths are nearly bloqued by the dielectric particles, the high frequency behavior is dielectric. Thus, extraordinary-reflectance bands may develop at intermediate frequencies, where the macroscopic response matches vacuum. The optical properties of these systems may be tuned by adjusting the geometry.

The MWT technology is based on laser perforation and that the bus grid lines in the front surface of the solar cell are moved to the back surface. The effective area on the front surface increases and the conversion efficiency is improved. One of the most important processes in MWT technology is laser perforation and a new perforation scheme using <b>two-dimensional</b> laser <b>array</b> is designed.

40|$|We analyze surface codes, the topological quantum error-correcting codes {{introduced}} by Kitaev. In these codes, qubits are <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>array</b> on a surface of nontrivial topology, and encoded quantum operations {{are associated with}} nontrivial homology cycles of the surface. We formulate protocols for error recovery, and study the efficacy of these protocols. An order-disorder phase transition occurs in this system at a nonzero critical value of the error rate; if the error rate is below the critical value (the accuracy threshold), encoded information can be protected arbitrarily well {{in the limit of}} a large code block. This phase transition can be accurately modeled by a three-dimensional Z(2) lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We estimate the accuracy threshold, assuming that all quantum gates are local, that qubits can be measured rapidly, and that polynomial-size classical computations can be executed instantaneously. We also devise a robust recovery procedure that does not require measurement or fast classical processing; however, for this procedure the quantum gates are local only if the qubits are <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> four or more spatial dimensions. We discuss procedures for encoding, measurement, and performing fault-tolerant universal quantum computation with surface codes, and argue that these codes provide a promising framework for quantum computing architectures...|$|R

A microarray image is obtained by laser scanning a hybridized cDNA microarray, {{which consists of}} thousands of spots representing chains of cDNA sequences, <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>array.</b> The separation of the spots into distinct cells is widely known as microarray image gridding.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{application}} of sub-wavelength structured single layer reflectors in a Fabry-Perot-Interferometer (FPI) {{that are used in}} order to replace distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR). A pair of <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>arrays</b> of ring resonators was analyzed. A 100 nm thin Al layer is regularly patterned to form a meta-surface structure. It shows high reflectance in a sufficiently wide wavelength range. This design approach has the advantage that an optimization can be done by varying geometry parameters of lateral structures only. Moreover, the material is highly compatible to standard MEMS processes. The structures used here are rings that are <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>array.</b> Thus, parameters to be varied are the inner and the outer ring diameters and the array pitch. The optimum dimensions of the metal rings have been found iteratively. Samples were fabricated by structuring of two silicon wafers and subsequent wafer bonding. Deep dry etching of the reflecto r carriers from the back side in the areas of the resonator arrays results in free standing silicon nitride membranes that carry the resonators. The carrier membranes elastically suspend the reflecting ring resonators for variation of the cavity width. Finally, the substrates are assembled by a wafer bonding technique utilizing a SU- 8 polymer layer with a very definite thickness. A peak transmittance of 55 %, a bandwidth FWHM = 100 nm and a modulation contrast of M = 50 : 1 were achieved.

Area-based methods on the position of its projections {{on the left and}} right images. correspond brightness patterns in two images [14, 24]. The image plane of cameras that produces the images consists of discrete pixels. This discretization of images generates uncertainty in estimation of the depth at each 3 -D point. In this paper, we investigate the effect of vergence and spatially vary-ing resolution on the depth estimation error. First, vergence is studied when pairs of stereo images with uniform resolution are used. Then the problem is studied for a stereo system similar to that of humans, in which cameras have high resolution in These algorithms have several drawbacks which are pointed out in [12, 18]. Feature-based methods match fea-tures such as edges [3, 9, 11, 13, 15, 21], and linear edge segments [1, 23]. Finally, the depth of each point is obtained using triangulation.

We studied in particular the validity of extending the so-called “universal scaling law”, derived for a pair of particles in previous works, to a linear chain of any size consisting of silver nanospheres.

40|$|The {{effects of}} fluid {{viscoelasticity}} on {{the expansion of}} gas bubbles in polymer foams for both non-reactive and reactive polymers are investigated. Polymer foams are used extensively in consumer products, from car parts to upholstery. They are produced either by injection moulding (of non-reactive polymeric fluids) or reaction injection moulding. We use standard rheological models (Oldroyd B and Pompom) to investigate bubble growth driven by gas diffusion {{as a model for}} injection moulding. To model reaction injection moulding, we develop a new fluid model based on existing linear theory for a gelling liquid. In this case gas is produced as a by-product of the polymer reaction. At small bubble volume fractions gas bubbles remain spherical and isolated from neighbouring bubbles during expansion. In this regime we demonstrate the effects of rheology and gelation on the bubble growth. At high bubble volume fractions neighbouring bubbles compete for the available gas and become distorted in shape. The effects of viscoelasticity on the expansion of gas bubbles <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> a <b>two-dimensional</b> hexagonal <b>array</b> <b>in</b> a non-reacting polymeric fluid are investigated. In addition to a full finite element calculation of the two-dimensional flow, two one-dimensional approximations valid in the limits of small and large gas area fractions are presented. We show that these approximations give accurate predictions of the evolution of the bubble area, but give less accurate predictions of the bubble shape. Finally we consider how bubbles of different sizes evolve in an expanding foam. We illustrate how the surface tension driven phenomenon known as Ostwald Ripening causes large bubbles to grow at the expense of smaller ones. For the case of bubbles of two different sizes we examine the effects of viscoelasticity on the shapes of the bubbles within the structure and show that viscoelasticity has a different effect on the bubble size distribution depending upon the initial geometry.
