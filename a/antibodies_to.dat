5|$|Antibodies are glycoproteins {{belonging}} to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may {{be attached to the}} antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> be grouped into five isotypes. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region. The ability of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. For example, IgE is responsible for an allergic response consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release. IgE's Fab paratope binds to allergic antigen, for example house dust mite particles, while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.|$|E
5|$|<b>Antibodies</b> <b>to</b> {{certain types}} of {{chromatin}} organization, in particular, nucleosomes, {{have been associated with}} a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction. As in the case of progeria, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.|$|E
5|$|Dengue {{is spread}} by {{several species of}} {{mosquito}} of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type {{increases the risk of}} severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> the virus or its RNA.|$|E
40|$|Eighteen {{paired serum samples}} {{submitted}} for serodiagnosis of current infection showed anomalous antibody results by complement fixation test when tested with a battery of agents (viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and chlamydia) selected for testing {{on the basis of}} the symptoms of the patient. Seventeen serum pairs showed a fourfold or greater rise in titer of <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> two agents in the battery, and one showed only a twofold rise in titer of <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> the identified causative agent but an eightfold rise in titer of <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> a heterologous agent. The 18 serum pairs were tested for IgM <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> the two involved agents to determine whether IgM antibody tests would better distinguish the probable cause of the current infection. The serum pairs were separated into three groups based on their IgM responses. Group I consisted of six serum pairs with IgM <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> both agents, four pairs of which showed a fourfold or greater rise in titer of IgM <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> both agents, and two of which showed a rise in titer of IgM <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> only one of the two agents.

Group III consisted of two serum pairs with no IgM <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> either agent. Results show that determination of presence or absence of IgM antibody per se or demonstration of a fourfold or greater rise in specific IgM antibody titer does not always help in distinguishing the causative agent in current infections...|$|R

5|$|Other {{methods for}} elucidating the {{cellular}} location of proteins requires {{the use of}} known compartmental markers for regions such as the ER, the Golgi, lysosomes or vacuoles, mitochondria, chloroplasts, plasma membrane, etc. With the use of fluorescently tagged versions of these markers or of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> known markers, it becomes much simpler to identify the localization of a protein of interest. For example, indirect immunofluorescence will allow for fluorescence colocalization and demonstration of location. Fluorescent dyes are used to label cellular compartments for a similar purpose.|$|E
5|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} testing a specific integrin, alpha-six-beta-one, and the role it plays in the RMS. The study researched the principle that chemoattractive molecules may {{play an important role}} in neuroblast migration in the RMS. The study of this one particular integrin was conducted in mice. By using <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> bind to α6β1 integrin subunits, found on the neuroblasts, the researchers observed that the migration was disrupted. Furthermore, they investigated the mechanism through which α6β1 integrin functions and determined it was via the chemoattractant laminin. This was completed by injecting laminin perpendicular to the RMS and observing that doing so drew “neuroblasts away from their normal course of migration”. The researchers concluded with the idea that this research could prove useful for therapeutics purposes in that neuroblasts could potentially be drawn to locations of injury or disease.|$|E
5|$|Because {{molecular}} diagnostics {{methods can}} detect sensitive markers, these tests are less intrusive than a traditional biopsy. For example, because cell-free nucleic acids exist in human plasma, a simple blood sample can {{be enough to}} sample genetic information from tumours, transplants or an unborn fetus. Many, but not all, molecular diagnostics methods based on nucleic acids detection use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to vastly {{increase the number of}} nucleic acid molecules, thereby amplifying the target sequence(s) in the patient sample. The detection of the marker might use real time PCR, direct sequencing, or microarray chipsprefabricated chips that test many markers at once. The same principle applies to the proteome and the genome. High-throughput protein arrays can use complementary DNA or <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> bind and hence can detect many different proteins in parallel.|$|E
40|$|One hundred six urine {{specimens}} from 26 {{patients with}} acute and chronic pyelonephritis and cystitis were tested by radioimmunoassay to determine (1) whether <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> nor-mal human kidney antigen was present and (2) whether {{the presence or}} absence of this antibody correlated quantitatively with <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> the patient's own infecting organism.

40|$|The efficacies of nine {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assays (EIA) for <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> {{human immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) and one EIA for <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> HIV- 2 in detecting <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> HIV- 2 were studied. The competitive EIAs for <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> HIV- 1 were less sensitive than the indirect EIAs. The overall prevalence of positive results was between 28 and 51 % with the competitive EIAs and between 70 and 93 % with the indirect EIAs. Most of the EIAs were less sensitive in detecting <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> HIV- 2 in sera from people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-like diseases than in sera from symptomless individuals. The results indicate {{that there is a}} high degree of cross-reactivity between HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 by EIA, indicating that serotype specificity must be determined by Western blot (immunoblot) with both sets of viral antigens.

5|$|HIV-1 {{testing is}} {{initially}} by an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) to detect <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate. If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.|$|E
5|$|This {{serves to}} {{increase}} {{the diversity of the}} antibody pool and impacts the antibody's antigen-binding affinity. Some point mutations will result in the production of antibodies that have a weaker interaction (low affinity) with their antigen than the original antibody, and some mutations will generate antibodies with a stronger interaction (high affinity). B cells that express high affinity antibodies on their surface will receive a strong survival signal during interactions with other cells, whereas those with low affinity antibodies will not, and will die by apoptosis. Thus, B cells expressing antibodies with a higher affinity for the antigen will outcompete those with weaker affinities for function and survival allowing the average affinity of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> increase over time. The process of generating antibodies with increased binding affinities is called affinity maturation. Affinity maturation occurs in mature B cells after V(D)J recombination, and is dependent on help from helper T cells.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen. Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for childhood asthma, and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an occupational disease of laboratory animal technicians and scientists. One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> Ratn1.|$|E
40|$|The anticomplement {{immunofluorescence}} (ACIF) {{test was}} compared with complement fixation and fluorescent <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> membrane antigen {{procedures for the}} detection of <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> varicella-zoster virus.
