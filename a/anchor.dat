40|$|A {{limitation}} {{in research}} on bolt <b>anchoring</b> is the unknown relationship between dynamic perturbation and mechanical characteristics. This paper divides dynamic impulse loads into engineering loads and blasting loads and then employs numerical calculation software FLAC 3 D to analyze the stability of an <b>anchoring</b> system perturbed by an impulse load. The evolution of the dynamic response of the axial force/shear stress in the <b>anchoring</b> system is thus obtained. It is revealed that the corners and middle of the <b>anchoring</b> system are strongly affected by the dynamic load, and the dynamic response of shear stress is distinctly stronger {{than that of the}} axial force in the <b>anchoring</b> system. Additionally, the perturbation of the impulse load reduces stress in the <b>anchored</b> rock mass and induces repeated tension and loosening of the rods in the <b>anchoring</b> system, thus reducing the stability of the <b>anchoring</b> system. The oscillation amplitude of the axial force in the <b>anchored</b> segment is mitigated far more than that in the free segment, demonstrating that extended/full-length <b>anchoring</b> is extremely stable and surpasses simple <b>anchors</b> with free ends...|$|R
5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} line used by scuba divers {{to fasten}} {{themselves}} to something. The original purpose was to fasten a diver to a shot line during decompression stops in current. The line is typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip at each end. One clip is fastened to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used to fasten the line to the <b>anchor</b> line. In current this relieves the diver from holding on to the <b>anchor</b> line during the decompression stop.|$|E

5|$|As Caroline neared Batavia, Phoenix {{entered the}} well-defended harbour, making further pursuit impossible. However, Rainier then sighted a second frigate, lying at <b>anchor</b> in Batavia Roads, {{accompanied}} {{only by the}} 14-gun corvette William, the elusive brig Zee-Ploeg, and the 18-gun ship Patriot {{that belonged to the}} Dutch East India Company. Prisoners from Zeerop identified this ship as the 36-gun Maria Riggersbergen under Captain Claas Jager. Although this force was significantly stronger than Caroline, and could call on the support of approximately 30 gunboats anchored closer inshore, Rainier immediately gave orders to advance on the Dutch frigate. In his preparations for battle, Rainier ordered that springs be placed on his <b>anchor</b> cables, giving his ship the ability to easily turn at <b>anchor</b> to face new threats once engaged with the Maria Riggersbergen.|$|E
30|$|For {{the hybrid}} TOA/RSS network, {{we assume that}} the agent is {{connected}} to different <b>anchors,</b> and these <b>anchors</b> are able to measure the range between the agent and <b>anchors</b> via TOA or RSS parameters.

5|$|At 20:45, with Jason {{far behind}} in the darkness, Mars hauled up and Hood {{attempted}} to manoeuvre into an effective position from which to attack the waiting Hercule. The vagaries of the current in the Raz de Sein passage prevented Hood from handling his ship effectively however and instead he resolved on bringing Mars directly alongside and fighting broadside to broadside. At 21:15 Mars was in range and L'Héritier opened fire, Hood replying immediately. For ten minutes, the masts and rigging of Mars came under fire, with damage to the bowsprit and foremast, as Hood continued to attempt to hold his firing position against the current before pulling slightly ahead of Hercule at 21:25 and dropping <b>anchor.</b> The port bow <b>anchor</b> became entangled with the starboard <b>anchor</b> on Hercule and the British ship was swung violently into the French ship, {{the force of the}} collision unhinging four of the gunports on Mars.|$|E

5|$|It {{was late}} on 1 August when the British fleet {{appeared}} in the bay, and the French were at <b>anchor</b> in a strong defensive position. The French commander, Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers, did not expect a night attack, but Nelson ordered his ships to form up and attack {{the head of the}} French van, taking advantage of a favourable wind which allowed his ships to drift down the line, while preventing the French rear from reinforcing the van and centre. Bellerophon was the eighth ship in the British line, and as the battle began, Darby turned her towards the French centre, eventually coming to <b>anchor</b> at 7 pm. Possibly due to some error {{on the part of the}} crew or because the <b>anchor</b> had dragged, Bellerophon came to rest alongside the French flagship, the 120-gun Orient.|$|E

The tests focused on expansion <b>anchors</b> and undercut <b>anchors</b> that are of interest by nuclear industries. Groups of four <b>anchors</b> were subjected to cyclic moments at a rate similar to that in an earthquake. The tests indicated that the cracks up to 0.25  mm [0.01 in.] did not affect the capacity of tested undercut <b>anchors</b> but caused larger displacements at failure. Meanwhile, the expansion <b>anchors</b> in cracks developed low capacity and in some cases the failure modes changed from concrete breakout (for <b>anchors</b> in uncracked concrete) to pull-out (for <b>anchors</b> in cracked concrete).|$|R

40|$|An {{attitudes and}} persuasion {{perspective}} can broaden {{our understanding of}} <b>anchoring</b> by highlighting sources of variability in <b>anchoring</b> effects that have been largely overlooked.

Single ply sheets with four <b>anchors</b> were able to develop up to 224  % higher load than the bonded companion specimens.
