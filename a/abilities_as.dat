5|$|Hoping to {{gain more}} control of Oscorp Industries, Osborn accuses Stromm of {{embezzlement}} and has his partner arrested. Searching his former mentor's possessions, Norman discovers an experimental strength/intelligence enhancement formula, but in attempting to create the serum, it turns green and explodes in his face. The accident greatly increases his intelligence and physical <b>abilities</b> <b>as</b> intended, but also has the side-effect of driving him into destructive insanity.|$|E

30|$|The primary {{message from}} our {{empirical}} exercise {{is that the}} use of a “cognitive <b>ability</b> measure” <b>as</b> an error-free independent variable in a wage regression can lead to quite different inferences than a more defensible approach (MESE) that treats cognitive <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> a latent construct. For example, for men the estimated portion of the black-white log wage gap that is “unexplained” once we control for ability is − 0.09 in our MESE model, which is more than one third smaller than the − 0.14 estimate we get when we use the ML estimate of cognitive <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> a regressor. Our estimate also differs substantially from the − 0.065 estimate that comes if we use the median PV of cognitive <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> a regressor.|$|R

The game includes some tactical role-playing elements, whereby the player's soldiers can gain new <b>abilities</b> <b>as</b> they survive more battles.|$|E

In 1987, Hillenburg left the Institute to pursue a career in animation.|$|E

5|$|The mythology {{surrounding}} Rommel {{has been}} the subject of analysis by both English- and German-speaking historians in recent decades. The reevaluation has produced new interpretations of Rommel, including his relationship with National Socialism, his <b>abilities</b> <b>as</b> operational and strategic level commander, and his role (if any) in the July 20th plot to assassinate Hitler. Historians and commentators conclude that Rommel remains an ambiguous figure, not easily definable either inside or outside the myth.|$|E
5|$|Burnside {{was offered}} {{command of the}} Army of the Potomac {{following}} Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's failure in the Peninsula Campaign. He refused this opportunity because of his loyalty to McClellan {{and the fact that}} he understood his own lack of military experience, and detached part of his corps in support of Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia in the Northern Virginia Campaign. He received telegrams at this time from Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter which were extremely critical of Pope's <b>abilities</b> <b>as</b> a commander, and he forwarded on to his superiors in concurrence. This episode later played a significant role in Porter's court-martial, in which Burnside appeared as a star witness.|$|E
5|$|Cannan relinquished his {{appointment}} as Quartermaster General on 31 December 1945 and {{retired as a}} major general the next day. He remained an honorary colonel until 8 June 1953.

He was Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in the South West Pacific from 1946 to 1947, of the Queensland division of the Australian Red Cross from 1950 to 1951, and of the Services Canteens Trust from 1948 to 1957. He was also a director of several companies. Survived by his wife Eileen, Cannan died on 23 May 1976. He became the last of Australia's Great War generals to pass away, and was cremated with full military honours.|$|E

5|$|Donkey Kong's kidnapped friends become playable {{characters}} {{after the}} player rescues them. Each {{of the five}} characters begin with basic abilities and receive additional, unique <b>abilities</b> <b>as</b> the game progresses, including abilities needed to solve some puzzles. For example, Donkey Kong can smash dirt for banana coins, Chunky Kong can lift rocks, Tiny Kong can crawl through holes, Diddy Kong can fly, and Lanky Kong can float. The characters are also unique in the projectiles they shoot and the musical instruments they play. For example, some doors can only be opened with Donkey Kong's coconut projectiles and others can only be opened with Diddy Kong's guitar. There are more special abilities than face buttons on the controller, so button combinations are needed to trigger some abilities.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of these}} {{positive}} outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification <b>abilities</b> <b>as</b> preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E
5|$|Early {{mediation}} {{attempts in}} March 1499 had failed because of mutual distrust between the parties. But {{after the battle}} of Dornach, the Swabian League was war-weary and had lost all confidence in the king's <b>abilities</b> <b>as</b> a military leader, and thus refused Maximilian's demands to muster a new army. The Swabian and Habsburg armies had suffered far higher human losses than the Swiss, and were also short on artillery, after repeatedly having lost their equipment to the Swiss. The Swiss also had no interest to prolong the war further, though they refused a first peace proposal that Maximilian presented at Schaffhausen in August 1499.|$|E

Ziff-Davis were not confident of Goldsmith's <b>abilities</b> <b>as</b> an editor, so when Fairman left, a consultant, Norman Lobsenz, was hired to work with her. She performed well, however, and Lobsenz's involvement soon became minimal.|$|E
5|$|Further {{neurological}} examinations {{are crucial}} in {{the differential diagnosis}} of AD and other diseases. Interviews with family members are also utilised {{in the assessment of}} the disease. Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living <b>abilities,</b> <b>as</b> well as on the decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay {{consists}} of racing in futuristic hovercrafts and using their speed-boosting abilities to navigate through the courses {{as quickly as}} possible in settings like the recurring Mute City, Big Blue and Port Town. The first game was labeled by critics as an influential video game that created the futuristic racing subgenre as well as inspired the creation of numerous racing games such as Daytona USA and the Wipeout series. The series casually centers around the F-Zero racer Captain Falcon and his talented racing and bounty hunting <b>abilities</b> <b>as</b> well as his encounters with the other F-Zero characters.|$|E
