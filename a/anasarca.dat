50|$|<b>Anasarca,</b> or extreme {{generalized}} edema, is {{a medical}} condition characterized by widespread swelling of the skin due to effusion of fluid into the extracellular space.|$|E
50|$|It {{can also}} be created from the {{administration}} of exogenous intravenous fluid. Certain plant-derived anticancer chemotherapeutic agents, such as docetaxel, cause <b>anasarca</b> through a poorly understood capillary leak syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Edema: Leakage {{of fluid}} into the tissues {{is a common}} and often severe problem. This may take several forms, {{including}} dependent peripheral edema, pulmonary edema, effusions such as pleural effusion or ascites, or generalized capillary leakage (<b>anasarca).</b>|$|E
50|$|Generalized swelling, or massive edema (also called <b>anasarca),</b> is {{a common}} sign in {{severely}} ill people. Although slight edema {{may be difficult to}} detect to the untrained eye, especially in an overweight person, massive edema is very obvious.|$|E
5000|$|Edema {{blisters}} (also {{known as}} [...] "Edema bulla", [...] "Hydrostatic bulla," [...] and [...] "Stasis blister") are a cutaneous condition that develop {{in patients with}} an acute exacerbation of chronic edema, particularly of the lower extremities, and {{in the setting of}} <b>anasarca.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} caused by liver failure (cirrhosis of the liver), renal failure/disease, right-sided heart failure, {{as well as}} severe malnutrition/protein deficiency. The {{increase}} in {{salt and water retention}} caused by low cardiac output can also result in <b>anasarca</b> as a long term maladaptive response.|$|E

The degree to which this occurs can vary between slight edema in the eyelids that decreases during the day, to affecting the lower limbs, to generalized swelling, to full blown <b>anasarca.</b>|$|E
50|$|Causes of edema {{which are}} {{generalized}} {{to the whole}} body can cause edema in multiple organs and peripherally. For example, severe heart failure can cause pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, ascites and peripheral edema. Such severe systemic edema is called <b>anasarca.</b> In rare cases, a Parvovirus B19 infection may cause generalized edemas.|$|E

50|$|In {{experimental}} infections, {{the virus}} is spread transplacentally when the dam is infected between 25 and 30 days of gestation and can result in abortion. When the dam is infected between 30 and 35 days, the puppies were sometimes born with myocarditis and <b>anasarca.</b> Pathological lesions in fetuses in experimental infections {{were found in the}} lung and small intestine.|$|E
50|$|Criteria {{for severe}} OHSS include {{enlarged}} ovary, ascites, hematocrit > 45%, WBC > 15,000, oliguria, creatinine 1.0-1.5 mg/dl, creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min, liver dysfunction, and <b>anasarca.</b> Critical OHSS includes enlarged ovary, tense ascites with hydrothorax and pericardial effusion, hematocrit > 55%, WBC > 25,000, oligoanuria, creatinine > 1.6 mg/dl, creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, renal failure, thromboembolic phenomena, and ARDS.|$|E
50|$|Dexters {{can also}} be {{affected}} with PHA (Pulmonary Hypoplasia with <b>Anasarca)</b> which is an incomplete formation of the lungs with accumulation of a serum fluid {{in various parts of}} the tissue of the fetus. Unlike Chondrodysplasia, which has many physical signs, PHA shows no outward signs and is only possible to detect through DNA testing. As with Chondrodysplasia, PHA affected Dexters should not be bred together.|$|E
50|$|Nephrotic {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} large proteinuria (>3.5 g per 1.73 m2 body surface area per day, or > 40 mg per square meter body surface area per hour in children), hypoalbuminemia (< 2,5 g/dl), hyperlipidaemia, and edema (which is generalized and also known as <b>anasarca</b> or dropsy) that begins in the face. Lipiduria (lipids in urine) can also occur, but is not essential for the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Hyponatremia also occurs with a low fractional sodium excretion.|$|E
50|$|Castleman disease: The {{lymphoproliferative}} disorder Castleman disease associated with POEMS syndrome is multicentric and occurs in ~15 of cases. It {{is characterized by}} a morphology in lymph nodes termed angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia; an overly activate immune system; excessive production of cytokines including particularly IL-6 and to lesser extents, proliferation of immune B cells and T cells, enlarged lymph nodes, enlarged liver and spleen, capillary leak syndrome, <b>anasarca,</b> evidence of extravascular fluid overload, and organ failure. Patients with Castleman disease without a plasma cell dyscrasia and peripheral neuropathy but having other signs and symptoms of POEMS syndrome can be classified as a Castleman disease variant of POEMS syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Backward {{failure of}} the right {{ventricle}} leads to congestion of systemic capillaries. This generates excess fluid accumulation in the body. This causes swelling under the skin (termed peripheral edema or <b>anasarca)</b> and usually affects the dependent {{parts of the body}} first (causing foot and ankle swelling in people who are standing up, and sacral edema in people who are predominantly lying down). Nocturia (frequent nighttime urination) may occur when fluid from the legs is returned to the bloodstream while lying down at night. In progressively severe cases, ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity causing swelling) and liver enlargement may develop. Significant liver congestion may result in impaired liver function (congestive hepatopathy), and jaundice and even coagulopathy (problems of decreased or increased blood clotting) may occur.|$|E
5000|$|A 5-track promo disc was {{recorded}} in 1999, which {{captured the attention of}} several record labels. However, the band opted to sign with Danish Label Mighty Music. The same five tracks were released as the Resurgence of Oblivion MCD. In 2001, Beheaded composed all the songs for the upcoming ‘Recounts of Disembodiment’ full-length between January and May 2001. The recording took place once again at Temple Studios in June 2001 with sound engineer David Vella behind the mixing desk. ‘The European Extermination Tour’ took place all over Europe in July 2001 which saw Beheaded headline alongside label mates <b>Anasarca,</b> stopping by at the Obscene Extreme Festival [...] in the Czech Republic. 2001 was the year when Chris got endorsed by Paiste for his abilities behind the skins.|$|E
50|$|By December 4 he {{was back}} in Adams U. S. Army General Hospital in Memphis where he was called a “convalescent” with the {{notation}} that he had returned from “Desertion, furlough.” After three months he was considered fit for duty, even though he still carried a diagnosis of chronic diarrhea, and was back aboard the R. C. Wood bound for Nashville. When he got there on March 19, 1864 he was admitted to Cumberland U. S. Army General Hospital with a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis. Twelve days later, he was apparently still not considered able to return to combat and was made an “Attendant at Large” within the hospital. After only {{a month and a half}} of being an attendant, Joseph was diagnosed with <b>anasarca,</b> a severe edema associated with kidney or liver failure that could be fatal.|$|E
5000|$|Edema {{is thought}} to be caused by two mechanisms. The first being hypoalbuminemia which lowers the oncotic {{pressure}} within vessels resulting in hypovolemia and subsequent activation of the Renin-angiotensin system and thus retention of sodium and water. Additionally, it is thought that albumin causes a direct effect on the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) on the principal cell that leads to the reabsorption of sodium and water. Nephrotic syndrome edema initially appears in parts of the lower body (such as the legs) and in the eyelids. In the advanced stages it also extends to the pleural cavity and peritoneum (ascites) and can even develop into a generalized <b>anasarca.</b> It has been recently seen that intrarenal sodium handling abnormality is related to Atrial Natriuretic Peptide resistance is associated with decreased abundance and altered subcellular localization of dopamine receptor in renal tubules.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{receiving}} {{the diagnosis of}} <b>anasarca,</b> Joseph was discharged from the army. Six months later, just before the Battle of Nashville, he again showed up at Cumberland U. S. Army General Hospital and was readmitted into the army. It {{is not clear what}} he did {{for the remainder of the}} war. Three letters from the Surgeon in Charge of Volunteers at the Cumberland Hospital, dated December 31, 1864, February 8, 1865 and March 31, 1865, were written on his behalf stating that he was a patient or was sick in hospital. It is hard to say whether or not he was actually so sick that he had to be hospitalized or the surgeon wanted to keep him as an attendant because he was good at his duties. According to the adjutant general's report for Company B of the 127th Illinois Heywood was mustered out as a corporal on May 27, 1865.|$|E
50|$|MCD {{clinical}} features range from waxing and waning mild {{enlargement of the}} lymph nodes with B symptoms to more severe cases involving intense inflammation, widespread enlargement of lymph nodes enlargement of the liver and spleen, vascular leak syndrome with <b>anasarca,</b> fluid collections in the space around the lungs, and fluid collection in the abdomen's peritoneal space, organ failure, and even death. The most common 'B Symptoms' of MCD are high fevers, night sweats, weight loss, and loss of appetite. Acute episodes can display significant clinical overlap with acute viral illnesses, autoimmune diseases, hematologic malignancies, and even sepsis. Laboratory findings commonly include low red blood cell count, low or high platelet counts, low albumin, high gamma globulin levels, elevated C-reactive protein levels, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and fibrinogen; positive anti-nuclear antibody, anti-erythrocyte autoantibodies, and anti-platelet antibodies; and protein spilling into the urine, and polyclonal marrow plasmacytosis. Castleman disease is seen in POEMS syndrome and is implicated in 10% of cases of paraneoplastic pemphigus.|$|E
5000|$|Edema: in {{addition}} to nephrotic syndrome {{there are two other}} disorders that often present with edema; these are heart failure and liver failure. Congestive heart failure can cause liquid retention in tissues {{as a consequence of the}} decrease in the strength of ventricular contractions. The liquid is initially concentrated in the ankles but it subsequently becomes generalized and is called <b>anasarca.</b> Patients with congestive heart failure also experience an abnormal swelling of the heart cardiomegaly, which aids in making a correct diagnosis. Jugular venous pressure can also be elevated and it might be possible to hear heart murmurs. An echocardiogram is the preferred investigation method for these symptoms. Liver failure caused by cirrhosis, hepatitis and other conditions such as alcoholism, IV drug use or some hereditary diseases can lead to swelling in the lower extremities and the abdominal cavity. Other accompanying symptoms include jaundice, dilated veins over umbilicus (caput medusae), scratch marks (due to widespread itching, known as pruritus), enlarged spleen, spider angiomata, encephalopathy, bruising, nodular liver and anomalies in the liver function tests. Less frequently symptoms associated with the administration of certain pharmaceutical drugs have to be discounted. These drugs promote the retention of liquid in the extremities such as occurs with NSAIs, some antihypertensive drugs, the adrenal corticosteroids and sex hormones.|$|E
40|$|English Bulldogs are {{the most}} common breed to have pulmonic stenosis. Previous studies showed that this {{congenital}} heart abnormality in Bulldogs frequently is caused by a circumpulmonary left coronary artery originating from a single right coronary artery. Fetal <b>anasarca</b> also occurs often in Bulldogs and might represent congestive heart failure, but the cause is unknown. To determine if fetal <b>anasarca</b> is associated with a coronary anomaly and pulmonic stenosis, major coronary arteries were studied in 6 bulldog puppies with fetal <b>anasarca.</b> Five of the puppies had normal coronary arteries, and this led to the conclusion that fetal <b>anasarca</b> usually is not associated with major coronary abnormalities or pulmonic stenosis. The 6 th puppy had single right coronary artery with circumpulmonary left coronary artery and moderate subvalvular pulmonic stenosis. Serial section histology suggests that the underlying cause of this syndrome is malformation of the left aortic sinus (of Valsalva) and inversion of the proximal segment of the left main coronary artery...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{report a}} case of {{intravascular}} lymphoma (IVL) in a Caucasian patient who presented with <b>anasarca</b> as his sole clinical sign. Material and Methods: A man presented with anasarca-type oedema and fatigue. After excluding heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, AL-amyloidosis and adverse drug reaction which can all cause oedema, we turned our attention to capillary permeability disorders. Results: Closer review of the bone marrow aspirate demonstrated haemophagocytic histiocytosis, while core, renal and duodenal biopsies showed a B-cell IVL. Conclusion: The differential diagnosis of <b>anasarca,</b> a relatively common clinical sign, should include IVL although the diagnosis may still be challenging...|$|E

40|$|Generalized {{subcutaneous}} edema is a {{very rare}} manifestation of inflammatory myopathies. A 61 -year-old woman presented with classic {{signs and symptoms of}} dermatomyositis. She was also noted to have generalized edema that was so florid that an alternative diagnosis was considered. Her disease was resistant to corticosteroids, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil. Intravenous administration of immunoglobulins was started because of marked worsening of her disease-muscle weakness, generalized <b>anasarca,</b> and involvement of her bulbar muscles. This led to dramatic resolution of her subcutaneous edema and significant improvement of her skin and muscle disease. As the initial screen for malignancy was negative, a positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan was requested, which interestingly showed a metabolically active cervical tumor. <b>Anasarca</b> is an unusual manifestation of dermatomyositis.

40|$|Generalized edema (<b>anasarca)</b> {{is common}} in {{nephrotic}} syndrome which rarely produces short-ness of breath. Increased shortness of breath associated with rapid weight gain and generalized edema signify congestive heart failure (CHF). Loop diuretics consisting of furosemide (Lasix®), bumetanide (Bumex®), torsemide (Demadex®) or ethacrynic acid (Edecrin) are effective diuretics to treat <b>anasarca.</b> However, efficacy varies depending on the renal function. Loop diuretic given orally or by intravenous boluses produce good urine output but overall response in reducing edema or shortness of breath as in CHF is less than optimum.
