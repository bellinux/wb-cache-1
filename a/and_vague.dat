5|$|Washington later {{submitted}} a formal {{account of the}} expenses that he had personally advanced the army over the eight-year conflict of about $450,000.

5|$|After the Chancery Regulation Act 1862 {{had gone}} some way toward {{procedural}} reform, in February 1867, Roundell Palmer again brought {{the problem of}} having two separate court systems to Parliament's attention, and in March 1870 Lord Hatherley introduced a bill to create a single, unified High Court of Justice. The bill was a weak one, not containing any provision addressing which court would deal with the common law and which with equity, and was also silent {{on the structure of}} the court, as Hatherley believed the difference between the common law and equity was one of procedure, not substance. As a result, the bill was heavily opposed from two sides: those who opposed fusion, and those who supported fusion but felt the provisions were too weak <b>and</b> <b>vague</b> to be of any use. As a result, the bill was eventually withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|LGBT rights activists, {{human rights}} activists, {{and other critics}} stated that the broad <b>and</b> <b>vague</b> wording of the law, which was {{characterized}} as a ban on gay propaganda by the media, made {{it a crime to}} publicly make statements or distribute materials in support of LGBT rights, hold pride parades or similar demonstrations, state that gay relationships are equal to heterosexual relationships, or according to Human Rights Campaign (HRC) president Chad Griffin, even display LGBT symbols such as the rainbow flag or kiss a same-sex partner in public. The first arrest made under the law involved a person who publicly protested with a sign containing a pro-LGBT message.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{discussion}} in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called analytic philosophy (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy). Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (<b>and</b> <b>vague)</b> label of continental philosophy. In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, {{in relation to the}} philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label (phenomenology, existentialism, etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to {{the discussion}} of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of thought and perceptual experience in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.|$|E
5|$|When Antoine was alive, many {{observers}} {{thought that the}} healings he obtained resulted to suggestion only, and Dr. Schuind, who wrote two articles in The Meuse (La Meuse) on the subject at the time, criticized the lack of control <b>and</b> <b>vague</b> diagnostics surrounding these healings. Sociologist Anne-Cécile Bégot considered the Antoinist healing of the first decades a form of protest against (1) the efficiency of medicine, (2) the traditional representation of disease—the real healing can be attained only through {{a new approach to}} the disease, which is never considered a particular misfortune and thus is not reduced to its biological dimension—and (3) the management of disease—sick are always responsible for their own illness. However, she concluded that this protest has evolved throughout time as (1) the disease is now represented on an endogenous etiological model, which indicates a process of individualization of the religion, and (2) the personal real-life experience is more presented as the cause of the disease than the relation to the global society.|$|E

In popular discourse, Pătrășcanu was also largely identified with positive causes, and remained among the most popular Communist figures after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 toppled the regime.|$|E

On 29 June 1794, three colleagues of Robespierre at 'the Committee' called him a dictator in his face – Robespierre baffled left the meeting. This encouraged other Convention members to also defy Robespierre. On 26 July, a long <b>and</b> <b>vague</b> speech of Robespierre wasn't met with thunderous applause as usual but with hostility; some deputies yelled that Robespierre should {{have the courage to}} say which deputies he deemed necessary to be killed next, what Robespierre refused to do.|$|E

25|$|Bentley {{provided}} no documentary {{evidence to support}} her claims and the accuracy of her allegations was long disputed. The subsequent declassification of both Soviet documents and the U.S. codebreaking Venona project in later decades have lent some credence to the basis of Bentley's allegations, and showed that after her defection the Soviet Union temporarily suspended espionage activities in the United States. However, some of Bentley's claims remain controversial due to questions about the accuracy of translations <b>and</b> <b>vague</b> nature of the exact identities of those with code names in Venona (along with several dubious claims made {{in the years following}} her defection to the United States).|$|E

25|$|In the kinetic theory, heat is {{explained}} in terms of the microscopic motions and interactions of constituent particles, such as electrons, atoms, and molecules. The immediate meaning of the kinetic energy of the constituent particles is not as heat. It is as a component of internal energy. In microscopic terms, heat is a transfer quantity, and is described by a transport theory, not as steadily localized kinetic energy of particles. Heat transfer arises from temperature gradients or differences, through the diffuse exchange of microscopic kinetic and potential particle energy, by particle collisions and other interactions. An early <b>and</b> <b>vague</b> expression of this was made by Francis Bacon. Precise and detailed versions of it were developed in the nineteenth century.|$|E

Two other Leeds clubs, The Warehouse and The Garage featured in the Top 100 Clubs list from 2013.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{what are}} known as Isaac Newton's occult studies can largely be {{attributed}} to his study of alchemy. Newton was deeply interested in all forms of natural sciences and materials science, an interest which would ultimately lead to some of his better-known contributions to science. During Newton's lifetime, the study of chemistry was still in its infancy, so many of his experimental studies used esoteric language <b>and</b> <b>vague</b> terminology more typically associated with alchemy and occultism. It was not until several decades after Newton's death that experiments of stoichiometry under the pioneering works of Antoine Lavoisier were conducted, and analytical chemistry, with its associated nomenclature, came to resemble modern chemistry as we know it today. However, Newton's contemporary and fellow Royal Society member, Robert Boyle, had already discovered the basic concepts of modern chemistry and began establishing modern norms of experimental practice and communication in chemistry, information which Newton did not use.|$|E
