We have arranged in distinct books {{to the number of}} one hundred, so that they might be no longer scattered, as many of these <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to collect, which have been preserved here and there by different persons.|$|E
500|$|In {{an opinion}} piece for Foreign Policy, Max Boot {{outlines}} his views thusly: [...] "I am socially liberal: I am pro-LGBTQ rights, pro-abortion rights, pro-immigration. I am fiscally conservative: I {{think we need}} to reduce the deficit and get entitlement spending under control. I am pro-environment: I think that climate change is a major threat that we need to address. I am pro-free trade: I think we should be concluding new trade treaties rather than pulling out of old ones. I am strong on defense: I {{think we need to}} beef up our military to cope with multiple enemies. And I am very much in favor of America acting as a world leader: I believe it is in our own self-interest to promote and defend freedom and free markets <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing {{in one form or another}} since at least 1898." ...|$|E
500|$|The ways {{in which}} St Vincent chose to {{communicate}} the rejections often depended {{on the number of}} letters, the individual concerned, or the demands made by their respective well wishers. To the Earl of Portsmouth he wrote: [...] "I cannot possibly agree in opinion with your Lordship, that a person sitting quietly by his fireside, and enjoying very nearly a sinecure, during such a war <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> engaged in, has the same pretensions to promotion with the man who has exposed his person, and hazarded his constitution in every clime." [...] A harsh rebuff to a peer of the realm. Yet to a lady of no discernible rank or influence he wrote: [...] "Although I cannot admit the force of your argument in favour of Captain (name unknown) , there is something so amiable and laudable in a sister contending for the promotion of her brother that no apology was necessary for your letter of the 24th, which I lose no time in acknowledging;" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{did indeed}} look sleepy, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> riding many hours I forbore to trouble him further.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{not worth}} ten cents," [...] said Aaron, with {{something}} like a frown on his brow. [...] "But <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> talking about the bridge, I thought Miss Susan would accept it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "My {{perception}} <b>was</b> that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> ambushed, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> briefed that Taliban {{were expected}} to use ambush tactics in and around Kandahar. I believed that the projectiles posed a real and present danger to our flight and specifically to my flight lead..." ...|$|R
500|$|Reception of {{the race}} was mainly negative. Italian {{newspaper}} Corriere dello Sport â€“ Stadio called it [...] "boring", while fellow Italian paper Corriere della Sera wrote of [...] "Formula One like a sleeping pill". Sky Sports described the race as [...] "mundane" [...] and [...] "soporific". Spanish newspaper Sport highlighted Max Verstappen's [...] "spectacular" [...] overtaking as bringing [...] "the only colour" [...] into the race. The Independent wrote, referring to Hamilton's desperate attempts to pass Rosberg: [...] "If {{there was ever a}} race which confirmed that Formula One should be looking at ways to facilitate overtaking, this was it." [...] In the wake of his experience, Hamilton called for Formula One to adjust rules to enhance overtaking, saying: [...] "I guess for fans it's probably not too exciting to watch. Of course, it's always nice when you're at the front, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> for some time now - but still, being able to race is what... and also down the back, {{the rest of the field}} is probably what fans want to see. That's probably a change that would be looked positively on." [...] Sebastian Vettel agreed, calling for more grip created by the tyres to make it easier to follow a car closely.|$|E
2500|$|Brown first {{ran for the}} Democratic {{nomination}} for president in March 1976, after the primary season had begun, and over a year after some candidates had started campaigning. Brown declared: [...] "The country is rich, but not so rich <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> led to believe. The choice {{to do one thing}} may preclude another. In short, we are entering an era of limits." ...|$|E
2500|$|Federal Health Minister Tony Abbott {{also said}} that the Singapore government's {{decision}} {{to go ahead with the}} execution was wrong and that the punishment [...] "certainly did not fit the crime.... But people do need to understand that drug trafficking is a very serious offence and it has heavy penalties in Australia and it has even more drastic penalties overseas <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reminded today." ...|$|E
60|$|During {{such time}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{speaking}} the pace was not slackened, {{and that the}} cowardly cur had lost all heart, I understood when he forged ahead at his best speed, as if believing implicitly in the threat I had made.|$|R
60|$|We {{crossed the}} quadrangle, and passing under a second archway {{came into the}} inner bailey <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> bidden. Here <b>we</b> were met by Confalonieri, who also had half a dozen men with him. He greeted us, and issued his orders sharply.|$|R
60|$|We adjourned to one {{of those}} pretty cafes and took supper and tested the wines of the country, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{instructed}} to do, and found them harmless and unexciting. They might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> exciting, however, if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> chosen to drink a sufficiency of them.|$|R
2500|$|The {{participants}} at the Potsdam Conference asserted that expulsions were {{the only way to}} prevent ethnic violence. As Winston Churchill expounded in the House of Commons in 1944, [...] "Expulsion is the method which, insofar <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to see, will be the most satisfactory and lasting. There will be no mixture of populations to cause endless trouble... A clean sweep will be made. I am not alarmed by the prospect of disentanglement of populations, not even of these large transferences, which are more possible in modern conditions than they have ever been before".|$|E
2500|$|As he expounded in the House of Commons on 15 December 1944, [...] "Expulsion is {{the method}} which, insofar <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to see, {{will be the}} most {{satisfactory}} and lasting. There will be no mixture of populations to cause endless trouble... A clean sweep will be made. I am not alarmed by these transferences, which are more possible in modern conditions." [...] However, the resulting expulsions of Germans were carried out in a way which resulted in much hardship and, according to a 1966 report by the West German Ministry of Refugees and Displaced Persons, over 2.1million Germans dead or missing. Churchill opposed the Soviet domination of Poland and wrote bitterly about it in his books, but was unable to prevent it at the conferences.|$|E
60|$|We're too different. It's {{impossible}} {{for it to}} get better. We can't even go on <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> I've felt that the end was coming.|$|E
6000|$|Our visitor was {{apparently}} not so deeply {{impressed by the}} treatment of the subject here outlined <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> intending and expecting he should be. He asked, after a moment, [...] "Don't you think that would be rather a heavy-handed way of dealing with the matter?" ...|$|R
60|$|Amazing! the {{flexibility}} of the royal elbow, and the rigidity of the royal spine! More especially <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> impressed with a notion of their debility. But, sometimes these seemingly enervated young blades approve themselves steadier of limb, than veteran revelers of very long standing.|$|R
60|$|But the experts, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> shown, <b>were</b> of a {{different}} opinion.|$|R
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> led, {{in writing}} about ships of the navy, to refer to steam, we turn aside {{at this point to}} treat of that {{tremendous}} motive-power.|$|E
6000|$|... "It does feel homelike here," [...] Chebron said, looking round, [...] "especially after {{sleeping}} {{in the open air}} on the hard ground, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing for the last month." ...|$|E
60|$|You figure us {{returning}} {{after a day}} or so of such Utopian {{experiences as}} I must presently describe, to the central office in Lucerne, even <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> told to do.|$|E
60|$|Uncle Roger <b>was,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> informed, quite jolly and fond of teasing. We liked him; but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{an uncomfortable}} {{feeling that the}} meaning of his remarks was not always that which met the ear. Sometimes we {{believed}} Uncle Roger was making fun of us, and the deadly seriousness of youth in us resented that.|$|R
60|$|The horses fed right royally {{and soon}} forgot {{the dearth of}} the big divide. As we were {{saddling}} up to move the following morning, several outfits came trailing down into the valley, glad <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> of the splendid field of grass. They were led by a grizzled old American, who cursed the country with fine fervor.|$|R
60|$|Young as I was, I {{believe that}} I dated a new admiration of Joe from that night. We <b>were</b> equals {{afterwards}}, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> before; but, afterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe {{and thinking about}} him, I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up to Joe in my heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have five}} hundred warriors with me, armed {{and ready for}} battle. You are in my power; but <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> friends and neighbors, I will not take {{advantage}} of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> wetted to {{the waist}} a score of times, in the streams, I don't see {{that it would have}} mattered much, if the rest of us had been wet through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{necessarily}} brilliant, {{but there}} are things we have always enjoyed which must be looked for--a good name, position, the right to meet people brought up <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> on an equal footing." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "To live on <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> {{to leave}} behind joy, and love, and companionship, because we know it to be transitory, of the moment. We know it will turn to ash. Only those whose lives are brief can imagine that love is eternal. You should embrace that {{remarkable}} illusion. It may be the greatest gift your race has ever received." ...|$|R
60|$|We were hospitably entertained in Concord, New Hampshire, {{which we}} persisted in calling New Concord, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> wont, to {{distinguish}} it from our native town, from which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> told that it was named and in part originally settled. This would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the proper place to conclude our voyage, uniting Concord with Concord by these meandering rivers, but our boat was moored some miles below its port.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> felt <b>as</b> {{much of a}} shock <b>as</b> if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> one of the {{expectant}} guests ourselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what would}} your own father say, Philip? Oh, it is quite {{impossible}} we can ever be more than friends,--brother and sister in secret, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> Let us give up thinking of everything else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Father,' {{broke out}} the poor boy again, 'you cannot mean to part us! Let us abide <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> till I am of age {{to take my}} vows! I am not fit to serve the King.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Alon. Never were beasts so hunted into toils, [...] <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{pursued by}} dreadful shapes.-- [...] But {{is not that}} my son? O Ferdinand! [...] If thou art not a ghost, let me embrace thee.|$|E
6000|$|While we {{ate with}} so much of {{pleasure}} I could not but let my thoughts go out to Saul, who was doubtless <b>as</b> hungry <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> and gave words to my regret that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not first carried the lad some of the food which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> in such generous abundance; but to my repinings of this kind little Frenchie put a stop by saying: ...|$|R
60|$|Master Lord {{refused to}} answer, and I asked myself if Hiram {{could be so}} venturesome as to think it {{possible}} we might carry these two Tories out of the town. If so, then our wondrous fortune must have turned his head, for verily none but a madman would, after having gotten out of such a tangle <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in, take yet more desperate chances.|$|R
60|$|She was {{perfectly}} unembarrassed and unaffected. <b>We</b> fell <b>as</b> easily into talk <b>as</b> if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> friends instead of strangers.|$|R
