5|$|To {{help him}} out, Bart gets Buck {{a job on}} Krusty the Clown's show, but Buck gets drunk and makes <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> of himself on air, {{crushing}} Bart. Seeing this, Marge and Homer decide to help Buck overcome his alcoholism, so they clean out Buck's house and enroll him in an Alcoholics Anonymous program. Despite making progress, Buck is not restored to hero-status for Bart.|$|E

Homer gets annoyed, but reluctantly decides to take them there. The family goes to Mt. Splashmore, where Bart, Lisa and Homer ride an intense water slide named H2WHOA!. Due to his weight, Homer gets lodged in the water slide mid-course and the park's rescue crew are forced {{to shut down the}} ride and remove him {{with the help of a}} large crane. Homer is made <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> of on the news for his massive size and admits that he needs to lose weight.|$|E
5|$|During {{a series}} of combats held to {{celebrate}} King Joffrey Baratheon's name day, the captive Sansa Stark saves the drunkard Ser Dontos Hollard's life by convincing Joffrey to make him <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> instead of killing him. The festivities are interrupted {{by the arrival of}} Tyrion Lannister, who has been sent to the capital to act as Hand of the King in his father's stead. Cersei is furious, but accepts the new situation after her brother assures her that he will only act as an advisor. When Tyrion learns that Cersei has let Arya Stark escape after the execution of her father, he mocks her for throwing away two valuable hostages, as he'd planned to trade the girls for Jaime.|$|E

Law, The Wonder Years, NYPD Blue, and Monty, in the early 1990s. Schwimmer later gained worldwide recognition for playing Ross Geller in the sitcom Friends, for which he received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1995. His first leading film role was in The Pallbearer (1996), followed by roles in Kissing <b>a</b> <b>Fool</b> (1998), Six Days, Seven Nights (1998), Apt Pupil, and Picking Up the Pieces (2000). He was then cast in the miniseries Band of Brothers (2001) as Herbert Sobel.|$|E
5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E
5|$|Tudor's {{plan was}} to export ice as a luxury good to wealthy members of West Indies and the {{southern}} US states, where he hoped they would relish the product during their sweltering summers; conscious of the risk that others might follow suit, Tudor hoped to acquire local monopoly rights in his new markets {{in order to maintain}} high prices and profits. He started by attempting to establish a monopoly on the potential ice trade in the Caribbean and invested in a brigantine ship to transport ice bought from farmers around Boston. At the time, Tudor was regarded by the business community at best as something of an eccentric, and at worst <b>a</b> <b>fool.</b>|$|E

5|$|With the {{encouragement}} of his Protestant advisers, James summoned the English Parliament in 1624 {{so that he could}} request subsidies for a war. Charles and Buckingham supported the impeachment of the Lord Treasurer, Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, who opposed war on grounds of cost and who quickly fell in much the same manner as Bacon had. James told Buckingham he was <b>a</b> <b>fool,</b> and presciently warned his son that he would live to regret the revival of impeachment as a parliamentary tool. An under-funded makeshift army under Ernst von Mansfeld set off to recover the Palatinate, but it was so poorly provisioned that it never advanced beyond the Dutch coast.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> of himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives {{on the scene and}} despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their car on the rail for several miles. When the Simpsons get off of the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held by a judge in front of the capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors. It turns out that he was never dead but rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, though they are banned from entering the state of Florida again (and several other states, excluding Arizona and North Dakota).|$|E

25|$|Ipomadon {{travels the}} world, {{fighting}} in tournaments, becomes King of Apulia following his father's death, and hears {{one day that}} the Proud is being besieged in her city by a knight called Lyoline. This ugly knight is threatening to take her away with him to India. Ipomadon {{makes his way to}} King Maleager's court once again, just in time to witness the arrival of the Proud's messenger, begging for some assistance for her lady. But curiously, Ipomadon has chosen to arrive at King Maleager's court {{in such a way that}} he is not recognised, not even by the queen. He pretends to be <b>a</b> <b>fool,</b> and the reader (or listener) is treated to a comic scene in which the fool Ipomadon is first ridiculed and then accepted by the knights and noblemen, little knowing who he really is. Cabanus is conveniently absent from court on this occasion. The maiden who has been sent as a messenger by the Proud is mightily unimpressed that <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> should wish to take on the challenge, but since nobody else in the court seems at all inclined to offer their services, the king allows Ipomadon the fool to take it up.|$|E
25|$|The auguste {{character}}-type {{is often}} an anarchist, a joker, or <b>a</b> <b>fool.</b> He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface.

Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.|$|E
