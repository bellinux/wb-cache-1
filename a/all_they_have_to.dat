500|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the sixth}} Harry Potter film began in late 2007, with Watson's part being filmed from 18 December to 17 May 2008. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince premiered on 15 July 2009, having been delayed from November 2008. With the lead actors now in their late teens, critics were increasingly willing to review them {{on the same level}} {{as the rest of the}} film's all-star cast, which the Los Angeles Times described as [...] "a comprehensive guide to contemporary UK acting". The Washington Post felt Watson to have given [...] " [...] most charming performance to date", while The Daily Telegraph described the lead actors as [...] "newly liberated and energised, eager to give <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> what's left of the series". In December 2008, Watson stated she wanted to go to university after she completed the Potter series.|$|E
500|$|Steve Harris, Iron Maiden's bassist {{and primary}} songwriter, {{has stated that}} his {{influences}} include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull, Thin Lizzy, UFO and Wishbone Ash. In 2010 Harris stated, [...] "I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is listen to Wishbone Ash's Argus album. Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then {{we wanted to have}} a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it." [...] In 2004, Harris explained that the band's [...] "heaviness" [...] was inspired by [...] "Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in." [...] On top of this, Harris developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as [...] "more like a rhythm guitar," [...] cited as responsible for the band's galloping style, heard in such songs as [...] "The Trooper" [...] and [...] "Run to the Hills." ...|$|E
2500|$|Generally men aged 50 years, and on some islands men aged 60 years, {{do most of}} {{the talking}} and {{decision}} making at meetings of the community councils (Falekaupule), which are organised according to the law and custom of each island. Although women have the vote in meetings of the Falekaupule on [...] 7 of the 9 islands, but most do no exercise their voting rights. Milikini Failautusi, young Tuvaluan activist, has argued that cultural issues in Tuvalu are preventing women from working in equal partnership with men. For example, women cannot be appointed as an aliki (chief). Ms Failautusi is quoted as saying [...] "hen it comes to cultures, women they don't [...] to say anything at all. They don't have a say. They only have to sit at the back and support the elders or their husbands or the leaders in their families [...] [...] [...] <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is just support them in terms of looking for money, looking for food, and looking after the babies and the families".|$|E

60|$|You see how strangely {{they are}} dressed. An iron helmet, {{like a great}} iron pot, is over each of their heads, and a reservoir, into which the air is pumped, is on their backs.

60|$|Besides, {{difference}} in opinion, especially {{in matters of}} great moment, breeds no confusion at all. Witness Papist and Protestant, Roundhead and Cavalier, Whig and Tory, now among us. I observe, the Turkish empire is more at peace within itself, than Christian princes are with one another. Those noble Turkish virtues of charity and toleration, are what contribute chiefly to the flourishing state of that happy monarchy. There Christians and Jews are tolerated, and live at ease, if they can hold their tongues and think freely, provided they never set foot within the mosques, nor write against Mahomet: A few plunderings now {{and then by the}} janissaries are <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fear.|$|E

"You see," [...] Dick Caister said, [...] "these fellows have a {{remarkable}} objection to putting their necks {{in the way}} of a noose; so that although they may lug out a pistol and shout 'Bail up!' they will very seldom draw a trigger, if you show fight.

60|$|Let the House {{think of}} it. The {{process of the}} {{election}} of Members of Parliament is extremely elaborate. The candidates go about the country {{for two or three}} weeks saying <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say for themselves in the different constituencies which they are contesting; {{at the end of that}} exhaustive discussion there is an elaborate process of voting; the returns are counted with the most scrupulous care; and as the result 670 Members, representing 6,000,000 of voters and many more who take a deep interest in public affairs but have no votes, are returned to the House of Commons in the name of the people of Great Britain and Ireland. The new Parliament assembles. Scarcely any question at the election had been more a test question, so far as the supporters of the Government are concerned, than the question of the amendment of the education system of the country. A Bill dealing with education is brought forward as the principal measure of the first session of the new Parliament. Weeks are occupied in its discussion. It represents the fulfilment of the election pledges of every Member who supported it. The Bill is passed by perhaps the largest majority that ever sent a Bill from this House to another place.|$|E
60|$|This, however strange it may seem, is {{that which}} every day's {{experience}} confirms; and will not, perhaps, appear so wonderful, if we consider the ways and steps by which it is brought about; and how really it may come to pass, that doctrines that have been derived from no better original than the superstition of a nurse, or the authority of an old woman, may, by length of time and consent of neighbours, grow up to the dignity of PRINCIPLES in religion or morality. For such, who are careful (as they call it) to principle children well, (and few there be who have not a set of those principles for them, which they believe in,) instil into the unwary, and as yet unprejudiced, understanding, (for white paper receives any characters,) those doctrines they would have them retain and profess. These being taught them {{as soon as they}} have any apprehension; and still as they grow up confirmed to them, either by the open profession or tacit consent of <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do with; or at least by those of whose wisdom, knowledge, and piety they have an opinion, who never suffer those propositions to be otherwise mentioned but as the basis and foundation on which they build their religion and manners, come, by these means, to have the reputation of unquestionable, self-evident, and innate truths.|$|E
6000|$|... 211. Suppose, for instance, in our English army, {{on the eve}} of {{some great}} battle, one of the colonels were to give his order to his regiment: [...] "My men, tie your belts over your eyes, throw down your muskets, and follow me as {{steadily}} as you can, through this marsh, {{into the middle of the}} enemy's line," [...] (this being precisely the order issued by our Puseyite Church officers). It might be questioned, in the real battle, whether it would be better that a regiment should show an example of insubordination, or be cut to pieces. But happily in the Church there is no such difficulty; for the King is always with His army: not only with His army, but at the right hand of every soldier of it. Therefore, if any of their colonels give them a strange command, <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is to ask the King; and never yet any Christian asked guidance of his King, in any difficulty whatsoever, without mental reservation or secret resolution, but he had it forthwith. We conclude then, finally, that the authority of the Clergy is, in matters of discipline, large (being executive, first, of the written laws of God, and secondly, of those determined and agreed upon by the body of the Church), in matters of doctrine, dependent on their recommending themselves to every man's conscience, both as messengers of God, and as themselves men of God, perfect, and instructed to good works.[150] ...|$|E
