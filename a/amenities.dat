40|$|<b>Amenity</b> is a {{term that}} has re-emerged within both public policy and {{environmental}} management organisations {{in response to an}} increasing emphasis on the human benefits derived from ecosystems. However, practical implementation of <b>amenity</b> management has been difficult {{due to a lack of}} definitional clarity within operational and academic literature. This article discusses the need for definitional clarity and understanding of the component elements of <b>amenity</b> that are integral to ecological management and reviews the literature on the perceptions and definitions of <b>amenity</b> in varied contexts. This study argues that positive perceptions of <b>amenity</b> benefits of a place are influenced by both physical elements such as sight, sound and smell and social elements such as age, education and cultural values. These elements should be considered by management agencies in a structured manner in order for the full potential of <b>amenity</b> to be realised. We present a conceptual framework to provide definitional clarity to the concept of <b>amenity</b> and highlight the interactions among its constituent elements. For the management of human-dominated landscapes, considering the relationship between <b>amenity</b> and biodiversity may improve the integration of ecological and social goals...|$|R

40|$|Current {{government}} {{guidelines for}} the appraisal of coastal defence projects in the UK do not require that non-market <b>amenity</b> benefits to be considered.

This paper reports {{the findings of a}} choice experiment study that evaluated the <b>amenity</b> benefits of four alternative coastal defence systems currently being considered for Borth in west Wales. The results indicate that traditional coastal defence options such as timber and rock groynes do not generate <b>amenity</b> benefits, while a multipurpose reef would generate significant benefits in terms of improvements in the visual appeal of the beach, safer swimming opportunities and improved surfing conditions. Importantly, these benefits were found to be significant for all members of the local community and not just surf ers.

40|$|To {{achieve a}} given level of an {{environmental}} <b>amenity</b> at least cost, decision-makers must integrate information about spatially variable biophysical and economic conditions. Although the biophysical attributes that contribute to supplying an environmental <b>amenity</b> are often known, {{the way in which}} these attributes interact to produce the <b>amenity</b> is often unknown. Given the difficulty in converting multiple attributes into a unidimensional physical measure {{of an environmental}} <b>amenity</b> (e. g., habitat quality), analyses in the academic literature tend to use a single biophysical attribute as a proxy for the environmental <b>amenity</b> (e. g., species richness). A narrow focus on a single attribute, however, fails to consider the full range of biophysical attributes that are critical to the supply of an environmental <b>amenity.</b> Drawing on the production efficiency literature, we introduce an alternative conservation targeting approach that relies on distance functions to cost-efficiently allocate conservation funds across a spatially heterogeneous landscape. An approach based on distance functions has the advantage of not requiring a parametric specification of the <b>amenity</b> function (or cost function), but rather only requiring that the decision-maker identify important biophysical and economic attributes. We apply the distance-function approach empirically to an increasingly common, but little studied, conservation initiative: conservation contracting for water quality objectives. The contract portfolios derived from the distance-function application have many desirable properties, including intuitive appeal, robust performance across plausible parametric <b>amenity</b> measures, and the generation of ranking measures that can be easily used by field practitioners in complex decision-making environments that cannot be completely modeled.

40|$|<b>Amenity</b> {{values on}} urban {{arterial}} roads are fraught. This is {{largely due to}} the traditional traffic capacity versus <b>amenity</b> trade-off. This trade-off implies that high-capacity roads must be inherently deficient in <b>amenity</b> due to issues of air quality, noise nuisance and the physical barrier of streams of traffic. However, a more nuanced position – and one adopted by this thesis - is that arterial roads can be both busy thoroughfares and active, enjoyable destinations. This design-led research explores retrofitting <b>amenity</b> values onto existing arterial roads, creating new spaces and improving qualities of a system not originally constructed with <b>amenity</b> in mind. Cuba Street in Lower Hutt is a regionally significant connector intended for future densified development. In addition to the current link function, this road needs to become more attractive as a destination and address. Consideration at the urban scale encourages broad, strategic planning to support <b>amenity</b> holistically. This urban planning addresses topics like desirable densification, transit-oriented development, walkable centres and how these affect the arterial road condition. In moving from urban-scaled to architectural design, the detailed implementation of the greater policies is tested. Architecture is engaged to respond to the immediate arterial road conditions with spaces and surfaces, protective buffers and layers. In this way - with architectural refinement and a comprehensive, coherent strategy - traffic capacity and <b>amenity</b> can be brought into balance...|$|R
