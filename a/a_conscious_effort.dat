5|$|In 738, Quiriguá, a vassal of Copán, Tikal's key {{ally in the}} south, {{switched}} {{allegiance to}} Calakmul, defeated Copán and gained its own independence. It appears that this was <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> {{on the part of}} Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies.

5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E

Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to give them a strange and eccentric appearance.|$|E
5|$|The 1832 {{exhibition}} of Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm, a painting containing apparently gratuitous nude figures, met a hostile reception from critics. From then on, while Etty continued to paint nude {{figures for the}} rest of his career, he made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> to try to illustrate moral lessons with his work. This effort was not wholly successful, and he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some throughout his career. He died in late 1849, and following his death nude paintings went rapidly out of fashion in Britain.|$|E

After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if {{she would be able to}} do justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma.

5|$|Love Kraft is {{the seventh}} studio album by Welsh indie rock band Super Furry Animals, {{released}} on 22 August 2005 through Epic Records in the United Kingdom. The album {{was recorded in}} Spain with producer Mario Caldato Jr and {{was something of a}} departure for the band, with all members contributing songs and lead vocals alongside Gruff Rhys who had been main songwriter for the Super Furries until this point. In selecting tracks for Love Kraft <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> was made by the band not to choose songs on their individual merit but rather to pick those which went well together in order to create as cohesive an album as possible. The album's name was taken from a sex shop, Love Craft, near the Cardiff offices of the Super Furries' management team and is also a nod to American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft.|$|E
5|$|While {{the entire}} script {{was still in}} the draft phase, Maeda revised lines that felt unnatural after asking others for their {{opinions}} on it, including Na-Ga. When writing the script, Maeda made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> to write Charlotte in the framework of an anime series, as opposed to when he wrote the script for Angel Beats!, which he admits he wrote more akin to the framework of a video game. In this way, Toba felt that Charlotte was Maeda's effort to write a story in its purest form that could not be made into a video game, unlike Angel Beats!. Toba also noted that the characters in Charlotte are not written for a video game scenario, especially the protagonist, and went on to echo Horikawa's sentiment that Charlotte is akin to an I novel for Maeda. Toba explained that this is a result of Maeda's effort to remove the restrictions that come from writing the scenario for a video game.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that, while medieval cathedrals served many purposes and, indeed, {{were some}} of the greatest technical achievements of their time, they served a rational economic purpose as well.

While the attempt to forestall entry was ultimately unsuccessful, the extent of cathedral building helps explain why some areas of Europe remained Catholic and alternative forms of Christianity took hold in other locales.
