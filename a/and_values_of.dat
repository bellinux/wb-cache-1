5|$|Botanical gardens {{have always}} {{responded to the}} {{interests}} <b>and</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the day. If a single function were to be chosen from the early literature on botanical gardens, it would be their scientific endeavour and, flowing from this, their instructional value. In their formative years, botanical gardens were gardens for physicians and botanists, but then they progressively became more associated with ornamental horticulture {{and the needs of}} the general public. The scientific reputation of a botanical garden is now judged by the publications coming out of herbaria and similar facilities, not by its living collections. The interest in economic plants now has less relevance, and the concern with plant classification systems has all but disappeared, while a fascination with the curious, beautiful and new seems unlikely to diminish.|$|E

5|$|In theory, the emperor's {{political}} power was absolute, but {{even during the}} Han dynasty, he shared executive powers with civilian officials and normally based his decisions on the advice and formal consensus of his ministers. During the Song dynasty, a national examination system (Civil Service Exam) managed by scholar-bureaucrats was used to recruit officials; those who passed the palace examination – the highest-level examination in the empire – were appointed directly by the emperor to the highest central government positions. Like commoners, these senior officials had to obey his edicts as law or be punished. However, senior officials not only challenged the emperor over policy, but restrained him by invoking the ideal Confucian mores <b>and</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the literati gentry class from which they came.|$|E

South Africa has {{a complex}} {{financial}} and retail service industry with high {{reliance on the}} use of IT systems to ensure effectiveness and maintainability. Decision making and improved outcomes may be done through an IT aligned enterprise architecture (EA) strategy. EA is a capability that contributes to the support and success of an organisations' IT. Organisations are currently using EA to better align IT and the business strategy which provides a comprehensive v. ew of the IT system. Thus, EA is increasing in organisations yet the measurement <b>and</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> EA is limited to organisations and enterprise architects. The discussions <b>of</b> the benefits <b>and</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> EA has been discussed for several years, however there are still no consensus about how the benefits <b>and</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> EA can be measured. The lack and clear understanding <b>of</b> the benefits <b>and</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> EA needs to consider different aspects of IT as well as the shareholders when measuring the benefits <b>and</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> EA to an organisation...|$|R
