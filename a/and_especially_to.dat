A $62million proposal was presented in 2006, incorporating a museum and an underground carpark. Designed once again by Ashton Raggatt McDougall, the proposal was opposed by local residents and some council members, and ran into significant funding problems when the Federal Government decided not to provide funding.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{generally}} {{agree that}} a dramatic reduction in the overall size of the Congolese population occurred during the two-decades of Free State rule in the Congo. Populations always fluctuate over time and notable shifts, known as demographic crises, are well-attested in pre-industrial societies. Noted examples include the Spanish colonisation of the Americas. It is argued that {{the reduction in the}} Congo was atypical and {{can be attributed to the}} direct and indirect effects of colonial rule <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>to</b> disease and falling birthrate. Estimates of the size of the overall population decline (or mortality displacement) remain disputed but range between two and 13 million.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, <b>and</b> <b>especially,</b> <b>to</b> doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate ab initio, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E
5|$|When {{placed over}} a flame, lithium {{compounds}} give off a striking crimson color, {{but when it}} burns strongly the flame becomes a brilliant silver. Lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapors. Lithium is flammable, and it is potentially explosive when exposed to air <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>to</b> water, though less so than the other alkali metals. The lithium-water reaction at normal temperatures is brisk but nonviolent because the hydrogen produced does not ignite on its own. As with all alkali metals, lithium fires are difficult to extinguish, requiring dry powder fire extinguishers (Class D type). Lithium {{is one of the}} few metals that react with nitrogen under normal conditions.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{pressure}} of the events that led to the Mineriads, his political stance has veered with time: from a proponent of Perestroika, Iliescu recast himself as a Western European social democrat. The main debate around the subject of his commitment to such ideals is linked to the special conditions in Romania, <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>to</b> the strong nationalist and autarkic attitude visible within the Ceaușescu regime. Critics have pointed out that, unlike most communist-to-social democrat changes in the Eastern bloc, Romania's tended to retain various cornerstones.|$|E
