The Spartans {{apparently}} used a tactic of feigning retreat, and then turning and killing the enemy troops when they ran after them.|$|E
5|$|After {{multiple}} years <b>and</b> <b>failed</b> petitions, Mother 3 was reannounced for the Game Boy Advance in 2003 {{within a}} Japanese television commercial for Mother 1+2, a port of Mother and Mother 2 to the Advance. The game kept its original story {{and received a}} graphical overhaul in a pixelated style similar to Mother 2. The game's themes included human physiology, renewal, and fungibility on the morality spectrum. Its music was composed by Shogo Sakai, and retained the quirky style of series composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. Mother 3 was released on April 20, 2006 in Japan, whereupon it became a bestseller. It has not been released outside Japan.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{was stopped}} at Kőszeg <b>and</b> <b>failed</b> to conquer Vienna, Suleiman {{additionally}} secured his possession in Hungary by conquering several forts, since Ferdinand and Charles evaded {{an open field}} battle. Immediately after the Ottoman withdrawal, Ferdinand reoccupied devastated territory in Austria and Hungary. Nevertheless, Suleiman concluded a peace treaty with Ferdinand in 1533, in Constantinople. The treaty confirmed the right of John Zápolya as a king of all Hungary, but recognised Ferdinand's possession of {{that part of the}} country that enjoyed the status quo.|$|E
5|$|Although several German states {{initially}} {{sided with}} Austria, they {{stayed on the}} defensive <b>and</b> <b>failed</b> to take effective initiatives against Prussian troops. The Austrian army therefore faced the technologically superior Prussian army with support only from Saxony. France promised aid, but it came late and was insufficient. Complicating the situation for Austria, the Italian mobilization on Austria's southern border required a diversion of forces away from battle with Prussia to fight the Third Italian War of Independence on a second front in Venetia and on the Adriatic sea. The day-long Battle of Königgrätz, {{near the village of}} Sadová, gave Prussia an uncontested and decisive victory.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the fourth quarter, Georgia Tech was in possession of the ball, deep inside Wake Forest territory. Shortly after the quarter began, Tech failed to gain a needed first down in order to continue its drive. Instead of attempting to convert the fourth down—Tech had attempted <b>and</b> <b>failed</b> on two fourth-down conversions in the third quarter—Tech instead sent in kicker Travis Bell. Bell's 34-yard attempt sailed through the goalposts, and with 12:53 remaining in the game, Georgia Tech took a 63 lead.|$|E

He finished fourth in his heat of the 110 metre hurdles <b>and</b> <b>failed</b> to progress but won his 400-metre heat before finishing fifth in the semi final. Kent Hughes {{did not return to}} England empty handed, as he later admitted to souveniring an official Olympic flag from the Olympic stadium.|$|E
5|$|Back on Guam, Hubbard {{spent much}} of his time writing dozens of short stories and essays <b>and</b> <b>failed</b> the Naval Academy {{entrance}} examination. In September 1929 Hubbard was enrolled at the Swavely Preparatory School in Manassas, Virginia, to prepare him for a second attempt at the examination. However, he was ruled out of consideration due to his near-sightedness. He was instead sent to Woodward School for Boys in Washington, D.C. to qualify for admission to George Washington University. He successfully graduated from the school in June 1930 and entered the university the following September.|$|E
5|$|Bombing of Normandy began {{around midnight}} {{with more than}} 2,200 British, Canadian, and American bombers attacking targets along the coast and further inland. The coastal bombing attack was largely {{ineffective}} at Omaha, because low cloud cover made the assigned targets difficult to see. Concerned about inflicting casualties on their own troops, many bombers delayed their attacks too long <b>and</b> <b>failed</b> to hit the beach defences. The Germans had 570 aircraft stationed in Normandy and the Low Countries on D-Day, and another 964 in Germany.|$|E
