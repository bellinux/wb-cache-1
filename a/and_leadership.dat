40|$|This {{study was}} {{completed}} using {{a sample of}} online students at a university in North Texas. The study explored leadership style as a predictor in students' ratings of overall teaching effectiveness, learning, breadth, examinations, and assignments. A Pearson product-moment correlation was conducted to examine the inter-correlations between the leadership styles, the inter-correlations between the four SEEQ factors of Learning, Breadth, Examinations, and Assignments, {{and the relationship between}} the four SEEQ factors <b>and</b> the <b>leadership</b> styles. Transformational leadership was highly correlated with transactional <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> passive avoidant <b>leadership</b> style was negatively correlated with transactional <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> transformational <b>leadership.</b> The inter-correlation of the SEEQ factors showed that the four factors were highly correlated. Learning <b>and</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> were positively correlated. Breadth <b>and</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> were positively correlated. Examinations <b>and</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> were positively correlated. Assignments <b>and</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> were positively correlated.

The aim {{is to examine the}} impact servant <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> for the succeed of corporate social responsibility. The population of this research is all pastors of GKPMI. And the sample is 8 pastors from this church. This research used qualitative analysis, using the interview and observation techniques.

40|$|The author {{intended}} {{to examine the}} effects of authentic <b>leadership,</b> transformational <b>leadership,</b> <b>and</b> transactional <b>leadership</b> on follower moral identity and follower moral decision intention, and the influence processes through which authentic <b>leadership,</b> transformational <b>leadership,</b> <b>and</b> transactional <b>leadership</b> impacts follower moral decision intention. More specifically, the author tested whether follower moral identity mediates the effect of authentic <b>and</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> on follower moral decision intention and whether moral intensity moderates the effect of authentic <b>leadership,</b> transformational <b>leadership,</b> <b>and</b> transactional <b>leadership</b> on follower moral decision intention. ^ Based on three pilot tests with undergraduate samples and one experimental study with a real field sample (i. e., teachers in public settings), it was found that authentic <b>and</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> has a positive effect on follower moral identity and follower moral decision intention. Moreover, it was also found that follower moral identity mediates the effects of both authentic <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> on follower moral decision intention. Contrary to the expectation, transactional leadership had a negative effect on follower moral decision intention. Furthermore, moral intensity moderated the effect of authentic <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> on follower moral decision intention in that the effects of authentic <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> on follower moral decision intention are stronger when moral intensity is low. ^ This study has a number of theoretical contributions and practical implications. This study made a significant theoretical contribution to both the <b>leadership</b> area <b>and</b> the ethical decision making field in that it has introduced a testable theoretical model to explain how authentic <b>and</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> affects follower moral identity and moral decision intention. This study also made a significant theoretical contribution to the moral development field in that it took the leadership factor into account and generalized to working adults in organizations. One unique practical implication is that, in order to promote follower moral decision intention, it is necessary to promote follower moral identity. Another important practical implication is that organizations need to develop authentic <b>and</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> across different organizational levels in order to develop follower moral identity and follower moral decision intention, which could help pave the way for an organization 2 ̆ 7 s sustainable development. ...|$|R
