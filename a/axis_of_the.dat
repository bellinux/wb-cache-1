5|$|Early in 1985 the Southern <b>Axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SPLA under Major Arok Thon Arok {{challenged}} {{government forces}} in Southern Upper Nile, Eastern Equatoria and Central Equatoria.

5|$|The head is {{enclosed}} in a hard, heavily sclerotized, unsegmented, exoskeletal head capsule, or epicranium, which contains {{most of the}} sensing organs, including the antennae, ocellus or eyes, and the mouthparts. Of all the insect orders, Orthoptera displays the most features found in other insects, including the sutures and sclerites. Here, the vertex, or the apex (dorsal region), is situated between the compound eyes for insects with a hypognathous and opisthognathous head. In prognathous insects, the vertex is not found between the compound eyes, but rather, where the ocelli are normally. This is because the primary <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head is rotated 90° to become parallel to the primary <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. In some species, this region is modified and assumes a different name.|$|E

5|$|A {{network of}} tunnels exists under the prison, built {{to provide the}} prison, and later the town of Fremantle, with a supply of fresh water. Other {{elements}} of the site include the hospital building, prisoner workshops, open spaces, and a limestone ramp on the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gatehouse, heading down towards the port area of Fremantle. Archaeological zones and sub-surface remains of varying levels of significance are found throughout {{the area of the}} convict grant.|$|E
5|$|Although {{both sides}} claimed victory, neither {{achieved}} all their objectives; the JNA garrison evacuated the Logorište barracks, but Croatian defences elsewhere held. Particularly heavy fighting {{was reported in}} the Karlovac suburb of Turanj, identified as the primary <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> JNA effort. While the JNA removed some weapons and equipment stored in the Logorište barracks, the remaining supplies were removed by the ZNG over a one-week period after the battle.|$|E

5|$|Associated with jet streams is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear-air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear caused by jet streams. The CAT is strongest on the cold air side of the jet, next to and just under the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jet. Clear-air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents, such as {{the death of one}} passenger on United Airlines Flight 826.|$|E
5|$|By September 1993, CANBAT 1 was {{relocated}} from Sector West to Sector South (northern Dalmatia and Lika). The UNPFROFOR mandate in Croatia expired on 31 March 1995, and the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 981 {{establishing the}} United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO) instead. Sector West {{was captured by}} the HV in Operation Flash in early May 1995, with no resistance from UN peacekeepers. The main <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first day's HV advance was the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway, as anticipated by the planners of Operation Backstop.|$|E
5|$|By the evening, the 2nd Battalion {{was ordered}} to {{separate}} from the main <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> offensive and protect the right flank of the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Brigadeperforming the task originally assigned to the 10th Brigade of the Croatian TO. At the same time, the 10th Brigade commanding officer was relieved of duty for failure to advance. Regardless, the unit remained inactive. The HV units that managed to cross the river on 12 December surprised the JNA and reported inflicting considerable casualties.|$|E

5|$|Ida's {{rotation}} period is 4.63 hours, {{making it one}} of the fastest rotating asteroids yet discovered. The calculated maximum moment of inertia of a uniformly dense object the same shape as Ida coincides with the spin <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> asteroid. This suggests that there are no major variations of density within the asteroid. Ida's axis of rotation precesses with a period of 77 thousand years, due to the gravity of the Sun acting upon the nonspherical shape of the asteroid.|$|E
5|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} {{are most often}} caused by physical trauma. Forces involved can be hyperflexion (forward movement of the head); hyperextension (backward movement); lateral stress (sideways movement); rotation (twisting of the head); compression (force along the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spine downward from the head or upward from the pelvis); or distraction (pulling apart of the vertebrae). Traumatic SCI can result in contusion, compression, or stretch injury. It is a major risk of many types of vertebral fracture. Pre-existing asymptomatic congenital anomalies can cause major neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis, to result from otherwise minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian Serb TO and JNA defences {{immediately}} west of {{the city}} of Sisak and north of Glina were positioned along the right (southern) bank of the Kupa River, largely consisting of the JNA 592nd and the 622nd Mechanised Brigades. On the opposite bank, the HV 100th Infantry Brigade held positions west of Sisak, flanked by the 145th Infantry Brigade to its right, and the 10th brigade of the Croatian TO further to the west.

5|$|The dentary (lower jaw bone) {{itself is}} robust and short. The length <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> p4 makes an angle of about 58° with the length <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jawbone. The bone is concave on the lingual, but convex on the labial side. There is a {{diastema}} (gap) between the p4 and the incisor {{that would have}} been in front of it, as in the jaw of Sudamerica. Gurovich estimated the length of the diastema as 2.5mm. There is a rounded mental foramen (an opening in the labial side of the jawbone), with a diameter of 0.7mm, located about 0.8mm below the dorsal margin of the bone and 1.5mm in front of the p4. Although the incisor itself is not preserved, its alveolus (the housing of the root) is in part. As in Sudamerica, it extends far into the dentary, passing below p4. The alveolus is 1.5mm wide below the front root of p4 and 1.4mm {{at the back of the}} jaw fragment. Although the height of the alveolus cannot be determined because the lower side is broken away, the incisor must have been quite deep.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} {{revealed that}} {{the location of the}} stones was not their original prehistoric position. The original location of the circle was identified as existing a few feet to the west, under the adjacent hedge. The original circle had either eight or possibly nine sockets for stones and was oval shaped. The perimeter of the ring was defined by V-shaped ditches on its eastern and western perimeters. The maximum <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle would have been approximately 20 feet (6.5 metres), making it considerably smaller than the size proposed by the Piggotts.|$|E

5|$|Veratalpa lugdunensiana is {{a fossil}} mammal from the Miocene of France.

He placed it in Talpidae, {{the family of the}} moles, but in 1974, John Howard Hutchison argued that the astragalus was not talpid and more likely came from a rodent. The astragalus is about 4.5mm long, broad for a talpid, and has the head oriented farther from the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot than in talpids.|$|E
5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa, on September7. The system passed south of Cape Verde on September8, with disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Around that time, the National Hurricane Center gave the system a medium chance of tropical cyclogenesis within 48hours. A low pressure area developed along the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tropical wave on September9, which caused convective activity to increase further. The system was assessed with a high chance for tropical cyclone formation on September10. Based on satellite intensity estimates, the National Hurricane Center declared the disturbance as Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200UTC on September10, while located about 885miles (1,425km) west of Cape Verde.|$|E
