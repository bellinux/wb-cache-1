The project examined 30-day work histories of locomotive crews prior to 400 human <b>factors</b> <b>accidents</b> and 1000 nonhuman <b>factors</b> <b>accidents.</b> SAFTE estimated crew effectiveness (the inverse of fatigue) based entirely on work schedule information and opportunities to obtain sleep. Over 1 million 30-min work intervals were evaluated {{based on data from}} five US freight railroads. A reliable linear relationship existed between crew effectiveness and the risk of human <b>factors</b> <b>accidents</b> (r = - 0.93), but not for non-human <b>factors</b> <b>accidents.</b> The risk of human <b>factors</b> <b>accidents</b> was elevated at effectiveness scores below 90 and increased progressively with reduced effectiveness. At an effectiveness score ≤ 50, human <b>factors</b> <b>accidents</b> were 65 percent more likely than chance. Below an effectiveness score of 70, accident cause codes indicated the kinds of operator errors consistent with fatigue, confirming that the relationship between accident risk and effectiveness was meaningful. Further analysis indicated that SAFTE/FAST also predicted an increase in <b>accident</b> severity; human <b>factors</b> <b>accidents</b> that occurred when average effectiveness was calculated to be less than 77 were 2½ times more costly than similar accidents that occurred when effectiveness was greater than 90.|$|R

Road accident is a special case of trauma that constitutes {{a major cause of}} disability, untimely death and loss of loved ones as well as family bread winners. Therefore, methods to reduce accident severity are of great interest to traffic agencies and the public at large.

40|$|Very little {{research}} has focussed on inexperienced pilots {{and there is a}} notion in literature and popular texts that such pilots are one of the safest groups. Despite this, ‘early-solo’ UK glider pilots were found to have a higher accident rate than any other group. Research was conducted in order to investigate the issues surrounding this. It was identified that accidents sustained by these pilots tended to be initiated by events in the approach and landing phases of fight, and caused by misjudgement of the approach path and landing flare. Most accidents to more experienced pilots were found to be different in all respects. It was subsequently found that instructors believed the highest accident likelihood to be associated with more experience pilots, in line with literature. It was also found that instructors wrongly believed that the ‘approach’ phase was the least likely in-flight phase to be associated with accident causes for low-hours pilots. Critical Incident Technique was used to investigate instructor decisions with regard to sending pilots solo. An initial model of the decision process was put forward. It was found that, with one critical exception, when events occurred on assessment flights that were similar to causal <b>accident</b> <b>factors</b> (from the <b>accident</b> analysis), instructors disallowed solo flight. An absence of potential <b>accident</b> <b>factors</b> was apparently insufficient to allow solo flight by itself; instructors required further evidence in order to confirm that students were ready to fly alone. Exceptionally, pilot performance in terms of the approach path {{did not appear to be}} a critical factor when instructors considered disallowing solo flight, highlighting a possible gap in the instructor decision process. It was recommended that further research be conducted to validate and extend the decision model, and that the approach phase be focussed upon more in both training and assessment.
