5|$|Columbus Crew and Toronto FC have {{competed for}} the Trillium Cup since 2008. Although a {{manufactured}} rivalry, the meetings have since sparked bitterness. On March 28, 2009, approximately 1,700 Toronto FC supporters travelled to Columbus Crew Stadium <b>and</b> <b>witnessed</b> a 1–1 draw, {{during which they}} lit a number of flares and allegedly committed vandalism.

The delays left only two days for printing the film and sending it to theatres, generating significant anxiety over a possible delay in the release. Khan subsequently kept strict tabs on the progress of work, and postponed his knee surgery to complete the film on time.|$|E

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how Bruce was employed {{after his return}} from Spitsbergen in autumn 1899. In his whole life he rarely had settled salaried work, and usually relied on patronage or on influential acquaintances to find him temporary posts. Early in 1901 he evidently felt sufficiently confident of his prospects to get married. His bride was Jessie Mackenzie, who {{had worked as a}} nurse in Samuel Bruce's London surgery. Bruce's marriage took place in the United Free Church of Scotland, in Chapelhill within the Parish of Nigg on 20 January 1901, being attended <b>and</b> <b>witnessed</b> by their parents. Perhaps, due to Bruce's secretive nature presenting limited details even among his circle of close friends and colleagues, little information about the wedding has been recorded by his biographers.|$|E
