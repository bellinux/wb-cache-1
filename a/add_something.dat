Wanting to <b>add</b> <b>something</b> different to the script, he later decided to introduce homosexuality (which he thought was unexplored by Bollywood) {{to shed light on}} the issue for the Indian audience. Manish Malhotra designed Chopra's costumes, and Aki Narula designed costumes {{for the rest of the}} cast. The soundtrack was composed by Vishal–Shekhar and Anvita Dutt Guptan; Kumaar and Vishal Dadlani wrote its lyrics.|$|E

Fortunato Prandi who acted as interpreter in Turin was an Italian exile and follower of Giuseppe Mazzini.|$|E

[...] "Soul Singing" [...] was the only song to cause disagreement; [...] "I'd written this part where {{although}} the vocals changed the music stayed the same throughout. [...] I thought we should <b>add</b> <b>something</b> or just not finish it, but Chris thought it was already a song, and a good one. [...] So we talked about that one for a while", Rich recalled.|$|E
500|$|The final {{track of}} the DVD, [...] "Raining Blood", culminates with the band drenched by stage blood. Guitarist Jeff Hanneman {{came up with the}} idea of the blood two years after Reign in Bloods release, but the band lacked the funding to do so. The {{beginning}} of the film Blade (released in 1998) features a [...] "bloodbath" [...] with vampires dancing in a club with blood coming from the roof via a sprinkler system. The scene revived Jeff Hanneman and guitarist Kerry King's interest, and since the band released a DVD the previous year [...] War at the Warfield [...] they decided to <b>add</b> <b>something</b> different for the new DVD [...] raining blood. King asserted that since Lombardo was not on the previous DVD, this one was going to be important. Due to the short length of the DVD, director Dean Karr chose an additional bonus six songs from the same show as he thought certain members excelled in the performances.|$|E
500|$|Kelly was {{released}} from the military after two years, following which he worked on and off with Washington and Gillespie again. Kelly was also part of Charles Mingus' group for a tour of Washington, D.C., California, and Vancouver in late 1956 to early 1957. He left Mingus to rejoin Gillespie, who led a big band that toured Canada and the southern United States. Commenting on Kelly's ability to move from a small group to a big band setting, saxophonist Benny Golson, also from Gillespie's band, said that [...] "He kept his identity; yet he was able to <b>add</b> <b>something</b> to the band, not only melodically (which he was known for) but rhythmically. He would set up patterns – never interfering with the arrangement, but he was able to get into the cracks and he would always be adding something, giving it impetus, more energy." [...] In 1956, Kelly recorded with vocalist Billie Holiday, including for the original version of her song [...] "Lady Sings the Blues", {{as well as for the}} Blue Note debuts of saxophonists Johnny Griffin and Sonny Rollins. After leaving Gillespie again, Kelly formed his own trio.|$|E

500|$|Marlborough was ruthlessly ambitious, {{relentless}} in {{the pursuit}} of wealth, power and social advancement, earning him a reputation for avarice and miserliness. These traits may have been exaggerated for the purposes of party faction but, notes Trevelyan, nearly all other statesmen of the day were engaged in founding families and amassing estates at the public expense; Marlborough only differed in that he gave the public much more value for their money. In his quest for fame and personal interests he could be unscrupulous, as his desertion of JamesII testifies. To Macaulay this is regarded as a piece of selfish treachery against his patron; an analysis shared by the historian G. K. Chesterton: [...] "Churchill, as if to <b>add</b> <b>something</b> ideal to his imitation of Iscariot, went to James with wanton professions of love and loyalty... and then calmly handed over the army to the invader". To Trevelyan, Marlborough's behaviour during the 1688 revolution was a sign of his [...] "devotion to the liberties of England and the Protestant religion". However, his continuing correspondence with Saint-Germain was not noble. Although Marlborough did not wish for a Jacobite restoration his double-dealing ensured that WilliamIII and GeorgeI would never be fully disposed to trust him.|$|E
500|$|Much of Kim Possibles cast {{consists}} of Disney Channel and ABC alumnae, {{as well as}} actors known for their roles on other popular animated and comedy series. The lead role of Kim was originally offered to Anneliese van der Pol, who declined in favor of appearing as Chelsea Daniels on the Disney Channel teen sitcom That's So Raven. After auditioning several actresses to voice the title character, then-16 year-old Christy Carlson Romano was finally cast as Kim after first being introduced to Schooley and McCorkle by Disney Channel executives. Romano had already been well known to Disney Channel audiences for her portrayal of Ren Stevens on the series Even Stevens, and began voicing Kim while completing her stint on the show. Her first voice acting role, Romano immediately identified with her character because both were [...] "dealing with teenage issues" [...] at the same time, comparing Kim's challenge of battling both her personal life and villains to herself balancing schoolwork with her budding acting career; the actress was forced to forfeit her own senior prom due to Kim Possible commitments. Describing her character as [...] "very ambitious, very skilled, very smart," [...] Romano told The New York Times [...] "I've tried to make her a good role model. Her confidence and her sincerity really shine through." [...] One episode in particular, [...] "Blush", was inspired by Romano's modesty and tendency to blush at the slightest compliment. Romano's performance as Kim was nominated for an Emmy Award. Recognized {{for his ability to}} play [...] "over-the-top characters", Will Friedle, best remembered for his performance as Eric Matthews on the sitcom Boy Meets World, was cast as Ron. Actor Neil Patrick Harris had auditioned for the role, as did actor John Cena before he decided to pursue a professional wrestling career. Schooley attributes much of the show's success to Romano and Friedle's chemistry, explaining, [...] "they <b>add</b> <b>something</b> to this that makes it more than a typical gag-oriented cartoon." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the game}} was more free-form, {{allowing}} players to purchase new powers at any point during the game, but the developers {{found it difficult to}} create a challenging game on that basis, particularly as they could not design missions calling for specific powers that the player may not have at that time. This evolved into the scheme of presenting new powers to the player {{over the course of the}} game, with the developers created guiding rules for which powers were ultimately included in the game and when: the power had to be useful and <b>add</b> <b>something</b> unique to the game, the player would need a chance to use that power immediately after they got it, and the power would need to be enjoyable to use. The team employed frequent reviews of when these powers were introduced to the player as other gameplay elements were added to the game. Not all powers were necessarily offensive; the [...] "postcognition" [...] power, allowing the player to see the psychic echo of a dead person of where they were before their death, was added as the team found there was an element of fun in tracking the echo through the crowded city. Some powers were cut from the game. One power, gained through the Evil karma path, was called [...] "Minionize", and would have allowed Cole to control the minds of civilians and force them to join him in battle. Although the power was [...] "decidedly evil and very fun to watch", the team felt it wasn't useful to the game, though they managed to retain a hint of it in one of the Evil side missions. Though the team had tested each of the core missions individually with the powers that the player would have based on the game's storyboard, they found that play-testers, who played the missions back-to-back, found the game lacked a variety of combat situations. The developers revisited all the combat scenarios from this feedback to alter the combat layouts as well as adding new enemies, a step that Bridges believes the game [...] "benefited greatly" [...] from. The ability to use Cole's electrical powers to ride along Empire City's elevated train rails was a last-minute addition during the last month of development based on a play-tester's suggestion.|$|E

2500|$|In The Naked Sun, Elijah Baley {{points out}} that the Laws had been {{deliberately}} misrepresented because robots could unknowingly break any of them. He restated the first law as [...] "A robot may do nothing that, to its knowledge, will harm a human being; nor, through inaction, knowingly allow a human being to come to harm." [...] This change in wording makes it clear that robots can become the tools of murder, provided they not be aware of the nature of their tasks; for instance being ordered to <b>add</b> <b>something</b> to a person's food, not knowing that it is poison. Furthermore, he {{points out that}} a clever criminal could divide a task among multiple robots so that no individual robot could recognize that its actions would lead to harming a human being. The Naked Sun complicates the issue by portraying a decentralized, planetwide communication network among Solaria's millions of robots meaning that the criminal mastermind could be located anywhere on the planet.|$|E
2500|$|The letters [...] and [...] were {{originally}} simply known as [...] and , which in modern Spanish are pronounced identically.

Some Mexicans and most Peruvians generally say [...] / [...] ('big B' / 'little V'); Argentines, Uruguayans and Chileans, be [...] / [...] ('long B' / 'short V').

2500|$|Thomas Aquinas {{criticized the}} {{argument}} for proposing a definition of God which, if God is transcendent, should be impossible for humans. Immanuel Kant criticized the proof from a logical standpoint: he stated that the term [...] "God" [...] really signifies two different terms: both idea of God, and God. Kant concluded that the proof is equivocation, based on the ambiguity of the word God. Kant also challenged the argument's assumption that existence is a predicate (of perfection) {{because it does not}} add anything to the essence of a being. If existence is not a predicate, then it is not necessarily true that the greatest possible being exists. A common rebuttal to Kant's critique is that, although [...] "existence" [...] does <b>add</b> <b>something</b> to both the concept and the reality of God, the concept would be vastly different if its referent is an unreal Being. Another response to Kant is attributed to Alvin Plantinga who explains that even if one were to grant Kant that [...] "existence" [...] is not a real predicate, [...] "Necessary Existence", which is the correct formulation of an understanding of God, is a real predicate, thus according to Plantinga Kant's argument is refuted.|$|E
