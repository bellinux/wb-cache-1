Despite Scully's pleading, Mulder pulls the trigger first at Modell and then himself, the hammer falling on an empty chamber both times. Modell then makes him aim the gun at Scully. At the last instant, Scully sees a fire alarm in a mirror and pulls it in desperation, breaking Modell's concentration. Mulder instantly switches his aim to Modell <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> trigger; the bullet is fired and Modell is severely wounded.|$|E
5|$|Becoming irritated {{that no one}} {{joined in}} him in walking out on Gabe, Michael goes outside <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> cable connection, causing it to turn off. Hysteria erupts, and Michael becomes {{self-conscious}} over the commotion he has caused. He goes outside to fix the cable. There he is discovered by Erin, who throughout the evening {{has been trying to}} encourage Michael to bond with Gabe. Michael, still indignant over the idea that his office views Gabe as his boss, is initially irritated by her efforts, but eventually realizes that Erin views him as a father figure. He jokes around and tells her to go to her room, leading to a bonding moment between the two. As he leaves the party, Michael brings Gabe into the joke by threatening to kill him if he breaks Erin's heart.|$|E
5|$|In an {{underwater}} facility, {{a team of}} scientists is doing research on mako sharks to help in the re-activation of dormant human brain cells like those found in Alzheimer's disease patients. After one of their sharks escapes the facility and attempts to attack a boat full of teenagers, financial backers send corporate executive Russell Franklin to investigate the facility. In the laboratory, doctors Susan McAlester and Jim Whitlock prove their research is working by testing a certain protein complex that was removed from the brain tissue of their largest shark. However, Jim's right arm is bitten off by the animal shortly afterwards. Brenda Kerns, the tower's operator, calls a helicopter to evacuate Jim, but as he is being lifted, the stormy weather causes Jim to fall into the shark pen. The shark then grabs Jim's stretcher <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> helicopter into the tower, killing Brenda and the pilots.|$|E

25|$|They {{find that}} a large party has {{assembled}} at his home and that the champagne is already flowing. Present are Lebedyev, his daughter Vera, Ippolit, Burdovsky, Kolya, General Ivolgin, Ganya, Ptitsyn, Ferdyschenko, Keller, and, to Myshkin's surprise, Yevgeny Pavlovich, who has come to ask for his friendship and advice. The guests greet the Prince warmly and compete for his attention. Stimulated by Lebedyev's eloquence, everyone engages for some time in intelligent and inebriated disputation on lofty subjects, but the good-humoured atmosphere begins to dissipate when Ippolit suddenly produces a large red-sealed envelope and announces that it contains an essay he has written which he now intends to read to them. The essay {{is a series of}} verbose psychological observations on the subject of his own approaching death, written in a defiant, self-conscious style, and culminating in the announcement that, rather than go on living for a few more weeks, he will be shooting himself at sunrise. The reading drags on for over an hour and by its end, the sun has risen. Most of his audience, however, is bored and resentful, apparently not at all concerned that he is about to shoot himself. Only Vera, Kolya, Burdovsky and Keller seek to restrain him. He distracts them by pretending to abandon the plan, then suddenly pulls out a small pistol, puts it to his temple <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> trigger. There is a click but no shot: Ippolit faints but is not killed. It turns out, to the great amusement of some, that he had taken out the cap earlier and forgotten to put it back in. Ippolit is devastated and tries desperately to convince everyone that it was an accident. Eventually, he falls asleep and the party disperses.|$|E
500|$|The {{second type}} of prey capture {{behavior}} is [...] "creeping", used by the ray for stationary or slow-moving prey; this includes stunned prey that may have drifted out of reach from a jumping attack. In creeping, the ray makes small up and down motions of its disc coupled with small beats of its tail. The raising of the disc draws water beneath it <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> prey towards the ray, while the lowering of the disc and the tail beats move the ray towards the prey in small increments. When it reaches the prey, the ray opens its mouth to suck it in. Short electric bursts are produced as necessary, depending on {{the movement of the}} prey, and continue through ingestion.|$|E

500|$|In dinosaurs, {{the most}} {{important}} locomotor muscle was located in the tail. This muscle, called caudofemoralis, attaches to the fourth trochanter, a prominent ridge on the thigh bone, <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> thigh bone backwards when contracted. Scott Persons and Phil Currie (2011) note that in the tail vertebrae of Carnotaurus the caudal ribs did not protrude horizontally ("T-shaped"), but were angled against the vertical axis of the vertebrae, forming a [...] "V". This would have provided additional space for a caudofemoralis muscle larger {{than in any other}} theropod—the muscle mass was calculated at [...] per leg. Therefore, Carnotaurus could {{have been one of the}} fastest large theropods. While the caudofemoralis muscle was enlarged, the epaxial muscles situated above the caudal ribs would have been proportionally smaller. These muscles, called the longissimus and spinalis muscle, were responsible for tail movement and stability. To maintain tail stability in spite of reduction of these muscles, the caudal ribs bear forward projecting processes interlocking the vertebrae with each other and with the pelvis, stiffening the tail. As a consequence, the ability to make tight turns would have been diminished, because the hip and tail had to be turned simultaneously, unlike in other theropods.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes and Joe then {{reconcile}} and get engaged. On Mercedes' hen night, however, she {{is arrested}} along with Cindy and Tegan Lomax (Jessica Ellis) following a catfight. While {{at the police}} station, Mercedes' lawyer, Joanne Cardsley (Rachel Leskovac), plants drugs in Mercedes' handbag {{in an attempt to}} ruin her relationship with Joe because of her own obsession with him. Mercedes spends the night in a cell and is released on her wedding day. At the wedding, Mercedes is devastated when Joe does not arrive. She confronts him and he admits that he cannot be with her after hearing about her arrest as he believes she is not an appropriate mother figure for his children and refuses to believe that Mercedes is innocent. He also admits to having a one-night stand with Joanne. Mercedes is furious and is even more angry when she sees Joe and Joanne together later that day. As a result, she crashes a car in to the restaurant and vows revenge on both of them. Joe and Joanne eventually begin a relationship, however the police later discover that the drugs didn't belong to Mercedes, and she realises that Joanne set her up. Joe realises Joanne's deceit and breaks up with her. At the [...] "Halloween Spooktacular", Joe plans to propose to Mercedes on the ferris wheel in order to win her back. Mercedes discovers Joe's plan and decides to embarrass him in front of everyone. While she is on the ferris wheel with Joe, she realises that she is still in love with him and forgives him. Joanne is furious when she sees Mercedes and Joe together, <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> brakes on the ferris wheel, leaving Joe and Mercedes stuck in the air. When a fire breaks out at the wooden maze, a rescue team arrive to save Mercedes and Joe. Mercedes is rescued from the wheel, an explosion caused by the fire rips through the funfair. As a result, Joe falls off the ferris wheel and plummets to his death after telling Mercedes he loves her.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{imperative}} (for road riding, at least) that the chain is sufficiently tight {{that it is}} impossible for it to derail from either the chainring or sprocket. [...] This generally equates to [...] "no visible slack". [...] A derailed chain can cause a variety of undesirable consequences, such as a locked rear wheel or, worst of all, destruction of the frame if the chain becomes caught around the crank arm <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> rear triangle forwards. [...] On a fixed-gear bicycle without hand brakes, even a relatively benign derailment means a total loss of braking ability. [...] Tensioning aside, a chain is significantly less likely to derail if the chainline is accurate and the chain is a traditional [...] "full bushing" [...] type with limited lateral flexibility. [...] Because the difference between a tight and a slack chain equates to only very minor elongation of the links, chain tension should be visually checked at least weekly, especially if the bicycle is ridden in wet or dirty conditions.|$|E

2500|$|Single block {{wire drawing}} {{machines}} include means for holding the dies accurately in position and for drawing the wire steadily through the holes. The usual design {{consists of a}} cast-iron bench or table having a bracket standing up to hold the die, and a vertical drum which rotates and by coiling the wire around its surface pulls it through the die, the coil of wire being stored upon another drum or [...] "swift" [...] which lies behind the die and reels off the wire as fast as required. The wire drum or [...] "block" [...] is provided with means for rapidly coupling or uncoupling it to its vertical shaft, so that {{the motion of the}} wire may be stopped or started instantly. The block is also tapered, so that the coil of wire may be easily slipped off upwards when finished. Before the wire can be attached to the block, a sufficient length of it must be pulled through the die; this is effected by a pair of gripping pincers {{on the end of a}} chain which is wound around a revolving drum, so drawing the wire until enough can be coiled two or three times on the block, where the end is secured by a small screw clamp or vice. When the wire is on the block, it is set in motion and the wire is drawn steadily through the die; it is very important that the block rotates evenly and that it runs true <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> wire at a constant velocity, otherwise [...] "snatching" [...] occurs which will weaken or even break the wire. The speeds at which wire is drawn vary greatly, according to the material and the amount of reduction.|$|E

A sensual version of [...] "Candy Shop" [...] is performed next with snippets of [...] "Erotica" [...] integrated into the number. After the song, Madonna moves into [...] "Human Nature" [...] while removing articles of clothing as shifting mirrors move around the stage.
