40|$|OBJECTIVES: In {{the last}} decade, {{increasing}} evidence suggests {{a key role}} of adenosine in Parkinson's disease (PD) and A 2 A adenosine receptors (<b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>ARs)</b> as <b>an</b> important pharmacological target in PD. An overexpression of <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>ARs</b> {{has been found in}} putamen and in peripheral blood cells of PD patients. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} verify whether the alterations in <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>ARs</b> in lymphocytes of PD subjects correlate with disease severity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A consecutive sample of PD patients was enrolled. A clinical examination and a face-to-face interview were carried out. <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>ARs</b> were investigated to verify the affinity and receptor density in lymphocyte membranes. The data were compared with those found in healthy controls. Moreover, the correlation between <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> density and affinity and clinical variables was evaluated in PD patients. RESULTS: In human lymphocyte membranes from PD patients, an increase in <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> density and <b>a</b> decrease in <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> affinity were found if compared with healthy subjects. A statistically significant correlation between the <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> density or affinity and specific clinical parameters as motor and cognitive impairment was detected.

We investigated A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> density and functionality in RA progression by using a longitudinal study in RA patients before and after methotrexate (MTX), anti-TNFα agents or rituximab treatments. A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>ARs</b> were analyzed by saturation binding assays in lymphocytes from RA patients throughout the 24 -month study timeframe. In an adjuvant-induced arthritis model in rats we showed the efficacy of the A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> agonist, CGS 21680 in comparison with standard therapies by means of paw volume assessment, radiographic and ultrasonographic imaging. Arthritic-associated pain was investigated in mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia tests. IL- 10 release following A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> stimulation in lymphocytes from RA patients and in serum from arthritic rats was measured. In lymphocytes obtained from RA patients, the A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> up-regulation was gradually reduced in function of the treatment time and the stimulation of these receptors mediated a significant increase of IL- 10 production. In the same cells, CGS 21680 did not affected cell viability and did not produced cytotoxic effects. The A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> agonist CGS 21680 was highly effective, as suggested by the marked reduction of clinical signs, in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis and associated pain.

We investigated whether <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> activation improves and <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> deletion worsens outcomes in a murine model of C. difficile (strain VPI 10463) infection (CDI). Methods C 57 BL/ 6 mice were pretreated with an antibiotic cocktail prior to infection and then treated with vancomycin with or without an <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> agonist. <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> -/- and littermate wild-type (WT) mice were similarly infected, and IFNγ and TNFα were measured at peak of and recovery from infection. Results Infected, untreated mice rapidly lost weight, developed diarrhea, and had mortality rates of 50 - 60 %. Infected mice treated with vancomycin had less weight loss and diarrhea during antibiotic treatment but mortality increased to near 100 % after discontinuation of antibiotics. Infected mice treated with both vancomycin and an <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> agonist, either ATL 370 or ATL 1222, had minimal weight loss and better long-term survival than mice treated with vancomycin alone. <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> KO mice were more susceptible than WT mice to death from CDI.

IOP was monitored {{for up to}} 32 minutes in A 3 -knockout (<b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ �) and <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � control mice by the servonull approach. The IOP responses to adenosine, <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> agonists and <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> antagonists were studied singly or in combination in both strains. RESULTS. IOP was significantly lower in <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � mice (12. 9 � 0. 7 mm Hg) than in <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � control animals (17. 4 � 0. 6 mm Hg). The nonselective AR agonist adenosine produced a much smaller increase in IOP (2. 2 � 0. 8 mm Hg) in the knockout than in <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � control mice (14. 9 � 2. 4 mm Hg). The A 3 -selective agonist IB-MECA did not affect IOP in A 3 -knockout mice, but raised it in <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � mice. The highly selective <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> antagonist MRS 1191 did not affect IOP in <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � mice, but lowered it in <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � control mice. Preadministering MRS 1191 {{did not affect the}} small adenosine-triggered increase in IOP in <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � mice, but markedly attenuated adenosine’s effects on IOP in <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � control mice. MRS 1523, <b>an</b> <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> antagonist less selective than MRS 1191 in rats, decreased IOP in both <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � and <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � animals.

40|$|A(2 A) {{adenosine}} receptor (A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR)</b> has potent anti-inflammatory properties, {{which may}} be important in the regulation of airway reactivity and inflammation.

Animals were sensitized intraperitoneally on days 1 and 6 with 200 microg of ragweed, followed by aerosolized challenges with 0. 5 % ragweed on days 11, 12, and 13, twice a day. On day 14, airway reactivity to methacholine was assessed as enhanced pause (Penh) using whole body plethysmography followed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung collection for various analyses. Allergen challenge caused a significant decrease in expression of A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> in A(2 <b>A)</b> WT sensitized mice, with A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> expression being undetected in A(2 A) KO sensitized group leading to decreased lung cAMP levels in both groups.

In the present study, we demonstrated {{for the first time that}} human platelets co-express <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>ARs</b> and D 2 DRs assembled into an heteromeric complexes. We also investigated the effects of chronic treatment with either typical or atypical antipsychotics on <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> binding parameters and receptors responsiveness in human platelets from patients affected by bipolar disorder. Chronic administration of typical antipsychotics induced a significant upregulation of <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> binding sites. Since no effects on <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> were obtained following "in vitro" platelet treatment with a typical antipsychotic (haloperidol), we could exclude a direct effect of the drug on <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> at the peripheral level. Moreover, typical antipsychotics induced a significant increase in the agonist potency to mediate A 2 A AR-G protein coupling. On the contrary, chronic treatment with atypical antipsychotics did not induce any significant alterations in <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> equilibrium binding parameters and receptor responsiveness suggesting that typical but not atypical antipsychotic drugs induced a selective modification of <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> binding parameters in human platelets.

This paper looks at a promising technology to mix real components (e. g. physical prototypes, assembly tools, machines, etc.) with virtual components to create <b>an</b> Augmented Reality (<b>AR)</b> interface for assembly process evaluation. The goal {{of this paper is}} to clarify the methodologies and enabling technologies of how to establish <b>an</b> <b>AR</b> assembly simulation and evaluation environment. The architecture of <b>an</b> <b>AR</b> assembly system is proposed and the important functional modules including AR environment set-up, design for assembly (DFA) analysis and AR assembly sequence planning in <b>an</b> <b>AR</b> environment are discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|The A 2 A {{adenosine}} receptor (<b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR)</b> is <b>a</b> key {{target for}} the development of pharmacological tools for the treatment of central nervous system disorders. Previous works have demonstrated that the insertion of substituents at various positions on adenine leads to <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> antagonists with affinity in the micromolar to nanomolar range. In this work, a series of 9 -ethyladenine derivatives bearing phenylalkylamino, phenylakyloxy or phenylakylthio groups of different lengths at the 2 -position were synthesised and tested against the human adenosine receptors. The derivatives showed sub-micromolar affinity for these membrane proteins. The further introduction of a bromine atom at the 8 -position has the effect of improving the affinity and selectivity for all ARs and led to compounds that are able bind to the <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> subtype at low nanomolar levels. Functional studies confirmed that the new adenine derivatives behave as <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> antagonists with half-maximal inhibitory concentration values in the nanomolar range. Molecular modelling studies provide a description of the possible binding mode of these compounds at the <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> and <b>an</b> interpretation of the affinity data at this AR subtype...|$|R
40|$|Adenosine {{increases}} coronary flow {{mainly through}} the activation of A 2 A and A 2 B adenosine receptors (ARs). However, the mechanisms for {{the regulation of}} coronary flow are not fully understood. We previously demonstrated that adenosine-induced increase in coronary flow is in part through NADPH oxidase (Nox) activation, which is independent of activation of either A 1 or <b>A</b> 3 <b>ARs.</b> In this study, we hypothesize that adenosine-mediated increase in coronary flow through Nox activation depends on A 2 A but not <b>A</b> 2 B <b>ARs.</b> Functional studies were conducted using isolated Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) production was measured in isolated coronary arteries from WT, <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> knockout (KO), and <b>A</b> 2 B <b>AR</b> KO mice using dichlorofluorescein immunofluorescence. Adenosine-induced concentration-dependent increase in coronary flow was attenuated by the specific Nox 2 inhibitor gp 91 ds-tat or reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger EUK 134 in both WT and A 2 B but not <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> KO isolated hearts. Similarly, the <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> selective agonist CGS- 21680 -induced increase in coronary flow was significantly blunted by Nox 2 inhibition in both WT and <b>A</b> 2 B <b>AR</b> KO, while the <b>A</b> 2 B <b>AR</b> selective agonist BAY 60 - 6583 -induced increase in coronary flow was not affected by Nox 2 inhibition in WT. In intact isolated coronary arteries, adenosine-induced (10  μM) increase in H 2 O 2 formation in both WT and <b>A</b> 2 B <b>AR</b> KO mice was attenuated by Nox 2 inhibition, whereas adenosine failed to increase H 2 O 2 production in <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> KO mice. In conclusion, adenosine-induced increase in coronary flow is partially mediated by Nox 2 -derived H 2 O 2, which critically depends upon the presence of <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of adenosine represents a critical endogenous mechanism for regulating immune and inflammatory responses during conditions of stress, injury, or infection. Adenosine exerts predominantly protective effects through activation of four 7 -transmembrane receptor subtypes termed A 1, A 2 A, A 2 B, and A 3, {{of which the}} A 2 A adenosine receptor (<b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR)</b> is recognised as a major mediator of anti-inflammatory responses. The <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> is widely expressed on cells {{of the immune system}} and numerous in vitro studies have identified its role in suppressing key stages of the inflammatory process, including leukocyte recruitment, phagocytosis, cytokine production, and immune cell proliferation. The majority of actions produced by <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> activation appear to be mediated by cAMP, but downstream events have not yet been well characterised. In this article, we review the current evidence for the anti-inflammatory effects of the <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> in different cell types and discuss possible molecular mechanisms mediating these effects, including the potential for generalised suppression of inflammatory gene expression through inhibition of the NF-κB and JAK/STAT proinflammatory signalling pathways. We also evaluate findings from in vivo studies investigating the role of the <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> in different tissues in animal models of inflammatory disease and briefly discuss the potential for development of selective <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> agonists for use in the clinic to treat specific inflammatory conditions...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Several {{studies have}} {{proposed}} a role for <b>a</b> 1 adrenoceptors (<b>ARs)</b> in ureteral physiology, indicating that they {{are present in the}} ureter; however, few studies have been done to identify <b>a</b> 1 <b>AR</b> subtypes present in this area. Thus, this study was carried out to characterize the <b>a</b> 1 <b>AR</b> subtype gene and protein expression in proximal, medial, and distal region of the human ureter. Methods: Molecular characterization of <b>a</b> 1 <b>AR</b> subtypes were analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. <b>a</b> 1 <b>AR</b> protein expression was studied by saturation binding curves and by competition binding curves with selective antagonists. Analysis of data was performed using the GraphPad PRISM 4 software. Results: Analysis of saturation binding curves revealed a heterogeneous distribution of <b>a</b> 1 <b>AR</b> binding sites, the Bmax for the distal ureter was indeed 52. 5 5. 4 fmol/mg prot, while a lower similar density of <b>a</b> 1 <b>ARs</b> was demonstrated in the medial (25. 2 1. 7 fmol/mg prot) and proximal (23. 4 0. 4 fmol/mg prot) ureters. Molecular and pharmacological characterization of <b>a</b> 1 <b>AR</b> subtypes indicated that each receptor was present, although with di¡erences in terms of the amount expressed. Conclusions: Human ureter was endowed with each <b>a</b> 1 <b>AR</b> subtype, although <b>a</b> 1 D and <b>a</b> 1 <b>A</b> <b>ARs</b> were prevalent over <b>a</b> 1 B <b>ARs.</b> Radioligand binding results revealed that there were no signi¢cant di¡erences in the Kd between ureteral regions, while a heterogeneous distribution of <b>a</b> 1 <b>AR</b> binding sites was detected, with the highest density of <b>a</b> 1 <b>ARs</b> in the distal ureter and a lower similar density in the medial and proximal ureters...|$|R

40|$|Replacement of a {{threonine}} by a lysine {{at position}} 373 in the C-terminal {{portion of the}} third intracellular loop of the human α 2 A-adrenergic receptor (α 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR)</b> {{has been reported to}} generate a constitutively active mutant receptor in analogy with similar mutations in the α 1 B and β 2 AR (Ren et al., 1993). In the present study, the mutant Thr 373 Lys α 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> receptor was investigated by measuring the formation of inositol phosphates in either the absence or presence of mouse Gα 15 protein in Cos- 7 cells. Increased affinity, potency and/or efficacy for the agonists [(−) -adrenaline, UK 14304, clonidine, guanabenz and oxymetazoline] was observed, consistent with a precoupled mutant α 2 A AR: G-protein state. The basal inositol phosphates response was similar at the wild-type (wt) and mutant α 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR,</b> but was enhanced at the mutant α 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> upon co-expression with the mouse Gα 15 protein. This enhanced response could not be attenuated in the presence of any of the tested α 2 AR antagonists (10 [*]μM), suggesting that inverse agonist activity did not occur at the mutant α 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR.</b> Ligands that so far have been identified as antagonists at the wt α 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> demonstrated either no intrinsic activity (MK 912, WB 4101, RS 15385, RX 811059 and RX 821002) or positive efficacy [Emax, % vs. 1 [*]μM UK 14304 : dexefaroxan (27 ± 7), idazoxan (34 ± 9), atipamezole (27 ± 4), BRL 44408 (59 ± 5) and SKF 86466 (54 ± 9) ] at the mutant α 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR,</b> but only {{in the presence of the}} mouse Gα 15 protein.

40|$|Purpose: A 3 {{adenosine}} receptor (<b>A</b> 3 <b>AR)</b> activation {{was shown}} to inhibit the growth of various tumor cells via the down-regulation of nuclear factor B and cyclin D 1. To additionally elucidate whether <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> is <b>a</b> specific target, a survey of its expression in tumor versus adjacent normal cells was conducted. Experimental Design: <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> mRNA expression in vari-ous tumor tissues was tested in paraffin-embedded slides using reverse transcription-PCR analysis. A comparison with <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> expression in the relevant adjacent normal tissue or regional lymph node metastasis was performed. In addi-tion, <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> protein expression was studied in fresh tumors and was correlated {{with that of the}} adjacent normal tissue. Results: Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of colon and breast carcinoma tissues showed higher <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> expres-sion in the tumor versus adjacent non-neoplastic tissue or normal tissue. Additional analysis revealed that the lymph node metastasis expressed even more <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> mRNA than the primary tumor tissue. Protein analysis of <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> expression in fresh tumors derived from colon (n 40) or breast (n 17) revealed that 61 % and 78 % had higher <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> expres-sion in the tumor versus normal adjacent tissue, respectively. The high <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> expression level in the tumor tissues was associated with elevated nuclear factor B and cyclin D 1 levels. High <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> mRNA expression was also demonstrated in other solid tumor types. Conclusions: Primary and metastatic tumor tissues highly express <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> indicating that high receptor expres-sion is a characteristic of solid tumors.
