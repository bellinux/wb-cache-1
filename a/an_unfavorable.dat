5|$|Rear Admiral John P. Whitney {{requested}} Shepard's {{services as}} an aide de camp, but Shepard wanted to fly. Therefore, at Shepard's request, Ramage spoke to the admiral on his behalf, and Shepard was instead sent back to Patuxent. He flight tested the McDonnell F3H Demon, Vought F-8 Crusader, Douglas F4D Skyray and Grumman F-11 Tiger. The Vought F7U Cutlass {{had a tendency to}} go into an inverted spin during a snap roll. This was not unusual; many aircraft did this, but normally if the pilot let go of the stick the aircraft would correct itself. When he attempted this in the F7U, Shepard found this was not the case. He was unable {{to break out of the}} spin and was forced to eject. In 1957, he was project test pilot on the Douglas F5D Skylancer. Shepard did not like the plane, and gave it <b>an</b> <b>unfavorable</b> report. The Navy cancelled orders for it, buying the F8U instead. He also filed <b>an</b> <b>unfavorable</b> report on the F11F after a harrowing incident in which the engine failed on him during a high-speed dive. Fortunately, he managed to restart the engine.|$|E

5|$|In December 1996, Patton {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to consider the}} issue of worker's compensation reform. Both Patton and the state's legislators believed that the generous benefits provided under Kentucky state law created <b>an</b> <b>unfavorable</b> business climate in the state. The reform measures adopted in the special session included a substantial reduction in benefits, including those to coal miners who developed black lung disease. Patton's support of this measure alienated labor leaders, especially in eastern Kentucky's coal mining communities – which had previously been among his strongest supporters. As the law began to take effect, Patton himself agreed that it had gone too far, and his Secretary of Labor worked with representatives from organized labor to draft changes in the law. Those changes were eventually made in the 2002 legislative session.|$|E
5|$|In {{pictures}} {{taken by the}} Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This motion is presumably an optical illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet, and not true superluminal motion. However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 could actually be a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from <b>an</b> <b>unfavorable</b> angle to appreciate the properties {{of that kind of}} galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Lili {{continued}} generally southward, {{reaching its}} peak intensity of 80mph (130km/h). Higher pressures developed to its northeast, {{resulting in the}} hurricane to accelerate to the southwest. On December 22, Lili finished executing its large cyclonic loop by passing over the same location it passed one week prior. The combination of its increased forward speed, as well as increased levels of vertical wind shear, created <b>an</b> <b>unfavorable</b> environment which caused steady weakening. On December 23, Lili weakened to a tropical storm while located 430miles (690km) northeast of Antigua.

5|$|On July10, PAGASA issued {{their final}} {{advisory}} on Tropical Depression Gorio {{as it moved}} out of their area of responsibility. Hampered by <b>an</b> <b>unfavorable</b> upper-level environment, the depression barely intensified into a tropical storm early on July11. Upon becoming a tropical storm, the JMA named the system Soudelor reporting peak winds of 65km/h, (40mph). Later that day the JTWC reported that Soudelor had weakened into a depression; however they re-upgraded it to a tropical storm as it moved closer to Hainan Province. Shortly before landfall in Leizhou Peninsula, China, the JTWC downgraded the storm to a tropical depression. After moving back over water in the Gulf of Tonkin, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the depression. The JMA, however, continued to monitor Soudelor until it made landfall near Fangchenggang, China several hours later.|$|E

Between 2004 and 2006, attempts were made to merge the republic with Krasnodar Krai, but the proposal met with strong resistance from the native Adyghe population and was eventually put to rest.

Instead, the inactivity {{was the result of}} the subtropical ridge being located further south than normal, which decreased the atmospheric instability across much of the basin.

5|$|Tropical Storm Claudette {{originated}} from a tropical wave that moved off {{the west coast}} of Africa on August7. On August11, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the wave when it was located roughly 600mi (965km) east of the Lesser Antilles. Disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity was associated with the westward moving wave; however, the NHC did not anticipate further development of the system. By the afternoon of August12, little convective activity remained with the wave. Strong upper-level wind shear created <b>an</b> <b>unfavorable</b> environment for the system to re-organize as it tracked through the eastern Caribbean Sea.|$|E

Failed railroad development further contributed to the demise of the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. Financial depression and David Crockett's failed attempt to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial prosperity in Randolph. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice, in September 1862 and again in 1865, discouraging many residents from re-building residences and businesses a second time.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Bud was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} and second named tropical cyclone of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. It formed as a tropical depression on July 10, {{to the south of}} the southern tip of Baja California. Shortly after, it became a tropical storm, and soon after the storm began to develop an eye. It began to intensify rapidly and was upgraded to a hurricane on July 11. Bud reached its peak intensity on July 13, becoming a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale at its peak. After reaching cooler waters and <b>an</b> <b>unfavorable</b> environment, the hurricane rapidly weakened and dropped to a tropical depression status on July 15. The system continued to lose its convection and eventually degenerated by the next day. As the storm remained away from land, no effects were reported as a tropical cyclone, though its remnant brought precipitation to Hawaii.|$|E
