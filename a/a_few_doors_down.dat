500|$|After Elizabeth Craigie's death, {{the entire}} {{property}} was leased by Joseph Emerson Worcester from her heirs; he in turn rented {{the eastern half}} of the house to Longfellow. In 1843, the house was purchased by Nathan Appleton, who gave the house to Longfellow as a gift when Longfellow married Nathan's daughter Frances. He paid $10,000 for the home. Frances wrote to her brother Thomas Gold Appleton on August 30, 1843: [...] "We have decided to let Father purchase this grand old mansion", especially after Longfellow's friend George Washington Greene reminded them [...] "how noble an inheritance this is — where Washington dwelt in every room". Longfellow was proud of the connection to Washington and in 1844 purchased a bust of the home's former occupant, a copy of the sculpture by Jean-Antoine Houdon. [...] Worcester and his wife became tenants under Longfellow in the western half of the house until their new home <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> <b>down</b> was completed that spring. Mrs. Longfellow wrote on May 5, 1844, [...] "Worcester family left us in complete possession , with rooms nicely cleaned, and uncarpeted stairs and entries".|$|E

6000|$|The Green Park end of Piccadilly was a changed, and in {{some respects}} a livelier {{thoroughfare}} to that which Yeovil remembered with affectionate regret. A great political club had migrated from its palatial home to a shrunken habitation in a less prosperous quarter; its place was filled by the flamboyant frontage of the Hotel Konstantinopel. Gorgeous Turkey carpets were spread over the wide entrance steps, and boys in Circassian and Anatolian costumes hung around the doors, or dashed forth in un-Oriental haste to carry such messages as the telephone was unable to transmit. Picturesque sellers of Turkish delight, attar-of-roses, and brass-work coffee services, squatted under the portico, on terms of obvious good understanding with the hotel management. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> further <b>down</b> <b>a</b> service club that had long been a Piccadilly landmark was a landmark still, {{as the home of}} the Army Aeronaut Club, and there was a constant coming and going of gay-hued uniforms, Saxon, Prussian, Bavarian, Hessian, and so forth, through its portals. The mastering of the air {{and the creation of a}} scientific aerial war fleet, second to none in the world, was an achievement of which the conquering race was pardonably proud, and for which it had good reason to be duly thankful. Over the gateways was blazoned the badge of the club, an elephant, whale, and eagle, typifying the three armed forces of the State, by land and sea and air; the eagle bore in its beak a scroll with the proud legend: [...] "The last am I, but not the least." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You understand," [...] Marlow {{interrupted}} the current of his narrative, [...] "that {{in order to}} be consecutive in my relation of this affair I am telling you at once the details which I heard from Mrs Fyne later in the day, as well as what little Fyne imparted to me with his usual solemnity during that morning call. As you may easily guess the Fynes, in their apartments, had read the news at the same time, and, as a matter of fact, in the same august and highly moral newspaper, as the governess in the luxurious mansion <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> <b>down</b> {{on the opposite side of}} the street. But they read them with different feelings. They were thunderstruck. Fyne had to explain the full purport of the intelligence to Mrs Fyne whose first cry was that of relief. Then that poor child would be safe from these designing, horrid people. Mrs Fyne did not know what it might mean to be suddenly reduced from riches to absolute penury. Fyne with his masculine imagination was less inclined to rejoice extravagantly at the girl's escape from the moral dangers which had been menacing her defenceless existence. It was a confoundedly big price to pay. What an unfortunate little thing she was! `We might be able to do something to comfort that poor child at any rate for the time she is here,' said Mrs Fyne. She felt under a sort of moral obligation not to be indifferent. But no comfort for anyone could be got by rushing out into the street at this early hour; and so, following the advice of Fyne not to act nastily, they both sat down at the window and stared feelingly at the great house, awful to their eyes in its stolid, prosperous, expensive respectability with ruin absolutely standing at the door." ...|$|E
