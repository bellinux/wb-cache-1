50|$|The {{amount of}} time {{required}} to complete the fuel polishing process depends on several factors. One {{of the most important}} is the specific fuel polishing machine used. Fuel cleaning machines can polish at rates from 8 litres per minute to upwards of 400 litres per minute, however the factors which govern the process are about more than just flow rate. In fact a high flow rate can be detrimental to the overall effect due to increased pressures in the filter stages and <b>adverse</b> disturbance <b>in</b> the <b>fuel</b> tank. Another factor can be the quality of the fuel. If the fuel is highly contaminated it will typically take longer to clean than a batch of cleaner fuel of the same volume. The third factor to take into account is the volume of fuel to be processed. It may seem obvious but the larger the volume of fuel that requires polishing, the longer it will take to complete the cleaning process.|$|R

By using experiment, research has been conducted in surfactant selection. The results of experiment show 4 surfactant, which is best used to the diesel engine is tween 80 and span 80. This experiment needs some water contents variation emulsifier with 10 %, 15 %, and 20 %. In this different variation of water is very influential on performance and NOx emissions.

40|$|Changes in fire {{activity}} {{over the}} last 8000 years are simulated with a global fire model driven by changes in climate and vegetation cover. The changes were separated into those caused through variations <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> availability, fuel moisture or wind speed which react differently to changes in climate. Disentangling these controlling factors helps to understand the overall climate control on fire activity over the Holocene. Globally the burned area is simulated to increase by 2. 5 % between 8000 and 200 cal yr BP with larger regional changes compensating on a global scale. Despite the absence of anthropogenic fire ignitions, the simulated trends in fire activity agree reasonably well with continental scale reconstructions from charcoal records, {{with the exception of}} Europe. For some regions the change in fire activity is predominantly controlled through changes <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> availability (Australia-Monsoon, American Tropics/Subtropics). For other regions changes <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture are more important for the overall trend in fire activity (North America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, Asia-Monsoon). In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, changes <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture alone lead to an increase in fire activity between 8000 and 200 cal yr BP, while changes <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> availability lead to a decrease. Overall, the fuel moisture control is dominating the simulated fire activity for Sub-Saharan Africa. The simulations clearly demonstrate that both changes <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> availability and changes <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture are important drivers for the fire activity over the Holocene. Fuel availability and fuel moisture do, however, have different climate controls. As such observed changes in fire activity can not be related to single climate parameters such as precipitation or temperature alone. Fire models, as applied in this study, in combination with observational records can help to understand the climate control on fire activity, which is essential to project future fire activity...|$|R
