25|$|Although men {{and women}} lie at equal frequencies, {{men are more likely}} to lie in order to please {{themselves}} while {{women are more likely to}} lie to please others. We are individuals living in a world of competition and strict social norms, where we are able to use lies and deception to enhance our chances of survival and reproduction. Stereotypically speaking, men like to exaggerate <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> expertise but shy away from topics that degrade them while women understate their sexual expertise to make themselves more respectable and loyal in the eyes of men and avoid being labelled as a ‘scarlet woman’.|$|E
25|$|Since the gay {{and lesbian}} {{veterans}} are not asked to disclose information <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation on medical forms, the healthcare providers are often unaware of this information when they consider medical treatment options. In response to these concerns, the Institute of Medicine suggested that patients disclose such information on medical records. The information will be confidential and only used to assess health. The VHA is striving to prevent this information from being shared with other organizations. Sharpe and Uchendu suggest the option of incorporating open-ended questions to encourage the veterans to supply additional written information.|$|E
25|$|According to {{results from}} the fifth wave of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, which interviewed over 14,000 people <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation, 94.2% of New Zealanders {{identify}} as heterosexual, 2.6% as gay or lesbian, 1.8% as bisexual, 0.6% as bicurious, 0.5% as pansexual, and 0.3% as asexual. No gender {{differences were found in}} the share of New Zealanders identifying as heterosexual (94.1% of men and 94.4% of women) or pansexual (0.5% of both men and women), but men were more likely to identify as gay (3.5%) than women (1.8%), and women were {{more likely than men to}} identify as bisexual (2.1% versus 1.5%), bicurious (0.7% v. 0.4%) and asexual (0.4% v. 0.1%). Women in all the non-heterosexual categories were significantly younger than women in the heterosexual category. Men in the gay, bisexual, and bicurious categories categories were also significantly younger than heterosexual men.|$|E

40|$|Coming out {{to their}} {{children}} is a dilemma that concerns many gay, bisexual, and lesbian parents with children from previous heterosexual relationships. How children found out about having a father who identified himself as gay, and <b>their</b> feelings <b>about</b> <b>their</b> father's <b>sexual</b> identity, were explored through qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with 36 sons and daughters (aged 19 to 36 years) whose gay fathers participated in the Gay & Bisexual Parenting Survey (Barrett and Tasker, 2001). Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis revealed that awareness of <b>their</b> father's <b>sexual</b> identity was often left unspoken for various reasons, and that acceptance came about through gradual understanding as well as direct discussion. Interview data indicated {{the complexity of the}} relationship between the young adult's personal acceptance of their father's gay identity and their consideration of social context when deciding how open to be to others <b>about</b> <b>their</b> father's <b>sexual</b> identity. This research has varied implications for therapeutic work with gay and bisexual fathers coming {{out to their}} children from previous heterosexual relationships...|$|R

25|$|Sherman and her coauthors {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} communications between the gay and lesbian veterans with their VHA providers and the experiences regarding their healthcare services. Most of them report dissatisfaction with their medical treatment. Many veterans state that they do not receive the necessary support from VHA medical providers. Moreover, they claim that their healthcare providers are not receptive to their medical needs, and they have never been asked <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation. Most of the veterans report that they do not feel at ease with their healthcare providers. The results of the study also show that some gay and lesbian veterans are disinclined to seek medical treatment from the VHA, {{and some of them are}} having trouble in finding equitable healthcare services. Based on the study, there are some inherent problems in the healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans.|$|E
25|$|Hensel {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a study with 387 female participants {{between the ages of}} 14 and 17 and found that as the girls got older (and learned more <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> self-concept), they experienced less anxiety, greater comfort with sexuality and experienced more instances of sexual activity. Additionally, across the four years (from 14-17), sexual self-esteem increased, and sexual anxiety lessened. The researchers stated that this may indicate that the more sexual experiences the adolescent girls have had, the more confidence they hold in their sexual behavior and sexuality. Additionally, it may mean that for girls who have not yet had intercourse, they become more confident and ready to participate in an encounter for the first time. Researchers state that these patterns indicate that adolescent sexual behavior is not at all sporadic and impulsive, rather that it is strongly affected by the adolescent girls’ sexual self-concept and changes and expands through time.|$|E
500|$|The {{newspaper}} {{has been}} accused from time-to-time of forcing public figures out of the closet. This policy of 'outing' individuals surfaced in 1996 during {{the debate over the}} Defense of Marriage Act, when the Blade and The Advocate were going to out Congressmen Jim Kolbe and Mark Foley. Neither publication did out either politician, and both publications later denied ever intending to out the Congressmen. In recent years, these accusations have resurfaced as Kevin Naff, current editor of the Blade, has accused the Washington Post of 'straight-washing' stories about LGBT individuals. Naff wrote that [...] "When someone is described as 'flamboyant,' 'eccentric' or 'a lifelong bachelor,' we know what’s being implied... Readers of the Washington Post had better hone their gaydar skills, because in story after story, the newsgathering behemoth either ignores questions of sexual orientation or employs endless winks and nods to convey what would be better spelled out." [...] When asked why identifying and outing of individuals by publications like the Blade, staff writer Greg Marzullo wrote [...] "Why do [...] insist on mentioning someone's sexual orientation at all? Because we're a queer paper." [...] As reported in the Washington Post, former editor Chris Crain summarized the Blades editorial reasoning for the 'outings' by stating that [...] "It is 2004, not 1954, and sexual orientation in and of itself is no longer a 'private fact' beyond the pale of inquiry." [...] The Blade, he wrote, [...] "would investigate and report about whether influential Hill aides are gay if facts <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation raise highly newsworthy questions of hypocrisy in the stands taken by anti-gay members of Congress for whom they work." [...] A former staff writer of the Washington Blade has noted objections to this perceived campaign to label individuals by their sexual orientations and has used a blog to register these objections.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{customary}} in {{the past}} for individuals - whether clergy or not - to remain secretive (in the closet) <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation and activity.

2500|$|There are {{no studies}} of {{adequate}} scientific rigor that conclude that sexual orientation change efforts work {{to change a}} person's sexual orientation.

The longstanding consensus of the behavioral and social sciences and the {{health and mental health}} professions is that homosexuality per se is a normal and positive variation of human sexual orientation, and therefore not a mental disorder.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to examine the utility of the theory of reasoned action (Fishbein and Azjen, 1975) in relation to people 2 ̆ 7 s propensity to engage in a range of different safe sex strategies, including engaging in an exclusive sexual relationship, avoiding casual sex, and asking <b>sexual</b> partners <b>about</b> <b>their</b> previous <b>sexual</b> and IV drug use history. It was proposed that the intention to engage in a particular safe sex practice would be influenced by the person 2 ̆ 7 s attitude towards engaging in the practice, as well as his or her perception {{of the extent to which}} others thought they should do so (subjective norm), while behavioural intentions were proposed to predict actual behaviour. The study was also designed to examine whether, after control of the effects of the components of the theory of reasoned action, the person 2 ̆ 7 s generalised control beliefs would explain any additional variance in either behavioural intentions or actual behaviour. One hundred and two sexually active heterosexual students participated in the study. At the first wave of data collection, subjects completed measures of intentions, attitudes, and norms appropriate to each of the different behaviours. Measures of actual behaviour were obtained at follow-tip (three months after first period of data collection). The results of the study indicated that attitudes and norms predicted intentions for avoiding casual sex and asking <b>sexual</b> partners <b>about</b> <b>their</b> previous <b>sexual</b> and IV drug use history, while intentions predicted actual behaviour for all three safe sex strategies. Although there were no significant main effects of control beliefs on intentions or behaviour, subjects with internal control beliefs were more likely than their counterparts with external control beliefs to behave in accordance with their intentions to engage in an exclusive sexual relationship and ask <b>sexual</b> partners <b>about</b> <b>their</b> previous <b>sexual</b> and IV drug use history. Additional analyses revealed that the levels and determinants of intentions and actual behaviour were, in general, similar for males and females...|$|R

2500|$|Congress {{rushed to}} enact the {{existing}} gay ban policy into federal law, outflanking Clinton's planned repeal effort. Clinton called for legislation to overturn the ban, but encountered intense opposition from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of Congress, and portions of the public. DADT emerged as a compromise policy. Congress included text in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (passed in 1993) requiring the military to abide by regulations essentially identical to the 1982 absolute ban policy. The Clinton Administration on December 21, 1993, issued Defense Directive 1304.26, which directed that military applicants {{were not to be}} asked <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation. This is the policy now known as [...] "Don't Ask, Don't Tell". The phrase was coined by Charles Moskos, a military sociologist.|$|E

The ADF also gives equal access to superannuation and death benefits for same-sex partnerships. Under the Human Rights Commission Act 1986, Discrimination or harassment {{on the grounds of}} sexual orientation, be it heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality, is prohibited.

When she stated that she was embarrassed about her past, but that she was telling the truth, Sheridan unflinching brandished her as a perjurer, plotter and gold-digger.
