25|$|Later in the Victorian period, the Regency {{seemed to}} retreat to an unthreateningly remote {{historical}} distance, and Kate Greenaway and the Artistic Dress movement selectively revived elements of early 19th century fashions. During the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, many genre paintings, sentimental valentines, etc. contained loose depictions of 1795–1820 styles (then considered to be quaint relics of <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> <b>era).</b> In the late 1960s / early 1970s, there was a limited fashion revival of the Empire silhouette.|$|E
25|$|Kothi Khas Bagh is {{a palace}} located at Rampur, about 30km east of Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh. It was the {{erstwhile}} {{residence of the}} Nawabs of Rampur. Set in a 300-acre compound, this huge 200-room European style palace is a unique blend of Islamic architecture and British architecture. It also features personal apartments and offices, music rooms and personal cinema hall of Nawabs. The huge halls, adorned with Burma teak and Belgium glass chandeliers, present a fine specimen of the architecture of <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> <b>era.</b> There is an Italian marble staircase towards the main bedrooms. The statue of Kalb Ali Khan, the second Nawab of Rampur, is an eye-catching one. Kothi Khas Bagh {{is now in a}} dilapidated state due to the age and neglect.|$|E

Ed Gonzales and Jeremiah Kipp, writing for Slant Magazine, said that the [...] "perilously low budget plays to Lost Skeletons advantage, and the scant 90-minute running time assures that it doesn’t wear out its welcome".|$|R

25|$|The {{process of}} Magyarization {{did not succeed}} in {{imposing}} the Hungarian language as the most used language in all territories in the Kingdom of Hungary. In fact the profoundly multinational character of historic Transylvania was reflected in the fact that during the fifty years of the dual monarchy, the spread of Hungarian as the second language remained limited. In 1880, 5.7% of the non-Hungarian population, or 109,190 people, claimed to have a knowledge of the Hungarian language; the proportion rose to 11% (183,508) in 1900, and to 15.2% (266,863) in 1910. These figures reveal the reality of <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> <b>era,</b> one in which millions of people could conduct their lives without speaking the state's official language. The policies of Magyarization aimed to have a Hungarian language surname as a requirement for access to basic government services such as local administration, education, and justice.|$|E
25|$|Following completion, {{the park}} quickly slipped into decline. One {{of the main}} reasons for this was the lack of {{interest}} from the Tammany Hall political machine, which was the largest political force in New York at the time. Around the turn of the 20th century, the park faced several new challenges. Cars were becoming commonplace, bringing with them their burden of pollution, and people's attitudes were beginning to change. No longer were parks to be used only for walks and picnics in an idyllic environment but also for sports and similar recreation. Following the dissolution of the Central Park Commission in 1870 and Andrew Green's departure from the project, and Vaux's death in 1895, the maintenance effort gradually declined. All of this changed in 1934, when Republican Fiorello La Guardia was elected mayor of New York City and unified the five park-related departments then in existence. Robert Moses was given the task of cleaning up the park. Moses, about {{to become one of the}} most powerful men in New York City, took over what was essentially a relic, a leftover from <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> <b>era.</b>|$|E
500|$|Other critics' enthusiasm was {{somewhat}} tempered. For instance, Stephen Holden of The New York Times lauded its visuals and its evocation of <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> <b>era</b> but felt that [...] "the monochromatic variations on sepia keep {{the actors and}} their adventures at a refined aesthetic distance ... At times the film is hard to see. And as the action accelerates, the wonder of its visual concept starts giving way to sci-fi clichés".|$|E

500|$|On 15 September 1935, {{one year}} after the death of Reich President Paul von Hindenburg and Hitler's {{elevation}} to the position of Führer, the dual flag arrangement was ended, with the exclusive use of the Nazi flag as the national flag of Germany. One reason may have been the [...] "Bremen incident" [...] of 26 July 1935, in which a group of demonstrators in New York City boarded the ocean liner SS Bremen, tore the Nazi Party flag from the jackstaff, and tossed it into the Hudson River. When the German ambassador protested, US officials responded that the German national flag had not been harmed, only a political party symbol. The new flag law was announced at the annual party rally in Nuremberg, where Hermann Göring claimed the old black-white-red flag, while honoured, was the symbol of <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> <b>era</b> and under threat of being used by [...] "reactionaries".|$|E
500|$|The {{photos on}} the album were taken by Michael Maggid, a friend of Morrison's then wife Janet Planet, {{in the town of}} Fairfax. The {{original}} LP was released in a gatefold sleeve. The cover photograph showed Planet, riding bareback on a horse, with Morrison walking alongside. The gatefold and back cover photographs showed Morrison perched upon the fence of the horse's paddock, with his wife standing to his right and a black-and-white kitten on the fence to his left. [...] This rural setting depicting <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> <b>era</b> was in vogue on album covers at the time as rock artists moved from cities to rural communities. [...] The Band, CSNY and Grateful Dead had similar themes on album covers in 1969 and 1970. [...] Morrison later complained of the cover, explaining that, [...] "The picture was taken at a stable and I didn't live there. We just went there and took the picture and split.

50|$|The {{railroad}} {{has four}} steam locomotives in regular service, {{as well as}} several diesel engines. Most of the railroad's engines are geared steam locomotives. These specialized types of steam engines—Shay locomotives, Heisler locomotives, Climax locomotives, and a Willamette locomotive were used in the early 20th century for logging. Compared to traditional side-rod steam locomotives, geared locomotives were better-suited for steep grades and hastily laid track. Thus, the MRSR seeks to preserve and operate historic geared locomotives and related logging technology in order to present visitors with a sense of <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> logging <b>era</b> critical {{to the development of the}} Pacific Northwest.|$|R

The {{magazine}} said that Underwurlde {{was the most}} simultaneously loved and hated game of its era—though Sabreman's invulnerability to direct damage was novel, the Your Sinclair also recalled the game's [...] "stratospheric level of frustration". Their readers, however, ranked the game {{near the bottom of}} their top 100 games for the platform. Underwurlde was later included in the 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation Rare Replay, wherein critics rated it among the worst of the 30 titles by Ultimate Play the Game and its successor, Rare. Kyle Hilliard (Game Informer) wrote that Ultimate's early games, such as Underwurlde, fared the worst in the package, though he was glad they were included. [...] "By today's standards," [...] began New Zealand newspaper The Nelson Mail, [...] "the likes of ...

500|$|The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) {{replied in}} the New Statesman that Goldacre was [...] "stuck in <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> <b>era</b> where {{pharmaceutical}} companies wine and dine doctors {{in exchange for}} signing on the dotted line". The ABPI issued a press release, writing that the pharmaceutical industry {{is responsible for the}} discovery of 90 percent of all medicines, and that it takes an average of 10–12 years and £1.1bn to introduce a medicine to the market, with just one in 5,000 new compounds receiving regulatory approval. This makes research and development an expensive and risky business. They wrote that the industry {{is one of the most}} heavily regulated in the world, and is committed to ensuring full transparency in the research and development of new medicines. They also maintained that the examples Goldacre offered were [...] "long documented and historical, and the companies concerned have long addressed these issues". Goldacre argues in the book that [...] "the most dangerous tactic of all is the industry's enduring claim that these problems are all in the past".|$|E

Jon Pareles for The New York Times simply highlighted {{a line from the}} song, [...] "I never play the victim". Neil McCormick for The Daily Telegraph thought that [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] {{was one of the few}} songs on the album to retain the [...] "vaguest leftover hints of her warm Caribbean vocal flavouring". Ann Powers for the Los Angeles Times was critical of Slash's inclusion on the song, and she described it as an [...] "afterthought". Powers wrote [...] "she can definitely get by without that ultimate rock phallic symbol", a reference to Slash. Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombell felt that [...] "Rockstar 101, alike [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "The Last Song", were [...] "instantly-dated missteps from <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> <b>era</b> when a Slash feature was cool". He further wrote that [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] and [...] "G4L" [...] were [...] "harder to justify considering their mindless boasts and torpid production". The song was met with a negative review from The Guardians Alex Petridis, who wrote [...] "At one extreme, the resemblance of 'Umbrella's chorus to that of a stadium rock ballad seems to have encouraged Rihanna to cut out the middle-man and just start making stadium rock: cue the awful widdly-woo guitars of 'Rockstar 101' and 'Fire Bomb.|$|E

A stunning first step from this San Diego band destined for greatness. Gigantic guitar hooks and earth-shattering drum work seem to burst through a cloud of smoke, all while the vocalist provides a hefty dose of eclectic melodies with lyrics that harkens back to <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> psychedelic <b>era.</b> With equal parts prog-rock and symphonic guitar ambience, [...] "American Art" [...] makes an undeniable statement." ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{evaluate}} Thornton’s early contributions to the great public debates of the mid-Victorian period. Specifically, it reveals his methods for resolving pressing public concerns of the day through the application of the postulates of classical economics. It also highlights the divergence of his conclusions from the orthodox formulations prescribed by some leading classical writers. The remainder of the article is organized as follows. The first section covers briefly Thornton’s views on the causes of and remedies for overpopulation and poverty in rural Britain. Sections 2 and 3 discuss his views, respectively, on the Old Poor Laws and the New Poor Laws. Section 4 reviews his recommendations on the reform of the industrial workplace and factory system. Section 5 covers his views on land tenure reform, with special reference to the so-called Irish land question. The next section presents a variety of responses by leading Victorian figures to Thornton’s early economic writings. It also highlights the pastoral verse he published in the 1850 s as a literary device intended to extol the virtues of <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> agrarian <b>era.</b> Some concluding remarks follow in section 7...|$|R

Grimonprez said: [...] "I saw what CNN did with war footage and then all these commercials spliced in between. I thought of the zapping as the ultimate form of poetry. It’s a visual poem." [...] The project continues as, according to Grimonprez, zapping became useless after 9/11 as all channels were beaming the very same images of the collapsing [...] "Towering Infernos", over and over again.
