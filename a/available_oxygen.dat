25|$|Seals, {{whales and}} {{porpoises}} have slower respiratory rates and larger tidal volume to {{total lung capacity}} ratio than land animals which gives them a large exchange of gas during each breath and compensates for low respiratory rate. This allows greater utilisation of <b>available</b> <b>oxygen</b> and reduce energy expenditure.|$|E
25|$|Researchers once {{attributed}} fatigue to a build-up of {{lactic acid}} in muscles. However, {{this is no}} longer believed. Rather, lactate may stop muscle fatigue by keeping muscles fully responding to nerve signals. The <b>available</b> <b>oxygen</b> and energy supply, and disturbances of muscle ion homeostasis are the main factor determining exercise performance, at least during brief very intense exercise.|$|E

The consequence of microorganisms decomposing acetone is the risk it has to cause oxygen depletion in bodies of water.

25|$|To create Breathing In/Breathing Out the two artists {{devised a}} piece in which they {{connected}} their mouths and took in each other's exhaled breaths until they had used {{up all of the}} <b>available</b> <b>oxygen.</b> Seventeen minutes after the beginning of the performance they both fell to the floor unconscious, their lungs having filled with carbon dioxide. This personal piece explored the idea of an individual's ability to absorb the life of another person, exchanging and destroying it.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of multicellularity was a pivotal {{point in the}} evolution of life on Earth. Shortly after multicellularity arose, there was an immense increase in the diversity of living organisms {{at the beginning of the}} Cambrian Era, called the Cambrian Explosion. Multicellularity is believed to have evolved multiple times on Earth because it was a beneficial life strategy for organisms. For multicellularity to occur, cells need to be capable of self-replication, cell-cell adhesion and cell-cell communication. There also must have been <b>available</b> <b>oxygen</b> and selective pressures in the environment.|$|E

25|$|Aerobic diving {{capacity}} {{is limited by}} <b>available</b> <b>oxygen</b> and {{the rate at which}} it is consumed. Diving mammals and birds have a considerably greater blood volume than terrestrial animals of similar size, and in addition have a far greater concentration of haemoglobin and myoglobin, and this haemoglobin and myoglobin is also capable of carrying a higher oxygen load. During diving, the haematocrit and haemoglobin are temporarily increased by reflex splenic contraction, which discharges a large additional amount of red blood cells. The brain tissue of diving mammals also contains higher levels of neuroglobin and cytoglobin than terrestrial animals.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike most shellfish, oysters {{can have}} a fairly long shelf life of up to four weeks. However, their taste becomes less {{pleasant}} as they age. Oysters should be refrigerated out of water, not frozen, and in 100% humidity. Oysters stored in water under refrigeration will open, consume <b>available</b> <b>oxygen,</b> and die.|$|E
2500|$|The diver {{intentionally}} hypoventilates, {{known as}} [...] "skip breathing". Skip breathing is a controversial technique to conserve breathing gas when using open-circuit scuba, {{which consists of}} briefly pausing or holding the breath between inhalation and exhalation (i.e., [...] "skipping" [...] a breath). This uses more of the <b>available</b> <b>oxygen</b> in the breathing gas, but increases the carbon dioxide level in the alveolar gas and slows its elimination from the circulation. [...] Skip breathing is particularly counterproductive with a rebreather, where the act of breathing pumps the gas around the [...] "loop" [...] to be scrubbed of carbon dioxide, as the exhaled gas is recycled and skip breathing does not reduce oxygen consumption.|$|E
