5|$|Depending {{on where}} it is used, the phrase has had {{different}} emphasis through the years. It was formally intended as <b>a</b> <b>prayer</b> <b>for</b> {{the soul of the}} condemned. However, in later times, particularly in the United States, it has only been said as a result of legal tradition where the religious meaning and origin is not founded on belief.|$|E
5|$|Bhopal: <b>A</b> <b>Prayer</b> <b>for</b> Rain is a 2014 {{historical}} drama film set {{amidst the}} Bhopal disaster {{that had occurred}} in India on 2–3 December 1984. It is directed by Ravi Kumar and features Martin Sheen, Mischa Barton, Kal Penn, Rajpal Yadav, Tannishtha Chatterjee, and Fagun Thakrar in important roles. Benjamin Wallfisch composed the film's music. Kumar got {{the idea of making}} a film based on the Bhopal disaster after he read a book based on it. Shot over a period of 18 months, it was originally slated for a late 2010 release. However, the lack of responses from distributors kept on delaying the release.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptians also {{interacted with}} deities through the {{donation}} of offerings, ranging from simple bits of jewelry to large and finely carved statues and stelae. Among their contributions were statues that sat in temple courts, serving as memorials to the donors after their deaths and receiving {{portions of the}} temple offerings to sustain the donors' spirits. Other statues served as gifts to the temple god, and inscribed stelae conveyed to the resident deity the donors' prayers and messages of thanks. Over the centuries, {{so many of these}} statues accumulated within a temple building that priests sometimes moved them out of the way by burying them in caches beneath the floor. Commoners offered simple wooden or clay models as votives. The form of these models may indicate the reason for their donation. Figurines of women are among the most common types of votive figures, and some are inscribed with <b>a</b> <b>prayer</b> <b>for</b> a woman to bear a child.|$|E
5|$|When Bishop Lyfing died in 1046, {{the king}} made Leofric Bishop of Cornwall {{as well as}} Bishop of Crediton. The two sees, or bishoprics, held by Lyfing became the see of Exeter in 1050 when Bishop Leofric moved his episcopal seat from Crediton to Exeter and {{combined}} it with Cornwall. The move of the see received the support of Pope Leo IX, and dates from 1051. Although Leofric had been a royal clerk before he became bishop, after his elevation he managed to avoid entanglement in the various disputes taking place between the king and Godwin, Earl of Wessex. Instead he spent his energies on the administration of his diocese, but remained on good terms with the king. Leofric's penitential, the Leofric Missal, still survives, and it includes <b>a</b> <b>prayer</b> <b>for</b> a childless king, which probably referred to King Edward.|$|E

5|$|The {{script was}} jointly written by Kumar and David Brooks Miller. In order {{to present the}} correct {{technical}} and medical facts in the film, Kumar analysed documents of the court proceedings, forensic evidences and interviewed several survivors of the tragedy and also the staff members of the Union Carbide plant. Bhopal Group for Information and Action and many activists fighting {{for the rights of}} the victim of the disaster wanted to stop the film's screening, called it an insult to the victims, blamed the filmmakers of distorting the facts related to the disaster, diverting attention from Dow Chemical Company which acquired Union Carbide in 2001 and for portraying Anderson as a person who wanted to help the people but was unable to do so. Sheen denied these allegations and said that he did not sympathise for Anderson. Kumar also denied these allegations and said that the organisations had seen an older script. He added that making the film was a life-changing experience for him. <b>A</b> <b>Prayer</b> <b>for</b> Rain was added to the film's title because had it rained on the night of 2—3 December 1984, fewer people would have died.|$|E
