5|$|A same-document {{reference}} is a URI reference to <b>a</b> <b>document</b> containing the URI reference itself. A URI {{reference is}} defined as a same-document reference if, when resolved to absolute form, it equates exactly to the base URI in effect for the reference. When encountering a same-document reference, document processing software, for example a web browser, to efficiently use its current representation of <b>a</b> <b>document</b> to satisfy the resolution of a reference to that document without fetching a new representation. URI equivalence {{is defined as}} when a URI reference, while not identical to the base URI, still represents the same resource.|$|E

The position of Official was held under the absentee Archdeacon of Lothian, Adam de Gullane, and afterwards, Archdeacon William Frere, and was probably held along with the post of vicar of Haddington; the latter he definitely held by 1295. Nicholas is found as Official in <b>a</b> <b>document</b> dating certainly between 1273 and 1285, <b>a</b> <b>document</b> which can probably be more precisely dated to between 1283 and 1285.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>{{document}}</b> that {{purports to}} be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, he or she is deemed to have known the contents of the document and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the contents {{and the nature of the}} contents of the document, and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay. Failure to do so without police authorization, or communicating the contents of such <b>a</b> <b>document</b> to others or publishing them is an offence.|$|E
