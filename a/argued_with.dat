5|$|Crush's {{rivalry with}} Vega ended {{when he joined}} the Nation in early 1997. Crush aided Faarooq in his feud with Ahmed Johnson. After his loss to Goldust at King of the Ring, Crush <b>argued</b> <b>with</b> Savio Vega, during Faarooq's WWF Championship title shot, which distracted Faarooq, causing him to lose the match. The {{following}} night on Raw is War, Crush and Vega, {{along with the rest of}} Nation were fired by Faarooq. As a result, Crush began feuding with Faarooq and formed his own biker faction called Disciples of Apocalypse, which was introduced on the June 23 episode of Raw is War.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{married his}} last wife, the wealthy widow Catherine Parr, in July 1543. A {{reformer}} at heart, she <b>argued</b> <b>with</b> Henry over religion. Ultimately, Henry remained committed to an idiosyncratic mixture of Catholicism and Protestantism; the reactionary mood which had gained ground following {{the fall of}} Cromwell had neither eliminated his Protestant streak nor been overcome by it. Parr helped reconcile Henry with his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth. In 1543, an Act of Parliament put {{them back in the}} line of succession after Edward. The same act allowed Henry to determine further succession to the throne in his will.|$|E
5|$|Llywelyn's power {{declined}} {{over the}} next two decades. In 1276 Henry's son, Edward I, invaded Wales following a dispute with the prince, breaking his power in South Wales, and in 1282 Edward's second campaign resulted in Llwelyn's death and the collapse of independent Welsh rule. Further defences were added to the walls until work stopped around 1290. Local disputes remained. De Clare <b>argued</b> <b>with</b> Humphrey de Bohun, the earl of Hereford, in 1290 and the following year the case was brought before the king, resulting in the temporary royal seizure of Caerphilly.|$|E

Her spending habits not only spelled conflict with the Grand Duke, but made her unpopular with the Florentines. This was compounded by her unseemly conduct, such as the two grooms who frequented her chamber at all hours.|$|E
5|$|Puccini saw Sardou's {{play when}} it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, {{obtained}} the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly <b>argued</b> <b>with</b> his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered {{at a time of}} unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public.|$|E
5|$|The Killigrews {{controlled}} the castle for several decades, with John Killigrew's son and grandson continuing in turn as the captain there until 1605.

The Admiralty eventually issued a compromise, proposing that the castles share the searching of the traffic.|$|E

5|$|The Red Hot Chili Peppers had {{released}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik in 1991. The {{album was}} an instant hit, selling over seven million copies in the United States, and turned the band into an international sensation. Guitarist John Frusciante was having difficulty coping with the band's newfound fame and started to dislike it. Frusciante often <b>argued</b> <b>with</b> his bandmates, and sabotaged performances. He began taking heroin and steadily increased his usage of the drug over time. Frusciante quit the band in 1992, during its Japanese leg of the tour. He returned {{to his home in}} California and became a recluse.|$|E
5|$|The rule of Michael the Brave, {{with its}} break with Ottoman rule, tense {{relations}} with other European powers and {{the leadership of the}} three states, was considered in later periods as the precursor of a modern Romania, a thesis which was <b>argued</b> <b>with</b> noted intensity by Nicolae Bălcescu. This theory became a point of reference for nationalists, as well as a catalyst for various Romanian forces to achieve a single Romanian state. To Romanian Romantic nationalists, he was regarded as one of Romania's greatest national heroes.|$|E

With age, however, George I <b>argued</b> <b>with</b> his sons and Olga lamented the quarrels that divided the family periodically. In private, Olga and George I conversed in German because it was the only language they both spoke at the time of their marriage. With their offspring, they spoke mainly English, although the children were required to speak Greek among themselves, and Prince Andrew refused to speak anything but Greek to his parents.|$|E

In the second half, despite playing with 10 men, Barton's teammates achieved an unlikely 4–3 victory. Barton left the City of Manchester Stadium in anger on 17 April, after not being named in the team to play Southampton. However, he featured regularly in the 2003–04 season, which he completed with 39 appearances and one goal. His displays impressed City's supporters, {{and at the end of}} the 2003–04 season he was awarded with the club's Young Player of the Year award.|$|E
5|$|Another shootout {{occurred}} between Henry Clark and Sykes Griffen on December 1, 1878, at Cassidy's Silver Reef Saloon. Although {{it is not}} known exactly what happened, it is believed that Griffen, a faro dealer at the saloon, and Clark, a regular patron, had previously argued over gambling matters. The shooting began when Griffen <b>argued</b> <b>with</b> Clark about a bet they had made. After arguing for several minutes, Griffen pulled a pistol on Clark and shot him. Several witnesses said that Clark pulled a pistol on Griffen and shot him, while other witnesses said that after Clark was shot, other patrons in the saloon, including Clark's father, beat and shot Griffen.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla's father, Septimius Severus, died on 4February 211 at Eboracum (now York) {{while on}} {{campaign}} in Caledonia, {{north of the}} Roman Britannia. Caracalla and his brother, Publius Septimius Antoninus Geta, jointly inherited the throne upon their father's death. Caracalla and Geta ended the campaign in Caledonia after concluding a peace with the Caledonians that returned the border of Roman Britain to the line demarcated by Hadrian's Wall. During the journey back to Rome with their father's ashes, Caracalla and his brother continuously <b>argued</b> <b>with</b> one another, making relations between them increasingly hostile. Caracalla and Geta considered dividing the empire in half along the Bosphorus to make their co-rule less hostile. Caracalla was to rule {{in the west and}} Geta was to rule in the east.
