5|$|Little {{is known}} of Jogaila's early life, and even his year of birth is uncertain. Previously historians <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in 1352, but some recent {{research}} suggests a later date—about 1362. He was a descendant of the Gediminid dynasty and was probably born in Vilnius. His parents were Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife, Uliana, daughter of Alexander I, Grand Prince of Tver.|$|E
5|$|Jackson, Moore and Smith did not {{recognize}} Simon Harwood, the officer who struck Tomlinson, {{and according to the}} newspaper <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> with the City of London police. This was four days before The Guardian published the video. The inspector passed this information at 4:15 pm on 3 April to Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, the Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death. Hall said he passed it to the City of London police before the first autopsy was conducted that day by Freddy Patel, which according to The Guardian began at 5 pm.|$|E
5|$|Maloney cast John Franklyn-Robbins as the Time Lord {{because he}} had worked with him before and {{intended}} his character to resemble Death in The Seventh Seal. Hilary Minster, who played a Thal soldier, had also played a Thal in Planet of the Daleks (1973). Minster had been considered {{for the role of}} Mogran. Peter Miles previously played Dr. Lawrence in Doctor Who and the Silurians (1970) and Professor Whitaker in Invasion of the Dinosaurs (1974). Stephen Yardley, who played the Muto Sevrin, later appeared in Vengeance on Varos (1985). During filming of Genesis, Yardley walked into the casting department on his lunch break in costume and asked for a job; because of his costume, they <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a tramp from the street. Dennis Chinnery, who played Gharman, had previously been seen in The Chase (1965) and would later appear in The Twin Dilemma (1984).|$|E
5000|$|Since Nixon is a Quaker, {{one could}} <b>assume</b> that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a pacifist; since <b>he</b> <b>is</b> Republican, however, one could also <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not a pacifist. The problem {{is how a}} formal logic of nonmonotonic {{reasoning}} should deal with such cases. Two approaches can be adopted: ...|$|R

5|$|In May 1965, a {{military}} tribunal under Kỳ sentenced both Thảo and Phát, {{who were still}} on the run, to death in absentia. As a result, Thảo {{had little choice but to}} move around indefinitely or attempt to seize power in order to save himself. He chose the latter. On May 20, a few officers and around 40 civilians, predominantly Catholic, were arrested on charges of attempting to assassinate Quát and kidnap Kỳ among others. Several of the arrested were known supporters of Thảo and believed to be abetting him in evading the authorities. In July 1965, he was reported dead in unclear circumstances after being hunted down; an official report claimed he died of injuries while on a helicopter taking him to Saigon, after being captured north of the city. It was generally <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> murdered or tortured to death on the orders of some junta members. Phát remained on the run for three years. During that time, Kỳ's power was eclipsed by Thiệu in a continuing power struggle, and the latter removed Kỳ supporters in the military from positions of high power. In June 1968, Phát came out of hiding and surrendered himself to the authorities. He was pardoned by {{a military}} court in August and released.|$|E
5|$|Their engagement, {{announced}} in May 1901, was unexpected {{by family and}} friends, as Peter had shown no prior interest in women, and members of society <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> homosexual. At the age of 19, on 9 August 1901, Olga married 33-year-old Peter. After the celebration the newlyweds left for the Oldenburg palace on the Field of Mars. Olga spent her wedding night alone in tears, while her husband left for a gambling club returning the next morning. Their marriage remained unconsummated, and Olga suspected that Peter was pushed into proposing by his ambitious mother. Biographer Patricia Phenix thought Olga may have accepted his proposal to gain independence from her own mother, the Dowager Empress, or avoid marriage into a foreign court. The couple initially lived with her in laws Alexander Petrovich and Eugénie Maximilianovna of Oldenburg. It was not an harmonious arrangement as Peter's parents, both well known for their philanthropic work, berated their only son for his laziness. Eugénie, {{a close friend of}} the Dowager Empress, showered her daughter-in-law with gifts including a ruby tiara that had been a present to Joséphine de Beauharnais from Napoleon, but Olga took a dislike towards her mother-in-law. A few weeks after the wedding, Olga and her husband traveled to Biarritz, France, from where they sailed to Sorrento, Italy, on a yacht loaned to them by King Edward VII of Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|There are {{no other}} known {{references}} to Goodwin but, given his age, it may be <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an active player from c.1701 until possibly c.1730 when {{he would have been}} 47. It would seem he played for Sunbury, which was a noted club in the 1720s and early 1730s, and perhaps for Middlesex as a county.|$|E
50|$|Generally speaking, {{he had a}} very {{domestic}} {{style in}} organizing his regiments. <b>He</b> tried not <b>be</b> involved in making political decisions. One can <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> fully content with his military career and responsibilities.|$|R

25|$|Members of the {{community}} council later recalled Anderson attending all their meetings during 2003, and <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> attending as their representative in the state legislature. They did not learn he was there as a consultant for VECO until 2004, when his state financial disclosure form was filed with the Alaska Public Offices Commission, as required by law.|$|E
25|$|The man {{was well}} dressed {{wearing a black}} leather jacket, blue {{trousers}} (size 50), blue socks, a black leather belt {{and a pair of}} black shoes (size 44). His clothes were from C, a popular fashion retail store in Europe with most of its stores in Germany and Austria. From the man's appearance it was <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a professional worker. He was a frequent smoker and several surveillance videos show him smoking outside often.|$|E
25|$|The {{book also}} {{presents}} evidence {{which suggests that}} Justice Minister Judith Collins leaked the name of public servant, Simon Pleasants, to Cameron Slater. Pleasants worked in the ministerial property department at Internal Affairs, and Collins <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> responsible for leaking details of Mr English's accommodation payments to Labour in 2009. Slater then published a series of blog attacks on Pleasants – who subsequently received a torrent of abuse including death threats. Pleasants denies ever leaking any information about English.|$|E

25|$|Reed and his {{men were}} {{determined}} to return with valuable information. Expecting that the rear of Princeton would be poorly guarded, they circled the town. They were about a half-mile southeast of Clarksville, almost in view of Princeton itself, when they spotted a British soldier walking between a barn and a house. Reed <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> looting, and sent two cavalrymen to take him prisoner. The Light Horsemen kept the barn between themselves and the house to approach closely without being noticed.|$|E
25|$|Despite this he was, surprisingly, {{called up}} for the first Test versus South Africa. Hondo <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to be a net bowler but he was bowling well in the nets and then the first choice, Brighton Watambwa, was injured and Hondo made his debut. He did not bowl well, in a poor team performance, and South Africa scored 600–3 declared, Hondo taking the wicket of Gary Kirsten for 212. Hondo acquitted himself well with the bat, playing {{supportive}} innings to Andy Flower's pair of centuries, but was dismissed in the second innings with Flower stranded on 199*.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} about 1787, {{the son of}} Colin Robertson of Perth, Scotland, a doctor who was {{required}} to leave Scotland, and of Grant Thompson, daughter of Bailie Adam Thompson. His family was of the Robertsons of Lude, his upbringing was Catholic, and it is <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in Perth, the birthplace London given in the Dictionary of National Biography being a later fabrication. Reacting against his background he went to Edinburgh and became involved with radicals there. By 1811 he had written for the Spy of James Hogg. He went to London in 1819, and did hack work for the publisher Thomas Boys.|$|E
5000|$|Eighteen years later, Henchard {{is now a}} {{successful}} grain merchant and Mayor of Casterbridge, known for his staunch sobriety.

25|$|At {{approximately}} 11:40 (09:40 UTC), Auvinen {{entered the}} school's ground-floor main hallway at Jokela High School, having missed his first lesson. He encountered {{a student in}} the corridor and killed him at 11:42, then moved to the lavatories. Soon after, other students found the victim's body, but <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> rendered unconscious from a bump to his head. Other students heard the sound of gunshots, but did not recognise them. At the lavatories, Auvinen fatally shot two more students, prompting the school nurse to call emergency services. After shooting and killing a student outside the lavatory, Auvinen ran after the nurse, caught up to her, and fatally shot her and another student at 11:46.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{controversial}} nature of the loss, Rahman's ranking did not suffer, but in November 1999, he was knocked out by Oleg Maskaev in the eighth round of a fight he looked to be winning. At one point during the match, Rahman was knocked through the ropes onto the floor, hitting {{his head on the}} floor. Rahman dropped out of The Ring top 10 {{as a result of the}} surprise loss. Rahman later said that he had seen Maskaev earlier in his career get knocked out in the first round by former champion Oliver McCall and he <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> brought in as an easy win. Because of this, he did not train as hard as he should have and was beaten.|$|E
25|$|By 1936 he {{was almost}} entirely {{painting}} on wood such a flat application of oil paint that even artists {{asked him if he}} painted in tempera. He had painted on canvas but with the painting of his plant subjects he felt closer to the earth if he worked on wood. One medium that he used and was very skilled was painting in oil on rice pith. This is very thin, like tissue paper although not paper at all but rather the pith of the rice plant cut under water by the Japanese. So deft was his use of oil on this transparent, lighter than air substance that there were often accusations that it surely could not be done with oil. The Japanese frequently used tempera on rice pith so everyone <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> using it as well.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Dougal has {{encountered}} the television crew, and because Ted has {{told them that}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the island's only priest, they <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> Father Ted.

25|$|Milan Drajicevic, {{the coach}} of the UBC Thunderbirds, {{happened}} to be at the practice when Cloutier was injured, and he suggested the Canucks use Levesque, UBC's second backup. Because of amateur call-up rules, the Canucks could not recruit the T-Birds' top two goaltenders, Kevin Swanson and Robert Filc. At the time Levesque was in one of the many UBC libraries studying for a geography exam he had the next morning. His friends and teammates scoured the campus, and when they found him, he <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the victim of a prank. He was not convinced otherwise until he {{received a phone call from}} Jon Wall, Manager of Scouting and Player Information for the Canucks. Once he realized the situation was real, he quickly received a one-time exemption from Canadian Interuniversity Sport rules to play in the NHL, and drove to General Motors Place to take a spot on the bench.|$|E
25|$|In late January 1942, the {{squadron}} became operational {{and joined the}} remnants of several others {{that had been in}} Malaya, operating out of RAF Seletar and RAF Kallang. During one of his first sorties, Gorton was involved in a brief dogfight over the South China Sea, after which he suffered engine failure and was forced to land on Bintan island, 40km (25mi) south east of Singapore. As he landed, one of the Hurricane's wheels hit an embankment and flipped over. Gorton was not properly strapped in and his face hit the gun sight and windscreen, mutilating his nose and breaking both cheekbones. He also suffered severe lacerations to both arms. He made {{his way out of the}} wreck and was rescued by members of the Royal Dutch East Indies Army, who provided some medical treatment. Gorton later claimed that his face was so badly cut and bruised, that a member of the RAF sent to collect him <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> near death, collected his personal effects and returned to Singapore without him. By chance, one week later, Sgt Matt O'Mara of No. 453 Squadron RAAF also crash landed on Bintan, and arranged for them to be collected.|$|E
25|$|Gort {{doubted that}} the French could prevail and on 23 May, Billotte, the only Allied {{commander}} in the north briefed on the Weygand plan, {{was killed in a}} road accident, leaving the 1st Army Group leaderless for three days. That day, the British decided to evacuate from the Channel ports. Only two local offensives, by the British and French in the north at Arras on 21 May and by the French from Cambrai in the south on 22 May, took place. Frankforce (Major-General Harold Franklyn) consisting of two divisions, had moved into the Arras area but Franklyn was not aware of a French push north toward Cambrai and the French were ignorant of a British attack towards Arras. Franklyn <b>assumed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to relieve the Allied garrison at Arras and to cut German communications in the vicinity and was reluctant to commit the 5th Infantry Division, 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, with the 3rd DLM from the French First Army providing flank protection, in a limited objective attack. Only two British infantry battalions and two battalions of the 1st Army Tank Brigade, with 58 Matilda I and 16 Matilda II tanks and an attached motorcycle battalion took part in the main attack.|$|E
