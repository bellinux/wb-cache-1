While McCartney later {{admitted}} that he found Indian music [...] "boring", Lennon was intrigued by the genre's mystical qualities, although he possessed a disdain for any formal method or training. Lennon was simply intrigued {{with the sound of}} the sitar and was open to the possibilities that the instrument had to offer. Harrison introduced drummer Ringo Starr to the tabla, an Indian hand drum. Starr was completely mystified and refused to learn how to play it; Harrison recalled it was [...] "so far out to him".|$|E
500|$|In Cowboys & Aliens, Director Jon Favreau sought [...] a {{plausible}} approach to how humans {{from the late}} 19th century could confront extraterrestrial beings armed with advanced weaponry. He said, [...] "It was very well laid out, well planned, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of discussions {{with a lot of}} actors who called me to task on things that seemed too convenient, so we made sure we earned each step." [...] The director also sought to maintain a Western tone as aliens appeared in the film, saying, [...] "It's very easy to just cut the string {{and then all of a}} sudden the action starts and you're in Independence Day." [...] Favreau cited the works of John Ford and Sergio Leone as sources of inspiration as well as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Favreau also wanted the science-fiction element to stand on its own, referencing Alien, Predator, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. He said of both genres, [...] "It's about finding the intersection of those two genres [...] [...] [...] If you do it right, it honors both, and it becomes interesting and clever and a reinvention of two things that people understand the conventions of, instead of just a retread or remake or sequel or reboot of a film you've seen before." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International, MacFarlane {{announced}} that the episode would become available on a special DVD release, with series producer Kara Vallow confirming the release would be available on September 28, 2010, along with Seth and Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show. A month after the announcement, Kevin Reilly, President of Fox Entertainment, stated that the final decision not to air the episode was largely due to concerns about finances and advertisers: [...] "Of all the issues, [...] {{is the one that}} seems to be the most of a hot button. Particularly at that moment in time, the economy was really struggling <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of very tough conversations going on with clients." [...] Reilly said that [...] "the advertisers know what they’re getting" [...] with Family Guy, and he thought that the episode handled the subject fine, but [...] "this one felt like it could cause trouble, and it was just not worth it." [...] Despite the concerns in the U.S. about the episode, it aired on June 20, 2010, on BBC Three in the UK, as a part of the season's regularly scheduled Sunday night run on the station. Although it was originally speculated that Adult Swim might air the episode, Fox stated that there were no plans to air it on their network. Several months before the episode debuted on television, the script was performed in a live table read at the Ricardo Montalbán Theatre in Hollywood, California on August 12, 2009. The special reading was attended by Academy of Television Arts and Sciences voters on the heels of the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. Family Guy was nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series, becoming the first animated program to be nominated in the category since The Flintstones in 1961. Commenting about the event, MacFarlane said, [...] "We did this to drum up Emmy votes, so we could lose by fewer votes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Three {{decades after}} her Grammy, Reddy {{discussed}} the song's iconic status: [...] "I think it came along {{at the right}} time.

[...] She confessed, [...] "At times, I have used made-up characters to keep the media at bay." [...] During an interview, she commented: [...] "I guess the girl that released Little Earthquakes was not a mother, {{and she was in}} her 20's, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things that she really did discover. She found her voice...and then nine records later, the woman who is putting out Abnormally Attracted to Sin knows what she did with her voice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mitchell and Webb {{were taught}} basic magical skills for the film, with them each {{receiving}} [...] "welcome pack of DVDs telling {{the history of}} magic". Andrew O'Connor {{was a member of}} The Magic Circle but was thrown out for revealing secrets, so he and Scott Penrose taught Mitchell and Webb magical skills. Webb spent two weeks [...] "trying to roll a coin across [...] fingers and [...] still couldn't do it", with Mitchell admitting that [...] "magic proved far more problematic than we anticipated". Webb stated that the worst part that he had to film [...] "was being buried up to the neck in sand. It's not the most comfortable place to be. I'd be buried for 30 minutes at a time, which doesn't sound that long, but {{it was the middle of}} summer <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of wasps around." [...] Mitchell had to kiss Jessica Hynes in the film, but admitted that he would have preferred to have kissed Robert Webb as he had done in Peep Show, which he claimed to have been easier, as for that scene he had to [...] "look absolutely rigid at the time". On the subject of the scene with Hynes, he stated that [...] "the scene went surprisingly well considering we had to do it in front of 700 extras, but if I'd had a single moment more to think about it I'd have been mortified with embarrassment." [...] Whilst filming in Nottingham, unit signs being used in the film were repeatedly being stolen by teenagers as they had the word [...] "magic" [...] on them. Multiple signs had to be ordered, at £3 each. The magic shield competition takes place in Jersey, but the filming for these was done in Skegness.|$|E

Then I reached our clearing just where the streams join in one; it had a fine autumn smell of burning, the smoke blew in the woods, and the boys were pretty merry and busy. Now I had a private design:--The Vaita'e I had explored pretty far up; not yet the other stream, the Vaituliga (g=nasal n, as ng in sing); and up that, with my wood knife, I set off alone. It is here quite dry; it went through endless woods; about as broad as a Devonshire lane, here and there crossed by fallen trees; huge trees overhead in the sun, dripping lianas and tufted with orchids, tree ferns, ferns depending with air roots from the steep banks, great arums--I had not skill enough to say if any of them were the edible kind, one of our staples here!--hundreds of bananas--another staple--and alas! I had skill enough to know all of these for the bad kind that bears no fruit. My Henry moralised over this the other day; how hard it was that the bad banana flourished wild, and the good must be weeded and tended; and I had not the heart to tell him how fortunate they were here, and how hungry were other lands by comparison. The ascent of this lovely lane of my dry stream filled me with delight. I could not but be reminded of old Mayne Reid, as I have been more than once since I came to the tropics; and I thought, if Reid had been still living, I would have written to tell him that, for me, it had come true; and I thought, forbye, that, if the great powers go on as they are going, and the Chief Justice delays, it would come truer still; and the war-conch will sound in the hills, and my home will be inclosed in camps, before the year is ended. And all at once--mark you, how Mayne Reid is on the spot--a strange thing happened. I saw a liana stretch across the bed of the brook about breast-high, swung up my knife to sever it, and--behold, it was a wire! On either hand it plunged into thick bush; to-morrow I shall see where it goes and get a guess perhaps of what it means. To-day I know no more than--there it is. A little higher the brook began to trickle, then to fill. At last, as I meant to do some work upon the homeward trail, it was time to turn. I did not return by the stream; knife in hand, as long as my endurance lasted, I was to cut a path in the congested bush.|$|E
