25|$|The 1958 Corvette {{received}} a body and interior freshening {{which included a}} longer front end with quad headlamps, bumper exiting exhaust tips, a new steering wheel, and <b>a</b> <b>dashboard</b> with all gauges mounted {{directly in front of}} the driver. Exclusive to the 1958 model were hood louvers and twin trunk spears. The 1959–60 model years had few changes except a decreased amount of body chrome and more powerful engine offerings.|$|E
25|$|ESC {{can work}} on any surface, from dry {{pavement}} to frozen lakes. It reacts to and corrects skidding much faster and more effectively than the typical human driver, often before the driver is even aware of any imminent loss of control. In fact, this led to some concern that ESC could allow drivers to become overconfident in their vehicle's handling and/or their own driving skills. For this reason, ESC systems typically inform the driver when they intervene, so that the driver knows that the vehicle's handling limits have been approached. Most activate <b>a</b> <b>dashboard</b> indicator light and/or alert tone; some intentionally allow the vehicle's corrected course to deviate very slightly from the driver-commanded direction, {{even if it is}} possible to more precisely match it.|$|E

25|$|The {{ability to}} sit upright was an {{important}} requirement for test animals in order that another common fatal injury among human victims, decapitation, could be studied. Additionally, {{it was important for}} researchers to be able to determine to what extent cabin design needed to be modified to ensure optimal survival circumstances. For instance, <b>a</b> <b>dashboard</b> with too little padding or padding which was too stiff or too soft would not significantly reduce head injury over a dash with no padding at all. While knobs, levers, and buttons are essential in the operation of a vehicle, which design modifications would best ensure that these elements did not tear or puncture victims in a crash. Rear-view mirror impact is a significant occurrence in a frontal collision; how should a mirror be built so that it is both rigid enough to perform its task and yet of low injury risk if struck.|$|E
25|$|Another {{departure}} from the Barris Batmobile was a single windshield and large, elevated bat-fins. Curiously, the car's underside was colored light blue, and it appeared to conceal the car's chassis except for a motorized panel, from which devices such as the Bat-winch would emerge. It is assumed Filmation's Batmobile used this light blue underside color to make the panel and devices easier to see. Additionally, the cockpit seating was a vibrant red, with <b>a</b> <b>dashboard</b> panel using bat accents around an inset monitor screen, among other details. Filmation's Batmobile used parachutes, inflatable pontoons and, in case of damaged tires, vertical and rear-mounted jets to lift and propel the car — which then essentially caused it {{to function as a}} high-powered hovercraft. The Filmation Batmobile from The Batman/Superman Hour {{was one of the few}} Batmobiles not to see adaptations to any DC Comics publications or have any commercially available replicas (toys, diecast cars, plastic model kits, etc.).|$|E

25|$|After both Friday {{practice}} sessions, the FIA {{tested for}} the first time a new system called the Virtual Safery Car, which is in response to minimising the risk of serious accidents and injuries, such as those suffered by Jules Bianchi at the Japanese Grand Prix. Its aim is to force drivers to reduce their speed by about 35% in an accident zone, with the aid of <b>a</b> <b>dashboard</b> display. Drivers have agreed it is a worthwhile system that, however, requires refinement for further testing at subsequent Grands Prix before introduction in 2015. Caterham and Marussia were each granted permission by the owner of Formula One's commercial rights Bernie Ecclestone to miss the Grand Prix after both teams were afflicted with long-term financial problems and placed into administration. This was the smallest field entered into a Formula One motor race since the 2005 Monaco Grand Prix. There were two driver changes for the first free practice session. European Formula Three Championship third-place finisher Max Verstappen replaced Jean-Éric Vergne for the second time this season, and Williams reserve driver Felipe Nasr drove Bottas's car.|$|E
25|$|Adam Branson : Adam is Tender's older twin brother. Because {{he was the}} firstborn, Adam got {{to stay in the}} Church {{community}} in Nebraska and marry, while Tender was among those sent to earn a living for the Church in the outside world. Adam is the person who leaked the community's illegal activities to the police ten years {{prior to the start of}} the novel, which was the event that instigated the community's mass suicide. Since then, Adam has been traveling the country, killing surviving members of the Church and masking the murders as suicides in order to motivate further suicides. His motivations are unclear. His goal seems to be to completely eradicate the Creedish beliefs and challenge the Church at its core. He also may see his actions as merciful to the victims of the cult brainwashing. In the course of the novel, he also kills the caseworker and the agent, making Tender the prime suspect in both murders. Adam and Fertility help Tender escape from the police as they come to arrest him, and as the brothers travel north in hiding, they return to the Creedish Church Compound, which is now the Sensitive Materials Sanitary Landfill. As they argue over their memories of the Creedish way of life, Tender crashes the car, which sends <b>a</b> <b>dashboard</b> figurine (of Tender) into Adam's eye. Adam forces Tender to beat him with a rock, thereby killing him.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the site}} BatmobileHistory.com, the Batmobile created for the 1968-1969 Filmation Associates TV series was not {{strongly}} based on its immediate predecessor (except for sharing dual rear cockpit canopies with the Barris/Futura Batmobile) or any version in DC Comics publications of the time. Furthermore, Filmation's Batmobile featured a long, black body with what {{is described as a}} [...] "Coke bottle" [...] profile, with a large, light blue bat emblem set across the hood, which, when <b>a</b> <b>dashboard</b> control was activated, the metal bat symbol folded its [...] "wings" [...] up at its center, forming a barricade/chain cutter.

Trains to Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands must accommodate other voltages, requiring tri-current and quadri-current TGVs. TGVs have two pairs of pantographs, two for AC use and two for DC. When passing between areas of different supply voltage, marker boards remind the driver to turn off power, lower the pantograph(s), adjust a switch to select the appropriate system, and raise the pantograph(s). Pantographs and pantograph height control are selected automatically based on the voltage system chosen by the driver.

On May 26, 2005, after months of inactivity and a deadlock on Sing the Body Electric's website, Scalamere proclaimed the breakup of the band on their message board in a profanity-plastered diatribe that implicated the unreachability of band members as a major factor.

[...] Eventually, Adam Lewis formed another band called Sub Rosa based in Los Angeles. Damon DeLaPaz has since formed alternative rock group Demasiado and punk/metal trio Laserwolf and Thunderbolt. He performed with Ape Machine, a rock band from Portland, Oregon, and recorded as a session drummer for various bands and musicians.|$|E
2500|$|The 1948 Citroen 2CV was {{launched}} in France with a manual headlamp leveling system, controlled by the driver with a knob through a mechanical rod linkage. This allowed the driver to adjust the vertical aim of the headlamps {{to compensate for the}} passenger and cargo load in the vehicle. In 1954, Cibié introduced an automatic headlamp leveling system linked to the vehicle's suspension system to keep the headlamps correctly aimed regardless of vehicle load, without driver intervention. The first vehicle to be so equipped was the Panhard Dyna Z. Beginning in the 1970s, Germany and some other European countries began requiring remote-control headlamp leveling systems that permit the driver to lower the lamps' aim by means of <b>a</b> <b>dashboard</b> control lever or knob if the rear of the vehicle is weighted down with passengers or cargo, which would tend to raise the lamps' aim angle and create glare. Such systems typically use stepper motors at the headlamp and a rotary switch on the dash marked [...] "0", [...] "1", [...] "2", [...] "3" [...] for different beam heights, [...] "0" [...] being the [...] "normal" [...] (and highest) position for when the car is lightly loaded.|$|E
