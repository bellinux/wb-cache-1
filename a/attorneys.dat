5|$|On March 9, 2006, a {{revision}} of the USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law. It amended the process for interim appointments of U.S. <b>Attorneys,</b> a clause Specter wrote during his chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The change allowed the Bush Administration to appoint interim U.S. <b>attorneys</b> without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. The Bush administration used the law to place at least eight interim <b>attorneys</b> into office in 2006. Specter claimed that the changes were added by staff member Brett Tolman.

5|$|During jury {{selection}} in the United States, <b>attorneys</b> have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option {{is a challenge}} for cause, in which <b>attorneys</b> must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude the juror. The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, <b>attorneys</b> have {{a limited number of}} peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E

5|$|The {{settlement}} of state inheritance taxes on two estates also plagued Black. In the first case, Governor Stanley {{had made a}} compromise {{settlement of}} back taxes with L. V.

In the second case, Stanley had appointed three special <b>attorneys</b> to collect inheritance taxes from the estate of Mrs. Robert Worth Bingham. Black wanted the <b>attorneys</b> to resign and save the state their large fees, but refused to remove them outright. This action was made more damning because one of the <b>attorneys</b> was a member of Black's campaign staff.|$|E
