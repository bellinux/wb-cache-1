5|$|Contrary to {{the view}} here popularized by Cassius Dio, however, Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor. Faced with a major crisis, he desperately needed the support of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> restore his damaged reputation. The only {{candidate}} with sufficient military experience, consular ancestry, and connections was Trajan. Likewise, Edward Gibbon's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors has found little support among modern historians.|$|E

These three men were joined in the room later by the mystery figure who was introduced as Vladislav, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> help Litvinenko win a lucrative contract with a Moscow-based private security firm.|$|E

25|$|Oesch got the {{opportunity}} to show his talents as front commander in March 1940. The Red Army had surprised the Finns by crossing the frozen Bay of Viipuri and gained a foothold on its western shore. Mannerheim had created the Coast Group to repel the enemy, but its first commander Major General Kurt Martti Wallenius was dismissed in disgrace after holding the command for only three days. The situation was extremely critical, and Oesch was appointed to deal with it. Finnish defenses consisted mainly of badly equipped coast defense battalions manned by older reservists and battalions hastily transferred from Lapland. Oesch was able to hold this motley and weary force together {{until the end of}} the war on 13 March 1940, causing heavy losses for the Red Army and significantly slowing its advance. Mannerheim began to regard Oesch as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> deal with difficult situations.|$|E
500|$|.....while Kilmer {{might be}} widely {{known for his}} affection for trees, his affection was {{certainly}} not sentimental—the most distinguished feature of Kilmer's property was a colossal woodpile outside his home. The house {{stood in the middle}} of a forest and what lawn it possessed was obtained only after Kilmer had spent months of weekend toil in chopping down trees, pulling up stumps, and splitting logs. Kilmer's neighbors had difficulty in believing that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> do that could also be a poet.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by R. W. Goodwin, an {{executive}} producer and director for the show. This marked the second instance where {{a member of the}} production crew wrote an episode, after the third season entry [...] "Wetwired", written by Mat Beck. The episode was influenced by An Anthropologist on Mars, a series of essays by Oliver Sacks, in particular The Landscape of Dreams featuring <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> recall every detail of his childhood. During the flashback sequences in the episode, various effects were created by manipulating the camera and its film.|$|E

[...] In 1224 she arranged the marriage of her daughter Berengaria to John of Brienne, a maneuver which brought Ferdinand III closer to the throne of León, since John was the candidate Alfonso IX had in mind to marry his eldest daughter Sancha.

500|$|In 1935, Somervell was {{appointed}} {{as head of}} the Works Project Administration in New York City. Over the next {{three and a half years}} he spent $10,000,000 a month on Great Depression relief works. He worked with the local politicians and labor leaders. He upheld the right of workers to form unions and improved relations with left-wing groups, once declaring that [...] "I wouldn't know a Red if I saw one, and wouldn't do anything about it if I did". The biggest project was the construction of LaGuardia Airport. Somervell established a reputation as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> handle projects involving hundreds of thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by R. W. Goodwin, an {{executive}} producer and director for the show. This was the second instance where {{a member of the}} production crew wrote an episode, the first being Mat Beck's [...] "Wetwired". [...] Goodwin was inspired to write the episode after reading An Anthropologist on Mars, a series of essays by Oliver Sacks, in particular The Landscape of Dreams featuring <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> recall every detail of his childhood. Goodwin {{came up with the idea}} of having Fox Mulder waking up in a strange place with no idea how he got there.

500|$|There {{is another}} {{instance}} where an historical source mentions <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> refer to either Ragnall or Rǫgnvaldr. The early thirteenth-century Bǫglunga sǫgur indicates {{at one point}} that men of two Norwegian factions decided to launch a raiding expedition into the Isles. One particular version of the sagas states that Rǫgnvaldr (styled [...] "King of Mann and the Isles") and Guðrøðr (styled [...] "King on Mann") had not paid their taxes due to the Norwegian kings. In consequence, the saga records that the Isles were ravaged until the two travelled to Norway and reconciled themselves with Ingi Bárðarson, King of Norway (died 1217), whereupon the two took their lands from Ingi as a lén or fief.|$|E
500|$|With {{his victory}} in the 1952 {{president}}ial race, Dwight Eisenhower became the first Republican president in 20 years. The Republican party also held {{a majority in the}} House of Representatives and the Senate. After being elected president, Eisenhower made it clear to those close to him that he did not approve of McCarthy and he worked actively to diminish his power and influence. Still, he never directly confronted McCarthy or criticized him by name in any speech, thus perhaps prolonging McCarthy's power by giving the impression that even the President was afraid to criticize him directly. Oshinsky disputes this, stating that [...] "Eisenhower was known as a harmonizer, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> get diverse factions to work toward a common goal.... Leadership, he explained, meant patience and conciliation, not 'hitting people over the head.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Although he {{remained}} on cordial terms with Senator Seward, Greeley never seriously considered supporting {{him in his}} bid for the Republican nomination for president. Instead, during {{the run-up to the}} 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago, he pressed the candidacy of former Missouri representative Edward Bates, an opponent of the spread of slavery who had freed his own slaves. In his newspaper, in speeches, and in conversation, Greeley pushed Bates as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> win the North and even make inroads in the South. [...] Nevertheless, when one of the dark horse candidates for the Republican nomination, Abraham Lincoln, came to New York to give an address at Cooper Union, Greeley urged his readers to go hear Lincoln, and was among those who accompanied him to the platform. [...] Greeley thought of Lincoln as a possible nominee for vice president.|$|E
500|$|Bacon's {{relationships}} {{prior to}} Dyer {{had all been}} with older men who were as tumultuous in temperament as the artist himself, but each had been the dominating presence. Peter Lacy, his first lover, would often tear up the young artist's paintings, beat him up in drunken rages, and leave {{him on the street}} half-conscious. Bacon was attracted to Dyer's vulnerability and trusting nature. Dyer was impressed by Bacon's self-confidence and his artistic success, and Bacon acted as a protector and father figure to the insecure younger man. Dyer was, like Bacon, a borderline alcoholic and similarly took obsessive care with his appearance. Pale-faced and a chain-smoker, Dyer typically confronted his daily hangovers by drinking again. His compact and athletic build belied a docile and inwardly tortured personality; the art critic Michael Peppiatt described him as having the air of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> [...] "land a decisive punch". Their behaviours eventually overwhelmed their affair, and by 1970, Bacon was merely providing Dyer with enough money to stay more or less permanently drunk.|$|E
500|$|Nate Patrin of Pitchfork Media {{cited the}} album as the 1960s' [...] "greatest studio-recorded soul LP", and further {{stated that it}} is [...] "a hell of a record, the {{crowning}} achievement of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> sound pained and celebratory and tender and gritty and proud all at once, with a voice that everyone from John Fogerty to Swamp Dogg to Cee-lo owes a debt to". Claudrena N. Harold of PopMatters also praised the diverse sound, which, according to her, {{is a mixture of}} [...] "Motown pop, the blues, British rock, and Southern Soul", although she cited [...] as Redding's best album. Rolling Stone described the album as [...] "Redding's true dictionary of soul, a stunning journey through the past and future vocabulary of R... documenting a masterful artist rising to... the immense challenge of his times." [...] In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Rolling Stone journalist Paul Evans gave Otis Blue five out of five stars and cited the album as Redding's [...] "first masterwork".|$|E

500|$|A vetrenjak {{from the}} village of Trlić had {{reportedly}} claimed that he clashed with oxen and rams led by devils whose aim was to discharge hail over his village. Seeing hail clouds, people in Tamnava would shout, [...] "Keep your cattle out of our crops!" [...] Thus they addressed hanged and drowned persons who were imagined to fly before the clouds and lead them. Farmers avoided leaving a harrow on the field, as they thought that the hail-bringing devils could slam it on the head of the vetrenjak who defended the village. People behaved amicably toward vetrenjaks, but they warned their children to keep off from them, as these men had [...] "business with devils". In 2004, ethnographers interviewed elderly people in a group of hamlets south-west of the town of Valjevo, who defined the vetrenjak as a man able to direct the movement of clouds. When such a man died, the wind would suddenly start to blow and clouds would loom. The term vetrenjak also designated <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> fly invisible, which he usually did by night. He was born with a caul which was thrown away and eaten by birds.|$|E
500|$|On July 16, 1999, tragedy {{struck the}} Kennedy family again when [...] John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s [...] Piper Saratoga light {{aircraft}} {{crashed into the}} Atlantic Ocean {{off the coast of}} Martha's Vineyard. The accident killed Kennedy, his wife, and sister-in-law. As patriarch, Ted consoled his extended family along with President Clinton at the public memorial service. He paraphrased William Butler Yeats by saying of his nephew: [...] "We dared to think, in that other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But like his father, he had every gift but length of years." [...] Ted now served as a role model for Maria Shriver, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Joseph Patrick Kennedy II, and other family members. The Boston Globe wrote of the changed role: [...] "It underscored the evolution that surprised so many people who knew the Kennedys: Teddy, the baby of the family, who had grown into <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> sometimes be dissolute and reckless, had become the steady, indispensable patriarch, the one the family turned to in good times and bad." ...|$|E
500|$|Hardy said: [...] "He {{combined}} a {{power of}} generalization, a feeling for form, and a capacity for rapid modification of his hypotheses, that were often really startling, and made him, in his own peculiar field, without a rival in his day. The limitations of his knowledge were as startling as its profundity. Here was <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> work out modular equations and theorems... to orders unheard of, whose mastery of continued fractions was... beyond that of any mathematician in the world, who had found for himself the functional equation of the zeta function and the dominant terms {{of many of the}} most famous problems in the analytic theory of numbers; and yet he had never heard of a doubly periodic function or of Cauchy's theorem, and had indeed but the vaguest idea of what a function of a complex variable was...". When asked about the methods Ramanujan employed to arrive at his solutions, Hardy said that they were [...] "arrived at by a process of mingled argument, intuition, and induction, of which he was entirely unable to give any coherent account." [...] He also stated that he had [...] "never met his equal, and can compare him only with Euler or Jacobi." ...|$|E
