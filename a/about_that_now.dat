For this reason, since they were very hard to fight with, the Callaicans themselves have not only furnished the surname {{for the man who}} defeated the Lusitanians [...] but they have also brought it <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> already, the most of the Lusitanians are called Callaicans.|$|E
60|$|ASHER (hesitating, {{speaking}} with difficulty). Don't worry <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> George.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{need not}} talk <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> Bertie. You are {{certainly}} an unlucky beggar; {{this is the}} second time you have been wrecked." ...|$|E
6000|$|Leo soothingly {{laid her}} hand on her arm. [...] "Let us not think <b>about</b> <b>that</b> just <b>now.</b> Let us wait until we are safely out of this dreadful place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Collie, I'm honest <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> And <b>now</b> you {{be just as}} honest. Do {{you think}} Jack will stand to his colors? Never drink--never gamble--never fly off the handle again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Roberts: [...] "That's true, {{and thank}} you, Amy. I forgot all <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> But <b>now,</b> Edward, dear, you will remember, won't you? If I could only stay with you----" ...|$|R
6000|$|Helen {{pressed his}} arm. [...] "We have both made mistakes; but we won't talk <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> Do {{you really feel}} you're getting better?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} need trouble <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>now,</b> Miss Northwick," [...] said Matt. [...] "Nothing need {{be done about the}} {{property}} at present." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{one right}} back of you. But don't bother <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> Just {{take it easy}} and rest yourself," [...] went on Dick, soothingly.|$|E
6000|$|... "As you please, brother. We {{are only}} too {{glad to have}} you home again, to care much <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> But, <b>now,</b> I have {{something}} of importance to tell you about myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|BROADBENT [rising also, {{not a bit}} snubbed]. Ha! ha! you may laugh; but {{we shall}} see. However, don't let us argue <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Come <b>now!</b> you ask my advice about Miss Reilly? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{a curious}} way," [...] Babbie answered, shortly, [...] "but I can't tell you <b>about</b> <b>that</b> just <b>now.</b> Would {{you like to}} hear all about me?" [...] Suddenly {{she seemed to have}} become confidential.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't quite enough, Alice," [...] he said, [...] "although it is a {{very great}} deal; but we need not talk <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> Oh, here is uncle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've wished {{a hundred}} times they hadn't asked us; but it's too late to think <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> The {{question}} is, {{what are we going}} to do about Penelope?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>Now</b> {{come and}} have a turn. I am bound not {{to give you a}} ring; but you are bound to accept {{anything}} else I may offer." ...|$|E
50|$|From the Middle Ages {{come the}} first written {{documents}} <b>about</b> the villages <b>that</b> <b>now</b> compose the town.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right, ain't it?" [...] ses the barmaid, as {{he stood}} staring very 'ard at the change. [...] "I ain't sure <b>about</b> <b>that</b> 'arf-crown, <b>now</b> I come to look at it; but it's the one you gave me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hum! We {{will talk}} <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> And <b>now</b> let us hear a true {{account of the}} next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Think about it! What do {{you mean}} by {{thinking}} about it? But I can't talk <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> I'm very busy, and shall be here till past seven. I suppose you can stay?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We won't argue <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> Edgar. At {{any rate}} I shall {{be glad to}} see to the sale of these Eastern goods, though, of course, it will be but a small thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, let's {{not talk}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> Ma!" [...] cried the young captain. [...] "I {{want to hear}} all about what dad and Uncle Tom and Uncle Sam have been doing in France." ...|$|E
6000|$|Slocum smiled drily. [...] "If you hadn't wanted {{quite so}} many dry goods, I'm {{not sure it}} would have come to this, but we needn't worry <b>about</b> <b>that</b> just <b>now.</b> Tom will have the horses round in 'bout five minutes. You don't figure on taking all that truck along with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, yes, the dragon,' said Earl Dorm, 'I was {{forgetting the}} dragon. I {{want to have}} a long talk with you <b>about</b> <b>that</b> dragon. Not <b>now.</b> Later on.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, Ned," [...] {{interrupted}} the old gentleman, with a benign smile, [...] "we'll not dispute <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Let us <b>now</b> go {{and take a}} run round the grounds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What madness not to {{have had}} one of those before {{tackling}} Aunt Dahlia! However, too late to worry <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> Tell me of Gussie. How did he make out at the fancy-dress ball?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "they are. But I {{will show}} you how they manage that by and by. There is {{something}} very curious <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>Now</b> let us look down the river again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is where}} the old pirate who made the map lives," [...] he whispered, {{as he reached the}} door. [...] "If he’s got {{anything}} to say I’ll tackle him <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>Now,</b> pull yourself together!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rubbish!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "If {{you begin}} {{calling me a}} stranger--but there, never mind! We'll see <b>about</b> <b>that</b> after dinner. <b>Now</b> what is the other cause for depression?" ...|$|R
60|$|Tootles' {{face was}} very white, {{but there was}} a dignity <b>about</b> him <b>now</b> <b>that</b> had never been there before.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll talk <b>about</b> <b>that</b> later. Jest <b>now</b> there's {{a chance}} others {{will find out}} where you are, for Joe and Bill have gone after men to help search for Billings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all!" [...] was the low reply. [...] "But we won't speak <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> Brice," [...] added Colonel Colby significantly; and thereupon {{the young}} teacher {{understood}} {{and said no}} more about the matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not asking}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> We hope {{there will be}} years and years to come, in which you may change them, and shape them as you will. What shall I tell him now from you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe them}} to be good, praiseworthy, godly women. But it is useless to talk <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> Good-night, Rachel," [...] and she gave her hand coldly to her sister. [...] "Good-night, mother; I wish I could see you alone to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He can't do {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> claim <b>now.</b> Our claim is established by law, {{and he is}} nothing but an escaped jailbird. But I agree he may give us lots of trouble in other directions. I presume {{he would like to}} see us all hung for the way we got ahead of him and his tools." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “The {{schooner}} has enticed us in here,” Will said, “there is {{no doubt}} <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> and <b>now</b> {{there is nothing to}} do but to fight it out. Take her head round,” he said, “we will settle it with the cutter first. The schooner cannot come to her assistance for some minutes as she has all her sails furled.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That'll be <b>about</b> {{enough of}} <b>that,</b> <b>now.</b> Ain't you the kidder!" [...] She {{modified}} her chiding words by a deep, long, beaming, smile-embellished {{look at her}} cavalier. [...] "We'll drink our beer before we go, ha?" ...|$|R
