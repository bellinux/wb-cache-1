Two independent targets within the endogenous maize acetohydroxyacid synthase gene sequence were modified in a site-specific fashion, thereby conferring resistance to either imidazolinone or sulfonylurea herbicides. Similarly, an engineered green fluorescence protein transgene was site-specifically modified in vivo. Expression of the introduced inactive green fluorescence protein was restored, and plants containing the modified transgene were regenerated. Progeny analysis indicated Mendelian {{transmission of the}} converted transgene. The efficiency of gene conversion mediated by chimeric oligonucleotides in maize was estimated as 10 − 4, which is 1 – 3 orders of magnitude higher than frequencies reported for gene targeting by homologous recombination in plants.

40|$|International audienceThe {{adaptation}} of root architecture to environmental constraints {{is a major}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>trait,</b> notably in legumes, the third main crop worldwide. This root developmental plasticity depends on the formation of lateral roots (LRs) emerging from primary roots. In the model legume Medicago truncatula, the HD-Zip I transcription factor HB 1 is expressed in primary and lateral root meristems and induced by salt stress. Constitutive expression of HB 1 in M. truncatula roots alters their architecture, whereas hb 1 TILLING mutants showed increased lateral root emergence. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay, promoter mutagenesis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR assays revealed that HB 1 directly recognizes a CAATAATTG cis-element present in the promoter of a LOB-like (for Lateral Organ Boundaries) gene, LBD 1, transcriptionally regulated by auxin. Expression of these genes in response to abscisic acid and auxin and their behavior in hb 1 mutants revealed an HB 1 -mediated repression of LBD 1 acting during LR emergence.

Final yield is a significant <b>agricultural</b> <b>trait</b> in rice breeding. In the screening and evaluation of the rice varieties, measuring and evaluating rice yield is essential. Conventional means of measuring rice yield mainly depend on manual determination, which is tedious, labor-intensive, subjective and error-prone, especially when large-scale plants were to be investigated. This paper presented an in vivo, automatic and high-throughput method to estimate the yield of individual pot-grown rice plant using multi-angle RGB imaging and image analysis. In this work, we demonstrated a new idea of estimating rice yield from projected panicle area, projected area of leaf and stem and fractal dimension. 5 -fold cross validation showed that the predictive error was 7. 45 %.

In addition, natural variation in circadian rhythms is important for local adaptation 2, 3, 4. However, quantitative modulation of circadian rhythms due to artificial selection {{has not yet been}} reported. Here we show that the circadian clock of cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) has slowed during domestication. Allelic variation of the tomato homolog of the Arabidopsis gene EID 1 is responsible for a phase delay. Notably, the genomic region harboring EID 1 shows signatures of a selective sweep. We find that the EID 1 allele in cultivated tomatoes enhances plant performance specifically under long day photoperiods, suggesting that humans selected slower circadian rhythms to adapt the cultivated species to the long summer days it encountered as it was moved away from the equator...|$|R

An elaborate combination of previously adopted or new strategies {{will be needed to}} produce rice lines with even more tolerance to low Fe availability in problematic soils without loss of favorable <b>agricultural</b> <b>traits.</b> Manipulation of DMAS genes, which were recently cloned and thus have not been genetically modified, in the steps of MAs biosynthesis [2] would be of special interest. In addition, further clarification of the underlying mechanisms involved in Fe homeostasis is extremely important, including expressional regulation, secretion of MAs, and metal translocation inside the plants.|$|R
40|$|Summary Major {{advances}} in crop yields {{are needed in}} the coming decades. However, plant breeding is currently limited by incremental improvements in quantitative traits that often rely on laborious selection of rare naturally occurring mutations in gene-regulatory regions. Here, we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas 9 genome editing of promoters generates diverse cis-regulatory alleles that provide beneficial quantitative variation for breeding. We devised a simple genetic scheme, which exploits trans-generational heritability of Cas 9 activity in heterozygous loss-of-function mutant backgrounds, to rapidly evaluate the phenotypic impact of numerous promoter variants for genes regulating three major productivity traits in tomato: fruit size, inflorescence branching, and plant architecture. Our approach allows immediate selection and fixation of novel alleles in transgene-free plants and fine manipulation of yield components. Beyond a platform to enhance variation for diverse <b>agricultural</b> <b>traits,</b> our findings provide a foundation for dissecting complex relationships between gene-regulatory changes and control of quantitative traits...|$|R

However, its biosynthesis pathway is still not completely clear.

Samples at 7 time points of three growth stages were studied. The data of profiles were subjected to multivariate analysis with partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The results indicated that there were clear differences in terpenoids and artemisinin metabolism between different growth stages and genotypes. Twenty-one compounds, including artemisinin and its related precursors, were selected as the market compounds of the PLS-DA between the two genotypes. Among them, artemisinic acid, arteannuin 13, borneol, beta-farnesene and an unidentified sesquiterpenoid (peak 48) were abundant in 001, while camphor, methyl artemisinic acid and lanceol accumulated mainly in SP 18.

40|$|Grain {{quality is}} an {{important}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>trait</b> that is mainly determined by grain size and composition. Here, we characterize {{the role of the}} rice transcription factor (TF) SALT-RESPONSIVE ERF 1 (SERF 1) during grain development. Through genome-wide expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that SERF 1 directly regulates RICE PROLAMIN-BOX BINDING FACTOR (RPBF), a TF that functions as a positive regulator of grain filling. Loss of SERF 1 enhances RPBF expression resulting in larger grains with increased starch content, while SERF 1 overexpression represses RPBF resulting in smaller grains. Consistently, during grain filling, starch biosynthesis genes such as GRANULE-BOUND STARCH SYNTHASEI (GBSSI), STARCH SYNTHASEI (SSI), SSIIIa, and ADP-GLUCOSE PYROPHOSPHORYLASE LARGE SUBUNIT 2 (AGPL 2) are up-regulated in SERF 1 knockout grains. Moreover, SERF 1 is a direct upstream regulator of GBSSI. In addition, SERF 1 negatively regulates germination by controlling RPBF expression, which mediates the gibberellic acid (GA) -induced expression of RICE AMYLASE 1 A (RAmy 1 A). Loss of SERF 1 results in more rapid seedling establishment, while SERF 1 overexpression has the opposite effect. Our study reveals that SERF 1 represents a negative regulator of grain filling and seedling establishment by timing the expression of RPBF. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Myostatin (MSTN) is a {{well-known}} negative regulator of muscle growth. Animals that possess mutations within this gene display an enhanced muscling phenotype, a desirable <b>agricultural</b> <b>trait.</b> Increased neonatal morbidity is common, however, resulting from complications arising from the birth of offspring with increased fetal muscle mass. The objective of the current research was to generate an attenuated MSTN-null phenotype in a large-animal model using RNA interference to enhance muscle development without the detrimental consequences of an inactivating mutation. To this end, we identified a series of short interfering RNAs that demonstrated effective suppression of MSTN mRNA and protein levels. To produce transgenic offspring capable of stable MSTN suppression in vivo, a recombinant lentiviral vector expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting MSTN for silencing was introduced into bovine fetal fibroblasts. These cells were used as nucleus donors for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Twenty blastocysts were transferred into seven recipient cows resulting in five pregnancies. One transgenic calf developed to term, but died following delivery by Caesarean-section. As an alternative strategy, microinjection of recombinant lentiviral particles into the perivitelline space of in vitro-produced bovine zygotes was utilized to produce 40 transgenic blastocysts that were transferred into 14 recipient cows, resulting in 7 pregnancies. Five transgenic calves were produced, of which three expressed the transgene.

30|$|An {{effective}} application of MAS in breeding {{is in the}} elimination of linkage drag, the co-introduction of beneficial and undesirable <b>agricultural</b> <b>traits</b> from exotic genetic resources. The durable blast resistance gene pi 21 {{was found to be}} linked with gene(s) associated with inferior eating quality within a 40 -kb distance (Fukuoka et al. 2009). In that study, desirable recombinants between pi 21 and the genes conferring inferior eating quality were successfully selected from a large breeding population by using DNA markers for the region around pi 21. The availability of DNA markers closely linked to the genes of interest enabled a breakthrough in the development of durably resistant cultivars that had not been achieved during 80  years of conventional breeding in Japan. This is a clear example of selection in breeding that could not have been achieved without the use of DNA markers tightly linked to the genes and DNA regions of interest.|$|R
40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{is a key}} small {{molecule}} that orchestrates plant growth, {{development and}} immune function. The chief mechanism for the transfer of NO bioactivity {{is thought to be}} S-nitrosylation, the addition of an NO moiety to a protein cysteine thiol to form an S-nitrosothiol (SNO). The enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) indirectly controls the total levels of cellular S-nitrosylation, by turning over S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), the major cellular NO donor. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum. L) a decrease in GSNOR expression, which is expected to increase the extent of cellular SNO formation, resulted in morphological phenotypes and disabled disease resistance. In contrast, increased GSNOR activity enhanced protection against an ordinarily virulent bacterial pathogen. Collectively, these results are similar to previous findings using the reference plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Thus, the role of GSNOR may be highly conserved across the plant kingdom and manipulating the function of this protein may control important <b>agricultural</b> <b>traits</b> in crop plants...|$|R

Vermicompost enhances soil biodiversity by promoting the beneficial microbes which inturn enhances plant growth directly by production of plant growth-regulating hormones and enzymes and indirectly by controlling plant pathogens, nematodes and other pests, thereby enhancing plant health and minimizing the yield loss.

Using a natural microspore-derived doubled haploid plant, we generated self-crossed progeny with overlapping or outward curling head morphotypes. Sequencing-based bulked segregant analysis (Seq-BSA) revealed a candidate region of 0. 52 Mb (A 06 : 1, 824, 886 ~ 2, 347, 097 bp) containing genes enriched for plant hormone signal transduction. RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis supported the hormone pathway enrichment leading to the identification of two key candidate genes, BrGH 3. 12 and BrABF 1. The regulated homologous genes {{and the relationship between}} genes in this pathway were also revealed. Expression of BrGH 3. 12 varied significantly in the apical portion of the leaf, consistent with the morphological differences between overlapping and outward curling leaves. Transcript levels of BrABF 1 in the top, middle and basal segments of the leaf were significantly different between the two types. The two morphotypes contained different concentrations of IAA in the apical portion of their leaves while levels of ABA differed significantly between plant types in the top, middle, and basal leaf segments. Results from Seq-BSA, RNA-Seq and metabolite analyses all support a role for IAA and ABA in heading type formation.

FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) -like gene function is crucial for the initiation of flowering in various plant species and also in asexual reproduction in tuber plants. By employing various computational analysis using RNA-Seq data, we identified eight FT-like genes (AcFT) encoding PEBP (phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein) domains in Allium cepa. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of FT-like proteins revealed six proteins that were identical to previously reported AcFT 1 - 6 proteins, {{as well as one}} (AcFT 7) with a highly conserved region shared with AcFT 6 and another (comp 106231) with low similarity to MFT protein, but containing a PEBP domain. Homology modelling of AcFT 7 proteins showed similar structures and conservation of amino acids crucial for function in AtFT (Arabidopsis) and Hd 3 a (rice), with variation in the C-terminal region. Further, we analyzed AcFT expression patterns in different transitional stages, as well as under SD (short-day), LD (long-day), and drought treatment in two contrasting genotypic lines EM (early maturation, 36101) and LM (late maturation, 36122). The FT transcript levels were greatly affected by various environmental factors such as photoperiod, temperature and drought. Our results suggest that AcFT 7 {{is a member of the}} FT-like genes in Allium cepa and may be involved in regulation of onion bulbing, similar to other FT genes. In addition, AcFT 4 and AcFT 7 could be involved in establishing the difference in timing of bulb maturity between the two contrasting onion lines...|$|E

To explore this, we compared the molecular biological basis of anthocyanin accumulation in both ERLC and the green leaf cotton variety CCRI 24 (Gossypium hirsutum L.). Introduction of R 2 R 3 -MYB transcription factor Rosea 1, the master regulator anthocyanin biosynthesis in Antirrhinum majus, into CCRI 24 induced anthocyanin accumulation, indicating structural genes for anthocyanin biosynthesis are not defected and the leaf coloration might be caused by variation of regulatory genes expression. Expression analysis found that a transcription factor RLC 1 (Red Leaf Cotton 1) which encodes the ortholog of PAP 1 /Rosea 1 was highly expressed in leaves of ERLC but barely expressed in CCRI 24 in light. Ectopic expression of RLC 1 from ERLC and CCRI 24 in hairy roots of Antirrhinum majus and CCRI 24 significantly enhanced anthocyanin accumulation. Comparison of RLC 1 promoter sequences between ERLC and CCRI 24 revealed two 228 -bp tandem repeats presented in ERLC with only one repeat in CCRI 24. Transient assays in cotton leave tissue evidenced that the tandem repeats in ERLC is responsible for light-induced RLC 1 expression and therefore anthocyanin accumulation. Taken together, our results in this article strongly support an important step toward understanding the role of R 2 R 3 -MYB transcription factors in the regulatory menchanisms of anthocyanin accumulation in red leaf cotton under light...|$|E

Many plants, including the Pooideae grasses, go through a cold acclimation (CA) process when exposed to low temperatures to acquire elevated levels of freezing tolerance. In four papers presented in this thesis we have investigated different genetic and evolutionary aspects of cold acclimation (CA) and freezing tolerance in Pooideae grasses. The two first papers (I and II) deal with transcriptional responses to low temperature exposure and association of genetic variation with freezing tolerance levels. We generated sequences from 372 transcribed genes putatively involved in CA in the perennial forage grass Festuca pratensis Huds [...] Seven of these genes were differentially regulated between plants with highand low freezing tolerance following CA, representing good candidates for further investigations into the mechanisms underlying phenotypic differences in freezing tolerance. We also analysed differences in genomic constitution of plants with divergent freezing tolerance in a Lolium x Festuca hybrid grass population using Diversity Array Technology (DArT) markers. Three regions on the Festuca and Lolium chromosomes 2, 4, and 7 contained DArT markers associated with the freezing tolerance phenotype. In Papers III and IV we take on a different angle and investigate patterns of molecular evolution in genes and genetic pathways involved in freezing tolerance in the entire Pooideae lineage. Evolution of a novel ice-binding domain and multiple Pooideae specific duplication of genes involved in freezing tolerance occurred in early Pooideae evolution. The initial duplication events giving birth to these Pooideae specific genes are clustered in the Eocene-Oligocene (E-O) global climate cooling period, ~ 34 - 26 million years (My) ago. We hypothesize that the E-O paleoclimatic shift was important in adaptive evolution of the molecular mechanisms fundamental for Pooideae freezing tolerance and adaptation to Cold climates...|$|E

A directed, rapid, and low-cost method is critical for updating high-yield, multi-stress resistant varieties. Molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) and genetic modification (GM) methods have advantages in capturing favorable agricultural traits. However, the targeted editing technology of key functional genes promises to be a powerful tool in accelerating varietal improvement. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have proven to be effective in plant-targeted genome editing (Chen and Gao [2013]; Li et al. [2012]; Shan et al. [2013 a]; Zhang et al. [2013]); however, a simple, affordable, and high-throughput method is still needed. Recently, the bacterial type II clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) system has attracted attention due to its ability to induce sequence-specific genome editing. The site specificity is defined by the complementary base pairing of a small CRISPR RNA (crRNA). After annealing to a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), the crRNA directly guides the Cas 9 endonuclease to cleave the target DNA sequence. In humans, zebrafish, Drosophila, mice, and rats, genome editing can be achieved by simply combining an engineered Streptococcus pyogenes Cas 9 (SpCas 9) and a synthetic single-guide RNA (sgRNA) consisting of the crRNA and the tracrRNA (Cong et al. [2013]; Feng et al. [2013]; Gratz et al. [2013]; Li et al. [2013 a]; Wang et al. [2013]; Xiao et al. [2013]). The CRISPR/Cas 9 -induced genome editing was also recently performed in model plants (e.g., Arabidopsis, Nicotiana benthamiana) and crops (including wheat, rice and sorghum) by transient or stable transformation (Belhaj et al. [2013]; Feng et al. [2013]; Jiang et al. [2013]; Li et al. [2013 b]; Mao et al. [2013]; Miao et al. [2013]; Nekrasov et al. [2013]; Shan et al. [2013 b]; Xie and Yang [2013]).

40|$|Leaf width is an {{important}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>trait</b> in maize. Leaf development is dependent on cell proliferation and expansion, and these processes exhibit polarity {{with respect to the}} longitudinal and transverse axes of the leaf. However, the molecular mechanism of the genetic control of seed vigor remains unknown in maize, and a better understanding of this mechanism is required. To reveal the genetic architecture of leaf width, a comprehensive evaluation using four RIL populations was performed, followed by a meta-analysis. Forty-six QTLs associated with the widths of leaves at different positions above the uppermost ear were detected in the four RIL populations in three environments. The individual effects of the QTLs ranged from 4. 33 % to 18. 01 % of the observed phenotypic variation, with 14 QTLs showing effects of over 10 %. We identified three common QTLs associated with leaf width at all of the examined positions, in addition to one common QTL associated with leaf width at three of the positions and six common QTLs associated with leaf width at two of the positions. The results indicate that leaf width at different leaf positions may be affected by one QTL or several of the same QTLs. Such traits may also be regulated by many different QTLs. Thirty-one of the forty-six initial QTLs were integrated into eight mQTLs through a meta-analysis, and 10 of the 14 initial QTLs presenting an R 2 > 10 % were integrated into six mQTLs. mQTL 1 - 2, mQTL 3 - 1, mQTL 7, and mQTL 8 were composed of the initial QTLs showing an R 2 > 10 % and included four to six of the initial QTLs that were associated with two to four positions in a single population. Therefore, these four chromosome regions may be hot spots for important QTLs for these traits. Thus, they warrant further studies and may be useful for marker-assisted breeding...|$|E

Most {{of the information}} on these traits has not previously been integrated into a genomic context. Without such integration application of these data to agricultural enterprises will remain slow and inefficient. Our goal was to populate a genomic database with data mined from the bovine quantitative trait literature and to make these data available in a genomic context to researchers via a user friendly query interface. Description The QTL (Quantitative Trait Locus) data and related information for bovine QTL are gathered from published work and from existing databases. An integrated database schema was designed and the database (MySQL) populated with the gathered data. The bovine QTL Viewer was developed for the integration of QTL data available for cattle. The tool consists of an integrated database of bovine QTL and the QTL viewer to display QTL and their chromosomal position.

40|$|This paper aims at {{investigating}} {{the impacts of}} different planting methods on the yield and Cluster Charactersin different irrigation conditions on wheat (cultivar of Chamran) in Khuzestan for one year in Shavoor agricultural farm located in 70 km north of Ahvaz which lies in E longitude 48 Û: 28 " and N latitude 31 Û: 50 " as split plots in a randomized complete blocks design with three replications. The main factor is planting method in two levels of linear and sprinkling, and the subsidiary factor comprises irrigation treatments and dry farming. Variance analysis results revealed that in both factors {{there is a significant}} effect in all characteristics is dependent upon genotype, while the interaction of the two factors was significant only on the characteristics of panicle number per square meter and seed number in each panicle. By examining the comparison of grain yield means and other <b>agricultural</b> <b>traits,</b> the highest significant numeric value belongs to linear planting, except for the panicle number per square meter that had completely reverse trends in both treatments. Ultimately it is concluded that besides economic considerations through decreasing the amount of seeds needed and the easier control of weeds, linear planting helps to increase grain yield by accurately adjusting the distance and depth with regard to th...|$|R
40|$|The oomycete Phytophthora infestans causes late blight of potato, {{which can}} {{completely}} destroy the crop. Therefore, {{for the past}} 160 years, late blight {{has been the most}} important potato disease worldwide. The identification of cultivars with high and durable field resistance to P. infestans is an objective of most potato breeding programs. This type of resistance is polygenic and therefore quantitative. Its evaluation requires multi-year and location trials. Furthermore, quantitative resistance to late blight correlates with late plant maturity, a negative <b>agricultural</b> <b>trait.</b> Knowledge of the molecular genetic basis of quantitative resistance to late blight not compromised by late maturity is very limited. It is however essential for developing diagnostic DNA markers that facilitate the efficient combination of superior resistance alleles in improved cultivars. We used association genetics in a population of 184 tetraploid potato cultivars in order to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with maturity corrected resistance (MCR) to late blight. The population was genotyped for almost 9000 SNPs from three different sources. The first source was candidate genes specifically selected for their function in the jasmonate pathway. The second source was novel candidate genes selected based on comparative transcript profiling (RNA-Seq) of groups of genotypes with contrasting levels of quantitative resistance to P. infestans. The third source was the first generation 8. 3 k SolCAP SNP genotyping array available in potato for genome wide association studies (GWAS). Twenty seven SNPs from all three sources showed robust association with MCR. Some of those were located in genes that are strong candidates for directly controlling quantitative resistance, based on functional annotation. Most important were: a lipoxygenase (jasmonate pathway), a 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (mevalonate pathway), a P 450 protein (terpene biosynthesis), a transcription factor and a homolog of a major gene for resistance to P. infestans from the wild potato species Solanum venturii. The candidate gene approach and GWAS complemented each other as they identified different genes. The results of this study provide new insight in the molecular genetic basis of quantitative resistance in potato and a toolbox of diagnostic SNP markers for breeding applications. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate if cryostorage of Phaseolus vulgaris L. seeds induced variations in regener ated plants at the phenotypic and molecular levels. A series of <b>agricultural</b> <b>traits</b> was measured on plants grown from control, non-cryopreserved and cryopreserved seeds, and the genetic stability of plants of the second generation was analysed at selected microsatellite loci. The phenotype of the second generation plants was evaluated as well. No statis tically significant phenotypic differences were observed for the parameters measured, neither in the first nor in the sec ond generations. Averaging both treatments, about 76 % of the seeds had germinated 10 days after sowing. At harvest we recorded plants with about 73 cm in height, 13 stem internodes, 25 fruits, 103 grains and 4 grains per fruit. One hundred seeds weighted about 26 g. The genetic analyses performed on the second generation plants using six nuclear Simple Sequences Repeats (SSR) markers revealed no changes in microsatellite length between control and cryopre served samples, implying {{that there was no}} effect of seed liquid nitrogen exposure on genome integrity. The phenotypic and molecular results reported here confirm that cryostorage is an efficient and reliable technique to conserve P. vul garis seeds and regenerate true-to-type plants. </p...|$|R
30|$|Scales of the teleost {{fish are}} {{important}} skin integumentary appendages distributed {{over the body}} surface in defined patterns. Natural variation in scale patterns exists among the common carp species. Mirror carp and Jianli are two carp varieties that have distinct scale patterns {{as a result of}} breeding selection. Scale initiation and morphogenesis are very complicated biological processes. The functional analysis of FGFR 1 by reverse genetics showed that the mutation of this gene can lead to reduced scales and abnormal fins (Rohner et al. 2009). The scale is one of the important <b>agricultural</b> <b>traits</b> for fishes and play important roles in physiology, defense, and adaptation to new environments (Sire et al. 1997). Some aquatic biologists are interested in scale development and launched some works using the reverse genetics. However, a complete knowledge of scale development is limited due to the longer sexual maturation period and the larger genome size for many species in fishes. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms underlying the scale initiation and pattern formation remain unknown. Using Genefishing, we were able to identify seven genes that were differentially expressed in Jianli and mirror carp skin tissues (Table  2). These genes may contribute to the morphogenesis of the integumentary appendages, especially the scales or fins, the functional analysis of these seven genes will be performed in future studies.|$|R
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Artificial {{selection}} {{played an}} important role in the origin of modern Glycine max cultivars from the wild soybean Glycine soja. To elucidate the consequences of artificial selection accompanying the domestication and modern improvement of soybean, 25 new and 30 published whole-genome re-sequencing accessions, which represent wild, domesticated landrace, and Chinese elite soybean populations were analyzed. 				 				 					 						Results 					A total of 5, 102, 244 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 707, 969 insertion/deletions were identified. Among the SNPs detected, 25. 5 % were not described previously. We found that artificial selection during domestication led to more pronounced reduction in the genetic diversity of soybean than the switch from landraces to elite cultivars. Only a small proportion (2. 99 %) of the whole genomic regions appear to be affected by artificial selection for preferred <b>agricultural</b> <b>traits.</b> The selection regions were not distributed randomly or uniformly throughout the genome. Instead, clusters of selection hotspots in certain genomic regions were observed. Moreover, a set of candidate genes (4. 38 % of the total annotated genes) significantly affected by selection underlying soybean domestication and genetic improvement were identified. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					Given the uniqueness of the soybean germplasm sequenced, this study drew a clear picture of human-mediated evolution of the soybean genomes. The genomic resources and information provided by this study would also facilitate the discovery of genes/loci underlying agronomically important traits...|$|R
40|$|Poster Session - Biosynthesis: Early Steps and Isoprene Formation: no. P. 027 Due to the {{importance}} of plant isoprenoids, several attempts had been made to achieve some overproduction. Rate-limiting reactions in the MVA pathway like that catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase were initially considered, also of enzymes downstream. In previous work we had studied the role and kinetics of the second enzyme in the MVA pathway, HMG-CoA synthase in Brassica juncea (BjHMGS 1), including the effect of targeted mutation of several amino acid residues and could generate an enzyme with higher catalytic efficiency in vitro. WT BjHMGS 1 and BjHMGS 1 S 393 A were transformed into Arabidopsis, resulting in positive effects such as an increased resistance to stress. This has been extended to tobacco over-expressing wild-type (OE-wtBjHMGS 1) and mutant BjHMGSS 359 A (OE-S 359 A), which resulted in higher accumulation of total phytosterols than in the vector-transformed control, with OE-S 359 A showing some higher sterol increase than OE-wtBjHMGS 1. The over-expression of HMGS up-regulated several downstream genes in the isoprenoid pathway and was found to accelerate and promote plant growth, leading to a higher yield of seeds, which both are interesting <b>agricultural</b> <b>traits.</b> The role of HMGSfor plant growth is supported by the existence of natural inhibitors like F- 244, efficiently retarding growth of B juncea seedlings and tobacco BY 2 cells...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{important}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>traits</b> such as weight gain, {{milk fat}} content and intramuscular fat (marbling) in cattle are quantitative traits. Most {{of the information}} on these traits has not previously been integrated into a genomic context. Without such integration application of these data to agricultural enterprises will remain slow and inefficient. Our goal was to populate a genomic database with data mined from the bovine quantitative trait literature and to make these data available in a genomic context to researchers via a user friendly query interface. DESCRIPTION: The QTL (Quantitative Trait Locus) data and related information for bovine QTL are gathered from published work and from existing databases. An integrated database schema was designed and the database (MySQL) populated with the gathered data. The bovine QTL Viewer was developed for the integration of QTL data available for cattle. The tool consists of an integrated database of bovine QTL and the QTL viewer to display QTL and their chromosomal position. CONCLUSION: We present a web accessible, integrated database of bovine (dairy and beef cattle) QTL for use by animal geneticists. The viewer and database are of general applicability to any livestock species for which there are public QTL data. The viewer can be accessed at [URL] Polineni, Prathyusha Aragonda, Suresh R Xavier, Richard Furuta and David L Adelso...|$|R
