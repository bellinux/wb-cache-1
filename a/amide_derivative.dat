The separation between the naphthyl fluorophores and the hydrogen-bonding sites within the chiral cavity can be tuned to recognize guest amines with similar separation between aryl groups and hydrogen-bonding sites.

The pathogenic fungus {{is responsible for}} {{billions of dollars in}} economic losses worldwide each year. In order to discover new fungicidal molecule with good fungicidal activity against G. zeae, F. oxysporum, and C. mandshurica, we sought to combine the active sub-structure of hydrazone and pyrazole <b>amide</b> <b>derivatives</b> together to design and synthesize novel pyrazole <b>amide</b> <b>derivatives</b> containing a hydrazone moiety. Results A series of novel pyrazole <b>amide</b> <b>derivatives</b> bearing hydrazone moiety were synthesized.
