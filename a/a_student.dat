40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{relationship}} between a tutor’s advice and <b>a</b> <b>student’s</b> questionings, and the way in which it develops <b>a</b> <b>student’s</b> self-regulation skill. Firstly we offer that a tutor’s advice is one component that trains <b>a</b> <b>student’s</b> self-regulation skill. Through analysis of interactive learning opportunities between academic departments, we discovered that a tutor’s advice transformed <b>a</b> <b>student’s</b> questionings. This transformation indicates an appropriation by the student of the tutor’s self-regulation skill. We propose a model for further development of <b>a</b> <b>student’s</b> self-regulation skill, which is based on the appropriation by the student of the tutor’s self-regulation skill...|$|R
