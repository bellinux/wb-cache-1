5|$|Another of Dannatt's {{priorities}} was {{tackling the}} perception of the British operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> the news media and the British public were unaware of the purpose or the intensity of the missions. Disgruntled by increasingly negative coverage, he interrupted a family holiday in Cornwall to fly to Afghanistan in an effort to change the coverage through a series of interviews. During the visit, he managed to meet with his son, Bertie, who was serving in the country with the Grenadier Guards. Later in 2007, Dannatt raised the same issue in a lecture to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Earlier that year, Dannatt had taken the decision not to allow Prince Harry to serve in Iraq. However, after Dannatt had brokered an understanding with the British press, Harry was able to serve in Afghanistan for three months in late 2007 and early 2008 until the story broke and he was ordered home.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian {{position}} on any offensive move {{was made clear}} by Leopold III. As far <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> the Belgian Army could not conduct offensive operations as it lacked tanks and aircraft; it existed solely for defence. The King also made clear that in the rapidly shrinking area of Belgium still free, there was only enough food for two weeks. Leopold did not expect the BEF to jeopardize its own position {{in order to keep}} contact with the Belgian Army, but he warned the British that if it persisted with the southern offensive the Belgians would be overstretched and their army would collapse. King Leopold suggested the best recourse was to establish a beach-head covering Dunkirk and the Belgian channel ports. The will of the CIGS won out. Gort committed just two infantry battalions and the only armoured battalion in the BEF to the attack, which despite some initial tactical success, failed to break the German defensive line at the Battle of Arras on 21 May.|$|E

But this name still won by a majority vote and was selected. The competition guaranteed fixtures and members for all of its member clubs. The clubs were split equally among North and Midlands teams. It excluded Southern teams, who were still strictly amateur.|$|E

25|$|Hart {{was furious}} over the {{official}} decision and argued with the officials {{claiming that he}} should be declared the winner and not Austin. On the following night's Raw, Hart came to the ring unannounced {{at the beginning of the}} show and began venting his frustrations toward Vince McMahon over how he believed that the finish to the Royal Rumble was just another in a long string of screwings and broken promises that had been dogging Hart since he returned to the company. He demanded that he receive the title shot that the winner of the Royal Rumble is entitled to, saying that as far <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> he won the match. McMahon simply ignored him and walked to his broadcast position, and an incensed Hart finally decided he had had enough and declared he was quitting the WWF.|$|E
25|$|Lord Chelmsford, the Commander-in-Chief of British forces {{during the}} war, {{initially}} planned a five-pronged invasion of Zululand consisting of over 15,000 troops in five columns {{and designed to}} encircle the Zulu army and force it to fight <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> that the Zulus would avoid battle, slip around the invaders and over the Tugela, and strike at Natal. Lord Chelmsford settled on three invading columns with the main centre column, now consisting of some 7,800 men comprising the previously called No. 3 Column, commanded by the Colonel of the 24th Richard Glynn, and Durnford's No.2 Column, under his direct command. He moved his troops from Pietermaritzburg to a forward camp at Helpmekaar, past Greytown. On 9 January 1879 they moved to Rorke's Drift, and early on 11 January commenced crossing the Buffalo River into Zululand.|$|E
25|$|At the time, Bourguiba and {{his friends}} of L'Action Tunisienne saw the Destour as lacking firmness. Nevertheless, it {{developed}} an organization with 90 local representatives from throughout the country. It had not grown since the arrival of Manceron {{at the head of}} the Residence. Recruiting among lower classes as well as the bourgeois classes, the new distinction among the Destour permitted them to have a strong position and influence the party in order to unify all factions of the nationalist front. Responding to the wishes of Bourguiba, many delegates supported this union. However, in 1933, it was not yet Bourguiba but Mahmoud El Materi who appeared to be the leader of L'Action group. This man who proved himself to be an active man of science in the French communist party and ended up as a delegate during the Tours Congress. He expressed his will not to become a politician. As far <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> tolerance, the sense of honour, solidarity, spirit, and justice overrode tactics, cynicism, provocation, and low blows. His qualities and charisma allowed him to forge a strong position within the Destour in which he was unanimous.|$|E

Alfred Rosenberg, serving {{as head of}} the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories, favoured a more moderate policy. After touring collective farms around Vinnytsia, Ukraine, Bormann was concerned about the health and good physical constitution of the population, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> that they could constitute a danger to the regime.

The New York Post reported that according to sources the split was not about [...] "irresolvable personality conflicts" [...] but about the money; a friend of Cornell said, [...] "Chris was unhappy with the financial arrangement within the group—he wrote all the music, yet the other three bandmates took an equal share in the multimillion-dollar publishing rights." ...|$|E

Co-writer Teddy Riley, who was quoted to have said so {{in an interview with}} the Los Angeles Times in 1996, denied in a 2011 reply to a fan on Twitter that the song was about Rowe. Others have noted that when the single was originally released in 1992, Jackson dedicated the song to Diana Ross, including Jermaine Jackson, who in his book You Are Not Alone: [...] Michael: [...] Through a Brother's Eyes wrote, [...] "...that song was, as Michael told me, written with Diana Ross in mind; the one great love that, as far <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> escaped him." ...|$|E
500|$|AOC 11 Group Keith Park was livid {{with the}} claim returns. As far <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> {{claiming}} 200 {{on one day}} was nonsense. He placed particular blame on Leigh-Mallory's Big Wing which had claimed one third, around 60, of the 185 'victories' (total claims were 81 {{in the morning and}} 104 in the afternoon). More damage should have been done to German bombers inbound to the target rather than destroying stragglers that were no military threat {{as they made their way}} to the coast. He complained that there were too many inexperienced leaders and interceptions were being missed. Things needed [...] "tightening up", that was Park's lesson for 15 September. Park was aware the ratio of losses was 2:1 in the British favour. It had been a decent performance, but not Fighter Command's best.|$|E
500|$|The issue {{concerned}} Hand {{again during}} the New Deal period, when the Supreme Court repeatedly overturned or blocked Franklin D. Roosevelt's legislation. As an instinctive democrat, Hand was appalled that an elected government should have its laws struck down in this way. He viewed it as a judicial [...] "usurpation" [...] for the Supreme Court to {{assume the role of}} a third chamber in these cases. As far <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> the Constitution already provided a full set of checks and balances on legislation. Nevertheless, Hand did not hesitate to condemn Roosevelt's frustrated attempt to pack the Supreme Court in 1937, which led commentators to warn of totalitarianism. The answer, for Hand, lay in the separation of powers: courts should be independent and act on the legislation of elected governments.|$|E

500|$|Production {{started again}} {{later that year}} when the {{producers}} hired the relatively unknown British television director Peter Webber to head the project, despite his not having directed a feature film before. Tucker and Paterson already knew Webber from several earlier projects; the director discovered the project by accident after visiting their office, where he noticed a poster of Vermeer's work and began discussing it. Webber read the script and described it as being [...] "... about creativity and the link between art and money and power and sex in some strange unholy mixture." [...] Characterising it as a [...] "coming of age" [...] story with a [...] "fascinating dark undertow," [...] Webber deliberately did not read the book prior to filming, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> about being influenced by it, opting instead {{to rely on the}} script and the period.|$|E

Soderbergh also noted Mitch's [...] "common individual" [...] lack of medical and scientific knowledge, though keeping the situation dynamic and compelling was challenging for the director, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> that Emhoff would be a one-dimensional character. Soderbergh felt that Damon understood the concept and addressed the producers' concerns. [...] "You never catch him acting", said Soderbergh. [...] "There's no vanity, no self-consciousness in his performance; it's as if the cameras aren't there." [...] Writer Scott Z. Burns sent him a copy of the script with a [...] "read this and then go wash your hands" [...] note attached to it. Damon recalled: [...] "I just really want to be in this movie.

500|$|Evans {{returned}} to Australia in 1980 {{to compete at}} the Australian Championships, which doubled as the Olympic trials. His sojourn in the United Kingdom meant {{that he was a}} virtual unknown in his home country. He set a national record in winning the 100m breaststroke in a time of 1m 4.80s and also qualified for his less preferred 200m event. During the Olympic training camp in Brisbane, the Australian coaches tried to get Evans to cover more mileage at training. Evans' teammates recalled him stopping during a pool session and emphatically proclaiming that [...] "Work is a poor substitute for talent". In 2000, more than a decade after his retirement, he was still using this slogan. Evans was confident in his own training methods and refused to bend to the coaches. His teammate Mark Tonelli said that Evans [...] "knew what he was capable of and as far <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> he was capable of anything".|$|E

500|$|He {{had known}} {{producer}} D.C. Fontana for several years, and pitched his story directly to her. In turn, she relayed {{it to the}} franchise creator Gene Roddenberry, who called Schmerer back for a meeting. Together they re-wrote the story during the meeting to make it fit within the 30-minute-long animated episode. Schmerer explained that Roddenberry appreciated {{the idea of an}} alien pretending to be other characters, and that the animated series could easily show the shapeshifter undergo the various changes in the episode. The design of the Vendorian had been described by Schmerer in the script, but was changed to the squid-like design by the animators, a change that Schmerer described as [...] "neat" [...] and [...] "clever". In the original outline, the Vendorian didn't assume the role of Kirk. Added by Roddenberry, Schmerer did not agree with the change. Roddenberry and Schemerer argued about the point, with Roddenberry saying that Kirk was the star of the series while Schmerer wanted it to be different <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> that its plot would appear too similar to the events of [...] "" [...] where Garth of Izar changes his appearance to become Kirk.|$|E
500|$|To Britain's {{alarm and}} indignation, the Portuguese {{government}} announced on 21 September that Nogueira had accepted [...] "a letter of introduction" [...] from Reedman, conferring upon him the title [...] "Chief of the Rhodesian Mission", with powers {{to deal with}} the Portuguese Foreign Ministry in Luso-Rhodesian matters without British interference. This followed the precedent set by Reedman's counterpart in South Africa, the statement said. Speaking publicly in Salisbury the same evening, Dupont told reporters that there had never been any intention to claim ambassadorial status for Reedman, and that Rhodesia had constantly kept Britain informed of what was happening regarding the appointment. So far <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> he said, the Rhodesian government had achieved its objective of attaining an independent diplomatic representative in Portugal, and had not exceeded its mandate in any way while doing so. Britain protested strenuously, saying Portugal was going back on its word. Portugal insisted that its reception of Reedman and his Lisbon mission did not prejudice Britain's responsibility over Rhodesia, and was justified because of the long-standing ties between Portugal and Rhodesia, as well as their common involvement in many southern African issues.|$|E
