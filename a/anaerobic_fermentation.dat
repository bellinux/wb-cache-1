5|$|The {{amount of}} energy {{released}} by oxidative phosphorylation is high, compared with the amount produced by <b>anaerobic</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Glycolysis produces only 2 ATP molecules, but somewhere between 30 and 36 ATPs are produced by the oxidative phosphorylation of the 10 NADH and 2 succinate molecules made by converting one molecule of glucose to carbon dioxide and water, while each cycle of beta oxidation of a fatty acid yields about 14 ATPs. These ATP yields are theoretical maximum values; in practice, some protons leak across the membrane, lowering the yield of ATP.|$|E

25|$|When used as feed for dairy cattle, alfalfa {{is often}} made into haylage {{by a process}} known as ensiling. Rather than being dried to make dry hay, the alfalfa is chopped finely and {{fermented}} in silos, trenches, or bags, where the oxygen supply can be limited to promote fermentation. The <b>anaerobic</b> <b>fermentation</b> of alfalfa allows it to retain high nutrient levels similar to those of fresh forage, and is also more palatable to dairy cattle than dry hay. In many cases, alfalfa silage is inoculated with different strains of microorganisms to improve the fermentation quality and aerobic stability of the silage.|$|E
30|$|Current {{fermentation}} {{processes for}} the production of itaconic acid from sugar are executed aerobically using oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor (Kuenz et al. 2012). Aerobic processes result in higher operating and capital costs compared to anaerobic processes due to the lower yields and increased demands for oxygen and heat transfer (Cuellar et al. 2013; Zeikus 1980). Because of this, Zeikus (1980) stated that <b>anaerobic</b> <b>fermentations</b> form the basis for microbial production of chemicals and fuels. It is therefore interesting to design an anaerobic process for itaconic acid production.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} of work carried out on dextransucrase production, purification, immobilization and reactions has been carried out. A brief review has also been made of the literature concerning general enzyme biotechnology and fermentation technology. Fed-batch fermentation of the bacteria Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B 512 (F) to produce dextransucrase has formed the major part of this research. Aerobic and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>fermentations</b> have been studied using a 16 litre New Brunswick fermenter which has a 3 - 12 litre working volume. The initial volume of broth used in the studies was 6 litres. The results of the fed-batch fermentations showed {{for the first time that}} yields of dextransucrase are much higher under the anaerobic conditions than during the aerobic fermentations. Dextransucrase containing 300 - 350 DSU/cm 3 of enzyme activity has been obtained during the aerobic fermentations, while in the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>fermentations,</b> enzyme yields containing 450 - 500 DSU/cm 3 have been obtained routinely. The type of yeast extract used in the fermentation medium has been found to have significant effects on enzyme yield. Of the different types studied, the Gistex Standard was found to be the type that favoured the highest enzyme production. Studies have also been carried out on the effect of agitation rate and antifoam on the enzyme production during the anaerobic experiments. Agitation rates of up to 600 rpm were found not to affect the enzyme yield, however, the presence of antifoam in the medium led to a significant reduction in enzyme activity (less than 300 DSU/cm 3). Scale-up of the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>fermentations</b> has been performed at up to the 1000 litre level with enzyme yields containing more than 400 DSU/cm 3 of activity being produced. Some of the enzyme produced at this scale was used for the first time to produce dextran on an industrial scale via the enzyme route, with up to 99 % conversion of sucrose to dextran being obtained. An attempt has been made at continuous dextransucrase production. Cell washout was observed to occur at dilution rates of greater than 0. 4 h- 1.

25|$|Benzoic {{acid and}} its salts {{are used as}} a food preservatives, {{represented}} by the E-numbers E210, E211, E212, and E213. Benzoic acid inhibits the growth of mold, yeast and some bacteria. It is either added directly or created from reactions with its sodium, potassium, or calcium salt. The mechanism starts with the absorption of benzoic acid into the cell. If the intracellular pH changes to 5 or lower, the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>fermentation</b> of glucose through phosphofructokinase is decreased by 95%. The efficacy of benzoic acid and benzoate is thus dependent on the pH of the food. Acidic food and beverage like fruit juice (citric acid), sparkling drinks (carbon dioxide), soft drinks (phosphoric acid), pickles (vinegar) or other acidified food are preserved with benzoic acid and benzoates.|$|E
500|$|A {{dominant}} {{role for the}} mitochondria is the production of ATP, as reflected by {{the large number of}} proteins in the inner membrane for this task. This is done by oxidizing the major products of glucose: pyruvate, and NADH, which are produced in the cytosol. This type of cellular respiration known as aerobic respiration, is dependent on the presence of oxygen. When oxygen is limited, the glycolytic products will be metabolized by <b>anaerobic</b> <b>fermentation,</b> a process that is independent of the mitochondria. The production of ATP from glucose has an approximately 13-times higher yield during aerobic respiration compared to fermentation. Recently {{it has been shown that}} plant mitochondria can produce a limited amount of ATP without oxygen by using the alternate substrate nitrite.

However, the fermentations of Chtioui et al. and Coutte et al. lasted comparatively longer (72  h instead of 55  h). Aerobic fermentations with Bacillus subtilis using foam fractionation take much shorter time (30  h) and yield much higher concentrations in foam (3.995  g/L). Values for YX/S differ only slightly between the foam-free processes (0.120  g/g – 0.189  g/g), but are relatively low compared to cultivations applying foam fractionation (0.268  g/g). The results for volumetric production rates are very similar, too, between the foam-free fermentations (0.002  g/(L∙h) – 0.003  g/(L∙h)). The foam fractionation fermentation reached a much higher value for vol. qSurfactin in comparison (0.018  g/(L∙h)). The product yield in contrast to substrate utilization is given by the parameter YP/S. The values for cultivations of Chtioui et al. and Coutte et al. are both 0.013  g/g. The current study reached a much higher value of 0.033  g/g for YP/S. However, fermentations employing foam fractionation still yield higher YP/S values (0.052  g/g).

In contrast, <b>anaerobic</b> <b>fermentations</b> of the current study employing 2.5  g/L glucose yielded 0.278  g/g.
