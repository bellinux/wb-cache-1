[...] On Carey's official Facebook page on May 12, 2012, shortly after the release, she wrote, [...] "I spent four years writing this song, only because after I performed in Schenectady, NY, I started hearing this melody and singing {{it over and over}} to myself as I was taking a bath, looking at the moon.. Four years later, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> a devastating part of my life behind, I wrote the second verse, the bridge and the outro." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1888, {{newly married}} and having moved to Manhattan [...] from her parents' home, Cotton sought {{to become a}} student of William Merritt Chase. He agreed to teach her {{and at the same}} time asked whether she would sit for a portrait. In 1908 Chase {{described}} the meeting: [...] "One morning a young lady came into my Tenth street studio, just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> for an art class in Brooklyn. She came as a pupil, but the moment she appeared before me I saw her only as a splendid model. Half way to the elevated station I stopped, hastened back, and overtook her. She consented to sit for me; and I painted that day, without an interruption, till late in the evening. The result is the Lady in Black, now hung in the Metropolitan Museum." [...] In 1889 a second Chase portrait of her, [...] "Lady in Pink," [...] was shown at the Spring Exhibition at the National Academy of Design in New York.|$|E

6000|$|... 'They are all my charge,' said Mr. Audley; 'and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>leaving</b> you {{the whole}} burthen of the rest, and my poor little godson {{is not likely to}} want such care, you need have no scruple. One of the Somervilles is going out to a Government office at Albertstown, and perhaps may put me in the way of doing {{something}} for him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good, uncle," [...] Mary said, gratefully. [...] "And you must {{remember}} it isn't <b>as</b> though <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>leaving</b> you alone. You have the girls." ...|$|R
6000|$|Good people fare ye well; bad <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> many worse behind me. I {{hope you}} shall see me die like a man, {{the death of}} a dog. [...] E. E.|$|R
60|$|Just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> the hotel, I saw her maid {{coming down}} the hall with a note in her hand. I waited, and she accosted me.|$|E
6000|$|... “That was afterwards, my lord, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> the Speculative. I said I {{had been}} to see the miserable {{creature}} hanged, and my gorge rose at it.” ...|$|E
60|$|The elder doctor left {{in charge}} heard the words, and {{answered}} them, addressing himself, not to Mr. Engelman, but to me. He caught {{me by the}} arm, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> the room in my turn.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, {{a day or}} two after, I {{enclosed}} it to her in a hasty note, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> then <b>leaving</b> London for Paris, and had not yet {{had time}} fully to consider the subject.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never want}} to be happier, sir, than I have been," [...] replied Mr. Warrington; [...] "and I hope you will let me say, that <b>I</b> feel <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>leaving</b> quite old friends behind me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Forgive me {{and forget}} {{me as soon}} <b>as</b> possible. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>leaving</b> you for ever. Do not look for me, it <b>is</b> useless. <b>I</b> have become a witch from the grief and calamities that have struck me. It's {{time for me to}} go. Farewell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How did {{you know}} I had it? If it hadn't been for her, I shouldn't have brought any. She put it into my pocket just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving.</b> She said you would all {{want to see what}} she looked like." ...|$|E
6000|$|The rain {{imprinted}} the step's wet shine With target-circles that quivered {{and crossed}} <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> this porch of mine; When from within there swelled and paused [...] A song's sweet note; [...] And back I turned, and thought, [...] "Here I'll abide." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'He {{sprang up}} from the ground somewhere <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> the outpost,' he said. 'I believe he was making for it, for he walked blindly into my horse. He got hold of my leg and of course none of our chaps dared touch him then.' ...|$|E
5000|$|The first {{mention of}} the club {{is to be found}} in a letter to the Evening Gazette dated 23 November 1920 when Mr H.L.De Roper, who was staying at the Coatham Hotel, wrote to the editor {{suggesting}} that it was time that the town of Redcar had its own rugby club. [...] "I am only a temporary resident at Redcar, so cannot take the initiative myself, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure a XV could be raised in the town if someone would take the matter in hand. Perhaps, sir, you would help by publishing this letter, and a meeting of anyone interested could <b>be</b> arranged, but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>leaving</b> the town this week for some time I cannot take the lead myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was so {{strongly}} interested by this narrative, that I determined immediately to prosecute my acquaintance with Helen Walker; but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to <b>leave</b> the country next day, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> obliged to defer it till my return in spring, {{when the first}} walk <b>I</b> took <b>was</b> to Helen Walker's cottage.|$|R
6000|$|... "As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to <b>leave</b> my bed, well-meaning people, {{in and out}} of {{the medical}} profession, {{combined}} to torment me with the best intentions.|$|R
60|$|The {{merchant}} {{asked me}} for one of my cards <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving,</b> for he said I should be something to talk of in the future, and desired {{me to make a}} note of his request and reason; a desire with which I have thus complied.|$|E
6000|$|... “Sure. I got the tip by ‘phone <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving.</b> Whatcom serves me pretty well, {{but there}} are other fellows to take a hand in the game, and the news will leak out some time this evening. We’re an hour or two ahead—that’s all. Here, write your message.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘It {{seems we}} were predestined to be acquaintances!’ I exclaimed. ‘I have here a card {{in my pocket}} {{intended}} for you. It is from my family lawyer. It was his last word, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving,</b> to ask to be remembered kindly, and to trust you would pass over so informal an introduction.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have a kind}} of presentiment,--not that I shall die, {{but that}} I shall never see Scroope again. It seems <b>as</b> though <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{certainly}} <b>leaving</b> for ever a place that has always been distasteful to me." ...|$|R
60|$|However, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not writing}} an essay, or I {{should have a}} great deal more to say on this point; <b>as</b> it <b>is</b> <b>I</b> must <b>leave</b> it for abler hands, and go back to my story.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Consider, my Mansoul: would thou wert as {{loath to}} <b>leave</b> me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> loath to <b>leave</b> thee.

6000|$|LORD GORING. Because it is found. In {{point of}} fact, I found it myself, and stupidly {{forgot to tell}} the butler {{anything}} about it <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving.</b> [Goes over to the writing-table and pulls out the drawers.] It is in this drawer. No, that one. This is the brooch, isn’t it? [Holds up the brooch.] ...|$|E
6000|$|Their {{house was}} large and its {{grandeur}} was almost oppressive to me, but I spent nearly a week in it. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving,</b> Bashford gave me a card to Dr. Cross, a former parishioner in Jamaica Plain, saying, [...] "Call upon the Doctor {{as soon as you}} return. He'll be glad to hear of Dakota." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> {{the gallery}} I had a last glimpse of her, {{sitting there with}} drawn face and haggard eyes that {{followed}} me as I passed from her sight, whilst Ramiro del' Orca stood beside her murmuring words that did not reach me. His so-called courtiers and his men-at-arms were trooping out of the room, no doubt in obedience to his dismissal.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] I answered; [...] "it {{does not}} weigh anything, and I can sling it over my shoulder.

6000|$|... "Jolliffe {{came and}} told me"--Jolliffe, <b>I</b> should explain, <b>was</b> the bailiff,--"that if I didn't like it <b>as</b> it <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> might <b>leave</b> it, {{and that the}} squire could get double the rent for it.

5000|$|On 26 September 2011, Hevypetal {{announced}} that vocalist Curtis Moore <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> the band.

6000|$|One day <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> Hurd's {{office he}} said, [...] "By the way, Garland, {{you ought to}} know Jim Herne.

6000|$|... "I've just trodden {{with all}} my weight on the foot of an eminent {{publisher}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> my seat," [...] she cried, with a peal of delighted laughter.

60|$|When {{we stopped}} the operation, he {{attended}} to Lucy, whilst I applied digital pressure {{to my own}} incision.

60|$|Dear Mother--I am {{off in a}} day or two {{to visit}} some new country; I haven't yet decided which. I have {{satisfied}} myself with regard to France, and obtained a good knowledge of the language. I have enjoyed my visit to Madame de Maisonrouge deeply, and feel <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>leaving</b> a circle of real friends. Everything has gone on beautifully up to the end, and every one has been as kind and attentive <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> their own sister, especially Mr. Verdier, the French gentleman, from whom I have gained more than I ever expected (in six weeks), and with whom I have promised to correspond. So you can imagine me dashing off the most correct French letters; and, if you don't believe it, I will keep the rough draft to show you when I go back.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was blown}} hither {{in a great}} storm that injured my flier and carried me I knew not where. I came down into the valley at night for food and drink.

I do not know why they took me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing no harm. All <b>I</b> ask <b>is</b> that you let me go my way in peace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{may have}} to hurt you worse than this presently," [...] said the philosopher imperturbably as he dragged Beresteyn--who by now felt dizzy and helpless--to the nearest chair and {{deposited}} him there.
