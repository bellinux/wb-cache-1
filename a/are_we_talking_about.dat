50|$|Contemporary African art is {{commonly}} understood as art made by artists in Africa and the African diaspora in the post-independence era. However, {{there are about}} as many understandings of contemporary African art as there are curators, scholars and artists working in that field. All three terms of this “wide-reaching noncategory sic” are problematic in themselves: What exactly is ‘contemporary’, what makes art ‘African’, and when <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> art and not {{any other kind of}} creative expression? Western scholars and curators have made numerous attempts at defining contemporary African art in the 1990s and early 2000s and proposed a range of categories and genres. They triggered heated debates and controversies especially on the foundations of postcolonial critique. Recent trends indicate a far more relaxed engagement with definitions and identity ascriptions. The global presence and entanglement of Africa and its contemporary artists have become a widely acknowledged fact that still requires and provokes critical reflection but finds itself beyond the pressure of self-justification.|$|E
