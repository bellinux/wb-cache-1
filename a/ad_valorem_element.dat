After showing that the optimal two-part <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> licensing scheme reduces to a pure <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> royalty scheme, we show that per-unit contracts are typically preferred to <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> contracts by the patentee, as, under price competition, the per-unit royalty has a stronger strategic effect than the <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> royalty.

The paper shows that governments endogenously choose <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tax not because of a classic welfare reason, {{but because it is}} a good strategy in competing for mobile customers. Another key finding is that while governments are committed to the <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tax method, the choice is not efficient; Tax-cutting competition becomes more serious when countries adopt <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tax, and competition in <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tax yields smaller payoffs than competition in unit tax...|$|R

An <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tax is commonly levied on both real and personal property. A {{property tax}} is based upon a property's market value. The <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tax levy is based upon a millage rate which never varies from parcel to parcel.

40|$|International audienceWe compare various {{designs of}} energy {{efficiency}} subsidies {{in a market}} subject to both energy-use externalities and price-quality discrimination by a monopolist. We find that differentiated subsidies can establish the social optimum. Unlike per-quality regimes, <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> regimes generate downstream interferences: Subsidising of the high-end good leads the monopolist to reduce {{the quality of the}} low-end good. For this reason, <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> differentiated rates should always decrease with energy efficiency, a result seemingly at odds with actual practice. In contrast, with per-quality differentiated subsidies, the rates can increase if the externality is large enough relative to the market share of "low" type consumers. Contrary to differentiated subsidies, what we shall call single-instrument subsidies only achieve second-best outcomes. A uniform <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> subsidy should have a rate higher than that needed to specifically internalise energy-use externalities. Lastly, if, as is often observed in practice, only the high-end good is to be incentivised, a per-quality regime should be preferred to an <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> one. An <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tax on the high-end good may even be preferred to an <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> subsidy if the externality is small enough and low-end consumers dominate the market. © 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|This paper studies {{commodity}} taxation when firms use two-part tariffs {{in model}} of competition A la Hotelling. Three kinds of taxes are considered: a specific tax, an <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> {{one on the}} subscription fee and an <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> one on the per usage fee. We first derive the equilibrium tariffs, market shares and profits. We show that the tax on the subscription fee is profit neutral (unlike the other two) but socially costly (like the other two) as it modifies the consumption choice of the consumers. In a context of costly public funds the <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> taxation on the variable fee dominates specific taxation. Moreover, the ranking between <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> taxation on the fixed fee and an <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> taxation on the variable fee depends on the relative magnitude of economic parameters, in particular the degree of differentation. Finally, we show that the government might prefer the use of two-part tariffs rather than the use of more general tariffs. two-parts tariffs, commodity taxation...|$|R
