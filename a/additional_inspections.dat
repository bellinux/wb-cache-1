The batteries were assembled on 7 March and transported to the Penang Cargo Complex to be transported by MASkargo—Malaysia Airlines' cargo subsidiary—to be loaded onto a lorry to transport it to Kuala Lumpur International Airport and onwards by air to Beijing. At the Penang Cargo Complex, the consignment was inspected by MASkargo employees and Malaysian customs officials, but did not go through a security screening before the truck was sealed for transfer to the airport. The consignment did not go through any <b>additional</b> <b>inspections</b> at Kuala Lumpur International Airport before it was loaded onto Flight 370. Because the batteries were packaged in accordance with IATA guidelines, they were not regulated as dangerous goods. Lithium-ion batteries can cause intense fires if they overheat and ignite, which has led to strict regulations on their transport aboard aircraft. A fire fuelled by {{lithium-ion batteries}} caused the crash of UPS Airlines Flight 6, and lithium-ion batteries are suspected to have caused a fire which resulted in the crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 991; both were cargo aircraft. Some airlines have stopped carrying bulk shipments of lithium-ion batteries on passenger aircraft, citing safety concerns.|$|E
2500|$|Discovery later {{rolled out}} from the VAB to Launch Complex 39A on 4 August 2009, in a slow drive {{on the top of}} the Crawler-transporter. The [...] rollout began at 02:07 EDT, and ended with the launch {{platform}} secured in place at about 13:50 EDT. The move took longer than expected due to adverse weather conditions, which included lightning warnings. The crawler also had to pause occasionally so mud could be removed from its treads and bearings. Technicians then quickly prepared the shuttle to host the crew’s countdown dress rehearsal known as the Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test (TCDT). Discovery’s seven astronauts flew to Kennedy on 5 August 2009 for the training activity which concludes later in the week with a complete practice countdown, minus liftoff, involving the crew and the launch team. Meanwhile, in an unprecedented operation, modifications were made to the left Solid rocket booster on the pad. The modifications involved replacement of a check valve filter assembly in the booster which was found to have broken. In a potentially delaying factor, in depth testing of the external tank with X-ray revealed voids in the foam which might have formed during the injection molding of the foam. This has also been decided as a suspect factor in the foam shedding during STS-127. The air in the voids could have expanded due to the high temperatures generated during ascent thus breaking the foam. The reviews considered a rollback as an option since the defect could not be set right in the pad. Later, the tank was cleared for launch as is without any <b>additional</b> <b>inspections.</b>|$|E

40|$|Little {{empirical}} {{research has been}} done on monitoring and enforcement issues in environmental economics, especially to analyze the impact of monitoring and enforcement on polluters'environmental performance. No studies have been done in developing economies. The authors explore the impact of inspections, and the potential impact of pollution charges and citizen's complaints, on the environmental performance of polluters in China. Their analysis of plant-level data from the city of Zhenjiang shows that: 1) Inspections have a statistically significant impact on firm's environmental performance. 2) Pollution charges do not have a statistically significant effect on firms'performance - although the lack of variation in pollution charges in Zhenjiang precludes effectively capturing their impact. 3) Complaints {{have a significant impact on}} inspections and therefore on pollution control.

An autonomous inspection robot should actively examine entities of interest (EOIs), e. g. defects, and should perform <b>additional</b> <b>inspection</b> actions until {{the data analysis}} results reach an appropriate level of confidence. In this paper a semantic approach for inspection planning, plan execution, assessment of the data analysis results, decision making and replanning is proposed. The main idea is to incorporate human expert knowledge via a semantic inspection model. For the experimental evaluation of this approach the detection and classification of waste on irregular terrains with the hexapod walking machine LAURON is chosen.

CAU 92 was closed {{in accordance with the}} Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Part B Operational Permit (Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP), 1995) and the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order of 1996. Closure activities were completed on February 16, 1999, and the Closure Report (U. S. Department of Energy, Nevada Operations Office, 1999) was approved and a Notice of Completion issued by the NDEP on May 11, 1999. CAU 92 consists of two Corrective Action Sites (CASs) : CAS 06 - 04 - 01, Decon Pad Oil/Water Separator; and CAS 06 - 05 - 02, Decontamination Pond (RCRA). Both CASs have use restrictions; however, only CAS 06 - 05 - 02 requires post-closure inspections. Visual inspections of the cover and fencing at CAS 06 - 05 - 02 are performed quarterly. <b>Additional</b> <b>inspections</b> are conducted if precipitation occurs in excess of 1. 28 centimeters (cm) (0. 50 inches [in]) in a 24 -hour period.
