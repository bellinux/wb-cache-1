5|$|At {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the {{remnants}} of brick walls could indicate the presence of a mortuary temple, but the archaeological traces are so tenuous that <b>any</b> <b>closer</b> examination and more precise reconstruction is impossible today. The same goes for the ruins of a building several hundred metres away from the pyramid, and which might have been the valley temple. If this was indeed a valley temple, its east-west orientation would be unique in all pyramid complexes.|$|E
5|$|Brooklyn went hitless in {{the bottom}} of the eighth. They {{inserted}} Harry Taylor to pitch the top half of the ninth, in which, he held St. Louis hitless. With half an inning left to play, the Dodgers began to get hits off of Dickson. Galan doubled, and after Walker flied out, Ed Stevens tripled to score Galan and Furillo singled to score Stevens, after a wild pitch and a walk, Brecheen took over pitching duties for Dickson with St. Louis leading 8–3. Edwards singled off Brecheen and allowed Furillo to score, and after Cookie Lavagetto walked, the score was 8–4 with the bases loaded. The Cardinals kept the score from getting <b>any</b> <b>closer,</b> as Brecheen struck out the final two batters to end the game.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo {{took over}} {{at their own}} 19-yard line and {{promptly}} earned their 1stfirstdown of the game on a 10-yardpass from quarterback Drew Willy to wide receiver Naaman Roosevelt. The Bulls' drive stalled from there, forcing them to punt. The punt struck the ground and hit UConn's Jonathan Jean-Louis, who was attempting to block for the punt return; Buffalo recovered the loose ball, giving them back possession at the Connecticut 23-yard line. The Bulls were unable to move the ball <b>any</b> <b>closer</b> to the end zone, and settled for a 38-yard field goal by kicker A. J. Principe, giving them a 3–0 lead with 4:26 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E

5|$|The 256,300 man strong U.S. First Army, {{commanded}} by General Courtney Hodges, {{was ordered to}} break through the Siegfried Line around the area of Aachen, in order to reach the Rur river. Although the First Army began to encircle the area around Aachen in early September, the Battle of Aachen did not end until 21 October. The city cost the Americans roughly 3,000 casualties, but had opened the path to the Rur (river) river. Despite the casualties taken the ground gained was comparatively worthless, and the fighting for Aachen had not necessarily brought German defeat <b>any</b> <b>closer.</b>|$|E
5|$|When De Simone's mother, Mary Sedotti, {{discovered}} {{she had not}} returned home by the morning, she expressed concern, and her husband Michael, Teresa's stepfather, drove to the pub where he observed DeSimone's car still parked, but did not make <b>any</b> <b>closer</b> investigation. Shortly after 10:00, Anthony Pocock, the landlord of the Tom Tackle, was expecting a commercial delivery to the premises, and believing DeSimone had deliberately left the car overnight he {{decided to try to}} move it to allow the delivery through. Inside he discovered DeSimone's partially clothed body on the back seat. He immediately called the police.|$|E
5|$|Michigan scored {{first when}} Cameron Gordon {{picked up a}} Purdue fumble and ran it back 58 yards for a touchdown, their first {{defensive}} points of the season. They added to their lead {{a few minutes later}} with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Roy Roundtree. Purdue scored their first points late in the first quarter with a 20-yard field goal by Carson Wiggs, and then added more points in the second quarter when Ricardo Allen intercepted a Denard Robinson pass and ran it back 94 yards for a touchdown. They then came within a point of a tie a few minutes later by kicking a 46-yard field goal, but would not come <b>any</b> <b>closer.</b> Early in the third quarter, Michigan's Vincent Smith ran in a 19-yard touchdown, but the extra point failed. Purdue's only score of the second half was a 40-yard field goal that came in the third quarter. Michigan sealed their win late in the fourth quarter with a 3-yard touchdown run by Stephen Hopkins.|$|E

5|$|Rousseau {{had also}} been badly wounded in the exchange, and command of Junon passed to Lieutenant Jean-Léon Emeric, who {{attempted}} {{to pull away from}} his battered adversary. As he did so the small brig Driver was well placed to intervene, but her captain, Charles Claridge, failed to engage the larger frigate, even though Latona was now rapidly approaching from the west and together they could have outnumbered and outmanoeuvred Junon. Superieure was also close by, and her captain, William Ferrie, did approach the larger French ship, his fire causing enough damage to Junons sails to prevent her escape. Taking Horatio in tow at 14:24, the brig kept Scott's frigate in the chase until sufficient repairs were complete. By 14:40 Horatio was again sailing independently and Driver finally came close enough to open fire, although at extreme range: Claridge refused to sail <b>any</b> <b>closer</b> to Junon, despite urgent signals from Horatio and Superieure. At 15:04, Superieure was again close enough to the French ship to open fire and at 15:25 Latona arrived, her presence finally convincing Claridge to enter the action. Surrounded by enemy ships and his sails in tatters, Emeric made one last effort to escape to the north, the strain of this manoeuvre causing his main and mizen masts to collapse. With both flight and resistance impossible, Junon surrendered at 15:40.|$|E
5|$|After {{a two-day}} rest, the Lady Vols resumed their season with {{three games in}} five days, {{starting}} with their final non-conference opponent, Memphis, on the road. UT started strong, taking a 16–6 lead {{to open up the}} game, only to give it back up. Memphis delighted its home crowd by taking a 38–31 lead with two minutes to go in the half, but Tennessee rallied and took a two-point lead to the locker room. Once again, Tennessee pulled away in the second half, 91–65, behind three players who scored over twenty: Holdsclaw (31), Randall (21), and Catchings (20). The next game was against Auburn, a program that is traditionally competitive within the conference. Once again, Summitt's team started the game strong, leading 32–16 before Auburn woke up, cutting the lead to five by the half. However, the Tigers would not get <b>any</b> <b>closer</b> than this, as Holdsclaw's 39 points helped Tennessee to yet another win, 79–63. The final game of this stretch was the rematch with Vanderbilt, played on President's Day in front of a sellout crowd at the Commodores' quirky Memorial Gymnasium and a national television audience on ESPN. The Commodores started off strong, taking a 16–7 lead in front of their home crowd. However Tennessee responded with seventeen straight points to take the lead, and led by nine at the halftime. As in previous games, the Lady Vols made a big run to open up the second half to put the game out of reach. UT won 91–60, with UT shooting over fifty percent yet again. The final game of the regular season came against LSU, a respectable SEC team which beat the Lady Vols the previous season in Baton Rouge, but still a few seasons away from becoming a national power. Tennessee played well on Senior Night, starting with a 32–8 lead that would never be given up. Tennessee completed the season with a 90–58 win, giving them a perfect 30–0 regular season.|$|E

25|$|In 1658, three Dutch Republic ships, also {{partially}} {{searching for}} the Vergulde Draeck visited the area. The Waekende Boey under Captain S. Volckertszoon, the Elburg under Captain J. Peereboom and the Emeloort under Captain A. Joncke sighted Rottnest but did not proceed <b>any</b> <b>closer</b> to the mainland because of the many reefs. They then travelled north and subsequently found {{the wreck of the}} Vergulde Draeck (but still no survivors). They gave an unfavourable opinion of the area partly due to the dangerous reefs.|$|E
25|$|After ridding {{himself of}} the Cartel's {{influence}} in the area, Gus fires Walt and warns him that if Hank gets <b>any</b> <b>closer,</b> he will have Walt's family killed. Walt tries {{to use one of}} Saul's connections to get him and his family relocated, but finds most of his drug money has been used by Skyler to pay off Ted's IRS fines to avoid having their own lives investigated. After arranging for his family's safety under the DEA, Walt resolves to kill Gus, but finds that the kingpin is far too protected. Walt begs for Jesse's help, but Jesse refuses.|$|E

In 1352 Turkish forces invaded Bulgaria anew, raiding Thrace, particularly the vicinities of Aitos, Yambol, and Plovdiv, and capturing rich spoils. In the same year the Ottomans seized their first fortress on the Balkans, Tsimpe on the Gallipoli peninsula, setting firm foot in Europe. Until 1354 Ottoman forces again ravaged the lands around Yambol and Plovdiv as well as the lower valleys of the Maritsa and Tundzha rivers.|$|E

25|$|Behind a solid {{effort from}} running back Jermelle Lewis and wide {{receiver}} C.J. Jones, the Hawkeyes quickly jumped out to a 100 lead. And {{if it were not}} for a fumble punt, the game wouldn't have gotten <b>any</b> <b>closer.</b> As it is, Michigan's Chris Perry scored moments later and Iowa took a 106 lead into halftime. After a Michigan field goal pushed the score to 109, Iowa took over. The Hawkeyes scored 24 unanswered points to finish the game as Lewis and Jones racked up two touchdowns each. Quarterback Brad Banks threw for 222 yards and three touchdowns as Iowa handed Michigan their worst home loss since 1967.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half, Georgia's offense began moving the ball, scoring {{on their first}} drive of the half when Blair Walsh kicked a 33-yard field goal. On Alabama's sixth drive of the game, Georgia defense forced a three-and-out for the first time, forcing a P.J. Fitzgerald punt. Georgia again cut into the lead later {{in the third quarter}} when running back Knowshon Moreno ran for a two-yard touchdown, to cap a 58-yard drive and cut Alabama's lead to 31–10. Georgia made it a game again when Prince Miller {{returned}} a Fitzgerald punt for a 92-yard touchdown making the score 31-17. They wouldn't get <b>any</b> <b>closer.</b> On the following drive, Alabama extended their lead to 34–17 on a 32-yard Leigh Tiffin field goal.|$|E
25|$|By about 8:45a.m., {{almost three}} hours after the initial start time for the attack, Delamain still had no word that Houghton was <b>any</b> <b>closer</b> to {{clearing}} the marshes.

The Maharattas lost all of their British officers, leaving the battalion under the command of its Viceroy's Commissioned Officers. As the Maharattas and sappers attacked the northern end of the line, 2nd Dorsets struck at the center and southern end of the line, encountering stiff resistance.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Navy ship HMS Plantagenet of seventy-four guns, {{commanded}} by Captain Robert Loyd, was sailing to the West Indies with the thirty-eight gun frigate HMS Rota and the eighteen gun brig-sloop HMS Carnation for the Louisiana Campaign. On {{the night of}} September 26, the three were in company and cruising in Fayal Roads when they spotted the Baltimore Clipper General Armstrong, a brig of seven guns with a complement of about ninety men. She was {{commanded by}} Captain Samuel Chester Reid who {{was not prepared to}} surrender his ship. Captain Loyd ordered that a pinnace under Lieutenant Robert Faussett be sent from the Plantagenet to ascertain the nationality of the stranger in port. When the British came within gun range of the American vessel and requested that its crew identify themselves, Captain Reid declared that he would fire if the British came <b>any</b> <b>closer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{associated}} problem mission managers faced was if one rib popped free, {{there would}} be increased pressure on the remaining two, and {{if one of them}} popped out the last would be under so much pressure it would never release. The second part of the problem was due to Galileo revised flight plan. The probe had never been intended to approach the Sun <b>any</b> <b>closer</b> than the orbit of Earth, but sending it to Venus would expose it to temperatures at least 50 degrees higher than at Earth distance. So the probe had to be protected from that extra heat, part of which involved adapting some of the computer functions. Forty-one device drivers had been programmed into the computer, but with no room for any more, the mission planners had to decide which driver they could use in association with the heat protection. They chose the antenna motor reverse driver.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{inspired}} by observing white children {{pretending to be}} ghosts to scare black children, Ben fights back by forming the Ku Klux Klan. As a result, Elsie, out of loyalty to her father, breaks off her relationship with Ben. Later, Flora Cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by Gus, a freedman and soldier {{who is now a}} captain. He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes <b>any</b> <b>closer.</b> When he does, she leaps to her death. Having run through the forest looking for her, Ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the Cameron home. In response, the Klan hunts down Gus, tries him, finds him guilty, and lynches him.|$|E
