Sparrow, {{reviewing}} the graphic novel King of Fighters 2003: Volume 4 for IGN, commented that K' is [...] "sufficiently heroic" [...] with the comic allowing the exploration of his motivations. His duel against Kyo's clone, Kusanagi, was referred by GenjisPress as [...] "fan-only territory" [...] {{due to the lack}} of context. His relationship with his partner Maxima is described as: [...] "hard to tell friend from rival in <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> especially for one who is unfamiliar with the game." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Pine Bluff Variant" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban. For much of the show's fifth season, Shiban had an index card that simply read [...] "Mulder Undercover". He had long wanted to do <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> noting, [...] "It always seemed to fit to me—putting Mulder in a {{situation}} [...] don't know his allegiance."

60|$|From {{the palace}} to the gloomy prison {{is but a}} step--one might almost jump across the narrow canal that intervenes. The {{ponderous}} stone Bridge of Sighs crosses it at the second story--a bridge that is a covered tunnel --you {{can not be seen}} when you walk in it. It is partitioned lengthwise, and through one compartment walked such as bore light sentences in ancient times, and through the other marched sadly the wretches whom the Three had doomed to lingering misery and utter oblivion in the dungeons, or to sudden and mysterious death. Down below the level of the water, by the light of smoking torches, we were shown the damp, thick-walled cells where many a proud patrician's life was eaten away by the long-drawn miseries of solitary imprisonment--without light, air, books; naked, unshaven, uncombed, covered with vermin; his useless tongue forgetting its office, with none to speak to; the days and nights of his life no longer marked, but merged into one eternal eventless night; far away from all cheerful sounds, buried in the silence of a tomb; forgotten by his helpless friends, and his fate a dark mystery to them forever; losing his own memory at last, and knowing no more who he was or how he came there; devouring the loaf of bread and drinking the water that were thrust into the cell by unseen hands, and troubling his worn spirit no more with hopes and fears and doubts and longings to be free; ceasing to scratch vain prayers and complainings on walls where none, not even himself, could see them, and resigning himself to hopeless apathy, driveling childishness, lunacy! Many and many <b>a</b> sorrowful <b>story</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> these stony walls could tell if they could but speak.|$|R

And who knows what now stands in the place of these pensioners’ loss – faux Italianate villas? <b>an</b> IKEA? pavement? <b>Stories</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> make <b>a</b> timely book of journalist Jasper Becker’s history of the Chinese capital, City of Heavenly Tranquility: Beijing in the History of China from Oxford University Press (and from a division of Penguin in the U. K.) – not the news of the razing of much of old Beijing, which largely began in the 1950 s, but its near completion by a “new” China stepping ceremoniously onto the world stage. Becker’s premise of the near total destruction of Beijing’s charm – and the rise of phony Ming-throwback facades for tourists – is impossible to dispute. His book bounces back and forth from episodes in Yuan or Ming Beijing to a real estate agent called Sunshine showcasing a $ 400, 000 penthouse in the Middle Sea Purple Gold Garden, a forestry professor eager to talk about stock options, and “The casual ugliness of so much of the Yuanming Yuan… the tacky funfair, a dreary zoo, a so-called ‘primitive people’s totem park’ and amusement rides featuring Snow White. ” (84) But just as media coverage leading up to the recent Olympics suggested China was the inventor of smog, Becker would have it that the Chinese also founded kitsch...|$|R

[...] "You have to understand that it can affect anybody, you know? It's not just the girls in Fusion who you only see once a week. It's people who are pivotal to the environment, as well. I'm trying to say this in a way that doesn't undercut what the Fusion girls have meant to the canvas, particularly those three characters who've been attacked , but a character with as much history as Dixie.... It shows that nothing is sacred and nothing is safe. By jumping off that diving board, not knowing what's at the bottom of the pool, you've now taken the story to a whole new level." ...|$|E

[...] Calling RT [...] "mass information manipulation" [...] Firth said [...] "they have a very clear idea in their mind of what they’re trying to prove."

60|$|Now, fellow-citizens, {{in regard}} to this matter about a {{contract}} that was made between Judge Trumbull and myself, and all that long portion of Judge Douglas's speech on this subject,--I wish simply to say what I have said to him before, that he cannot know whether it is true or not, and I do {{know that there is}} not a word of truth in it. And I have told him so before. I don't want any harsh language indulged in, but I do not know how to deal with this persistent insisting on <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that I know to be utterly without truth. It used to be a fashion amongst men that when a charge was made, some sort of proof was brought forward to establish it, and if no proof was found to exist, the charge was dropped. I don't know how to meet this kind of an argument. I don't want to have a fight with Judge Douglas, and I have no way of making an argument up into the consistency of a corn-cob and stopping his mouth with it. All I can do is--good-humoredly--to say that, from the beginning to the end of all that <b>story</b> about <b>a</b> bargain between Judge Trumbull and myself, there is not a word of truth in it. I can only ask him to show some sort of evidence of the truth of his story. He brings forward here and reads from what he contends is a speech by James H. Matheny, charging such a bargain between Trumbull and myself. My own opinion is that Matheny did do some such immoral thing as to tell <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that he knew nothing about. I believe he did. I contradicted it instantly, and it has been contradicted by Judge Trumbull, while nobody has produced any proof, because there is none. Now, whether the speech which the Judge brings forward here is really the one Matheny made, I do not know, and I hope the Judge will pardon me for doubting the genuineness of this document, since his production of those Springfield resolutions at Ottawa. I do not wish to dwell at any great length upon this matter. I can say nothing when <b>a</b> long <b>story</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> is told, except it is not true, and demand that he who insists upon it shall produce some proof. That is all any man can do, and I leave it in that way, for I know of no other way of dealing with it.|$|R
