5|$|Fixed-speed loads {{subject the}} motor {{to a high}} {{starting}} torque and to current surges that <b>are</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> eight times the full-load current. AC drives instead gradually ramp the motor up to operating speed to lessen mechanical and electrical stress, reducing maintenance and repair costs, and extending {{the life of the}} motor and the driven equipment.|$|E

5|$|It {{is still}} not certain how many people died on the inner German border or who they all were, as the GDR treated such {{information}} as a closely guarded secret. But estimates have risen steadily since unification, as evidence has been gathered from East German records. As of 2009, unofficial estimates <b>are</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1,100people, though officially released figures give a count from 270 up to 421 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Little Ring Mountain at the {{northern}} end of the field contains at least 70% brown volcanic glass with isolated phenocrysts of plagioclase. Vesicular textures <b>are</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5%, suggesting that the lava erupted subaerially. Probable xenocrysts of quartz have been identified at the volcano. At least one xenolith fragment has been found in loose rubble at the volcano and included several quartz xenocrysts and polycrystalline quartz xenoliths in a glassy matrix with trachytic plagioclase.|$|E
5|$|Mount Osmond {{contains}} {{a number of}} historical attractions; notably in the former mines and mining infrastructure that remains on the hillside {{as a reminder of}} its past. The mines continue up throughout the hills from Glen Osmond. While Wheal Gawler and Wheal Watkins are former open-cut mines (located in Glen Osmond), Mount Osmond contains more mineshafts which <b>are</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> sixty metres deep.|$|E

5|$|Since the 2000s, the New York City Subway has {{undergone}} its biggest expansion program {{since the late}} 1960s, with five stations opened since 2009. There <b>are</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 15 more subway stations definitively planned. Still, the 21st-century expansion plan {{pales in comparison to}} some of the subway system's other previous plans, {{as well as to the}} ambitious expansion of the subway in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Some organisms, {{such as the}} lichen Trapelia involuta or {{microorganisms}} such as {{the bacterium}} Citrobacter, can absorb concentrations of uranium that <b>are</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 300 times {{the level of their}} environment. Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.|$|E

5|$|The Red Canyon Conglomerate, the basal {{member of}} the Moenkopi, fills broad east-flowing paleo{{channels}} carved into the Kaibab Limestone. Some of these channels <b>are</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> several tens of feet deep and may reach 200ft (61m) deep in the St. George area. A thin, poorly developed soil, or regolith, formed over the paleotopographic high areas between the channels.|$|E
5|$|The genome of {{rotavirus}} {{consists of}} 11 unique double helix molecules of RNA which are 18,555 nucleotides in total. Each helix, or segment, is a gene, numbered 1 to 11 by decreasing size.

Desserts include a chocolate and pecan brownie with crème Chantilly.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is an olive-brown colour. The oval to {{spindle-shaped}} spores have dimensions of 8–10 by 3.5–4.5μm. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to narrowly club-shaped, measuring 22.4–33.4 by 5.8–8.0μm. They bear four sterigmata (each holding a single spore), which <b>are</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 6.8μm long. Cystidia are present {{on both the}} tube ends (cheilocystidia) and tube faces (pleurocystidia). There are no clamp connections in the hyphae of Suillus bovinus. The cap cuticle comprises filamentous, gelatinized hyphae with a diameter of 2.6–5.0μm. The mycelium has a pink tinge.|$|E
5|$|The spores of Bovista pila are spherical, smooth (when {{viewed with}} a light microscope), and measure 3.5–4.5μm. They have thick walls and very short pedicels. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, {{measuring}} 8–10.5 by 14–18μm. They are usually four-spored (rarely, some are three-spored), with unequal length sterigmata between 4 and 7.4μm.

5|$|A {{ski flying}} event {{consists}} of several preliminary stages, {{culminating in a}} competition to decide a winner and subsequent order. Within an event there <b>are</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> three competitions – individual, and sometimes team – all taking place on separate days. These competitions are contested somewhat differently depending on whether an event is staged {{as part of the}} Ski Flying World Championships or Ski Flying World Cup. In both events, a 'training' round takes place on the opening day, as well as a 'trial' round before each competition; these non-scoring rounds are essentially practice or warm-up sessions, and athlete participation is optional.|$|E
