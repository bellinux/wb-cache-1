5000|$|According to {{constitutional}} expert A G Noorani, all {{the legal}} arguments against the article are groundless, and are raised with [...] "communal-minded majoritarian" [...] intentions. He {{refers to the}} various Articles in the Constitution, that similarly provide special rights to other Indian states like Nagaland (Article 371A) and Mizoram (Article 371G) and notes that there are various provisions in the Indian Constitution which confer [...] "special status" [...] to several other states also, in varying degrees based on historical reasons, and remarks that no objections were raised on them. Since Article 370 was enacted on 26 November 1949 {{as part of the}} Constitution of India by the Constituent Assembly of India which was a sovereign body, he remarks, Article 35A [...] "flows inexorably" [...] from it. He recalls the Sheikh Abdullah's report to Kashmir’s Constituent Assembly on 11 August 1952, which said, “it was agreed that the State legislature shall have power to define and regulate the rights and privileges of the permanent residents of the State more especially in regard to <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property,</b> appointments to services and like matters. There are historic reasons which necessitate such constitutional safeguards as for centuries past, the people of the State have been victims of exploitation at the hands of their well-to-do neighbours." ...|$|E
50|$|In his {{statement}} to the Lok Sabha on the Delhi agreement, Nehru has said:The question of citizenship arose obviously. Full citizenship applies there. But our friends from Kashmir were very apprehensive about one or two matters. For a long time past, in the Maharaja's time, there had been laws there preventing any outsider, that is, any person from outside Kashmir, from acquiring or holding land in Kashmir. If I mention it, {{in the old days}} the Maharaja was very much afraid {{of a large number of}} Englishmen coming and settling down there, because the climate is delectable, and acquiring property. So although most of their rights were taken away from the Maharaja under the British rule, the Maharaja stuck to this that nobody from outside should acquire land there. And that continues. So the present Government of Kashmir is very anxious to preserve that right because they are afraid, and I think rightly afraid, that Kashmir would be overrun by people whose sole qualification might be the possession of too much money and nothing else, who might buy up, and get the delectable places. Now they want to vary the old Maharaja’s laws to liberalise it, but nevertheless to have checks on the acquisition of lands by persons from outside. However, we agree that this should be cleared up. The old state’s subjects definition gave certain privileges regarding this acquisition of land, the services, and other minor things, I think, State scholarships and the rest. So, we agreed and noted this down: 'The State legislature shall have power to define and regulate the rights and privileges of the permanent residents of the State, more especially in regard to the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property,</b> appointments to services and like matters. Till then the existing State law should apply.'Following the adoption of the provisions of the Delhi Agreement by the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, the President of India issued The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954, through which Indian citizenship was extended to the residents of the state, and simultaneously the Article 35A was inserted into the Indian constitution enabling the State legislature to define the privileges of the permanent residents.|$|E

Primary {{aim of this}} study is how to protect private land owners rights in spite of governments power of acquiring land. Bangladesh, as for details study, is a most densely populated country in the World. International best standards of practicing guidelines by FAO-UN, FIG and WB as well as other countries practice have reviewed from different perspectives. From theory, early stage negotiations, market value of property plus other damages, opportunity of involvement of all parties, protection of agricultural land, removal services all of those are the thorny of legal challenges to adopt into a new legislation in Bangladesh. Empirically, field study has conducted by way of interviewing from selected different projects in Bangladesh including largest project Padma Multiple Bridge. Huge destitute of land, unplanned city expansion, unsustainable development of infrastructure and environmental damage are remained as significant issues of sustainable development of land management. Analysis shows that Bangladesh has been losing 1 % of agriculture land which related to the national employment and food production. 100 % of the affected people wants to resettlement by the authority. There is clearly misusing of legal rights by the government authority: firstly, by using inequitable <b>Acquisition</b> and Requisition <b>of</b> <b>Immovable</b> <b>Property</b> Ordinance, 1982; no protection has been giving for religious place and graveyard under Antiquities Act, and Article 42 (2) of Constitution also imposing unfair curtailment of rights for getting fair compensation.

This area is defined by its residents as âland of heritageâ. The research, which was carried out between the years 2005 and 2013, focused on the process of value apprehension of these residents and their worldview, which are responsible for guiding them in their relationship with the land through the standards established by the very community.

40|$|It is an {{accepted}} principle in South African law that movable property acquired in an original way (by operation of law) is not burdened by any limited real rights, as previous limited real rights are extinguished on the vesting of ownership (mobilia non habent sequelam). It is assumed by some South African writers {{that the same}} principles are applicable to the original <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> and that all existing limited real rights fall away on original acquisition of ownership. In this article the nature of limited real rights to immovable property is examined, {{and the notion that}} ownership is the "mother" right on which all limited real rights are based is scrutinised critically. The nature and establishment of limited real rights are used to distinguish between the essence and effect of limited real rights in the case of immovable property. The recognition of limited real rights as constitutional property is used as a further argument that limited real rights cannot be extinguished automatically by the original <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property,</b> as such common law or statutory measures will constitute an arbitrary deprivation of property in terms of section 25 of the Constitution. The statutory provisions regarding limited real rights in the case of prescription and expropriation are then analysed as an indication {{that it is not a}} general principle that limited real rights are extinguished automatically on the original acquisition of ownership of immovable property...|$|E
