2500|$|The Indians {{were thus}} {{left with a}} target of 230, and there were still ten overs left in the day, but the Indian openers survived all of these overs without any scare. Virender Sehwag played aggressively, thumping a couple of {{boundaries}} off the fast bowlers, while he also hit Stuart MacGill's first ball for four to midwicket. Chopra also played patiently and {{showed no sign of}} nerves, cover driving Bracken and Gillespie with some good timing.

50|$|The concerto exudes a {{particularly}} boisterous, even blustering atmosphere. The movements {{one to three}} feature similar themes, {{the first and third}} begin similarly, all three captivate largely by their rhythm. The second begins with lightning glissandi, introducing a dancing theme, later contrasted by more spreading motions. It ends in curiosity.The fourth movement comes as a bit of a surprise <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> to be a fairly closed work. It is the longest and accordingly the slowest of all and has a climax of heroic grandeur. The Vivo opens poignantly, then goes over into a quieter mood, making use of the unconventional Locrian mode. The concerto ends at a blazing volume.|$|R

Gradually collecting my thoughts, I find my perplexity considerably increased by a trifling but curious circumstance. The curtains which I had forbidden Peter to touch are drawn--closely drawn, so as to plunge the whole room in obscurity. And, more surprising still, a high screen with folding sides stands before the fire, and confines the light which it might otherwise give exclusively to the ceiling. I am literally enveloped in shadows. Has night come? ...|$|R
6000|$|A coup {{has been}} {{reserved}} {{for us at}} the railway station. The attentive porter, on the look-out for his fee pulls down the blinds over the side windows of the carriage, and shuts out all prying eyes in that way. <b>After</b> <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> to be an interminable delay the train starts. My husband winds his arm round me. [...] "At last!" [...] he whispers, with love in his eyes that no words can utter, and presses me to him gently. My arm steals round his neck; my eyes answer his eyes. Our lips meet in the first long, lingering kiss of our married life.|$|R

In this paper we try to relate the westward pressure of Arimaspi and Issedonians, regarded as the origin of the Cimmerian-Scythian migrations, to the downfall of the Chinese Western Zhou dynasty, some hundred years before, after the storm of the Xianyun invasions. We dare to explain both events as resulting from a common background, the rise of nomadic horsemanship in the Asiatic steppe...|$|R

5000|$|The other {{use is a}} kind {{of tourism}} where the {{personality}} can be transferred into some other brain to absorb some experience, followed by re-playing that into the original brain.

5000|$|Kōsaku {{childhood}} best friend. She {{has a major}} {{crush on}} Kōsaku, and her over-protectiveness shot up with Ringo's arrival. She even challenged her in episode 3 {{to a series of}} contests because of that. Though <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> to be their [...] "fight" [...] on the rice fields in an episode (she called Ringo a [...] "Thieving Cat" [...] during that time), they seemed to be friendly with each other. She speaks with a Mino dialect. She is revealed to be very ticklish in episode 4. She mentioned that Kosaku often stayed with her (as he had no mother and his father was always out) and took baths with her and her siblings until their eighth grade, much to Rintarō's envy.|$|R
