5|$|Like other rare-earth metals, {{lutetium}} {{is regarded}} as having <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>degree</b> of toxicity, but its compounds should be handled with care nonetheless: for example, lutetium fluoride inhalation is dangerous and the compound irritates skin. Lutetium nitrate may be dangerous as it may explode and burn once heated. Lutetium oxide powder is toxic as well if inhaled or ingested.|$|E
5|$|For example, in most {{underdeveloped}} economies, {{the technology}} {{used to carry}} out agricultural activities is backward. There is <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>degree</b> of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while {{a large proportion of}} the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%. This points to the need to increase output per unit input and output per head. This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country.|$|E

25|$|Increased {{pressure}} {{tends to}} decrease polymerization rates reducing uniformity of deposition since uniformity {{is controlled by}} constant pressure. This is a reason that high-pressure plasma or atmospheric-pressure plasmas are not usually used in favor of low-pressure systems.At pressures greater than 1 torr, oligomers are formed on the electrode surface, and the monomers also on the surface can dissolve them to get <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>degree</b> of polymerization forming an oily substance. At low pressures, the reactive surfaces are low in monomer and facilitate growing high molecular weight polymers.|$|E

25|$|HDPE {{is defined}} by a density of greater or equal to 0.941nbsp&g/cm3. HDPE has <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>degree</b> of branching. The mostly linear {{molecules}} pack together well, so intermolecular forces are stronger than in highly branched polymers. HDPE can be produced by chromium/silica catalysts, Ziegler-Natta catalysts or metallocene catalysts; by choosing catalysts and reaction conditions, {{the small amount of}} branching that does occur can be controlled. These catalysts prefer the formation of free radicals at the ends of the growing polyethylene molecules. They cause new ethylene monomers to add {{to the ends of the}} molecules, rather than along the middle, causing the growth of a linear chain.|$|E
25|$|Sewage and fecal sludge management: In cholera-affected areas, {{sewage and}} fecal sludge {{need to be}} treated and managed {{carefully}} {{in order to stop}} the spread of this disease via human excreta. Provision of sanitation and hygiene is an important preventative measure. Open defecation, release of untreated sewage, or dumping of fecal sludge from pit latrines or septic tanks into the environment need to be prevented. In many cholera affected zones, there is <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>degree</b> of sewage treatment. Therefore, the implementation of dry toilets that do not contribute to water pollution, as they do not flush with water, may be an interesting alternative to flush toilets.|$|E
25|$|It is {{apparent}} {{from the above}} process that the matrix stiffness method is easier to comprehend and to implement for automatic computation. It is also easier to extend for advanced applications such as non-linear analysis, stability, vibrations, etc. For these reasons, the matrix stiffness method is the method of choice for use in general purpose structural analysis software packages. On the other hand, for linear systems with <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>degree</b> of statical indeterminacy, the flexibility method {{has the advantage of}} being computationally less intensive. This advantage, however, is a moot point as personal computers are widely available and more powerful. The main redeeming factor in learning this method nowadays is its educational value in imparting the concepts of equilibrium and compatibility in addition to its historical value. In contrast, the procedure of the direct stiffness method is so mechanical that it risks being used without much understanding of the structural behaviors.|$|E

500|$|Although a city, Sheffield is informally {{known as}} [...] "the largest village in England", {{because of a}} {{combination}} of topographical isolation and demographic stability. It is relatively geographically isolated, being cut off from other places by a ring of hills. (Local folklore insists that, like Rome, Sheffield was built [...] "on seven hills".) The land surrounding Sheffield was unsuitable for industrial use, and now includes several protected green belt areas. These topographical factors have served to restrict urban spread, resulting in a relatively stable population size and <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>degree</b> of mobility.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the large}} ionic radius and great electropositivity of La3+, {{there is not much}} {{covalent}} contribution to its bonding and hence it has a limited coordination chemistry, like yttrium and the other lanthanides. Lanthanum oxalate does not dissolve very much in alkali-metal oxalate solutions, and [...] decomposes around 500°C. Oxygen is the most common donor atom in lanthanum complexes, which are mostly ionic and often have high coordination numbers over 6: 8 is the most characteristic, forming square antiprismatic and dodecadeltahedral structures. These high-coordinate species, reaching up to coordination number 12 with the use of chelating ligands such as in La2(SO4)3·9H2O, often have <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>degree</b> of symmetry because of stereo-chemical factors.|$|E

[...] They live on the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range located in the Pryor Mountains of Montana and Wyoming in the United States, and are the only Mustang herd remaining in Montana. They are protected by the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 (WFRHBA) and managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), who has set the optimum herd number at 120 animals. Genetic studies have revealed that the herd exhibits a high degree of genetic diversity and <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>degree</b> of inbreeding, and BLM has acknowledged the genetic uniqueness of the herd. Pryor Mountain Mustangs are relatively small horses, exhibit a natural ambling gait, and domesticated Pryor Mountain Mustangs are known for their strength, sure-footedness and stamina.|$|E

Services can be classified according to a service process matrix: degree of labor intensity (volume) vs degree of customization (variety). With a high degree of labor intensity there are Mass Services (e.g., commercial banking bill payments and state schools) and Professional Services (e.g., personal physicians and lawyers), while with <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>degree</b> of labor intensity there are Service Factories (e.g., airlines and hotels) and Service Shops (e.g., hospitals and auto mechanics).|$|E
2500|$|Overall, axon {{elongation}} is {{the product}} of a process known as tip growth. [...] In this process, new material is added at the growth cone while the remainder of the axonal cytoskeleton remains stationary. [...] This occurs via two processes: cytoskeletal-based dynamics and mechanical tension. [...] With cytoskeletal dynamics, microtubules polymerize into the growth cone and deliver vital components. [...] Mechanical tension occurs when the membrane is stretched due to force generation by molecular motors in the growth cone and strong adhesions to the substrate along the axon. [...] In general, rapidly growing growth cones are small and have a large degree of stretching, while slow moving or paused growth cones are very large and have <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>degree</b> of stretching.|$|E
2500|$|Reasons {{for getting}} {{involved}} in swinging are the variety of sexual partners and experiences, pleasure or excitement, meeting new people and voyeurism (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009). In order for swinging to work, both partners {{need to have a}} liberal sexual predisposition, and <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>degree</b> of jealously. Interestingly enough, extramarital sex, with both partners being aware and consenting, can have positive effects on the relationship (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009). Gilmartin (1975) found that 85 percent of his sample of swingers felt that these sexual encounters posed no real threat to their marriage and felt it had improved. [...] Jenks (1998) found {{no reason to believe that}} swinging was detrimental to marriage, with over 91% of males and 82% of females indicating they were happy with swinging (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009). [...] However it is important to note that although there is no current research to point that this type of extramarital sex does not affect the majority of marriages in a negative way, there is no doubt that there are marriages that are negatively affected (Jenks, 1998).|$|E
