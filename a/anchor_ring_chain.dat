40|$|Using {{primarily}} numerical methods {{we study}} clustering processes and collective excitations in a one-dimensional <b>ring</b> <b>chain.</b> The <b>ring</b> <b>chain</b> is constituted by N identical point particles with next neighbors interacting via nonlinear Morse springs. If {{the system is}} coupled to a heat bath (Gaussian white noise and viscous friction), then depending on the particle density and the bath temperature different phase-like states can be distinguished. This will be illustrated by means of numerically calculated phase diagrams. In order to identify collective excitations activated by the heat bath we calculate the spectrum of the normalized dynamical structure factor (SDF). Our numerical {{results show that the}} transition regions between different phase-like states are typically characterized by a 1 /f-type SDF spectrum, reflecting the fact that near critical points correlations on all length and time scales become important. In {{the last part of the}} paper we also discuss a non-equilibrium effect, which occurs if an additional nonlinearly velocity-dependent force is included in the equations of motions. In particular it will be shown that such additional dissipative effects may stabilize cluster configurations. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin/Heidelberg 2003...|$|R

40|$|The {{response}} of a premixed laminar conical flame to a periodic perturbation {{of the flow}} was analyzed. The idea was used to imitate the acoustic flow excitation by an oscillation of the flame <b>anchoring</b> <b>ring.</b> In this case the flow field is free from the ring vortices and other coherent structure formation typical for the harmonically excited jet pattern. Under this simplified perturbation condition the flame cone kinematics is studied and compared with the flame response to acoustic flow excitation. The heat release rate response Transfer Function (TF) for a foot-perturbed flame is measured and found {{to be close to}} a theoretical TF derived {{on the basis of the}} kinematical flame tracking approach (G-equation) for a uniformly oscillating flow. However, the TF of the jet perturbed flame deviates strongly from the TF of the <b>anchoring</b> <b>ring</b> perturbed flame and demonstrates a typical 'constant time lag' behavior. A TiO 2 smoke tracing of the flow field shows the presence of a convective, sinuous perturbation of the flow core inside the flame cone when the flame is excited by the jet oscillation. In the case of the anchoring rim perturbed flame such a back influence of the perturbed flame on the upstream flow field is weak. Experiments when the flame's anchoring rim oscillates in the transverse direction indicate that the flame base in-out radial motion can be a possible cause of the convective flow perturbation origin. The requirements for the extension of the kinematical type model of the flame response are formulated...|$|R
