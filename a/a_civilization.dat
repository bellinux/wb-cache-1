5|$|If an {{extraterrestrial}} civilization bearing malice towards humanity gained sufficient {{knowledge of}} terrestrial biology and {{weaknesses in the}} immune systems of terrestrial biota, it {{might be able to}} create extremely potent biological weapons. Even <b>a</b> <b>civilization</b> without malicious intent could inadvertently cause harm to humanity by not taking account of all the risks of their actions.|$|E
5|$|In Dyson's {{original}} paper, he {{speculated that}} sufficiently advanced extraterrestrial civilizations would likely follow a similar power-consumption pattern {{to that of}} humans, and would eventually build their own sphere of collectors.

5|$|Rand {{meets with}} the Seanchan, <b>a</b> <b>civilization</b> that invaded the {{continent}} {{earlier in the}} series.

Following the meeting, Tuon declares herself Empress and prepares a surprise attack against the White Tower.|$|E
50|$|These {{conflicts}} {{may result}} {{from a number of}} causes, such as: relative influence or power (military or economic), discrimination against people from <b>a</b> different <b>civilization,</b> intervention to protect kinsmen in <b>a</b> different <b>civilization,</b> or different values and culture, particularly when one civilization attempts to impose its values on people of <b>a</b> different <b>civilization.</b>|$|R

5|$|SETI {{researcher}} Carl Sagan {{believed that}} <b>a</b> <b>civilization</b> with the technological prowess {{needed to reach}} the stars and come to Earth must have transcended war {{to be able to}} avoid self-destruction. Representatives of such <b>a</b> <b>civilization</b> would treat humanity with dignity and respect, and humanity, with its relatively backward technology, would {{have no choice but to}} reciprocate. Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute, disagrees, stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species, and that an explorer civilization that would want to contact humanity would be aggressive. Similarly, Ragbir Bhathal claims that since the laws of evolution would be the same on another habitable planet as they are on Earth, an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization may have the motivation to colonize humanity, much as British colonizers did to the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Technology plays a very {{important}} role in the strategy of the game. As <b>a</b> <b>civilization</b> progresses through the ages, technology becomes more and more expensive, which makes collecting the necessary resources to research them difficult. As a consequence, balancing the workforce of villagers across the various resources can make the difference between victory and defeat.|$|E
5|$|Written by Chris Boucher, {{this story}} was, like The Dreamer of Phados, written to an idea brief from Holmes and Hinchcliffe. It {{was to be}} set on a space ship which has been home to several generations of <b>a</b> <b>civilization.</b> The script was turned down on 30 October 1975.|$|E
50|$|Gradually, {{population}} increased, but at {{the time}} of the story, still below pre-Cataclysmic levels. <b>As</b> <b>civilization</b> returned slowly to normal, explorations were conducted to re-establish contacts between settlements, and to map out the world again.|$|R
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>civilization</b> developed, so too did {{the need}} for units of measurement. These were {{required}} for numerous tasks such as: constructing dwellings of an appropriate size and shape, fashioning clothing, or bartering food or raw materials.|$|R

5|$|According to Tough, an {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{might want}} to send various types of information to humanity by means of artifacts, such as an Encyclop√¶dia Galactica, containing the wisdom of countless extraterrestrial cultures, or perhaps an invitation to engage in diplomacy with them. <b>A</b> <b>civilization</b> that sees itself {{on the brink of}} decline might use the abilities it still possesses to send probes throughout the galaxy, with its cultures, values, religions, sciences, technologies, and laws, so that they may not die along with their civilization.|$|E
5|$|Age of Empires {{requires}} the player to develop <b>a</b> <b>civilization</b> from {{a handful of}} hunter-gatherers to an expansive Iron Age Empire. To assure victory, the player must gather resources in order to pay for new units, buildings and more advanced technology. Resources must also be preserved, as no new resources become available as the game progresses, for example, trees that are cut down will not grow back.|$|E
5|$|Empires: Dawn of the Modern World is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) game {{in which}} the player guides <b>a</b> <b>civilization</b> through five historical periods, from the Middle Ages to World War II. As in many RTS titles, the player collects natural resources, erects buildings, and trains and maintains a military. Players use a mouse cursor interface (or hotkeys) to direct their units, which range from crossbowmen to King Tiger tanks. A three-dimensional (3D) camera system allows the player to view the action from any perspective, including isometric and first-person angles. A mini-map is included as well.|$|E
50|$|Our galaxy {{contains}} {{a huge number}} of worlds inhabited by sentient beings. For most civilizations, interstellar travel, including FTL travel, is routine part of life. <b>As</b> <b>civilizations</b> are constantly in contact with one another, their levels of technological development are roughly the same.|$|R
5000|$|Reappearance factor : The Drake {{equation}} may furthermore be {{multiplied by}} how many times <b>an</b> intelligent <b>civilization</b> may occur on planets where it has happened once. Even if <b>an</b> intelligent <b>civilization</b> reaches {{the end of its}} lifetime after, for example, 10,000 years, life may still prevail on the planet for billions of years, permitting the next civilization to evolve. Thus, several civilizations may come and go during the lifespan of one and the same planet. Thus, if [...] is the average number of times <b>a</b> new <b>civilization</b> reappears on the same planet where <b>a</b> previous <b>civilization</b> once has appeared and ended, then the total number of <b>civilizations</b> on such <b>a</b> planet would be , which is the actual reappearance factor added to the equation.|$|R

5|$|Written by Chris Boucher, was {{submitted}} {{at some point}} after The Silent Scream had been rejected in early 1975.

5|$|Written by Jon Pertwee & Reed De Rouen {{and also}} known as The Brain Drain and The Labyrinth, this seven-part story was {{submitted}} to the production team {{in the summer of}} 1970.

5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may {{take a long time}} to reach the Solar System, once there they would be able to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of <b>a</b> <b>civilization,</b> and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egypt was <b>a</b> <b>civilization</b> {{of ancient}} Northeastern Africa, {{concentrated}} along the lower {{reaches of the}} Nile River in the place that is now the country Egypt. It is one of six historic civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer). The history of ancient Egypt occurred {{as a series of}} stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the belief that}} an extraterrestrial civilization would want to establish an empire, ƒÜirkoviƒá proposes that an extraterrestrial civilization would maintain equilibrium rather than expand outward. In such an equilibrium, <b>a</b> <b>civilization</b> would only colonize a small number of stars, aiming to maximize efficiency rather than to expand massive and unsustainable imperial structures. This contrasts with the classic Kardashev Type III civilization, which has access to the energy output of an entire galaxy and is not subject to any limits on its future expansion. According to this view, advanced civilizations may not resemble the classic examples in science fiction, but might more closely reflect the small, independent Greek city-states, with an emphasis on cultural rather than territorial growth.|$|E
5|$|Resonance of Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the distant future. When {{atmospheric}} pollution nearly annihilates life on Earth, the remnants of humanity construct a purification system called Basel. In time, the surviving human population create <b>a</b> <b>civilization</b> around Basel's central tower, watched over by its mechanical core Zenith. Zenith ties human lives to quartz stones, making them immune to the pollution while giving them predetermined social status and lifespans. The three protagonists‚ÄîZephyr, Leanne, and Vashyron‚Äîform a mercenary group that take odd jobs for the populace of Basel. During their missions, they discover a plan by the city's ruling Cardinals to subvert Zenith's rule, and discover their own connections to the Cardinals' plans.|$|E

5|$|Freitas finds {{numerous}} {{reasons why}} interstellar probes {{may be a}} preferred method of communication among extraterrestrial civilizations wishing {{to make contact with}} Earth. <b>A</b> <b>civilization</b> aiming {{to learn more about the}} distribution of life within the galaxy might, he speculates, send probes to a large number of star systems, rather than using radio, as one cannot ensure a response by radio but can (he says) ensure that probes will return to their sender with data on the star systems they survey. Furthermore, probes would enable the surveying of non-intelligent populations, or those not yet capable of space navigation (like humans before the 20th century), as well as intelligent populations that might not wish to provide information about themselves and their planets to extraterrestrial civilizations. In addition, the greater energy required to send living beings rather than a robotic probe would, according to Michaud, be only used for purposes such as a one-way migration.|$|E
5|$|In another story, Stowe and Calvin {{meet a man}} on a Mandarin dock who {{has been}} cheated out of much the land he was given by the government. Named Old Cudjo, he worked the small {{homestead}} on which he grew cotton for years. Where at first the neighbors surrounding the colony of former slaves from South Carolina were hesitant and suspicious, Old Cudjo and his colony were so industrious and honest that they won their white neighbors over. One who was a justice of the peace intervened on his behalf and Old Cudjo's land was returned to him. Stowe's final chapter is dedicated to defending the notion that blacks should be employed to help build the state of Florida to transform it from a wilderness into <b>a</b> <b>civilization.</b> They are better suited for work in the hot sun, more resistant to malaria, and are trustworthy and extremely eager to learn. She also dedicates a few pages to her interested observations on their culture as she details overhearing their festivities at night and sitting outside an informal church service.|$|E
5|$|Many {{writers have}} speculated {{on the ways}} in which a {{friendly}} civilization might interact with humankind. Albert Harrison, a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California, Davis, thought that a highly advanced civilization might teach humanity such things as a physical theory of everything, how to use zero-point energy, or how to travel faster than light. They suggest that collaboration with such <b>a</b> <b>civilization</b> could initially be in the arts and humanities before moving to the hard sciences, and even that artists may spearhead collaboration. Seth D. Baum, of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, and others consider that the greater longevity of cooperative civilizations in comparison to uncooperative and aggressive ones might render extraterrestrial civilizations in general more likely to aid humanity. In contrast to these views, however, Paolo Musso, a member of the SETI Permanent Study Group of the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, took the view that extraterrestrial civilizations possess, like humans, a morality driven not entirely by altruism but for individual benefit as well, thus leaving open the possibility that at least some extraterrestrial civilizations are hostile.|$|E
