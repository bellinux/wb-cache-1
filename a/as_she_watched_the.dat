5|$|As Styles was {{examining}} the ricochet marks, Alison Cahn {{was approached by}} an elderly woman, who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter—Carmen Proetta—who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a police car travelling north on Winston Churchill Avenue with its siren activated; <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>watched,</b> <b>the</b> police car stopped abruptly and four men—one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes—jumped out. She stated that the three men in plain clothes, all carrying pistols, leapt across the central reservation barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither suspect made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell's handbag. She went on to state that she witnessed {{one of the men}} crouch over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, and continue to shoot them. According to Styles, Proetta's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station; he also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies particularly convincing, believing that only somebody who had witnessed such an event would be able to describe it so vividly. The journalists also discovered that Proetta's account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.|$|E
25|$|Several {{classmates and}} her band leader, Jerry Atkins, {{attended}} her funeral {{two days later}} at her church, Beech Street Baptist. It was held on April 16, at 2 p.m., four hours after Martin's, also during heavy rainfall. Texas High School dismissed at noon that day for her funeral. Hundreds of young people attended the separate funerals. Booker's mother could not control her grief <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> long line of teenagers file by her casket. Atkins {{was one of the}} pallbearers. She was then buried in Woodlawn Cemetery located between 3006 State Line Avenue and 3085 County Avenue. Miss Booker was survived by her mother (died in 1977), stepfather, both grandparents, three aunts and three uncles.|$|E
25|$|In Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn Cathy Davidson {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} attention blindness: humans perceive {{only a fraction of}} everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the multi-task oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic neurological feature of the human brain. In the introduction of Now You See It, Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed to see someone in a full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t even try to keep count, but instead decided to relax <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> tape, and thus, she noticed the gorilla.|$|E

2500|$|The play {{provoked}} {{something of}} an upset. There were complaints about the [...] "horrific" [...] content (particularly the infamous Room 101 scene where Smith is threatened with torture by rats) and the [...] "subversive" [...] nature of the play. Most were worried by the depiction of a totalitarian regime controlling the population's freedom of thought. There was also {{a report in the}} Daily Express newspaper of 42-year-old Beryl Merfin of Herne Bay collapsing and dying <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> production, under the headline [...] "Wife dies as she watches", allegedly from the shock of what she had seen. An anonymous reviewer in The Times wrote: [...] "Inevitably, in a dramatic presentation of the book much of the irony is lost; and the weakness of this television version was that concentrating on the action it reduced the ideological explanation so drastically that it robbed the story of at least half its power". It was a [...] "pictorial simplification" [...] of [...] "Orwell's vision". The writer, however, admired the performances of Cushing, Mitchell and Morell.|$|E
