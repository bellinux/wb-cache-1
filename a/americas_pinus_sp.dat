The term traditional medicine describes the usage of natural resources in order to prevent, treat, and heal human diseases and ailments [14]. Secondary products of forest trees have been used both as a natural medicine and surface coating material. Some woody trees (Juniperus <b>sp.,</b> <b>Pinus</b> <b>sp.</b> Picea sp., Cedrus sp., Betula sp. and Fagus sp.) have been used for tar production since ancient times. Tar production from Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) and Cedrus libani A. Rich. (Lebanon or Taurus cedar) have historical importance an...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the mechanical performance of laminated composite materials (fiberglass, carbon, sisal, palm fiber) in epoxy matrix as reinforcement in wood particleboards of <b>Pinus</b> <b>sp.</b> with bicomponent polyurethane resin from castor oil. Modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) were investigated using a three-point bending test. Single-layered laminated plates were used to reinforce traction of specimens obtained from boards. MOE and MOR of materials developed without reinforcements exceeded limits in ABNT standards both NBR 12810 - 2 : 2002 and A 208. 1 : 199, proving therefore their feasibility. In all investigated cases, inclusion of reinforcements led to higher values for both MOE and MOR. Composites in fiberglass presented the best results...|$|R
