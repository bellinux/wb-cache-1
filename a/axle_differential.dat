50|$|The {{drive shafts}} {{were laid out}} like the US6, but as a mirror image, the front <b>axle</b> <b>differential</b> was offset to the left, while American trucks were offset to the right. Air brakes were used, on the ZiL-157 the air system also {{supplied}} the centralized inflation system.|$|E
50|$|Electric {{vehicles}} {{can also}} use a direct motor-to-wheel configuration which increases the amount of available power. Having multiple motors connected directly to the wheels allows {{for each of the}} wheels to be used for both propulsion and as braking systems, thereby increasing traction. When not fitted with an <b>axle,</b> <b>differential,</b> or transmission, electric vehicles have less drivetrain rotational inertia.|$|E
50|$|Sensitrak {{traction}} management {{monitors the}} speed differential between {{the front and}} rear wheels. If the system detects that the front wheels are slipping, power is automatically directed to the rear wheels. The system reduces wheel slip but not the manoeuvrability. The operator can select permanent 4WD and a manually applied front <b>axle</b> <b>differential</b> lock further boosting traction.|$|E

The Sport Differential selectively distributes torque to the rear axle wheels thereby generating a yaw moment, which improves handling and also stabilizes the vehicle when it oversteers or understeers, thereby increasing safety.|$|E

50|$|The Oshkosh TAK-4 (and TAK-4i) {{suspension}} {{is known}} as double wishbone independent suspension. This is an independent suspension design using two wishbone-shaped arms to locate the wheel.

The shock absorber and spring mount to the lower arm to control vertical movement. The double-wishbone suspension can also be referred to as ‘double A-arm,’ though the arms themselves can be A-shaped, L-shaped, or even a single bar linkage.

40|$|Abstract. To better apply FEA {{technologies}} in product development, viewing {{on the knowledge}} reusing, a knowledge fusion based method was worked out to analyze and optimize product structure. Dynamic knowledge templates were brought into design activities, {{which could be used}} to optimize product solution for more developers conveniently. Therefore, the product design knowledge and optimizing method could be accumulated constantly in enterprises. This method was applied to develop some kind of Drive <b>Axle</b> <b>Differential</b> Gear. Actual application shows that the stress concentration area was found, and the unreasonable expanding mechanism was corrected. And then the design of Differential gear was optimized to improve the carrying capacity of base. Thus, the fracture failure rate would be cut down. The drive <b>axle</b> <b>differential</b> gear which features large loading force was one of important parts of automotive transmission. Due to the complexity of loading case, it's difficult to accurately reflect the distribution of stress and deformation by Traditional design methods. The design process of products and the latest design scheme could be analyzed and optimized by FEA technologies. The technology’s high complexity limited more wide application in enterprises. Viewing on the knowledge reusing, a knowledge fusion based method was brought out. B...|$|E

50|$|Stock {{car racing}} {{was brought to}} Britain in 1954. Taking place on {{existing}} greyhound or speedway tracks, the cars were mostly road cars from the 1930s with locked rear <b>axle</b> <b>differentials</b> and added armour for contact racing. After {{the first couple of}} years custom-built cars began to appear eventually making the 'stock' car name something of a misnomer. Since the early days of stock car racing in Britain the sport has developed into many different classes. In addition, non-contact oval racing became known as Hot Rods, while the original kind of armoured road car used in the 1950s developed into saloon stock cars and unarmoured cars raced in full contact banger racing.|$|R
50|$|The new {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} (IRS) was perceived as being controversial by some {{at the time of}} its introduction. A misconception was that the Expedition's towing and off-road capabilities would be reduced, in comparison to the previous generation's rear live axle. Nevertheless, underbody obstacle clearance improved by half an inch, and up to two inches under the <b>axle</b> <b>differentials.</b> The new suspension reduces rear unsprung mass by 110 pounds, and allows for a full 9.4 inches of suspension travel (how much the wheels can travel up or down) improving its ability to traverse uneven terrain for improved control and ride quality. The four-wheel independent long-travel suspension itself is a purpose-built version of race suspensions found on off-road desert race vehicles.|$|R
