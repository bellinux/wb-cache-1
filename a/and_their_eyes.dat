5|$|The {{reproductive}} behaviour {{of the king}} vulture in the wild is poorly known, and much knowledge has been gained from observing birds in captivity, particularly at the Paris Menagerie. An adult king vulture sexually matures when it is {{about four or five}} years old, with females maturing slightly earlier than males. The birds mainly breed during the dry season. King vultures mate for life and generally lay a single unmarked white egg in its nest in a hollow in a tree. To ward off potential predators, the vultures keep their nests foul-smelling. Both parents incubate the egg for the 52 to 58 days before it hatches. If the egg is lost, it will often be replaced after about six weeks. The parents share incubating and brooding duties until the chick is about a week old, after which they often stand guard rather than brood. The young are semi-altricialâ€”they are helpless when born but are covered in downy feathers (truly altricial birds are born naked), <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> are open at birth. Developing quickly, the chicks are fully alert by their second day, and able to beg and wriggle around the nest, and preen themselves and peck by their third day. They start growing their second coat of white down by day 10, and stand on their toes by day 20. From one to three months of age, chicks walk around and explore the vicinity of the nest, and take their first flights at about three months of age.|$|E
25|$|Members of the {{subfamily}} Amblyopinae are elongated mud-dwelling gobies {{commonly known}} as the eel gobies or worm gobies. Their two dorsal fins are connected by a membranous structure <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> are highly reduced. They are usually pink, red, or purple in coloration. Amblyopinae contain 12 genera and about 23 species.|$|E
25|$|Nomen are black-coated shaggy {{creatures that}} lumber {{on all fours}} in {{preference}} to an upright gait. They are crafty nocturnal hunters who prefer small packs to seeking prey alone. Their hands are clawed, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> are red and seemingly glow in the dark. Nomen will drop on unwary travelers from a forest canopy rather than attempt a direct confrontation. They use basic weapons, favoring the spear most of all. Nomen {{can be found in}} the Dunwood and are said to inhabit the Hest Mountains beyond Inkarra in great numbers. In the distant past, they came north and invaded, but were slaughtered and their numbers greatly reduced.|$|E

500|$|Discussing his onscreen {{relationship}} with Yang, McKidd said: [...] "It's {{not going to}} be easy for them. What I read when I read the season premiere, and this is just my take on it, is that it was very much two very analytical people, Owen and Cristina. They're very similar in a way, I think, as people. Two analytical people see each other over a crowded ER room <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> meet." [...] On the topic of Yang's triumphs and challenges in the eighth season, Oh said: [...] "It has been an extremely challenging year that has had a lot of ups and downs, both challenging and exhilarating. We would shoot all our scenes for a day or two straight, and that was extremely challenging because emotionally and physically it becomes really exhausting." ...|$|E

When I was little, I {{used to see}} these pictures of her with this necklace that had a B on it. I always had a fascination with ancient history, Roman especially, and early English, and I kept imagining her getting her head chopped off, for my whole life. Then, I told my friend Joe, who did the art. He always had an obsession with Marie Antoinette too. She was also decapitated. We also thought about Jayne Mansfield, just {{the idea of a}} woman having her mouth and eyes and ears taken away from her. And, hand grenades, the top comes off. You just pull out the pin and it explodes. So, if you take away someone's mouth <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> and their senses and their brain, they explode. I saw a grenade in my head, I saw taking out the clip, and then I thought of a human body and what happens if you take out the clip." ...|$|E
500|$|Peyton {{explained}} the writing by saying [...] "it always {{comes out of}} an emotional place." [...] One of the writers was Karen Walton, who had previously written the Canadian werewolf film Ginger Snaps. [...] The producers chose the type of animation due to Peyton's personal interest in it, although he later claimed that a day's work could lead to seconds' worth of material. [...] A factory was needed with 8 to 10 teams, {{with some of the}} animators having previously worked on the Tim Burton film Corpse Bride. [...] The characters were made out of plastic and foam. [...] Additionally, some animation was done through computers. [...] Each character's figure had a number of add-on lips to express various sounds, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> and eyebrows were also adjusted frequently during production. [...] The figures could also be fastened into a surface, moved and fastened in again to portray movement. [...] Peyton remarked that [...] "The hardest thing is timing and pacing." [...] Still, he also liked to emphasize that the series did not cost too much money to produce.|$|E

500|$|Producer Bob Ezrin {{had worked}} with Alice Cooper, Lou Reed, and Kiss, as well as {{producing}} Peter Gabriel's debut solo album. At the suggestion of Waters's then-girlfriend Lady Carolyne Christie, who had worked as Ezrin's secretary, the band hired him to co-produce the album. From the start, Waters {{made it very clear}} who was in charge: [...] "You can write anything you want. Just don't expect any credit". [...] Ezrin, Waters, and Gilmour read Waters's concept, keeping what they liked, and discarding what they thought was not good enough. Waters and Ezrin worked mostly on the story, improving the concept. [...] A 40-page script was presented {{to the rest of the}} band, with positive results: [...] "The next day at the studio, we had a table read, like you would with a play, but with the whole of the band, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> all twinkled, because then they could see the album." [...] Ezrin broadened the storyline, distancing it from the autobiographical work Waters had written, and instead basing it on a composite, or gestalt character named Pink. Engineer Nick Griffiths later said of the Canadian producer, [...] "Ezrin was very good in The Wall, because he did manage to pull the whole thing together. He's a very forceful guy. There was a lot of argument about how it should sound between Roger and Dave, and he bridged the gap between them." [...] Waters wrote most of the album's material, with Gilmour co-writing [...] "Comfortably Numb", [...] "Run Like Hell", and [...] "Young Lust", and Ezrin co-writing [...] "The Trial".|$|E

2500|$|The heat killed Allied {{soldiers}}, who foamed at the mouth. The tactics {{along the}} way were gruesome on either side. Allied soldiers beheaded already dead Chinese corpses, bayoneted or beheaded live Chinese civilians, and raped Chinese girls and women. [...] Cossacks {{were reported to have}} killed Chinese civilians almost automatically and Japanese kicked a Chinese soldier to death. The Chinese responded to the Alliance's atrocities with similar acts of violence and cruelty, especially towards captured Russians. Lieutenant Smedley Butler saw the remains of two Japanese soldiers nailed to a wall, who had their tongues cut off <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> gouged. Lieutenant Butler was wounded during the expedition in the leg and chest, later receiving the Brevet Medal in recognition for his actions.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{adaptation}} to a terrestrial life is extensive: {{like all the}} other ratites (ostrich, emu, rhea and cassowary), they have no keel on the sternum to anchor wing muscles. The vestigial wings are so small that they are invisible under the bristly, hair-like, two-branched feathers. While most adult birds have bones with hollow insides to minimise weight and make flight practicable, kiwi have marrow, like mammals and the young of other birds. With no constraints on weight due to flight requirements, brown kiwi females carry and lay a single egg that may weigh as much as [...] Like most other ratites, they have no uropygial gland (preen gland). Their bill is long, pliable and sensitive to touch, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> have a reduced pecten. Their feathers lack barbules and , and they have large vibrissae around the gape. They have 13 flight feathers, no tail and a small pygostyle. Their gizzard is weak and their caecum is long and narrow.|$|E
2500|$|At the glade the prisoners' {{bags were}} taken {{but they were}} {{permitted}} to keep their documents and small belongings. Jews could keep their yellow badges, and people who worked in Pawiak's infirmary could keep their badges with the Red Cross symbol. Sometimes prisoners' hands were tied <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> blindfolded. The victims were then taken {{to the edge of}} the grave and executed by machine gun fire. Sometimes victims were forced to hold a long pole or ladder behind their back. Such supports were later lowered so that the bodies fell into the grave in an even layer. Postwar exhumation proved that the wounded victims were sometimes buried alive. SS and OrPo members photographed the executions until it was forbidden by the SS-StandartenfÃ¼hrer Meisinger, as happened on 3 May 1940. After the execution was finished, the graves were filled in, covered with moss and needles, and then planted over with young pine trees. Families of the victims were later informed by the Nazi authorities that their relatives had [...] "died from natural causes".|$|E

2500|$|Pettoruti's {{choice of}} musicians as a {{recurring}} motif in his artwork began in Europe, {{but he continued}} to represent them through the 1920s back in Buenos Aires. [...] The musicians are either shown alone or in groups, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> are always hidden. [...] The musicians Pettoruti depicted have a cultural link, since they were [...] "directly associated with the tango, the inimitable cultural expression of the Argentine capital." [...] One example of this motif in his painting is Quinteto (1927), depicting five street musicians in the abstracted cubist style. [...] In 1927, he switched from representing musicians to representing harlequins, who similarly always had their eyes covered while looking through masks. [...] For Pettoruti, harlequins were a [...] "useful device for representing the human figure, but as an anonymous, remote, generalized form, not as an individual." [...] Of the many paintings Pettoruti worked on, {{one of his first}} is titled Arlequin (1928), showing one harlequin wearing a mask over his eyes and playing a musical instrument resembling an accordion.|$|E
