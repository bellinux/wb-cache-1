5|$|The {{loanable funds}} {{doctrine}} extends the classical theory, which determined {{the interest rate}} solely by savings <b>and</b> <b>investment,</b> <b>in</b> that it adds bank credit. The total amount of credit available in an economy can exceed private savings because the bank system {{is in a position}} to create credit out of thin air. Hence, the equilibrium (or market) interest rate is not only influenced by the propensities to save and invest but also by the creation or destruction of fiat money and credit.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1957, Nasser nationalized all {{remaining}} British and French {{assets in}} Egypt, including the tobacco, cement, pharmaceutical, and phosphate industries. When efforts to offer tax incentives and attract outside investments yielded no tangible results, he nationalized more companies and made them {{a part of his}} economic development organization. He stopped short of total government control: two-thirds of the economy was still in private hands. This effort achieved a measure of success, with increased agricultural production <b>and</b> <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> industrialization. Nasser initiated the Helwan steelworks, which subsequently became Egypt's largest enterprise, providing the country with product {{and tens of thousands of}} jobs. Nasser also decided to cooperate with the Soviet Union in the construction of the Aswan Dam to replace the withdrawal of US funds.|$|E

5|$|The General Theory {{argues that}} demand, not supply, {{is the key}} {{variable}} governing the overall level of economic activity. Aggregate demand, which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, {{is defined by the}} sum of consumption <b>and</b> <b>investment.</b> <b>In</b> a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government intervention to increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped in a low employment equilibrium – the demonstration of this possibility has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of the work.|$|E
5|$|The {{percentage}} of England's population living in towns {{continued to grow}} but in absolute terms English towns shrunk significantly {{as a consequence of}} the Black Death, especially in the formerly prosperous east. The importance of England's Eastern ports declined over the period, as trade from London and the South-West increased in relative significance. Increasingly elaborate road networks were built across England, some involving the construction of up to thirty bridges to cross rivers and other obstacles. Nonetheless, it remained cheaper to move goods by water, and consequently timber was brought to London from as far away as the Baltic, and stone from Caen brought over the Channel to the South of England. Shipbuilding, particular in the South-West, became a major industry for the first time <b>and</b> <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> trading ships such as cogs was probably the single biggest form of late medieval investment in England.|$|E
