5|$|Telesforo Trinidad {{received}} a Medal of Honor after rescuing two men from <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> explosion {{and is the}} only Asian-American sailor to receive the Medal during peacetime.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} also housed <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> {{house and}} light station, that supplied both steam {{and power to}} the plant, as well as various businesses in the community, such as the Wilmerding YMCA.|$|E
5|$|Yorktown had {{the longest}} career in commission, being {{decommissioned}} {{for the final}} time in 1919; Concord left active service ten years before that, and Bennington {{was taken out of}} service after <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> explosion in July 1905 at San Diego, California.|$|E

5|$|Although several {{survivors}} {{claimed to}} have seen a submarine sail with yellow and red insignia, a Navy inquiry attributed the sinking to <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> explosion. The Navy reversed its findings in 2001 {{to acknowledge that the}} sinking was due to hostile fire and awarded Purple Hearts to the survivors and next-of-kin of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} battle, Nisshin was {{assigned}} to the 3rd Fleet for the invasion and occupation of Sakhalin in July–August. On 2 September 1911, the ship escorted the ex-Russian hospital ship Anegawa to Vladivostok to be returned to the Russians. In November 1912, <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> exploded aboard the ship, killing 20 crewmen. At the start of 1914, she was overhauled with her boilers replaced by 12 Kampon Type 1 water-tube boilers.|$|E
5|$|Sinop {{was named}} after the Russian victory in the Battle of Sinop in 1853. She was built by the Russian Steam Navigation Company (RoPIT) at Sevastopol. She was laid down in late June 1883, {{launched}} on 1 June 1887, and completed in 1889. Sinop began her trials {{in the middle of}} 1889 and she had <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> accident the following year that killed eight and severely burned 10 more. Her machinery was upgraded between 1899 and May 1904 with 20 new Belleville water-tube boilers, but the ship suffered <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> explosion in 1903 that left seven sailors badly burned. Plans for a radical reconstruction were made to be done while she was docked for replacement boilers. It involved cutting her down by one deck and replacing her armament with two twin-gun turrets equipped with 12-inch 40-caliber guns and ten 6-inch 45-caliber guns between the turrets in an armored citadel that used Krupp armor. However, this proved to be too expensive and was cancelled.|$|E
50|$|To qualify, {{one has to}} live in England {{and have}} <b>a</b> working G-rated <b>boiler.</b> Successful {{applicants}} receive a voucher for £400 off the price of either a modern <b>A</b> rated <b>boiler</b> or <b>a</b> renewable heating system (such as <b>a</b> biomass <b>boiler</b> or <b>a</b> heat pump).|$|R
40|$|This master´s thesis {{focuses on}} a design of a heating system in the functionalist villa Stiassni. The {{building}} is located in Brno and {{was used as a}} government villa. The objec-tive of this work is to select the appropriate type of heating system out of three differ-ent heat sources – <b>an</b> automatic pellet <b>boiler,</b> <b>a</b> gas <b>boiler</b> and <b>an</b> oil <b>boiler.</b> The theo-retical part is focused {{on the history of the}} villa Stiassnia, functionalism itself and other functionalist monuments. In the project part, the design of a heating system using the chosen type of heat source, which is <b>a</b> pellet <b>boiler,</b> is described...|$|R

5|$|Assiniboine {{returned}} to Canada in June and was briefly {{used as a}} troop transport before <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> room fire on 4 July effectively ended her career. She was paid off on 8 August and placed on the disposal list. Whilst on tow to the breakers in Baltimore, she ran aground near East Point, Prince Edward Island. Attempts to get her off failed, and she was left to rust until eventually being broken up in place in 1952.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} March 1978, Melbourne left Sydney for RIMPAC 78. During this exercise, Melbourne {{acquired}} the nickname 'Little M' after working with 'Big E' —the smallest and largest aircraft carriers (respectively) in operation at the time. On return in July, the carrier entered a major refit, which continued until 3 August 1979. During this refit, on 3 March, <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> explosion caused minor damage to the carrier. The remainder of the year involved participation in three exercises, Tasmanex off Wellington, New Zealand, Sea Eagle I in the Tasman Sea, and Kangaroo III in the Coral Sea. During Tasmanex, Melbourne lost her LW-02 radar aerial and a Skyhawk, both of which fell overboard during heavy seas.|$|E
5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp {{had to wait until}} the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E
5000|$|The boiler was in two parts: the main, rear part, was <b>a</b> {{water tube}} <b>boiler</b> pressed to [...] (<b>a</b> {{conventional}} <b>boiler</b> {{was limited to}} [...] ). The forward part was <b>a</b> conventional fire-tube <b>boiler</b> pressed to [...] {{and served as a}} feed-water heater.|$|R
50|$|The Class <b>A</b> <b>boilers</b> proved {{inadequate}} for the 19½ inch bore cylinders of the Class C {{so the next}} 34 Class A conversions were to Class C1 with 18½ inch bore cylinders.|$|R
40|$|This bachelor’s thesis {{deal with}} <b>a</b> biomass <b>boilers.</b> In {{the first part}} of this thesis is discribed biomass like a fuel for <b>a</b> <b>boilers.</b> Second part shortly discribes a {{combustion}} proces and possible construction these device. Main thing in this thesis is calculations a exchanger and with it nessesery calculations quantiti of air, produkt of combustion, enthalpy, calculations heat transfer surface and suggestion exchange...|$|R
5|$|Construction was {{not without}} incident. In May 1860, a GNR train {{overshot}} the platform at King's Cross and fell into the workings. Later in 1860, <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> explosion on an engine pulling contractor's wagons killed the driver and his assistant. In May 1861, the excavation collapsed at Euston causing considerable damage to the neighbouring buildings. The final accident occurred in June 1862 when the Fleet sewer burst following a heavy rainstorm and flooded the excavations. The Met and the Metropolitan Board of Works managed to stem and divert {{the water and the}} construction was delayed by only a few months.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930 season, Tinker {{returned}} to baseball {{as a coach}} for the Buffalo Bisons of the International League, who were managed by Clymer. Tinker became {{the manager of the}} Jersey City Skeeters of the International League after the dismissal of Nick Allen in August. The owner of the Springfield Ponies of the Eastern League attempted to convince Tinker to manage his team in 1931. Tinker assumed managerial duties of the Orlando Gulls in mid-May 1937, succeeding Nelson Leach. However, he resigned the position in July of that year, as the team was unable to pay his salary. During World War II, Tinker worked at Orlando Air Force Base as <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> inspector.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the three}} class members, Yorktown had the longest U.S. Navy career, {{spanning}} from her 1889 commissioning to her final decommissioning in 1919. Concord remained afloat the longest: she was decommissioned in 1910, but {{served as a}} training ship for the Washington Naval Militia until 1914, and as a quarantine ship for the Public Health Service in Astoria, Oregon, until 1929. Bennington had the shortest Navy career: she suffered <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> explosion in July 1905 at San Diego, California, that killed over 60 crewmen. Her hulk {{was used as a}} water barge at Honolulu for the Matson Line from 1912 to 1924, when she was scuttled off Oahu.|$|E
50|$|Some rare steam railmotors used {{transverse}} boilers, {{instead of}} the more common vertical boilers, or short locomotive boilers. These were chosen to provide <b>a</b> compact <b>boiler,</b> but with easier servicing than for <b>a</b> vertical <b>boiler.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> {{vertical}} fire-tube <b>boiler</b> or vertical multitubular <b>boiler</b> is <b>a</b> vertical <b>boiler</b> {{where the}} heating surface {{is composed of}} multiple small fire-tubes, arranged vertically.|$|R
5000|$|It is also {{possible}} to burn soy molasses in <b>a</b> dedicated <b>boiler</b> to generate process steam. In combination with a support fuel (e.g. natural gas, ...) the low calorific liquid can be valorized in <b>a</b> steam <b>boiler.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 22 January 1945 Z31, Z34 and Z38 laid {{mines in}} Magerøya, Laafjord, and Brei Sounds. On 25 January, Z31, Z34, and Z38 sailed out of Tromsø, making for the Baltic. On 28 January, while off the Sognefjord, the three destroyers were intercepted by a {{squadron}} of British ships, including the light cruisers Diadem, and Mauritius. During the battle, one of Z38s funnels caught fire, splitting <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> tube. After this Z38 broke off from the battle, and made for Kiel alongside Z34. Once there she received 200 coastal artillerymen, {{to be taken to}} Gotenhafen.|$|E
5|$|On September 2, 1901, the farm's dairy {{buildings}} {{were destroyed by}} fire. The cause of the fire (which was discovered in the dairy building's tower) was unknown, and the damage was covered by insurance. Law quickly arranged for a temporary dairy in a room of the electric plant which had <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> for sterilization; by the afternoon, milk was processed as usual. A larger dairy building was planned closer to the railroad station for faster shipping.|$|E
5|$|A leat runs to {{the east}} of the town's main street but it is {{uncertain}} when it was first constructed. By the early seventeenth century, {{the southern end of the}} leat and one mill are shown on a map. There were three main mills: Higher Mill, Lower Mill and Middle Mill. Higher Mill appears to have always been a corn mill and it continued to produce animal feed until 1974. It has since been converted to housing but a water turbine remains. Middle Mill was used as a woollen mill in the nineteenth century and was also associated with Bilbie's bell foundry (see below). Around 1900, the mill was steam powered and had <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> delivered. It is labelled as an axle works on the 1904 Second Edition Ordnance Survey map. The only remains of Middle Mill are some walls and a chimney base. Lower Mill ceased working in 1968. The building is now in residential use but the sluices (made by Stenner and Gunn of the Lowman Ironworks, Tiverton) can still be seen, as can the water wheel and gearing.|$|E
50|$|A {{historic}} barn is gone, but {{the property}} still had, in 1989, <b>a</b> cane <b>boiler,</b> <b>a</b> smokehouse, and a later-built but still historic automobile garage.|$|R
50|$|The {{expanded}} {{flue gas}} is then routed through <b>a</b> steam-generating <b>boiler</b> (referred to as <b>a</b> CO <b>boiler)</b> where the carbon monoxide in the flue gas is burned as fuel to provide steam {{for use in}} the refinery.|$|R

5|$|A {{series of}} initial ideas were {{presented}} to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated double-ended running, giving the locomotive driver maximum visibility in either direction without <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> or tender obscuring his view. The need for a turntable to turn the locomotive was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the operating department because of problems with welding technique. The accepted design included two 0-6-0 steam bogies with weight-saving sleeve valves and chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing the driver to access both cabs without leaving the locomotive, an arrangement which led to later problems. The firebox, near {{the centre of the}} locomotive, was fed by the fireman from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus often referred to as an 0-6-6-0 tank engine, even though the actual notation is 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both engine units pivoted as on a Garratt, Double Fairlie or Meyer locomotive.|$|E
5|$|By the 1870s, the OSN Company, {{owned by}} the Northern Pacific Railroad, was {{operating}} seven steamboats for transporting wheat and grain from the productive Palouse region along the Snake and Columbia to lower Columbia River ports. These boats were the Harvest Queen, John Gates, Spokane, Annie Faxon, Mountain Queen, R.R. Thompson, and Wide West, {{all of which were}} built on the Columbia River. However, there were more resources along the Snake River than wheat and grain. In the 1890s, a huge copper deposit was discovered at Eureka Bar in Hells Canyon. Several ships were built specifically to transport ore from there to Lewiston: these included Imnaha, Mountain Gem, and Norma. In 1893 the Annie Faxon suffered <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> explosion and sank on the Snake below Lewiston.|$|E
5|$|Destined {{to carry}} wheat and {{phosphate}} fertilizer, both ships sailed initially from New Orleans for St John's in October1941, {{to take on}} cargoes of wheat bound for Ireland. Since insurers such as Lloyd's of London charged higher premiums for ships not in convoy, the Irish Oak and the Irish Pine were painted war-time camouflage in preparation for sailing in-convoy. Irish Pine joined Convoy SC56 and arrived in Dublin on 11December1941. In contrast, Irish Oak experienced a number of serious mishaps and setbacks: Chief Engineer R. Marsh, of Dublin, {{suffered a heart attack}} and was hospitalised in New Orleans; another engineer, O’Keefe of Dún Laoghaire, was severely burned in <b>a</b> <b>boiler</b> room blow-back and hospitalised in StJohn; and a locally recruited Greek replacement engineer caused difficulties, was reported to the Canadian authorities by the captain, and jailed.|$|E
50|$|Up to 1891, 185 were built: 165 by Derby Works and {{the last}} 20 by the Vulcan Foundry. Originally they were built with type <b>A</b> <b>boilers</b> with round-topped fireboxes, but many later {{received}} type G5 boilers with Belpaire fireboxes.|$|R
50|$|The engines had <b>a</b> Crampton <b>boiler,</b> <b>an</b> inside Allan {{valve gear}} and, {{for the first}} time in Württemberg, a Prüsmann chimney. They were {{equipped}} with 2 T 6.5 tenders.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> flash <b>boiler</b> is <b>a</b> type of {{water-tube}} boiler. The {{tubes are}} close together and water is pumped through them. <b>A</b> flash <b>boiler</b> {{differs from the}} type of monotube steam generator in which the tube is permanently filled with water. In <b>a</b> flash <b>boiler,</b> the tube is kept so hot that the water feed is quickly flashed into steam and superheated. Flash boilers had some use in automobiles in the 19th century and this use continued into the early 20th century.|$|R
