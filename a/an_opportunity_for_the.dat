5|$|The Games {{have grown}} {{so much that}} nearly every nation is now represented.

The Games also constitute <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.|$|E
5|$|The Neolithic age, {{which began}} in the Middle East in about 9500BC, was a time when humans became farmers. This {{agricultural}} revolution embraced the development of monoculture and presented <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rapid spread of several species of plant viruses. The divergence and spread of sobemoviruses– southern bean mosaic virus– date from this time. The spread of the potyviruses of potatoes, and other fruits and vegetables, began about 6,600 years ago.|$|E

5|$|Frank Fetter {{was born}} in Peru, Indiana to a Quaker family {{during the height of}} the American Civil War. Fetter proved an able student as a youth, as {{demonstrated}} by his acceptance to Indiana University in 1879 when he was only sixteen years old. At Indiana, he joined the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity. Fetter was on track to graduate with the class of 1883, but left college to run his family's bookstore upon news of his father's declining health. Working in the bookstore offered <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> young man to acquaint himself with some of the economic ideas that would later prove formative. Chief among the intellectual influences Fetter encountered at this time was Henry George's Progress and Poverty (1879).|$|E

He stressed that he has observed that Grameen's borrowers attain a sense of confidence and self-sufficiency when they pay back their loans from Grameen bank. While {{being careful not to}} criticise charity's rightful place, he added that the recipient of a charitable gift does not experience these long-term emotional benefits in the same way.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Grant's {{casualties}} in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, {{but it was never}} issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation which created <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.|$|E

5|$|The Igu Aro festival (counting of the year) was a royal festival the eze Nri used to {{maintain}} his influence over the communities under his authority. Each of these communities sent representatives to pay tribute during the ceremony to show their loyalty. At the end the Eze Nri would give the representatives a yam medicine and a blessing of fertility for their communities. The festival {{was seen as a}} day of peace and certain activities were prohibited such as the planting of crops before the day of the ceremony, the splitting of wood and unnecessary noise. Igu Aro was a regular event that gave <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> eze to speak directly to all the communities under him.|$|E
5|$|At this time, goalkeeper was an {{unsettled}} {{position for}} Manchester City. Len Langford had made over 100 appearances and {{had appeared in}} the 1933 FA Cup Final, which City lost 3–0 to Everton. He missed the final game of the 1932–33 season and the opening match of 1933–34, but went on to play 18 consecutive League games before injury on 16 December 1933 ended his time as City's first choice. Langford's replacement for the following game was James Nicholls, but he endured a torrid time as Manchester City lost 8–0 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Consequently, Swift was given <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Christmas double-header against Derby County. He conceded four goals in his debut at the Baseball Ground on 25 December, but in the return match the next day, his 20th birthday, he kept a clean sheet in a 2–0 win. After making his debut, Swift played in every first team match for more than four seasons, a run of more than 200 consecutive matches. His only absence prior to the suspension of football due to World War II was a single match in September 1938, where without Swift, Manchester City lost 6–1 at home to Millwall.|$|E
5|$|Club captain Noel Spencer was {{released}} by the Mariners, then signed {{to participate in the}} Asian Champions League by Sydney FC after the 2006–07 season, and Alex Wilkinson was appointed the new captain. Only 22 years of age at the time, Wilkinson had played every possible competitive match for the Mariners up to his appointment. In February 2008, Central Coast Mariners signed an arrangement with English Football League Championship side Sheffield United. The partnership was one of several connections the Mariners made with foreign clubs; other partner clubs included Ferencváros of Hungary, Chengdu Blades of China and São Paulo of Brazil. The agreement benefits the club by providing <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> youth programme and senior side to draw from the roster of Sheffield United through transfers. The teams also formed a property development joint venture, in the hopes that Central Coast could use its share of income to expand and bolster their Mariners Youth Academy.|$|E

5|$|Davies {{travelled}} to United Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California on 11 April 1969, {{to produce}} American pop band The Turtles' LP Turtle Soup with engineer Chuck Britz. While in Los Angeles, Davies helped negotiate {{an end to}} the concert ban placed on the Kinks by the American Federation of Musicians in 1965. Although neither the Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, {{at the time it was}} widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. After negotiations with Davies, the Federation relented, opening up <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> group to return to touring in America. Once the main sessions for the Turtles LP were completed, Davies returned to England. While Davies was abroad, the other members of the band had been rehearsing and practising for the upcoming album, as well as lead guitarist Dave Davies' solo album, nicknamed A Hole in the Sock of. When Ray returned, the Kinks regrouped at his house in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, to rehearse the upcoming album Arthur.|$|E
5|$|On {{a flight}} {{home from a}} {{business}} trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman with whom he begins to converse after noticing the two share {{the same kind of}} briefcase. After the flight, the Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. With no one else to contact, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. After a conversation about consumerism, outside the bar, Tyler chastises the Narrator for his timidity about needing a place to stay. Tyler requests that the Narrator hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. The Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area of their city. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men. The fighting eventually moves to the bar's basement where the men form a club ("Fight Club") which routinely meets only to provide <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> men to fight recreationally.|$|E
5|$|Question Time is <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> British {{public to}} put {{questions}} to politicians of every ideological hue. Politicians from the UK's biggest parties appear most frequently, but {{from time to}} time representatives of parties with many fewer supporters – from the Scottish Socialists and Respect to the Green party – also take their seats on the stage. Question Time is the most prominent programme of its kind on British television, and we carefully study the support gained in elections by each of the parties, large and small, before deciding who to invite and how frequently they should appear. It is a straightforward matter of fact that, with some 6% of the vote and the election of two MEPs in this spring's European elections – and with some success in local elections as well – the BNP has demonstrated a level of support that would normally lead to an occasional invitation to join the panel on Question Time. It is for that reason – not for some misguided desire to be controversial, but for that reason alone – that the invitation has been extended.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} {{never took}} place. Instead, the fighter force {{was committed to}} the disastrous Operation Bodenplatte, designed to support German forces during the Battle of the Bulge. Galland's influence on matters was now virtually nil. Appalled by the Ardennes losses, he personally confronted Gollob and criticised him severely. Gollob contacted the Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Himmler's reputation {{as the most powerful}} man after Hitler at that time may have been a prime motive. Gollob complained about his misuse in the Luftwaffe and Galland's leadership. The SS had already spread their influence into other areas of military affairs including the V-2 operations. Himmler, whose relationship with Göring was poor, took the opportunity to exploit the dissent in the Luftwaffe and undermine the Reichsmarschall by supporting Gollob. It was also <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> SS to seize control of the Luftwaffe and for Himmler to oust Göring from power. Göring, for his part offered no support to Galland when Himmler or the SS were mentioned. On 13 January 1945, Galland was finally relieved of his command.|$|E
5|$|The main feud on the Raw brand {{was between}} Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven) and Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista and Snitsky). On the October 25, 2004 episode of Raw, Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair and Batista) {{were put in}} charge of Raw, after General Manager Eric Bischoff took the night off. Triple H granted Flair the match of his choice; Flair wanted a rematch with Orton, as he lost a Steel Cage match to Orton at Taboo Tuesday. Orton {{accepted}} Flair's challenge, with a stipulation that if he defeated Flair he would get an opportunity to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series. Orton, however, lost the match after interference by Triple H, giving the win to Flair, so Orton did not receive <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> World Heavyweight title. On the November 1 episode of Raw, General Manager Eric Bischoff scheduled a traditional 4-on-4 elimination tag team match between Orton, Jericho, Maven and Benoit and Triple H, Batista, Edge and Snistky at Survivor Series. The winning team at Survivor Series would be granted absolute control of running Raw for a month. The following week, Bischoff concluded with adding that the winning members at Survivor Series would all get a week {{to be in charge of}} Raw. That same night, Edge and Chris Benoit were scheduled in a match, where Triple H, Batista, Orton, Jericho and Maven came out to ringside to watch the match. At ringside, a fight broke out between Triple H and Orton's team, which caused the match to end in a No Contest.|$|E
5|$|While II Canadian Corps pushed {{south from}} Caen toward Falaise in Operation Totalize on 8 August, Bradley and Montgomery {{realised}} {{that there was}} <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bulk of the German forces to be trapped at Falaise. The Third Army continued the encirclement from the south, reaching Alençon on 11August. Although Hitler continued to insist until 14 August that his forces should counter-attack, Kluge and his officers began planning a retreat eastward. The German forces were severely hampered by Hitler's insistence on making all major decisions himself, which left his forces without orders for periods as long as 24 hours while information was sent {{back and forth to}} the Führer's residence at Obersalzberg in Bavaria. On the evening of 12 August, Patton asked Bradley if his forces should continue northward to close the gap and encircle the German forces. Bradley refused, because Montgomery had already assigned the First Canadian Army to take the territory from the north. The Canadians met heavy resistance and captured Falaise on 16 August. The gap was closed on 21 August, trapping 50,000 German troops but more than a third of the German 7th Army and the remnants of nine of the eleven Panzer divisions had escaped to the east. Montgomery's decision-making regarding the Falaise Gap was criticised at the time by American commanders, especially Patton, although Bradley was more sympathetic and believed Patton would not have been able to close the gap. The issue has been the subject of much discussion among historians, criticism being levelled at American, British and Canadian forces. Hitler relieved Kluge of his command of OB West on 15 August and replaced him with Field Marshal Walter Model. Kluge committed suicide on 19 August after Hitler became aware of his involvement in the 20 July plot. An invasion in southern France (Operation Dragoon) was launched on 15 August.|$|E
