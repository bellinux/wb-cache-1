40|$|The DGS {{method has}} been {{developed}} for planar disk shaped straight beam transducers generating a rotational symmetric sound distribution in the test material. <b>Angle</b> beam <b>probes</b> using circular or rectangular transducers generate an asymmetric sound field due to the refraction between the wedge and the test material. Today in many test procedures the use of <b>angle</b> beam <b>probes</b> is required. These probes are often equipped with rectangular transducers having the shorter dimension in the plane of incidence, which adds additional asymmetry to the sound field. Despite these facts the measurement results of current <b>angle</b> beam <b>probes</b> are evaluated using the DGS method. Even using correction factors described in literature {{to compensate for the}} rectangular transducer will not result in an accurate DGS evaluation. This fact has recently been proven by extensive measurements on test blocks with flat-bottomed holes (FBH).

But even these instruments do not consider the asymmetric sound field of <b>angle</b> beam <b>probes.</b> In this paper a new approach for conventional and phased array <b>angle</b> beam <b>probes</b> based on numerical modeling is introduced, which avoids the asymmetric sound field in the test material leading to significant higher DGS accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The {{height of}} the {{unwelded}} root part in T and X welds whose length exceeds the sound-beam width at the contact point between {{the sound and the}} reflector can according to methods known today only be estimated by applying the tandem technique with two ultrasonic transverse probes from one single access area, or two access areas, the latter usually not possible in practice. However, with sheets having wide surfacing welds even one-surface access is not applicable due to <b>angle</b> <b>probe</b> dimensions and wide surfacing welds; therefore, an operator often uses a single miniature <b>angle</b> <b>probe</b> of 70 or 80 ° and the AVG method which uses a circular reflector as a reference for comparison, while the actual reflector is an infinite-length reflector inclined towards the direction of the sound beam axis. It therefore follows that the AVG method can in no way enable the estimation of the unwelded root height as the reflected sound wave completely fails to make contact with the receiving probe. Due to instances where the abovementioned welds were demolished in constructions, nearly causing death, we had to look for a more reliable method to control directed reflectors: the transformation of the longitudinal wave into a transverse wave.

In designing and evaluating inspection protocols, {{the number of cases}} that can be studied through laboratory experiments is severely limited by cost and time constraints. Simulations therefore stand to {{play a significant role in}} the design and optimization of inspection strategies for those conditions that can be accurately mod-eled. Moving from benchmark studies for relatively simple geometries toward more realistic conditions creates significant challenges. For shear-wave inspections of fastener holes these challenges include the complex energy field in the thin plates, reflections off the borehole, the complexity of making measurements in the near-field, material anisotropy, cracks as small as 1 mm square, and a sealant layer between aluminum sheets.

In this work, current knowledge {{of the structure of}} austenitic welds is outlined, and the influence of this structure on the propagation of ultrasonic waves is reviewed. Using an established and highly accurate technique, data on velocity variations {{as a function of the}} angle between the direction of soundwave propagation and the axes of preferred grain orientation existing in such welds, are experimentally obtained. These results and existing theory are used to provide quantitative evidence of (i) anisotropy factors in austenitic welds, (ii) beam skewing effects for different wave modes and polarizations, and (iii) the extent of acoustic impedance mismatch between parent and weld metals. The existence of "false" indications is demonstrated, and suggestions are made into their nature.

The area of flaw, height and length of flaw, should be considered from the point of view of fracture mechanics.
