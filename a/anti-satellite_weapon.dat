5|$|The {{decision}} whether {{to proceed with}} Zeus eventually fell to President John F. Kennedy, who became fascinated by the indecision surrounding the ABM system. In 1963, the United States Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, convinced Kennedy to cancel Zeus. McNamara directed its funding towards studies of new ABM concepts being considered by ARPA, selecting the Nike-X concept which addressed Zeus' various problems by using an extremely high-speed missile, Sprint, along with greatly improved radars and computer systems. The Zeus test site built at Kwajalein was briefly used as an <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1960 the Department of Defense (DoD) {{started a}} program called SPIN (SPace INtercept). In 1962, the United States Navy {{launched}} Caleb rockets {{as part of the}} Satellite Interceptor Program, with the objective of developing an <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|E
25|$|The United States of America had not tested an <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapon</b> since 1985. In February 2008 the US {{launched}} its own strike {{to destroy a}} non-functioning US satellite, which demonstrated the capability to strike in space, though {{at a much lower}} altitude than the Chinese test. The US claims that the strike was not a military test but a necessary mission to remove the threat posed by the decaying orbit of a faulty spy satellite with a full tank of hydrazine fuel.|$|E

25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1950s, the United States began {{development}} of anti-satellite weapons. The first United States <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapon</b> was Bold Orion Weapon System 199B. Like the ASM-135, the Bold Orion missile was air-launched; {{but in this case}} from a B-47 Stratojet. The Bold Orion was tested on 19 October 1959 against the Explorer 6 satellite. The two-stage Bold Orion missile passed within 4 miles (6.4km) of Explorer 6. From this distance, only a relatively large yield nuclear warhead would likely have destroyed the target.|$|E
25|$|In theory, an {{airborne}} laser {{could be}} used against hostile fighter aircraft, cruise missiles, or even low-earth-orbit satellites (see <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapon).</b> However, the YAL-1 infrared target acquisition system was designed to detect the hot exhaust of TBMs in boost phase. Satellites and other aircraft have a much lower heat signature, making them more difficult to detect. Aside from the difficulty of acquiring and tracking {{a different kind of}} target, ground targets such as armored vehicles and possibly even aircraft are not fragile enough to be damaged by a megawatt-class laser.|$|E
25|$|The Aegis BMD system, {{coupled with}} the RIM-161 Standard missile (SM-3), has also {{demonstrated}} a limited capability as an <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapon</b> against satellites in the lower portion of low Earth orbit. On February 20, 2008, USA 193 was destroyed {{by a group of}} Aegis ships in the Pacific; the stated reason was concern that satellite's hydrazine payload might contaminate land area upon re-entry from an uncontrolled orbit. The launching vessel was the , and one SM-3 missile was used. Interception was at an altitude of 133 nautical miles (247kilometers).|$|E
25|$|The United States {{developed}} {{direct ascent}} <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapons.</b> A United States Army Nike Zeus missile {{armed with a}} nuclear warhead destroyed an orbiting satellite in May 1963. One missile from this system known as Project MUDFLAP and later as Project 505 was available for launch from 1964 until 1967. A nuclear-armed Thor anti-satellite system deployed by the United States Air Force under Program 437 eventually replaced the Project 505 Nike Zeus in 1967. The Program 437 Thor missile system remained in limited deployment until 1975. One drawback of nuclear-armed <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapons</b> was that they could also damage United States reconnaissance satellites. As a result, the United States <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapons</b> development efforts were re-directed to develop systems that did not {{require the use of}} nuclear weapons.|$|R
50|$|These {{countermeasures}} include <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapons,</b> space weapons, and {{the launching}} of debris in identical but counter-rotating orbits to a space-based defense.|$|R
5000|$|Program 437 was {{the second}} <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapons</b> program of the U.S. military. [...] The US <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapons</b> program began {{development}} in the early 1960s and was officially discontinued on 1 April 1975. Program 437 was approved for development by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara on November 20, 1962, {{after a series of}} tests involving high altitude nuclear explosions. The program's facilities were located on Johnston Island, an isolated island in the north central Pacific Ocean.|$|R
25|$|The NOTS-EV-1 Pilot, {{also known}} as NOTSNIK was an {{expendable}} launch system and <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapon</b> developed by the United States Navy's United States Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS). Ten were launched during July and August 1958, all of which failed. It was the first air-launched rocket {{to be used for}} an orbital launch attempt; however, none was recorded as having reached orbit. Following the first and third orbital launch attempts, a tracking station in New Zealand reported receiving weak signals from the spacecraft; however, this was never confirmed, and the launches were not catalogued as having reached orbit. The Pilot rocket was part of Project Pilot.|$|E
25|$|The NOTS-EV-2 Caleb, {{also known}} as NOTS-500, Hi-Hoe and SIP was an {{expendable}} launch system, which was later used as a sounding rocket and prototype <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapon.</b> It {{was developed by the}} United States Navy's Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS) as a follow-up to the NOTS-EV-1 Pilot, which had been abandoned following ten consecutive launch failures. Two were launched in July and October 1960, before the cancellation of the project. Following cancellation, two leftover Calebs were used in the Satellite Interceptor Program (SIP), while three more were used as sounding rocktets, under the designation Hi-Hoe. These derivatives flew until July 1962, when the Hi-Hoe made its final flight.|$|E
25|$|Two {{examples}} of uncontrolled atmospheric re-entries causing (or almost causing) damage are the 1978 re-entry of Cosmos 954, a Soviet satellite, which landed in Canada and spread dangerous amounts of nuclear fuel from its onboard reactor over {{large tracts of}} land, and Skylab's 1979 re-entry, which rattled windows and dropped small pieces of debris onto buildings in Esperance, Western Australia (no significant monetary damage resulted, but the U.S. was symbolically fined $400 for littering). No weapon existed in 1978 to bring down Cosmos 954, and a Soviet <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapon</b> (Istrebitel Sputnik), {{the first of its}} kind, was declared operational only ten days before Skylab re-entered the atmosphere, and was not capable of directing the space station's descent.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} {{and design of}} <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapons</b> has followed a number of paths. The initial efforts by the USA and the USSR were using ground-launched missiles from the 1950s; many more exotic proposals came afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|The Thor DSV-2 was {{a series}} of {{sounding}} rockets, test vehicles, and <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapons</b> derived from the Thor Intermediate-range ballistic missile. It was also used as the first stage of several Thor-derived expendable launch systems ...|$|R
25|$|From 1961 to 1963, the B-58 was {{retrofitted}} {{with two}} tandem stub pylons under each wing root, {{adjacent to the}} centreline pod, for B43 or B61 nuclear weapons {{for a total of}} five nuclear weapons per aircraft. Although the USAF explored the possibility of using the B-58 for the conventional strike role, it was never equipped for carrying or dropping conventional bombs in service. A photo reconnaissance pod, the LA-331, was also fielded. Several other specialized pods for ECM or an early cruise missile were considered, but not adopted. The late 1950s High Virgo air-launched ballistic missile was designed to be launched from the B-58 with four test launches of the High Virgo carried out by a B-58 to determine ballistic missile and <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapon</b> system capability.|$|E
25|$|At the low altitudes {{at which}} the ISS orbits, there is a variety of space debris, {{consisting}} of different objects including entire spent rocket stages, defunct satellites, explosion fragments—including materials from <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapon</b> tests, paint flakes, slag from solid rocket motors, and coolant released by US-A nuclear-powered satellites. These objects, in addition to natural micrometeoroids, are a significant threat. Large objects could destroy the station, but are less of a threat because their orbits can be predicted. Objects {{too small to be}} detected by optical and radar instruments, from approximately 1cm down to microscopic size, number in the trillions. Despite their small size, some of these objects are a threat because of their kinetic energy and direction in relation to the station. Spacesuits of spacewalking crew could puncture, causing exposure to vacuum.|$|E
2500|$|The {{deployment}} of the ASM-135 was central to a policy debate in the United States over the strategic need for an <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapon</b> {{and the potential for}} <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapon</b> arms control with the Soviet Union. Starting in 1983, the United States Congress starting placing various restrictions on the ASM-135 program. In December 1985, included a ban on testing [...] the ASM-135 on a target in space. This decision was made only a day after the Air Force sent two target satellites into orbit for its next round of tests. The Air Force continued to test the ASAT system in 1986, but stayed within the limits of the ban by not engaging a space-borne target.|$|E
50|$|Space policy intersects {{with science}} policy, since {{national}} space programs often perform or fund research in space science, {{and also with}} defense policy, for applications such as spy satellites and <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapons.</b> It also encompasses government regulation of third-party activities such as commercial communications satellites and private spaceflight.|$|R
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that while safety refers to threats that are non-voluntary in nature (design errors, malfunctions, human errors, etc.), {{security}} refers to threats which are voluntary (i.e. of aggressive nature such as use of <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapons),</b> In some languages a single term is used for both, which may sometimes be confusing.|$|R

2500|$|Beginning in 1985, the Air Force tested an SDIO-funded {{deuterium}} fluoride laser known as Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser (MIRACL) at White Sands Missile Range. During a simulation, the laser successfully destroyed a Titan missile booster in 1985, however the test setup had the booster shell pressurized and under considerable compression loads. [...] These test conditions {{were used to}} simulate the loads a booster would be under during launch. The system was later tested on target drones simulating cruise missiles for the US Navy, with some success. After the SDIO closed, the MIRACL was tested on an old Air Force satellite for potential use as an <b>anti-satellite</b> <b>weapon,</b> with mixed results. The technology was also used to develop the Tactical High Energy Laser, (THEL) which is being tested to shoot down artillery shells.|$|E
