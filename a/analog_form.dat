50|$|Digital {{video was}} first {{introduced}} commercially in 1986 with the Sony D1 format, which recorded an uncompressed standard definition component video signal in digital form instead of the high-band <b>analog</b> <b>forms</b> that had been commonplace until then. Due to its expense, and the requirement of component video connections using 3 cables (such as YPbPr or RGB component video) to and from a D1 VTR that most television facilities were not wired for (composite NTSC or PAL video using one cable was the norm {{for most of them}} at that time), D1 was used primarily by large television networks and other component-video capable video studios.|$|R

40|$|Meteor {{ablation}} spherules are melt {{products of}} meteoroids that enter the earth's atmosphere. They {{are produced by}} aerodynamic melting, a process that surely produced chondrule-like objects in the early solar system but that apparently did not {{play a role in}} forming chondrules found in chondrites.

Although the spheres have strong similarities to meteoritic chondrules, they also differ in significant respects. The differences between the spheres and chondrules suggest that chondrules could not have formed by flash melting of a primitive fine-grained chondritic precursor...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe clostridial neurotoxin, tetanus toxin, is a Zn 2 +-dependent {{protease}} which inhibits neurotransmitter exocytosis by selective cleavage of the synaptic vesicle protein, synaptobrevin. Synaptobrevin {{is thought}} {{to serve as a}} receptor for two neuronal plasma membrane proteins, syntaxin and SNAP- 25, which in the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATP <b>analogs</b> <b>form</b> a 20 S fusion complex with the soluble fusion proteins NSF and α-SNAP. Here we show that synaptobrevin, when in this 20 S complex, or its 7 S precursor, is protected against proteolysis by the enzymatically active tetanus toxin light chain. Our data define distinct pools of synaptobrevin, which provide markers of different steps of vesicle/plasma membrane interaction...|$|R

Using cavity ring-down aerosol extinction spectroscopy, we determine the real and imaginary refractive index at 532 nm of particles formed by benzene photolysis and Titan <b>analog</b> particles <b>formed</b> with ppm-levels of benzene.

5000|$|Copying is the {{duplication}} of information or an artifact {{based only on}} an instance of that information or artifact, and not using the process that originally generated it. With <b>analog</b> <b>forms</b> of information, copying is only possible to a limited degree of accuracy, which depends {{on the quality of}} the equipment used and the skill of the operator. There is some inevitable deterioration and accumulation of [...] "noise" [...] (random small changes, not sound) from original to copy; when successive generations of copy are made, this deterioration accumulates with each generation. With digital forms of information, copying is perfect. Copy and paste is frequently used for information a computer user selects and copies to an area he or she wishes.|$|R

40|$|Background: Muscle cramps {{are common}} {{complains}} during pregnancy muscle cramps occur mostly during nights causing sleep disorder. The causes of muscle cramps are unknown. One probable cause {{could be the}} imbalance between intake and excretion of serum electrolyte such as calcium. Methods: The method used {{for the present study}} was double blind clinical trial. The study was conducted on 60 pregnant women suffering from leg muscle cramps who sought medical treatment in three selected clinics in Bushehr from April 2006 to November 2007. All subjects being third trimester of pregnancy, single pregnant, only used iron and multivitamins. Irregular use of medication, PLP (Preterm Labor Pain), disability completion forms excluded of study. Simple and accessible sampling was used in this study. Selection of study group and placebo were random. Visual <b>analog</b> <b>forms</b> were used to record the number and intensity of muscle cramps. These forms had provisions for 7 days of pretreatment and 28 days of treatments. At {{the end of the first}} week, the subjects were prescribed to take medications every night for four weeks. The subjects were asked to record the intensity of their muscle cramps on the visual <b>analog</b> <b>forms</b> during these four weeks. Results: The number and intensity of muscle cramps were considered in this study. The results of the study showed no significant change in intensity in the two groups. However, there was a significant reduction in the number of cramps in the study group after taking calcium (p=< 0. 02 < 0. 05). Conclusion: Taking calcium resulted in a significant reduction in the number of cramps in this study compared to placebo group. Therefore, prescribing calcium is effective in reducing the number of cramps, when the numbers of occurrences are excessive. In cases of highly intensive and painful cramps, however, taking calcium is as effective as placebo...|$|R
