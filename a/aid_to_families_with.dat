5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two {{welfare reform}} bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich {{and his supporters}} pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding <b>Aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> Dependent Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill {{was signed into law}} by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.|$|E

2500|$|In 1992, {{the state}} of California enacted a statute {{limiting}} the maximum welfare benefits available to newly arrived residents. At the time, California was paying the sixth-largest welfare benefits in the United States. In a move to reduce the state welfare budget, the California State Legislature enacted a statute (Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code Ann. §11450.03) to limit new residents, {{for the first year}} they live in the state, to the benefits they would have received in {{the state of}} their prior residence. [...] For the state to comply with the then-existent <b>Aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> Dependent Children program, it needed a waiver from the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in order to qualify for federal reimbursement. Louis Wade Sullivan, who was HHS Secretary at that point, granted his approval in October 1992.|$|E
2500|$|In writings, {{speeches and}} interviews, Gingrich {{has argued that}} Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and other {{entitlement}} programs are fiscally unsustainable. Without reform, according to Gingrich, this will cause major financial problems, such as large benefit reductions or massive tax increases. In order to avoid these outcomes, Gingrich supports {{what he calls a}} [...] "replacement approach" [...] to entitlement reform. He argues that entitlement programs need fundamental restructuring in order to strengthen incentives for work and productivity. Gingrich cites the reform of <b>Aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> Dependent Children passed in the 1990s as a model for future policymaking. Gingrich has argued that the current welfare and unemployment insurance system continues to create work disincentives that trap people in poverty. He has proposed replacing these systems with an offer of guaranteed employment for the able-bodied, preferably in the private sector to save taxpayer money, or retraining. Beneficiaries who work enough hours would receive Medicare vouchers and housing assistance.|$|E
2500|$|Moynihan issued his {{research}} {{under the title}} , now commonly known as The Moynihan Report. Moynihan's report fueled a debate over the proper course for government to take {{with regard to the}} economic underclass, especially blacks. Critics on the left attacked it as [...] "blaming the victim", a slogan coined by psychologist William Ryan. Some suggested that Moynihan was propagating the views of racists because much of the press coverage of the report focused on the discussion of children being born out of wedlock. Despite Moynihan's warnings, the <b>Aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> Dependent Children (AFDC) program included rules for payments only if no [...] "Man [...] in the house." [...] Critics said that the nation was paying poor women to throw their husbands out of the house. Moynihan went on to formulate Richard Nixon's idea of a Guaranteed Annual Income (GAI) and conducted significant discussions concerning a Basic Income Guarantee with Russell B. Long and Louis O. Kelso.|$|E
40|$|Many local {{studies have}} looked at the {{application}} of poor relief at parish level. This thesis is unique in considering how the rural agricultural parish of Quainton responded to the dearth of 1799 - 1801. It considers how flexible Quainton`s relief system was in response to economic crisis and whether, in this context, it served as a `welfare state in miniature` or was merely a `safety net` for the parish`s labouring poor. The micro-analysis of aggregate data shows that expenditure grew by 144 per cent during the dearth. Quainton, initially, was slow to adopt a modified bread scale. After its adoption, <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> poor <b>families</b> <b>with</b> non-productive children escalated, reaching a peak in March 1801, but quickly declined as wheat prices stabilised. Despite the greater level of support given <b>to</b> these <b>families</b> it is questionable whether they were provided with a subsistence income. Roundsmen`s wages, which had supported Quainton`s unemployed and underemployed labourers, failed at the height of dearth and did not return to a similar level after the crisis. Illness claims and other subsides increased and remained elevated during the 1802 - 1803 fiscal year, compared to levels between 1796 and 1799. In the post-dearth, the level and means of poor relief in some cohorts of recipients declined below the level of support provided in the pre-dearth. Quainton`s poor were hit hard by the dearth. In all, this thesis argues that Quainton`s poor relief system demonstrated a certain level of flexibility and was able to respond to higher prices of provision imposed by the dearth, an expectation of a `welfare state in miniature`. However, only a few tenets of that welfare state remained {{in the aftermath of the}} economic crisis. Therefore, in reality, Quainton`s poor relief system was more of a `safety net` of last resort for the majority of the parish`s labouring poor...|$|R

Kelly, [...] 397 U.S. 254 [...] (1970) [...] decided March 23, 1970, [...] the Supreme Court {{considered}} the issue of New York City residents receiving financial aid under [...] <b>Aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> Dependent Children [...] or the New York State general Home Relief Program who had brought suit challenging the adequacy of procedures for notice and hearing {{in connection with the}} termination of such aid. [...] The three judges in the U. S. District Court for Southern New York entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. [...] The defendant appealed. [...] The United States Supreme Court [...] ruled that procedural due process requires that a predetermination [...] evidentiary hearing [...] be held when public assistance payments were to be discontinued. [...] The procedures followed by New York were constitutionally inadequate in that they failed to permit recipients to appear personally with or without counsel before the official who finally decided the continued eligibility and failing to permit recipient to present evidence to that official orally or to confront or cross examine adverse witnesses.

2500|$|Recent debates have {{centered}} {{on the need for}} policies that focus on both [...] "income poverty" [...] and [...] "asset poverty." [...] Advocates for the approach argue that traditional governmental poverty policies focus solely on supplementing the income of the poor through programs such as <b>Aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> Dependent Children (AFDC) and Food Stamps. According to the CFED , 27 percent of households – nearly double the percentage that are income poor – are living in [...] "asset poverty." [...] These families do not have the savings or other assets to cover basic expenses (equivalent to what could be purchased with a poverty level income) for three months if a layoff or other emergency leads to loss of income. Since 2009, the number of asset poor families has increased by 21 percent from about one in five families to one in four families. In order to provide assistance to such asset poor families, Congress appropriated $24 million to administer the Assets for Independence Program {{under the supervision of the}} US Department for Health and Human Services. The program enables community-based nonprofits and government agencies to implement Individual Development Account or IDA programs, which are an asset-based development initiative. Every dollar accumulated in IDA savings is matched by federal and non-federal funds to enable households to add to their assets portfolio by buying their first home, acquiring a post-secondary education, or starting or expanding a small business.|$|E
