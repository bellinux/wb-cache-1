It concerns the correlation of the terms ?<b>administrative</b> <b>and</b> <b>legal</b> qualification? <b>and</b> ?qualification of an administrative offense?. In practice it is directly reflected on the process and quality of conducting qualification, since neither practical activity is impossible without a theoretical basis. The concept of ?<b>administrative</b> <b>and</b> <b>legal</b> qualification? <b>and</b> its features are often identified with the criminal <b>and</b> <b>legal</b> qualification that is generally wrong. In order to provide own definitions of ?<b>administrative</b> <b>and</b> <b>legal</b> qualification? <b>and</b> ?qualification of an administrative offense? {{the author of the}} article has analyzed different definitions of these categories and highlighted their characteristics and preconditions. It is noted that the precondition for <b>administrative</b> <b>and</b> <b>legal</b> qualification is unlawful act or omission, which later on must be qualified as an administrative offense, and while qualification of administrative offense the preconditions are committed act (actual precondition) and the presence of administrative and tort norm providing liability for committed infringement. Based on the conducted analysis it is concluded that the correlation of <b>administrative</b> <b>and</b> <b>legal</b> qualification <b>and</b> of <b>administrative</b> offense?s qualification as a whole and a part.
