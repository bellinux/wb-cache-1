40|$|Information privacy, {{the privacy}} of {{personally}} identifiable data held by organizations, gained access to the federal policy agenda in the sixties. The passage of several legislative acts resulted in protection for information privacy in specific environments and circumstances. In 1974, the Privacy Act was passed, providing citizens limited protection for data held by agencies of the federal government. While the Privacy Act {{is the cornerstone of}} protection for citizens with regard to government-held data, the law has been less effective than its designers hoped it would be. One major deject of the law is the routine <b>use</b> <b>clause,</b> which has been subjected to broad interpretation and distortion, to the benefit of executive branch agencies which handle personally identifiable data. This article examines the issue of information privacy, with focus on the misuse of the routine <b>use</b> <b>clause</b> and subsequent implications for citizen privacy.

Different <b>clauses</b> are <b>used</b> to implement the different choices of the method; the constraint handling rules are used for rewriting the constraint store during execution. As an example, one can implement backtracking with unit propagation this way. Let [...] represents a propositional clause, in which the literals in the list [...] are in the same order as they are evaluated. The algorithm can be implemented <b>using</b> <b>clauses</b> for the choice of assigning a literal to true or false, and constraint handling rules to specify propagation.
