5|$|Development of the Canning River as {{a source}} of water for Perth was first {{proposed}} in <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first Metropolitan Water Works Board of Perth in 1896. Investigation of the site began in 1897 when engineer Thomas Hodgson surveyed and proposed the dam's current location as a possible site. However, despite the recommendations of further inquiries, and an extreme shortage of water in some years, government funds were not allocated {{for the construction of a}} dam until the Great Depression in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|On September 28, 1862, Gwyn sent {{a letter}} to Colonel Barnes stating that the 118th Regiment did not provide the Philadelphia Inquirer with {{information}} that the paper used to publish a map and <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident. Two days later, Gwyn issued a report on the Battle of Shepherdstown, noting the efforts he made to rally troops to fight back against the Confederate troops, though his efforts were in vain, as Colonel Barnes ordered to regiment to fall back.|$|E

5|$|According to <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trip Armstrong later {{filed with}} the Hawaiian government, any {{negotiations}} for Indian contract labor {{had to be done}} with the British government in London, so no talks were conducted during their time in India. They arrived in Calcutta on May 28 and visited the Alipore Zoological Gardens. Kalākaua spent one day sitting in the Calcutta courthouse to observe India's legal process. Their trip across the British India subcontinent was a sightseeing excursion during their last days before sailing to the Middle East, and they stopped to tour the Ellora Caves prior to reaching Bombay. The King soon tired of the long journey, and was bored and restless by the time they arrived at Bombay, where they remained until the departure of their steamship on June 7. There was more in Bombay to interest him: a shopping trip, the Arab Stallion Stables, the Parsi Towers of Silence, and a visit from businessman Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Scheer sailed in October 1940 on {{her first}} combat sortie. On the night of 31 October she slipped through the Denmark Strait and broke into the open Atlantic. Her B-Dienst radio {{intercept}} equipment identified the convoy HX-84, sailing from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Admiral Scheers Arado seaplanes located the convoy on 5 November 1940, The armed merchant cruiser , the sole escort for the convoy, issued <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German raider and attempted to prevent her from attacking the convoy. The convoy was ordered to scatter under cover of a smoke screen. Admiral Scheers first salvo scored hits on Jervis Bay, disabling her wireless equipment and steering gear. Shells from her second salvo struck the bridge and killed her commander, Edward Fegen VC. Admiral Scheer quickly sank Jervis Bay, but the delay allowed {{the majority of the}} convoy to escape. The Admiral Scheer sank only five of the convoy's 37 ships, though a sixth was sunk by the Luftwaffe following the convoy's dispersal.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{extensively}} {{documented in the}} colonial era. Francisco Ximénez, who first revealed the K'iche' epic Popul Vuh to the world, visited Q'umarkaj in {{the final years of}} the 17th century. Miguel Rivera y Maestre wrote <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site for the government of Guatemala in 1834. In 1840 John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood paid a brief visit to the site after reading Rivera y Maestre's report, and Catherwood mapped the site and produced a drawing of the Temple of Tohil. In 1865, the French architect Cesar Daly mapped the five clustered sites that include Q'umarkaj, although the maps have since been lost. A more detailed survey of the site was made by Alfred P. Maudslay in 1887, being published between 1889 and 1902. Archeological excavations were carried out in the 1950s and the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|When the {{organization}} {{became aware that}} a certain person wanted to hold a reunion with Ojeda Ríos, they would discuss and analize it before approving the meeting, with the Commander issuing <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> topics discussed afterwards. According to the briefing that followed his reunion with bishop González Nieves, it was established that the religious leader tried to convince him {{to move away from}} armed conflict and to abandon clandestine activities. However, Ojeda Ríos responded by replying that, despite respecting the motives behind these suggestions, he declined. He extended an offer of his own to the bishop to join the efforts of the EPB, which was turned down as well.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{contains}} the genetic information that allows all modern living things to function, grow and reproduce. However, {{it is unclear}} how long in the 4-billion-year history of life DNA has performed this function, as it has been proposed that the earliest forms of life may have used RNA as their genetic material. RNA may have acted as the central part of early cell metabolism as it can both transmit genetic information and carry out catalysis as part of ribozymes. This ancient RNA world where nucleic acid would have been used for both catalysis and genetics may have influenced the evolution of the current genetic code based on four nucleotide bases. This would occur, since the number of different bases in such an organism is a trade-off between a small number of bases increasing replication accuracy and a large number of bases increasing the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes. However, there is no direct evidence of ancient genetic systems, as recovery of DNA from most fossils is impossible because DNA survives in the environment for less than one million years, and slowly degrades into short fragments in solution. Claims for older DNA have been made, most notably <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isolation of a viable bacterium from a salt crystal 250 million years old, but these claims are controversial.|$|E
5|$|Eichengrün sent ASA to Dreser's {{pharmacology}} {{group for}} testing, {{and the initial}} results were very positive. The next step would normally have been clinical trials, but Dreser opposed further investigation of ASA because of salicylic acid's reputation for weakening the heart—possibly {{a side effect of}} the high doses often used to treat rheumatism. Dreser's group was soon busy testing Felix Hoffmann's next chemical success: diacetylmorphine (which the Bayer team soon branded as heroin because of the heroic feeling it gave them). Eichengrün, frustrated by Dreser's rejection of ASA, went directly to Bayer's Berlin representative Felix Goldmann to arrange low-profile trials with doctors. Though the results of those trials were also very positive, with no reports of the typical salicylic acid complications, Dreser still demurred. However, Carl Duisberg intervened and scheduled full testing. Soon, Dreser admitted ASA's potential and Bayer decided to proceed with production. Dreser wrote <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> findings to publicize the new drug; in it, he omitted any mention of Hoffmann or Eichengrün. He would also be {{the only one of the}} three to receive royalties for the drug (for testing it), since it was ineligible for any patent the chemists might have taken out for creating it. For many years, however, he attributed Aspirin's discovery solely to Hoffmann.|$|E
