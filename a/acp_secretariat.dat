40|$|After no {{less than}} {{seventeen}} years of service with CTA Mohun Narain, who {{in recent years has}} led CTA s Information Policies and Partnerships Department, is set to enjoy his retirement on his island home of Mauritius. Mohun, who studied agriculture and agricultural extension at Reading University in the UK, worked on his native island until 1981, when he was appointed to the <b>ACP</b> <b>Secretariat</b> in Brussels as agricultural expert. Four years later he was among the first technical staff members to be appointed to CTA in the Netherlands. Speaking to Spore, Mr Narain explained how new ICTs have led to a rethinking of the basic elements of agricultural extension since CTA was established, and how he had enjoyed working in these new areas. But it has been his work in the Pacific and in the Caribbean that has given him the most satisfaction, confirming our suspicions that he is an islander at heart. Mohun, whose quiet diplomacy and sharp mind will be missed at CTA, is looking forward to an active retirement and expects to maintain his involvement with agricultural development.

40|$|Although no {{consensus}} was reached on the intended {{outcome of the}} first phase of ACP-EU negotiations at the ACP-EU ministerial meeting on September 27 th 2002, the ACP side did reach agreement on how it wished to see the negotiations conducted. From the ACP perspective they should be conducted at ministerial and ambassadorial level, with technical preparations being undertaken by the <b>ACP</b> <b>Secretariat</b> {{under the supervision of the}} Committee of Ambassadors. Negotiations will be conducted through six negotiating groups. Each will have a Ministerial spokesperson selected by the ACP Council with two alternate spokespersons. A parallel structure will be established at Ambassadorial level. Comment: Reports suggest that while the European Commission has agreed that an all-ACP structure of negotiations should be maintained throughout the negotiations it is less than enthusiastic about conducting substantive negotiations on issues of common concern to the ACP at the all-ACP level. The Commission is keen to move as quickly as possible to regional level negotiations. This poses a major problem for the ACP. If the Commission is unwilling to enter into substantive discussions at the pan-ACP level on issues of common concern, then it will be extremely difficult to make progress on an ACP-EU framework agreement which could provide the basis for regional level negotiations. This could fracture the unity of the ACP and accelerate the timeframe within which individual ACP regions initiate regional level negotiations with the EU.

40|$|In a {{presentation}} {{to a meeting}} in May 2003 of officials and ambassadors from the Eastern and Southern African region on developing an EPA negotiating mandate for the region, the <b>ACP</b> <b>Secretariat</b> argued that the Cotonou Agreement required that negotiations on EPAs should : be undertaken with ACP countries which consider themselves {{in a position to}} do so, at the level they consider appropriate, and in accordance with the procedures agreed by the ACP Group in the light of regional-integration processes in the ACP; be aimed at promoting economic development, the reduction and eventual eradication of poverty and the smooth and gradual integration of ACP states into the world economy; build on regional integration initiatives and 'not undermine the regional integration processes and efforts'. The presentation further noted that the ACP Group had 'agreed that the first phase could extend from September 2002 through 2003 when a review could take place. The negotiations in the second phase could start in September 2003 '. The uncertainties facing the ACP were highlighted in this presentation particularly with regard to: the future WTO framework for ACP-EU trade relations; the impact of CAP enlargement; the impact of CAP reform; the alternative GSP scheme which would be in place. It was felt that these uncertainties required the development of 'a concerted, coherent and a joint approach not only to the negotiations of EPAs but to regional policy formulation as well'. It also requires close co-ordination between ACP capitals, and their representations in Geneva and Brussels, in order to ensure that everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet. The presentation set out the reasons for the current two-phased approach to the negotiations and the progress to date, noting the areas of convergence and divergence. The greatest convergence was on general principles, namely that EPAs should take full account of local circumstances, fully support regional-integration processes and be built on the wider objectives of the Cotonou Agreement. The highlighted divergences included: disagreement on whether a reform of WTO rules was required to allow the necessary flexibility in the EPA negotiations; the nature of the first, all-ACP phase and its outcome; the need for additional resources. In contrast to the EU's upbeat reporting on the outcome of the May Joint Council of Ministers meeting the <b>ACP</b> <b>Secretariat</b> presentation noted that ACP ministers 'expressed concern over the slow progress in achieving the objectives of the phase 1 of the negotiations'. With regard to the specific regional dimension of EPA negotiations the ACP paper noted that 'the EU is still wedded to its idea of REPAs', but that on the ACP side many issues still needed to be clarified, most notably: the regional configuration for the second-phase negotiations; whether it will it be regional secretariats or member-states governments backed up by the regional secretariats who will negotiate; whether such negotiations would take place in Brussels or the headquarters of the regional secretariats; the role of the Brussels ambassadors and Brussels structures; the definition of 'sensitive products' under liberalisation processes; the extent of transitional periods before full reciprocity is introduced; the impact of reciprocity on fiscal revenues; how the problem of revenue losses can be addressed; the measures which can be adopted to protect vulnerable sectors and industries. Comment: The most striking feature of this ACP presentation was the emphasis placed on the permissive nature of the commitments that ACP governments had made under the Cotonou Agreement rather than the statutory, binding nature of these commitments. This suggests an unease within the ACP over the progress of first-phase negotiations and the possibility of deferring the commencement of second-phase negotiations until further progress has been made in addressing the issues put on the table by the ACP in the first phase of the negotiations.

40|$|Foreword Fishing {{is a vital}} {{source of}} food, jobs and income that {{contributes}} to food security and poverty reduction in many African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) coastal states. But most of these countries, especially Senegal, Mauritania and Namibia, rely heavily on {{a small number of}} exported species. Even so, the fisheries sector provides ACP countries with real longer-term economic opportunities because the EU imports 60 % of the fish consumed in its home market. The heavy toll taken of stocks and ecosystems by over-exploitation of fishery resources is undermining all sustainable development efforts in regions like West Africa. This makes proper resource management and effective control systems vital to avoid over-fishing and the collapse of fish stocks, so that ACP countries can benefit significantly from this sector of the economy. Fisheries relations between the ACP States and the EU are governed by a range of instruments, especially ACP national fisheries policies, the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy, development cooperation instruments and the bilateral fisheries agreements entered into by the EU with individual ACP States. Bilateral agreements give European fishing fleets greater access to fishery resources in exchange for the payment of financial compensation, which is a major source of income for ACP States. These agreements introduce a series of problems in the picture with regard to: (i) sustainable exploitation of marine resources and environmental protection, (ii) protection for artisanal fishing communities, maximizing the benefits of fishing through value-enhancement, and (iv) monitoring systems. These issues of ACP-EU fisheries relations are also addressed in Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) negotiated by ACP countries with the EU. The revision of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) to achieve more sustainable fishing and greater protection of the marine environment should deliver a net gain to ACP fishers. Against this background, CTA works with the <b>ACP</b> <b>Secretariat,</b> European Commission and Commonwealth Secretariat to give ongoing support to ACP countries, not least by providing a forum for ACP and EU experts to exchange information. Over 350 experts and policymakers from ACP and EU Ministries of Trade and Fisheries, along with representatives of the Brussels-based ACP Group, the European Commission, the private sector, NGOs, fisheries associations, international organisations, EU development cooperation agencies and research bodies took part in two technical seminars held in Brussels in April 2003 and December 2004, followed up by an electronic consultation to further explore the two big issues of market access and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU). This publication reviews the main approaches of these players to issues {{at the top of the}} ACP-EU fisheries relations agenda. Improving access to information The recommendations highlight the key role of information and communication technologies (ICT). CTA provides services and products that improve access to information for agricultural and rural development in ACP countries. For example, CTA works together with key partners in the fisheries sector to facilitate in situ or electronic discussion fora, as well as capacity-building and training programmes, and funding participation by ACP experts to present the ACP case in international meetings. CTA also provides information portals (websites) on the fisheries sector - “Agritrade”, “Knowledge for Development”, as well as “ICT Update”, a newsletter specifically on ICT applications in the fisheries sector. For those without Internet access, CTA continues to support a range of other media like rural radio, mobile phones, the print media like the magazine Spore/Esporo, and a wide range of publications, many focused on the fisheries sector. It has also very recently launched a new series of easily-reproducible “how-to” guides providing technical information in easy-to-understand terms, offering yet another opportunity to engage with fishing and fishers. Growing demand from our ACP partners and the importance of the fisheries sector prompts me to reaffirm the commitment of CTA and its partners to further developing these services, providing platforms through which to leverage empirical knowledge, and facilitating the exchange of expertise and experiences. I should also like to take this opportunity to thank all our partners and the ACP and EU authors who so kindly undertook to formulate and finalize the presentation of this wealth of experiences. I hope you will find it instructive reading.

40|$|The recent {{official}} {{recognition of}} CORAF (Conference des Responsables de la Recherche Agronomique Africains/Conference of African Agricultural Research Officers) as {{an association of}} national agricultural research systems is a major step towards making the structure and machinery of agricultural research in Africa truly African. Members of CORAF, {{which was founded in}} Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire in 1987 as an informal 'club', met in Dakar, Senegal in March 1992 to setup a permanent constitution and to define future strategy. By creating a formal structure, the Conference sought international recognition for this regionally-based approach to agricultural research, functioning by means of networks and centres. CORAF's official status is the culmination of a steadily growing collaboration and consultation among African researchers and a progressive move towards Africanizing research systems In its earlier days CORAF's administrative headquarters were in France. Three years after it was set up CORAF met in Madagascar and, although still an informal grouping, it was already on the way to becoming a pan-African organization. As he handed over to his successor, Nya Ngatchou of Cameroon, the outgoing president, Charles Razafindrakoto of Madagascar, proclaimed 'CORAF is becoming truly African and a future for African research is opening up before us. ' At the same time the CORAF Head quarters moved from France to Dakar. The three main French centres for agricultural research CIRAD (Centre de Cooperation International de Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement), ORSTOM (lnstitut Francais de Recherche Scientifique pour le Developpement en Cooperation) and INRA (Institut National de Recherche Agronomiques) will continue to give scientific support to CORAF, but CORAF is sufficiently dynamic now to carry on unaided. Its main strength lies in the research networks of rice, cassava, cotton, groundnut, maize and the drought control campaign set up some five years ago. Regional networks Even before the Dakar meeting last March CORAF had earned itself a reputation for serious and effective work, a reputation which has persuaded international funding agencies to finance some of its regional research projects. Indeed, the originality of the CORAF system lies in its regional focus and structure. This arises from a recognition that countries with overstretched financial resources cannot address all the problems individually. CORAF, therefore, focusses on particular subjects each coordinated by one of its various bases through out the 21 member countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Togo and Zaire). Progress is being made towards opening the association to non-francophone countries. In addition to Nigeria and Sierra Leone who were represented at the Dakar meeting, researchers in other anglophone and lusophone countries are closely associated with CORAF's activities. The politics of research As an organization of 'scientists sans frontieres' CORAF obviously must go beyond a mere sharing of knowledge and laboratories. With the support of the <b>ACP</b> <b>Secretariat</b> General, of CTA and of the French Ministry of Overseas Cooperation CORAF organized a meeting of African ministers with responsibility for agricultural research, in Dakar, recently. This incursion into the world of political decision-making was not only inevitable but also very greatly welcomed by the African members of CORAF. This move into the politics of research was reinforced in Dakar by CORAF's decision to forge even closer links with National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS). CORAF's strategy revolves around three priorities: joint scientific projects carried out by networks and CORAF bases; training, exchange and mobility schemes for scientists in order to speed up the emergence of a pan-African scientific community; and a programme of scientific and technical information in order to better exploit the results of research. CORAF's budget amounts to approximately 110 million French francs (£ 1. 1 m) over five years, of which only 5 % will be spent on administration. The majority will be spend on scientific projects (65 %), developing the networks (22 %) and on the base-centres Interesting results Some significant advances can already be ascribed to CORAF, mainly thanks to its vigorous policy of information exchange and communication among scientists. National institutes have used the network to disseminate some interesting results, mainly in the field of varietal research. From these have emerged new groundnut varieties which are adapted to drought and disease-resistant maize and cassava, which are also in line with consumer taste and the limitations of peasants farming. Through CORAF activities a means of protecting cotton and a crop calendar, which helps Sahelian farmers make the optimum choice of variety and sowing times, have been developed. The existing specialists subject network will probably soon be further reinforced by the addition of networks on: market gardening, pastoralism and forestry. The recent official recognition of CORAF (Conference des Responsables de la Recherche Agronomique Africains/Conference of African Agricultural Research Officers) as an association of national agricultural research systems is a major step towards [...] ...|$|E
