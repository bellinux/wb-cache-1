25|$|I grew up {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis {{and all that kind}} of stuff. And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E

The influence of death metal on the album is clear, and on the subject Jordison stated; [...] "the roots are death metal, thrash, speed metal, and I {{could go on and on}} <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> bands."

Critics have also noted an industrial influence. polarimagazine.com |last=Beck |first=Walter |date=January 17, 2013 |website=Polari Magazine |accessdate=July 4, 2013}} Due to the band's large line-up consisting of additional percussionists and electronics, the album has a very dense, layered sound. Alternative Press stated that the album used [...] "inventive sampling, creative guitar work and an absolute percussive overload", while Q magazine described the album as [...] "a terrifying racket". Slipknot also includes melody, most notably in the single [...] "Wait and Bleed".|$|E
500|$|Many Stanford alumni {{were upset}} with the {{decision}} to hire Shaughnessy. The most popular candidates for the vacant position were two Stanford alumni themselves: San Jose State coach Dudley DeGroot, and Santa Clara coach Buck Shaw. Some believed the Shaughnessy hiring was a ploy to eventually eliminate football at the school, as had happened at both Loyola and Chicago the year prior. The Bay Area media mocked the Shaughnessy hiring as comically inept. They believed that a prestigious academic school had foolishly hired an inveterate loser as its head coach. Prescott Sulivan of the San Francisco Examiner and Jack McDonald of the San Francisco Call-Bulletin coined the nickname [...] "Soup" [...] for Shaughnessy, which they sarcastically explained was a diminutive for the word [...] "super". Sullivan wrote, [...] "We have heard it said that Shaughnessy has developed the knack of losing to the point where, with him, it is an exact science. In light of his record, we aren't at all surprised at this." [...] The Stanford players were also skeptical of Shaughnessy's abilities. Center Milt Vucinich said, [...] "We'd been reading <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were joking among ourselves that wasn't it just like Stanford to hire somebody like this to coach us." ...|$|E

500|$|On July 20, Thome hit {{his first}} home {{run with the}} Orioles, his 610th of all time moving him past Sosa for seventh place all-time, against the Indians at Progressive Field. On August 6, Thome {{was placed on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list with a herniated disk; he remained on the DL until September 21. In his first game back, he drove in the game-winning RBI in extra innings against the Boston Red Sox. After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, [...] "There's a lot [...] memories. I've had great memories on that side and then coming in here as an opponent against them. Any time you come home, they say, it's very special. It's even more special to get the W's. That's, I think, the main thing. The bottom line is I played here a long time." [...] Orioles teammates remarked at Thome's commitment to talking about the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, [...] "I talk the game. When I sit in the dugout during games, I talk baseball to these guys. They'll ask, 'Hey, what's this pitcher like?' or 'What about the game?' 'What <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> Indians teams you were on?' I did it to Eddie Murray {{when he was in his}} 40s." [...] The Orioles made the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Yankees during the AL Division Series. Thome hit [...]133 in the playoffs with no home runs or RBIs.|$|E
2500|$|... "Monster" [...] {{received}} general acclaim upon release. Rolling Stone gave Monster {{four and}} a half stars. Critic Robert Palmer noted that Stipe's lyrics dealt with issues of identity ("The concept of reality itself is being called into question: Is this my life or an incredible virtual simulation?") and that occasionally the singer [...] "begins to sound not unlike the proverbial rock star, whining <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> fans who just won't let him alone." [...] He added, [...] "What's truly impressive about Monster is the way R.E.M. make an album with such potentially grave subject matter so much fun." [...] NME gave the album a seven out of ten rating. Reviewer Keith Cameron wrote, [...] "It’s fun, frequently, but we feel distanced, engaged only on a secondhand level. Moreover, the loudly trumpeted fox factor has been conspicuous by its absence." [...] Cameron concluded, [...] "At best stunning, at worst merely diverting, Monster sounds like the album they 'had' to make, to clear out their system, a simple prop to occupy our time..." [...] Allmusic rated the album {{two and a half stars}} out of five; Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, [...] "Monster doesn't have the conceptual unity or consistently brilliant songwriting of Automatic for the People, but it does offer a wide range of sonic textures that have never been heard on an R.E.M. album before." ...|$|E

[...] In his first address to the team, Shaughnessy told them, [...] "Boys, I am not to be addressed as 'Clark' or, especially, [...] 'Soup'. To you, I am 'Mr. Shaughnessy' or 'Coach.' Nothing else. I am a professor of football... Now, I have a formation for {{you that if you}} learn it well will take you to the Rose Bowl." [...] He asserted that one of his plays, a line plunge by a back without a blocker, would score ten to twelve touchdowns alone, which was more than the Indians had scored the entire previous season. The players were understandably skeptical, and they were not alone. Football innovator and single-wing proponent Glenn [...] "Pop" [...] Warner said before the season, [...] "If Stanford wins a single game with that crazy formation, you can throw all the football I ever knew into the Pacific Ocean." [...] Shaughnessy later discovered that the players, who were mostly returners from the 1939 team, were talented, but not suited to the single wing. As a contemporary newspaper noted, [...] "The [...] team looked great in some games and sour in others. The machinery was there but it wasn't running as smoothly as had been hoped for." ...|$|E
