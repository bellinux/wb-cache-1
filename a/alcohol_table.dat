40|$|In {{the course}} of the {{procedure}} to determine nucleic acids in the polyhedral bodies, or the inclusion bodies of virus particles, of silkworms, it was observed that the major part of the bodies treated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) immediately dissolved in alcohol. The material dissolved in alcohol was proved to be protein in the previous paper. By the presence of TCA, the polyhedral protein dissolves in acetone and in methyl alcohol as well as in ethyl alcohol, but does not dissolve in water, ether, and benzene. This phenomenon {{can be attributed to the}} specialities of both the protein and the acid. Only the polyhedral protein dissolved in alcohol containing TCA, and no protein having such a property was observed (Table 2). The dissolution of the protein in alcohol is caused by a minute amount of some special acids (Table 3). TCA has the strongest effect. The acids which have stronger effect are generally stronger acids, and hydrogen ion is an indispensable factor to dissolve the protein in <b>alcohol</b> (<b>Table</b> 4). However, the effectiveness of acids has no direct relationship to their dissociation constants, and the kind of anions seems to be more important. It is very interesting to note that the two most effective acids, TCA and perchloric acid, are similar to each other in their structures on the electronic aspects. They have likewise three polar radicals around an atom. A linear relationship is observed between the concentration of TCA and the solubility of the polyhedral protein (Fig. 1). The protein dissolves in alcohol by 1 g. of its nitrogen per 0. 01 mole of TCA. The polyhedral protein treated with TCA became insoluble in alcohol by dialysis against distilled water in the refrigerator. But the dialysed protein dissolved in alcohol by a new addition of TCA. From the freshly prepared alcoholic solution which was saturated with the protein upon the definite amount of TCA, the latter was rapidly removed away and gel-formation was brought about by dialysis against alcohol in the refrigerator (Table 5). A hypothesis to explain these phenomena was proposed. 多角体蛋白は微量の特殊な酸を含有する無水アルコールに溶解する. この現象は蛋白質及び酸の特異性に帰せられる. エタノールの外メタノ一ル, アセトンが溶媒として有効である. 有効な酸はある程度以上の強酸であるが,一般に酸の強さと該効果の間には一定の関係は認められない. この酸効果はトリクロール醋酸(TCA) が最も強い.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{comparison}} of the properties of naringinase and pectinase, a clue to destroy or diminish the pectinase activity in the naringinase preparations was obtained. The notable feature was that naringinase was more stable than pectinase in alkaline media. Therefore, stabilities of both naringinase and pectinase were compared in more detail using the same solution of the preparation A from Asp. niger. As reported in the foregoing papers, naringinase was estimated by determining the decomposition of naringin and pectinase was assayed by the formation of galacturonic acid from pectic acid or pectin. Stabilities of both enzymatic activities in alkaline media varied with temperature. Therefore, activities at various pHs were estimated after 20 hrs. at 5 ℃, 20 ℃, 30 ℃ and 37 ℃ and relative activities to original one without treating were shown in Fig. 1. At 5 ℃, stabilities of both activities were almost the same. However, notable difference was observed at 20 ℃. Naringinase activity was maintained between pH 4 and 8, but remarkable reduction of the activity, about 90 %, was brought about at pH 9. 5. On the other hand, 60 % or 90 % reduction of pectinase activity was established at pH 7 or 8, {{even though it was}} stable at pH 6. At 30 ℃, naringinase was also stable at pH 8, whereas only 15 % of activity were remained at pH 8. 5 and completely destroyed at pH 9. 5. At this temperature pectinase was more sensitive 80 % at pH 5, 30 % at pH 6 and about 5 % at pH 7. Of course, both activities were mostly decreased at 37 ℃. Pectinase retained 40 % of the activity at pH 5 and 20 % at pH 6, and almost no activity was remained at pH 7, whereas 90 % of naringinase at pH 7, 27 % at pH 8 and 10 % at pH 8. 5 was maintained. Then the falling of the enzymatic activities at various pHs were followed at definite intervals at room temperature. As seen from Fig. 2, 20 % of naringinase activity were diminished at pH 9. 1 for 2 hrs. and reduction of activity finished by about 5 hrs. retaining 20 % of activity. However, no reduction of the activity was brought about at pH 6. 5, 7. 4 and 8. 2. On the other hand, inactivation of pectinase was accomplished by 2 hrs. at pH 7. 4 and 8. 2, with 80 % and 90 % diminution. Even at pH 6. 5, the water extract of the enzyme, pectinase activity was fallen remarkably with time. These results suggested that the reduction of pectinase activity was attained pretty quickly within about 2 hrs. In considering the supplementary experiment, it might be concluded that the treatment of the enzyme solution at 37 ℃ 2 hrs at pH 8 is the most effective condition for removing the pectinase activity from the naringinase preparation. In order to obtain conclusively the further proof concerning the procedure established above, the naringinase preparation containing no or vague pectinase activity was prepared from low material. Since treatment must be carried out in the solution, naringinase has to be precipitated again. Considering that the enzyme preparation is employed for food, alcohol was preferred as precipitant. At first, the fractionation of the enzymatic activities was examined with 50 %, 75 % and 87. 5 % <b>alcohol.</b> <b>Table</b> 2 indicated that most of the naringinase and pectinase were precipitated with 50 % alcohol accompanying purification and almost completely recovered with 75 % of alcohol. Enzyme preparation was extracted by Mcllvaine buffer of pH 8 in stead of water and fractionated with alcohol, {{in order to make the}} alkaline treatment during extraction and precipitation of the enzyme. However, as seen from Table 3, this procedure was not effective and considerable activity of pectinase was also retained. On the other hand, aqueous solution of the enzyme preparation was adjusted to pH 8 and warmed at 37 ℃ for 2 hrs. Then the enzyme solution was fractionated with alcohol and assayed for the activities of nariginase and pectinase. Thus, the fraction with negligible pectinase activity was obtained as shown in Table 4. Buffer solution of the enzyme of pH 8 was also permitted for treatment. In this case, the treatment must be performed before precipitation with alcohol. The result was cited in Table 5. Finally, enzyme was reprecipitated with alcohol from the fraction A of Tables 3, 4, and 5, which had been obtained with 50 % alcohol from low material. Precipitates were washed with alcohol of 70 %, 80 %, 90 %, 95 % and 100 % successively to remove moisture and dried in vacuo after washings precipitates with ether. Concerning the enzyme powders thus obtained, the activities of pectinase as well as narlinginase were estimated and indicated in Table 6. As evident from the result, it was succeeded in preparing the naringinase preparation which have no pectinase activity. ナリンギナーゼ標品中のナリンギナーゼ及びペクチナーゼの性質特にそのアルカリ耐性の差を利用して酵素中のペクチナーゼ活性の除去を試みた.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to develop a rational and practical test for estimating the co-ordination ability of strength exertion (CASE) and to examine its statistical validity, reliability, and objectivity. Statistical reliability of the test was examined from both standpoints of the variation and the degree of correspondence of measurement values. Objectivity was examined from the correlation coefficient of measurement values by two testers. Validity was examined from two viewpoints as follows: 1) discrimination between different-ability-groups in nervous function, and 2) fall of CASE by drinking <b>alcohol</b> (See <b>Table</b> 1). The test method was form fitting the exertion value of grip strength (GS) to the demand value appeared on display of personal computer (PC). The test of CASE was performed using 2 kinds of description forms on display of PC: bar chart and wave. The demand values of bar chart and wave were sinusoidal wave form of 0. 3 Hz and 0. 1 Hz, respectively. Tracking wave was the range from 5 % to 25 % of maximal grip strength value. The variable estimating CASE was used the total of lags between the demand value and GS value. The findings on the test estimating CASE developed in this study can be summarized as follows: 1) The test has relatively high reliability and can estimate CASE with three trials. 2) The correlation coefficient of measurement values by two testers was significant (0. 617 - 0. 747). 3) The test can discriminate between different-ability-groups in nervous function.

40|$|Sexually Transmitted Infections and HIV and AIDS {{are one of}} {{the biggest}} global health {{challenges}} that cause mortality. Mpumalanga province is one of the province that are also challenged by the prevalence of STIs including HIV and AIDS among youths that is why the researcher was prompted to do the study about the risk behaviours that are affecting youth to expose them to contract STIs including HIV and AIDS. Living a healthy lifestyle is a matter of choice. Living a healthy sexual lifestyle should also be a matter of choice. Unfortunately, among the youth in South Africa it seems as if there are obstacles in the way to make the choice to live a safe and healthy sexual lifestyle. The purpose of this quantitative study was to identify and describe the risk behaviours of youths which can lead to them contracting STIs including HIV and AIDS. It was conducted with 195 respondents who visited two healthcare clinics in Mpumalanga, South Africa. The study was descriptive, non-experimental and contextual in design. Results revealed that youths are presenting with STIs such as gonorrhoea, syphilis, chancroid and HIV and AIDS; therefore, {{there is a need to}} have a strategy to intervene to minimise the spread among youths and to give a support to those who are already infected in the Mpumalanga province. The population for this study was youths between the ages of 18 years to 24 years and the criteria used for the selection of this study was to include only youths who can read or write English or isiZulu and those who are not under psychiatric treatment; therefore, the researcher in this regard complied with the criteria. The pilot study was conducted from the two primary health care clinics prior to test the feasibility of the instrument before the main research study. The respondents who took part during pilot studying were not included in the main study. The data was collected by means of a self-administered data collection instrument and out of 200 respondents, 195 respondents completed the forms and five were returned incomplete. Data analysis was done by the statistician in the University of Pretoria using thestatistical package for the social sciences (SPSS). The findings for this study reported that the majority of respondents were sexually active with n= 162 (83. 1 %) in table 4. 11 and that youths are also involved in risk behaviours of taking drugs when socializing. There is also a prevalence of <b>alcohol</b> and, <b>table</b> 4. 15 show that n= 41 (21 %) of respondents reported that they never used a condom as a protective measure. Therefore these youth are at the risk of contracting STIs including HIV and AIDS. Voluntary counselling and testing programmes need to be strengthened by the programme managers for its effectiveness to empower youths about the information regarding the reproductive system, and to eliminate the information gap among youths. Youths know about the STI infections, but the preventive measures are still a problem as there is no consistency and they do not comply regarding condom use. Youths still need more support and encouragement to go for voluntary counselling and testing for HIV.

40|$|The goal of Expressions of Drunkenness (Four Hundred Rabbits) is to {{contribute}} to ongoing scholarly discussion on the very serious topic of drunkenness. The phrase “four hundred rabbits” {{is one of many}} illustrations of the deep cultural, religious, and social influences on how individuals and communities view alcohol intoxication: The Aztecs believed alcohol to have a divine origin, with a god and a goddess giving birth to 400 (meaning “innumerable” in ancient Aztec) divine children or “rabbit gods,” each representing a varying degree and expression of alcohol intoxication and drunkenness. Hence the book’s subtitle, which at first glance might seem light-hearted but in fact represents an in-depth look at a weighty topic. With such rooted sociocultural factors in mind, the International Center for Alcohol Policies and DrinkWise Australia collaborated to prepare this book to advance current understanding of the individual and collective meanings, purposes, and functions of drunkenness. As the authors explain, interpretations by different disciplines of the terms “intoxication” and “drunkenness” are often inconsistent. The chapters of this book address intoxication and drunkenness from three perspectives: biological, cultural, and social. By placing intoxication and drunkenness into these contexts, the book is able to offer language and conceptual tools to help further the ongoing discussion on how best to reduce alcohol-related harm and encourage responsible enjoyment of beverage alcohol.

40|$|Alcohol {{abuse is}} known to cause illness, disability, and {{premature}} death. It is also a contributing factor in many instances to criminal activity, motor vehicle crashes, and other injuries. Substantial costs resulting from alcohol abuse are incurred in the United States and in California, including the cost of providing medical care for people with alcohol-related illness, treatment and prevention costs, costs to the law enforcement system, costs resulting from alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes and other injuries, and the indirect costs associated with disability, diminished capacity, and premature death from alcohol-related causes. The purpose of this briefing paper is to review the research {{that has been done}} in this area, and to present preliminary estimates of the costs of alcohol abuse in California {{and its impact on the}} state. These estimates are based on research that has been conducted by experts at the national level over the years coupled with some specific analyses conducted for California. We also suggest how one could conduct a thorough study to develop more detailed and refined estimates for the state. THE COST OF ALCOHOL ABUSE IN CALIFORNIA: HIGHLIGHTS 1) The cost of alcohol abuse in California in 2001 totaled $ 17. 8 billion for health service, substance abuse treatment/prevention, lost productivity from premature deaths, and justice system costs (See Appendix Table 11). 2) Nearly 84, 000 hospital discharges resulted from alcohol abuse, including 11, 388 discharges with alcohol dependence syndrome, 9, 314 with alcoholic psychoses, and 8, 115 with cirrhosis of the liver. Almost 16, 000 Californians were hospitalized for injuries that resulted from <b>alcohol</b> use (<b>Table</b> 3 and page 3). 3) Hospitalization costs amounted to $ 1. 3 billion (Table 6). The mean length of hospitalization in non-federal hospitals was 6. 5 days and the mean cost per hospitalization was over $ 12, 000 (Table 5 and page 3). 4) Public programs paid for 64 % of hospitalization costs, including 38 % paid by Medicare, and 19 % paid by MediCal (Table 5 and page 4). 5) Costs of other medical services, including outpatient care, nursing homes, pharmaceuticals, and other health professionals, totaled $ 1. 11 billion (Table 6 and page 4). 6) Health insurance administration costs in California attributed to alcohol abuse amounted to $ 122 million for 2001 (Table 6 and page 5). 7) More than 13, 000 Californians died as a result of alcohol abuse, including 3, 600 who died of primary alcohol-caused diagnoses, over 5, 100 who died of an alcohol –related diagnosis, and 4, 400 who died of an injury attributed to alcohol. These deaths represented lost productivity of nearly $ 8 billion and over 358, 000 life years (Tables 7, 8 and page 6). 8) Criminal justice system costs attributed to alcohol were as high as $ 6. 7 billion including $ 2. 1 billion for police protection, $ 2. 1 billion for judicial and legal services, and $ 2. 4 billion for corrections (Table 9 and page 6). 9) In California’s justice system, 25 % of total police arrests are for alcohol-specific offenses; approximately 43 % of total arrests have been observed to be alcohol-involved (Table 10 and page 6). An estimated 36 percent of state prison and jail inmates were under the influence of alcohol at the time of their convicted offense (Table 9 and page 7). 10) The alcoholic beverage industry paid excise taxes, license fees, and fines totaling $ 350 million in 2001. In addition to $ 41 million in license fees and fines, this included $ 130 million excise taxes on beer sales, $ 19 million on wine sales, and $ 138 million on the sale of spirits (Page 8). 11) Seen as an additional cost for the price of a drink, health care and justice system costs add 18 cents not paid by the drinker. Offsetting beverage industry payments (through excise taxes, license fees, and fines) are less than one cent (Page 13) ...|$|R
40|$|L'élimination de la matière organique et la réduction de volume des boues peuvent être obtenues par incinération, par {{oxydation}} sous pression en milieu humide ("wet air oxidation") ou par combustion en eau supercritique ("supercritical water oxidation"). Une étude en autoclave agité a permis de comparer sur une même boue d'épuration les performances des deux techniques d'oxydation voie humide et d'oxydation supercritique, en mettant l'accent sur les sous-produits résiduels en phase liquide et la composition de la phase gaz. Les résultats obtenus montrent que l'élimination de la DCO dépend fortement de la température: l'abattement de la DCO passe de 70 % à 235 °C à 94 % à 430 °C. L'azote organique de la boue est transformé en NH 4 + mais seule une élimination limitée de l'azote totale est obtenue à 430 °C. Les sous-produits résiduels dans la phase liquide sont constitués en majorité d'acides gras, d'aldéhydes et de cétones, l'acide acétique étant prédominant. Hormis le CO 2, les sous-produits gazeux majeurs formés par des réactions complexes comme la pyrolyse, le réformage et la méthanation sont CO, H 2 et CH 4. Dans les conditions supercritiques, tous les sous-produits gazeux sont fortement oxydés. L'augmentation de la température de traitement permet d'obtenir un résidu solide de plus en plus inerte, les cendres obtenues en conditions supercritiques contenant moins de 1 % de matière organique. Les performances des deux procédés étudiés laissent envisager leur développement à moyen terme comme voies alternatives d'élimination des boues. ContextAs {{the number}} of wastewater treatment plants increases, and the efficiency of treatment improves, {{the problem of how}} to dispose of the ever increasing amounts of generated sludge has intensified. For the beginning of the next century 1 million tons of sludge will be produced annually in France; disposal in landfills will be impossible and agricultural use could be limited by tight quality standards. Therefore, the development of effective and acceptable sludge processes is urgently needed. Destruction of organic matter in sludge and large reductions in sludge volume are achieved either by incineration or by wet air oxidation (WAO), which needs no fuel and generates no smoke, fly ash or emissions of NOx and SO 2. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) offers an attractive alternative. Water, above its vapor-liquid critical point of 374 °C and 221 bar, is an excellent solvent for organic compounds and becomes completely miscible with oxygen. Reported results of sewage sludge SCWO demonstrate rapid and effective treatment. The objective of this study was to compare sub- and supercritical water oxidation of sludge in terms of organic matter destruction and formation of by-products in both gas and liquid phases. MethodologyOxidation of sludge was studied in a 0. 5 L batch reactor rated for 450 °C- 300 bar. The raw material was a biological sludge containing 4 % solids with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) value of 52 g/L. In the standard experimental procedure, 100 mL sludge were heated up to reaction temperature and oxygen was then introduced in 50 % excess with respect to COD. Heating was maintained during 1 hour before slow cooling to room temperature. The overall organic destruction was quantified in terms of total organic carbon (TOC) and COD. Gas and liquid phases sampled at room temperature after reaction were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). Sulfur and nitrogen species were also analyzed. ResultsWhen the temperature increased from 210 to 383 °C, COD destruction increased significantly (Table 1). At 383 °C, a COD destruction efficiency of 94. 3 % was obtained. However, at 430 °C, organic matter oxidation was only marginally improved. In WAO tests, considerable acetic acid was produced and remained in the substrate. The produced acetic acid was oxidized rapidly under SCWO conditions. Surprisingly, the concentrations of the other volatile fatty acids (VFA) remained approximately constant between 310 and 430 °C (Table 2). In addition to VFA, which represent ca. 50 % of the residual COD, oxygenated organic compounds such as aldehydes, ketones and <b>alcohols</b> were produced (<b>Table</b> 3). The data in Table 4 show that decomposition of organic nitrogen compounds into ammonia was completed at 383 °C, while nitrates were reduced to N 2 by reaction with organic matter and ammonia. NOx were not detected in the gas phase. The low reactivity of ammonia in supercritical water had been previously demonstrated. At 430 °C, ammonia removal from sludge was limited to 15 %. On the other hand, even in WAO conditions all sulfur species were totally converted to sulfate. Under subcritical conditions, the gas phase contained significant concentrations of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in addition to water, residual oxygen and carbon dioxide. Traces of methane and C 2 -C 3 hydrocarbons were also detected (Figs. 1 and 2). These gases result from a complex chemistry including pyrolysis, steam reforming and water-gas shift. Under supercritical conditions, all these compounds were extensively eliminated by oxidation. Under supercritical conditions the residual solids contained less than 1 % organic matter. By X-ray diffraction hydroxyapatite, quartz and kaliophilite were identified in the residual solids. These results confirm that supercritical water oxidation is a new sludge treatment concept of great interest. The degree of conversion of organic carbon is high, while liquid and especially gaseous by- products are produced in minor amounts compared to subcritical conditions. Temperatures higher than 430 °C would be needed for substantial nitrogen removal...|$|R
