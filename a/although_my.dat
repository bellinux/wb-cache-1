2500|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1995, Velasquez had begun to work on her sixth studio album, My Love Emotion. She enlisted Japanese songwriters and producers such as Mariya Takeuchi, Kazufumi Miyazawa, and Tatsushi Umeyaki during the album’s recording. <b>Although,</b> <b>My</b> Love Emotion was well received by most critics, some of them criticized it for being {{very similar to the}} formula used on Listen Without Prejudice. David Gonzales from AllMusic described it as [...] "an even better album" [...] and mentioned that it is [...] "more modern and contemporary in tone throughout". However, he felt the similarity from her previous album and noted that the [...] "style of music , have played a large role on Velasquez's albums [...] she doesn't abandon it entirely." [...] The record’s lead single, [...] "My Love Emotion", saw Velasquez collaborate with Southern Sons’ lead guitarist and vocalist, Phil Buckle. After their initial meeting at the Perfect 10 Music Awards in Singapore, Buckle began writing material for the album. The song he had written eventually became the title of the record as well. AllMusic contributor, David Gonzales, called the title track [...] "a triumph" [...] and described it as [...] "an outstanding vehicle, containing a strong melody and hook in the chorus." [...] He further merited Velasquez’s [...] "strong, emotive, and confident" [...] singing. The album’s follow-up single, [...] "You’ve Made Me Stronger", maintained the record’s adult contemporary thematic and reunited Velasquez with songwriter and record producer, Trina Belamide, who had a brief role during the production of her first album under PolyCosmic Records. Speaking of the song’s significant impact on women’s empowerment, Belamide said that it’s a [...] "healing a song [...] it’s about making a bad situation work for you." [...] Velasquez also remarked that the song’s influence has [...] "helped a lot of women reeling from broken hearts." [...] Music critics also complimented Velasquez’s use of a [...] "comfortable register instead of aiming for a higher one, as she did all too often on her previous album, and which made her voice sound thin and unappealing at times." [...] Though the album managed a combined regional and domestic sales of over 375,000 units, My Love Emotion failed to reach the commercial and critical heights of its predecessor.|$|E
