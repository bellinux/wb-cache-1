500|$|The shows {{featured}} couture costumes {{designed by}} fashion house Ralph and Russo. Designer Tamara Ralph said Beyoncé {{asked them to}} be [...] "really creative" [...] while creating items with [...] "an ultra-glamorous feel to them". The duo's inspiration was [...] "modern showgirl", {{paying attention to the}} [...] "comfort and flexibility of each outfit and the ease of getting {{in and out of the}} pieces with quick costume changes". All the crystals for the show were provided by Swarovski; a team of 20 couturiers worked to complete the looks, which were embellished with more than 500,000 crystals from Swarovski Elements in four weeks. Beyoncé wore shoes by Stuart Weitzman. The dancers were dressed in Dolce & Gabbana and David Koma clothes. The band wore Alexander Vauthier clothes while The Mamas wore pin-up girl clothing. Some clothes for the show were also designed by Beyoncé's mother Tina Knowles. Beyoncé also worked with David Koma who designed a panelled bodysuit with lace detailing. Koma described his collaboration during an interview with Vogue, saying, [...] "I absolutely love to work with Beyoncé and her team and I'm very happy that she is back... She looks more beautiful than ever and it's <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> work with her!". Co-designer Michael Russo further described his collaboration with Beyoncé, [...] "Beyoncé always delivers energetic performances... It was an absolute pleasure to work with her to create exquisite pieces that dazzle on stage." ...|$|E

When in opposition he never hesitated to put firmly his party's case. When in office he took a smoother approach towards his supporters and opponents alike. Although he left the House of Commons in 1987 he continued to follow political life and it was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> meet with him. We have lost a major figure from our political landscape".|$|E

After the fight, Morales said [...] "Maybe it's time I should no longer be doing this." [...] He sat speechless in his corner for five minutes afterward. [...] "I did everything in camp necessary to win this fight. I didn't win it. It wasn't my night...it just wasn't meant to be." [...] Asked by Larry Merchant whether he would retire from boxing, Morales offered, [...] "Maybe this is the way to end it.

2500|$|Egyptologists {{who knew}} Omm Sety were {{impressed}} by her knowledge of ancient Egypt. Klaus Baer of the Oriental Institute commented that [...] "she had visions and worshipped the ancient Egyptian gods. But she understood the methods and standards of scholarship, which is usually {{not the case with}} nuts," [...] nor did she [...] "desire to convert anyone." [...] Omm Sety was impressed by Hermann Junker, [...] "one of the elders of 20th century archaeology," [...] who had taught Selim Hassan. He advocated a more honest approach to the study of ancient Egyptian religion, believing that [...] "nobody had made a real effort to go deeply enough into it." [...] She admired his open-mindedness, especially since Junker was also a Catholic priest. [...] One noted Egyptologist, who didn't wish to be named, commented [...] "I was deeply shocked when, one night, I attended a party given by Dr. Ahmed Fakhry behind the Great Pyramid...and there under the full moon was Dorothy Eady belly dancing! I couldn't believe my eyes!" [...] William Murnane of the Oriental Institute recalled [...] "It was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> be with her and listen to whatever she said...you really couldn't take her anything but seriously." ...|$|E
2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film a C, saying [...] "In the Shrek films, the joke of Puss in Boots, with his trilled consonants and penchant for chest-puffing sword duels, {{is that no}} one this cuddly should try to be this dashing. But in Puss in Boots, that joke wears out its welcome in 15 minutes." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots doesn't break any new ground in the {{storytelling}} department, and its reliance on go-go-go state-of-the-art action sequences grows wearying by the end, but the movie has a devilish wit that works for parent and child alike." [...] Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "It's <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> find a family film that respects its audience {{all the way up the}} line." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Remember that toy where you yank a string and hear the sound of a barnyard animal? [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] has about half as much entertainment value." [...] Olly Richards of Empire gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Like most kittens, it's not always perfectly behaved, but at least this new Puss adventure doesn't have you reaching for the cinematic spray bottle. And thank goodness the spin-off does nothing to neuter the charismatic cat's appeal." [...] Stan Hall of The Oregonian gave the film a B, saying [...] "Puss in Boots isn't particularly deep, nor does it take itself seriously -- it just wants to seek glory, win affection and cash in. Done, done and done." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{first single}} from {{the album was}} [...] "Lluvia", a song made in the 1980s by the singer-songwriter Luis Ángel. Pedro notes, [...] "I love the song.

5000|$|Huppert {{expressed}} disappointment at {{the lack}} of scientific understanding amongst MPs. Although he was described by Cambridge Liberal Democrats and The Independent newspaper as [...] "the only scientist" [...] in the House of Commons, in November 2012, Huppert acknowledged other scientists in the House of Commons saying: [...] "Although {{it has been said that}} I am the only scientist in the House, that is sadly not true. I am one of two Members with a science PhD and I went on to do research, but there are other scientists in the House and it <b>always</b> <b>a</b> great <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> have them here." ...|$|R

60|$|The November {{cabinets}} had commenced, {{and this}} brought all the chiefs to town, Sidney Wilton among them; and his society was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> great <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> Endymion; the only social <b>pleasure</b> now left <b>to</b> {{him was a}} little dinner at Mr. Wilton's, and little dinners there abounded. Mr. Wilton knew all the persons that he was always thinking about, but whom, it might be noticed, they seemed to agree now rarely to mention. As for the rest, there was nobody to call upon in the delightful hours between official duties and dinner. No Lady Roehampton now, no brilliant Berengaria, and not even the gentle Imogene with her welcome smile. He looked in at the Coventry Club, a club of fashion, and also much frequented by diplomatists. There were a good many persons there, and a foreign minister immediately buttonholed the Under-Secretary of State.|$|R

60|$|Rollo had no very {{definite}} idea {{of being}} able to fish while on the raft, but there was a sort of instinct which prompted him always to take his fishing line whenever he went on any excursion whatever that was connected with the water. Mr. George had a pretty definite idea {{that he would not be}} able to fish; but still he thought it a good plan for Rollo to take the line, for he observed that to have a fishing line in his pocket, on such occasions, was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> source of <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> boy, even if he did not use it at all.|$|R
40|$|First I {{would like}} to thank Prof. Wolfgang Belzig for giving me the {{opportunity}} to work in exciting fields of quantum transport. The chance to work on different subjects within coherent electron transport, as superconducting junctions, graphene based systems and especially frequency-dependent quantum noise provided a manifold of fascinating research topics. Whenever there was a need for discussion Prof. Wolfgang Belzig had an open door and he also provided the framework for a nice and friendly atmosphere within the group. I also acknowledge the opportunities to participate in different teaching seminars and discussion groups, which helped me to broaden my physical knowledge and kept me in touch with ongoing activities within the physics section. I am grateful to the DFG for the financial support in the framework of the collaborative research centers SFB 513 and SFB 767. I am indebted to Prof. Guido Burkard who agreed to be the second referee of this thesis. He and his group not only enriched the department by the expertise in theoretical solid state physics, but it has <b>always</b> been <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> share physics events as the journal club and social events as christmas parties or movie nights with them...|$|R
40|$|First, {{the conference}} {{planners}} must be complemented for their foresight to put catastrophe insurance {{on the agenda}} for this conference, long before Hurricane Katrina crashed into New Orleans. As Katrina illustrates, the problems affecting catastrophe insurance in the United States are taking on, well, catastrophic proportions. Major changes are required in how the government intervenes {{in each of the}} major catastrophic risks—earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and terrorism. Turning to the task at hand, it is <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> and enlightening <b>to</b> read a paper by David Cummins (2006). This one is no exception. My comments follow the lines of David’s paper, taking up these topics in turn: • Why do private markets for catastrophic risks fail? • Should the government pick up the slack? • And, if so, how is this best done...|$|R

There is a buoyancy in their footsteps, a mirth in their laughter, an expectancy in the way they look around, as though adventures were everywhere. I cannot understand it, but one feels it directly one sets foot in Paris." ...|$|E
60|$|She spat on the iron, and {{a little}} ball of spit bounded, raced off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbed the iron on the sack lining of the {{hearthrug}} vigorously. She was warm in the ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouched and put her head on one side. Her movements were light and quick. It was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> watch her. Nothing she ever did, no movement she ever made, could have been found fault with by her children. The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen. Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her.|$|E
60|$|Whenever {{there was}} a chance of meeting him in Russell Square, that simple and good-natured young woman was quite in a flurry to see her dear Misses Osborne. She went to great {{expenses}} in new gowns, and bracelets, and bonnets, and in prodigious feathers. She adorned her person with her utmost skill to please the Conqueror, and exhibited all her simple accomplishments to win his favour. The girls would ask her, with the greatest gravity, for a little music, and she would sing her three songs and play her two little pieces as often as ever they asked, and with <b>an</b> <b>always</b> increasing <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> herself. During these delectable entertainments, Miss Wirt and the chaperon sate by, and conned over the peerage, and talked about the nobility.|$|R
40|$|It is <b>always</b> <b>a</b> great <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> be able {{to write}} the Support for Learning Editorial. Each edition of the journal {{contains}} a collection of articles which are invariably thought-provoking, sometimes controversial, and always worthy of being read by anyone seeking to be informed about current policy and practice in the field of special and inclusive education. The recent {{growth in the number of}} articles from outside the United Kingdom has enabled readers to look beyond single-country perspectives, adding further value to the journal's content. In undertaking this task I am able to write about articles that have been submitted by authors who have the energy, ideas and commitment to work in the field of SEN and inclusion. This is an undoubted privilege of being Editor of the journal. It is also very much the case that immersing myself in articles that are seamed with optimism is a blessed relief in times of uncertainty and (in respect of egalitarian education and support for those of difference) increasingly single-minded brutality of approach. So before celebrating the content of this issue, I think it is right to pass comment on where we are now. In doing so I make few apologies for my partiality – which is hardly lacking in transparency...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{supported}} by the DFG through the LooPo/HPF project. The text was typeset using the teTEX package and Xemacs; most figures were created using the open source program xfig. Most experiments were conducted using the free HPF compiler ADAPTOR and the open source GNU-Fortran compiler g 77. The LooPo project makes extensive use of the free software packages Polylib, CLooG, PIP, and Omega. Therefore, thanks are due to all authors of the respective packages! Special thanks are due to all members of the LooPo project – former and present: from the beginning, it has <b>always</b> been <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> be part of this team. I am particularly indebted to Dipl. Inf. Thomas Wondrak. He conducted and analyzed an incredible number of experiments. He also provided valuable assistance during the work on his diploma thesis and later on – not only by doing much of the “dirty work ” but also with the valuable discussions we had and with his insightful questions. I am also most grateful to both of my advisors, Christian Lengauer, Ph. D., who gave me the opportunity to work on this thesis, and Priv. -Doz.

60|$|One other {{feature is}} clear--Willie Winter (for these past {{thousand}} years dramatic {{editor of the}} New York Tribune, and still occupying that high post in his old age) was there. He was much younger then than he is now, and he showed 'it. It was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> me to see Willie Winter at a banquet. During a matter of twenty years I was seldom at a banquet where Willie Winter was not also present, and where he did not read a charming poem written for the occasion. He did it this time, and {{it was up to}} standard: dainty, happy, choicely phrased, and as good to listen to as music, and sounding exactly as if it was pouring unprepared out of heart and brain.|$|E
60|$|That {{evening after}} dinner {{he had a}} return of the dizziness, {{though he did not}} faint. He would not ring the bell, because he knew it would mean a fuss, and make his going up on the morrow more conspicuous. When one grew old, the whole world was in {{conspiracy}} to limit freedom, and for what reason?--just to keep the breath in him a little longer. He did not want it at such cost. Only the dog Balthasar saw his lonely recovery from that weakness; anxiously watched his master go to the sideboard and drink some brandy, instead of giving him a biscuit. When at last old Jolyon felt able to tackle the stairs he went up to bed. And, though still shaky next morning, the thought of the evening sustained and strengthened him. It was <b>always</b> such <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> give her <b>a</b> good dinner--he suspected her of undereating when she was alone; and, at the opera to watch her eyes glow and brighten, the unconscious smiling of her lips. She hadn't much pleasure, and this was the last time {{he would be able to}} give her that treat. But when he was packing his bag he caught himself wishing that he had not the fatigue of dressing for dinner before him, and the exertion, too, of telling her about June's return.|$|R
