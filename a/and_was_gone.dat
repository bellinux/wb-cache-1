5|$|The song ended 2007 as the year's fourth biggest-selling {{single in}} the UK and {{remained}} number one into 2008. However, it only managed {{to stay in the}} top 40 for seven weeks, despite being atop the chart for three weeks. It also soon disappeared from the top 100, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> by late February.|$|E
25|$|Warwickshire {{were set}} to chase 291 to win, and Carter {{fulfilled}} {{his job as a}} pinch hitter well, scoring four fours and one six en route to 32, and Nick Knight and Ian Bell kept up with the required run rate well. However, Bell suffered cramps just before he reached 50, and that limited his movements - he succumbed shortly afterwards, chipping a simple catch to Chris Tremlett <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> for 54. The other batsmen tried to add runs with Knight, but yielded to the Hampshire bowling and fielding effort, and when Knight was finally dismissed for 118 Warwickshire needed 40 runs for the last three wickets. Shane Watson effectively stopped that, having Dougie Brown and Ashley Giles out bowled, leaving Warwickshire to hit about 20 runs in the last over. It was too much for Makhaya Ntini, who was bowled by Chris Tremlett with the second ball of the last over, and thus Hampshire took an 18-run victory.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{development was}} around the Church of St Helen and St Giles, {{and this is the}} only medieval building to survive. New prosperity from increased trade in the early 18th century led to several new buildings, including Rainham Hall. Roads were laid out in 1880 and the new developments consisted of semi-detached and terraced houses. At the same time a community developed around a pub on the river and operated as a resort for day-trippers. As the Thames industrialised it declined in popularity <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> by 1945. Rainham developed into a suburb of London after World War I. As the estates were broken up for housing some land was purchased by smallholders from Bow and West Ham. In the 1940s they successfully campaigned against having it returned to agricultural use and it was excluded from the Metropolitan Green Belt. The roadways and sewerage systems did not keep up with the rate of growth and a residents' group fought for improvements in infrastructure throughout the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Mashrafe Mortaza was hit {{around for}} 12 {{in the first}} over, however, and the {{momentum}} swung towards Australia. Mortaza hit back by inducing an outside edge from Matthew Hayden to wicketkeeper Mashud for 1, and four balls later a ball from Mortaza hit captain Ricky Ponting on the pads – but too high to be given out. Gilchrist and Ponting paired up well, however, even though Gilchrist rode his luck with a few drives in the air, but in the tenth over he gave a somewhat dubious catch to slip Khaled Mahmud, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> for 45 – all while rain threatened to damage the match. However, the weather gradually improved, along with Australia's chances – after 15 overs, they were 83 for three, having lost Damien Martyn for 9, but only needed slightly less than five an over. However, economical bowling and riskless batting from Australia saw Bangladesh in with a chance again. Ponting and Michael Clarke let the run rate go to more than six an over, but Khaled Mahmud's bowling at the death to Andrew Symonds left a bit to be desired, as Australia could take the necessary runs and win by 11 balls and six wickets to spare. Interestingly, a Bangladeshi – Shahriar Nafees – got the Man of the Match award, possibly for his effort to keep the match exciting after Bangladesh had crumbled to 75 for 5.|$|E
500|$|Sorkin {{fought with}} the ABC network during the first season {{over the use of}} a laugh track and a live studio audience. The laugh track was widely decried by critics as jarring, with Joyce Millman of Salon.com {{describing}} it as [...] "the most unconvincing laugh track you've ever heard". Sorkin commented that: [...] "Once you do shoot in front of a live audience, you {{have no choice but to}} use the laugh track. Oftentimes [...] is the right thing to do. Sometimes you do need a cymbal crash. Other times, it alienates me." [...] The laugh track was gradually dialed down <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> by the end of the first season. Sorkin was triumphant in the second season when ABC agreed to his demands, unburdening the crew of the difficulties of staging a scene for a live audience and leaving the cast with more time to rehearse.|$|E
500|$|On June 8, Stoughton {{ordered a}} woman accused of {{witchcraft}} (Bridget Bishop) {{to be executed}} only two days later, though tradition had been to allow at least four days between order and execution. The following Monday the clergy were asked to officially weigh in on the issue. This was likely Phips asking for the opinion of Increase Mather, and his son Cotton, and {{to put it in}} writing. The response is called The Return of the Ministers, simultaneously urging caution and speedy prosecution. Most importantly it cautioned against, but did not disallow, or discredit, the admission of spectral evidence (accusations of a crime committed by one's [...] "spector", against which there is no alibi possible). The Mathers, father and son, and the other area ministers continued to debate this issue throughout the summer and into the fall, as documented by the minutes of the Cambridge Association. At the end of June, five more women were condemned to die. Phips granted a reprieve to one of these, but was impressed upon [...] "by some Salem gentlemen" [...] to take it back. At this point, Phips seemed to wash his hands of the proceedings, not relishing the idea of gaining the enmity of his own lieutenant governor and the clergymen allied with him, including the fully committed Cotton Mather, and the waffling Increase Mather. There is no record of Phips ever having travelled north to meet any of the [...] "afflicted", or attend a single Oyer and Terminer trial, or execution. Instead, Phips continued to work on recruiting troops and gathering supplies to build a fort in Maine and he left the province at the end of July, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> the entire month of August and much of September, officially handing over all executive powers to Stoughton in his absence beginning August 1.|$|E
