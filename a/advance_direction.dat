40|$|AbstractUsing the {{software}} FLAC 3 D, we simulated {{the rule of}} deformation and failure of deep stope floor due to working face mining. The horizontal stress, vertical stress, shearing stress, horizontal displacement, vertical displacement, and plastic zone distribution of mined floor are all simulated in both the <b>advanced</b> <b>direction</b> and the tilted direction of working face. Along the <b>advanced</b> <b>direction</b> of working face, the region of floor strata come into being a compression region, an expansion region, and a recompression region; their displacement decrease {{with the increase of}} floor depth. While along the tilted direction, the rock mass under the upper and lower two-side coal mass is in a compressive state, resulting in a vertical compressive displacement and forming a plastic zone of 12. 3 m in depth. Considering the failure depth of floor, the working face water-inrush coefficient of Taoyuan Coal Mines is 0. 082, which is 1. 4 times of the critical value. Therefore, effective measures must be taken to prevent water-inrush from floor aquifer and to ensure the safe mining of working face...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a method and a device for joining {{at least two}} workpieces (1, 2) made of similar or dissimilar metal materials to form a component {{by means of a}} continuously emitting laser beam (3) forming a weld seam along a joining surface. In an interaction region {{in the area of the}} joining surface, the laser beam (3) is partially absorbed and forms a molten bath (11, 12), wherein a part of the joining surface is covered by the molten bath (11, 12), said part forming a load-bearing cross section once the molten mass has solidified. Along the joining surface, the laser beam (3) is focused onto a small beam cross section, with a main direction of the laser beam axis (5) in the direction of the surface normal of the surface of the workpieces (1, 2), upon which the laser beam (3) impinges, and the laser beam (3) is guided along the joining surface of the workpieces (1, 2). A second motion (7) with an oscillating motion component is superimposed on the <b>advancing</b> <b>direction</b> of the laser beam (3), both in the <b>advancing</b> <b>direction</b> and also vertically thereto, wherein the laser beam (3) is applied with an intensity that generates a vapor capillary (8) in the workpieces (1, 2), and the laser beam (3) is continuously coupled into the vapor capillary (8). Starting at said vapor capillary (8), a radial energy transport into the workpieces (1, 2) takes place such that the oscillation of the laser beam (3), and thus of the vapor capillary (8), brings about an energy transport, at least vertically to the <b>advancing</b> <b>direction,</b> said energy transport being directed toward the center of the oscillating motion, thus generating a melting zone...|$|R
40|$|An {{effect of}} tool {{rotation}} direction on forming limit in friction stir incremental forming was studied. A 3 -axes NC milling machine and a hemispherical tool which with {{a diameter of}} 6 mm made of high speed steel was used for forming. The thickness of commercial A 5052 -H 34 aluminum sheet was 0. 5 mm. The forming tool was moved from the outside to inside in a pitch of 0. 5 mm spirally, and the sheets were formed into frustum of pyramid shape. Formability evaluated by minimum wall angle of the pyramid was investigated by changing a tool rotation rate, tool feed rate and tool path direction. When the tool paths were clockwise and counter clockwise, they were defined to “advancing direction” and “retreating direction” {{as well as in}} friction stir welding, respectively. From the experimental results, forming limits by both rotation <b>directions</b> of <b>advancing</b> and retreating were almost the same, however, the range of formable working conditions in <b>advancing</b> <b>direction</b> was slightly wider than that in retreating direction.

40|$|AbstractThis study evaluates ex-ante {{which of}} two signalization {{concepts}} {{is most effective}} at a reorganized arterial road in Hasselt (Flanders; Belgium) : a gantry (<b>advance</b> <b>direction</b> sign above the road) or a cantilever (<b>advance</b> <b>direction</b> sign alongside the road). Over a distance of 500 meters, three intersections {{will be replaced by}} five intersections with traffic lights and the number of sorting lanes will be increased. The complexity of the situation poses a challenge as to how most optimally signalize route guidance. Twenty-two participants drove seven different routes in a medium fidelity fixed-base simulator with a mock-up in front of a single projection screen. Participants were exposed to an animated graphic road environment that integrated a full HD video recording of the actual real life road environment and a virtually developed scenery. The video contained 3 D animations of the foreseen geometric road realignments. We used a within-subject design with origin, destination, and signalization concept (gantry vs. cantilever) as the manipulated conditions in a randomized order. Participants were able to control the rendering of the video simulation by means of the gas pedal, mimicking speed. The direction indicator was used to signal lane switches and route-related decisions at a number of predefined locations. In addition, we recorded eye tracking data by means of a combined FaceLab-EyeWorks system. For each drive, we instructed participants to head for one of the destinations. In the analysis, reaching the destination (outcome of a decision) was less important as the performance at a decision point (optimal or suboptimal). Performance was measured in terms of capacity gains (correct car in the correct lane) and less weaving behavior (as a surrogate of traffic safety). At the end of the experiment the participants completed a short questionnaire. Test scenarios with gantries resulted in more optimal decisions compared to scenarios with cantilevers and participants needed less attempts to reach the correct destination. Compared to the cantilevers, participants had more but equally long eye fixations on the gantries, resulting in a higher total fixation duration time for the latter. The questionnaire showed that 73 % of the participants preferred the gantries over the cantilevers. Based on the simulator study gantries can be considered as more effective in terms of route guidance than cantilevers because they induce the lowest number of maneuvers. Consequently, the recommendation was to equip the reorganized arterial with gantries...|$|E
40|$|Block Hade {{consist of}} a deep thin {{sandstone}} reservoir of two sub-layer reservoirs. The thickness is about 1. 5 m for each layer. The two-layer “staircase” horizontal well is used for recovery. In order to determine water displacement front and edge water movement, tracer test is conducted in the reservoir. But the cycle of field tracer monitoring is about 150 - 360 days. This prevented the efficient monitoring of waterflood swept area and waterflood <b>advance</b> <b>direction</b> and velocity, after the cycle of tracer monitoring. Conservation of mass with respect to tracer flow and history performance matching of tracer enabled the study of water-flood front and edge-water advance. The simulation result is basically consistent with the monitored field tracer results. Therefore, numerical model {{can be used to}} conduct a longer monitoring period. It can make up for the disadvantage of the complexity of the tracer monitoring setup, its implementation, and time-consuming monitoring cycle. The water-flood front, water-flood swept area, advancing velocity and the predominant water injection direction can be obtained. Furthermore, it is possible to evaluate and predict the injection-production well interaction and can also provide a reliable basis to deploy reasonable flood patterns to enhance oil recovery...|$|E
