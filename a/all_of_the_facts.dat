5|$|When Kurt Waldheim {{was named}} {{secretary-general}} of the United Nations in 1971, Wiesenthal reported—without checking very thoroughly—that {{there was no evidence}} that he had a Nazi past. This analysis had been supported by the opinions of the American Counterintelligence Corps and Office of Strategic Services when they examined his records right after the war. However, Waldheim's 1985 autobiography did not include his war service following his recuperation from a 1941 injury. When he returned to active duty in 1942, he was posted to Yugoslavia and Greece, and had knowledge of murders of civilians that took place in those locations during his service there. The Austrian news magazine Profil published a story in March 1986—during his campaign for the presidency of Austria—that Waldheim had been a member of the Sturmabteilung (SA). The New York Times soon reported that Waldheim had failed to reveal <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> about his war service. Wiesenthal, embarrassed, attempted to help Waldheim defend himself. The World Jewish Congress investigated the issue, but the Israeli attorney general concluded that their material was insufficient evidence for a conviction. Waldheim was elected president in July 1986. A panel of historians tasked with investigating the case issued a report eighteen months later. They concluded that, while {{there was no evidence that}} Waldheim had committed atrocities, he must have known they were occurring, yet did nothing. Wiesenthal unsuccessfully demanded that Waldheim resign. The World Jewish Congress successfully lobbied to have Waldheim barred from entering the United States.|$|E

25|$|Some {{economists have}} criticized the {{efficiency}} of democracy, citing {{the premise of the}} irrational voter, or a voter who makes decisions without <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> or necessary information {{in order to make a}} truly informed decision. Another argument is that democracy slows down processes because of the amount of input and participation needed in order to go forward with a decision. A common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by China (a non-democratic country) as compared to India (a democratic country). According to economists, the lack of democratic participation in countries like China allows for unfettered economic growth.|$|E

40|$|Language {{research}} {{carried out}} with <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> computer corpora avails itself, above <b>all,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that modern alphabet-based written language is usually represented in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a linear sequence of ‘words’ (or analogous text elements) interspersed with spaces and punctutation marks. These words, however, both in the language and in the corpus, do no necessarily coincide with units of meaning. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consequent problems for the researcher is how to look for phraseological units in a corpus. In the present paper, the authors decribe the problems encountered while making searches for specific Italian multiword units in an Italian corpus, and how a flexible search program such as DBT {{could be used to}} greatest advantage in order to overcome such problems...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> ChromaDepth {{procedure}} <b>of</b> American Paper Optics {{is based}} on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that with a prism, colors are separated by varying degrees. The ChromaDepth eyeglasses contain special view foils, which consist of microscopically small prisms. This causes the image to be translated a certain amount that depends on its color. If one uses a prism foil now with one eye {{but not on the}} other eye, then the two seen pictures - depending upon color - are more or less widely separated. The brain produces the spatial impression from this difference. <b>The</b> advantage <b>of</b> this technology consists above <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that one can regard ChromaDepth pictures also without eyeglasses (thus two-dimensional) problem-free (unlike with two-color anaglyph). However the colors are only limitedly selectable, since they contain <b>the</b> depth information <b>of</b> <b>the</b> picture. If one changes <b>the</b> color <b>of</b> an object, then its observed distance will also be changed.|$|R

2500|$|In May 1983, Mrs Thatcher {{appeared}} on Nationwide, a live television show on BBC1, where a teacher, Diana Gould, , {{saying that the}} ship was already west of the Falklands and heading towards the Argentinian mainland to the west. Gould {{also said that the}} Peruvian peace proposal must have reached London in the 14 hours between its publication and the sinking of General Belgrano, and the escalation of the war could have thus been prevented. In the emotional exchange that followed, Thatcher answered that the vessel was a threat to British ships and lives and denied that the peace proposal had reached her. She added that [...] "One day, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts,</b> in about 30 years time, will be published", apparently a reference to a classified report prepared by intelligence officer Major David Thorp for Thatcher after the incident.
