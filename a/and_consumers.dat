40|$|Abstract Objective To {{collaborate}} with <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community {{representatives in the}} Alcohol and Pregnancy Project from 2006 - 2008 [URL] and evaluate researchers' <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives' perceptions of the process, context <b>and</b> impact of <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community participation in the project. Methods We formed two reference groups <b>and</b> sought <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives' perspectives on {{all aspects of the}} project over a three year period. We developed an evaluation framework <b>and</b> asked <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives and researchers to complete a self-administered questionnaire {{at the end of the}} project. Results Fifteen researchers (93. 8 %) and seven (53. 8 %) <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives completed a questionnaire. Most <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives agreed that the process and context measures of their participation had been achieved. Both researchers <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives identified areas for improvement and offered suggestions how these could be improved for future research. Researchers thought <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community participation contributed to project outputs and outcomes by enhancing scientific and ethical standards, providing legitimacy and authority, and increasing the project's credibility and participation. They saw it was fundamental to the research process <b>and</b> acknowledged <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives for their excellent contribution. <b>Consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives were able to directly influence decisions about the research. They thought that <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community participation had significant influence on the success of project outputs <b>and</b> outcomes. Conclusions <b>Consumer</b> <b>and</b> community participation is an essential component of good research practice and contributed to the Alcohol and Pregnancy Project by enhancing research processes, outputs and outcomes, and this participation was valued by community <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> representatives <b>and</b> researchers. The National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia expects researchers to work in partnership <b>and</b> involve <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives in health and medical research, and to evaluate community <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> participation. It is important to demonstrate whether <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community participation makes a difference to health and medical research. </p...|$|R

The park blocks underwent serious renovations in 1987, adding plazas, large flower beds, lighting and irrigation, and newly paved sidewalks. Several apartment complexes specifically aimed at the middle class were built, including the University Park Apartments (125 units, $10.5 million, quickly sold and converted to condos), South Park Square Apartments (184 units, $16 million, completed May 1988), and Tom Mesher's Gallery Park Apartments (31 units, $3 million).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{facilitate}} informed decision-making in the development of a curriculum guide for Massachusetts family <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> sciences education programs by gathering new knowledge related to the National Standards for Family <b>and</b> <b>Consumer</b> Sciences Education (National Association of State Administrators of Family <b>and</b> <b>Consumer</b> Sciences·Vocational-Technical Education Consortium of States [NASAFACS·V-TECS], 1998). The three goals of this study were: (1) to determine the perceived importance of each of the 16 areas of study of the National Standards for Family <b>and</b> <b>Consumer</b> Sciences Education (NASAFACS·V-TECS, 1998) in meeting the national family <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> sciences education vision, (2) to determine the perceived importance of each of the 86 content standards of the National Standards for Family <b>and</b> <b>Consumer</b> Sciences Education (NASAFACS·V-TECS, 1998) in meeting the national family <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> sciences education vision, and (3) to determine how often each content standard is taught in local family <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> sciences education programs in Massachusetts. The national vision states that: “Family <b>and</b> <b>Consumer</b> Sciences Education empowers individuals and families across the life span to manage the challenges of living in a diverse global society. Our unique focus is on families, work, and their interrelationships” (NASAFACS·V-TECS, 1998, p. 2). ^ The descriptive survey involved data collection from a national population of head state administrators of family <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> sciences <b>and</b> the population of Massachusetts family <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> sciences education professionals. The study found that whereas the question asked respondents to identify six areas of study, the results indicated that seven areas of study were perceived as distinctly more important. Six of the seven family <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> sciences education areas of study were selected as more important by both the head state administrators and the Massachusetts professionals. These areas of study were: parenting; interpersonal relations; human development; family; career, community, and family connections; and nutrition and wellness. The Massachusetts professionals included the early childhood, education, and services as one of the seven more important areas of study, whereas the head state administrators selected the <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> family resources as one of the seven more important areas of study. ...|$|R

5|$|In June 1904, {{during the}} experiments, Zammit {{learned that a}} Maltese family of five members became {{simultaneously}} ill after consuming fresh unpasteurized milk from goats.

Zammit was successful in the discovery of the disease. David Bruce, who led the MFC, discouraged the experiments when proposed by Zammit. However, when the experiment concluded in the discovery, Bruce tried to discredit Zammit by taking the merit for himself. Information about the role of Zammit was kept low profile or ignored. The fever was renamed after Bruce, as brucellosis. The MFC managed to find cure and ways to eradicate the fever, but had a hard time since there was lack of cooperation with sellers <b>and</b> <b>consumers</b> of milk, some dismissing or ignoring the finding. It was under control by 1938, with the enforcement of standard procedures of pasteurizing milk. However, slaughtering of infected animals continued throughout the 20th century and there was another rising challenge for the department in 1994 and 1995.|$|E
