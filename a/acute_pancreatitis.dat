40|$|The article aims {{to study}} {{the results of the}} complex {{prevention}} of the <b>acute</b> postoperative <b>pancreatitis</b> in the surgical gastroenterology.

Empirical preventing of the <b>acute</b> postoperative <b>pancreatitis</b> was used in the control group. Complex prevention of the <b>acute</b> postoperative <b>pancreatitis</b> in the main group of patients included the use of Dalargin, intravenous infusion of Octreotide, duodenal trypsin enzyme inhibition; intraduodenal reversal of pancreatic secret; intraductal injection of Lidocaine and external transnasal drainage of the pancreatic and biliary ducts. Results. The frequency of <b>acute</b> postoperative <b>pancreatitis</b> was 12. 2 % in the main group. The frequency of <b>acute</b> postoperative <b>pancreatitis</b> was 36. 9 % in the control group. Increased frequency of a mild form of the <b>acute</b> postoperative <b>pancreatitis</b> observed in the main group compared with the control.

5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: <b>acute</b> <b>pancreatitis,</b> cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E

25|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>pancreatitis</b> can {{be further}} divided into mild and severe pancreatitis.

25|$|The {{most common}} causes of <b>acute</b> <b>{{pancreatitis}}</b> are gallstones and heavy alcohol use.

Chronic pancreatitis may develop {{as a result}} of <b>acute</b> <b>pancreatitis.</b> It is most commonly due to many years of heavy alcohol use. Other causes include high levels of blood fats, high blood calcium, some medications, and certain genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis among others. Smoking increases the risk of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. Diagnosis of <b>acute</b> <b>pancreatitis</b> is based on a threefold increase in the blood of either amylase or lipase.

The aim was the assessment of the dynamic of changes of proinflammatory cytokines and white blood cells in time in patients with <b>acute</b> biliary <b>pancreatitis</b> after performed endoscopic sphincterotomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Material and methods: We enrolled 43 consecutive patients with clinically diagnosed mild forms of <b>acute</b> biliary <b>pancreatitis.</b> All were treated by early endoscopic sphincterotomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed during the first 48 hours after admission. The course of the disease was monitored by measurement of the level of proinflammatory cytokines. Results: Marked decrease of the level of proinflammatory interleukins within 24 hours after endoscopic sphincterotomy was observed. Mean values of IL- 6 and IL- 8 were statistically lower immidiately after this procedure (p< 0. 001). Subsequent decrease was achieved after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The mean values of TNF- and IL- 12 p 40 were relatively constant throughout the study period.
