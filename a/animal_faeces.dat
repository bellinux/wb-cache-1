5|$|Most {{grasshoppers}} are polyphagous, eating vegetation {{from multiple}} plant sources, {{but some are}} omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and <b>animal</b> <b>faeces.</b> In general their preference is for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops. The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess cellulase, which by softening plant cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other digestive enzymes.|$|E

5|$|During the wet season, food is {{abundant}} and giraffes are more spread out, while {{during the dry}} season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably {{to make it easier}} to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. It is common for a giraffe to salivate while feeding. The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The <b>animal's</b> <b>faeces</b> come in the form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe drinks at intervals no longer than three days.|$|R
40|$|In many {{circumstances}} it {{is useful}} to know the mean residence time of food substrates within the body following digestion. For instance, such information is crucial to estimate the extent to which dietary components are fermented inside animal stomachs. The mean residence time can be estimated by measuring the rate at which non-absorbable markers, mixed as a supplement into an animals food, are deposited in the <b>animals</b> <b>faeces.</b> The experimental data are analysed with the use of an appropriate mathematical model. We analyse multicompartmental models for the flow of digesta along the gastrointestinal tract of animals. The problem can be treated as a sequence of `tanks 2 ̆ 7 in series. Of interest {{is the fact that the}} volume of the tanks is not necessarily constant. For example, following digestion of food, secretion of pancreatic juices may occur; diluting the tracer. Thus the problem can be treated as a series of semi-batch reactors in series. This problem is a good illustration of the application of the methods of chemical reactor engineering to a situation that, at first sight, does not appear to be a chemical engineering problem...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} test whether mineral {{recommendations}} for horses are likely to guarantee adequate mineral provision for tapirs (Tapirus spp.), we investigated the apparent absorption (aA) of macro- and microminerals in 18 tapirs from 5 zoological institutions {{in a total of}} 24 feeding trials with total faecal collection. Feeds and faeces were analysed for Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Cu, and Zn. The resulting aA coefficients, and the linear relationships of apparently absorbable dietary mineral content to total dietary mineral content (per 100 g dry matter), were compared to data for domestic horses. While there were no apparent differences in the absorption patterns for P, K, Na, K, Fe, Cu or Zn, both Ca and Mg absorption were distinctively higher in tapirs than in horses. Tapirs are browsers that are adaptaed to a diet of higher Ca content and higher Ca:P ratio than equids, and high absorptive efficiency for Ca might have evolved to ensure that high dietary Ca concentrations to not bind dietary P in the intestine and thus make it unavailable for hindgut microbes. Like in other hindgut fermenters, absorption coefficients for Ca increased with dietary Ca:P ratio, and urinary Ca:creatinine ratios increased with dietary Ca. Several zoo diets used were deficient in one or more minerals. When compared to <b>faeces</b> from free-ranging <b>animals,</b> <b>faeces</b> from zoo <b>animals</b> had higher concentrations of most minerals, probably indicating a lesser diluting effect of indgestible fibre in zoo animals...|$|R

50|$|Tapeworm {{eggs are}} {{generally}} ingested through food, water or soil contaminated with human or <b>animal</b> (host) <b>faeces.</b> For example, if a pig is infected with a tapeworm, it may pass eggs or segments (proglottids) {{of the adult}} tapeworm through its faeces into soil. Each segment contains thousands of microscopic tapeworm eggs. These eggs can be ingested via food contaminated with the faeces. Once the eggs have been ingested, they develop into larvae, which can migrate out of the intestines and form cysts in other tissues such as the lungs or liver. This type of infection is not common with beef or fish tapeworms, but can occur with the pork tapeworm — called cysticercosis — and can also occur with dog and sheep tapeworms — called echinococcosis.|$|R

50|$|Examination of the {{contents}} of the gut shows that Hediste diversicolor is a predator and generalist scavenger, able to adapt its diet to whatever is currently available. It spins a mucus net at the entrance of its burrow in which it traps phytoplankton, zooplankton, diatoms, bacteria and other small particles. It creates a water current through its tube by writhing about inside to draw particles through the net. Periodically it rolls the net up and swallows it before spinning another. When the availability of suitably-sized food particles is low it emerges from its burrow and hunts for small invertebrates, seizing them with its strong jaws. It also eats detritus and even <b>animal</b> <b>faeces.</b> They also draw, otherwise not edible, cordgrass seeds into their burrows and let them sprout to produce high-quality food, one of the rare examples of “gardening” by animals.|$|E

40|$|A major {{constraint}} to {{ruminant animal}} {{production in the}} tropics and sub-tropics is the inadequate supply of good quality feeds particularly during the dry season. During such a time, only fibrous crop residues such as maize stover, wheat and rice straws, or low quality grass or hay (H) may be available. These feedstuffs are invariably low in nitrogen (N) and are unable to support normal microbial activity in the rumen. Research {{in the recent past}} therefore had focused much attention on the nutritional potentials of shrub plants since these generally are more tolerant to drier conditions and a number, particularly the legumes, have a high N content. In the current study, the leaves of two shrub legumes, Gliricidia sepium and Calliandra calothyrsus, and the seeds of a non-leguminous shrub plant, Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus), were examined for their nutritional potential as supplements to H in ruminant animal feeding. Of the seven experiments undertaken, three involved the evaluation of Gliricidia leaves, two of Calliandra leaves, one of a mixture of Gliricidia and Calliandra leaves and one of Kenaf seeds. Except for the number of animals used and dietary treatments examined, the materials and methods employed across the seven experiments were the same. The experimental animals were kept in metabolism cages where the feed and water intake and faeces and urine excreted were recorded daily. Samples of feedstuffs offered to the animals, feedstuffs refused by the <b>animals,</b> <b>faeces,</b> urine, rumen fluid and blood were taken and analysed where relevant, for dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), nitrogen (N), urea, ammonia, short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and glucose. Four even groups of a total of 16 wethers were each allocated at random the following four dietary treatments: basal low quality hay (H) fed with fresh Gliricidia leaves either simultaneously or at two hours or at six hours or at 12 hours after H was fed. Experiment 1 was undertaken to examine the effect of time of offering Gliricidia leaves supplement to H after H was fed to sheep, on feed DM digestibility and N utilisation.

40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} genome profile of Chital deer (A. axis) by {{microsatellite}} markers using faecal DNA & to assess its usefulness as non invasive method of genotyping. Materials and Methods: DNA was isolated from 44 <b>animals</b> from <b>faeces</b> and blood, {{out of which}} 26 (3 from blood and 23 from faeces) were subjected for genotyping. The PCR products of all the ten microsatellite loci were subjected to 6 % Urea-PAGE to differentiate allelic size. Result: Total 57 alleles and 49 genotypes were found with their frequencies ranging from 0. 022 to 0. 457 and 0. 043 to 0. 696 respectively. The observed number of alleles ranged from 4 - 8, (Av. = 5. 7 per locus). The PIC and Shannon's information index values for all loci ranged between 0. 6645 to 0. 8270 (Av. = 0. 7442 per locus) and 1. 1870 to 1. 8852 (Av. = 1. 5122 per locus) respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to use modelling and statistical approaches to expand {{our knowledge of the}} immune responses against gastrointestinal nematode infections, {{to assess the impact of}} nematode infection, and to use our improved knowledge to examine novel means of selective breeding in farm animals (sheep) as a control strategy. To expand the knowledge of the host immune response against infection, Chapter 2 of this dissertation focuses on immunoglobulin A (IgA), an antibody that binds nematode molecules, and its transfer through the body from the abomasal mucus (i. e. site of infection, where it is produced) to the blood plasma, where it is typically measured. These findings have been published in Parasitology (Prada Jimenez de Cisneros et al., 2014 a). The implications of low levels of infection in adult milking ewes, which are more resistant than lambs, were also studied. A relationship is generated between infection levels using parasitological data and production data. There were however limitations in the dataset, which are discussed at the end of Chapter 3. Parasite resistance in adults sheep at low levels of infection was also studied, especially since the most common parasitological marker of disease is the faecal egg count (i. e. number of nematode eggs in the <b>animals</b> <b>faeces)</b> which is subject to substantial measurement error, among other limitations. Chapter 4 analyses a dataset of adult animals with low infection levels using a zero inflated binomial model (ZINB) and extends the model by including other evidence of parasite resistance to discriminate between exposed and unexposed animals. To examine selective breeding, an individual-based data-driven immunogenetically explicit mathematical model was developed. One application of this model is to compare the efficacy of two selective breeding schemes, each based on a different marker for disease, namely faecal egg counts and plasma IgA. This work has been published in Journal of the Royal Society Interface (Prada Jimenez de Cisneros et al., 2014 b). The model can be extended to create a distribution for the variation in larval intake that best fits the field data. This allows the partitioning of the variation in adult worm burden into different components. The purpose is to quantify the contribution of the immune response and larval intake to determine which of the two accounts for more of the variation in the level of infection. The model can be also extended to explore selection schemes in the two components of the immune response (i. e. namely the IgA mediated and IgE mediated immune response) and estimate animal size at the end of the grazing season...|$|R
40|$|Weed {{seeds are}} readily {{translocated}} by livestock by attachment to their coat, by consumption or in vehicles used for transporting them. Livestock transport by land, sea and air is increasing worldwide, which together with increasing livestock production, is anticipated to escalate {{the risk of}} weed incursions and displace native flora. There is a particular risk of widespread weed seed dissemination in Australia with its extensive grazing practices and significant amounts of livestock movement. Consumption of weed seeds is largely dependent on grazing management practices, with lax grazing facilitating inflorescence production, the seeds of which may then be consumed if grazing pressure increases.
