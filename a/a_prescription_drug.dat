40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} {{challenges and}} make recommendations for researchers {{in how they}} select evidence to quantitatively assess <b>a</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug's</b> benefits and harms. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: These challenges and recommendations are based on our recent experience conducting a benefit-harm assessment for the <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> roflumilast. We considered the selection of evidence to quantify (1) the drug's treatment effects in patients, (2) the patient population's baseline risks for beneficial and harmful outcomes without treatment, and (3) the patient population's preferences for these beneficial effects and harms. These are fundamental steps for most benefit-harm assessment methods. RESULTS: We identify critical issues in selecting evidence {{for each of these}} steps. We justify in particular the need to incorporate (1) clinical trials for the drug's specific treatment effect; (2) observational studies with the most valid, precise, and applicable effect estimates for the baseline risk; and (3) flexible weighting approaches for balancing the drug benefits and harms. CONCLUSION: We identify challenges and make recommendations for selecting evidence at the critical steps in <b>a</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug's</b> benefit-harm assessment. Our findings should assist other researchers conducting these assessments for <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs,</b> which could help regulators, medical professionals, and patients make better decisions about <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> use...|$|R

25|$|She and McClellan {{turned their}} private video short into a feature-length documentary, Ben's Vortex, {{released}} in 2012.

In support of the latter, which McClellan has stated he believes, the film paints a more negative picture of the McDaniels' lives prior to Ben's disappearance, suggesting that Paul McDaniel's death may not have been a stroke but rather <b>a</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> overdose and that Ben, too, was addicted to the same drugs.|$|E

500|$|Amphetamine (contracted from [...] ) is {{a potent}} central nervous system (CNS) {{stimulant}} that {{is used in the}} treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and obesity. Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers: levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical, the racemic free base, which is equal parts of the two enantiomers, levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine, in their pure amine forms. The term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers, or to either of them alone. Historically, it has been used to treat nasal congestion and depression. Amphetamine is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer, and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant. It is <b>a</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> in many countries, and unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine are often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with recreational use.|$|E
