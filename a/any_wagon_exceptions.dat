50|$|After {{nationalisation}} into British Railways {{under the}} Transport Act 1947 further rationalisation for wagon production took place. Expected future requirement for wagons was also reduced, a 1956 report did not suggest <b>any</b> <b>wagon</b> works closures, but was superseded by another report in 1959, which recommended more closure and rationalisation, including {{the closure of}} the York Wagon Works in 1960. After Richard Beeching became chairman of the British Transport Commission (1961) all workshops came under centralised control from regional control, and a new report was commissioned, which recommended a similar pattern of closure as the 1959 report; York Wagon Works was to close in 1963. The works had closed by 1964.|$|R

50|$|Early wagonways were {{industrial}} railways for transporting goods—initially bulky {{and heavy}} items, particularly mined stone, ores and coal—from {{one point to}} another, most often to a dockside to be loaded onto ships. These early wagonways used a single point-to-point track, and when operators had to move a truck to another wagonway, they did so by hand. The lack of switching technology seriously limited the weight of <b>any</b> loaded <b>wagon</b> combination.|$|R
50|$|The {{first known}} {{ambulance}} reference {{is in the}} City of Ottawa by-laws and was possibly enforced earlier than 1890. It was written that police could use <b>any</b> for hire <b>wagon</b> to “assist in the conveyance of any person to hospital or elsewhere as may be required, who may be wounded or met with accident, or {{who may have been}} suddenly taken ill, provided the sickness is not infectious in nature, and such owner or driver shall be entitled after the performance of such service to the usual fare therefore from the proper authorities” This implies that <b>any</b> taxi, <b>wagon,</b> or cart was used by police to move patients around. This method would have been most effective in the early years since officers patrolled the streets and would have been notified of any traumatic or accidental emergency.|$|R
25|$|Various caster {{types are}} used on scenery wagons. The choice of caster type for <b>any</b> {{particular}} <b>wagon</b> {{depends on a}} number of factors, including platform size and shape, scenery weight, production aesthetics and budget. Typically, casters are mounted so that the bottom of the platform is elevated approximately one-half to three-quarters of an inch above the stage. The number of casters required for a wagon depends on caster type and load rating as well as the size, shape and weight of the wagon and scenery.|$|R
50|$|Long {{after the}} gold rush the region {{remained}} important {{as one of the}} only land routes possible for <b>any</b> <b>wagon</b> road to connect the Pacific Colony with the rest of British North America, and although proposed as the route of an intercolonial wagon road by Governor Douglas such a route was not built until the construction era of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s. As Canada's transportation infrastructure increased the route around the Big Bend became the route of the main interprovincial highway, the section of said route from Revelstoke to Golden becoming known as the Big Bend Highway (opened June 1940). With the routing of the Trans-Canada Highway through the Rogers Pass in 1962, and the construction of Mica and Revelstoke Dams, most of the highway and the former settled area of the Big Bend Country - a few small hamlets and farms, as the area was never heavily populated despite its important early role in the province - is under water, though the name Big Bend Highway remains as a reference to British Columbia Provincial Highway 23. Mica Creek is the only settlement of any size in the region, other than in areas close to Revelstoke and Golden.|$|R
50|$|The May 1915 'Appendix' to the Caledonian Railway Working Timetable {{states of}} the Lylestone Siding that - This Siding will be worked by Up Trains only. It is {{controlled}} by a Staff Key which is kept {{in charge of the}} Signalman at Lissens Siding. When a train which is to work Lylestone Siding arrives at Lissens, it must be stopped at the signal Box, when the Engine will be detached, and the Brakesman in charge will see that the Train is secured by the Van Brake being hard on, and the Front wagons held by Sprags in their wheels. The Brakesman in charge will then get the Staff Key from the signalman, and go forward to Lylestone Siding with the Engine and <b>any</b> <b>Wagons</b> there may be for the Siding, and he will work the points as required. After the work is finished, and Sidings points properly set for the Main Line, the Engine will propel the Wagons taken from Lylestone Siding on the Up Line to Lissens, where they will be run into the Siding by gravitation. The Brakesman will return with the engine to Lissens, and will hand the Staff key back to the Signalman, after which the ordinary working will resume.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1840s many of {{the streets}} laid out by the town fathers {{had yet to be}} opened to traffic. The town council focused much of its {{attention}} on clearing the intended streets of obstacles and opening them to traffic, other street improvements, and the building of wooden sidewalks along major thoroughfares. The council also approved measures for protecting trees in the common areas and streets. Several town ordinances were enacted in 1842 to further restrain the enslaved African American population. These included the prohibition of selling or purchasing any article or commodity from or to a slave without written permission from their master or overseer, no slave was allowed to purchase alcohol without written consent, if any slave were convicted of assault upon [...] "any white man, negro, or mulatto" [...] the owner would be fined $50, any slave caught running [...] "any horse, gelding, or mule" [...] through town would be subject to fifteen lashes unless the owner pays a fine of $1, any slave caught driving <b>any</b> <b>wagon</b> or cart or driving a horse or mule on or across the sidewalks of the town would be subject to 10 lashes, unless the owner pays a fine of 50 cents.|$|R
2500|$|The new styling was {{the work}} of {{designer}} Richard A. Teague, who would go on to design the 1968 Javelin and AMX. Many viewed the newly designed station wagon as the best looking of <b>any</b> American <b>wagon,</b> with its new trim lines, with ample passenger, and cargo room. Led by the top-line 440-series convertible, they were arguably the 1964's most attractive Detroit compacts.

5000|$|Once breached, the {{moderate}} terrain and fertile land between the Appalachians and the Mississippi was rapidly settled.

Overland migrants typically fitted <b>any</b> sturdy <b>wagon</b> with five or six wooden or metal bows that arched high over the bed.

6000|$|There was a short, very black, and {{somewhat}} bowlegged negro {{man on the}} place, named Israel Bonaparte, {{who lived in a}} little cabin by himself, and was noted for his unsocial disposition, and his taciturnity. To him Mr Brandon went one day, and said: [...] "Israel, I want you to go to work on the fence rows on my side of the road to Howlett's. Grub up the bushes, clear out the vines and weeds, and see that the rails and posts are all in order. That will be a job that I expect will last you until the roads begin to get heavy. And, by the way, Israel, while you are at work, I want you to keep a lookout for any visitors that may turn into our road, especially if they happen to be ladies. Now that Miss Rob is away, I am very particular about knowing, beforehand, when ladies are coming to visit me; and when you see <b>any</b> <b>wagon</b> or carriage turn in, I want you to make a short cut across the fields, and let me know it, and I will give you a quarter of a dollar every time you do so." [...] This was a very pleasant job of work for the meditative Israel. He was not very fond of grubbing, but he earned the greater part of his ten dollars a month and rations, by sitting on the fence, smoking a corn-cob pipe, and attending to the second division of the work which his employer had set him to do.|$|R
60|$|There {{never was}} a corps better {{organized}} than was the quartermaster's corps with the Army of the Potomac in 1864. With a wagon-train that would have extended from the Rapidan to Richmond, stretched along in single file and separated as the teams necessarily would be when moving, we could still carry only three days' forage and about ten to twelve days' rations, besides a supply of ammunition. To overcome all difficulties, the chief quartermaster, General Rufus Ingalls, had marked on each wagon the corps badge with the division color {{and the number of}} the brigade. At a glance, the particular brigade to which <b>any</b> <b>wagon</b> belonged could be told. The wagons were also marked to note the contents: if ammunition, whether for artillery or infantry; if forage, whether grain or hay; if rations, whether, bread, pork, beans, rice, sugar, coffee or whatever it might be. Empty wagons were never allowed to follow the army or stay in camp. As soon as a wagon was empty it would return to the base of supply for a load of precisely the same article that had been taken from it. Empty trains were obliged to leave the road free for loaded ones. Arriving near the army they would be parked in fields nearest to the brigades they belonged to. Issues, except of ammunition, were made at night in all cases. By this system the hauling of forage for the supply train was almost wholly dispensed with. They consumed theirs at the depots.|$|R

5000|$|The vast {{majority}} of the California Argonauts (as they were frequently called) were young Anglo men from the United States. Those on the East Coast who could afford the trip usually traveled on paddle steamers and occasionally sailing ships to Panama, Nicaragua or Mexico; they then traveled by land to the Pacific and caught another ship to California. Those who lived in the Mid West usually went by wagon, as many already had a wagon and team and were familiar with wagon travel and often already had or could quickly purchase <b>any</b> additional <b>wagons,</b> animals, supplies and equipment needed for a long wagon trip.(A great many Chinese men came to California, very early in the Gold Rush, having only to cross the Pacific by boat, rather than sail all the way around The Horn or cross the treacherous Isthmus of Panama as many of the Anglo men had to do.) ...|$|R
50|$|Hopper wagons {{can only}} be {{unloaded}} by gravity with no external assistance and are therefore also classed as self-discharging wagons. The majority may be filled, when at rail or road level, by high-level discharge chutes (whose ends are more than 70 cm above {{the top of the}} rails) or conveyor belts. Because a controlled amount of the load can be discharged at <b>any</b> place the <b>wagons</b> may be sent anywhere and are even used individually. Railway companies also use hoppers as departmental wagons in maintenance of way trains for ballasting the track.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the defeat}} at the Battle of Chickamauga the Union Army of the Cumberland {{was trapped in}} Chattanooga, Tennessee, by the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Braxton Bragg. Lacking the {{strength}} to capture the city by direct assault, Bragg settled into a siege, intending to starve the Union forces into surrender or retreat. To do so, he sent the brigade of Evander Law to a point on the Tennessee River downstream from Chattanooga, ordering it to fire on <b>any</b> Union <b>wagon</b> train which passed along the opposite shore. Law spread the 4th and 15th Alabama Infantry regiments along a [...] front, keeping the other three regiments of his brigade in reserve. When the Union army began using other routes to supply Chattanooga, Law's corps commander James Longstreet ordered three regiments to be pulled back to Lookout Mountain, leaving two regiments along the river, with Colonel William C. Oates of the 15th Alabama in command.|$|R
5000|$|For {{most of its}} {{existence}} the daily routine on the branch line was the running of 8 trains per day {{up and down the}} line pulled by steam tank engines. The passenger service usually consisted of two or three carriages and <b>any</b> freight <b>wagons</b> were added to the passenger train. As there was only ever one engine in steam on the line any shunting had to be done either with the passenger carriages attached, as at Culkerton, or, at Kemble and Tetbury, in the short time between scheduled services. Auto-trains were run on the line but not favoured because of the time involved in coupling and decoupling for shunting operations.Engines were initially 0-4-2 side tanks such as the 517 Class and later the 48XX and 58XX Classes. Towards the end the more ubiquitous 0-6-0 pannier tanks such as the 1600 Class predominated and there was the occasional appearance of a 45XX prairie tank.In a further attempt to save costs the last scheduled steam-pulled passenger service ran on 31 January 1959 and on 2 February the passenger service was taken over by diesel railcars (made by AC Cars Ltd with 150 hp AEC engines.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Ford was {{undoubtedly}} the most {{known for the}} use of woodgrain appliques on its vehicles. In addition to the well-known Country Squire, the [...] "Squire" [...] trim level was an available option in a few different model ranges. These include the Falcon Squire, Fairlane Squire, and in the 1970s the Pinto Squire. Surviving examples of these smaller [...] "Squire" [...] wagons are much rarer than the more popular full-size Country Squire, which was ordered and produced in much higher quantities. The Squire was always the highest trim level of <b>any</b> Ford <b>Wagon</b> and included the signature woodgrain applique, and usually additional exterior chrome, nicer interior trim, special emblems, etc. Other manufacturers marketed wagons and minivans with simulated wood from the mid-1950s through the early 1990s. The most notable of these are the Chrysler Town & Country, Buick Estate, Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser, Chevrolet Kingswood Estate, and Mercury Colony Park. The full-sized Jeep Grand Wagoneer also became recognized by its signature wood grained trim. Simulated wood appliqués became less common in the 1980s. With the introduction of the retro-styled Chrysler PT Cruiser wagon-like model, aftermarket firms began selling simulated woodgrain kits.|$|R
