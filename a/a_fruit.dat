5|$|Crickets are hemimetabolic insects, whose {{lifecycle}} {{consists of}} an egg stage, a larval or nymph stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the nymph grows, and an adult stage. The egg hatches into a nymph {{about the size of}} <b>a</b> <b>fruit</b> fly. This passes through about 10 larval stages, and with each successive moult, it becomes more like an adult. After the final moult, the genitalia and wings are fully developed, but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the names}} Thailand contributed {{to the list of}} storm names for Western North Pacific {{tropical}} cylones was 'Durian', which was retired after the second storm of this name in 2006.

A seventeen-year-old juvenile from Badayun, Uttar Pradesh, was arrested at the Anand Vihar terminal in Delhi. The juvenile had only met the others that day.

During the Great Depression, Specter's father was <b>a</b> <b>fruit</b> peddler, a tailor, and a junkyard owner. After graduating from Russell High School, Arlen Specter studied first at the University of Oklahoma. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, majored in international relations, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1951. While at Penn, Specter {{was a member of}} the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity. Specter said the family moved to Philadelphia when his sister Shirley was of a marriageable age because there were no other Jews in Russell.|$|E
5|$|The {{apple tree}} (Malus pumila, {{commonly}} and erroneously called Malus domestica) is a deciduous {{tree in the}} rose family {{best known for its}} sweet, pomaceous fruit, the apple. It is cultivated worldwide as <b>a</b> <b>fruit</b> tree, and is the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.|$|E

5|$|The {{puzzle of}} how {{embryonic}} development was controlled {{began to be}} solved using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. The step-by-step control of its embryogenesis was visualized by attaching fluorescent dyes of different colours to specific types of protein made by genes expressed in the embryo. A dye such as green fluorescent protein, originally from a jellyfish, was typically attached to an antibody specific to <b>a</b> <b>fruit</b> fly protein, forming a precise indicator of where and when that protein appeared in the living embryo.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many more}} {{invertebrates}} than vertebrates {{are used in}} animal testing, these studies are largely unregulated by law. The most frequently used invertebrate species are Drosophila melanogaster, <b>a</b> <b>fruit</b> fly, and Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. In the case of C. elegans, the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known, while studies in the fly D. melanogaster can use an amazing array of genetic tools. These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in animal testing, including their short life cycle and {{the ease with which}} large numbers may be housed and studied. However, the lack of an adaptive immune system and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in several aspects of medical research such as vaccine development. Similarly, the fruit fly immune system differs greatly from that of humans, and diseases in insects can be different from diseases in vertebrates; however, fruit flies and waxworms can be useful in studies to identify novel virulence factors or pharmacologically active compounds.|$|E
5|$|At {{the climax}} of the film, to Tommy's horror the tree finally dies just before arrival, as Izzy had also died just before a cure. A final {{apparition}} of Izzi appears, comforting Tommy in the face of his accepted impending death and suggesting that they may share an afterlife now. He finally understands and embraces his death, moments before the star goes supernova, engulfing the ship and everything within. The traveler's body is absorbed, but the tree flourishes back to life being engulfed by the star dying inside the nebula. Izzi's apparition picks <b>a</b> <b>fruit</b> from the new tree of life and hands it to Tom, the present-day neuroscientist, who plants it in Izzi's grave.|$|E
