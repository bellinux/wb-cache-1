Udal law {{formed the basis}} of the legal system and it is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland measure. Althings were open-air governmental assemblies that met {{in the presence of the}} jarl and the meetings were open to virtually <b>all</b> <b>free</b> men. At these sessions decisions were made, laws passed and complaints adjudicated. Examples include Tingwall and Law Ting Holm in Shetland, Dingwall in Easter Ross, and Tynwald on the Isle of Man.|$|E
5|$|The {{fine for}} {{neglecting}} fyrd, {{the obligation to}} do military service for the king, is set at 120 shillings for a nobleman, and 30 shillings for a ceorl, incidentally revealing that ceorls were required {{to serve in the}} army. Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but {{it is not surprising that}} <b>all</b> <b>free</b> men would fight, since defeat might have meant slavery.|$|E
5|$|Turmoil {{marked the}} {{legislative}} sessions of Brown's term; his supporters had been either {{unwilling or unable}} to influence the rest of the Democratic slate, and tensions over the currency issue soon split the administration. Attorney General William Jackson Hendricks, Treasurer Henry S. Hale, and Auditor Luke C. Norman were <b>all</b> <b>free</b> silver supporters and feuded with Brown and his (appointed) secretary of state, John W. Headley, throughout Brown's term. Over time, the rift deepened and spread to the entire Democratic party. Brown also frequently clashed with the legislature and vetoed several of the bills it passed; none of his vetoes were ever overridden.|$|E

5|$|English {{taxation}} {{after the}} Norman Conquest of 1066 {{was based on}} the geld or danegeld, a national tax paid by <b>all</b> <b>free</b> men, those who were not serfs or slaves. The geld {{was based on the}} number of hides of land owned by the taxpayer, and could be demanded by the king and assessed at varying levels without the need for consultation with the barons or other subjects. During King Henry I's reign, an increasing number of exemptions, and the difficulties encountered in collecting the geld, lowered its importance to the Exchequer—the treasury of England. It is unclear whether the geld was collected at all during the reign of Henry's successor, King Stephen. Stephen's successor, King Henry II, collected the geld only twice, once in 1155 and again in 1161–1162. The geld was unpopular, and after 1162 Henry may have felt it politically expedient to stop collecting it.|$|E
5|$|In the West, law {{had been}} {{administered}} on a highly localized or tribal basis, and {{private property rights}} {{may have been a}} novelty of the Roman era, particularly among Celtic peoples. Roman law facilitated the acquisition of wealth by a pro-Roman elite who found their new privileges as citizens to be advantageous. The extension of universal citizenship to <b>all</b> <b>free</b> inhabitants of the Empire in 212 required the uniform application of Roman law, replacing the local law codes that had applied to non-citizens. Diocletian's efforts to stabilize the Empire after the Crisis of the Third Century included two major compilations of law in four years, the Codex Gregorianus and the Codex Hermogenianus, to guide provincial administrators in setting consistent legal standards.|$|E
5|$|Present-day {{knowledge}} {{of the nature of}} Scots law before the eleventh century is largely speculative, with no surviving law codes from Scotland in this period, but it was probably a mixture of different legal traditions representing the different cultures inhabiting the land at the time, including British, Irish and Anglo-Saxon customs. The legal tract known as Laws of the Brets and Scots, probably compiled in the reign of David I, set out a system of compensation for injury and death based on ranks and the solidarity of kin groups. There were popular courts, the comhdhail, indicated by dozens of place names throughout eastern Scotland. In Scandinavian-held areas Udal law formed the basis of the legal system and it is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland measure. Althings were open-air governmental assemblies that met {{in the presence of the}} jarl, and the meetings were open to virtually <b>all</b> <b>free</b> men.

5|$|The oldest {{portion of}} the BGSU campus {{is located in the}} {{southwest}} corner. It contains the oldest buildings on campus and was the original location. This area offers green space with large trees and historic buildings built in the early 1900s. Administrative services and classrooms occupy these buildings. Although not part of the historic section, Founders Hall, a large dorm, is located on the Southwest corner. Hanna Hall houses The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Film Theater and Gallery. Dedicated to BGSU in 1976, it features early film memorabilia and highlights the careers of both Lillian Gish and Dorothy Gish. The theater was renovated and rededicated in 1990. It seats 168 and is home to Tuesdays at the Gish, an International Film Series, and a Sunday Matinee Series, which are <b>all</b> <b>free</b> and open to the community.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{conquest of}} Wales began in AD 48 and took 30 years to complete. Roman rule lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest {{are the most}} widely known feature of Wales during the Roman era, because of the spirited, but {{ultimately}} unsuccessful, defence of their homelands by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices. Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales, east of the Gower Peninsula, {{where there is a}} legacy of Romanisation. The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent, is in south east Wales. Both Caerwent and Carmarthen, also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates. Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold, copper and lead, as well as modest amounts of some other metals such as zinc and silver. Roman economic development was concentrated in south-eastern Britain, and no significant industries located in Wales. This was largely a matter of circumstance, as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Although Latin became the official language of Wales, the people tended to continue to speak in Brythonic. While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes of Wales began to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to <b>all</b> <b>free</b> men throughout the Empire. Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity, which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4thcentury, as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313.|$|E

In contrast, no choice is needed to prove that free modules are flat, so theorems about flat modules can still apply.|$|E
