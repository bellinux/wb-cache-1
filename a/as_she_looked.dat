From an early age she aspired to become an artist and after private training she went to study in Paris where Krøyer began to court her. It is believed Marie was subsequently reluctant to paint <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up to Krøyer as a far more accomplished artist. A few of her works have nevertheless survived.|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{criticized the}} {{character}} development of Lori Grimes. Goldman was angry upon viewing the crash sequence, avouching that it stunted any development {{intended for the}} scene. He stated, [...] "The Walking Dead really needs to work on strengthening its female characters, and it doesn't help when Lori has a major accident for such a stupid reason, getting distracted <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at a map while she drove. Yeah, yeah, there was a zombie in the road, {{but it could have}} been an animal [...] just as easily, and it really undercut the intended drama of her situation when it just seems so stupid that it happened at all." [...] Halden thought that the foundation set up for furthering storyline progression was contrived, while Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal said that the premise of the dilemma made no sense. Jeffery was much more optimistic about the scene, ultimately evaluating it as a [...] "jaw-dropping moment".|$|E
500|$|Appearing for {{the first}} time in Star Trek was J.C. Brandy as Marta Batanides. She was nervous and intimidated to work with Patrick Stewart, but said that {{everyone}} on the cast and crew made her feel welcome. However, there were concerns when she first arrived on set for costume fitting <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> quite young, and Stewart was worried about the age difference on screen. Director Les Landau requested that the hair and make-up on Brandy should make her look older. Brandy said that this [...] "worked nicely", but they still [...] "downplayed the sex". She was pleased with her scenes with Stewart, as they managed to capture a [...] "nervousness and innocence" [...] in Picard and Marta's relationship. The episode marked the first appearance of the Nausicaans on screen with Clint Carmichael playing the lead alien, although they had been mentioned earlier in the episode [...] "Samaritan Snare". The two non-speaking members of the race were portrayed by stuntmen Tom Morta and Dick Dimitri. The two appeared on screen without make-up in the episodes [...] "A Fistful of Datas" [...] and [...] "," [...] respectively.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, Lloyd travelled to New York {{where she}} re-appeared at Koster and Bial's Music Hall. Her first song {{was about a}} young woman who lacked confidence in finding a suitor. The chorus, [...] "Not for the very best man that ever got into a pair of trousers", proved hilarious; The Era observed that the line [...] "tickled the audience immensely". Following this, she performed a song about a French maid who appeared innocent and petite at first sight, but {{turned out not to be}} so. The Era described the character as being [...] "not so demure <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked,</b> for she confided to her auditors that she 'knew a lot about those tricky little things they don't teach a girl at school'." [...] Many other songs followed and were all warmly received. [...] At the conclusion of each performance, she received gifts from the audience including bouquets and floral structures. [...] The Era commented that [...] "Miss Lloyd's clever character work, her versatility and unflagging endeavours to please were rewarded with deserved success". [...] After the tour, Lloyd returned to London, and moved to Hampstead with Hurley. That Christmas, she appeared in pantomime, this time at the Crown Theatre in Peckham in a production of Dick Whittington in which she played the title role. In it, she sang [...] "A Little Bit Off the Top", which MacQueen-Pope describes as being [...] "one of the pantomime songs of the year". The Music Hall and Theatre Review was equally complimentary, saying: [...] "Brilliant Repertory, Charming Dresses, A Unique Personality!" [...] During the Christmas period of 1898–9, Lloyd returned to the Crown where she took her benefit, during which she appeared in Dick Whittington. [...] The entertainment culminated with a song from Vesta Victoria, and a short piece called The Squeaker, starring Joe Elvin.|$|E

In Hecht's poem she [...] "caught the bitter allusion to the sea", imagined [...] "what his whiskers would feel like / On {{the back of her}} neck", and felt sad <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> out across the channel. [...] "And then she got really angry" [...] at the thought that she had become [...] "a sort of mournful cosmic last resort". After which she says [...] "one or two unprintable things".|$|E
2500|$|Her {{most famous}} poem, [...] "Solitude", was first {{published}} in the February 25, 1883 (?) issue of The New York Sun. The inspiration for the poem came as she was travelling to attend the Governor's inaugural ball in Madison, Wisconsin. On her way to the celebration, there was a young woman dressed in black sitting across the aisle from her. The woman was crying. Miss Wheeler sat next to her and sought to comfort her {{for the rest of the}} journey. When they arrived, the poet was so depressed that she could barely attend the scheduled festivities. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at her own radiant face in the mirror, she suddenly recalled the sorrowful widow. It was at that moment that she wrote the opening lines of [...] "Solitude": ...|$|E

2500|$|Oilill died like {{a prince}} it was reported. [...] His head {{was cut off}} by a triumphant Fergus and was impaled on a lance and {{brought back to the}} fort at Rathmorgan to prove to Flidhais that she was now a free woman. [...] Fergus {{presented}} her husband's severed head as a courtship present to Flidhais. [...] However, Flidhais was overcome with guilt <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> in Oilill's unblinking all-knowing eyes and she was horrified at {{what had happened to her}} husband. [...] She burst into tears and demanded his body be brought back to their fort. The troops retrieved Oilill's body and when Flidhais looked at his body, gashed all over and covered in blood, she was again filled with such remorse she began to recount his every worthy action during his lifetime. [...] Tradition maintains that Oilill is buried just north of Inver in a tumulus which is marked on today's maps as a 'mound'.|$|E
2500|$|Film {{historian}} Jeffrey Vance {{said that}} Garbo communicated her characters' innermost feelings through her movement, gestures, and most importantly, her eyes. With the slightest movement of them, he argues, she subtly conveyed complex attitudes and feelings toward other characters {{and the truth}} of the situation. [...] "She doesn't act," [...] said Camille co-star Rex O’Malley; [...] "she lives her roles." [...] Director Clarence Brown, who made seven of Garbo's pictures, told an interviewer [...] "Garbo has something behind the eyes that you couldn't see until you photographed it in close-up. You could see thought. If she had to look at one person with jealousy, and another with love, she didn't have to change her expression. You could see it in her eyes <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> from one to the other. And nobody else has {{been able to do that}} on screen." [...] Director George Sidney adds [...] "You could call it underplaying but in underplaying she overplayed everyone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there was}} also some {{negative}} reception of the character, described by Matt Slagle of Associated Press as [...] "outrageously proportioned". In a review of Emergence, Computer Gaming World criticized the [...] "cringe-inducing scenes [...] villainous sexpot Elexis Sinclaire's digitized boobs practically slapping you in the face." [...] Phaedra Boinodiris from WomenGamers.com, talking to GamesRadar in 2007, used Elexis {{as an example of}} game characters [...] "sexualized to the point of deformity" [...] <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> [...] "like she crawled out of an S club." [...] In 2011, Wirtualna Polska ranked Elexis from the original SiN as the sixth [...] "most unrealistic and sexist depiction of women in games". In 2012, Shelby Reiches of Cheat Code Central included [...] "Elexis' Hidden Button" [...] scene among the four worst cinematic scenes in games, commenting that [...] "the player's final confrontation with villain Elexis Sinclaire, already dolled up to look like a stereotypical sex worker, involves her 'out-smarting' the player by evoking Basic Instincts Sharon Stone. Elexis, however, lacks her inspiration's sophistication," [...] and calling it not as much as provocative but rather [...] "awkward and nonsensical".|$|E

2500|$|... "Orinoco Flow" [...] was {{the final}} track written for the album, {{but it was one}} that Enya {{recalled}} was difficult to work on, which involved several breaks from recording before coming back to it several weeks after. She later pointed out the absence of deadlines to complete the album, as granted in her contract with Warner, which allowed the song to be developed {{over a period of time}} until [...] "we were able at the end to listen to it and say 'this is good'". It originated from a riff she had developed after Nicky suggested to play a melody in five different octaves; they left the arrangement as it was, until they realised the album needed one more track. The song developed around the initial riff, itself becoming part of the chorus hook. An earlier version of the song contained no middle eight and had the line [...] "Sail away..." [...] after every line which Dickens later said, [...] "drove me crazy", but recognised its potential if it was worked on. Its pizzicato introduction, which has been compared to Andy Williams' 1963 single [...] "Can't Get Used to Losing You", was the genesis of Roma's inspiration for the song's lyrics after she had heard the introduction <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> out of the studio window and saw her children skipping. Dickins and Cullum are referenced in the lyrics in the lines: [...] "We can steer, we can near with Rob Dickins at the wheel. We can sigh, say goodbye, Ross and his dependencies", the latter being a reference to the region of Antarctica known as Ross Dependency. Dickins only found out about it after the album had been pressed which embarrassed him at first and initially wanted it changed, but soon warmed to it after the single went to number one. [...] "All these years later", he said, [...] "if I hear that line ... I can't help smiling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rachael Blampied had auditioned 5 {{times for}} Shortland Street, with her last being {{for the role}} of Zlata Waldheim. However Blampied was turned down every time <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> too similar to one of the core actresses, Beth Allen (who portrayed Brooke Freeman). After she auditioned {{for the role of}} Zlata, {{producers}} decided to utilise their similarities and create the role of Bree – a sister for Brooke, specifically for her. Blampied received a call in mid-2011 asking if she was eager to accept the role. She was extremely pleased with the call, saying; [...] "It's the best phone call an actor can wish for – that they're writing a part for you on a show {{you really want to be}} on. It was a complete surprise and totally out of the blue." [...] The character was originally planned to appear nicer but end up being [...] "badder" [...] than Brooke. Blampied started filming her scenes in October 2011. Blampied found her first day of work similar to walking [...] "into a beast" [...] and although she was nervous, she found it was like [...] "a family". In November TVNZ announced that a new addition would be arriving to Brooke's dysfunctional family, with Bree arriving on 9 December. Blampied enjoyed working alongside her screen sister, Allen and Pua Magasiva (who portrayed Brooke's boyfriend Vinnie), saying; [...] "I've had some great scenes with Beth and Pua, which have been enormous fun as they're such generous actors and are heaps of fun to hang out with!" [...] The character was originally envisioned to be killed off at the end of her stint, but producers were so impressed with Blampied that they rewrote the characters ending by sending her to a psychiatric hospital. Blampied was not aware as to what Bree was to endure throughout her stint but was informed that she was always going to leave after her initial storyline came to an end. She was sad to leave the soap but pleased with her exit, [...] "I was sad to have to leave the show, but it's not a closed exit. One of the writers said to me on my last day, 'Well it's always good to have a crazy in the cupboard.'" [...] Bree made her last appearance on 25 September 2012.|$|E
2500|$|One Ojibwa {{woman from}} the far western end of Lake Superior, Oshahgushkodanaqua, who married in 1793 John Johnston, a British fur trader based in Sault St. Marie working for the North West Company, later gave an account in her old age of how she came {{to be married to}} a British writer named Anna Brownell Jameson. According to Jameson's 1838 book Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada, Oshahgushkodanaqua told her when she was 13, she {{embarked}} on her [...] "vision quest" [...] to find her guardian spirit by fasting alone in a lodge painted black on a high hill. During Oshahgushkodanaqua's [...] "vision quest": [...] "She dreamed continually of a white man, who approached her with a cup in his hand, saying [...] "Poor thing! Why are you punishing yourself? Why do you fast? Here is food for you!" [...] He was always accompanied by a dog, who looked up at her like he knew her. Also, she dreamed of being on a high hill, which was surrounded by water, and from which she beheld many canoes full of Indians, coming to her and paying her homage; after this, {{she felt as if she}} was being carried up into the heavens, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> down on the earth, she perceived it was on fire and said to herself, [...] "All my relations will be burned!", but a voice answered and said, [...] "No, they will not be destroyed, they will be saved!", and she knew it was a spirit, because the voice was not human. She fasted for ten days, during which time her grandmother brought her at intervals some water. When satisfied that she had obtained a guardian spirit in the white stranger who haunted her dreams, she returned to her father's lodge". About five years later, Oshahgushkodanaqua first met Johnston, who asked to marry her, but was refused permission by her father who did not think he wanted a long-term relationship. When Johnston returned the next year and again asked to marry Oshahgushkodanaqua, her father granted permission, but she herself declined, saying she disliked the implications of being married until death, but ultimately married under strong pressure from her father. Oshahgushkodanaqua came to embrace her marriage when she decided that Johnston was the white stranger she saw in her dreams during her vision quest. The couple stayed married for 36 years with the marriage ending with Johnston's death, and Oshahgushkodanaqua played an important role in her husband's business career. Jameson also noted Oshahgushkodanaqua was considered to be a strong woman among the Ojibwa, writing [...] "in her youth she hunted and was accounted the surest eye and fleetest foot among the women of her tribe".|$|E
