It {{examines}} their students' perceptions of <b>BE</b> <b>teachers</b> from various countries {{who did not}} speak students' first language (L 1). This study addresses four areas of importance to the perceptions of BE teacheers: (a) Thai university students' perceptions of <b>BE</b> <b>teachers</b> {{from the beginning to}} the end of the course; (b) BE teachers' perceptions of themselves from the beginning {{to the end of the}} course; (c) BE teachers' and students' variables related to their perceptions of BE teachers; and (d) students' perceptions and their teachers' perceptions of <b>BE</b> <b>teachers.</b> This study employs quantitative and qualitative research methods: pre- and post-course surveys and interviews. The surveys were distributed to eight <b>BE</b> <b>teachers</b> and their 57 students at the beginning and the end of the eight-week courses. The results of pre- and post-course surveys were compared to examine how their perceptions of <b>BE</b> <b>teachers</b> may have changed. After the post-course survey, interviews to randomly selected students taught by different <b>BE</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> conducted to further examine their perceptions. The results showed that both <b>BE</b> <b>teachers</b> and students had positive images of <b>BE</b> <b>teachers.</b> Moreover, not many variables were found in both groups of <b>BE</b> <b>teachers</b> and their students. However, one variable for each group stood out: experienced and inexperienced teachers, and students enrolled in different language skills courses. There were similarities found between teachers' perceptions and students' perceptions of <b>BE</b> <b>teachers...</b>|$|R

25|$|Coincidentally Anytus appears, whom Socrates praises {{as the son}} of Anthemion, {{who earned}} his fortune with {{intelligence}} and hard work. He says that Anthemion had his son well-educated and so Anytus is well-suited to join the investigation. Socrates suggests that the sophists <b>are</b> <b>teachers</b> of virtue. Anytus is horrified, saying that he neither knows any, nor cares to know any. Socrates then questions why it is that men do not always produce sons of the same virtue as themselves. He alludes to other notable male figures, such as Themistocles, Aristides, Pericles and Thucydides, and casts doubt on whether these men produced sons as capable of virtue as themselves. Anytus becomes offended and accuses Socrates of slander, warning him to be careful expressing such opinions. (The historical Anytus was one of Socrates' accusers in his trial.) Socrates suggests that Anytus does not realize what slander is, and continues his dialogue with Meno as to the definition of virtue.|$|E

Not all Latino ladies are 'cholas' in the barrio, some of them <b>are</b> <b>teachers,</b> writers, engineers and nurses and doctors." [...] Radio stations in Malaysia chose to censor the part of the lyrics dealing with the acceptance of the LGBT community, due to censorship in the country of content that may be deemed offensive. In response, Gaga urged her Malaysian fans, who wanted the uncensored version to be played, to take action by stating: [...] "It is your job and it is your duty as young people to have your voices heard. You must do everything that you can if you want to be liberated by your society. You must call, you must not stop, you must protest peaceably." ...|$|E

2500|$|Having {{temporary}} undivided supportive {{attention from}} another person often {{gives rise to}} strong feelings, apparently towards that person, typically of [...] "falling in love" [...] with them.

The organisations differ in the ways that they handle this. [...] The inability to trust and feel in real relationships is often exacerbated by the pseudo-intimacy of co-counseling, making transference more likely and more dangerous.|$|E

He points out the similarities and differences between [...] "true belief" [...] and [...] "knowledge". True beliefs are as useful to us as knowledge, but they often fail to [...] "stay in their place" [...] and must be [...] "tethered" [...] by what he calls aitias logismos (the calculation of reason, or reasoned explanation), immediately adding that this is anamnesis, or recollection.|$|E

It seems a mechanical advantage, and great benefit it is to each speaker, as he can now paint out his thought to himself. We pass very fast, in our personal moods, from dignity to dependence. And if any appear never to assume the chair, but always to stand and serve, it is because we do not see the company in a sufficiently long period for the whole rotation of parts to come about. As to what we call the masses, and common men;--there are no common men. All men are at last of a size; and true art is only possible, on the conviction that every talent has its apotheosis somewhere. Fair play, and an open field, and freshest laurels to all who have won them! But heaven reserves an equal scope for every creature. Each is uneasy until he has produced his private ray unto the concave sphere, and beheld his talent also in its last nobility and exaltation.|$|E

This sense of support and restfulness and clinging was fresh and delightful to her. It is a woman's ancestral part to look up to the man; she is happiest in doing it, and must long remain so; and Herminia was not sorry to find herself in this so much a woman. She thought it delicious to roam through the long halls of some great gallery with Alan, and let him point out to her the pictures he loved best, explain their peculiar merits, and show the subtle relation in which they stood to the pictures that went before them and the pictures that came after them, as well as to the other work of the same master or his contemporaries. It was even no small joy to her to find that he knew so much more about art and its message than she did; that she could look up to his judgment, confide in his opinion, see the truth of his criticism, profit much by his instruction. So well did she use those seven short days, indeed, that she came to Florence with Fra Angelico, Filippo Lippi, Botticelli, mere names; and she went away from it feeling that she had made them real friends and possessions for a life-time.|$|E
