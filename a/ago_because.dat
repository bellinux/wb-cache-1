5|$|The current Laplace {{resonance}} {{is unable}} to pump the orbital eccentricity of Ganymede to a higher value. The value of about 0.0013 is probably a remnant from a previous epoch, when such pumping was possible. The Ganymedian orbital eccentricity is somewhat puzzling; {{if it is not}} pumped now it should have decayed long ago due to the tidal dissipation in the interior of Ganymede. This means that the last episode of the eccentricity excitation happened only several hundred million years <b>ago.</b> <b>Because</b> Ganymede's orbital eccentricity is relatively low—on average 0.0015—tidal heating is negligible now. However, in the past Ganymede may have passed through one or more Laplace-like resonances that were able to pump the orbital eccentricity to a value as high as 0.01–0.02. This probably caused a significant tidal heating of the interior of Ganymede; the formation of the grooved terrain may be a result of one or more heating episodes.|$|E
25|$|The {{island of}} Tasmania {{was home to}} the thylacine, a {{marsupial}} which resembled a wild dog. Known colloquially as the Tasmanian tiger for the distinctive striping across its back, it became extinct in mainland Australia about 4,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>because</b> of competition by the introduced dingo. Owing to persecution by farmers, government-funded bounty hunters and, in the final years, collectors for overseas museums, {{it appears to have}} been exterminated in Tasmania.|$|E
25|$|The Wykagyl {{course is}} hilly, tree-lined and very {{beautiful}} accented by its stone tees. It is old fashioned, primarily because the three architects who were mainly {{responsible for the}} layout of the course - Lawrence Van Enen, Donald Ross and A. W. Tillinghast - all practiced their art over 60 years <b>ago.</b> <b>Because</b> of this it has small greens and more blind shots than any architect could get away with designing today.|$|E

25|$|DNA {{evidence}} suggests the bonobo and common chimpanzee species effectively separated {{from each other}} fewer than one million years ago. The Pan line split from the last common ancestor shared with humans approximately six to seven million years <b>ago.</b> <b>Because</b> no species other than Homo sapiens has survived from the human line of that branching, both Pan species are the closest living relatives of humans and cladistically are equally close to humans. The recent genome data confirms the genetic equidistance.|$|E
25|$|The Maxakalisaurus fossils {{belonged to}} an animal about 13meters (43.3ft) long, with an {{estimated}} weight of 9tons, although, according to paleontologist Alexander Kellner, it could reach a length of approximately 20meters (65ft). It had a long neck and tail, ridged teeth (unusual among sauropods) and lived about 80million years <b>ago.</b> <b>Because</b> sauropods seem to have lacked significant competition in South America, they evolved there with greater diversity and more unusual traits than elsewhere in the world. A replica has been displayed at the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro, since August 28, 2006.|$|E
25|$|Humans, {{comprising}} the genus Homo, appeared between 1.5 and 2.5 million years ago, {{a time that}} roughly coincides with {{the start of the}} Pleistocene 2.6 million years <b>ago.</b> <b>Because</b> the Pleistocene ended a mere 12,000 years ago, most human adaptations either newly evolved during the Pleistocene, or were maintained by stabilizing selection during the Pleistocene. Evolutionary psychology therefore proposes that the majority of human psychological mechanisms are adapted to reproductive problems frequently encountered in Pleistocene environments. In broad terms, these problems include those of growth, development, differentiation, maintenance, mating, parenting, and social relationships.|$|E

25|$|The {{prehistory}} of Greenland is a {{story of}} repeated waves of Paleo-Eskimo immigration from the islands north of the North American mainland. (The peoples of those islands are thought to have descended, in turn, from inhabitants of Siberia who migrated into Canada thousands of years <b>ago.)</b> <b>Because</b> of Greenland's remoteness and climate, survival there was difficult. Over the course of centuries, one culture succeeded another as groups died out and were replaced by new immigrants. Archaeology can give only approximate dates for the cultures that flourished before the Norse exploration of Greenland in the 10th century.|$|E

25|$|There are 24 Muduvan and Paliyan {{families}} living there. They {{were said to}} have migrated from Manjampatti 200 years <b>ago</b> <b>because</b> of their fear of herds of wild elephants. They originally lived in caves. They eat wild roots, maize, fruits from wild plants, honey and bamboo rice. Their limited income comes from selling bamboo products and lemon grass oil, which they spend to buy rice from other villages. These people are nature worshippers. They do not worship regularly or have a particular place of worship but have a sacred area in their village. They visit this area to celebrate the harvest festival Pongal and the rain (Mari) festival, during which they sacrifice a goat.|$|E
25|$|Bothriolepis fossils {{are found}} in Middle and Late Devonian strata (from 387 to 360 million years <b>ago).</b> <b>Because</b> the fossils {{are found in}} {{freshwater}} sediments, Bothriolepis is presumed to have spent most of its life in freshwater rivers and lakes, but was probably able to enter salt water as well, because its range appeared to have corresponded with the Devonian continental coastlines. Many paleontologists hypothesize that they were anadromous, that is, they lived {{most of their lives}} in saltwater, and returned to freshwater only to breed, similar to salmon. Large groupings of Bothriolepis specimens have been found in Asia, Europe, Australia (Gogo Formation), Pennsylvania (Catskill Formation), Quebec (Escuminac Formation), Virginia (Chemung), Colorado, Cuche Formation (Boyacá, Colombia), and all around the world.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that each year about 17,000 children die from diarrhea. One reason is that drinking water quality is often below standards. Some water treatment plants are not maintained properly and are thus inefficient in removing parasites, viruses and other parasitic microorganisms. In 2009, {{a study by the}} Ministry of Health showed that drinking water for half a million people in Asiut was unfit for human consumption. As of June 2011, nothing had been done to address the problem. Chlorination systems of wells, which had been installed years <b>ago</b> <b>because</b> high levels of bacteria had been detected in the groundwater, failed for lack of maintenance and have been shut down so that untreated water is provided to the residents.|$|E

25|$|Within the Columbia Basin, {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} the Missoula floods' glaciofluvial deposits, informally known as the Hanford formation, has documented the presence of Middle and Early Pleistocene Missoula flood deposits within the Othello Channels, Columbia River Gorge, Channeled Scabland, Quincy Basin, Pasco Basin, and the Walla Walla Valley.

25|$|The San Juan Islands {{host the}} {{greatest}} concentration of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) in the contiguous United States. Great blue herons (Ardea herodias), black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachman), and numerous shorebirds are found {{along the shore}} and in winter, the islands are home to trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator), Canada goose (Branta canadensis) and other waterfowl. Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), northern harriers (Circus cyaneus), barred owls (Strix varia) and other birds of prey are found. In addition diving birds such as rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata), pigeon guillemots (Cepphus columba) and endangered marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) frequent the surrounding seas. Western bluebirds (Sialia mexicana), which were eliminated from the islands 50 years <b>ago</b> <b>because</b> of competition for nesting sites by non-native European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), were recently restored to San Juan Island thanks {{to the efforts of}} volunteers and conservation organizations.|$|E
