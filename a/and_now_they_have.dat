500|$|The {{committee}} professes {{to find me}} {{very useful}} in unravelling the conundrums sent down by the finance committee... The last two nights I have found the drafting committee fagged [...] and despairing, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> pitched the conundrums at me and gone out for a smoke; and then I worked out algebraic formulas to clear the thing up, drafted clauses accordingly, and when the committee returned we had plain sailing.|$|E
2500|$|About climate change, Jensen said in December 2008 that [...] "we can {{see that}} climate changes are {{happening}}, {{but they have been}} happening {{for as long as the}} world has existed. The question is whether they are man-made or not, or whether they are dangerous or not. Just some 30 years ago, all these scientists said that the world was getting colder, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> changed their mind and say that the world is getting warmer. So is that what's happening, or isn't it?" [...] Regardless, she is largely supportive of expanding and researching into renewable energy production. In January 2010 she attacked the IPCC, accusing the report from the panel of being based on fraudulent data. She referred to the erroneous statement of Himalayan glaciers melting by 2035, ice melting predictions by Al Gore and Jonas Gahr Støre, questions of statistical sampling, and emails from climate scientists at the Climatic Research Unit.|$|E
60|$|And they beheld her, {{and loved}} her, and obeyed her, each {{according}} to his powers: <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> their reward.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> gone {{three miles}} and more, {{and came to}} Sir John's lodge-gates.|$|R
60|$|They ran as {{the wind}} runs, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> were in the wood, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> found the beasts.|$|R
60|$|When Nat got up he was {{thoroughly}} angry. He had hired the roughs {{to help him}} <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> deserted the cause. He glared at Dave.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{began at}} Staleybridge," [...] said Devilsdust, [...] "and they have stopped them all; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> marched into Manchester ten {{thousand}} strong. They pelted the police--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, this is {{the worst}} yet," [...] growled Ike Akley, when he and his cronies were left alone. [...] "We {{thought we were going to}} have the best of it <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> turned the tables on us." ...|$|E
6000|$|Silas groaned aloud. [...] "It took me {{ten years}} to build, bit by bit, almost stone by stone, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{destroyed}} it. Well, why not? God's will be done. Give me your arm, love; I {{want to get to}} the water. I feel faint and sick." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{come to the}} {{fountain}} of Enrogel, and having dismounted from their steeds, stood clustering about the low wall which surrounds the little pool of water.|$|R
5000|$|It {{reset the}} {{love affair with}} that team. People had become jaded, people had become upset {{with the idea that}} they just didn't see the success {{at the end of the}} rainbow. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> this, <b>and</b> this {{reminded}} them of how special this football team really is.|$|R
60|$|The {{boys were}} highly elated over the find, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> the bonds <b>they</b> {{concluded}} that a further search for Sid Merrick could wait. They did not care whether Tad Sobber was captured or not, as they did not think the bully was much of a criminal.|$|R
6000|$|Norman {{followed}} his father {{down a steep}} narrow lane, little better than a stony water-course, and began to repeat, [...] "If you would but let me do my work! I've got nothing else to do, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> put me up, I should not like not to keep my place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is a trick--a plot,' cried Aubrey passionately; 'I know it is! He {{always said}} he would run away if they tried to teach him dishonesty; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> done this and driven him away, and laid the blame on him. Ethel, why don't {{you say you are}} sure of it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nonsense!' exclaimed Gilbert, disrespectfully indeed, {{but from}} the bottom of his heart, and {{breaking}} at once into a flood of tears. 'You are the only creature that has been kind to me since I lost my mother and Ned, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been and turned you against me too;' and he sobbed violently.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a {{trial of}} skill, for as they killed as many as they {{knew what to do}} with, and had their choice of beef, if they killed a bull they let him lie, as having no use for him, but chose the cows, as what they thought was only fit for eating.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>had</b> {{expected}} her to return in a shabby, or even needy, condition, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> stories of delightful weeks {{at a hotel in}} San Francisco, and beheld their poor shipwrecked neighbor dressed more handsomely than <b>they</b> <b>had</b> ever seen her, and with a new trunk standing in the lower hall which must contain something.|$|R
60|$|Old Mother West Wind {{had gone}} to her day's work, leaving all the Merry Little Breezes {{to play in the}} Green Meadows. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> played tag and run races with the Bees and played hide and seek with the Sun Beams, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{gathered}} around the Smiling Pool where on a green lily pad sat Grandfather Frog.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! yes," [...] said he, [...] "a {{very clear}} view of the city; oh, that was Solomon's temple, was it? <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a mosque there, have they? Ah! perhaps the Brahmins will have a turn at it before the world is done. It's a barren sort of hill after all, is it not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Citizen Merlin {{gave it to}} me just now," [...] began Anne Mie more quietly; [...] "he {{seems very}} wroth at finding nothing compromising against you, Paul. They were {{a long time in the}} kitchen, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> gone to search my room and Pétronelle's; but Merlin--oh! that awful man!--he seemed like a beast infuriated with his disappointment." ...|$|E
60|$|In addition, primary {{education}} endeavours {{to fit a}} boy out with a certain equipment of positive knowledge. He is taught the great laws of morality; the religion of his sect; so much history and geography as will tell him where the great {{countries of the world}} are, what they are, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> become what they are.|$|E
6000|$|... "There, <b>now,</b> she's hard <b>and</b> fast!" [...] roared the captain, as he stormed {{about the}} deck in a {{paroxysm}} of rage. But man's rage could avail nothing. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> missed the passage {{by a few}} feet, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to wait the fall and rise again of the tide ere they could hope to get off.|$|R
6000|$|The {{two sisters}} had come partly downstairs, but their London habits had {{restrained}} them from following to the street-door, as Clara <b>had</b> done; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> rushed up again, while Clara, {{with one foot}} on the staircase, looked in her cousin's face, as he tried to smile in answer, and repeated, 'Louis, I hoped you were quite happy.' ...|$|R
60|$|In {{accordance}} with this plan, Rollo's {{father and mother}} remained in Paris {{a few days after}} Mr. George and Rollo had left that city; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> just arrived in London. Jane came with them. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> it happened, by a very remarkable coincidence, that Mr. George and Rollo met them in St. Paul's Churchyard when they were going to visit the cathedral.|$|R
6000|$|... "What you cannot think, a Vivian {{can do and}} does!" [...] said Raymond, bitterly. [...] "My {{belief is}} that he was decoyed into being fleeced by the father, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> done their worst, he is cast off. He came home with us, but sat outside, and I could not get a word out of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Allemachter, Oom Silas, {{it is bad}} news. You {{have heard}} of the bymakaar at Paarde Kraal. Frank Muller wanted me to go, but I would not, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{declared}} war on the British Government and sent a proclamation to Lanyon. There will be fighting, Oom Silas, the land will run with blood, and the poor rooibaatjes will be shot down like buck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{make out}} of it that Merwell and Jasniff are guilty!” burst out Dave. “They went from here to Florida, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> either gone to sea, or are going, as soon as that {{schooner}} sails. Do you notice what Luke says about their being scared almost to death when they saw him? They evidently thought some of us, or the officers of the law, were with him.” ...|$|E
50|$|However, Serbs {{considered}} this too late, {{as it was}} not the amount of autonomy <b>they</b> wanted, <b>and</b> by <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> declared de facto independence.|$|R
50|$|Carlos Mikhail Kudriavtsev Sevilla-Sacasa, (b. Washington D.C., United States) {{was married}} to Leyla Argüello-Olivas Grons (b.Nicaragua) <b>and</b> <b>now</b> (divorced) <b>they</b> <b>have</b> one child.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are coming!" [...] {{came from}} Dan Casey, {{just as the}} nearest of the trees was gained. [...] "Back, ye rascals!" [...] he shouted, and fired {{as quickly as he}} could. Casey was right; the Tagals were {{surrounding}} them, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to fight back to back, in as hot a contest as the young captain <b>had</b> ever seen. <b>They</b> were clearly outnumbered, but retreat was impossible, for the Filipinos surrounded them upon every side.|$|R
60|$|FRIEND FALL,--Redpath {{tells me}} to blow up. Here goes! I wanted you to scare Rondout off with a big price. $125 ain't big. I got $100 the first time I ever talked there <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a much larger hall. It is a hard town to get to--I run a chance of getting caught by the ice and missing next engagement. Make the price $150 and let them draw out.|$|E
6000|$|... "What has North Carolina {{done for}} Franklin?" [...] he cried. [...] "Protected her? No. Repudiated her? Yes. You gave {{her to the}} Confederacy for a war debt, and the Confederacy flung her back. You shook yourselves free from Carolina's tyranny, and traitors betrayed you again. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> betrayed your leader. Will you avenge him, or will you sit down like cowards while they hang him for treason?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bad!" [...] said one. [...] "The {{people have}} {{made up their minds}} {{they were going to have}} the sacking of Soderini's house, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been balked we shall have them turning on us, if we don't take care. I suspect there are some Mediceans buzzing about among them, and we may see them attacking your palace over the bridge before long, unless we can find a bait for them another way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Did Monsieur wish {{to go to}} La Sablerie? Ah! then he did {{not know}} what had happened. The {{soldiers}} had been there; there had been a great burning. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> been out in their boats at sea, but <b>they</b> <b>had</b> seen the sky red--red as a furnace, all night; and the steeple was down. Surely, Monsieur had missed the steeple that was a guide to all poor seafarers; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to go all the way to Brancour to sell their fish.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> indeed departed. There {{was a pause}} of {{complete}} silence after <b>they</b> <b>had</b> disappeared, the slight and not painful reaction after the mirthful excitement {{of the last few}} hours. At length Herbert, dropping, as was his evening custom, a few drops of orange-flower into a tumbler of water, said, 'Annabel, my love, I am rather surprised that neither you nor Venetia should have mentioned to me that you knew, and knew so intimately, a man like Lord Cadurcis.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Once {{more the}} birds cry in their loneliness, [...] But <b>now</b> <b>they</b> wheel about our heads; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> [...] <b>They</b> <b>have</b> {{dropped on the}} grey stone to the north-east.|$|R
