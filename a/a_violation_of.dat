40|$|Contextuality and nonlocality are two {{fundamental}} properties of nature. Hardy's proof {{is considered the}} simplest proof of nonlocality and {{can also be seen}} as <b>a</b> particular <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> the simplest Bell inequality. A fundamental question is: Which is the simplest proof of contextuality? We show that there is a Hardy-like proof of contextuality that can also be seen as <b>a</b> particular <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> the simplest noncontextuality inequality. Interestingly, this new proof connects this inequality with the proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem, providing the missing link between these {{two fundamental}} results, and can be extended to an arbitrary odd number $n$ of settings, an extension that can be seen as <b>a</b> particular <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> the $n$-cycle inequality.

5|$|In 1895, the International Institute of Bibliography, {{located in}} Belgium {{and led by}} Paul Otlet, {{contacted}} Dewey {{about the possibility of}} translating the classification into French, and using the classification system for bibliographies (as opposed to its use for books in libraries). This would have required some changes to the classification, which was under copyright. Dewey gave permission {{for the creation of a}} version intended for bibliographies, and also for its translation into French. Dewey did not agree, however, to allow the International Institute of Bibliography to later create an English version of the resulting classification, considering that <b>a</b> <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> their agreement, as well as <b>a</b> <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> Dewey's copyright. Shortly after Dewey's death in 1931, however, an agreement was reached between the committee overseeing the development of the Decimal Classification and the developers of the French Classification Decimal. The English version was published as the Universal Decimal Classification and is still in use today.|$|E

5|$|In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2011), the {{applicant}} sought a declaration that section 377A of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. The High Court stated {{that a person}} who is asserting an infringement of a constitutional liberty must establish that he or she has not merely a sufficient interest but a substantial interest in the matter, that is, he or she must be alleging <b>a</b> <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> a fundamental liberty.

5|$|In early 2003 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries Office for Law Enforcement {{finished}} {{its investigation}} and charged Tran and Yu; Tai Loong Hong Marine Products Ltd., of Hong Kong, {{for whom the}} fins had been bought; and Chien Tan Nguyen, captain of the KD II, with 26 counts of violating the SFPA. They were assessed fines of $620,000, the highest civil penalty ever levied for <b>a</b> <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> the act.|$|E
5|$|Lastly, Tai Loong had argued, {{even if the}} KD II was {{a fishing}} vessel under the statute, the interplay between two {{sections}} of the SFPA and its implementing regulations rendered them unconstitutionally vague, {{making it impossible for}} it to easily determine whether the statute applied to the KD II. It argued that this failure of the government to thus provide adequate notice that the law would be enforced against such vessels was <b>a</b> <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> their right to due process.|$|E
