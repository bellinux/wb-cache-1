40|$|This article {{reports a}} {{research}} project that examined the background, status, understanding of and attitude to Design <b>and</b> <b>Craft</b> education (Hönnun og smíði) in Icelandic elementary schools. The main conclusions showed that certain aspects of Design <b>and</b> <b>Craft</b> need to be further defined in order to strengthen {{its position in the}} school system. Concepts were not clearly defined and research on Design <b>and</b> <b>Craft</b> education was lacking. The participants’ attitudes to Design <b>and</b> <b>Craft</b> were positive <b>and</b> the subject was popular amongst students. However, results showed a lack of understanding of the differences between basic terms such as Art, Design <b>and</b> <b>Craft.</b> All of the interviewees thought Design <b>and</b> <b>Craft</b> were important subjects for individualized learning and wanted to give them a more prominent role in general education. Design <b>and</b> <b>Craft</b> education in the Icelandic National Curriculum has not been fully realised. The research identified that schools have not allocated extra hours for the subjects, even though local authorities were supportive and flexibility existed in the time schedule. Lack of finances was, furthermore, not a hindrance to increased Design <b>and</b> <b>Craft</b> education. </p...|$|R

5|$|Though Arts <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> is {{specifically}} {{regarded as a}} movement within architecture, {{as opposed to a}} full-blown style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and very simple ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains functional elements associated with that movement. Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first in the stairwell to the gallery and its balusters and newel posts and then in the four-panel wooden interior door. The ceilings are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden fuse boxes that all evoke the Arts <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> movement.|$|E
