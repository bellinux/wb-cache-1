5|$|General {{aviation}} in the United Kingdom {{has been}} defined as a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule or military aviation. Although the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) excludes any form of remunerated aviation from its definition, some commercial operations are often included within the scope of general aviation (GA) in the UK. The sector operates business jets, rotorcraft, piston and jet-engined fixed-wing aircraft, gliders of all descriptions, and lighter than <b>air</b> <b>craft.</b> Public transport operations include business (or corporate) aviation and air taxi services, and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector. Other commercial GA activities are aerial work, such as surveying and air ambulances, and flight training, which {{plays an important role in}} the supply of pilots to the commercial air transport (CAT) industry. Private flying is conducted for personal transport and recreation. It includes a strong vintage aircraft movement, and encompasses a range of air sports, such as racing, aerobatics, and parachuting, at which British teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition.|$|E

2500|$|Starting in 1926, the U.S. Army Air Corps began {{awarding}} distinguished aerial badges. [...] The Air Corps held three gunnery matches; one for pursuit pilots, one for {{observation and}} attack pilots, {{and one for}} observers. [...] They also held two bombing matches, one for heavier than <b>air</b> <b>craft</b> and one for balloons. [...] Winners of these matches received either the Distinguished Aerial Gunner Badge or the Distinguished Aerial Bomber Badge. [...] These matches were suspended in 1932; thus, it's assumed these badges were retired sometime after that date.|$|E

2500|$|The corps was {{consequently}} enlarged to 100,000 {{men who had}} to face 20,000 Arabs and 8,000 Turks. The war {{turned into}} one of position. [...] Even {{some of the earliest}} examples of utilisation in modern warfare of armoured cars and air power by the Italian forces had little effect on the initial outcome. However, the war was notable for the first military use of heavier than <b>air</b> <b>craft.</b> Capitano Carlo Piazza flew the first military reconnaissance flight on 23 October 1911. A week later, Sottotenente Giulio Gavotti dropped four grenades on Taguira and Ain Zara in history's first aerial bombing.|$|E
2500|$|The American {{team at the}} {{competition}} was very impressed with the Russian design, thought it would sell well for Club class and student solo flying and bought {{one of the three}} prototypes to take home with them. The aircraft proved popular and so a US distributorship under the name Russia 12.6 was set up to sell the Russian production. Since the Aircraft Cooperative Mechta could not mass-produce the aircraft they reformed as Aviastroitel. In 1994 US distribution was transferred to Mechta Sailplanes, LLC, which imported 18 Russia gliders. Aviastroitel created a second set of molds to respond to the demand and started a second assembly line with a total production capacity of 48 AC-4s per year. In 1997 William Ayd became US distributor under the name Russia Sailplanes, Inc. Production of the AC-4 was suspended in 2003 when the Russian government changed the requirements for industrial production, making building them [...] uneconomical. In 2010 Aviastroitel became Glider <b>Air</b> <b>Craft</b> and production resumed.|$|E
2500|$|A law on {{explosives}} (Sprengstoffgesetz) was {{the subject}} of two application ordinances (on 17 November 1970 and 24 August 1971) and a general regulatory provision (19 May 1971), which covered respectively the application of the law to nationals of EC Member States, the duty of employers to notify in time the inspection authorities of detonation plans, the interpretation of the purpose and field of application of the law, authorizations for transport of explosives, and control and recognition of training courses on work with explosives. Taking into account the enormous high peaks of air traffic noise and its concentration at a limited number of airports, the Law for Protection against Aircraft Noise of 1971 sought to balance two conflicting demands, the first being the legitimate demand by industry, business and the public for an efficient air-traffic-system, and secondly, the understandable and by no means less legitimate claims of the affected people for protection and compensation. The legislation regulated the establishment of so-called [...] "Lärmschutzzonen" [...] (protection areas against aircraft noise) for all 11 international airports and for those 34 military airports used for jet <b>air</b> <b>craft,</b> and the law also authorised the Federal Department of the Interior to decree protection areas for each of those mentioned airports with approval by the [...] "Bundesrat," [...] the representation of the German Federal States.|$|E

60|$|They found a spot {{between the}} {{undergrowth}} and into it forced the biplane, until the <b>air</b> <b>craft</b> was completely surrounded.

The wind was gradually going down, but the sky was as dark and threatening as ever.|$|E

60|$|As my eyes wandered {{about the}} garden, {{the sight of}} the {{hundreds}} of <b>air</b> <b>craft</b> lying unguarded around us suggested the simplest avenue to freedom. Why it had not occurred to me before! I was thoroughly familiar with the mechanism of every known make of flier on Barsoom. For nine years I had sailed and fought with the navy of Helium.

60|$|We {{wasted no}} time in talk as we knew that the warriors would surely return as soon as they had gained control of their mounts. Hastening to his damaged machine we were bending every effort to finish the needed repairs and had almost {{completed}} them when we saw the two green monsters returning at top speed from opposite sides of us. When they had approached within a hundred yards their thoats again became unmanageable and absolutely refused to advance further toward the <b>air</b> <b>craft</b> which had frightened them.|$|E

The driver sits {{on top of this}} plane upon a seat constructed over the small, noiseless radium engine which propels it. The medium of buoyancy is contained within the thin metal walls of the body and consists of the eighth Barsoomian ray, or ray of propulsion, as it may be termed in view of its properties.|$|E
