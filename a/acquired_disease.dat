25|$|Aneurysm {{means an}} outpouching of a blood vessel wall that {{is filled with}} blood. Aneurysms occur at a point of {{weakness}} in the vessel wall. This can be because of <b>acquired</b> <b>disease</b> or hereditary factors. The repeated trauma of blood flow against the vessel wall presses against the point of weakness and causes the aneurysm to enlarge. As described by the Law of Young-Laplace, the increasing area increases tension against the aneurysmal walls, leading to enlargement.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} a weak form of a disease causing {{immunity}} to the virulent version was not new; this had been {{known for a long}} time for smallpox. Inoculation with smallpox (variolation) was known to result in a much less severe disease, and greatly reduced mortality, in comparison with the naturally <b>acquired</b> <b>disease.</b> Edward Jenner had also studied vaccination using cowpox (Vaccinia) to give cross-immunity to smallpox in the late 1790s, and by the early 1800s vaccination had spread to most of Europe.|$|E
25|$|Gene therapy {{involves}} supplying {{a functional}} gene to cells lacking that function, {{with the aim}} of correcting a genetic disorder or <b>acquired</b> <b>disease.</b> Gene therapy can be broadly divided into two categories. The first is alteration of germ cells, that is, sperm or eggs, which results in a permanent genetic change for the whole organism and subsequent generations. This “germ line gene therapy” is {{considered by many to be}} unethical in human beings. The second type of gene therapy, “somatic cell gene therapy”, is analogous to an organ transplant. In this case, one or more specific tissues are targeted by direct treatment or by removal of the tissue, addition of the therapeutic gene or genes in the laboratory, and return of the treated cells to the patient. Clinical trials of somatic cell gene therapy began in the late 1990s, mostly for the treatment of cancers and blood, liver, and lung disorders.|$|E

Advanced stages of the disease cause problems with the gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system and lead to diarrhea and nausea. Other advanced symptoms of pneumonia may also present. However, the disease is generally {{not a threat to}} most healthy individuals, and tends to lead to severe symptoms more often in immunocompromised hosts and the elderly. Consequently, the water systems of hospitals and nursing homes should be periodically monitored.

30|$|Gene {{therapy is}} {{described}} as the direct transfer of genetic material to cells or tissues {{for the treatment of}} inherited disorders and <b>acquired</b> <b>diseases.</b> The base of this therapeutic method is to introduce a gene encoding a functional protein altering the expression of an endogenous gene or possessing the capacity to cure or prevent the progression of a disease [1 – 3]. This method was initially performed in 1990 in the USA for the treatment of adenosine deaminase-deficient SCID (combined immune deficiency disease) patients [4]. This therapy is not only used in genetic deficiencies, but also in other complicated diseases, such as viral infection (human immunodeficiency virus), autoimmunity (rheumatoid arthritis), cancer, diabetes, coronary, and artery disease [5]. With the progress of this technique, gene therapy will become an effective therapeutic method for neurodegenerative conditions, hemophilia, AIDS, asthma, and the myriad of other genetic and <b>acquired</b> <b>diseases</b> that affect humanity [2].|$|R

5000|$|The {{notion of}} a weak form of a disease causing {{immunity}} to the virulent version was not new; this had been {{known for a long}} time for smallpox. Inoculation with smallpox (variolation) was known to result in far less scarring, and greatly reduced mortality, in comparison with the naturally <b>acquired</b> <b>disease.</b> The English physician Edward Jenner (1749-1823) had also discovered (1796) the process of vaccination by using cowpox to give cross-immunity to smallpox and by Pasteur's time this had generally replaced the use of actual smallpox material in inoculation. The difference between smallpox vaccination and anthrax or chicken cholera vaccination was that the weakened form of the latter two disease organisms had been [...] "generated artificially", so a naturally weak form of the disease organism did not need to be found. This discovery revolutionized work in infectious diseases and Pasteur gave these artificially weakened diseases the generic name [...] "vaccines", in honor of Jenner's groundbreaking discovery. In 1885, Pasteur produced his celebrated first vaccine for rabies by growing the virus in rabbits and then weakening it by drying the affected nerve tissue.|$|E

40|$|The intrauterine {{programming}} hypothesis {{states that}} the risk of <b>acquiring</b> <b>diseases</b> in adult life is determined in part by environmental factors during embryofetal development. Especially maternal nutrition has been related to the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and infectious diseases in the offspring in later life. In this report the scientific evidence for the existence of intrauterine programming is reviewed. Nutrition in pregnancy influences the morphology of conceptual organs, and therefore modulates their physiological functioning, which is reflected in hormone homeostasis and metabolic functions. Evidence is accumulating that intrauterine programming permanently modulates the risk of <b>acquiring</b> <b>diseases</b> in adulthood. Rather than general dietary parameters such as caloric intake and macronutrient supply, the balance between individual nutritional components seems to play an important role. Further research into intrauterine programming should ultimately aim at determining whether education for nutrition in pregnancy can aid in the prevention of diseases with high public health concern in society...|$|R
