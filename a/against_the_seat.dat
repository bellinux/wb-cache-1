5|$|As {{ruler of}} Thessalonica, Theodore quickly {{declared}} himself emperor, challenging the Nicaean emperor John III Vatatzes's {{claims to the}} Byzantine imperial throne. In 1225, he advanced {{to the outskirts of}} Constantinople, but his final attack <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of the much-reduced Latin Empire was delayed until 1230. In that year, Theodore amassed an army to besiege Constantinople, but then diverted it against Bulgaria, an ambivalent ally which threatened his northern flank. Theodore was defeated and captured at the Battle of Klokotnitsa, and spent the next seven years in captivity. In the meantime, he was succeeded by his brother Manuel. Manuel quickly lost Thrace, most of Macedonia, and Albania to the Bulgarian Tsar John II Asen. Thessalonica itself became a Bulgarian vassal, while in Epirus proper power was seized by Michael II, returning from exile.|$|E
25|$|The piston in {{the first}} stage is rigid and acts {{directly}} on the seat of the valve. The pressure in the intermediate pressure chamber drops when the diver inhales from the second stage valve, this causes the piston to lift off the stationary valve seat as the piston slides into the intermediate pressure chamber. The now open valve permits high pressure gas to flow into the medium pressure chamber until the pressure in the chamber has risen enough to push the piston back into its original position <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> and thus close the valve.|$|E
2500|$|Savitskaya was {{conscious}} during the fall, which lasted eight minutes. She survived {{partly because the}} 4х3 m aircraft fragment she was in started to glide and landed on a soft, swampy glade. Savitskaya also pushed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> with her hands and feet, [...] "perhaps hoping to absorb the blow" [...] in her own words. The impact with the ground, however, knocked her temporarily unconscious. She sustained a concussion, a broken arm and rib and some spinal injuries.|$|E

60|$|A soiled man {{and woman}} munch {{sandwiches}} and throw the crusts on the floor. A large brick-colored Norwegian takes off his shoes, grunts in relief, and props his feet in their thick gray socks <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> in front of him.|$|E
6000|$|The {{seamstress}} {{answered in}} her quiet voice: [...] "Very comfortable this is. Sit still, Stanley!" [...] Her little son, whose feet {{did not reach}} the floor, was drumming his heels <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> He {{stopped and looked at}} her, and the old butler addressed him.|$|E
60|$|He got shakily to his feet. His head spun. He was weak, shattered, {{trembling}} violently. The man {{was coming}} down the walk after him. Cole pulled himself onto the cart, gasping and retching. The horses jumped into life. Cole rolled over <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> sick with {{the motion of the}} swaying cart.|$|E
50|$|Tall: Either section (or both) of <b>the</b> rear <b>seat</b> cushion fold up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>seat</b> back, {{allowing}} for {{an area of}} 1.28 meters (4.2 ft) in height.|$|R
60|$|As he came {{he fixed}} his gaze upon a woman <b>seated</b> near <b>the</b> {{prostrate}} girl, {{and with a}} horrible outcry the victim leaped {{into the air and}} stiffened as if smitten with epilepsy. She fell against some scared boys, who let her fall, striking her head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats.</b> She too rolled down upon the straw and lay beside her sister. Both had round, pretty, but childish faces.|$|R
50|$|The gangs {{operated}} from internet cafes to {{the college}} premises. They used to introduce themselves as the personal assistants of college directors, doctors and claimed to yield considerable influence {{in the office of}} DMAT. The candidates who paid the amount were directed to leave the OMR sheet blank and were filled later. The state quota and NRI seats used to get filled up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> that were vacated {{on the last day of}} the admission process.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile {{the big man}} heaved and struggled, {{swung the}} woman round <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> and the table, in his convulsive effort to get free. But she pinned down his arms like a {{cuttlefish}} wreathed heavily upon him. And he heaved and swayed, and they crashed about the room, the soldiers hopping, the furniture bumping.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stand {{firm to the}} mess-chest!" [...] half-whispered the Skimmer, motioning to {{his companions}} to place {{themselves}} in attitudes to support the weaker of their party, while, with sedulous care, he braced his own athletic person in a manner to throw all of its weight and strength <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> [...] "Stand firm, and be ready!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Down, down! The {{cuttings}} {{were becoming}} precipitous cliffs, the drag made dismal groans; Aubrey, after a great slip forward, looking injured, anchored himself, {{with his feet}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> by Ethel; and Dr. Spencer was effectually wakened by an involuntary forward plunge of his opposite neighbour. 'Can this be safe?' quoth Ethel; 'should not some of us get out?' ...|$|E
6000|$|After looking round, I found a {{stick and}} went to {{scraping}} out the pen, which was awkward work enough, for another boat called the [...] "jolly-boat," [...] was capsized right over the longboat, which brought them almost close together. These two boats {{were in the middle}} of the deck. I managed to crawl inside of the long-boat; and after barking my shins <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats,</b> and bumping my head a good many times, I got along to the stern, where the pig-pen was.|$|R
5000|$|The Ultras {{and many}} other fans protested at several home games <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> {{and some of the}} rules of the arena which they {{perceive}} as [...] "fan unfriendly". For example, a spectator may not enter with a megaphone or a pennant that a single person cannot carry unfurled, and pennant poles with a length of over one metre are prohibited. The complaint is that these rules and <b>the</b> designer <b>seats</b> put a damper on the fan experience. The presence of a large fence and safety nets in front of <b>the</b> southern curve (<b>seat</b> bloc reserved for fans of the FC Bayern Munich) are also often criticized.|$|R
5000|$|Noted for its {{innovative}} <b>seating</b> configurations, <b>the</b> Villager {{featured a}} folding, removable, middle seat (or two buckets) {{along with a}} non-removable, fold-and-slide track-mounted rear <b>seat.</b> <b>The</b> arrangement enabled <b>the</b> rear <b>seat</b> to slide forward to the middle position for five-passenger seating, or completely forward <b>against</b> <b>the</b> front <b>seats</b> for a larger cargo volume.|$|R
60|$|While the reeling train {{alternately}} flung him to {{the window}} and <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> he gazed out at the wheeling peaks, the snow-laden pines, and the mighty gorges, through which the icy river ran, green as grass in its quiet eddies. On every side were wild hillsides meshed with fallen trees, and each new vista contained its distant peak. It was the realization of his imagination of the Alleghanies.|$|E
60|$|Nat Poole shuffled off, looking {{anything}} but pleased. Hardly had he gone when several {{came in from}} the car ahead, also looking for seats. Among them was Isaac Pludding. He had had a seat near a door, but had given it up to look for something better, and now he had nothing. He glanced bitterly at the students as he passed, then came back and leaned heavily <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> Dave and Roger were occupying. In doing this he almost knocked Dave's hat from his head.|$|E
6000|$|They {{pushed their}} heads above the blue water {{and looked around}} the cave. It was silent and deserted. Floating gently near the spot where they had left it was their own little boat. Cap'n Bill swam to it, took hold of the side, and then turned an inquiring face toward the mermaids. [...] "Climb in," [...] said the Queen. So he pulled himself up and awkwardly tumbled forward into the boat. As he did so, he heard his wooden leg clatter <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> and turned around to look at it wonderingly.|$|E
50|$|The St Marylebone {{by-election}} of 5 December 1963 {{was held}} after Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Wavell Wakefield became a hereditary peer. Though {{there was a}} large swing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> government, <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> was retained for the Conservatives by Quintin Hogg, who had renounced his peerage in order to re-enter the House of Commons, in the hope of being chosen as party leader following the resignation of Harold MacMillan, and thereby becoming Prime Minister. Hogg went on to hold <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> in <b>the</b> 1966 and 1970 General Elections. Like his predecessor, Hogg would leave <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> on being given a life peerage.|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time Sally {{became aware of the}} {{atmosphere}} of nerves. Mr. Bunbury, who seemed to be a man of temperament, picked up his walking-stick, which was leaning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> next <b>seat,</b> and flung it with some violence across the house.|$|R
50|$|It {{was not an}} {{easy task}} to get this recognition, Argentina kicked <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> given to Africa and Asia arguing that the {{standard}} of football in these continents was not good enough, although at the previous Congress in Paris in 1953 it was agreed that Africa will be given the right to be represented subsequently. There was a long, heated argument. Africa's position was supported by Great Britain and the eastern countries, 24 votes in favour, 17 <b>against.</b> <b>The</b> Congress then elected Abdel Aziz Abdallah Salem to represent Africa on the Executive Committee until a confederation was founded. Then, the African delegation agreed to meet in Lisbon in 1956 {{on the occasion of the}} FIFA Congress to realise the project.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{the price}} of a pair of dungarees," [...] Ahuhu {{concluded}} his list of needs. [...] "I have ridden much and hard after your cattle, Kanaka Oolea, and where my dungarees have pressed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of the saddle there is no seat to my dungarees. It is not well that it be said that a Kanaka Oolea cowboy, who is also a cousin of Kanaka Oolea's wife's half-sister, should be shamed to be seen out of the saddle save that he walks backward from all that behold him." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{did not say}} a word, but let Rectus and me do as we chose, and we got {{her over}} the railing in no time. I braced myself <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> that ran around the deck, and lowered. Rectus leaned over and directed, {{holding on to the}} line as well. I felt strong enough to hold two of her, with the rope running over the rail. I let her go down pretty fast, for I was afraid the boat would be off; but {{directly}} Rectus called to me to stop.|$|E
6000|$|I woke with {{stiff and}} cramped muscles from having slept {{long on the}} incommodious seat of a day coach. I leaned my head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> and tried to think. After a long time I said to myself: [...] "I must have a name of some sort." [...] I searched my pockets. Not a card; not a letter; not a paper or {{monogram}} could I find. But I found in my coat pocket nearly $3,000 in bills of large denomination. [...] "I must be some one, of course," [...] I repeated to myself, and began again to consider.|$|E
50|$|Stensholt {{lost his}} <b>seat</b> in <b>the</b> 2010 {{election}} when the ALP was voted out of office, with a 9.6% swing <b>against</b> him seeing <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> return to Liberal hands.|$|R
50|$|Bypassing the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Berg filed a {{petition}} for a writ of certiorari before judgment in the United States Supreme Court. On December 10, 2008, the Supreme Court denied Berg's {{request for an}} injunction <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> of <b>the</b> Electoral College, scheduled for December 15. On December 15, 2008, the petitioner refiled the application for injunction. Two days later, Berg's appeal was denied without comment by Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Berg's previously denied request for an injunction was refiled with Justice Antonin Scalia on December 18, 2008. On January 12, the Supreme Court denied the petition for certiorari. The application for stay addressed to Justice Scalia and referred to the Court was also summarily denied on January 21, 2009.|$|R
60|$|Claire {{sank back}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{cushioned}} <b>seat</b> {{and her eyes}} filled with tears of disappointment. Of all the things which would have chimed in with her discontented mood at that moment a sudden flight to America was the most alluring. Only one consideration held her back--she had not the money for her fare.|$|R
6000|$|... "Steer {{for your}} life, Mahomed!" [...] I yelled. He was a skilful steersman, and {{well acquainted with}} the dangers of this most perilous coast, and I saw him grip the tiller, bend his heavy frame forward, {{and stare at the}} foaming terror till his big round eyes looked as though they would start out of his head. The send of the sea was driving the boat's head round to starboard. If we struck the line of {{breakers}} fifty yards to starboard of the gap we must sink. It was a great field of twisting, spouting waves. Mahomed planted his foot <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> before him, and, glancing at him, I saw his brown toes spread out like a hand with the weight he put upon them as he took the strain of the tiller. She came round a bit, but not enough. I roared to Job to back water, whilst I dragged and laboured at my oar. She answered now, and none too soon.|$|E
6000|$|Was {{the thing}} coming on again? He felt in his trouser-pocket for some matches, and found one remaining. He tried to strike this, but {{the floor was}} wet, and it spat and went out. He cursed. He could not see where the door was situated. In his {{struggle}} he had quite lost his bearings. The strange beast, disturbed by the splutter of the match, began to move again. [...] "Time!" [...] called Woodhouse, with a sudden gleam of mirth, but the thing was not coming at him again. He must have hurt it, he thought, with the broken bottle. He felt a dull pain in his ankle. Probably he was bleeding there. He wondered if it would support him {{if he tried to}} stand up. The night outside was very still. There was no sound of any one moving. The sleepy fools had not heard those wings battering upon the dome, nor his shouts. It was no good wasting strength in shouting. The monster flapped its wings and startled him into a defensive attitude. He hit his elbow <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> and it fell over with a crash. He cursed this, and then he cursed the darkness.|$|E
6000|$|... "I used to {{make him}} very unhappy; I was very strict with him, when I knew he couldn't bear any kind of strictness. And he was always so patient with me; though he never really cared for me. Oh, yes, I knew that from the first! He used to try; but {{he must have been}} glad to get away. Poor Bartley! It was cruel, cruel, to put that in about my abandoning him when he knew I would come back; but perhaps the lawyers told him he must; he had to put in something! Why shouldn't I let him go? Father said he only {{wanted to get rid of}} me, so that he could marry some one else--Yes, yes; it was that that made me start! Father knew it would! Oh," [...] she grieved, with a wild self-pity that tore Halleck's heart, [...] "he knew it would!" [...] She fell wearily back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> and did not speak for some minutes. Then she said, in a slow, broken utterance: [...] "But now I don't seem to mind even that, any more. Why shouldn't he marry some one else that he really likes, if he doesn't care for me?" ...|$|E
