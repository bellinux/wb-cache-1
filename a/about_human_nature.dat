5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chessick also {{acknowledged}} {{the dangers of}} relativism implicit in ontological hermeneutics. He acknowledges that the art and theory of interpretation is not bound by today's methods of science that aim to prevent nihilism and relativism. However, Bernstein {{has pointed out that}} there never could be any hard and fast rules or methods for interpretation because it does not aim to be a science. Gadamer states that the methods of the natural sciences are too impoverished to reveal many truths <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> and likewise advocated for a hermeneutic approach. Others have made similar arguments for ontological hermeneutics. Chessick writes that the limitations preventing the natural sciences from uncovering certain truths <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> is precisely why Dilthey initially advocated for a distinction between the natural and human sciences, paving the way for hermeneutics to become a method of inquiry.|$|E

40|$|James W. Jones {{develops}} {{three major}} theses in Religion and Psychology in Transition (1996). First, he argues, Freud was wrong <b>about</b> religion, <b>human</b> <b>nature,</b> and gender. Second, he maintains, the object relations theorists are right <b>about</b> religion, <b>human</b> <b>nature,</b> and gender. And third, he proposes, {{we need to}} reconsider the problem of reductionism in psychological studies of religion. I agree with Jones on two of these and I disagree on one. Two out of three: not bad...|$|R
5000|$|Conceptually, Thomas Rawle has {{described}} United in Isolation as [...] "almost a concept album", with a main lyrical [...] "focal point". [...] "In {{a very broad}} sense, it's <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature's</b> desire to always be coupled with another, and how love can sometimes be a vessel of selfishness. It's almost like animal behaviour, and I guess we are animals, just with language and ego".|$|R
25|$|Huston's {{films were}} {{insightful}} <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> and human predicaments. They also sometimes included scenes or brief dialogue passages that were remarkably prescient concerning environmental issues {{that came to}} public awareness in the future, in the period starting about 1970; examples include The Misfits and The Night of the Iguana (1964). Huston spent long evenings carousing in the Nevada casinos after filming, surrounded by reporters and beautiful women, gambling, drinking, and smoking cigars.|$|E
25|$|The existentialist {{philosopher and}} nobel prize-winning author Albert Camus {{centered}} on a discussion of Ivan Karamazov's revolt in his 1951 book Rebel. According to the philosopher Charles B. Guignon, the novel's most fascinating character, Ivan Karamazov, had {{by the middle of}} the twentieth century become the icon of existentialist rebellion in the writings of Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre. An important part of the novel is the poem The Grand Inquisitor, told by Ivan, which is one of the best-known passages in modern literature because of its ideas <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature,</b> freedom, power, authority, and religion, and for its fundamental ambiguity. A reference to the poem can be found in Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World Revisited and David Foster Wallace's novel Infinite Jest.|$|E
25|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin kills off main characters because he finds it very irritating to know early in the story who as the hero will come through unscathed. Martin dislikes this lack of realism, comparing the situation to a soldier scared the night before a battle. Martin wants his readers to feel {{that no one is}} safe as they turn the page. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature,</b> and points readers not wanting to get upset or disturbed to the plenty of books for comfort reading.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Cloten, [...] "the conceited, booby lord", is discussed as {{an occasion for}} noting how Shakespeare depicted what is most contradictory in human nature. Cloten, [...] "with all the absurdity of his person and manners, is not without shrewdness in his observations."

It {{could be that}} just as victims of tragedy {{find it hard to}} accept that their {{suffering}} is random and purposeless, voters find it intolerable that so many of the petty, shortsighted moves by elected officials have no greater meaning than small-time expediency." [...] She also notes that the series [...] "is more cynical than The Americans on FX and more pessimistic <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> than The Walking Dead on AMC". However, The Americans [...] "is more complex and inventive" [...] according to Stanley who concurs that season 2 is darker but notes it is more compelling than season 1. [...] Stuever compares the show unfavorably to both Veep for its [...] "bumbling chaos and ego implosions" [...] over House of Cards [...] "prohibitively sinister" [...] execution and The Good Wife for its superior delivery of [...] "nastiness and self-interest in power plays".|$|E

500|$|Among {{the most}} {{significant}} intellectual figures associated with Romanticism was Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881), born in Scotland and later a resident of London. He was largely responsible for bringing the works of German Romantics such as Schiller and Goethe {{to the attention of}} a British audience. An essayist and historian, he invented the phrase [...] "hero-worship", lavishing largely uncritical praise on strong leaders such as Oliver Cromwell, Frederick the Great and Napoleon. His [...] (1837) dramatised the plight of the French aristocracy, but stressed the inevitability of history as a force. With French historian Jules Michelet, he is {{associated with the use of}} the [...] "historical imagination". In Romantic historiography this led to a tendency to emphasise sentiment and identification, inviting readers to sympathise with historical personages and even to imagine interactions with them. In contrast to many continental Romantic historians, Carlyle remained largely pessimistic <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> and events. He believed that history was a form of prophecy that could reveal patterns for the future. In the late nineteenth century he became one of a number of Victorian sage writers and social commentators.|$|E
500|$|In general, {{the world}} of these early volumes is a [...] " [...] and ... divided place." [...] In these early titles, the boys are cynical <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature,</b> an {{attitude}} apparently justified when the police, whom they have repeatedly helped, throw them into jail on slim evidence in The Great Airport Mystery (1930). The police and authority figures in general come off poorly in these books, {{so much so that}} at one point Edward Stratemeyer wrote McFarlane to reprimand him for [...] "grievous lack of respect for officers of the law." [...] The Hardys are less affluent than earlier Stratemeyer characters; they eagerly accept cash rewards largely to finance college educations, and, with their parents, strive to please their Aunt Gertrude, because she possesses a small fortune. The rich are portrayed as greedy and selfish. This view of the world reflects McFarlane's relative [...] "lack [...] sympathy with the American power structure." [...] In his autobiography, McFarlane described his rationale for writing the books this way, writing: [...] "I had my own thoughts about teaching youngsters that obedience to authority is somehow sacred.... Would civilization crumble if kids got the notion that the people who ran the world were sometimes stupid, occasionally wrong and even corrupt at times?" ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{influential}} quote by Heraclitus [...] "ἦθος ἀνθρώπῳ δαίμων" [...] (DK 22B119) has led {{to numerous}} interpretations. Whether in this context, [...] "daimon" [...] can indeed be translated to mean [...] "fate" [...] is disputed; however, it lends much sense to Heraclitus' observations and conclusions <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> in general.

2500|$|The {{proposal}} that reason gives humanity a special position in nature {{has been argued}} to be a defining characteristic of western philosophy and later western modern science, starting with classical Greece. Philosophy {{can be described as}} a way of life based upon reason, and in the other direction reason has been one of the major subjects of philosophical discussion since ancient times. Reason is often said to be reflexive, or [...] "self-correcting," [...] and the critique of reason has been a persistent theme in philosophy. It has been defined in different ways, at different times, by different thinkers <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Masters {{described}} her fiction: [...] "All my writing is about human behaviour. There's not much drama, no great happenings in it. No violence. It's about the violence that's inside the human heart, I think, {{more than anything}} else". In the same interview she also credits her journalistic career for helping her creative writing: [...] "you would sometimes take quite an ordinary and humble person and write a story about them, and you'd {{be surprised at the}} quality that there was in the ordinary human being ... I learned a lot <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature,</b> and human behaviour, as a journalist ... there is more in life, more in situations, than meets the eye".|$|E

50|$|Steve Smith {{has argued}} that the differing {{positions}} have largely ignored each other meaning that it makes little sense to talk of 'debates' between rival theoretical frameworks.

He collected his thoughts and conclusions <b>about</b> the <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> in his book Après avoir…, in many respects the inaugural work of the micropsychoanalytical thought.|$|R
2500|$|Cherryh's works depict {{fictional worlds}} with great realism {{supported}} by her strong background in languages, history, archaeology, and psychology. In her introduction to Cherryh's first book, Andre Norton compared {{the effect of}} the work to Tolkien's: [...] "Never since reading The Lord of the Rings have I been so caught up in any tale as I have been in Gate of Ivrel." [...] Another reviewer commented, [...] "Her blend of science and folklore gives the novels an intellectual depth comparable to Tolkien or Gene Wolfe". [...] Cherryh creates believable alien cultures, species, and perspectives, causing the reader to reconsider basic assumptions <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature.</b> Her worlds have been praised as complex and realistic because she presents them through implication rather than explication. She describes the difficulties of translating/expressing concepts between differing languages. This is best demonstrated in both the Chanur and Foreigner series.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film {{four out of}} four stars and described the film as [...] "a dazzling movie from Walt Disney in which computers {{have been used to}} make themselves romantic and glamorous. Here's a technological sound-and-light show that is sensational and brainy, stylish, and fun". However, {{near the end of his}} review, he noted (in a positive tone), [...] "This is an almost wholly technological movie. Although it's populated by actors who are engaging (Bridges, Cindy Morgan) or sinister (Warner), it is not really a movie <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature.</b> Like Star Wars or The Empire Strikes Back, but much more so, this movie is a machine to dazzle and delight us". Ebert closed his first annual Overlooked Film Festival with a showing of Tron. Tron was also featured in Siskel and Ebert's video pick of the week in 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Judaism {{rejects the}} belief in [...] "original sin." [...] Both ancient and modern Judaism teaches that every person is {{responsible}} for his own actions. However, the existence of some [...] "innate sinfulness on each human being was discussed" [...] in both biblical (Genesis 8:21, Psalms 51.5) and post-biblical sources. Some apocrypha and pseudepigraphic sources express pessimism <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> ("A grain of evil seed was sown in Adam's heart from the beginning"), and the Talmud (b. Avodah Zarah 22b) has an unusual passage which Edward Kessler describes as [...] "the serpent seduced Eve in paradise and impregnated her with spiritual-physical 'dirt' which was inherited through the generations," [...] but the revelation at Sinai and the reception of the Torah cleansed Israel. Kessler states that [...] "although {{it is clear that}} belief in some form of original sin did exist in Judaism, it did not become mainstream teaching, nor dogmatically fixed," [...] but remained at the margins of Judaism.|$|E

25|$|Ontological hermeneutics {{affirms that}} human beings exist in a world around them and that through {{background}} a priori (before experience) foreknowledge, they constantly seek to understand themselves and that world, including other humans and inanimate objects. Heidegger termed human beings as Dasein, the German word for being-there. In other words, an individual is termed Dasein {{because he or she}} exists there, being there at some place in the present. Put in more simple terms, an individual is Dasein because he or she literally exists. Heidegger, along with Dilthey, was concerned <b>about</b> understanding <b>human</b> <b>nature,</b> what it means to exist, to be.|$|R
