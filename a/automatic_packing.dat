The conception of solutions that rationalize and automate the placement {{study of a}} set of components that compose a certain product, {{on the surface of the}} material on which they have to be cut, has, as main purposes, the increase of the flexibility of the cutting process, the reduction of the global time production and the minimization of the amount of wasted raw material. The present work describes computational tools capable of increasing the level of automation and efficiency of a shape packing study, as a stage of preparation of a cutting process. As a starting point, we have the building of a general library as a support to placement studies, and able to answer a diversified set of geometrical problems.

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} {{practical}} approach to generate stochastic anisotropic samples with Poisson-disk characteristic over a two-dimensional domain. In contrast to isotropic samples, we understand anisotropic samples as non-overlapping ellipses whose size and density match a given anisotropic metric. Anisotropic noise samples {{are useful for}} many visualization and graphics applications. The spot samples {{can be used as}} input for texture generation, e. g., line integral convolution (LIC), but can also be used directly for visualization. The definition of the spot samples using a metric tensor makes them especially suitable for the visualization of tensor fields that can be translated into a metric. Our work combines ideas from sampling theory and mesh generation to approximate generalized blue noise properties. To generate these samples with the desired properties we first construct a set of non-overlapping ellipses whose distribution closely matches the underlying metric. This set of samples is used as input for a generalized anisotropic Lloyd relaxation to distribute noise samples more evenly. Instead of computing the Voronoi tessellation explicitly, we introduce a discrete approach which combines the Voronoi cell and centroid computation in one step. Our method supports <b>automatic</b> <b>packing</b> of the elliptical samples, resulting in textures similar to those generated by anisotropic reaction-diffusion methods. We use Fourier analysis tools for quality measurement of uniformly distributed samples. The resulting samples have nice sampling properties, e. g., they satisfy a blue noise property where low frequencies in the power spectrum are reduced to a minimum.

40|$|Eggshell damage poses {{a serious}} problem for the {{consumption}} egg industry. Increasing the maximum age of laying hens will increase eggshell damage due to loss of shell strength. This poses {{a serious problem}} for <b>automatic</b> collection, <b>packing,</b> and transport. We performed a model based study focused on hairline fractures in eggs of 88 -week-old hens, and simulated side collisions on 1, 235 eggs using a specially designed pendulum. The kinetic energy {{at the moment of}} impact was related to the accelerations measured by an electronic egg going through the transport chain. Further, several egg mechanical properties were measured. For collisions with a realistic impact, fracture occurrence correlated negatively with dynamic stiffness (14 %), mass (15 %), shape index (9 %), and damping ratio (12 %). We manipulated the data set to investigate the influence of improving egg properties. Removing the least favorable 50 % of the eggs based on stiffness and mass resulted in a moderate reduction of fracture occurrence, from 7. 7 % down to 4. 4 %. The peak acceleration of an egg running through the transport chain lies typically in the range of 15 to 45 g. Our model predicts that a moderate decrease from 30 g down to 20 g will result in a drastic reduction of fracture occurrence from 7. 7 % down to 0. 3 to 1 % (95 % confidence region), whereas an increase to 40 g will increase fracture occurrence to 42 to 55 %. The model predicts that severe collisions pose a relatively high risk for eggshell damage, which suggests that a reduction of collision severity is of first priority when increasing the age of laying hens...|$|R

In order to solve forage overproduction and supply steadily corn silage to a farm, the objective {{of this study was to}} design and evaluate an <b>automatic</b> <b>packing</b> system for making corn silage in the plastic bags. This system could also reduce the packing time and save labor, and improve the quality of corn silage. Physical properties of forage corn were determined and analyzed as a design basis for prototype of packing machine. Moisture content of experimental samples of forage corn, grown in spring, was 73 %. The average length and bulk density of samples were 12. 8 mm and 0. 172, respectively. In compression test, lots of water leaked out as gauge pressure reached 50 kg/cm 2. Hence, design criterion would be based on gauge pressure with 40 kg/cm 2. The regression equation, with the coefficient of correlation of 0. 9949, was obtained The average thickness of the PE bag used for storing corn silage was 0. 12 mm. The tensile strengths in lateral and longitudinal directions were 134 kg/cm 2 and 140. 4 kg/cm 2, respectively. After being sealed by heat, tensile strengths were changed to 144. 9 kg/cm 2, 129. 8 kg/cm 2, and 114. 4 kg/cm 2 for 2, 4, and 6 layers, respectively. The smallest tensile strength of 6 layers was greater than the compressive pressure. For the prototype, the average rate of packing was 19 sec/bag and successful packing rate was 90 %. 目前臺灣農牧工作人力短缺，能使用的人力資源有限，所以如何將工作自動化是很重要的課題，而現今儲存包裝牧草乃是一項既費時且耗費人力的工作。為了解決牧草生產過剩並穩定供給酪農青貯料，本研究目的在設計與製造一部青割玉米太空包自動封裝機，以降低太空包封裝時間，減少對人工之依賴及提高青貯品質。 試驗初期，先對青割玉米做基本物性之量測與分析，以此作為太空包封裝機之設計依據；取樣量測的春作青割玉米其含水率 73 %，總平均之細切長度 12. 8 mm，平均虛表比重 0. 172 。在壓縮密度試驗下，當錶壓力達至 50 kg/cm 2 時，壓縮缸內之青貯玉米已有大量水份滲出，設定壓縮青貯包裝時的最大錶壓力應為 40 kg/cm 2 ，求得其迴歸方程式為壓縮比相關係數為 0. 9949 。青貯用PE袋，平均厚度為 0. 12 mm，抗拉應力横向為 134 kg/cm 2 、縱向為 140. 4 kg/cm 2 。熱封後之抗拉應力兩層為 144. 9 kg/cm 2 、四層為 129. 8 kg/cm 2 、六層為 114. 4 kg/cm 2 。其中最小的六層抗拉應力仍遠大於壓縮密度壓力。 自動封裝雛型機的封裝平均速度為 19 秒/袋。封裝成功率為 90 %。目錄 摘要 I ABSTRACT II 目錄 III 圖目錄 VII 表目錄 XI 第一章 前 言 1 1. 1 研究動機 1 1. 2 研究目的 3 1. 3 研究項目 3 第二章 文獻探討 6 2. 1 加入WTO對產業之影響 6 2. 2 青貯之定義 7 2. 3 青貯之歷史 7 2. 4 芻料作物品種 8 2. 5 青貯之優缺點 11 2. 6 青貯發酵過程 12 2. 7 青貯料常見問題 15 2. 8 青貯材料之細切程度 17 2. 9 青貯材料水分含量之調整 17 2. 10 青貯封裝應注意事項 18 2. 11 青貯品質評估 18 2. 12 青貯方式 23 第三章 材料與方法 28 3. 1 大型青割玉米太空包青貯自動化封裝系統設計概念 30 3. 2 小型青割玉米青貯封裝雛型機構想 33 3. 2. 1 壓板設計 33 3. 2. 2 封裝設計 36 3. 2. 3 小型青割玉米青貯封裝雛型機設計 41 3. 2. 4 作業程序控制系統 46 3. 3 物性試驗 47 3. 3. 1 青割玉米與塑膠袋之物性試驗裝置 48 3. 3. 2 青割玉米之相關物性試驗方法 51 3. 3. 3 塑膠袋之選用 56 3. 3. 4 塑膠袋相關物性試驗方法 58 3. 4 自動封裝測試 60 第四章 結果與討論 62 4. 1 小型青割玉米青貯封裝雛型機介紹 62 4. 2 物性試驗 65 4. 2. 1 含水率 66 4. 2. 2 細切長度 68 4. 2. 3 虛表比重 70 4. 2. 4 靜止角 70 4. 2. 5 摩擦係數 70 4. 2. 6 青貯料壓縮密度 71 4. 2. 7 發酵之溫度與膨脹壓力 73 4. 2. 8 塑膠袋之抗拉應力 75 4. 3 自動封裝測試 77 第五章 結論與建議 80 5. 1 結論 80 5. 2 建議 82 參考文獻 83 附錄 86 附錄 1 小型青割玉米青貯封裝雛型機PLC控制階梯圖 86 附錄 2 數據記錄器 (21 X-Data logger) 量測溫度之程式 91 附錄 3 聚乙烯薄膜特性 93 附錄 4 小型青割玉米青貯封裝雛型機細部機構圖 94 附錄 5 物性試驗數據 114 附錄 5. 1 青割玉米含水率(%) 114 附錄 5. 2 青割玉米細切長度（mm） 118 附錄 5. 3 青割玉米虛表比重 121 附錄 5. 4 青割玉米靜止角(°) 122 附錄 5. 5 青割玉米摩擦係數 123 附錄 5. 6 青割玉米壓縮比 125 附錄 5. 7 塑膠袋抗拉力 126 附錄 5. 8 塑膠袋熱封口抗拉力 12...|$|E

5000|$|... (1962): There are 3 {{different}} {{date stamps}} {{from this year}} in the United States, all with differences. By far the most desirable, and also the rarest, are the 3/62. These models are identical to the G3 Automatic Rifle except for having a swing-down semi-auto [...] "SE" [...] grip assembly. It was literally able to be converted to a full-auto G3 by changing the trigger group and bolt, no need to change the location of the push pin {{or any of the other}} features. They were all marked G3. This is why it is the most desirable of all semi-automatic G3s, and they are also incredibly rare with less than 3 known to exist in the United States (known as Santa Fe [...] "swing downs") still in semi-automatic form. Most were registered as full-auto hosts. Their value as full auto hosts is no more or less than any other G3, it is their value as a semi-automatic which is extremely high in comparison to other G3s, having sold on Gunbroker for over $20,000 on two occasions, matching the prices of full automatic G3s. It might be one of the only examples of a fully automatic transferrable that is valued the same whether or not it is in the registry. 7/62 is the second most common date from 1962, and like the March labeled guns was marked G3. However, the push pin hole was moved so that a full <b>automatic</b> trigger <b>pack</b> could NOT be installed without major machine work. They were stamped G3. The most common of 1962s are the 11/62, which is identical to the 7/62 except that part of the batch were labeled HK41s. They had the altered location of the push-pin hole, therefore requiring substantial work to turn into a fully automatic G3. There is a mix of G3 and HK41 markings among these date stamps. H&K changed their name to [...] "HK41" [...] in an attempt to stay ahead of West-German Laws which prohibited civilian ownership of the G3 Automatic Rifle.|$|R
30|$|Code {{obfuscation}} is {{a prominent}} technique used by hackers {{in order to}} avoid detection by security mechanisms (e.g., anti-viruses and intrusion detection systems) [35]. These techniques are also applied on benign software for copyrights protection purposes. Packing and compressing files can be achieved by using off-the-shelf packers such as Armadillo, UPX and Themida. In such cases, static analysis methods might fail to correctly classify a packed malware [36]. Several solutions to the challenge of packed code were suggested (e.g., Ether [36], McBoost [37], PolyUnpack [38]). These methods were proposed for <b>automatic</b> unpacking of <b>packed</b> files by applying either static or dynamic analysis. Evaluation performed in these studies showed that unpacking files before being classified increase the classification accuracy [37, 38]. Our proposed method can use such an approach in order to overcome packed files. In addition, we would {{like to point out that}} classifying benign files is also useful and can reduce the load of inspecting suspicious (or unknown) files. Also, the large number of malware files in our dataset that could be dissembled indicates that in order to appear benign and to pass security mechanisms (that are configured to block content that is encrypted and cannot be inspected), these techniques are not always used by hackers.|$|R

Magnet wire production became an especially vital component to the city's economy. In 1960, Fort Wayne {{was at the center}} of the United States magnet wire industry, home to New Haven Wire and Cable Company, Phelps Dodge, Rea Magnet Wire, Superior Essex, and an operation at General Electric, producing nearly 90 percent of North America's magnet wire.The 1970s and 1980s were times of economic depression in Fort Wayne, when much of the city's manufacturing foundation eroded and the blue-collar workforce shrank. Fort Wayne joined several other cities reeling economically within the Rust Belt. At the same time, General Electric also downsized much of its more than 10,000-person workforce. Amid other area plant closures and downsizing, coupled with the early 1980s recession, the city lost 30,000 jobs and reached a 12.1 percent unemployment rate. The arrival of General Motors in 1987 helped fill the void from shuttered manufacturers and aided in the area's recovery, employing 3,000 at its Fort Wayne Assembly.

These cars were meant only as prototypes. Broadspeed {{came up with a}} somewhat special solution, and used a combination of a Holset 3LDG turbocharger, and a carburettor mounted inside a big plenum chamber. The engine itself was fitted with a thicker copper head gasket, and as such the compression ratio was lowered to 7.6:1. The outcome was a 1.9-litre engine which generated , with acceleration of 0-60 in 7.6 seconds. All five cars were in GM's [...] "signalgelb" [...] sunflower yellow, and had large black stripes on the side, where a sign said [...] "Turbomanta". The downside to this was fuel consumption. The turbocharger had halved the economy of the car, and building it was also costly. Therefore Opel closed the project, leaving the five cars as the total production number. However a British engineer at the Dealer Opel Team (D.O.T.), which was the British importer and builder of Opel cars in Britain, was so enthusiastic about the cars that he had D.O.T. build an additional 28 cars. The cars were all based on the 1974 luxury Berlinetta model, with full gauge <b>packs,</b> <b>automatic</b> transmissions, and alloy wheels. All 28 cars were black with vinyl roofing. The only thing identifying that the car was indeed a Turbo Manta was a small sign at the rear quarter of the rear wings saying [...] "turbo". Very few of these cars still remain today.|$|R
