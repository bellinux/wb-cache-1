Patients received either 5 or 10 days of treatment (n = 177 in each group) with cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> at 250 mg twice daily or 10 days of treatment (n = 183) with amoxicillin-clavulanate at 500 mg three times daily. Patients in the cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> (5 days) group received placebo on days 6 to 10. Bacteriologic assessments were based on sputum specimen cultures obtained preceding and, when possible, following treatment. Organisms were isolated from the pretreatment sputum specimens of 242 of 537 (45 %) patients, with the primary pathogens being Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus (28, 25, 13, 9, and 8 % of isolates, respectively). Pathogens were eradicated or presumed to be eradicated in 87 % (52 of 60), 91 % (53 of 58), and 86 % (60 of 70) of bacteriologically evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> (5 days), cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> (10 days), and amoxicillin-clavulanate, respectively. A satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) was achieved in 82 % (107 of 130), 86 % (117 of 136), and 83 % (130 of 157) of the clinically evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> (5 days), cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> (10 days), and amoxicillin-clavulanate, respectively. Treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate was associated with a significantly higher incidence of drug-related adverse events than was treatment with cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> for either 5 or 10 days (P = 0. 001), primarily reflecting a higher incidence of drug-related gastrointestinal adverse events (37 versus 19 and 15 %, respectively; P < 0. 001), particularly diarrhea and nausea.

40|$|Cefuroxime is commercially {{available}} for parenteral administration as a sodium salt and for oral administration as cefuroxime <b>axetil,</b> the 1 -(acetoxy) ethyl ester of the drug. Cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> is a prodrug of cefuroxime and has little, if any, antibacterial activity until hydrolyzed in vivo to cefuroxime. In this study, {{the absorption of}} cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> in the small intestines of anesthetized rats was investigated in situ, by perfusion at four concentrations (11. 8, 5, 118 and 200 microM). Oral absorption of cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> can apparently {{be described as a}} specialized transport mechanism which obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Parameters characterizing absorption of prodrug in free solution were obtained: maximum rate of absorption (Vmax) = 289. 08 +/- 46. 26 microM h- 1, and Km = 162. 77 +/- 31. 17 microM. Cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> transport was significantly reduced {{in the presence of the}} enzymatic inhibitor sodium azide. On the other hand, the prodrug was metabolized in the gut wall through contact with membrane-bound enzymes in the brush border membrane before absorption occurred. This process reduces the prodrug fraction directly available for absorption. From a bioavailability point of view, therefore, the effects mentioned above can explain the variable and poor bioavailability following oral administration of cefuroxime <b>axetil.</b> Thus, future strategies in oral cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> absorption should focus on increasing the stability of the prodrug in the intestine by modifying the prodrug structure and/or targeting the compound to the absorption site...|$|E

Diagnosis was made on a range of clinical signs and symptoms combined with radiology and microbiology. A 400 mg dose of moxifloxacin was administered once daily for 7 days to 242 patients and 250 mg twice daily of cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> was administered to 251 patients for 10 days. The clinical success rate at the end of treatment in the evaluable population was significantly higher (96 · 7 %) in the moxifloxacin group (204 / 211) than in the cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> group (204 / 225, 90 · 7 %; 95 % confidence intervals 1 · 5 %; 10 · 6 %).

The most common drug-related adverse experiences were gastrointestinal events, reported by 8 % and 4 %, respectively, of the patients in the amoxycillin/clavulanate and cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> groups, a difference which was not statistically significant (P = 0. 32). These results indicate that cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> twice a day is as effective as amoxycillin/clavulanate three times a day in the treatment of outpatients with mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia...|$|E
40|$|Cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> (1. 5 g) was {{compared}} with amoxicillin (3 g), both given {{as a single}} oral dose combined with probenecid (1 g) {{for the treatment of}} uncomplicated gonorrhea. Of 60 evaluable patients receiving amoxicillin, 55 (91. 7 %) were cured, whereas 55 (96. 5 %) of the 57 patients receiving cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> were cured (P greater than 0. 1). Both drugs were well tolerated...|$|E
40|$|Cephalosporins, a {{class of}} beta lactam antibiotics, are {{frequently}} employed today {{in the treatment of}} infection. There is also an associated increase in the frequency of cephalosporin-related allergic reactions. A 31 -year-old woman presented to the emergency department with widespread rubor, nausea, shortness of breath and altered consciousness. The patient%u 2019 s symptoms had commenced half an hour after the oral ingestion of a drug containing 500 mg cefuroxime <b>axetil.</b> Drug-related anaphylactic shock was suspected.

40|$|Eighty-four {{children}} {{suffering from}} {{acute otitis media}} caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae were treated prospectively with cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> suspension (30 mg/kg of body weight twice daily for 8 days). The high incidence of isolates with decreased susceptibilities to penicillin (42 of 84 isolates) allowed us to establish a relationship between clinical success and the penicillin MICs for pneumococcal isolates. It was found that cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> is clinically effective {{in the treatment of}} acute otitis media caused by penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-intermediate strains of S. pneumoniae. The results indicate that the risk of treatment failure with cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> was increased in children with otitis media caused by S. pneumoniae when the penicillin MIC were {{greater than or equal to}} 2 mg/liter...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> {{were studied}} in 10 adult volunteers aged 24 to 31 years (mean age, 27), 22 {{infants and children}} aged 11 to 68 months (mean age, 33 months), and 11 children aged 7 years, 7 months to 12 years, 3 months (mean age, 11 years, 1 month). Mean peak plasma concentrations of cefuroxime occurred between 90 and 120 min in all study patients and were independent of the fasting or feeding status. The areas under the concentration-time curves were significantly higher in adult volunteers who received cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> with milk than in those who received the drug while fasting or with applesauce. The bioavailability of cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> was significantly enhanced in children by the concomitant ingestion of cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> and infant formula or whole milk. The areas under the concentration-time curves were 25 to 88 % higher when cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> and milk were administered simultaneously than when the same dose was given to all fasting patients. The plasma bactericidal activities of cefuroxime against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus {{at the time of}} peak plasma concentrations were independent of feeding status and were similar in adults and in children. Against these strains, 52 % of the children and 38 % of the adults had peak bactericidal levels of 1 : 8 or greater...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} preoperative intravenous flurbiprofen <b>axetil</b> and tramadol on spinal anesthesia for transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Methodology. In this prospective clinical study, we enrolled 60 patients undergoing TURP under spinal anesthesia with small-dose bupivacaine and sufentanil. Patients were randomly divided in two: group flurbiprofen <b>axetil</b> and tramadol (Group FT) intravenously received 1 [*]mg/kg flurbiprofen <b>axetil</b> and 1 [*]mg/kg tramadol 20 [*]min prior to the surgical procedures and group control (Group C) was given normal saline. The characteristics of spinal anesthesia, blood pressure, heart rate, analgesic requirement, visual analogue scale (VAS), and overall satisfaction degree were collected. Results. Time to the first analgesic requirement was significantly longer in Group FT. Patients who needed postoperative analgesics were fewer in Group FT. VAS scores were lower in Group FT at postoperative time points of 1, 2, 6, and 12 [*]h. The patients in Group FT were more satisfied than in Group C. Conclusions. Preoperative flurbiprofen <b>axetil</b> and tramadol can reduce and delay postoperative pain and then decrease analgesic consumption for TURP under spinal anesthesia without an increase of side effects...|$|E
40|$|Cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> {{is a new}} orally absorbed prodrug of the {{antibiotic}} cefuroxime. The results of pharmacological studies in 52 healthy volunteers are presented. Intact cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> was not detected in the systemic circulation, indicating that deesterification to yield cefuroxime occurs rapidly after absorption. The bioavailability as measured by urinary recovery of cefuroxime was 40 to 50 % if the drug was taken after food and 30 % if the drug was taken after overnight fasting. Absorption was similar for three different formulations at 500 mg and independent of dose over the range of 250 mg to 1 g. When the drug was taken after food, serum levels and urinary recoveries were significantly greater for cefuroxime than for ampicillin, but when the drug was taken after fasting the values were similar for the two drugs. The kinetic behavior of cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> and ampicillin was not influenced by repeated dosing at 250 mg. Cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> was well tolerated. Although changes in bowel flora and habit were noted during repeated dosing, these changes were no greater than with ampicillin...|$|E
40|$|Cefuroxime <b>axetil,</b> the orally active prodrug of {{cefuroxime}} is {{marketed as}} a 1 : 1 mixture of two diastereomers designated as R (1 'R, 6 R, 7 R) and S (1 'S, 6 R, 7 R). Prodrug hydrolysis {{is thought to}} occur during intestinal absorption, however little is known concerning the relative availability of cefuroxime from each isomeric form. The Caco- 2 cell monolayer model {{was used to examine}} the possible stereoselectivity of absorption by measuring the accumulation and epithelial transport rate in the apical to basolateral direction of cefuroxime and cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> following application of the mixture (1. 0 mM) or individual diastereomers (0. 5 mM 0 of cefuroxime <b>axetil.</b> Cefuroxime appearance in the basolateral chamber was in the order: mixture > R > S following application of the prodrug. The accumulation of unchanged cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> was S > R irrespective of the form applied, i. e. individual diastereomer or the mixture. Such stereoselective differences in both absorption and/or hydrolysis may contribute to the observed oral bioavailability (30 - 50 %) of cefuroxime in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} {{of single}} doses of cefaclor at 250 and 375 mg and cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> at 250 mg administered under optimal conditions (i. e., cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> after food and cefaclor in the fasted state) were studied in 24 healthy male volunteers. Drug concentrations in serum {{were related to}} MICs for common respiratory tract pathogens by using data generated from a recently completed national survey. The time the concentrations in serum exceeded the MICs for Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella (formerly Branhamella) catarrhalis were significantly greater (P less than 0. 05) for cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> at 250 mg than for cefaclor at 250 or 375 mg. With the recommended dosing regimens (cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> at 250 mg and cefaclor at 375 mg twice daily or cefaclor at 250 mg three times daily), cefuroxime concentrations exceed the MIC for 90 % of the strains tested for a greater time period than cefaclor concentrations with either regimen. The reasons for this difference are (i) the greater potency and slower clearance of cefuroxime {{compared with those of}} cefaclor and (ii) the greater sensitivity of these pathogens to cefuroxime...|$|E
40|$|Five hundred ninety {{patients}} {{were enrolled in}} a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial comparing the efficacy and safety of 7 to 14 days of levofloxacin treatment with that of ceftriaxone and/or cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> {{in the management of}} community-acquired pneumonia in adults. Patients received either intravenous and/or oral levofloxacin (500 mg once daily) or the comparative agents, parenteral ceftriaxone (1 to 2 g once to twice daily) and/or oral cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> (500 mg twice daily). Erythromycin or doxycycline could be added to the comparator arm at the investigator's discretion. The decision to use an intravenous or oral antimicrobial agent for initial therapy was made by the investigator. Clinical and microbiological evaluations were completed at the baseline, during treatment, 5 to 7 days posttherapy, and 3 to 4 weeks posttherapy. Four hundred fifty-six patients (226 given levofloxacin and 230 administered ceftriaxone and/or cefuroxime <b>axetil)</b> were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were isolated in 15 and 12 %, respectively, of clinically evaluable patients. One hundred fifty atypical pathogens were identified: 101 were Chlamydia pneumoniae, 41 were Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and 8 were Legionella pneumophila. Clinical success at 5 to 7 days posttherapy was superior for the levofloxacin group (96 %) compared with the ceftriaxone and/or cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> group (90 %) (95 % confidence interval [CI] of - 10. 7 to - 1. 3). Among patients with typical respiratory pathogens who were evaluable for microbiological efficacy, the overall bacteriologic eradication rates were superior for levofloxacin (98 %) compared with the ceftriaxone and/or cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> group (85 %) (95 % CI of - 21. 6 to - 4. 8). Levofloxacin eradicated 100 % of the most frequently reported respiratory pathogens (i. e., H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae) and provided a > 98 % clinical success rate in patients with atypical pathogens. Both levofloxacin and ceftriaxone-cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> eradicated 100 % of the S. pneumoniae cells detected in blood culture. Drug-related adverse events were reported in 5. 8 % of patients receiving levofloxacin and in 8. 5 % of patients administered ceftriaxone and/or cefuroxime <b>axetil.</b> Gastrointestinal and central and peripheral nervous system adverse events were the most common events reported in each treatment group. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that treatment with levofloxacin is superior to ceftriaxone and/or cefuroxime <b>axetil</b> therapy in the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults...|$|E
