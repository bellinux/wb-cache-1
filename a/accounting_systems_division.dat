40|$|Corporate {{accounting}} information is sometimes organized in separate processing centers, each one providing a specific kind of information. In France, for instance, {{as in many}} other European countries, there are often three separate data processing centers: financial accounting, management accounting and cash flow accounting. In the United States, it would appear that such a separation between financial accounting and cash flow accounting also exists. The FASB (1987, § 109) recognizes that many providers of financial statements do not presently collect information in a manner {{that will allow them to}} determine amounts such as cash receipts and payments directly from their <b>accounting</b> <b>systems.</b> These <b>divisions</b> and dispersals of information entail laborious reconciliation and analysis work, reducing considerably the efficiency of accounting as a management tool. Data processing has overcome these obstacles clearing the way for a more advanced bookkeeping technique: the Unified <b>Accounting</b> <b>System</b> (UAS), which helps to eliminate divisions and dispersals and take optimum advantage of the available resources. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the Unified <b>Accounting</b> <b>System</b> which unifies all th...|$|R

I then develop the idea of a financial reporting system as a "network", with the <b>accounting</b> <b>system</b> providing the standards that determine the compatibility between the components of the network. Using this framework, I show the pluses and minuses of a single <b>accounting</b> <b>system</b> versus multiple <b>accounting</b> <b>systems</b> and illustrate the current "systems competition " among national securities markets and their <b>accounting</b> <b>systems.</b> Though a single <b>accounting</b> <b>system</b> decreases comparability costs and thereby encourages globalization, while multiple <b>accounting</b> <b>systems</b> increase comparability costs and thereby impede globalization, those multiple <b>accounting</b> <b>systems</b> also permit national adaptation to national circumstances and permit greater opportunities for experimentation and innovation.

It also discusses the effects of the program on Ground <b>Systems</b> <b>Division</b> and the cognizant Defense Plant Representative Office and the program's ideal strategy. The research demonstrates that critical process improvements at Ground <b>Systems</b> <b>Division</b> were attained through the overwhelming commitment of the Ground <b>Systems</b> <b>Division</b> and the Defense Plant Representative Office.

Economy and accounting are two vital parts for a municipality and it requires an <b>accounting</b> <b>system</b> that meets a municipality's requirements and expectations. The <b>accounting</b> <b>system</b> should work like a gear through the municipality and provide it with financial information. The purpose of the <b>accounting</b> <b>system</b> {{is to create a}} valuable basis for decisions the municipality takes. There are today few studies of financial manager’s views and demands for <b>accounting</b> <b>system</b> in a municipality. Science of accounting considers that the problematic of choosing <b>accounting</b> <b>systems</b> is a big question mark. A direct consequence of the limited research in the area is that the decision-makers in municipalities lack support for in the procurement process of financial systems. This study aims to describe and analyze the demands CFOs in the municipalities have on their <b>accounting</b> <b>systems.</b> The identified requirements will be used as basis for selection of an appropriate <b>accounting</b> <b>system</b> for the municipalities. Neo-institutional theory {{has been used as a}} theoretical framework for connecting the objective and empirical data of the study to the analysis and conclusion. A qualitative study has been conducted on 15 chief financial officers in their respective municipalities. The study was designed as semi-structured interviews where the contact took place by telephone. In the interview CFOs expressed different requirements which they felt were important. This study was able to identify the requirements on the <b>accounting</b> <b>systems</b> in the municipalities. The results of the study show that a user-friendly system was the most dominant requirement of an <b>accounting</b> <b>system.</b> The theoretical contribution of the study is that the requirements of an <b>accounting</b> <b>system</b> from the private sector also can be applied to the public sector.
