25|$|The early {{sculptures of}} Jacques Lipchitz, 1911-1912, were {{conventional}} portraits and figure studies executed {{in the tradition}} of Aristide Maillol and Charles Despiau. He progressively turned toward Cubism in 1914 with periodic reference to Negro sculpture. His 1915 Baigneuse is comparable to figures from Gabun. In 1916 his figures became more abstract, though less so than those of Brâncuși's sculptures of 1912-1915. Lipchitz' Baigneuse <b>Assise</b> (70.5cm) of 1916 is clearly reminiscent of Csaky's 1913 Figure de Femme Debout, 1913 (Figure Habillée) (80cm), exhibited in Paris at the Salon des Indépendants in the spring of 1913, with the same architectonic rendering of the shoulders, head, torso, and lower body, both with an angular pyramidal, cylidrical and spherical geometric armature. Just as some of the works of Picasso and Braque of the period are virtually indistinguishable, so too are Csaky's and Lipchitz sculptures, only Csaky's predates that of Lipchitz by three years.|$|E

The fee extends between the Cullahill Mountains to the east of side of the river Nore at Ballyragget, and borders on the southwest with Philip de Rocheford’s lands in the parish of Sheffin, and on the south with the monks of Jerpoint in Grangemacomb. It also possessed the common of pasture and woods in Odogh. It was witnessed by two of his other sons: Richard Devereux, and Warin Devereux. Donoughmore lies {{on the east side of}} the river Nore at Ballyragget with the fee of Donoughmore extending along the west bank, and the five carucates taking in the ancient parish of Achteyr alias Aharney.|$|E

2500|$|In 1939, Fondane was {{naturalized}} French. This {{followed an}} independent {{initiative of the}} Société des écrivains français professional association, in recognition for his contribution to French letters. Cahiers du Sud collected the required 3,000 francs fee through a public subscription, enlisting particularly large contributions from music producer Renaud de Jouvenel (brother of Bertrand de Jouvenel) and philosopher-ethnologist Lucien Lévy-Bruhl. Only months after this event, with the outbreak of World War II, Fondane was drafted into the French Army. During most of the [...] "Phoney War" [...] interval, considered too old for active service, {{he was in the}} military reserve force, but in February 1940 was called under arms with the 216 Artillery Regiment. According to Lina, [...] "he left [...] with unimaginable courage and faith." [...] Stationed at the Sainte <b>Assise</b> Castle in Seine-Port, he edited and stenciled a humorous gazette, L'Écho de la I C-ie ("The 1st Company Echo"), where he also published his last-ever work of poetry, Le poète en patrouille ("The Poet on Patrolling Duty").|$|E
2500|$|In Italy, a Civil law jurisdiction, untrained {{judges are}} present {{only in the}} Corte d'Assise, where two career magistrates are {{supported}} by six so-called Lay Judges, who are raffled from the registrar of voters. Any Italian citizen, with no distinction of sex or religion, between 30 and 65 years of age, can be appointed as a lay judge; {{in order to be}} eligible as a lay judge for the Corte d'Assise, however, there is a minimum educational requirement, as the lay judge must have completed his/her education at the Scuola Media (junior high school) level, while said level is raised for the Corte d'Assise d'Appello (appeal level of the Corte d'Assise) to the Scuola Superiore (senior high school) degree. In the Corte d'Assise, decisions concerning both fact and law matters are taken by the stipendiary judges and [...] "Lay Judges" [...] together at a special meeting behind closed doors, named Camera di Consiglio ("Counsel Chamber"), and the Court is subsequently required to publish written explanations of its decisions within 90 days from the verdict. Errors of law or inconsistencies in the explanation of a decision can and usually will lead to the annulment of the decision. A Court d'Assise and a Court d' <b>Assise</b> d'Appello decides on a majority of votes, and therefore predominantly on the votes of the lay judges, who are a majority of six to two, but in fact [...] lay judges, who are not trained to write such explanation and must rely on one or the other stipendiary judge to do it, are effectively prevented from overruling both of them. [...] The Corte d'Assise has jurisdiction to try crimes carrying a maximum penalty of 24 years in prison or life imprisonment, and other serious crimes; felonies that fall under its jurisdiction include terrorism, murder, manslaughter, severe attempts against State personalities, as well as some matters of law requiring ethical and professional evaluations (ex. assisted suicide), while it generally has no jurisdiction over cases whose evaluation requires knowledge of Law which the [...] "Lay Judges" [...] generally don't have. Penalties imposed by the court can include life sentences.|$|E
