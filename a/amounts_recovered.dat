These single copy sequences included about {{one third of the}} total nonrepetitive sequence in the genome as determined by the <b>amounts</b> <b>recovered</b> during the hydroxyapatite fractionation and by reassociation kinetics. 3 H-labeled mRNA from sea urchin gastrula was prepared by puromycin release from polysomes and used in DNA-driven hybridization reactions.

The mRNA hybridized with excess repeat-contiguous DNA with similar kinetics relative to the driver DNA. At completion 80 % of that mRNA hybridizable with whole DNA (approximately 65 %) had reacted with the repeat-contiguous DNA fraction (50 %).

40|$|The {{formation}} of cysts by Azotobacter vinelandii involves {{the synthesis of}} lipids as major metabolic products. Cells which encyst at low levels in aging glucose cultures undergo {{the same pattern of}} lipid synthesis as cells which undergo reasonably synchronous encystment in beta-hydroxybutyrate or n-butanol. The accumulation of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) precedes the synthesis of 5 -n-heneicosylresorcinol and 5 -n-tricosylresorcinol (AR 1), which is then followed in about 6 h by the synthesis of the 5 -n-alkylresorcinol galactosides (AR 2). In the mature cyst, PHB, AR 1, and AR 2 account for 8, 5. 6, and 4. 5 %, respectively, of the dry weight. Phospholipid formation levels off 4 h postinduction, which coincides with the final cell division, but fatty acids synthesis continues at a very low level throughout encystment, suggesting some turnover of fatty acid. Distribution studies show that AR 1 and AR 2 are found in roughly equal amounts in the exine and central body of the cysts, with only trace <b>amounts</b> <b>recovered</b> from the intine. Studies of cysts labeled during encystment with [14 C]beta-hydroxybutyrate or during vegetative growth with [14 C]glucose suggest that the exine structure is synthesized during encystment, but that the intine is composed largely of vegetative cell components...|$|E

Since fungicides do not move basipetally, they are effective only when fungitoxic concentrations are delivered to the rhizosphere. This research focused {{on the distribution of}} modern fungicides in verdure, thatch, sand, and roots of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L. var. palustris (Huds.) Farw.) maintained as a putting green. Fungicides (azoxystrobin (methyl (E) - 2 -[2 -[6 -(2 -cyanophenoxy) pyrimidin- 4 -yloxy]phenyl]- 3 -methoxyacrylate), propiconazole (1, 2, 4 -Triazole, 1 -((2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 4 -propyl- 1, 3 -dioxolan- 2 -yl) methyl), pyraclostrobin (carbamic acid, [2 -[[[1 -(4 -chlorophenyl) - 1 H-pyrazol- 3 -yl]oxy]methyl]phenyl]methoxy-,methyl ester), and thiophanate-methyl (dimethyl 4, 42 ̆ 7 -o-phenylenebis[3 -thioallophanate]) were applied to replicate field plots in a water volume of 815 L ha- 1. Plots were sampled over time (0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21 days after application) by extracting cores measuring 2 cm diameter by 3. 8 cm deep. Cores were separated into verdure/thatch, sand, and roots before quantitative determination (liquid chromatography, triple quadrupole mass spectrometry) of fungicide residues. Fungicide residues in verdure/thatch declined steadily with time and support previously reported results describing fungicide depletion. Fungicides were detected in roots and sand within 5 hours of application, although at very low (1 - 15 ppm) concentrations. Residues in roots and sand remained at low levels throughout the experiment. Fungicides differed with respect to <b>amounts</b> <b>recovered</b> per turfgrass component. ...|$|E

The duplicate–diet approach {{was used for the}} assessment of fluoride intake from solid and liquid foods. Fluoride intake from toothbrushing was calculated as the difference between the amount of fluoride in the paste put on the toothbrush and the drinking water (fluoride concentration 0. 25 mg/l) used for rinsing vs. the fluoride <b>amounts</b> <b>recovered</b> in the toothpaste spat out and in the rinsing water. Use of fluoridated domestic salt and/or fluoride tablets was recorded. The children’s intake of fluoride from food averaged 202. 5 ± 116. 2 μg F/day.

30|$|Nigeria records a {{low level}} of {{financial}} inclusion, which culminated in the adoption of a national financial inclusion strategy to achieve a 70 % inclusion by the year 2020. The World Bank (2000) estimated that the Nigerian Agricultural Co-Operative Bank, The Peoples Bank of Nigeria, and community banks could only reach less than 10 % of the rural population during their total existence. Further, Ajakaiye (2013) indicates that only 30 % of Nigerian adults have an account with formal financial institutions. Farmers in Delta State as with many other states in Nigeria with microfinance institutions and group lending schemes still cite the lack of adequate credit as one constraint to increased agricultural production, (Mbah, 2009; Afolabi, 2010; Eyo and Enimu 2015; Enimu, Igiri and Uduma, 2015). However, micro-financial institutions activities are a good source of financing resources, as constrained poor farmers abound these activities should benefit the farmers as well as the nation in its quest for financial inclusion. Regarding a formal-informal sector linkage, group performance in meeting the group’s financial obligations to the partner bank {{is a function of the}} group member’s ability to repay group loans. Invariably, loan beneficiaries’ inability to repay their loans makes it impossible for the lenders to meet their other clients’ demands, thereby negatively impacting outreach and financial inclusion. More over, for the credit system to function, both effectively and efficiently, it is important that a default in repayment is as rare as possible, as the agencies’ viability highly depends on the loan <b>amounts</b> <b>recovered.</b>|$|E
40|$|A single {{intradermal}} {{injection of}} the adjuvant-oil squalene induces T cell-mediated arthritis in DA rats. The {{chain of events}} leading from non-specific provocation {{of the immune system}} to arthritis, with clinical similarities to rheumatoid arthritis, is largely undetermined. Here, we combined in vivo tracking of tritium-labelled squalene with lymph node (LN) cell transfer experiments to determine where critical activation events may take place. The majority of squalene remained at the injection site (79 %). The <b>amounts</b> <b>recovered</b> in peripheral joints (< 1 %) were equal to that recovered in other organs that can be targets in autoimmune diseases. This argues that arthritis does not develop as a consequence of adjuvant accumulation in joints. In contrast, substantial amounts of squalene were recovered in hyperplastic LN draining the injection site (1 – 13 %). The adjuvant was deposited to a larger extent in cells than in extracellular matrix. The draining LN cells could transfer arthritis to naïve irradiated DA rats following in vitro stimulation with conA. Interestingly, non-draining LN were also hyperplastic and harboured arthritogenic cells, although they contained low amounts of squalene (< 1 %). Consequently, the amount of arthritogenic adjuvant in a particular LN is not closely linked to the development of pathogenic cells. The distribution pattern of squalene was similar in MHC-identical but arthritis-resistant PVG. 1 AV 1 and LEW. 1 AV 1 rats, and it was unaffected by T cell depletion with a monoclonal antibody (R 73). Thus, T cells and non-MHC genes do not regulate dissemination of squalene, but rather determine arthritis development at the level of adjuvant response...|$|E

The isolates were screened for {{the ability to}} grow anaerobically in liquid culture with naphthalene as the sole source of carbon and energy {{in the presence of}} nitrate. Three naphthalenedegrading pure cultures were obtained, designated NAP- 3 - 1, NAP- 3 - 2, and NAP- 4. Isolate NAP- 3 - 1 tested positive for denitrification using a standard denitrification assay. Neither isolate NAP- 3 - 2 nor isolate NAP- 4 produced gas in the assay, but both consumed nitrate and NAP- 4 produced significant amounts of nitrite. Isolates NAP- 4 and NAP- 3 - 1 transformed 70 to 90 % of added naphthalene, and the transformation was nitrate dependent. No significant removal of naphthalene occurred under nitrate-limited conditions or in cell-free controls. Both cultures exhibited partial mineralization of naphthalene, representing 7 to 20 % of the initial added 14 C-labeled naphthalene. After 57 days of incubation, the largest fraction of the radiolabel in both cultures was recovered in the cell mass (30 to 50 %), with minor <b>amounts</b> <b>recovered</b> as unknown soluble metabolites. Nitrate consumption, along with the results from the 14 C radiolabel study, are consistent with the oxidation of naphthalene coupled to denitrification for NAP- 3 - 1 and nitrate reduction to nitrite for NAP- 4.

However, information regarding absorption, metabolism, and especially, tissue distribution {{are only beginning to}} accumulate. In the present study, we investigated the occurrence and the kinetics of various circulating pelargonidin metabolites, and we aimed at providing initial information with regard to tissue distribution. Based on HPLC and LC-MS analyses we demonstrate that pelargonidin is absorbed and present in plasma following oral gavage to rats. In addition, the main structurally related pelargonidin metabolite identified in plasma and urine was pelargonidin glucuronide. Furthermore, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, a ring fission product of pelargonidin, was detected in plasma and urine samples obtained at 2 and 18 h after ingestion. At 2 h post-gavage, pelargonidin glucuronide was the major metabolite detected in kidney and liver, with levels reaching 0. 5 and 0. 15 nmol pelargonidin equivalents/g tissue, respectively. Brain and lung tissues contained detectable levels of the aglycone, with the glucuronide also present in the lungs. Other tissues, including spleen and heart, did not contain detectable levels of pelargonidin or ensuing metabolites. At 18 h post-gavage, tissue analyses did not reveal detectable levels of the aglycone nor of pelargonidin glucuronides. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the overall uptake of the administered pelargonidin was 18 % after 2 h, with the majority of the detected levels located in the stomach. However, the <b>amounts</b> <b>recovered</b> dropped to 1. 2 % only 18 h post-gavage, with the urine and faecal content constituting almost 90 % of the total recovered pelargonidin...|$|E
40|$|Although ground stone {{artifacts}} {{comprise a}} substantial portion of the archaeological record, their use as an important source of information about the past has remained underdeveloped. This is especially true for milling tools (mortars, pestles, grinding slabs and handstones) used by hunter-gatherers. Three studies that apply novel techniques and approaches to prehistoric milling technology are presented here. Together they demonstrate that substantial opportunities exist for new avenues of inquiry in the study of these artifacts. The first combines a simple optimization model from behavioral ecology with experimental data to weigh manufacturing costs against gains in grinding efficiency for mobile hunter-gatherers. Results run counter to widespread assumptions that mobile hunter-gatherers should not spend time shaping grinding surfaces on milling tools. Next, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is used to analyze lipid preservation in modified rock features in dry caves at Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument, New Mexico. A high concentration of lipids, derived from processing a seed resource, was recovered from a grinding surface in these caves. The lipid content in this surface is comparable to <b>amounts</b> <b>recovered</b> from select pottery sherds that have been used for radiocarbon dating. The third study uses synchronic and diachronic variability in morphology, use-wear, and symbolic content to analyze ground stone milling tools from mortuary contexts in the San Francisco Bay Area of California.

By contrast, GM-CSF was only detectable (greater than 0. 5 U/uterus) in the luminal fluid of three of 22 unmated oestrous mice examined. No activity was detected in secretions from male accessory glands including seminal vesicle, epididymis, prostate and coagulating gland (less than 0. 5 U/gland). GM-CSF was found at higher levels in supernatants from cell monolayers prepared by tryptic digest of the uteri of Day 1 mated mice than those from unmated oestrous mice (P less than 0. 05). Little GM-CSF was detected in supernatants from ovariectomized mice. An alpha-GM-CSF polyvalent antibody neutralized the FD 5 / 12 bioassay response confirming the identity of the lymphokine. The interleukins IL- 2 and IL- 3 were not detected in uterine luminal fluid nor in media conditioned by cell monolayers.
