25|$|Alcohol fuels, {{including}} butanol and ethanol, are partially oxidized {{and therefore}} {{need to run}} at richer mixtures than gasoline. Standard gasoline engines in cars can adjust the <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> to accommodate variations in the fuel, but only within certain limits depending on model. If the limit is exceeded by running the engine on pure ethanol or a gasoline blend with {{a high percentage of}} ethanol, the engine will run lean, something which can critically damage components. Compared to ethanol, butanol can be mixed in higher ratios with gasoline for use in existing cars without the need for retrofit as the <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> and energy content are closer to that of gasoline.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{carburetor}} {{leaves a}} stable condition, the float {{is influenced by}} both gravity and inertia, resulting in inaccurate fuel metering {{and a reduction in}} engine performance as the <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> changes, becoming either too lean or too rich for maximum engine performance, and in some cases, stopping the engine.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} intercoolers, it is common practice to add extra fuel to the intake air (known as [...] "running an engine rich") {{for the sole purpose of}} cooling. The amount of extra fuel varies, but typically reduces the <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> to between 11 and 13, instead of the stoichiometric 14.7 (in petrol engines). The extra fuel is not burned (as there is insufficient oxygen to complete the chemical reaction), instead it undergoes a phase change from atomized (liquid) to gas. This phase change absorbs heat, and the added mass of the extra fuel reduces the average thermal energy of the charge and exhaust gas. Even when a catalytic converter is used, the practice of running an engine rich increases exhaust emissions.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the high}} {{centrifugal}} forces encountered during drifting, drivers are usually retained by a racing seat and five-point harness. This allows the hands to merely turn the wheel, instead of bracing {{the body in the}} seat. The same applies for the feet, which are free to move rapidly between clutch, brake and accelerator pedals. The steering wheel is usually relatively small, dished, and perfectly round, {{so that it can be}} released and allowed to spin through the hands as the caster returns the front wheels to center. The locking knob on the hand brake is usually replaced with a spin turn knob; this stops the hand brake locking on when pulled. Nearly all drivers move the hand brake location or add an extra hydraulic hand brake actuator for greater braking force.

2500|$|The {{shape of}} the Wankel {{combustion}} chamber is more resistant to preignition operating on lower-octane rating gasoline than a comparable piston engine. The combustion chamber shape may also lead to relatively incomplete combustion of the air-fuel charge. This {{would result in a}} larger amount of unburned hydrocarbons released into the exhaust. The exhaust is, however, relatively low in NOx emissions, because combustion temperatures are lower than in other engines, and also because of some inherent exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in early engines. Sir Harry Ricardo showed in the 1920s that for every 1% increase in the proportion of exhaust gas in the admission mix, there is a 7°C reduction in flame temperature. This allowed Mazda to meet the United States Clean Air Act of 1970 in 1973, with a simple and inexpensive [...] "thermal reactor", which was an enlarged chamber in the exhaust manifold. By decreasing the <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio,</b> unburned hydrocarbons (HC) in the exhaust would support combustion in the thermal reactor. Piston-engine cars required expensive catalytic converters to deal with both unburned hydrocarbons and NOx emissions. This inexpensive solution increased fuel consumption, which was already a weak point for the Wankel engine, and the oil crisis of 1973 raised the price of gasoline. Toyota discovered that injection of air into the exhaust port zone improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. The best results were obtained with holes in the side plates; doing it in the exhaust duct had no noticeable influence. The use of a three-stage catalysts, with air supplied in the middle, as for two-stroke piston engines, also proved beneficial.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{gasoline}} and {{liquefied petroleum gas}} engines, diesel engines do not use high-voltage spark ignition (spark plugs). An engine running on diesel compresses the air inside the cylinder to high pressures and temperatures (compression ratios from 14:1 to 18:1 are common in current diesel engines); the engine generally injects the diesel fuel directly into the cylinder, starting a few degrees {{before top dead center}} (TDC) and continuing during the combustion event. The high temperatures inside the cylinder cause the diesel fuel to react with the oxygen in the mix (burn or oxidize), heating and expanding the burning mixture to convert the thermal/pressure difference into mechanical work, i.e., to move the piston. [...] Engines have glow plugs and grid heaters to help start the engine by preheating the cylinders to a minimum operating temperature. Diesel engines are lean burn engines, burning the fuel in more air than is needed for the chemical reaction. [...] They thus use less fuel than rich burn spark ignition engines which use a stoichiometric <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> (just enough air to react with the fuel). As Professor Harvey of the University of Toronto notes, [...] "due to the absence of throttling , and the high compression ratio and lean fuel mixture, diesel engines are substantially more efficient than spark-ignited engines", generally; Harvey cites the side-by-side comparisons of Schipper et al. and the estimates of >20% lower fuel use and (given differences in energy content between fuel types) >15% lower energy use. Gas turbine and some other types of internal combustion engines, and external combustion engine, both can also be designed to take diesel fuel.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, stricter {{regulations}} on emissions and higher demands for more fuel efficient vehicles {{have led to}} a greater focus on increasing the efficiency of the internal combustion engine. Nowadays, there is increasing interest in the recovery of waste heat from different engine sources such as the coolant and exhaust gases using, for example, a Rankine cycle. In diesel engines 15 % to 30 % of the energy from the fuel can be lost to the coolant and hence, does not contribute to producing work on the piston. This paper looks at reducing the heat losses to the coolant by increasing coolant temperatures within a single cylinder Scania D 13 engine and studying the effects of this on the energy balance within the engine as well as the combustion characteristics. To do this, a GT Power model was first validated against experimental data from the engine. Using a Water-PEG mixture as coolant, the coolant temperature was then varied from 60 °C to 200 °C for both the liner and the cylinderhead. This sweep was done for multiple combinations of engine loads and speeds as well as for different <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratios.</b> It was found that at the higher <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratios,</b> an increase in coolant temperature led to an increase in indicated efficiency as well as an increase in exhaust gas temperature and enthalpy. However at lower <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratios</b> there is a decrease in indicated efficiency with higher coolant temperatures. It was also seen that ignition delay at higher temperatures was shorter with the combustion duration being longer. The change in combustion phasing was found to be dependent on engine load. While the higher coolant temperature simplifies heat recovery from the coolant itself, the consequently higher exhaust gas temperatures observed means that the heat losses are moved more towards the exhaust where energy recovery is easier...|$|R

40|$|This work {{extends the}} {{analyses}} of two experimental {{studies that have}} been performed on the UMD supersonic test facility. The effects of convective Mach number and <b>air-fuel</b> density <b>ratio</b> have been investigated numerically in non-swirling and swirling underexpanded airflows with coaxial fuel injection. The axial variation of swirl number within subsonic, transonic, and supersonic regions of flowfield has been examined. It was found that transonic flows experience considerable reduction in swirl number, which is attributed mainly to a significant increase in axial momentum during transition. In contrast, the tangential momentum associated with swirl showed almost no change during transition. A non-swirling central fuel jet was found to induce an overall reduction in supersonic swirl number. The degree of reduction was found to be almost proportional to the decrease in convective Mach number. The shear angle between fuel and air streams was found to depend on fuel compressibility and <b>air-fuel</b> density <b>ratio.</b> Incompressible fuel jets and/or high <b>air-fuel</b> density <b>ratios</b> result in negative shear angles, which transition to positive if the fuel jet becomes compressible or the <b>air-fuel</b> density <b>ratio</b> decreases.
