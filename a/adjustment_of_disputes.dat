[...] A marriage alliance between Prussia and Hanover was regarded as a noncontroversial choice by both courts and the negotiations was swiftly conducted. In order for Sophia Dorothea to make such a good impression as possible in Berlin, Electress Sophia commissioned her niece Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess of the Palatinate to procure her trousseau in Paris, and her bridal paraphernalia attracted great attention and was referred to as the greatest of any German Princess yet.|$|R

At length some sort of settlement was made, and both armies agreed to retire. Pyrrhus, however, had no intention of keeping his agreement. Having thrown the people of the city somewhat off their guard by his promise, he took occasion to advance stealthily to one of the gates at dead of night, and there, the gate being opened to him by a confederate within the city, he began to march his soldiers in. The troops were ordered to keep silence, and to step noiselessly, and thus a large body of Gauls gained admission, and posted themselves in the market-place without alarming or awakening the inhabitants. To render this story credible, we must suppose that the sentinels and guards had been previously gained over to Pyrrhus's side.|$|R

40|$|While much {{attention}} has been given to reputation mechanisms to deter fraudulent behavior in online auctions, we know little about the nature <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> or the types of problems that users face. This is an exploratory analysis <b>of</b> 129 <b>disputes</b> for six different types of products that were sold on eBay. In the descriptive and multinomial analysis, we find eight different types <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> including poor quality, slow shipping, seller withdrawal, failure to ship the product, fraud, poor communications, misunderstanding, and non-paying bidders. Of these the most common types <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> were poor communications, non-paying bidders and item quality. In the most serious <b>disputes</b> <b>of</b> fraud and no shipment where the seller is at fault the reputation ratings are much lower than the ratings for other disputes related to sellers. Similarly for buyers, the reputation ratings for the most serious <b>disputes</b> <b>of</b> non-paying bidders are considerably lower than those of other types <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> related to buyers. This implies that analysis of reputation ratings is of some value in reducing the probability <b>of</b> <b>dispute.</b> <b>Of</b> the types of payments methods in eBay auctions personal checks show the greatest number <b>of</b> <b>disputes.</b> Auction sites may wish to discourage sellers from accepting this type of payment. ...|$|R
