Eventually he teamed up with Garry Meier to cohost the highly successful Roe & Garry Show. In 2004, amid an impasse in contract negotiations with the station, Meier did not renew his contract with WLS. Roe then became the sole host of the show, which also featured Jim Johnson and Christina Filiaggi. Many praise Roe Conn for having <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and for being skilled at articulating his thoughts. In the spring 2006 ratings period, The Roe Conn Show became Chicago’s most listened-to radio talk show among adults.|$|E

One of his favorite jokes, which he delivered in a speech {{on the eve of his}} departure for Washington D.C. to become vice president, recounted a story of a man with two sons.

500|$|Martin Kaste, South America {{correspondent}} for National Public Radio, reported on April 9, 2002 that since their announcement {{that they were}} going to sue Fox, the Riotur officials had been told by their lawyers in the United States that it would be difficult to sue the episode there because of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which protects parodies. The Simpsons executive producer James L. Brooks soon issued a statement saying: [...] "We apologize to the lovely city and people of Rio de Janeiro. And if that doesn't settle the issue, Homer Simpson offers to take on the president of Brazil on Fox's Celebrity Boxing." [...] Spokespersons for Fox told the press that they had not received nearly as much criticism with previous episodes that poked fun at other nations. Showrunner Al Jean has said in an interview that [...] "Every other place has had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b> Brazil caught us by surprise."

500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 79, based on 24 professional critic reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews".

[...] Tim Karan of Alternative Press called The Black Parade [...] "MCR's whole raison d'etre rolled up into one mega-decibel calling card". Ed Thompson of IGN stated, [...] "The Black Parade is a rock and roll gem that celebrates everything that was over the top about the 1970s rock scene." [...] David Fricke of Rolling Stone praised the classic rock feel of the album. Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "On their third studio album, a musical H-bomb of an effort, the Jersey quintet combine the rock-opera pomp of Queen with the darker, dirtier tones of their screamo past: Call it a Bro-hemian Rhapsody. Even without its broad concept — a dying cancer patient seeks revenge and redemption — Parade stands {{as one of the most}} cohesive, engaging rock records of 2006."

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker {{gave the}} episode an A, posing the question: [...] "Has there {{ever been a}} TV show more aptly named than Glee? It both embodies and inspires exactly that quality." [...] Glee was the top ranked topic on social {{networking}} site Twitter {{on the night of}} its initial airing. Alessandra Stanley for The New York Times called the show [...] "blissfully unoriginal in a witty, imaginative way", saying the characters are [...] "high school archetypes" [...] but noted [...] "a strong satiric pulse that doesn’t diminish the characters’ identities or dim the showmanship of a talented cast". The Daily News David Hinckley wrote that the show [...] "isn't close to perfect" [...] but [...] "has likable characters, <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and a reasonably deft touch with music." [...] He called the pilot episode [...] "not very plausible" [...] but [...] "potentially heartwarming", writing of the musical choices: [...] "The duet of [...] "You're the One That I Want" [...] from Grease may be a little obvious, but setting a group dance routine to Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab" [...] shows some inspiration. Whether Glee can hold that note remains a very unanswered question. But it will at least be worth watching to see." [...] USA Today Robert Bianco assessed: [...] "There's a lot to like here: the exuberance of the musical numbers, the bite to the comedy and the joy of seeing something different. It has casting and tone problems, but it has all summer to fix them." ...|$|E

He was a senior honors student at Saint Joseph Academy (St. Joe), a Catholic private school in Brownsville. He had a 98.5 grade-point average, was ranked eleventh in his class, and was going to attend the honors program at the University of Texas at Austin on graduation. At 18 years old, he enjoyed basketball and was a fan of the Los Angeles Lakers, loved computers, and talked about pursuing a career as an engineer. Along with two other classmates, he was voted [...] "Most Sarcastic" [...] by his high school class, and was known for sometimes acting foolish, and having <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b> He was also [...] "often attracted to the more Latina girls of the school". During his junior year, he dated Cristina, who was a year younger than him. Most of Fischer's friends described her as quiet, although some said she was only reserved with people she did not know. Cristina's mother Dora Garcia Cisneros approved of Fischer's relationship with her daughter and thought he was potentially a good candidate for marriage. In Cisneros's eyes, Fischer was an overachieving student from a good family, and [...] "wasn't wild, like many of the St. Joe boys".|$|E

Before David Mirkin arrived to take over as showrunner for season five, Oakley, Weinstein, O'Brien and Dan McGrath were the only writers working {{on the show and}} spent a month mapping out most of the season's episodes.

The episode proved somewhat controversial; some Australian fans said the episode was a mockery of their country.

The pair wrote the two-part episode [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?", which was initially proposed by series creator Matt Groening. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go to jail and it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident.|$|E

2500|$|Lacking the {{photogenic}} {{looks of}} many of his rock and roll contemporaries, Orbison eventually developed a persona that did not reflect his personality. He had no publicist in the early 1960s, no presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. Life magazine called him an [...] "anonymous celebrity". After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an airplane in 1963 while on tour with the Beatles, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Wayfarer sunglasses on stage and found that he preferred them. His biographers suggest that although he had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and was never morose, Orbison was very shy and suffered from severe stage fright; wearing sunglasses helped him hide somewhat from the attention. The ever-present sunglasses led some people to assume, then and now, that the stationary performer was blind. The black clothes and desperation in his songs led to an aura of mystery and introversion. Years later Orbison said, [...] "I wasn't trying to be weird, you know? I didn't have a manager who told me to dress or how to present myself or anything. But the image developed of a man of mystery and a quiet man in black somewhat of a recluse, although I never was, really." ...|$|E

30|$|Creating {{a strong}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social {{presence}} or belonging {{in an online}} environment is also extremely beneficial for students wrestling with mathematical concepts and procedures (Zhang and Walls 2006). There are different ways to help create <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social presence in online courses. First, perceived instructor’s support may influence online student’s emotions and motivation (Kim and Hodges 2012). Instructor profiles posted on a course website encourage students {{to realize that they}} are connecting with real people and have the desired access to instructor support (Huan et al. 2011).
