5|$|His {{increasing}} interest in mineralogy {{at this time}} is also apparent from the titles of two books he authored between 1803 and 1809. The first was a two volume work that appeared in 1804 entitled A Practical Essay on the Analysis of Minerals, which was reissued in 1808 as A Manual of Analytical Mineralogy. In 1809 he published Analysis of a Course of Lectures on Mineralogy.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Middle Ages, the {{functions}} <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> households started to change. This was due primarily to two factors. First of all, the introduction of gunpowder to the field of warfare rendered the castle a less effective defence, and did away with the military function of the household. The result was a household more focused on comfort and luxury, and with a significantly larger proportion of women.|$|E
5|$|Biomes {{are larger}} units of {{organization}} that categorize {{regions of the}} Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, temperate deciduous forest, taiga, tundra, hot desert, and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe, {{the human body is}} a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays {{a significant role in the}} ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary sources do {{not give}} {{reliable}} data on the size <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> Harold's army, although two Norman sources give figures of 1.2million or 400,000 men. Recent historians have suggested figures of between 5000 and 13,000 for Harold's army at Hastings, but most agree {{on a range of}} between 7000 and 8000 English troops. These men would have comprised a mix of the fyrd (militia mainly composed of foot soldiers) and the housecarls, or nobleman's personal troops, who usually also fought on foot. The main difference between the two types was in their armour; the housecarls used better protecting armour than that of the fyrd. The English army {{does not appear to have}} had many archers, although some were present. The identities of few of the Englishmen at Hastings are known; the most important were Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine. About 18 other named individuals can reasonably be assumed to have fought with Harold at Hastings, including two other relatives.|$|E
5|$|From {{the mid-19th}} century onwards, changes in {{military}} technology repeatedly challenged the value <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> Britain's coastal defences. The introduction of shell guns and steam ships created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast, and fears grew of a conflict in the early 1850s. Southsea Castle and St Mawes were extended with new gun batteries, Pendennis was reequipped with heavier guns and Hurst was extensively redeveloped. There were discussions about rearming Calshot, but these were rejected, {{in part due to}} concerns about the suitability of the 16th-century walls in modern warfare. The Crimean War sparked a fresh invasion scare and in 1855 the south coast of England was refortified. New guns were installed at St Catherine's and Yarmouth in 1855. The remains of the West Blockhouse were destroyed by a new fortification, the West Blockhouse Fort, designed to deal with the French threat.|$|E
5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, extracts of I. badia fruit {{bodies have}} been shown to have significant antioxidative properties in vitro. Fruit bodies contain the compound theanine, an amino acid and a glutamic acid analogue found in green tea. Efforts have been made to establish a protocol for producing theanine by growing the fungus mycelium using submerged fermentation. Several indole compounds have been detected in fruit bodies. Unprocessed mushrooms contain tryptophan (0.68mg per 100g dry weight), tryptamine (0.47), serotonin (0.52), kynurenine sulphate (1.96), and kynurenic acid (1.57). Due to their temperature sensitivity, cooking significantly changes the contents <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> indole compounds: cooked mushrooms contained tryptophan (1.74mg/100g dw), 5-methyltryptophan (6.55), melatonin (0.71), and indoleacetonitrile (2.07). Fruit body extracts {{have been shown}} to slow the growth of certain tumour cell lines in cell culture.|$|E

The army consisted of cavalry, infantry, and archers or crossbowmen, with about equal numbers of cavalry and archers and the foot soldiers equal in number {{to the other two}} types combined.

5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} is generated within regions of the interior where convective circulation occurs. This movement of conductive plasma functions like a dynamo, wherein the movement of electrical charges induce {{magnetic field}}s, as does a mechanical dynamo. Those magnetic fields have a great range that extend throughout and beyond the star. The strength of the magnetic field varies with the mass <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> the star, {{and the amount of}} magnetic surface activity depends upon the star's rate of rotation. This surface activity produces starspots, which are regions of strong magnetic fields and lower than normal surface temperatures. Coronal loops are arching magnetic field flux lines that rise from a star's surface into the star's outer atmosphere, its corona. The coronal loops can be seen due to the plasma they conduct along their length. Stellar flares are bursts of high-energy particles that are emitted due to the same magnetic activity.|$|E
