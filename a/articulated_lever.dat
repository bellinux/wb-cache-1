5000|$|... "The engine a {{sets the}} face plate b, {{which serves as}} the flywheel, into motion and the {{rotation}} is transferred to the discus wheel c. Through this the shaft dd with the sprocket turns. Thus the chain e drives the rear axle. The speed is adjusted by shifting the discus wheel c on the shaft dd {{by means of the}} hand lever fastened {{to the left of the}} upper end of the steering column and the <b>articulated</b> <b>lever</b> f. The bearings of the shaft dd with the discus wheel c can be shifted forwards and backwards carriage-like by the hand lever g to the right of the driver's seat. By means of this hand lever the discus wheel c is engaged with the face plate b and the engine, or idling, pressed backwards against the brake arm f to brake the car. So this lever serves both to brake and to engage the clutch. Independently of the aforementioned brake there are two band brakes r1 and r2 on both rear wheels. The beehive radiator n cools the cylinders by means of the belt-driven pump l. The chassis is made of iron-reinforced wood. The front axle is straight, the rear axle is full-length and has no differential." ...|$|E
40|$|The device {{comprises}} an <b>articulated</b> <b>lever</b> {{arrangement with}} the inner joints (116) {{of the first and}} second levers (114 A, 114 B) locked by at least one locking component (120) in the extended position {{in the form of an}} immovable triangle. The levers are located along one axis (112) which runs in the direction of the force path of the press. The outer joints (118) each have a common pivot axis. A damping device, consisting of a piston and cylinder, is located between the inner joints and acts in the direction of the force path. ADVANTAGE - Safe transmission of the press is made possible...|$|E
40|$|There are {{at least}} two {{articulated}} levers (16, 18) arranged in a mirror image formation and linked to shared outer links (12, 14) have toggle links (20, 22) rigidly connected at an adjustable spacing. The first outer link (12) is connectable to the drive of the press, and the second, lower outer link (14) is connected to a press plunger. An adjustment (32, 34) consists of a linear drive piece joining the toggle links and consisting of a threaded spindle (32) and an adjusting motor (34). Each <b>articulated</b> <b>lever</b> consists of pairs of levers (26, 24; 28, 30) joined by the outer links and by bolts (19) belonging to the inner links. ADVANTAGE - The economically produced coupling enables the length to be altered easily, and induces additional movements while the mechanical press is operating...|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to increased competition from German Manufactured Air weaponsâ€™ it was re-launched in 1980 as the Mercury [...] "S" [...] with a checkered Walnut stock, heavier barrel, an improved trigger, an <b>articulated</b> cocking <b>lever,</b> metal open sights, and a fully blued metalwork finish. The {{quality of the}} [...] "S" [...] version is generally considered superior to earlier guns.|$|R
40|$|In an {{assembly}} device for the fine positioning and assembly of parts with vibrational aid for industrial robots having a gripper (7) {{moved by the}} robot to pick up, transport and assemble at least one part to a workpiece, in particular a printed circuit board, whereby at least one vibrator is provided to facilitate assembly, said vibrator generating a relative movement of the assembly part {{in relation to the}} workpiece and on which the vibration amplitude and/or vibration frequency is adjustable or presettable in relation to the part and/or workpiece, the invention proposes to create a flexible and adaptable assembly device comprising the gripper (7) attached to a special vibrator head (28), said vibrator head (28) having at least two or preferably four plates (2 - 5), said plates (2 - 4) being interconnected by means of springs and/or <b>articulated</b> <b>levers</b> so that a relative movement of two adjacent plates (2 - 3, 3 - 4, 4 - 5) is only possible {{in the direction of a}} degree of freedom and t hat the other plates are rigidly interconnected in the direction of this degree of freedom and that a vibration force source (6) is provided between the two adjacent plates, by which the two plates are displaceable by vibration in relation to one another in the direction of the degree of freedom...|$|R
