5|$|Biblical and extrabiblical {{evidence}} suggests that of the Arabian tribes, the Qedarites were most prominent in their contacts with the world outside of the Arabian Peninsula. Like other nomadic groups, they lived primarily in unfortified encampments. Pastoralists <b>and</b> <b>traders</b> in livestock, such as male lambs, rams and goats, they also {{played a key role}} in the prosperity of Gaza's incense trade, controlling traffic in the desert regions between Egypt and Palestine. As a result of their trading activities, there were clans from among the Qedarites that became wealthy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the {{increasing}} wealth of middle class merchants <b>and</b> <b>traders</b> meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy, {{and threatened to}} break {{down some of the}} symbolic barriers between the nobility and the lower classes. The response came in two forms: didactic literature warning of the dangers of adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class, and sumptuary laws that put a cap on the lavishness of commoners' banquets.|$|E

5|$|Multnomah County {{is named}} for Native Americans {{who lived in the}} area before {{settlement}} by non-indigenous people in the 19thcentury. Members of the Multnomah tribe of the Chinookan people lived on Sauvie Island in the Willamette River and on the mainland across from the island, downstream from the mouth of Balch Creek. Much of the area near the lower creek was swampy, and was not favored by the Multnomah. By the 1830s, diseases carried by white explorers <b>and</b> <b>traders</b> reduced the native population by up to 90percent in the lower Columbia basin.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters {{have the}} {{thickest}} fur of any mammal. Their beautiful fur is a main target for many hunters. Archaeological {{evidence indicates that}} for thousands of years, indigenous peoples have hunted sea otters for food and fur. Large-scale hunting, part of the Maritime Fur Trade, which would eventually kill approximately one million sea otters, began in the 18th century when hunters <b>and</b> <b>traders</b> began to arrive {{from all over the}} world to meet foreign demand for otter pelts, which were one of the world's most valuable types of fur.|$|E

5|$|The {{excavated}} area of {{the mound}} was demarcated into two zones {{on the basis of}} occupation and elevation. Northern sector of the mound is nearer to the sea coast while the southern sector is farther away from the coast. The ceramic find of crockery and cooking vessels found in the northern sector were indicative of mass feeding of sailors <b>and</b> <b>traders</b> who camped there. Wine stored in amphorae was the principal item imported from the western countries during the later part of the 2nd century BCE.|$|E
5|$|The {{hundreds}} of villae found in Switzerland, some very luxurious, {{attest to the}} existence of a wealthy and cultured upper class of landowners. Many villae belonged not to Roman immigrants, but to members of the Celtic aristocracy who continued to hold their lands and their rank after the Roman conquest. Of the lower classes, much less is known, although there are inscriptions attesting {{to the existence of}} guilds (collegia) of boat skippers, doctors, teachers <b>and</b> <b>traders,</b> {{as well as to the}} existence of a trade in slaves.|$|E
5|$|A further Bill in 1740 sought {{powers to}} improve the river from Barnby Dun to Fishlake Ferry. Despite serious opposition, which {{included}} the merchants <b>and</b> <b>traders</b> of Doncaster as well as Doncaster Corporation, the Bill was passed, giving the company new powers to make the river deeper and create a cut to avoid the shallows at Stainforth and Bramwith. Work on this northern section started almost immediately. The southern section to Tinsley was navigable by 1751, although the wharf and warehouse had not been completed by that date, and the towpath from Rotherham was not completed until 1822.|$|E

5|$|Bulgarian {{nationalism}} gradually {{emerged during}} the mid-19th century with the economic upsurge of Bulgarian merchants and craftsmen, the development of Bulgarian-funded popular education, the struggle for an autonomous Bulgarian Church and political actions towards {{the formation of a}} separate Bulgarian state. The First and Second Serbian Uprisings had laid the foundation of an autonomous Serbia during the late 1810s, and Greece had been established as an independent state in 1832, {{in the wake of the}} Greek War of Independence. However, support for gaining independence through an armed struggle against the Ottomans was not universal. Revolutionary sentiment was concentrated largely among the more educated and urban sectors of the populace. There was less support for an organized revolt among the peasantry and the wealthier merchants <b>and</b> <b>traders,</b> who feared that Ottoman reprisals would jeopardize economic stability and widespread rural land ownership.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} 19thcentury, the Oregon Trail, a pioneer trail {{of which a}} major portion {{followed}} the Snake River, had been established by aspiring settlers <b>and</b> <b>traders.</b> Steamboats and railroads moved agricultural products and minerals along the river throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. The powerful, steep flow of the Snake River has been used since the 1890s to generate hydroelectricity, enhance navigation, and provide irrigation water from fifteen major dams built on the lower river, transforming it {{into a series of}} reservoirs. Several of these have been proposed for removal in order to restore some of the river's once-tremendous salmon runs.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{culture has}} {{historically}} been influenced by Indigenous, French and British cultures and traditions. Most of Canada's territory was inhabited and developed later than other European colonies in the Americas, {{with the result that}} themes and symbols of pioneers, trappers, <b>and</b> <b>traders</b> were important in the early development of the Canadian identity. First Nations played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The British conquest of New France in the mid-1700s brought a large Francophone population under British Imperial rule, creating a need for compromise and accommodation. The new British rulers left alone much of the religious, political, and social culture of the French-speaking habitants, guaranteeing through the Quebec Act of 1774 the right of the Canadiens to practise the Catholic faith and to use French civil law (now Quebec law).|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Charles I, the gentry took an {{increased}} interest as patrons and occasionally as players. A big attraction for them was the opportunity that the game offered for gambling and this escalated {{in the years following}} the Restoration when cricket in London and the south-eastern counties of England evolved into a popular social activity. Its patrons staged lucrative eleven-a-side matches featuring the earliest professional players. Meanwhile, English colonists had introduced cricket to North America and the West Indies, and the sailors <b>and</b> <b>traders</b> of the East India Company had taken it to the Indian subcontinent.|$|E
5|$|Explorers {{searching for}} the fabled Northwest Passage and large inland seas in North America {{continued}} to pass through this region. Fort Beauharnois was built by the French in 1721 on Lake Pepin to facilitate exploration. In the 17th century a lucrative trade developed between Native Americans who trapped animals near the Great Lakes <b>and</b> <b>traders</b> who shipped the animal furs to Europe. For two centuries this trade network was the prime economic driver in the area. A notable result of this trade network was the Métis people, a mixed-race community descended from Native Americans and French traders, {{as well as other}} mixed-race peoples. In particular during the latter 18th century numerous French and English traders in the Minnesota region purchased Sioux wives in order to establish kinship relationships with the Sioux so as to secure their supply of furs from the tribes.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} debates on the actual taking of the Bastille in 1789 has been {{the nature of the}} crowds that stormed the building. Hippolyte Taine argued in the late 19th century that the crowd {{consisted}} of unemployed vagrants, who acted without real thought; by contrast, the post-war left-wing intellectual George Rudé argued that the crowd was dominated by relatively prosperous artisan workers. The matter was reexamined by Jacques Godechot in the post-war years; Godechot showing convincingly that, in addition to some local artisans <b>and</b> <b>traders,</b> at least half the crowd that gathered that day were, like the inhabitants of the surrounding faubourg, recent immigrants to Paris from the provinces. Godechot used this to characterise the taking of the Bastille as a genuinely national event of wider importance to French society.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{emergence}} of the ice trade of the 19th century, snow and ice had been collected and stored to use in the summer months {{in various parts of the}} world, but never on a large scale. In the Mediterranean and in South America, for example, there was a long history of collecting ice from the upper slopes of the Alps and the Andes during the summer months <b>and</b> <b>traders</b> transporting this down into the cities. Similar trading practices had grown up in Mexico during the colonial period. The Russians collected ice along the Neva River during the winter months for consumption in Saint Petersburg for many years. Wealthy Europeans began to build ice houses to store ice gathered on their local estates during the winter from the 16th century onwards; the ice was used to cool drinks or food for the wealthiest elites.|$|E
5|$|The Betsimisaraka ("the many inseparables") are {{the second}} largest ethnic group in Madagascar after the Merina and make up {{approximately}} fifteen percent of the Malagasy people. They occupy a large stretch of the eastern coastal region of Madagascar, from Mananjary {{in the south to}} Antalaha in the north. The Betsimisaraka {{have a long history of}} extensive interaction with European seafarers <b>and</b> <b>traders</b> that produced a significant subset with mixed European-Malagasy origins, termed the zana-malata. European influence is evident in the local valse (waltz) and basesa musical genres, which are typically performed on the accordion. Tromba (spirit possession) ceremonies feature strongly in Betsimisaraka culture.|$|E

The Marsh Tacky {{developed}} from Spanish horses brought to the South Carolina coast by Spanish explorers, settlers <b>and</b> <b>traders</b> as early as the 16th century.
