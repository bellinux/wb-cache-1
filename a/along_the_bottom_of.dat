5|$|Some species {{differ in}} form from the typical octopus body shape. Members of the {{suborder}} Cirrina have stout gelatinous bodies with webbing that reaches near {{the tip of}} their arms, and two large fins above the eyes, supported by an internal shell. Fleshy papillae or cirri are found <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the arms, and the eyes are more developed.|$|E
5|$|Six {{external}} hardpoints {{were located}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the helicopter, with two under each wing and {{two on the}} fuselage under the sponsons. The two inner wing hardpoints could carry pods of three TOW anti-tank missiles. 2.75-inch (70mm) rockets in 7-rocket or 19-rocket launchers could be carried on the four wing hardpoints. The two fuselage mounts were dedicated to carrying external fuel tanks. The wing hardpoints were also plumbed to allow the carriage of additional fuel tanks if required.|$|E
5000|$|In geography, a plain is a flat, {{sweeping}} landmass {{that generally}} {{does not change}} much in elevation. Plains occur as lowlands <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> valleys or on the doorsteps of mountains, as coastal plains, and as plateaus or uplands.|$|R

This jersey was in use until the end of the 2006–07 season.|$|E
5|$|The more major of {{the current}} roads often started as turnpikes in the 16th century. These avoid the highest areas of the hills. To {{the north of the}} western part of the Mendips, the A368 {{separates}} the hills from the Chew Valley, while on the southern edge the A371 similarly runs <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the scarp slope between the hills and the Somerset Levels. The western end of the hills is crossed by the M5 motorway and A38. Further east, and running almost north to south, are the A37 and A39.|$|E
5|$|Most Tales {{games have}} skits, side conversations between {{different}} characters {{that can be}} both dramatic and comedic in nature. They are commonly portrayed as character portraits or profiles, with text <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the screen. They were first introduced in Tales of Destiny, though the majority were cut from the English release. In the original English GameCube release of Symphonia, the voice track for the skits was removed, but for its HD re-release, the Japanese voice track, and consequently the skit voice tracks, were included. The first English release to include fully voiced skits was Vesperia: they had been planned for Abyss, but were cut due to space issues. Another recurring feature is the Cooking system, where characters learn and prepare dishes to restore health and forms of experience points.|$|E
50|$|The Mountain Lakes Wilderness is a {{wilderness}} area {{located in the}} Fremont-Winema National Forest in the southern Cascade Range of Oregon in the United States.

5|$|Within Shepton Mallet {{there are}} several {{distinct}} areas which originated as separate communities around the central point {{of the church and}} Market Place. The town centre is small, basically consisting of two streets: High Street, which runs south from the Market Place towards the Townsend Retail Park, and the pedestrianised Town Street which runs north from the Market Place to Waterloo Bridge. To the east, separated from the Market Place by the Academy complex, is the parish church of St Peter and St Paul. Lower Lane, which runs under Waterloo Bridge <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the river valley {{to the north of the}} town centre, is one of the few parts of the town where the River Sheppey runs above ground. At the eastern end is Leg Square, which is surrounded by three large houses originally built by owners of some of the town's mills. Very close by is Cornhill, on which the former prison stands.|$|E
5|$|The river {{flows through}} the South Downs, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and since 2011, a {{designated}} national park. There are two large aquifers in the area, one consisting of chalk, {{to the south of}} the river valley, and the other the Lower Greensand Group, underlying the whole of the river. The aquifers are separated by a Gault Formation, which consists of clay. At {{the western edge of the}} region, both the chalk and the gault turn to the north, creating a scarp slope. The base flow of the river consists of water from the Lower Greensand aquifer, and from springs <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the chalk scarp slope. These help to maintain the flows in the river during the summer months, although there have been significant periods where flows have been low, notably in the drought of the early 1990s, and again in 1995/96. These led to declines in the populations of the macro-invertebrates which are used to measure the health of a river, but these have subsequently recovered. In order to monitor the hydrology, the Environment Agency has a series of observation boreholes along the valley, and maintains gauging stations at Princes Marsh, close to the source, at Iping Mill, at Halfway Bridge on the River Lod just above its junction with the Rother, and at Hardham, just before the river joins the Arun.|$|E
5|$|There {{are still}} several {{quarries}} on the Mendip Hills. Some {{of the stone}} is still carried by Mendip Rail; the other railways in the area closed in the 1960s. Although the Roman Fosse Way crossed the hills, the main roads generally avoid the higher areas and run <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the scarp slope on {{the north and south}} of the hills. The western end of the hills is crossed by the M5 motorway and A38. Further east, and running almost north to south, are the A37 and A39. A wide range of outdoor sports and leisure activities take place in the Mendips, many based on the particular geology of the area. The hills are recognised as a national centre for caving and cave diving, as well as being popular with climbers, hillwalkers and natural historians. Wookey Hole Caves and some of the caves in Cheddar Gorge are open as show caves; however, many of the caves of the Mendip Hills are only accessible to members of caving clubs. Long distance footpaths include the Mendip Way and Limestone Link.|$|E

50|$|As late as 2000, some {{coral reefs}} were {{discovered}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian fjords. These reefs {{were found in}} fjords from the north of Norway to the south. The marine life on the reefs {{is believed to be}} one of the most important reasons why the Norwegian coastline is such a generous fishing ground. Since this discovery is fairly new, little research has been done. The reefs are host to thousands of lifeforms such as plankton, coral, anemones, fish, several species of shark, and many more. Most are specially adapted to life under the greater pressure of the water column above it, and the total darkness of the deep sea.|$|R

500|$|The {{evolution}} of tetrapods began about 400 {{million years ago}} in the Devonian Period with the earliest tetrapods evolved from lobe-finned fishes. Tetrapods are categorized as a biological superclass, Tetrapoda, which includes all living and extinct amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. [...] While most species today are terrestrial, little evidence supports the idea that any of the earliest tetrapods could move about on land, as their limbs could not have held their midsections off the ground and the known trackways do not indicate they dragged their bellies around. Presumably, the tracks were made by animals walking <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> shallow bodies of water. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.|$|R

50|$|The {{star-nosed mole}} lives in wet lowland areas and eats small invertebrates, aquatic insects, worms, mollusks, small {{amphibians}} and small fish. Condylura cristata {{has also been}} found in dry meadows farther away from water. They have also {{been found in the}} Great Smokey Mountains as high up as 1676 meters. However, the star-nose mole does prefer wet, poorly drained areas and marshes. It is a good swimmer and can forage <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> streams and ponds. Like other moles, this animal digs shallow surface tunnels for foraging; often, these tunnels exit underwater. It is active day and night and remains active in winter, when it has been observed tunneling through the snow and swimming in ice-covered streams. Little is known about the social behavior of the species, but it is suspected to be colonial.|$|R
