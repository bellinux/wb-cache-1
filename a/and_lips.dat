5|$|Horses, plains zebras and {{mountain}} zebras live in stable, closed family groups or harems consisting of one adult male, several females and their offspring. These groups {{have their own}} home ranges which overlap {{and they tend to}} be nomadic. The stability of the group remains even when the family stallion dies or is displaced. Plains zebra groups gather into large herds and may create temporarily stable subgroups within a herd, allowing individuals to interact with those outside their group. Among harem-holding species, this behavior has only otherwise been observed in primates like the gelada and the hamadryas baboon. Females of harem species benefit as males give them more time for feeding, protection for their young, as well as protection from predators and harassment by outside males. Among females in a harem, a linear dominance hierarchy exists based on the time at which they join the group. Harems travel in a consistent filing order with the high-ranking mares and their offspring leading the groups followed by the next highest ranking mare and her offspring and so on. The family stallion takes up the rear. Social grooming (which involves individuals rubbing their heads against each other and nipping with the incisors <b>and</b> <b>lips)</b> is important for easing aggression and maintaining social bonds and status. Young of both sexes leave their natal groups as they mature; females are usually abducted by outside males to be included as permanent members of their harems.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} MLSLib, a software library for human figure animation with lip syncing. The library {{enables us to}} easily use multiple TTSs <b>and</b> multiple <b>lip</b> motion generators, <b>and</b> switch them arbitrarily. It also helps use of multiple speaking agents, possibly with different TTSs <b>and</b> <b>lip</b> motion generators. The MLSLib is composed of three modules: LSSAgent, TTSManager, and FCPManager; The LSSAgent module provides unified simple APIs per single agent, independent of TTSs <b>and</b> <b>lip</b> motion generators. The TTSManager and FCPManager manage TTSs <b>and</b> <b>lip</b> motion generators, respectively. Both modules support standard sets of phonetic alphabets per language, and thus users are freed from TTS-dependent implementation of lip motion generators. Applications to multi-lingual agents <b>and</b> LOD in <b>lip</b> syncing are also presented...|$|R

5000|$|Costa and Corazza (2006), {{examining}} 776 artistic portraits {{covering the}} whole history of art, showed that eye roundness, lip roundness, eye height, eye width, <b>and</b> <b>lip</b> height were significantly enhanced in artistic portraits compared to photographic ones matched for sex and age. In a second study, forty-two art academy students were requested to draw two self-portraits, one with a mirror and one without (from memory). Eye <b>and</b> <b>lip</b> size <b>and</b> roundness were greater in artistic self-portraits.

25|$|Within {{the spinal}} trigeminal nucleus, {{information}} {{is represented in}} an onion-skin fashion. The lowest levels of the nucleus (in the upper cervical cord and lower medulla) represent peripheral areas of the face (the scalp, ears and chin). Higher levels (in the upper medulla) represent central areas (nose, cheeks <b>and</b> <b>lips).</b> The highest levels (in the pons) represent the mouth, teeth and pharyngeal cavity. Sulfur-containing compounds found in plants in the onion family stimulate receptors found in trigeminal ganglia, bypassing the olfactory system.|$|E

25|$|As noted, {{not much}} {{is known about}} the details of the structure. The church was built with five domes: the central dome was {{dedicated}} to Christ while the four smaller ones housed chapels of the four other saints to whom the church was dedicated. The exact arrangement of the domes and the type of the church are disputed. Most scholars consider it to have been a cross-in-square structure, similar to the later Myrelaion <b>and</b> <b>Lips</b> Monastery churches. Indeed, the widespread use of this type throughout the Orthodox world, from the Balkans to Russia, is commonly ascribed to the prestige of this imperial building.|$|E

They have robust bodies, {{strongly}} muscled, with long legs and a short back. The tail is carried with a slight curl. The body when seen sideways, forms a prone rectangle. The length of body is slightly longer than the height at the withers, approximately 104% of the height at withers. The Komondor has a broad head with the muzzle slightly shorter than half of the length of the head, with an even and complete scissor bite. Nose <b>and</b> <b>lips</b> are always black.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{epithelial}} expression of E-cadherin and c-Met in normal lip, in actinic cheilitis <b>and</b> <b>lip</b> squamous cell carcinoma. Study Design: Biopsies of normal lip vermillion (NL, n= 18), actinic cheilitis (AC, n= 37), <b>and</b> <b>lip</b> SCC (n= 22) were processed for E-cadherin and c-Met immunodetection. Epithelial and tumor cell expression was scored for each sample considering staining intensity and percentage. Results: E-cadherin expression was significantly reduced in AC <b>and</b> <b>lip</b> SCC as compared to normal lip (P< 0. 05), with a significant reduction in lip SCC as compared to AC (P= 0. 003). Expression of c-Met was significantly higher in AC <b>and</b> <b>lip</b> SCC as compared to NL (P< 0. 05), with a significant increase in lip SCC as compared to AC (P< 0. 0001). Conclusion: The results showed that epithelial E-cadherin expression is reduced and c-Met expression is increased as lip carcinogenesis progresses, suggesting that these proteins may be useful markers of malignant transformation...|$|R
25|$|In the 16th century, John Caius, in {{the most}} {{important}} single source {{in the history of}} the Bloodhound, describes its hanging ears <b>and</b> <b>lips,</b> its use in game parks to follow the scent of blood, which gives it its name, its ability to track thieves and poachers by their foot scent, how it casts if it has lost the scent when thieves cross water, and its use on the Scottish borders to track cross-border raiders, known as Border Reivers. This links it to the sleuth hound, and from Caius also comes the information that the English Bloodhound and the sleuth hound were essentially the same, though the Bloodhound was slightly bigger, with more variation in coat colour.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, he undertook several exhausting tours. His agent Johnny Collins's erratic behavior and his own spending ways left Armstrong short of cash. Breach of contract violations plagued him. Finally, he hired Joe Glaser as his new manager, a tough mob-connected wheeler-dealer, who began to straighten out his legal mess, his mob troubles, and his debts. Armstrong also began to experience problems with his fingers <b>and</b> <b>lips,</b> which were aggravated by his unorthodox playing style. As a result, he branched out, developing his vocal style and making his first theatrical appearances. He appeared in movies again, including Crosby's 1936 hit Pennies from Heaven. In 1937, Armstrong substituted for Rudy Vallee on the CBS radio network {{and became the first}} African American to host a sponsored, national broadcast.|$|E
25|$|Mares {{exist in}} a hierarchy, with the alpha female being the first to mate with the {{stallion}} and being the one to lead the group. When new mares {{are added to the}} group, they are met with hostility by the other mares. Thus, the stallion must shield the new mares until the aggression subsides. The most recently added females rank lowest. Females that become unfit or weak may drop in their rank, though. The female membership of a harem stays intact even if a new stallion takes over. Zebras strengthen their social bonds with grooming. Members of a harem nip and scrape along the neck, withers, and back with their teeth <b>and</b> <b>lips.</b> Mothers and foals groom the most often, followed by siblings. Grooming shows social status and eases aggressive behaviour.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the reliability of 2 scoring systems. DESIGN: This study used a retrospective analysis of the results of complete unilateral cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate patients. SETTING: The study was conducted at the VU Medical Center and the Academic Center for Dentistry of Amsterdam. PATIENTS: Patients were complete unilateral cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate patients at the age of 6 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment of the nose <b>and</b> <b>lip</b> together <b>and</b> separately with a numerical photographic reference scoring system and with a 5 -point ordinal scale without the use of a reference photograph by 6 judges. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability was calculated; both ways of assessment were compared by using Kendall tau. RESULTS: Photographs were available of 55 children (6 years old, 38 boys and 17 girls) with a complete unilateral cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate. The interobserver reliabilities of the <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> nose together were 0. 53 and, for the nose <b>and</b> <b>lip</b> separately, 0. 51 and 0. 43, respectively with the use of the numerical scale. In the 5 -point scale, these were 0. 55 for the nose <b>and</b> <b>lip</b> together <b>and</b> 0. 57 and 0. 45 for the nose <b>and</b> <b>lip</b> separately, respectively. Furthermore, it was found that the lip dominates in the scorings of the <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> nose together (linear regression analysis). CONCLUSIONS: The 2 tested systems are equivalent in their reliability <b>and</b> outcome. The <b>lip</b> is dominating in the overall scorings. It is advocated to use the 5 -point scale without the use of a reference photograph and to assess the <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> nose separately. © 2014 Mutaz B. Habal, MD...|$|R
