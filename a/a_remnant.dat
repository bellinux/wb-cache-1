5|$|August 18–19, 1977: Hurricane Doreen denegerated into <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> low off {{the coast}} of California. The {{remnants}} moved inland and caused flooding and crop damage as 7.01inches (178mm) of rain fell on Yuma Valley, Arizona.|$|E
5|$|Bilis {{made its}} first {{landfall}} in northern Taiwan on July 13, with an intensity of 55kt (100km/h, 65mph). After moving across northern Taiwan, Bilis made its second landfall in Fujian, China early on July 14 at the same intensity, then weakened into a tropical depression over land the next day. Bilis lingered as a tropical depression over southeastern China before degenerating into <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> low on July 16. But the JMA carried {{the system as a}} tropical depression until July 17. Despite becoming <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> low, the remnants of Bilis maintained their identity for several days while moving westward over China, bringing heavy rains to inland areas.|$|E

5|$|Late on December8, Epsilon transitioned into <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> low {{pressure}} area. The remnant circulation elongated {{in advance of}} a frontal zone, and it dissipated late on December9. The front absorbed the remnants the next day.|$|E
5|$|The 1526 {{death of}} Janusz III of Masovia, {{the last of}} the Masovian Piast dukes line (<b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> of the {{fragmentation}} period divisions), enabled Sigismund I to finalize the incorporation of Masovia into the Polish Crown in 1529.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave {{organized into}} a tropical depression by 06:00UTC on September1 about 920mi (1,480km) west-southwest of Cabo Verde. With {{a burst of}} convection near its center, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gaston six hours later and reached peak winds of 40mph (65km/h). Despite initial projections that Gaston would become an increasingly strong hurricane over the central Atlantic, exceptionally dry air began to wrap in the storm after peak. It weakened to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on September2 and further degenerated into <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> low by 18:00UTC that day. The system nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone the following day as shallow convection wrapped into the center, but the increased organization was transient and it ultimately remained <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> low until dissipating southeast on the Dominican Republic on September8. The remnants of Gaston produced sporadic rainfall across Puerto Rico, peaking at 3.03in (76.9mm) in Naguabo.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave that}} crossed Central America organized and {{developed into a}} tropical depression on June 27. Contrary to forecasts, the depression did not strengthen further because of strong wind shear. By June 29, the depression had become <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> low, which was observed as a swirl of clouds {{for a few more}} days before dissipating.|$|E
5|$|August 28, 1995– Tropical Depression Jerry {{degenerates into}} <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> low over Georgia, {{dropping}} heavy rainfall that causes localized serious flooding. Dozens of homes sustain flood damage, and monetary {{damage in the}} state totals over $7.5million (1995USD, $10.2million 2007USD).|$|E
5|$|Because of northeasterly shear, {{the center}} of the {{circulation}} was removed from the convection, and the depression degenerated into <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> low late on August 29. Many of the models had indicated that this was likely, but the National Hurricane Center (NHC) instead chose to forecast slight strengthening.|$|E

5|$|By July 10, Darby {{had lost}} all of its {{tropical}} characteristics. As the remnant low pressure meandered across the southwest United States it moved north, and tracked offshore of California, where it persisted as <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> low and produced shower activity to parts of California.|$|E
5|$|By September 2, the storm's {{convective}} thunderstorms warmed slightly, indicating weakening to {{just below}} Category5. An eyewall replacement cycle took place, and two eye structures formed as gradual weakening continued. By September 2, {{the storm was}} downgraded to Category3 just before it turned slightly to the west. The storm underwent another eyewall replacement cycle as winds decreased further. As the storm entered cooler waters, winds decreased to 100mph (160km/h), below major hurricane intensity. Soon Hernan was downgraded to Category1, and the eye became cloud-filled. On September 5, Hernan was downgraded to a tropical storm as winds rapidly weakened to 45mph (72km/h) despite developing a new band of convection. That same day, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression as it began to lose tropical characteristics. Strong wind shear developed, further dissipating the depression. On September 6, the system degenerated into <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> low-pressure system which spawned <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> plume of moisture that meandered {{off the coast of}} California, producing light showers.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{moving over}} warm waters, Elida began to weaken because it began an eyewall {{replacement}} cycle. When the cycle ended, the cyclone was over cooler water and unsteadily weakened. Elida fell to {{a tropical storm}} on July 27, then degenerated into <b>a</b> <b>remnant</b> low {{and turned to the}} northeast. The remnant dissipated over the open ocean about 535mi (861km) west of Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Turkish War (1683–1698), Slavonia was regained but western Bosnia, {{which had}} been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest, {{remained}} outside Croatian control.
