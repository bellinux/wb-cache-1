50|$|Richard 'Dick' Swiveller, in turn, Frederick Trent's {{manipulated}} friend; Sampson Brass's clerk; and the Marchioness' guardian {{and eventual}} husband. He delights in quoting and <b>adapting</b> <b>literature</b> {{to describe his}} experiences. He is very laid-back and doesn't seem to worry about anything, {{despite the fact that}} he owes money to just about everybody. Following Fred's departure from the story, he becomes more independent and eventually is seen as a strong force for good, securing Kit's release from prison and the Marchioness' future. His transformation from an idle and vacant youth to a key helpmate bridges the depiction of the main characters that are either mostly villainous or goodly in nature.|$|E
5000|$|Shyamaprasad has adapted several {{classics}} on celluloid so far. Arike is {{the latest}} in that list and is based on a Bengali short story by Sunil Gangopadhyay, whose novel was also the base for the director's Ore Kadal. Says the director, [...] "I don’t think adapting stories from other languages is an issue at all, because human emotions are universal and can be told without linguistic barriers. I am fond of <b>adapting</b> <b>literature,</b> since writing a story is not my forte and I do not believe in concocting a story for the sake of filmmaking." [...] He also adds that Basu Chatterjee, noted Bollywood director who portrayed the middle-class in many films, proved to be his guiding force while making Arike.|$|E

Myra Platt, Book-It’s future Co-Artistic Director, joined The Collective in 1988. Members of The Collective began to experiment {{with the concept of}} Book-It by <b>adapting</b> <b>literature</b> into theatreWhen Book-It first moved to Seattle Center, their location was called the Center House.

40|$|As {{the present}} {{appears to be}} {{catching}} up to visions of the future, the popularity of science fiction is growing among audiences. Although the genre has not often been represented on stage previously, {{the past few years}} have seen an increase in science fiction productions; particularly in the form of adaptations of well-known novels. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the connections between science fiction and technological advances. This practice-based research uses the dramaturgical tools of <b>adapting</b> <b>literature</b> for the stage as a critical and creative research method in order to understand how storytelling interprets science and innovation, and how the sciences in turn are influenced by fiction. During the course of the adaptation process, I have discovered a link based around the discussion of humanity versus technology, and specifically natural versus scientifically guided evolution. While the majority of new inventions are designed to make our lives easier, science fiction reflects upon the anxieties of an already technology-reliant society that harbours some fear of the engineered future...|$|E
40|$|<b>Adapting</b> <b>literature</b> from a {{cultural}} context to {{another is the}} main theme of my master's thesis. The aim is to determine how publishing houses adapt a book from a different cultural context to their own, {{and if there are}} any specific marketing choices being made during the publishing process. The thesis highlights two authors, Sara Stridsberg from Sweden and Silke Scheuermann from Germany. Interviews have been made with the publishers, editors and translators of the translated novels. One of the main themes {{is to be able to}} showcase differences between the Swedish and the German publishing business and their particular cultural characteristics in working with translated novels. I have found that the brand of a publishing house is important when making publishing decisions. For larger publishing houses, the economical capital is of importance, and for smaller publishing houses the cultural capital tends to be of a higher value. The book market is becoming more defined by the economy of attention and economization of culture, which is showing in all different aspects of the business; publishing houses, newspapers and agents are all adapting towards a more economic focus...|$|E
