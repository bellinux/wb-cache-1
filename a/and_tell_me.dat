5|$|In February 1993, Sheindlin's outspoken {{reputation}} {{made her}} {{the subject of a}} Los Angeles Times article, profiling her as a woman determined to make the court system work for the common good. She subsequently was featured in a segment on CBS's 60 Minutes, bringing her national recognition. This led to her first book, Don't Pee on My Leg <b>and</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> It's Raining, published in 1996. She retired as a family court judge that same year after hearing over 20,000 cases. After her retirement, Sheindlin continued to receive increasing amounts of public attention.|$|E
5|$|Sheindlin has {{authored}} seven books. In 1995, Judge Sheindlin published {{her first}} book, “Don’t Pee On My Leg <b>and</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> It’s Raining,” {{in which she}} offers her insight into {{how and why the}} family court fails in its mission to impact shattered families. “Beauty Fades, Dumb Is Forever,” her second book, was published in January 1999. A New York Times best seller, the book challenges women to be the best they can be.|$|E
25|$|An evocative {{description}} {{exists in}} words from 1867: ″Look at the dapper little fellow, how neatly {{he sits on}} the back of the old American horse, Reporter. Notice the jerry-hat, the open but determined, never-say-die, countenance, the polished boots, the burnished spurs, the tight-fitting breeches, the long waistcoat, creaseless coat, and general ′get-up′ of that wiry-looking, ten-stone, five-feet-five specimen of humanity, <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> if he is a ′character′ when once seen that will never be forgotten.″ Charlie Canavan differs on one point - he states his weight 'when at man's age' did not exceed 9stone (126lb or 57kg).|$|E

500|$|After the 60 Minutes {{special on}} her family court career in 1993 and {{authoring}} {{her first book}} shortly thereafter (Don't Pee on My Leg <b>and</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> It's Raining), Sheindlin was approached about starring in a new reality courtroom series, featuring [...] "real cases with real rulings." [...] She accepted the offer.|$|E
500|$|Aratus of Sicyon, the strategos of the Achaean League, {{tried to}} re-take Tegea and Orchomenus {{in a night}} attack. Efforts from inside the city failed, though, and Aratus quietly retreated, hoping to remain unnoticed. Cleomenes {{nonetheless}} discovered the plan and {{sent a message to}} Aratus asking about the goal of his expedition. Aratus replied that he had come to stop Cleomenes from fortifying Belbina. Cleomenes responded to this by saying: [...] "If it's all the same to you, write <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> why you brought along those torches and ladders." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} for Chicago Music Magazine, Chloë Agnew described the lyrics of the song as [...] "really incredible". She stated that [...] "It is a songs that I listen to and wish I had written. It’s really so special. I {{think a lot of}} people have found strength and hope in the lyrics. It's been really rewarding to meet and talk to people at our meet and greet events come up <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> how much that song means to them and how it has helped them". Irish singer Chloë Agnew recorded the track for her debut album Chloë (2002).|$|E
500|$|Girls' Generation {{debuted in}} 2007 {{with the single}} [...] "Into the New World" [...] and their self-titled studio album, which was later re-{{released}} as Baby Baby in 2008. The album spawned three more singles: [...] "Girls' Generation", [...] "Kissing You", and [...] "Baby Baby". In 2009, Girls' Generation released two EPs: Gee <b>and</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> Your Wish (Genie) (2009). Their second studio album, Oh! (2010) was later re-released as Run Devil Run (2010). Six months later, they released a third EP, Hoot (2010). The singles [...] "Oh!", [...] "Run Devil Run" [...] and [...] "Hoot" [...] all claimed the top spot on the Gaon Digital Chart.|$|E
500|$|The U.S. Wonderbra rollout {{included}} {{events with}} Eva Herzigová in New York's Times Square. The advertisements were toned down {{in comparison to}} the earlier UK campaign. The U.S. print and billboard advertising showed models wearing only the Wonderbra. Underneath read slogans such as [...] "who cares if it's a bad hair day" [...] and [...] "look me in the eyes <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that you love me." [...] The $25 Million campaign worked in conjunction to the ongoing media interest in the bra. Although Playtex promoted the authenticity of their [...] "One and Only Wonderbra", the rapid introduction of competitive products meant that the overall U.S. market benefited from a 43% increase in push-up bra sales by the end of 1994.|$|E

500|$|... "Angel of Death" [...] caused outrage among Holocaust survivors, as well {{as their}} {{families}} and the general public. The controversy led to accusations of Nazi sympathizing which have followed Slayer throughout their career. People took Hanneman's interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals, his most prized item being a German Knight's Cross, as evidence of sympathizing. Hanneman objected, stating: [...] According to guitarist Kerry King: [...] "Yeah, 'Slayer are Nazis, fascists, Communists'—all that fun shit. And of course we got the most flak for it in Germany. I was always like, 'Read the lyrics <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what's offensive about it. Can you see it as a documentary, or do you think Slayer's preaching fucking World War II?' People get this thought in their heads—especially in Europe—and you'll never talk them out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Tillman {{told the}} Senate, [...] "as {{governor}} of South Carolina, I proclaimed that, although I {{had taken the}} oath of office to support the law and enforce it, I would lead a mob to lynch any man, black or white, who ravished a woman, black or white." [...] He told his colleagues, [...] "I have three daughters, but, so help me God, I had rather find either one of them killed by a tiger or a bear [...] than to have her crawl to me <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> the horrid story that she had been robbed of the jewel of her womanhood by a black fiend." [...] In 1907, he told the senators about the Ellenton riot of 1876, [...] "it was then that we shot them; it was then that we killed them; it was then that we stuffed the ballot-boxes." ...|$|E
500|$|York manager McEwan {{compared}} Donaldson to Paulo Wanchope in September 2006, but following York's 2–0 away defeat against Oxford United {{later that}} month, McEwan criticised Donaldson's selfishness in attack, saying it cost them the match. In late 2006, Donaldson became {{subject of much}} transfer speculation. Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mick McCarthy watched him in York's 1–0 home victory over Altrincham, in which he scored his 12th goal of the season, on 5 November 2006. He was also watched by Scottish Premier League club Hibernian. In response to this speculation, Donaldson said: [...] "I don't read too much into the speculation. I've heard it before and nothing has happened so I will just keep my head down and enjoy my football until a point comes when the manager or board come <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> they have had an offer they want to consider".|$|E

500|$|Because of {{his many}} {{absences}} from home, on parliamentary and other business, Richard Cobden was a somewhat remote figure to his daughters, although his letters indicate that he felt warmly towards them and that he wished to direct their political education. In later years they would all acknowledge his influence over their ideas. Both parents impressed on the girls their responsibilities for the poor in the local community; Jane Cobden's 1864 diary records visits to homes and workhouses. She and her younger sister Anne, at the ages of 12 and 10 respectively, taught classes in the local village school. [...] The girls were encouraged by their father to contribute what money they possessed to relieve local poverty: [...] "Do not keep the money... as you have now made up your minds {{to give it to}} poor sufferers, let your own neighbours have it. Your Mama will tell you how to dispose of it, <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all about it".|$|E
500|$|In April 2002, Hewson {{was one of}} {{the leaders}} of an effort which {{delivered}} over a million postcards demanding that the facility be shut down; recipients included British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prince Charles, and Norman Askew, head of British Nuclear Fuels Limited. (The message to the first said, [...] "Tony, look me in the eye <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> I'm safe.") She personally delivered a giant postcard to Blair at 10Downing Street. The Shut Sellafield Campaign had its postcards stocked in Superquinn and Dunnes Stores supermarkets, and Hewson publicly engaged Tesco when they refused to do the same. The campaign was backed by celebrities, including Ronan Keating and Samantha Mumba, and Hewson made many newspaper and radio appearances on its behalf. It was the first prolonged exposure Hewson had to the public eye, after two decades of mostly being focused upon maintaining her privacy. Her continued activism also meant that she too would not always be around for the couple's children.|$|E
500|$|Casting for {{the film}} became a hot topic. When Sean Penn met Malick, he told him, [...] "Give me a dollar <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> where to show up". Scripts were also sent to Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall and Tom Cruise. In 1995, once word went out that Malick was making another movie after many years, {{numerous}} actors approached him, flooding the casting directors until they had to announce they wouldn't be accepting more requests. Some A-list actors including Brad Pitt, Al Pacino, Gary Oldman, and George Clooney offered {{to work for a}} fraction and some even offered to work for free. Bruce Willis even went as far as offering to pay for first-class tickets for the casting crew, to get a few lines for the movie. At Medavoy's home in 1995, Malick staged a reading with Martin Sheen delivering the screen directions, and Kevin Costner, Will Patton, Peter Berg, Lukas Haas, and Dermot Mulroney playing the main roles. In June of that year, a five-day workshop was scheduled at Medavoy's with Pitt dropping by, and culminating with Malick putting on the soundtrack of Where Eagles Dare and playing Japanese taiko drums. Malick met with an interested Johnny Depp about the project at the Book Soup Bistro on the Sunset Strip.|$|E

500|$|The {{show was}} punctuated by fantasy {{sequences}} {{in which his}} character performed his thoughts as a stand-up routine in a small club. In the commentary and the interview on the DVD, Bathurst says that {{he was told that}} they would be re-shot after filming everything else, an idea abandoned because of the expense. He has an idea of re-filming the sequences 'now', as his older self, to give them a more retrospective feeling. He has also said that he believes Mark was too [...] "designery" [...] and wishes that he had [...] "roughened him up a bit". The role is his favourite of his whole career; he has described it as [...] "the most enjoyable job I will ever do" [...] and considers several episodes of the series to be [...] "timeless, beautifully constructed farces which will endure". Bathurst is often recognised for his appearance in this series, mentioning that [...] "Drunks stop me on public transport <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> details of the plot of their favourite episode". As punishment for arriving late for the series one press launch at the Café Royal in Regent Street, London, writer Steven Moffat pledged to write an episode in which Mark is naked throughout. To a large extent, this vow is realised in the second series.|$|E
500|$|... "The Day We Died" [...] has {{generally}} received positive reviews from television critics. Sam McPherson from TV Overmind graded the finale with an A, writing [...] "From a show {{known for its}} mindbending episodes came the most mindbending episode of all. 'The Day We Died'... not only reinvigorated the show's fantastic (but inevitably aging) premise, but gave the show a breath of life that has me waiting -- no, begging -- for the show's fourth season." [...] Though he wouldn't call the finale the best Fringe episode yet, McPherson referred to the season as {{the best of the}} three and [...] "probably the best season of television that's aired in recent years". Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker lauded the finale, commenting in his review's conclusion [...] "Consider about the whole arc of this season <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> this wasn’t one of the most moving, thrilling, funny, inspiring chunks of television you’ve watched. The performances by Noble, Torv, and Jackson were extraordinarily adroit, never showy or merely clever. I was so glad that, by season’s end, Jackson/Peter had once again taken center-stage — a central importance — to a season that, by the nature of its design, needed to concentrate a lot on Walter(s) and Olivia(s)." ...|$|E
500|$|Shakira was {{mindful of}} the many critics who would judge her second album, because of the [...] "phenomenon" [...] label applied to her. She knew that some would say that [...] "she had changed too much" [...] and others would reproach her if she {{remained}} the same. [...] "All I could do was to be myself. I understood that all I {{had to do was}} write the music I knew how to write and to write from the heart when I was compelled to. In that way, everything developed naturally, more so than I could have imagined", she said. In addition, Shakira insisted on perfection, working on the material to the point of exhaustion. [...] "I made two or three demos of each song. I became a human being so demanding of myself that until the song made my hair stand on end, I wouldn't stop". For the recording of Dónde Están los Ladrones? they were used old amplifiers to achieve a better sound, a German microphone with more than 40 years of existence and made several innovations in the instrumental mixes. Dónde Están los Ladrones? took nine months to produce in total, since more people worked on the album compared with her previous record. Shakira commented, [...] "To me it's a normal time, the gestation period for a baby. But many people wag their finger <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that the next one cannot take so long..." ...|$|E
