At home, too, he was busy in the same cause. In 1670 Samuel Parker's Ecclesiastical Polity attacked the Nonconformists with clumsy intolerance. Owen <b>answered</b> <b>him</b> (Truth and Innocence Vindicated); Parker replied offensively. Then Andrew Marvell finally disposed of Parker with banter and satire in The Rehearsal Transposed. Owen himself produced a tract On the Trinity (1669), and Christian Love and Peace (1672).|$|E
500|$|The first four, sixth, seventh, {{and eighth}} films were scripted by Steve Kloves; Rowling {{assisted}} {{him in the}} writing process, ensuring that his scripts did not contradict future books in the series. She told Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) certain secrets about their characters before they were revealed in the books. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) asked her if Harry died {{at any point in}} the series; Rowling <b>answered</b> <b>him</b> by saying, [...] "You have a death scene", thereby not explicitly answering the question. Director Steven Spielberg was approached to direct the first film, but dropped out. The press has repeatedly claimed that Rowling played a role in his departure, but Rowling stated that she had no say in who directed the films and would not have vetoed Spielberg. Rowling's first choice for the director had been Monty Python member Terry Gilliam, but Warner Bros. wanted a family-friendly film and chose Columbus.|$|E

[...] "My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union." [...] Lincoln's statement angered abolitionists; William Seward's wife Frances complained to her husband that Lincoln had made it seem [...] "that the mere keeping together a number of states is more important than human freedom." [...] Greeley felt Lincoln had not truly <b>answered</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "but I'll forgive him everything if he'll issue the proclamation". When Lincoln did, on September 22, Greeley hailed the Emancipation Proclamation as a [...] "great boon of freedom".

2500|$|The {{visit to}} Earth {{begins with a}} deeply pessimistic {{appraisal}} of humanity. [...] The six absurd people the prince encountered earlier comprise, according to the narrator, just about the entire adult world. [...] On earth there were"111 kings [...] [...] [...] 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men; that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups."Since the prince landed in a desert, he believed that Earth was uninhabited. He then met a yellow snake that claimed to {{have the power to}} return him to his home, if he ever wished to return. The prince next met a desert flower, who told him that she had only seen a handful of men {{in this part of the}} world and that they had no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives. After climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped to see the whole of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the enormous, desolate landscape. When the prince called out, his echo <b>answered</b> <b>him,</b> which he interpreted as the mocking voices of others.|$|E
2500|$|Reading the {{prohibition}} of non-Jews eating the Passover sacrifice in [...] and , the Gemara told {{the tale of a}} certain Syrian non-Jew who used to eat of the Passover sacrifices in Jerusalem, boasting that [...] says, “There shall no alien eat thereof,” and [...] says, “No uncircumcised person shall eat thereof,” yet he ate of the very best. Rabbi Judah ben Bathyra asked him whether he had ever eaten of the fat tail, and the Syrian replied that he had not. So Rabbi Judah ben Bathyra told the Syrian that the next time he went to Jereusalem for Passover, he should ask them to give him the fat tail. So when the Syrian went up, he asked them for the fat-tail. They <b>answered</b> <b>him</b> that the fat-tail belongs to God (and is burnt on the altar) and asked him who told him to ask for it. The Syrian told them that Rabbi Judah ben Bathyra had done so. Their suspicions aroused, they investigated who the Syrian was, discovered that he was not a Jew, and killed him. Then they sent a message to Rabbi Judah ben Bathyra saying that he was in Nisibis (in northern Mesopotamia), yet his net was spread in Jerusalem..|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in {{the name}} of Rabbi Jonathan that Abraham's servant Eliezer made an {{improper}} request when in [...] he asked God to grant that the young woman whom he would ask to draw water for him and who replied by offering also to water his camels might be the one whom God had decreed for Isaac. Rabbi Samuel asked {{what would have happened if}} she had happened to be lame or blind, and concluded that Eliezer was fortunate that Providence <b>answered</b> <b>him</b> by sending Rebekah to meet him. Rabbi Samuel compared Eliezer's request to the improvident oaths that Saul made in 1 Samuel [...] when he promised his daughter to the man who would kill Goliath and that Jephthah made in [...] when he promised to sacrifice whatever came out of his house to meet him on his return. Similarly, a Midrash taught that Abraham's servant was one of four who asked improperly — Eliezer, Caleb, Saul, and Jepthah. The Midrash asked: What if a slave woman had done as Eliezer had asked? Yet the Midrash taught that God prepared Rebekah for him and granted his request in a fitting manner. And Rav cited Eliezer's request in [...] along with the omen sought by Jonathan in [...] as forms of improper acts of divination.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Kebra Nagast of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Pharaoh's {{daughter}} tricked Solomon into committing idolatry {{by making}} him swear an oath. In the text {{she was upset}} that he has slept with the Queen of Sheba and fathered Menyelek (who is held to have taken the Arc of the Covenant with him when the Queen returned with him to Africa). Solomon at first resists her calls saying [...] "I will neither sacrifice to nor worship thine idols, and I will not perform thy wish." [...] So [...] "one day she beautified and scented herself for him, and she behaved herself haughtily towards him, and treated him disdainfully. And he said unto her, [...] "What shall I do? Thou hast made thy face evil towards me, and thy regard towards me is not as it was formerly, and thy beautiful form is not as enticing as usual. Ask me, and I will give thee whatsoever thou wishest, and I will perform it for thee, so that thou mayest make thy face (or, attitude) gracious towards me as formerly"; but she held her peace and <b>answered</b> <b>him</b> never a word. And he repeated to her the words {{that he would do}} whatsoever she wished, and she said unto him, [...] "Swear to me by the God of Israel that thou wilt not play me false." [...] And he swore to her that he would give her whatsoever she asked for, and that he would do for her everything that she told him. And she tied a scarlet thread on the middle of the door of [...] her gods, and she brought three locusts and set them in the house of her gods. And she said unto Solomon, [...] "Come to me without breaking the scarlet thread, bend thyself and kill these locusts before me and pull out their necks"; and he did so. And she said unto him, [...] "I will henceforward do thy will, for thou hast sacrificed to my gods and hast worshipped them." [...] Now he had done thus because of his oath, so that he might not break his oath which she had made him to swear, even though he knew that it was an offence (or, sin) to enter into the house of her gods." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara {{explained}} that when Jews recite the Shema, they recite the words, [...] "blessed be {{the name of}} God's glorious Kingdom for ever and ever," [...] quietly between the words, [...] "Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one," [...] from [...] and the words, [...] "And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might," [...] from [...] {{for the reason that}} Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish expounded when he explained what happened in [...] That verse reports, [...] "And Jacob called to his sons, and said: ‘Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what will befall you in the end of days.'" [...] According to Rabbi Simeon, Jacob wished to reveal to his sons what would happen in the end of the days, but just then, the Shechinah departed from him. So Jacob said that perhaps, Heaven forefend, he had fathered a son who was unworthy to hear the prophecy, just as Abraham had fathered Ishmael or Isaac had fathered Esau. But his sons <b>answered</b> <b>him</b> (in the words of [...] ), [...] "Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One," [...] explaining that just as there was only One in Jacob's heart, so there was only One in their hearts. And Jacob replied, [...] "Blessed be the name of God's glorious Kingdom for ever and ever." [...] The Rabbis considered that Jews might recite [...] "Blessed be the name of God's glorious Kingdom for ever and ever" [...] aloud, but rejected that option, as Moses did not say those words in [...] The Rabbis considered that Jews might not recite those words at all, but rejected that option, as Jacob did say the words. So the Rabbis ruled that Jews should recite the words quietly. Rabbi Isaac taught that the School of Rabbi Ammi said that one can compare this practice to that of a princess who smelled a spicy pudding. If she revealed her desire for the pudding, she would suffer disgrace; but if she concealed her desire, she would suffer deprivation. So her servants brought her pudding secretly. Rabbi Abbahu taught that the Sages ruled that Jews should recite the words aloud, so as not to allow heretics to claim that Jews were adding improper words to the Shema. But in Nehardea, where there were no heretics so far, they recited the words quietly.|$|E
