Backish {{was talking to}} a professor, by the name of Caspar Rene Gregory, who, after he died in World War I, inspired him organize an expedition for the retrieval of biblical documents. Standish considered himself too old, so he asked Kelsey to lead it. Kelsey agreed and fundraising started, being quite <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> last time. For some reason investors found archaeology a bit more intriguing than organs. Backish would prove to be helpful through the entire process, assisting with financial issues and navigating in Europe when the World War I had just ended. This first expedition would start by ship from the East Coast to Glasgow, making its way to London, then Paris and eventually towards Constantinople, Near East, and Asia Minor. The entire expedition was expected to take two years, one for exploration and the other for writing and research which would be done between London and Paris since at the time, that is where the only copies of other ancient manuscripts were located. While originally Backish suggested that the main objective be for the retrieval of biblical texts, it was also brought up that documentation of the battlefields that Julius Caesar fought on should also be researched and heavily photographed. Overall the expedition was a huge success, Kelsey returned with Isabelle and Easton to Ann Arbor in 1921 to resume teaching and to even more renown than before. He would go on a second expedition in 1927 that would yield even more antiquities and papyrus, specifically from Egypt. Unfortunately just after returning from his last expedition he started feeling chest pains.|$|E
40|$|Patents {{are often}} taken as an {{indicator}} to measure innovativeness, because they are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to obtain <b>than</b> most others. There is a complication though, which is that patents are not a direct measure of innovativeness: the fit between patents and innovativeness is biased by differing propensities to patent. The propensity to patent was analyzed in the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s, but results vary and more recent research focuses mostly at specific case studies. With {{the availability of the}} CIS (Community Innovation Survey) databases of 2000 and 2004 there is a good opportunity to test again, in a structured way, which factors are important for the propensity to patent. For this research CIS data from three North-Western European countries were analyzed: Belgium, Norway and Germany. Descriptive results show that the propensity to patent varies greatly among different types of innovation, and especially when looking at the difference between goods, services and processes. Process and service innovations turn out to be rarely patented, with average patent propensities of respectively 7. 6 % and 9. 6 %. Moreover, descriptive results confirm that the propensity to patent differs across industries. Next to that a logistic regression analysis was performed. This analysis tested existing hypotheses and explored new factors that came available in the CIS questionnaires. By only including those enterprises in the analysis that actually had innovative output, factors could be determined that increase the propensity to patent these innovations. Factors that were found significantly relevant include EU funding (+), having a new to market innovation (+), cooperation arrangements with universities (+), having a local/regional market (-), having a market outside Europe (+) and using private R&D institutions as information sources for innovation (-). On top of those it was confirmed that patent propensity is higher in specific industries and countries, as well as for different types of innovation, even when correcting for the aforementioned factors. Results provide a comprehensive overview of the importance of, and some correlations between, firm level, industry level and country level factors of the propensity to patent. These results can be used to improve patent based innovation measures, as well as to provide additional insights into appropriability conditions between sectors.

40|$|There are ever-more, ever-larger {{research}} universities across the world. These, though,are characterised by waning conceptual vigour and creativity. More, it turns out, means less. There is strong empirical evidence for this, which the paper elaborates. The {{decline in the}} short-run extends from the late 1980 s. In a much more sweeping historical sense, it extends from the late 1920 s. It affects both {{the arts and the}} sciences. Having reviewed the empirical indicators of decline, which are striking, the paper goes on to explore the more testing question of what it is that explains the decline. It briefly reviews the larger social conditions for high-level creativity. It suggests a number of key factors that stimulate and deflate the collective social imagination. What this supposes is that the creative power of societies, and key institutions, including universities, waxes and wanes over time. It is cyclical. While the expressions of this are different in different national settings the outcome is much the same across the board when we focus on high-level creation. This means that, in truth, our era is not a very interesting one. This is so no matter how much money is spent on universities and no matter how many students they enrol and no matter how many PhDs are produced. To offset this narrative of decline, the paper sets out a model of the causes of creative surges in the arts and sciences. The paper discusses the central role that objection-creation and paradox play in this. We know when the collective imagination is roused. The desire for object-creation is widespread. This is accompanied by a pervasive love of form, pattern and figure and the correlated command of irony, metaphor and apposition. Societies and eras that master such media of imagination on a large scale exhibit a high degree of inventiveness in the arts and sciences, a formidable scale of innovation and entrepreneurialism in business, and produce ingenious models of social prosperity. The paper asks what kind of university would fit into this picture. The answer is a university that is dominated by an ethos of objection-creation rather than one of dissemination.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{addressing}} {{the possibility for}} use of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) in bridge constructions in Norway. The aim is to design an FRP section that can perform as both structural support and decking on the bridge, {{in a similar way}} as often is done with concrete. The advances of using FRP composites is {{that it is possible to}} make the bridge sections <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> lighter, and consequently possible to fabricate them in remote locations and transport them to the construction site. This will make the time necessary for construction on site <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> shorter in cases where old bridges need replacement. To make FRP-composite bridges economically feasible it is necessary to make a section that can be reproduced many times over, as much of the cost of a composite section is in the making of formwork. Making a standardized section will hopefully also bring down the time and cost of engineering the bridge. In this thesis, the focus is on a standardized section that can be used on bridges up to 10 meters in span. In Norway, there are 18 199 bridges, and approximately 10 000 of these are under 10 meters, which means that there is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to be gained from standardizing with these constraints. In FRP composites, low elasticity modulus (Young’s modulus) [1] gives problems with deflection long before the loads are high enough to give problems with strength. This is opposite of what is the case with materials as concrete and steel were strength of the material often becomes a problem before the maximum deflection. In a stiffness based design of a bridge, the deflection requirement is given by The Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA), who is the governing authority on the construction and building of bridges in Norway. Through their manuals, they give requirements for how a bridge shall behave under different circumstances. The N 400 manual[2] is the most specific for bridge construction, and specifies that a bridge should maximum deflect L/ 350. In the case of a 10 -meter bridge that gives a deflection of maximum 28, 6 millimeters. Using finite element analysis and application of theory as well as material data from laboratory testing, this thesis will try to fulfill this requirement. The conclusion of this thesis is that it is possible to produce a standardized composite element consisting of several identical items glued together for use as bridge decking together with edge beams. This bridge construction is very light weight, in fact so light that adding asphalt will triple its weight. It is a wish from the NPRA to make standardized alternatives in different materials to see which is the most efficient in terms of execution time and price. FRP composites is a lighter alternative so that transport from fabrication and storage, out to the mounting site is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to execute <b>than</b> for heavier material as concrete and steel. It is also easier to maintain, as there is no steel beams, reinforcing steel or steel bearings in the bridge that can corrode...|$|R
