5|$|Since the 1996–97 season, European Sports Media have {{awarded the}} Golden Shoe {{based on a}} points system that allows players in tougher leagues to win even if they score fewer goals than a player in a weaker league. The {{weightings}} {{are determined by the}} league's ranking on the UEFA coefficients, which in turn depend on the results of each league's clubs in European competition over the previous five seasons. Goals scored in the top five leagues according to the UEFA coefficients list are multiplied by <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> of two, goals scored in the leagues ranked six to 21 are multiplied by <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> of 1.5, and goals scored in leagues ranked 22 and below are multiplied by <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> of 1. Thus, goals scored in higher ranked leagues will count for more than those scored in weaker leagues. Since this change, there was only been one winner was not playing in one of the top five leagues (Henrik Larsson, 2000–01 Scottish Premier League).|$|E

These factors linked one another to affect systematically a riot problem in Three Southern Frontier Provinces and {{the centre of the}} problem was <b>a</b> religious <b>factor.</b> The purposes of this research were these: (1) to investigate the background of a riot problem in Three Southern Frontier Provinces, (2) to investigate cultural dimensions used for solving a riot problem in Three Southern Frontier Provinces and (3) to investigate a cultural management model by means of peace for solving a riot problem in Three Southern Frontier Provinces. Approach: Research areas consisted of 7 villages in Narathiwas Province, 6 villages in Pattani Province and 5 villages in Yala Province. These are crisis areas and there are some youth who had ever participated in “San Jai Thai Su Jai Tai ” Project (a project for supporting people who affected by the riot) have lived in. A population was people in 18 villages of Three Southern Frontier Province.

This introduces some doubt on the relevance of the level and slope interpretations of factors in term structure models.
