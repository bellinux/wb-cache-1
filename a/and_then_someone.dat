500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{development}} of the song by NME.com, vocalist Chris Martin said, [...] "From that version, [...] we went and did a whole other version of it. A whole other song. What happened with the song 'Talk' is that it was all going great <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> said 'That should be the first single' and we all just freaked out and scrapped it all. [...] We’ve just mixed it and it sounds great. I think we’ve had such pain getting to that place, I’m not sure anyone quite knows {{what to do with it}} anymore. When we heard it mixed properly, it sounded mega." ...|$|E
500|$|Blink-182 first {{performed}} [...] "Feeling This" [...] alongside {{other new}} songs from Blink-182 during their performances at the 2003 Reading and Leeds festivals. The band picked [...] "Feeling This" [...] {{as the first}} single because they felt it representative of the transition they had undergone since their fourth studio album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). A slightly different version of the song had been released previously {{as part of the}} soundtrack for the video game Madden NFL 2004 under the erroneous title [...] "Action". Barker explained in an interview that [...] "'Action' just sounded kind of dorky to us. Like we would always call it 'Feeling This' <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> at our label, I think, like wrote it as 'Action' one time and sent out singles to people. And it was always supposed to be 'Feeling This'." ...|$|E
500|$|Ed Boon {{recalled}} that for {{six out of}} the eight months {{while they were in}} production of the original Mortal Kombat, [...] "nobody could come up with a name nobody didn't hate". Some of the names suggested included [...] "Kumite", [...] "Dragon Attack", [...] "Death Blow" [...] and just [...] "Fatality". Someone had written down [...] "combat" [...] on the drawing board for the names in Boon's office <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> wrote a K over the C, according to Boon, [...] "just to be kind of weird". Steve Ritchie, a pinball designer at that time, was sitting in Boon's office and saw the word [...] "Kombat" [...] and said to Boon, 'Why don't you name it Mortal Kombat?' and that name [...] "just stuck". Since then, the series uses the letter [...] "K" [...] in place of [...] "C" [...] for various words containing the hard C sound. According to Boon, during the MK games' development they usually spell the words correctly and only [...] "korrect it" [...] when one of the developers points out they should do it.|$|E

500|$|Concerning inspirations on the season, Loeb {{revealed}} that [...] "Chinatown... {{is one of}} the things that influenced Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos when they created the character. So those kind of beautiful, long, wide expansive shots, where people sort of come into frame and go back out of frame and someone’s in the foreground <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> is way in the background and they’re having a conversation, that’s the stuff that makes it interesting." [...] Director of Photography Manuel Billeter and episodic director S. J. Clarkson took inspiration from the comics in terms of their color palette, while looking to the works of Wong Kar-wai as reference to create [...] "unconventional" [...] compositions, with Billeter explaining, [...] "There were a lot of foreground elements [...] headroom as well, and we never wanted to show an open frame. We wanted to create a sense of claustrophobia." [...] Billeter shot the season with a Red Epic Dragon camera in 4K resolution, with 5K used for some visual effects shots, and with Panavision PVintage lenses; he focused mostly on static frames and [...] "good composition", but did occasionally employ a camera dolly or steadicam. For lighting, Billeter noted that many New York street lamps had been changed from sodium-vapor lamps to LEDs, so he tried to recreate the [...] "warm, dirty color of sodium vapor" [...] for night exterior scenes.|$|E

[...] "I Miss You" [...] was commissioned as the record's second single in December 2003 when the band recorded a music video for it. [...] "I Miss You" [...] became arguably the most successful single from the album, becoming Blink-182's second number one hit on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart during the week of April 3, 2004, until dethroned by Hoobastank's [...] "The Reason" [...] two weeks later.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} year of {{development}} the team focused mostly on the gameplay without any narrative structure. Playtesters found the game to be fun but asked about what these test chambers were leading towards. This prompted to team {{to come up with a}} narrative for Portal. The Portal team worked with Half-Life series writer Marc Laidlaw on fitting the game into the series' plot. This was done, in part, due to the limited art capabilities of the small team; instead of creating new assets for Portal, they decided to tie the game to an existing franchise—Half-Life—to allow them to reuse the Half-Life 2 art assets. Wolpaw and Faliszek were put to work on the dialogue for Portal. The concept of a computer AI guiding the player through experimental facilities to test the portal gun was arrived at early in the writing process. They drafted early lines for the yet-named [...] "polite" [...] AI with humorous situations, such as requesting the player's character to [...] "assume the party escort submission position", and found this style of approach to be well-suited to the game they wanted to create, ultimately leading to the creation of the GLaDOS character. GLaDOS was central to the plot, as Wolpaw notes [...] "We designed the game to have a very clear beginning, middle, and end, and we wanted GLaDOS to go through a personality shift at each of these points." [...] Wolpaw further describes the idea of using cake as the reward came about as [...] "at the beginning of the Portal development process, we sat down as a group to decide what philosopher or school of philosophy our game would be based on. That was followed by about 15 minutes of silence <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> mentioned that a lot of people like cake." [...] The cake element along with additional messages given to the player in the behind-the-scenes areas were written and drawn by Kim Swift.|$|E

2500|$|The band did not tour {{in support}} of the album. Hollis explained, [...] "There is no way that I could ever play again {{a lot of the stuff}} I played on this album because I just wouldn't know how to. So, to play it live, to take a part that was done in spontaneity, to write it down <b>and</b> <b>then</b> get <b>someone</b> to play it, would lose the whole point, lose the whole purity of what it was in the first place." [...] The band would never tour again.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{relational}} transgressions {{is also important}} in understanding hurt. Relational transgressions occur when people violate implicit or explicit relational rules. For instance, if someone believes that their romantic partner should be sexually faithful and emotionally faithful, loyal, <b>and</b> honest, <b>then</b> when <b>someone</b> violates {{one or more of}} these standards, they have committed a relational transgression.|$|R
2500|$|Naomi Clark was {{initially}} {{developed by the}} series' original show-runner, Rob Thomas, who was succeeded by Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah prior to the premiere. Early press releases described the character as a privileged, attractive, and popular teenager, prompting the media to draw comparisons to Kelly Taylor of Beverly Hills, 90210, the first series of the franchise which launched 90210. As production of the spin-off began, the part would become more defined, with actress AnnaLynne McCord, who received the role, labeling Naomi an intelligent girl who possessed both manipulative and sensitive sides. She further described the character as [...] "kind of a chameleon", stating that [...] "she'll be someone with the principal <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> else with her mother <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>someone</b> else with her friend." ...|$|E

The fire died down <b>and</b> <b>then</b> brightened; the shadows darkened <b>and</b> <b>then</b> lightened. <b>Someone</b> now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> got up to throw on wood. The thump of hobbled hoofs sounded out in the darkness. The wind was still and the coyotes were gone. She could no longer open her eyes. They seemed glued shut. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> gradually all sense of the night and the wild, of the drowsy warmth, faded.|$|R

50|$|This is {{what the}} Avaya press release terms “extension to cellular,” and some other vendors term “PBX extension.” The cell phone number is entered into the PBX (or third party PBX {{mobility}} device, see the paragraph below headed “PBX agnostic”), <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>someone</b> calls the related office number, the PBX dials a cell phone over the PSTN and bridges the call. The PBX treats the cell phone {{as if it is}} an analog extension, so PBX can invoke features like hold and transfer by touch-tone commands. Thus, one can use any cell phone and any carrier (see the paragraphs below headed “handset agnostic” and “carrier agnostic”).|$|R

40|$|Research on prescreening {{processes}} {{in decision making}} was extended by manipulating task valence {{in a series of}} three experiments. In Experiments 1 and 2, half the subjects had the "positive " task of screening <b>and</b> <b>then</b> selecting <b>someone</b> to hire for a job and half had the "negative " task of screening <b>and</b> <b>then</b> selecting <b>someone</b> to fire, where the choice options (worker descriptions) were the same in each task. In Experiment 1 some subjects were instructed to list options they would include for further consideration and some were instructed to list options they would exclude from further consideration. More options were screened out in the inclusion condition than in the exclusion condition and in the firing task than in the hiring task. Subjects in Experiment 2 were allowed to decide for themselves whether to use inclusion or exclusion in screening options. The main results from Experiment 1 were replicated. Also, subjects in the hiring task were more likely than subjects in the firing task to select inclusion as a strategy for prescreening options. In Experiment 3 the positive task involved adding stocks to a portfolio following an unexpected financial gain and the negative task involved disposing of stocks following a financial setback. Again, more options were screened out by subjects selecting the inclusion strategy than by exclusion subjects, but differences between the positive and negative tasks were not found. Results were explained in terms of a "status quo " bias for adding or deleting options that transcends task differences and a positivity bias in judging people that distinguishes judgments in different task domains...|$|R

Jimmy felt obscurely the lack of an audience: the wit was flashing. Play ran very high and paper began to pass. Jimmy did not know exactly who was winning but {{he knew that he was}} losing. But it was his own fault for he frequently mistook his cards and the other men had to calculate his I.O.U.'s for him. They were devils of fellows but he wished they would stop: it was getting late.

500|$|Washington {{also claimed}} that American University cut off {{contact with him}} after he punched Tomjanovich. However, {{this appears to be}} a {{misrepresentation}} of certain events. When he tried to become athletic director of American in 1995, the school offered to hire him as assistant to the athletic director, since Washington had no front office experience. When confronted about this Washington stated: [...] "I didn't see why I couldn't be the AD so they could use my name out front <b>and</b> <b>then</b> have <b>someone</b> with more experience be my assistant." [...] John Feinstein and others have suggested that the most lasting damage caused by the fight between Washington and Tomjanovich has been to Washington's self-image, and his supposed refusal to accept responsibility for his actions in that fight. Pat later said it went deeper than that, as when she met him in college: ...|$|R
50|$|John Sullivan {{became a}} scenery shifter at the BBC in 1974 {{because of his}} desire to write a sitcom outline he had called Citizen Smith; fearing {{rejection}} if he sent the idea in, he {{decided it would be}} better to get a job, any job, at the BBC, learn more about the business <b>and</b> <b>then</b> meet <b>someone</b> who would actually take notice of his as yet unwritten script. After he approached producer Dennis Main Wilson, the first Citizen Smith script was written. Main Wilson loved the script and saw the potential for a series and it was put into production almost immediately as a pilot for Comedy Special - a showcase for new talent which had succeeded Comedy Playhouse - under the title Citizen Smith. The pilot was a success, and four series and a Christmas special were produced between 1977 and 1980.|$|R

About two o'clock I heard two horses come into the Parson's yard. I called Squire Thorndyke, who went upstairs to an open window; presently someone came and tried the back door. I heard voices outside, but could not hear what was said. The Squire came down and called me upstairs. I went up and took my place at {{one side of the}} window, and the Squire took his on the other.

The night seemed endless. At last a greater chilliness of the air {{told them that the}} dawn was at hand; gradually the darkness seemed to thin away into a cold pallor, and above a bank of cloud in the east appeared a sickly light. More anxiously than ever our eyes turned towards Rome; the mist hid the country from us, but some of the watchers thought they saw a black mass, far away. They pointed it out to the others, and all watched eagerly; but the black mass grew neither larger nor clearer nor nearer; and as great yellow rays shot up above the clouds, and the sun rose slowly, we saw the road stretched out before us, and it was empty, empty, empty.|$|E
