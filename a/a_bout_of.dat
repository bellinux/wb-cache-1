5|$|Accounts by 19th-century historians {{suggest that}} Day grew {{impatient}} with the girls when they became bored with their lessons and began to squabble, and that he also spent significant time nursing them through <b>a</b> <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> smallpox. These accounts may have been exaggerated as both girls had been inoculated against smallpox, and their strict upbringing meant {{they would not have}} rebelled excessively.|$|E

30|$|Although {{responses}} to CRP are inconsistent, <b>a</b> single <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> exercise {{can increase the}} activity of both circulating IL- 6 and neutrophil counts in untrained adults.

30|$|Acute effects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> {{exercise}} inducing no or just mild muscle {{damage on}} glucose tolerance and insulin resistance {{seem to be}} primarily energy expenditure dependent whereas acute anti-inflammatory activity induced by <b>a</b> single <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> exercise appears to be rather exercise type dependent.|$|R
40|$|Purpose Fish {{oils and}} related fatty acid {{components}} have anti-inflammatory properties, with beneficial effects against various {{disorders such as}} cardiovascular disease. <b>A</b> single <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> exercise can alter immune function. However, the effects of fish oil on immune function after <b>a</b> single <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> exercise are currently unknown. This study investigated the effect of supplementation with fish oil on the immune response to <b>an</b> acute <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> endurance exercise. Methods Sixteen male subjects underwent a six week double blind randomised placebo controlled supplementation trial involving two groups (fish oil or placebo oil, 3  g/day).

40|$|<b>A</b> short <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> high fat diet (HFD) impairs glucose {{tolerance}} and induces hepatic steatosis in mice. Here, we aimed {{to elaborate on}} long-lasting effects of short-term high fat feeding. As expected, one week of HFD significantly impaired glucose tolerance. Intriguingly, recovery feeding with a standard rodent diet for 8 weeks did not fully normalize glucose tolerance. In addition, mice exposed to <b>a</b> short <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> HFD revealed significantly increased liver fat accumulation paralleled by elevated portal free fatty acid levels after 8 weeks of recovery feeding compared to exclusively chow-fed littermates. In conclusion, <b>a</b> short <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> HFD has long-lasting effects on hepatic lipid accumulation and glucose tolerance...|$|R
