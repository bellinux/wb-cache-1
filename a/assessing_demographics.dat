40|$|Following the reestablishment {{of peace}} in war-torn Liberia, a {{door-to-door}} mental health epidemiological study sampling of 500 Liberian civil war survivors living in Monrovia was implemented in July 2010. Under the supervision of a clinical psychologist, surveys <b>assessing</b> <b>demographics,</b> posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and war trauma experiences were administered to roughly equal numbers {{of men and women}} by volunteers working for a local nongovernmental organization. From an evolutionary perspective, two hypotheses were tested based on previous research findings that linked PTSD symptoms to olfactory experiences. First, it was predicted that olfactory-related trauma would be positively correlated to higher reports of intrusive traumatic memories. Second, it was predicted that olfactory-related trauma would be positively correlated to the number of reported symptoms of hyperarousal.

40|$|Background: Physical {{activity}} {{is a principal}} intervention in primary and secondary prevention of chronic illness. While the benefits of community based rehabilitation is acknowledged,the rate of attendance and adherence remains sub optimal. Self-efficacy is acknowledged {{to be a key}} factor relating to adherence in rehabilitation but the construct of proxy efficacy, defined as one’s confidence in the skills and abilities of a third party to function effectively on another’s behalf, is less often studied. This paper examines the relationship between gender and ‘self’ and ‘proxy-efficacy’ and their potential role in attendance to a community based chronic illness rehabiliation (CBCIR) programme. Methods: Participants attending induction at the programme completed a questionnaire <b>assessing</b> <b>demographics</b> and both self (9 items) and proxy efficacy for exercise (9 items) which was assessed on a Likert scale from 0 (not confident at all) to 10 (very confident), with a higher score indicating greater efficacy.

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}} (NSAID) prescribing {{practices in}} a tertiary referral hospital. METHODS: A single time-point audit of drug kardexes and clinical notes of n = 388 patients on 2 July 2008 was carried out <b>assessing</b> <b>demographics,</b> gastrointestinal and coronary heart disease risk factors, renal function and co-prescribed medications. RESULTS: Fifty-seven of 388 (14. 7 %) hospital patients were on NSAIDs. Forty-nine were prescribed NSAID after admission. Nineteen (32. 2 %) were on regular NSAID (11 / 19 on PPI) and 38 patients were on PRN NSAID (12 / 38 on PPI). Seventeen of 49 patients were on other medications associated with gastrointestinal bleeding (10 / 17 were on PPI). Nineteen patients (33. 3 %) were > 60 years. Eight patients had three or four risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding; six were on PPI. Thirteen patients had two risks; 7 were on PPI.

40|$|Psychotherapists report {{routinely}} not practising evidence-based treatments. However, {{there is}} little research examining the content of therapy from the patient perspective. This study examined the self-reported treatment experiences of individuals who {{had been told that}} they had received cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for their eating disorder. One hundred and fifty-seven such sufferers (mean age = 25. 69 years) were recruited from self-help organisations. Participants completed an online survey <b>assessing</b> <b>demographics,</b> clinical characteristics, and therapy components. The use of evidence-based CBT techniques varied widely, with core elements for the eating disorders (e. g., weighing and food monitoring) used at well below the optimum level, while a number of unevidenced techniques were reported as being used commonly. Cluster analysis showed that participants received different patterns of intervention under the therapist label of ‘CBT’, with evidence-based CBT being the least common. Therapist age and patient diagnosis were related to the pattern of intervention delivered. It appears that clinicians are not subscribing to a transdiagnostic approach to the treatment of eating disorders. Patient recollections in this study support the conclusion that evidence-based practice is not routinely undertaken with this client group, even when the therapy offered is described as such...|$|E
40|$|Background: Efforts to {{increase}} community levels {{of physical activity}} {{through the development of}} multiuse urban trails could be strengthened by information about factors predicting trail use. This study examined whether reasons for trail use predict levels of physical activity on urban trails. Methods: Adults (N = 335) living within a 1 -mile buffer zone of urban trails in Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles completed a self-report measure <b>assessing</b> <b>demographics,</b> reason for trail use, and physical activity on the trail. Accelerometers measured total daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Environmental features of the urban trail were assessed with the Systematic Pedestrian and Cyclist Environmental Scan for trails measure. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted that accounted for clustering of individuals within trail segments. Results: After controlling for demographic and environmental factors and total daily MVPA, reasons for trail use significantly predicted recreational but not transportation activity. Recreational trail activity was greater for participants who reported exercise and health reasons for trail use as compared with other reasons (ie, social interaction, enjoying nature, walking pets) for recreational trail use. Conclusions: To increase the use of urban trails, it may be useful to promote the health and exercise benefits of recreational trail use...|$|E

Methods: Patients (N= 99) treated at the University of California, Los Angeles, for choroidal melanoma within the prior 5  years (M= 2. 05) completed questionnaires <b>assessing</b> <b>demographics,</b> cancer-related needs, vision-specific QoL, depressive symptoms and concern about recurrence. Visual acuity, comorbidities, treatment modality (radiotherapy, enucleation) and years since diagnosis were gathered from medical records. Primary analyses were multiple regressions. Results: Although concern about cancer recurrence was elevated, QoL was better than in other oncology samples and comparable with healthy samples on some outcomes. Enucleation was associated with worse vision-specific QoL, and presence of comorbid diseases was associated with worse vision-specific QoL, depressive symptoms and concern about cancer recurring (all p values 3 ̆c 0. 05).

40|$|This {{cross-cultural}} study explored along with various personality factors {{the relationship between}} laughter and disease prevalence. Previous studies have only determined the effect of laughter on various health dimensions, whereas, this study quantified the level of laughter that was beneficial or detrimental to health. There were a total of 730 participants {{between the ages of}} eighteen and thirty-nine years. 366 participants were from Aurangabad, India (AUR), and 364 participants were from Mississauga, Canada (MISS). The participants were provided a survey <b>assessing</b> <b>demographics,</b> laughter, lifestyle, subjective well-being, life satisfaction, emotional well-being and health dimensions. In AUR, a beneficial effect of laughter was mediated through moderate levels (level two) of laughter, whereas both low (level one) and high (level three) levels had no effect. Similarly, in MISS, the beneficial effect was mediated through level two, but a negative effect was also seen at level three. This could be attributable to a higher prevalence of bronchial asthma in western countries.
