5|$|King Charles's Castle {{was built}} between 1548 and 1551 {{to protect the}} Scilly Isles against French attack. Tensions with France had grown {{during the reign of}} Henry VIII <b>and</b> <b>spilled</b> over into war in 1538. Henry {{initially}} responded by fortifying the coasts of England, constructing new artillery forts designed to defend against the longer-range cannons that were becoming common in the 16th century. Henry's son, the nine-year-old Edward VI, inherited the throne in 1547, facing renewed war with France. Edward Seymour was made the Lord Protector to the King, and he appointed his brother, Thomas, as England's Lord Admiral. Thomas inspected the Scilly Isles personally and concluded that they were vulnerable to a French invasion.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} Welsh and the English persisted <b>and</b> <b>spilled</b> over in 1400 with the {{outbreak}} of the Glyndŵr Rising. It is uncertain what part the castle played in the conflict, but it seems to have survived intact. In 1416, the castle passed through Isabel le Despenser in marriage to her first husband Richard de Beauchamp, the earl of Worcester, and then to her second husband, Richard Beauchamp, the earl of Warwick. Isabel and her second husband invested heavily in the castle, conducting repairs and making it suitable for use as their main residence in the region. The castle passed to Richard Neville in 1449 and to Jasper Tudor, the earl of Pembroke, in 1486.|$|E

5|$|As the Bonneville Floods rushed {{down the}} Snake River, the Missoula Floods {{occurred}} in the same period, but farther north. The Missoula Floods, which took place more than 40 times in the time span from 15,000 to 13,000 years ago, were caused by Glacial Lake Missoula on the Clark Fork repeatedly being impounded by ice dams then breaking through, with the lake's water rushing over much of eastern Washington in massive surges far larger than the Lake Bonneville Flood. These floods pooled behind the Cascade Range into enormous lakes <b>and</b> <b>spilled</b> over the northern drainage divide of the Snake River watershed, carving deep canyons through the Palouse Hills. The Palouse River canyon was {{the largest of the}} many gorges cut through the Palouse Hills, and could not have become as large as it now is {{if it were not for}} the Missoula Floods. The Lake Bonneville Floods and the Missoula Floods helped widen and deepen the Columbia River Gorge, a giant water gap which allows water from the Columbia and Snake rivers to take a direct route through the Cascade Range to the Pacific.|$|E

Following patrol in the Tsushima Strait, she sank a small junk with gunfire on 8 April. On 18 April, {{an attack by}} two patrol boats left the submarine's interior a shambles of broken glass, smashed instruments, <b>and</b> <b>spilled</b> hydraulic oil.

Furthermore, Penman explores the theme of betrayal: Henry II considers the rebellion against him by his sons and wife as personal and political betrayal. Finally, the question of how a man reconciles personal and family needs with the demands of kingship are examined through Henry's actions as father, husband and ruler.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} between North and South Korea {{can be seen}} as more comparable to North and South Vietnam, which were also divided after independence following World War II from a colonial power (France). Unlike the Korean War, the Vietnam War spanned a much longer period <b>and</b> <b>spilled</b> over to the neighboring countries of Laos and Cambodia. The end of the war resulted in all three countries coming under control of the Communist-oriented independence movements, with China and the Soviet Union competing for influence. Relations between North and South Vietnam were also acrimonious, with North Vietnam being largely isolated and unrecognized except by other communist states, similarly to North Korea.|$|E

A second pile-up on Highway 401 near Kingston caused a rig to leaked over 300 liters of fuel into a creek. Another pile-up involving a tractor-trailer was reported on Autoroute 40 west of Montreal forcing the shutdown {{of it as the}} trailer overturned <b>and</b> <b>spilled</b> kerosene on the roadway. Autoroutes 20 and 440 and Highways 132, 138 and 175 north and east of Quebec City were shut down due to heavy and blowing snow.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, floodwaters in the Everglades region {{resulted}} in significant losses to cattle, {{and hundreds of}} small block homes in the agricultural districts were blown off their foundations. Much of the marshy country was waterlogged {{during and after the}} storm. Widespread rains of – affected the Glades region of Palm Beach County. Vegetable beds were flooded in up to several feet of water, while rural canals overflowed their banks <b>and</b> <b>spilled</b> into the Everglades. After the storm, heavy rains caused one 150-ft-long (45.7-m) section of the Herbert Hoover Dike to collapse near Canal Point, leaving 700 cattle stranded and 1,800 planted acres submerged. Floodwaters submerged Conners Highway in 30 locations and swept across a 3,000-ft (914.6-m) section, combining with debris to obstruct motorists.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} {{established}} downtowns, Ossining had been {{adversely affected by}} {{the growth of the}} automobile in the later 20th century. Local shoppers began taking advantage of improved roads to patronize stores in both enclosed shopping malls and strip malls along major highways like Route 9 outside the village's traditional center. The village used its urban renewal grants to demolish the old buildings along the south side of Main Street that year in an attempt to revitalize downtown. Its comprehensive plan drafted but never adopted two years earlier called for mixed-use development, projects to replace them. But they were never funded or undertaken, and the spaces were largely used as parking. It was the first of many plans that remained largely unrealized, as Ossining went through 15 different mayoral administrations in the remaining years of the 20th century. During the 1968–74 period downtown was also the site of several race riots that began at the high school <b>and</b> <b>spilled</b> into the streets. The community responded by redistricting its schools to ensure earlier racial integration.|$|E

25|$|Within National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT) this water-way misclassified, misnamed {{as a mere}} drain (Najafgarh drain or nallah) is, in fact, the {{continuation}} of Sahibi River and an elongation of the Najafgarh jheel Lake. Historically during the 1960s and before, the rain-fed Sahibi River which originates in Jaipur Distt. of Rajasthan passing through Alwar Distt. in Rajasthan and Gurgaon Distt. in Haryana entered U.T. of Delhi near Dhansa <b>and</b> <b>spilled</b> its overflow in the Najafgarh Jheel (lake) basin creating a seasonal lake, a vast area more than 300sq km was submerged in some seasons, this water then continued to flow {{on the other side}} forming a tributary and outfalled into River Yamuna. In the following decades this Sahibi River flow reaching Dhansa regulators was channelised by digging out a wide drain and connecting it directly to the River Yamuna, this in effect also completely drained off the seasonal Najafgarh Jheel which used to form here in the past. The drain channel from Dhansa regulators to Keshopur Bus Depot on Outer Ring Road is wide with thick and high embankments, vast amount of water is retained in this widened drain by closing the Kakrola regulators under Najafgarh Road to recharge the local ground watertable hence it acts like an elongated lake as well.|$|E

The house quickly becomes a mess and Bart goes out to play with his friends. Milhouse's toy airplane crashes into a house and Bart goes to retrieve it. While doing so, he accidentally knocks down a stone gargoyle and Belle, the owner of the house, goes to Homer and says she will not press charges but demands he be punished. Homer originally dismisses this, but Belle threatens to come back and speak with Marge, leading Homer to force Bart to do chores for Belle. Bart discovers that the house is actually a burlesque house called the Maison Derrière.|$|E
500|$|Scott and Charlene had {{problems}} {{during their first}} 12 months together and they broke up several times. One such break-up occurred after Charlene's mother thought she should date other boys, while Scott had to repeat his final year of school without her. Scott was initially unsure how to win Charlene back, but after speaking with his grandmother, Helen (Anne Haddy), who mentioned that her husband gave her a friendship ring, Scott {{went out and bought}} one for Charlene. While they were enjoying a barbecue at Charlene's caravan by Lassiter's lake, the couple argued about Charlene spending time with Warren Murphy (Ben Mendelsohn) and Scott decided to leave. When Charlene started to go after Scott, she found herself trapped by a fire that had been accidentally started by Greg Davis (Alex Papps). Greg had been storing petrol under the caravan <b>and</b> <b>spilled</b> it as he was removing the cans, causing the petrol to head towards the still burning barbecue.

500|$|Tensions {{between the}} Welsh and the English persisted <b>and</b> <b>spilled</b> over in 1400 with the {{outbreak}} of the Glyndŵr Rising. At the start of the conflict, Harlech's garrison was badly equipped, and Conwy had fallen into disrepair. Conwy Castle was taken {{at the start of the}} conflict by two Welsh brothers, who took control of the fortress in a sneak attack, enabling Welsh rebels to attack and capture the rest of the walled town. Caernarfon was besieged in 1401, and that November the Battle of Tuthill took place nearby between Caernarfon's defenders and the besieging force. In 1403 and 1404, Caernarfon was besieged again by Welsh troops with support from French forces, but withstood the attacks. Beaumaris fared less well. It was placed under siege and captured by the rebels in 1403, only being retaken by royal forces in 1405. Harlech was attacked and taken at the end of 1404, becoming Glyndŵr's military headquarters until English forces under the command of the future Henry V retook the castle in a siege over the winter of 1408–09. By 1415 the uprising had been completely crushed, but the performance of the great castles and town walls is assessed by historian Michael Prestwich to have been [...] "no more than partially successful".|$|E
