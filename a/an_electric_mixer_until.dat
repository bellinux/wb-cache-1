40|$|Egg white foam {{is a type}} of foam (a colloid {{in which}} a gas is {{dispersed}} or spread throughout a liquid) used in meringues, souffl és, and angel food cake to make them light and porous (airy). To prepare an egg white foam, egg whites are initially beaten (with a wire wisk or <b>electric</b> <b>mixer)</b> <b>until</b> they become frothy. Then an acid (such as cream of tartar) is added. Depending on the application, the beating of the egg white continues until soft (when the peaks stand straight and bend slightly at the tips) or stiff peaks (when the peaks stand straight without bending) are formed. Salt and sugar may also be added. How It Works: Egg whites are made up of water, protein, and small amounts of minerals and sugars. When the egg whites are beaten, air is added and the egg white protein, albumen, is denatured. Denaturation is the change of a protein’s shape under stress (in this case, beating). The denatured protein coats the air bubbles and holds in the water, causing them t...|$|R
50|$|In Greece, one of {{the most}} popular coffees is a {{variation}} of iced coffee called Frappé, invented by a Nescafe represenatative Dimitrios Vakondios in 1957. The preparation entails instant coffee (traditionally Nescafe), water, and optionally, sugar, together using either <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> or <b>a</b> shaker to create a foam. Subsequently, milk is optionally added followed by ice cubes, and the remainder is topped with water. It became well known outside of Greece as a result of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, during which many tourists became fond of it and an article in the Los Angeles Times was published about it.http://www.latimes.com/features/printedition/food/la-fo-frappe18aug18,1,6434354.story?coll=la-headlines-pe-food Since its founding, Frappe became a very popular drink in Cyprus, and in Romania.|$|R

25|$|Mayonnaise {{can be made}} by {{hand with}} a whisk, or fork, or with the aid of <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> or blender. It is made by slowly adding oil to an egg yolk, while whisking vigorously to {{disperse}} the oil. The oil and the water in the yolk form a base of the emulsion, while lecithin and protein from the yolk is the emulsifier that stabilizes it. A combination of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion determine the bond strength among oil droplets. The high viscosity of mayonnaise is attributed to the total strength created by these two intermolecular forces. Addition of mustard contributes to the taste and further stabilizes the emulsion, as mustard contains small amounts of lecithin. If vinegar is added directly to the yolk, it can emulsify more oil, thus making more mayonnaise.|$|R

The sand is prepared and added in weight percentage of 1 % and 2 %. It is grain size ranges between 50 - 75 um. Wettability of the mixture was increased by adding 2 gm of pure magnesium. <b>A</b> special <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> {{was used to}} disperse silica sand grains to support aluminum scrap melt (matrix). Then the composite pieces were cut to samples suitable for tension, compression, hardness, wear, impact, corrosion resistance (in sea water) and microstructure inspection. The tests {{have shown that the}} composite has more resistance to tension, compression, hardness, and wear than the base alloy. This is because sand particles are dispersed uniformly (uniformly distributed throughout the cast) which hinder the movement of the dislocations slip plane. On the other hand, the resistance to impact and corrosion (in sea water for one month) decreased slightly. In wear resistance test, pin-on-desk was used where load, sliding speed, and slide distance were kept constant. Microstructure inspection on the base alloy and the composite materials were made before and after corrosion for comparison between them.   DOI:  [URL] </p...|$|R

5000|$|Nearly 19 {{million women}} held jobs during World War II. Many {{of these women}} were already working in a lower paying job or were {{returning}} to the work force after being laid off during the depression. Only three million new female workers entered the workforce {{during the time of}} the war. Although most women took on male dominated trades during World War II, they were expected to return to their everyday housework once men returned from the war. Government campaigns targeting women were addressed solely at housewives, likely because already-employed women would move to the higher-paid [...] "essential" [...] jobs on their own, or perhaps because it was assumed that most would be housewives. One government advertisement asked women: [...] "Can you use <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>mixer?</b> If so, you can learn to operate a drill." [...] Propaganda was also directed at their husbands, many of whom were unwilling to support such jobs. Many of the women who took jobs during World War II were mothers. These women with children at home pooled together in their efforts to raise their families. They assembled into groups and shared such chores as cooking, cleaning and washing clothes. Many who did have young children shared apartments and houses so they could save time, money, utilities and food. If they both worked, they worked different shifts so they could take turns babysitting. Taking on a job during World War II made people unsure if they should urge the women to keep acting as full-time mothers, or support them getting jobs to support the country in this time of need. Being able to support the soldiers by making all different products made the women feel very accomplished and proud of their work. Over 6 million women got war jobs; African American, Hispanic, White, and Asian women worked side by side. In the book A Mouthful of Rivets Vi Kirstine Vrooman shares about the time when she decided to take action and become a riveter. She got a job building B-17s on an assembly line, she shares just how exciting it was saying, 'The biggest thrill — I can't tell you — was when the B-17s rolled off the assembly line. You can't believe the feeling we had. We did it!" [...] Once women accepted the challenge of the workforce they continued to make strong advances towards equal rights.|$|R

After removal of the peels and seeds, the residual pieces were vacuum-packed with a plastic bag and stored at − 25 °C until ready {{for use in the}} experiment. Katsura-uri drink was prepared by the following method: 500  g of frozen Katsura-uri fruit was partially thawed, chopped, and mixed by using <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> automatic <b>mixer</b> with 10.6  g of a sweetener (Pal Sweet; Ajinomoto, Tokyo, Japan).

Subjects were not informed about the characteristics of Katsura-uri, which limited their ability to distinguish between active and placebo drinks and removed bias. Thus, this study was performed under a single-blind condition. The Katsura-uri drink and the placebo were prepared on the day before each trial, and administered to subjects by pouring them into identical cups; therefore, the outward appearance of the cup did not distinguish between Katsura-uri and placebo drinks.|$|R
