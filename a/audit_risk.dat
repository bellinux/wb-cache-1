5000|$|ISA 400 Risk Assessments and Internal Control {{is one of}} the International Standards on Auditing.

5000|$|For audits {{performed}} by an outside audit firm, risk assessment {{is a crucial}} stage before accepting an audit engagement. According to ISA315 Understanding the Entity and its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement, [...] "the auditor should perform risk assessment procedures to obtain {{an understanding of the}} entity and its environment, including its internal control". Evidence relating to the auditor’s risk assessment of a material misstatement in the client’s financial statements. Then, the auditor obtains initial evidence regarding the classes of transactions at the client and the operating effectiveness of the client’s internal controls. <b>Audit</b> <b>risk</b> is defined as the risk that the auditor will issue a clean unmodified opinion regarding the financial statements, when in fact the financial statements are materially misstated, and therefore do not qualify for a clean unmodified opinion. As a formula, <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> is the product of two other risks: Risk of Material Misstatement and Detection risk. This formula can be further broken down as follows: inherent risk × control risk × detection risk.|$|E
