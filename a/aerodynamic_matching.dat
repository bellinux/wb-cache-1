40|$|A {{substantial}} {{effort has}} been made to implement an enhanced aerodynamic modeling capability in the Higher-fidelity Conceptual Design and structural optimization tool. This additional capability is needed for a rapid, physics-based method of modeling advanced aircraft concepts at risk of structural failure due to dynamic aeroelastic instabilities. To adequately predict these instabilities, in particular for transonic applications, a generalized <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>matching</b> algorithm was implemented to correct the doublet-lattice model available in Nastran using solution data from a priori computational fluid dynamics anal- ysis. This new capability is demonstrated for two tube-and-wing aircraft configurations, including a Boeing 737 - 200 for implementation validation and the NASA D 8 as a first use case. Results validate the current implementation of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>matching</b> utility and demonstrate the importance of using such a method for aircraft configurations featuring fuselage-wing aerodynamic interaction...|$|E
40|$|TutorialThe paper {{addresses}} {{the balance between}} peak attainable efficiency and overall operating range {{that must be addressed}} when specifying, designing and/or selecting centrifugal compressors. The relative roles of the various compressor components; i. e., impellers, diffusers, guide vanes, and return channels; in achieving the proper balance are discussed. Finally, the importance of proper component and stage <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>matching</b> is emphasized...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBowed-twisted stators {{with large}} camber angles have been {{developed}} to replace the conventional tandem stators in an axial transonic fan stage working at high subsonic speeds. Experimental study is carried out on both stages with tandem stators and with bowed-twisted stators. Compared to the tandem stators, the bowed-twisted stators change the distribution of the low-energy fluid and the potential high-energy fluid at the compressor outlets, reduce the endwall loss significantly, improve the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>matching</b> of rotors and stators, and eventually increase the fan stage performances. The aerodynamic performances of the fan stage at different operating points are compared and contrasted. The results show that the transonic fan stage with bowed-twisted stators has better aerodynamic performances. It is thus suggested that the bowed-twisted stators with large camber angles be popularized into the high-loaded transonic fan designs...|$|E

40|$|The {{equations}} {{governing the}} deceleration and oscillation of a blunt body moving along a planar trajectory are re-expressed {{in the form}} of the Euler-Cauchy equation. An analytic solution of this equation describes the oscillation amplitude growth and frequency dilation with time for a statically stable decelerating body with constant pitch damping. The oscillation histories for several constant pitch damping values, predicted by the solution of the Euler-Cauchy equation are compared to POST six degree-of-freedom (6 -DoF) trajectory simulations. The simulations use simplified <b>aerodynamic</b> coefficients <b>matching</b> the Euler-Cauchy approximations. Agreement between the model predictions and simulation results are excellent. Euler-Cauchy curves are also fit through nonlinear 6 -DoF simulations and ballistic range data to identify static stability and pitch damping coefficients. The model os shown to closely fit through the data points and capture the behavior of the blunt body observed in simulation and experiment. The extracted coefficients are in reasonable agreement with higher fidelity, nonlinear parameter identification results. Finally, a nondimensional version of the Euler-Cauchy equation is presented and shown to be a simple and effective tool for designing dynamically scaled experiments for decelerating blunt capsule flight...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} how the scale-model aircraft can be built when the Reynolds number is out of range for using dynamic similitude method. Due to lack of time and budget for designing an actual model for testing, Cessna 172 was {{used to calculate the}} size of the temporary scale-model aircraft. The method that was used for this project was <b>matching</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> coefficients such as drag coefficient or lift coefficient of the prototype and the model. Based on this method, the takeoff distance, landing distance and the rate of climb of the model came out to be 218 ft, 91 ft and 11. 1 fpm respectively. Since the performance data of the actual Cessna 172 is already given, calculating those data from the model was avoided...|$|R
40|$|This axial {{compressor}} design was primarily focused {{to increase the}} power rating of the current Nuovo Pignonc PGTIO Heavy-Duty gas turbine by 10 %. In addition, the new I 1 -slage design favourably compares with the existing 17 -stage compressor in terms of simplicity and coal. By scaling the flowpoth and blade geometry, the new aerodynamic design {{can be applied to}} gas turbines with different power ratings as well. The reduction in the stage number was achieved primarily through the meridional flow-path redesign. The resulting higher blade peripheral speeds achieve larger stage pressure ratios without increasing the aerodynamic loadings. Wide chord blades keep the overall length unchanged thus assuring easy integration with other existing components. The compressor performance map was extensively checked over the speed range required for two-shan gas turbines. The prototype unit was installed on a special PGTIO gas turbine sclup, that permitted the control of pressure ratio independently from the turbine matching requirements. The flowpath instrumentation included strain-gages, dynamic pressure transducers and stator vane leading edge aerodynamic probes to determine individual stage characteristics. The general blading vibratory behavior was proved fully satisfactory. With minor adjustments to the variable stator settings the front stage <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>matching</b> was optimized and the design performance was achieved...|$|E
40|$|Two scaling methodologies are {{presented}} {{to address the}} dissimilitude normally experienced when attempting to measure global aerodynamic loads {{on a small scale}} wind turbine rotor from a full scale reference. The first, termed direct aerofoil replacement (DAR), redesigns the profile of the blade using a multipoint aerofoil optimisation algorithm, which couples a genetic algorithm (GA) and XFOIL, such that the local non-dimensional lift force is similar to the full scale. Correcting for the reduced Reynolds number in this manner allows for the non-dimensional chord and twist distributions to be maintained at small scale increasing the similitude of the unsteady aerodynamic response; an inherent consideration {{in the study of the}} aerodynamic response of floating wind turbine rotors. The second, the geometrically free rotor design (GFRD) methodology, which utilises the Python based multi-objective GA DEAP and blade-element momentum (BEM) code CCBlade, results in a more simplistic but less accurate design. Numerical simulations of two rotors, produced using the defined scaling methodologies, show an excellent level of similarity of the thrust and reasonably good torque matching for the DAR rotor to the full scale reference. The GFRD rotor design is more simplistic, and hence more readily manufacturable, than the DAR, however the <b>aerodynamic</b> performance <b>match</b> to the full scale turbine is relatively poor...|$|R
40|$|A {{miniature}} three-component accelerometer balance {{system for}} measuring the fundamental aerodynamic force coefficients over blunt bodies has been designed, fabricated and tested in the Indian Institute of Science hypersonic shock tunnel HST 2 at a nominal Mach number of 5. 75. The model and the balance system are supported by rubber bushes, thereby ensuring unrestrained free-floating conditions of the model in the test section during the flow duration. Exhaustive axisymmetric finite-element simulations are carried out to select appropriate rubber bushes and materials for the model and the balance system. The internally mountable accelerometer balance is {{used to measure the}} drag, lift and pitching moment coefficients for a 60 ^o apex angle blunt cone within the effective tunnel test time of 800 μs. The measured <b>aerodynamic</b> force coefficients <b>match</b> very well with the theoretical values predicted using modified Newtonian theory at moderate specific enthalpy levels of the test gas...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} evolutionary {{model of the}} Sun's protoplanetary disk. The model predicts from first principles the gas densities and temperatures, and abundances of calcium-rich, aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) and refractory lithophile elements (Ca, Al, Ti, etc.). A central assumption is that Jupiter's core formed early (< 1 Myr) at 3 AU, opening a gap and creating a pressure maximum beyond it in which CAIs were trapped, thereby resolving the "CAI Storage Problem" of meteoritics. Carbonaceous chondrites formed in this pressure trap, while ordinary and enstatite chondrites formed from material inside Jupiter depleted in CAIs by <b>aerodynamic</b> drag. We <b>match</b> the model outputs at different times and locations to each of 11 chondrites, 5 achondrites, and the embryos of Earth and Mars, finding excellent agreement with known meteoritic constraints, and making specific, testable predictions where constraints are lacking. We predict the embryos of the terrestrial planets formed rapidly, in < 2 Myr, and that dynamical scattering of asteroids was limited. We predict CI chondrites are depleted in refractory elements relative to the Sun, by about 9 % (0. 04 dex). The model demands low levels of turbulence (α∼ 10 ^- 4) inside 1 AU, falling to lower levels (∼ 10 ^- 5) beyond 10 AU, suggesting angular momentum transport was dominated by hydrodynamical instabilities augmented by magnetic disk winds, and not by the magnetorotational instability. By 4 Myr, gas had vanished interior to Jupiter, but persisted beyond Jupiter, so that the solar nebula was a transition disk. The model demonstrates the power of meteoritic data to constrain astrophysical disk processes. Comment: 47 pages, 14 figures, 4 tables, submitted to Ap...|$|R
