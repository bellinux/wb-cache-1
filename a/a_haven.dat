5|$|Built {{on a site}} long {{favored by}} pre-Columbian peoples, Lock Haven began in 1833 as a timber town and <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> for loggers, boatmen, and other {{travelers}} on the river or the West Branch Canal. Resource extraction and efficient transportation financed much of the city's growth {{through the end of}} the 19thcentury. In the 20thcentury, a light-aircraft factory, a college, and a paper mill, along with many smaller enterprises, drove the economy. Frequent floods, especially in 1972, damaged local industry and led to a high rate of unemployment in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|California {{was quickly}} granted {{statehood}} in 1850 and the U.S. military built Fort Point at the Golden Gate and a fort on Alcatraz Island {{to secure the}} San Francisco Bay. Silver discoveries, including the Comstock Lode in Nevada in 1859, further drove rapid population growth. With hordes of fortune seekers streaming through the city, lawlessness was common, and the Barbary Coast section of town gained notoriety as <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> for criminals, prostitution, and gambling.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} two questions. First, {{we investigate}} whether gold is a hedge against stocks and/or bonds and second, we investigate whether gold is <b>a</b> safe <b>haven</b> for investors if either stocks or bonds fall. <b>A</b> safe <b>haven</b> {{is defined as}} a security that loses none of its value in case of a market crash. This is counterpoised against a hedge, defined as a security that does not co-move with stocks or bonds on average. We study constant and time-varying relationships between stocks, bonds and gold in order to investigate the existence of a hedge and <b>a</b> safe <b>haven.</b> The empirical analysis examines US, UK and German stock and bond prices and returns and their relationship with the Gold price. We find that (i) Gold is a hedge against stocks, (ii) Gold is <b>a</b> safe <b>haven</b> in extreme stock market conditions and (iii) Gold is <b>a</b> safe <b>haven</b> for stocks only for 15 trading days after an extreme shock occurred.

5|$|Faced {{with the}} {{prospect}} of a takeover by the pro-communists, UMNO changed their minds about the merger. On 27 May, Malaya's Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, mooted the idea of a Federation of Malaysia, comprising existing Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei and the British Borneo territories of North Borneo and Sarawak. The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Borneo territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population. The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> for communism.|$|E
5|$|For much of {{the socialist}} period, the United States was <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> for many Serbian anti-communists living outside Yugoslavia. On 20 June 1979, a Serbian {{nationalist}} named Nikola Kavaja hijacked American Airlines Flight 293 from New York City {{with the intention of}} crashing the Boeing 707 into League of Communists of Yugoslavia headquarters in Belgrade. The aircraft, however, landed in Shannon, Ireland, where Kavaja were arrested.|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{has been}} seen as <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> for {{refugees}} from other African countries, including Mozambique and Rwanda, since 1985. These influxes of refugees have placed a strain on the Malawian economy but have also drawn significant inflows of aid from other countries. Donors to Malawi include the United States, Canada, Germany, Iceland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Ireland, the UK and Flanders (Belgium), as well as international institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European Union, the African Development Bank and UN organisations.|$|E
40|$|Our aim is {{to explain}} how a small country can be viable as an {{international}} banking center (IBC). We build a model in which mobile investors choose between two banking centers located respectively in a small country and in a large country. These countries compete in two instruments, taxation and institutional infrastructure. It follows that an IBC can be <b>a</b> tax <b>haven,</b> <b>a</b> safe <b>haven,</b> or both. <b>A</b> small country that hosts an IBC is <b>a</b> safe <b>haven</b> when {{it is able to}} provide a high level of institutional infrastructure, whereas it chooses to be <b>a</b> tax <b>haven</b> when it cannot be competitive in institutional infrastructure. Even in this last case, an IBC need not be as bad as claimed in the general press because its presence fosters institutional competition across countries, which is ultimately beneficial to all investors. institutional infrastructure competition; international banking centers; portfolio investments; tax competition...|$|R

5|$|O'Leary was {{referring}} to the Lavender Menace, a description by second wave feminist Betty Friedan for attempts by members of the National Organization for Women (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> for lesbians. As part of this process, Rita Mae Brown and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The {{closure of}} the border region for nearly 40years created <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> for {{wildlife}} in some places. Although parts of the East German {{side of the border}} were farmed, intensive farming of the kind practised elsewhere in Germany was absent and large areas were untouched by agriculture. Conservationists became aware as early as the 1970s that the border had become a refuge for rare species of animals and plants. Their findings led the Bavarian government to begin a programme of buying land along the border to ensure its protection from development.|$|E

5|$|There are twenty-four {{counties}} and county-equivalents in the U.S. state of Maryland. Though an independent city {{rather than a}} county, the City of Baltimore is considered the equal of a county for most purposes and is a county-equivalent. Many of the counties in Maryland were named for relatives of the Barons Baltimore who were the proprietors of the Maryland colony from its founding in 1634 through 1771. The Barons Baltimore were Catholic, and George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, originally intended that the colony be <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> for English Catholics, though {{for most of its}} history Maryland has had a majority of Protestants.|$|E
5|$|With no {{government}} enforcement from the Chinese or the British {{aside from a}} few raids by the Hong Kong Police, the Walled City became <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> for crime and drugs. It was only during a 1959 trial for a murder that occurred within the Walled City that the Hong Kong government was ruled to have jurisdiction there. By this time, however, the Walled City was virtually ruled by the organised crime syndicates known as triads.|$|E
5|$|After the Council of Westminster, Hilary {{supported}} the king throughout the Becket dispute, and one {{factor in his}} royalist position may have been that Hilary remembered who had opposed his case against Battle Abbey, and thus refused to support the archbishop. Towards the end of 1163, Henry sent Hilary on an embassy to Becket, to persuade the archbishop to modify his position, but Becket was unmoved. Hilary also {{took part in the}} king's embassy in 1164 to Pope Alexander III and King Louis VII of France, which attempted to persuade the pope and the king of France to favour King Henry instead of Becket, and to keep Becket from finding <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> in France during his exile.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the English Civil War Birmingham's booming economy, its {{expanding}} population, and its resulting high levels of social mobility and cultural pluralism, had seen it develop new social structures very different from those of more established areas. Relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society, and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak. The town's reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in 1643, and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the 1630s and as <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> for Nonconformists from the 1660s.|$|E
5|$|CofresÃ­'s sudden {{success was}} an oddity, {{nearly a century}} {{after the end of}} the Golden Age of Piracy. By this time, joint {{governmental}} efforts had eradicated rampant buccaneering by Anglo-French seamen (primarily based on Jamaica and Tortuga), which had turned the Caribbean into <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> for pirates attacking shipments from the region's Spanish colonies; this made his capture a priority. By late 1823, the pursuit on land probably forced CofresÃ­ to move his main base of operations to Mona; the following year, he was often there. This base, initially a temporary haven with Barrio Pedernales his stable outpost, became more heavily used. Easily accessible from Cabo Rojo, Mona had been associated with pirates for more than a century; it was visited by William Kidd, who landed in 1699 after fleeing with a load of gold, silver and iron. A second pirate base was found at Saona, an island south of Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|Despite segregationist {{and racist}} attitudes, St. Louis acted as <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> during the 1917 East St. Louis Riot, as St. Louis police shepherded fleeing blacks across the Eads Bridge to shelter and food {{provided}} by the city government and the American Red Cross. Leonidas C. Dyer, who represented part of St. Louis in the U.S. House, led a Congressional investigation into the events and eventually sponsored an anti-lynching bill in response. Due to an influx of refugees from East St. Louis and the general effects of the Great Migration of blacks from the rural South to industrial cities, the black population of St. Louis increased more rapidly than the whole during the decade of 1910 to 1920.|$|E
