5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> in spite of great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret {{the lack of any}} intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

25|$|As they approached, Private Nunn threw a punch at Ridgeway, and a melee broke out. Bozman {{drew his}} gun and fired, hitting Adams in the neck. The crowd scattered, and jeeps arrived to rescue the wounded. Four black {{soldiers}} reported that the officers refused {{to take them to}} hospital. As the injured soldiers returned to the base, rumours began to spread that the MPs were out to shoot black soldiers, and panic spread around the base. A few soldiers slipped out, perhaps hoping to find the MPs and get revenge, but the majority stayed on base. The Colonel was absent, and so it fell to Major George C. Heris to calm the situation. Lieutenant Edwin D. Jones, the only black officer in the ranks, was able to persuade the soldiers that Heris would be able to round up the MPs <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> justice was done.|$|E

500|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} Steve Huey {{wrote that}} Dr. Octagonecologyst [...] "...attracted {{more attention than}} any non-mainstream rap album in quite a while, thanks to its inventive production and Keith's bizarre, free-associative rhymes." [...] Huey also states that Dr. Octagonecologyst represented [...] "...the first truly new, genuine alternative to commercial hip-hop since the Native Tongues' heyday. It appealed strongly to alternative audiences who'd grown up with rap music, but simply hadn't related to it since the rise of gangsta". Thornton expressed some frustration with the Dr. Octagon nickname, saying, [...] "I just made a record. I was an artist on a project, and I think people [...] that I was an artist on a project.

500|$|The episode {{introduces}} two new {{characters to}} the series, portrayed by Aaron Munoz (Tony) and Michael Raymond-James (Dave). Although {{they were killed}} off in the episode, writer Robert Kirkman wanted to evoke a reaction that the characters would recur throughout the series. [...] "With the casting of those two guys and everything involving that scene we were really {{trying to convince the}} audience {{that they were going to}} be new regulars, so the end would be that much more shocking." [...] Kirkman felt that Tony and Dave represent new threats and anxieties for the group. [...] "I think this was a particularly good episode coming back because the two guys in the bar represent new threats and they are really just the tip of the iceberg," [...] he stated. [...] "It's really good to come back and be off of the farm <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> there are more dangerous things out there than the zombies. Things just keep getting worse from here.".

In the video, to brothers live separately, {{one of them in}} La Havana, and the other in Miami, Florida. The video ends with the boys encountering each other in a bridge, along many other people. The video shows the problematic about the migration on Cuba. Arjona shot the video while on his Quinto Piso Tour. It was filmed between Mexico and Argentina, with the collaboration of children from 5 to 13 age old. Coambre commented about the video that [...] ""Puente" [...] for me is an array of images that tell the same story in opposite realities. Two boys exactly alike; one lives in an abandoned hotel on the beach and the other lives in a big city skyscraper, yet both are equally lonely. Miami and Havana are where those two boys are in their own worlds <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the only way out of their realms are when they decide to encounter one another." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{contained}} several elaborate stunts {{and effect}} sequences. Gish performed {{all of her}} stunts in the episode, including one shot when she jumped from a thirty-foot descender. She later called the sequence [...] "the biggest stunt of my career." [...] For several of the special effect shots, Manners was forced to compromise on his original decision. One specific shot, wherein Audrey Pauley had to disappear after appearing in front of Gish, was originally {{going to be done}} via CGI. Eventually, Manners decided to [...] "tie the two actresses [...] together [...] and then you [...] to Annabeth and in her face there's an 'oh shit' reaction, and then [...] straight up on a crane, all right, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she's completely alone." [...] He called effects like these [...] "creative ways to trim [...] budget." [...] To create the floating hospital scene, a small door set was merged with a CGI hospital. Initially, the scene used a straight flat [...] "piece of cement" [...] as the bottom of the building. The effects team tried adding a [...] "big piece of earth" [...] under the building, but Paul Rabwin felt it looked too much like The Little Prince, so the piece of earth was removed. The final result also removed the cement-like base.|$|E
500|$|On July 11, 1886, {{a meeting}} {{was held at}} the home of P.N. Clausen at which the Danebod {{congregation}} was formally organized with fifteen members. The church council consisted of its president, P.N. Clausen, secretary M.Lauritsen, and treasurer Jørgen Jacobsen. At first there were no regular church services and no resident pastor. Instead, the people met in various homes to sing Danish hymns and listen to a reading of the sermon by a layman. The pastor of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, S.C. Madsen, and other ministers occasionally conducted services in town. The congregation later hired the Danish settler, pastor Hans Jørgen Pedersen (1851–1905) of Gowen, Michigan. He arrived with his family on April12, 1888. Pedersen had a humble upbringing in Denmark, where he later studied at Ryslinge Folk High School before emigrating to America in 1875. He was an eloquent preacher, resourceful, and became involved in community activities throughout the area. He quickly assumed leadership and thus, in a sense, became the founder of Danebod. One of the pastor's six children, Sigurd Pedersen, described their first arrival in Danebod in his autobiography: [...] "It was a chilly morning, when the committee stood on the platform to bid welcome to the new pastor and his wife, trailed by six children, and the rear held up by the trusty hired man, Søren Olsen, who was to keep count of the straying flock <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the last luggage was not forgotten. Friends invited us over for breakfast in the home of H.J. Nelsen, the merchant. Then the committee guided us to a small house on the corner just west of the present-day Chevrolet dealer, where businessman Carl Cold Sorensen brought the first automobiles to the area in the early 1900's. The committee had left no kindling in this small house, but Søren Olsen soon discovered that the kitchen range was in place and claimed to be able to manipulate the same if kindling could be provided. Across the street was a large general store, and father sent us there to beg Mr.Lauritsen for some kindling. We were given old boxes to break up, and we soon had our arms full and Søren had a blazing fire in a few minutes." [...] In September 1888, it was decided at a convention in Elk Horn, Iowa, to give the congregation at Danebod [...] of land, and the Danebod Lutheran Church was dedicated on Sunday, June16, 1895. Pedersen died in 1905, and the Reverend Thorvald Knudsen succeeded him at Danebod.|$|E
