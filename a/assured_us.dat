Just then the car swung over the summit of a raise, and we saw the white tents and grazing camels of an enormous caravan. Of course, Mongols would have mutton fat and why not use that for oil! The caravan leader <b>assured</b> <b>us</b> that he had fat in plenty and in ten minutes a great pot of it was warming over the fire. We poured it into the motor and proceeded merrily on our way.|$|E

The location was chosen in homage to President Ronald Reagan, who launched his own presidential campaign {{from the same}} location. Referring to Reagan's announcement, Huntsman remarked in his own speech, [...] "He <b>assured</b> <b>us</b> we could 'make America great again,' and under his leadership we did. I stand in his shadow {{as well as the}} shadow of this magnificent monument to our liberty." ...|$|E
500|$|However, the British Government {{was able}} to {{continue}} denying any knowledge of mercenary activity. On 21 July 1964, Douglas-Home replied to a parliamentary question by saying [...] "Both the present High Commissioner and his predecessor have <b>assured</b> <b>us</b> {{that they were not}} aware that the person in question (Tony Boyle) was involved in any way". The following day (22 July 1964), Douglas-Home sent a memorandum to the Foreign Secretary Rab Butler, in which he [...] "decreed that the United Kingdom should 'make life intolerable' for Nasser, 'with money and arms', and that this 'should be deniable if possible'." [...] The result was that a secret Joint Action Committee was created to handle British policy on Yemen. The British support continued until 1965, when the Kingdom decided to abandon its Aden Colony.|$|E

2500|$|In Australia, {{the effects}} of the war on the economy were no less severe. The Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes, wrote to the British prime minister, Lloyd George, [...] "You have <b>assured</b> <b>us</b> that you cannot get better terms. I much regret it, and hope even now that some way may be found of {{securing}} agreement for demanding reparation commensurate with the tremendous sacrifices made by the British Empire and her Allies." [...] Australia received ₤5,571,720 war reparations, but the direct cost of the war to Australia had been ₤376,993,052, and, by the mid-1930s, repatriation pensions, war gratuities, interest and sinking fund charges were ₤831,280,947. Of about 416,000 Australians who served, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were wounded.|$|E

The band claimed the samples [...] "were provided {{by a member of}} the album's production team who has <b>assured</b> <b>us</b> that these few seconds of sound were obtained legitimately." [...] Chinese Democracy was banned in the People's Republic of China, due to perceived criticism in its title track of the Government of the People's Republic of China and reference to the Falun Gong. The Chinese government said through the media that it [...] "turns its spear point on China".|$|E
2500|$|As rumors continued, {{they were}} tracked and checked by the {{investigating}} officers {{to make sure}} that a clue was not being overlooked. Stories ranged from the killer turning himself in, to a third and even fourth double murder. Gonzaullas stated that Texarkanians were trying hard to help in the cases, but many were hindering it maliciously, using the cases as an instrument for grudges and spitefulness. On Thursday, Gonzaullas and Presley issued a statement that if a break came in the cases, it would be reported in the Gazette and Daily News. Gonzaullas continued, [...] "The newspapers are not printing rumors and have <b>assured</b> <b>us</b> they will not.

2500|$|Searches for Noah's Ark have {{traditionally}} concentrated on Mount Ararat. Augustin Calmet {{wrote in his}} 1722 biblical dictionary, [...] "It is affirmed, but without proof, {{that there are still}} remains of Noah's ark on the top of this mountain; but M. de Tournefort, who visited this spot, has <b>assured</b> <b>us</b> there was nothing like it; that the top of mount Ararat is inaccessible, both by reason of its great height, and of the snow which perpetually covers it." [...] Archaeological expeditions, sometimes supported by evangelical and millenarian churches, have been conducted since the 19th century in search of the ark. According to a 1974 book around 200 people from more than 20 countries claimed to have seen the Ark on Ararat since 1856. A fragment from the ark supposedly found on Ararat is on display at the museum of Etchmiadzin Cathedral, the center of the Armenian Church. Despite numerous reports of ark sightings (e.g. Ararat anomaly) and rumors, [...] "no scientific evidence of the ark has emerged." ...|$|E

The suit alleges that the portions used were from Schnauss' 2001 Wherever You Are and 2003 A Strangely Isolated Place. Brian Caplan, attorney for Domino, stated that they first contacted the Geffen label on February 26. The label [...] "attempted to explain [...] away", Caplan told the New York Daily News [...] "They tried to justify it." [...] Guns N' Roses vigorously denied the allegations. Guns N' Roses manager Irving Azoff stated that [...] "The snippets of 'ambient noise' in question were provided {{by a member of}} the album's production team who has <b>assured</b> <b>us</b> that these few seconds of sound were obtained legitimately." [...] Going further, he added [...] "While the band resents the implication that they would ever use another artist's work improperly and are assessing possible counterclaims, they are confident this situation will be satisfactorily resolved." [...] The two labels are seeking $1 million in damages against Geffen for the unauthorized use of the composition samples.|$|E

6000|$|However, lest {{we imagine}} our author's success was {{constant}} and universal, they acquaint us of certain {{works in a}} less degree of repute, whereof, although owned by others, yet do they <b>assure</b> <b>us</b> he is the writer. Of this sort Mr Dennis[185] ascribes to him two farces, whose names he does not tell, but <b>assures</b> <b>us</b> {{that there is not}} one jest in them; and an imitation of Horace, whose title he does not mention, but <b>assures</b> <b>us</b> it is much more execrable than all his works.[186] The Daily Journal, May 11, 1728, <b>assures</b> <b>us</b> 'He is below Tom D'Urfey in the drama, because (as that writer thinks) the Marriage-Hater Matched, and the Boarding School, are better than the What-d'-ye-call-it,' which is not Mr P.'s, but Mr Gay's. Mr Gildon <b>assures</b> <b>us,</b> in his New Rehearsal, p. 48, 'That he was writing a play of the Lady Jane Grey;' but it afterwards proved to be Mr Howe's. We are assured by another, 'He wrote a pamphlet called Dr Andrew Tripe,'[187] which proved to be one Dr Wagstaff's. Mr Theobald <b>assures</b> <b>us</b> in Mist of the 27th April, 'That the Treatise of the Pro-found is very dull, and that Mr Pope is the author of it.' The writer of Gulliveriana is of another opinion, and says, 'The whole, or greatest part, of the merit of this treatise must and can only be ascribed to Gulliver.'[188] (Here, gentle reader! cannot I but smile at the strange blindness and positiveness of men, knowing the said treatise to appertain to none other but to me, Martinus Scriblerus.) We are assured, in Mist of June 8, 'That his own plays and farces would better have adorned the Dunciad than those of Mr Theobald, for he had neither genius for tragedy nor comedy;' which, whether true or not, is not easy to judge, inasmuch as he hath attempted neither--unless we will take it for granted, with Mr Cibber, that his being once very angry at hearing a friend's play abused was an infallible proof the play was his own, the said Mr Cibber thinking it impossible for a man to be much concerned for any but himself: 'Now let any man judge,' saith he, 'by this concern, who was the true mother of the child?'[189] ...|$|R
