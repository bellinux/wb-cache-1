5|$|From an {{ecological}} perspective, raptor populations {{in urban areas}} <b>are</b> <b>highly</b> beneficial. Compared with Europe where pigeon populations have exploded to the point they are both a tourist attraction and a public nuisance. Their faeces <b>are</b> <b>highly</b> acidic causing damage to historic buildings and statues made of soft stone. They nest in bridges where it compiles and damages iron work causing rust and corrosion. In the United States, falcon and other raptors are in numbers high enough to ward off pigeon nest building in major highrises.|$|E

30|$|When {{looking at}} the {{education}} level, we observe a curvilinear relationship with age at migration and education level. The higher the age at migration, the higher the probability that an immigrant <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> educated. It <b>is</b> the opposite result in terms of middle and low education. Female and married immigrants {{are more likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> educated. However, immigrants with children were less likely to <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> educated. In line with expectations, an immigrant is much more likely to <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> educated if the human capital for the region of origin is higher.|$|R
5|$|Hawksbills <b>are</b> <b>highly</b> {{resilient}} and {{resistant to}} their prey. Some of the sponges they eat, such as Aaptos aaptos, Chondrilla nucula, Tethya actinia, Spheciospongia vesparium, and Suberites domuncula, <b>are</b> <b>highly</b> (often lethally) toxic to other organisms.

5|$|New styles {{such as the}} Maguindanao’s kagungudan and the Maranao’s bago, are {{considered}} fast, rhythmic and showy. Generally genres under this classification have faster tempos {{with an emphasis on}} power and speed, <b>are</b> <b>highly</b> rhythmic and pulsating, and <b>are</b> <b>highly</b> improvised with musicians employing different rhythmic/melodic formulae not used with old patterns. “Young” musicians, specifically young men, gravitate toward this style because of its emphasis on virtuosity and one’s individualism. Generally played after all kamamatuan pieces have been played to give younger musicians the opportunity to participate.|$|E
