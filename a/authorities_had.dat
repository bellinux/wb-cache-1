5|$|The Minister for Environment, Faisal Saleh Hayat, {{stated that}} he had {{requested}} security for the building, but <b>authorities</b> <b>had</b> failed to provide it. Contrary to claims made earlier, Hayat said the ministry was never ordered to vacate the premises before Pakistan Rangers deployed.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} {{alleged that}} the U.S. military repeatedly conducted indiscriminate attacks, failing to distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. In its most significant finding, the commission also confirmed that South Korean <b>authorities</b> <b>had</b> summarily executed thousands of suspected leftists in South Korea – possibly 100,000 to 200,000 – at {{the outbreak of the}} war, sometimes with U.S. Army officers present and taking photographs.|$|E

50|$|The {{protocol}} implicitly prevents {{corruption of}} ballots.This {{is because the}} <b>authorities</b> <b>have</b> no incentive to change the ballot since each <b>authority</b> <b>has</b> only {{a share of the}} ballot and has no knowledge how changing this share will affect the outcome.|$|R

5|$|A lack of {{preparation}} for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built on an alluvial fan that had been overrun by historic mudflows; <b>authorities</b> <b>had</b> ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars. Residents stayed inside their dwellings to avoid the falling ash, as local officials had instructed them to do, not thinking {{that they might be}} buried by the mudflows.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qaeda {{had begun}} reconnoitering Nairobi for {{potential}} targets in December 1993, using {{a team led}} by Ali Mohamed. In January 1994, bin Laden was personally presented with the team's surveillance reports, and he and his senior advisers began to develop a plan to attack the American embassy there. From February to June 1998, al-Qaeda prepared to launch their attacks, renting residences, building their bombs, and acquiring trucks; meanwhile, bin Laden continued his public-relations efforts, giving interviews with ABC News and Pakistani journalists. While U.S. <b>authorities</b> <b>had</b> investigated al-Qaeda activities in Nairobi, they had not detected any warnings of imminent attacks.|$|E
5|$|Although the British <b>authorities</b> <b>had</b> {{prohibited}} the American Neo-Nazi George Lincoln Rockwell {{from entering the}} UK, the NSM managed to smuggle him in via Ireland to attend a summer camp in August 1962. There, the NSM {{took part in the}} formation of the World Union of National Socialists (WUNS), at which Jordan was elected 'world führer' and Rockwell as his heir. Among those in attendance were the Neo-Nazi Savitri Devi and the former SS officer Fred Borth.|$|E

5|$|Another seven internees were {{executed}} by the Japanese authorities. These internees had possessed a radio set which they used to pass messages {{in and out of}} camp. The radio was discovered by the Japanese and the internees were arrested. The other internees were forced to watch their public torture. Military trials were subsequently held and on 29 October 1943, some of the internees {{were executed}} by being shot and at least one, John Fraser, was beheaded. Aside from this, the Japanese <b>authorities</b> <b>had</b> executed by decapitation, three Chinese policemen for bringing cigarettes and tobacco to the camp's internees.|$|E
5|$|As Buchenwald was {{a forced}} labor camp, the German <b>authorities</b> <b>had</b> {{intended}} {{to put the}} 168 airmen to work as slave-labor in the nearby armament factories. Consequently, Lamason was ordered by an SS officer to instruct the airmen to work, or he would be immediately executed by firing squad. Lamason refused to give the order and informed the officer that they were soldiers and could not and would not participate in war production. After a tense stand-off, during which time Lamason {{thought he would be}} shot, the SS officer eventually backed down.|$|E
5|$|Bristol sent three {{ships to}} the Royal Navy fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and also {{supplied}} two levies {{of men to}} the defending land forces. Despite appeals to the Privy Council no reimbursement was made for these supplies. The corporation also had to repair the walls and gates of the city. The castle had fallen into disuse in the late Tudor era, but the City <b>authorities</b> <b>had</b> no control over royal property and the precincts became a refuge for lawbreakers.|$|E

He {{commanded}} Army Group South in the Flămânda operation against the Third Bulgarian Army and other forces of the Central Powers, ultimately stopped by the German offensive (Averescu's forces did not register important losses, and orderly retreated to Moldavia, where Romanian <b>authorities</b> <b>had</b> taken refuge from the successful German operations).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the launch}} ceremony, the {{builders}} {{had planned to}} have Great Britain towed to the Thames for her final fitting out. Unfortunately, the harbour <b>authorities</b> <b>had</b> failed {{to carry out the}} necessary modifications to their facilities in a timely manner. Exacerbating the problem, the ship had been widened beyond the original plans to accommodate the propeller engines, and her designers had made a belated decision to fit the engines prior to launch, which resulted in a deeper draught.|$|E
5|$|Georgian forces {{started moving}} towards Tskhinvali {{following}} {{several hours of}} bombardment and engaged South Ossetian forces and militia near the town at 04:00 on 8 August, with Georgian tanks remotely shelling South Ossetian positions. An attempt to take the village of Kvaysa from the west of South Ossetia by the Georgian special forces was thwarted by a platoon of South Ossetian troops occupying fortified positions; several Georgian soldiers were wounded. By the morning, the South Ossetian <b>authorities</b> <b>had</b> reported that the Georgian shelling had killed at least 15 civilians.|$|E

A group from the Aruban police and prosecutor's office then traveled to the FBI central laboratory at Quantico, Virginia, to consult with American investigators. The hair samples were then tested a second time. The FBI {{announced that}} the hair samples {{did not belong to}} Holloway.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{held that}} the plaintiffs lacked locus standi to bring the action as {{they were not the}} temple's legal owners. In any case, as there was {{evidence}} that the <b>authorities</b> <b>had</b> rational reasons for treating the temple property differently from the property of the Mission and the Church, the High Court found that there had been no breach of Article 12(1). Furthermore, the Court determined that the plaintiffs were guilty of inordinate delay in bringing the action.|$|E
5|$|The <b>authorities</b> <b>had</b> {{initially}} {{planned for}} the replica to replace the red Berlayer Beacon, but the Singapore Heritage Society was against the decision, saying the beacon was itself a heritage site {{and should not be}} destroyed because the beacon has been at Labrador Park since the end of World War II. The replica was finally built just meters away from the beacon. The authorities hope the symbolic replica can serve to preserve the memory of Long Ya Men, which {{is an important part of}} Singapore's maritime history, for future generations and visitors familiar with the historical voyages of Zheng He.|$|E

5|$|The {{immediate}} cause for {{a confrontation with}} the JNA in Split was a blockade of the village of Kijevo, where Croatian <b>authorities</b> <b>had</b> established a new police station, imposed on 29 April. The village was surrounded by the JNA, commanded by Colonel Ratko Mladić, and the Serb insurgent forces, cutting access and preventing delivery of supplies. Tuđman called on the public to bring the siege to its end.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} 18 N-3PBs {{were used}} to equip No. 330 (Norwegian) Squadron RAF in Reykjavík, Iceland. The N-3PBs sent to Iceland were all shipped across the Atlantic in crates on board the Norwegian steamer , the voyage from New York to Reykjavik taking 13 days to complete. Part {{of the reason for}} deploying the N-3PBs to Iceland were to avoid having the unusual aircraft operating over the United Kingdom, with the involved risk of friendly fire incidents. The exiled Norwegian military <b>authorities</b> <b>had</b> originally wanted to base the squadron in the United Kingdom {{in order to be able}} to operate off German-occupied Norway.|$|E
5|$|Under US and UN pressure, Pakistan {{arrested a}} few members of Jamaat ud-Dawa and briefly put its founder under house arrest, but he was found to be free a few days later.

Meanwhile, journalists in Pakistan said security agencies were preventing them from interviewing people from Kasab's village. Home Minister P.
