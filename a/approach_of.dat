5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the sky {{is one of the more}} important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> a line of thunderstorms could indicate the <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E

These studies include investigation into binocular rivalry, interocular information transfer, three-dimensional depth perception as well as impairments of the visual system like amblyopia and stereodeficiency. In this paper, we review various <b>approaches</b> <b>of</b> displaying dichoptic stimulus used in {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} experiments. These include traditional <b>approaches</b> <b>of</b> using filters (red-green, red-blue, polarizing) with optical assemblies as well as newer <b>approaches</b> <b>of</b> using bi-screen goggles...|$|R

5|$|After Lieder, {{the first}} person to {{propagate}} her Planet X idea was Mark Hazlewood, {{a former member of the}} ZetaTalk community, who in 2001 published a book titled Blindsided: Planet X Passes in 2003. Lieder would later accuse him of being a confidence trickster. A Japanese cult called the Pana Wave Laboratory, which blocked off roads and rivers with white cloths to protect itself from electromagnetic attacks, also warned that the world would end in May 2003 after the <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> a tenth planet.|$|E
5|$|Although {{presented}} in two-dimensional side-scrolling format, the game retains the action-oriented <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> its predecessors, with the player controlling the character Kratos {{in the same}} combination of combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements. Platforming elements include jumping across chasms, climbing ladders, and swinging on ropes. Some puzzles require Kratos to move a box {{on top of a}} switch (thus activating it), or moving a box {{to use it as a}} jumping-off point to reach a pathway unreachable with normal jumping. Game length is approximately two to four hours, and it consists of ten levels.|$|E

The heavily damaged Amatsukaze escaped under cover of a smoke screen while Helena was distracted by an attack by Asagumo, Murasame, and Samidare.|$|E

5|$|Based at RAF Abbotsinch near Paisley, the {{squadron}} operated the Hawker Hind light bomber. The members of squadron—both pilots and ground staff—were reservists and completed their service on a part-time basis, in the evenings, weekends {{and an annual}} two–week summer camp. With the <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> war, {{the squadron}} converted to a fighter role and re-equipped with the Supermarine Spitfire. It mobilised on the outbreak of war at RAF Grangemouth on 6 October 1939 and then to RAF Drem a month later, charged with defending Edinburgh and the shipping area around the Firth of Forth.|$|E
5|$|By July 1918, it {{was clear}} that the German Spring Offensive on the Western Front, which had forced the {{postponement}} of offensive plans in Palestine, had failed, resulting in a return to trench warfare on the Western Front.

5|$|Closely {{related to}} power metal is {{progressive}} metal, which adopts the complex compositional <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> bands like Rush and King Crimson. This style {{emerged in the}} United States in the early and mid-1980s, with innovators such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, and Dream Theater. The mix of the progressive and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey's Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo {{is among the most}} recognized of latter-day shredders.|$|E
5|$|Emerging in {{the mid-1980s}} with such bands as California's Saint Vitus, Maryland's The Obsessed, Chicago's Trouble, and Sweden's Candlemass, the doom metal {{movement}} rejected other metal styles' emphasis on speed, slowing its music to a crawl. Doom metal traces its roots to the lyrical themes and musical <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> early Black Sabbath. The Melvins have also been a significant influence on doom metal {{and a number of}} its subgenres. Doom emphasizes melody, melancholy tempos, and a sepulchral mood relative to many other varieties of metal.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{jurisprudence}} signifies {{a reaction}} to the philosophical <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> modern legal scholars, who typically see law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals.

5|$|For {{ten hours}} in December 1982, the Washington Monument and eight {{tourists}} were {{held hostage by}} a nuclear arms protester, Norman Mayer, claiming to have explosives in a van he drove to the monument's base.

5|$|Hearing of the <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> Pompey, Spartacus {{attempted}} {{to negotiate with}} Crassus to bring the conflict to a close before Roman reinforcements arrived.

The legions managed to catch {{a portion of the}} rebels – under the command of Gannicus and Castus – separated from the main army, killing 12,300.|$|E

5|$|Her {{approach}} to religious piety {{differed from the}} <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> her predecessors, as she was influenced by Jansenist ideas.

5|$|In 1880, Selfe became vice {{president}} of the School of Arts. He supported the school's Working Men's College, but felt a more thorough focus on practical skills was needed. He rejected the non-technical, non-practical <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> the school's model and campaigned instead {{for the establishment of a}} proper institute of technical education, where instructors would be skilled tradesmen with practical industrial experience. He also pushed for the expansion of technical education facilities into the suburban and regional districts.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, Asaph Hall adopted this <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> {{modifying the}} {{exponent}} in the inverse-square law slightly to explain an anomalous orbital precession {{of the planet}} Mercury, which had been observed in 1859 by Urbain Le Verrier. Ironically, Hall's theory was ruled out by careful astronomical observations of the Moon. The currently accepted explanation for this precession involves the theory of general relativity, which (to first approximation) adds an inverse-quartic force, i.e., one that varies as the inverse fourth power of distance.|$|E
