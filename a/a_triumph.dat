5|$|The 1st United States Congress, which met in New York City's Federal Hall, was <b>a</b> <b>triumph</b> for the Federalists. The Senate {{of eleven}} states {{contained}} 20 Federalists {{with only two}} Anti-Federalists, both from Virginia. The House included 48 Federalists to 11 Anti-Federalists, the latter of whom were from only four states: Massachusetts, New York, Virginia and South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|These defeats {{forced the}} Galatians {{to sue for}} peace and the Romans {{returned}} to the coast of Asia Minor. However, when Manlius Vulso returned to Rome, {{he was charged with}} threatening the peace between the Seleucids and Rome. He was cleared and was granted <b>a</b> <b>triumph</b> by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Vulso {{began his}} return journey to Rome in 188 BC and arrived in 187 BC. When he {{returned}} to Rome, he received much criticism because of his unauthorised war against the Galatians. However, he eventually overcame the arguments and was awarded <b>a</b> <b>triumph</b> by the senate.|$|E

5|$|After being {{recalled}} from Germania, Germanicus celebrated <b>a</b> <b>triumph</b> in Rome in AD17, {{the first}} full triumph that the city had seen since Augustus's own in 29BC. As a result, in AD18 Germanicus was granted control over {{the eastern part of}} the empire, just as both Agrippa and Tiberius had received before, and was clearly the successor to Tiberius. Germanicus survived a little over a year before dying, accusing Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, the governor of Syria, of poisoning him.|$|E
5|$|Although it was {{cut short}} by Roosevelt's desire to have him testify before Congress on Lend-Lease, Willkie's visit to Britain was deemed <b>a</b> <b>triumph.</b> Willkie also went to Ireland, hoping to persuade Éamon de Valera to abandon neutrality, but his urging was unavailing. Willkie left London for Washington on February 5; {{because of the risk}} of being shot down by Nazi aircraft, the {{roundabout}} journey home took four days. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 11, and his support was key to passing Lend-Lease.|$|E
5|$|Back at Rome, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood of {{the cult}} of Augustus which Germanicus became a member of. When news arrived of his raid, Tiberius commemorated his {{services}} in the Senate with elaborate, but insincere praise: the proceedings gave him joy that the mutiny had been suppressed, but anxiety at the glory and popularity afforded to Germanicus. The Senate, in absence of Germanicus, voted {{that he should be}} given <b>a</b> <b>triumph.</b> Ovid's Fasti dates the Senate vote of Germanicus' triumph to 1 January AD 15.|$|E

5|$|Belisarius {{returned}} to Constantinople with the Vandals' royal treasure and the captive Gelimer to enjoy <b>a</b> <b>triumph,</b> while Africa was formally restored to imperial rule as the praetorian prefecture of Africa. Imperial control scarcely reached beyond the old Vandal kingdom, however, and the Moorish tribes {{of the interior}} proved unwilling to accept imperial rule and soon rose up in rebellion. The new province was shaken by the wars with the Moors and military rebellions, {{and it was not}} until 548 that peace was restored and Roman government firmly established.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus' {{successes in}} Germany {{had made him}} popular with the soldiers. He had dealt a {{significant}} blow to Rome's enemies, quelled an uprising of troops, and returned lost standards to Rome. His actions had increased his fame, and he had become very popular with the Roman people. Tiberius took notice, and had Germanicus recalled to Rome and informed {{him that he would}} be given <b>a</b> <b>triumph</b> and reassigned to a different command.|$|E
5|$|His {{military}} ability {{was tested}} by an {{attack from the}} Sabines. Tarquinius doubled the numbers of equites to help the war effort, and defeat the Sabines. In the peace negotiations that followed, Tarquinius received the town of Collatia and appointed his nephew, Arruns Tarquinius, also known as Egerius, as commander of the garrison which he stationed in that city. Tarquinius returned to Rome and celebrated <b>a</b> <b>triumph</b> for his victories that, according to the Fasti Triumphales, occurred on 13 September 585 BC.|$|E

Setting out from Constantinople, the imperial army followed the Thracian coast into Macedonia, and then south into Thessaly, Central Greece and the Peloponnese. This expedition restored {{a measure of}} Byzantine imperial authority over these areas, and collected booty and tribute from the locals. Empress Irene rewarded her loyal minister by allowing him to celebrate <b>a</b> <b>triumph</b> in the Hippodrome of Constantinople in January 784.|$|E
5|$|In various {{sections}} of the game, the player can ride <b>a</b> <b>Triumph</b> motorcycle, or a snowmobile. Other segments of the game involve boss fights. If the player chooses to be sneaky, they can overhear humorous conversations between non-player characters, such as guards, scientists and civilians. Occasionally, the player can engage in conversations with such characters. In certain cutscenes, the game uses a dialog tree, in which the player can choose between different questions and responses when talking to another character.|$|E
5|$|Leo Phokas {{released}} the Byzantine prisoners after {{providing them with}} provisions, and took the booty and Arab prisoners back to Constantinople, where he celebrated <b>a</b> <b>triumph</b> at the Hippodrome. Indeed, the battle of Andrassos made a deep impression among contemporaries, provoking outbursts of celebration in the Empire, and grief and lamentation in the Syrian cities; it is mentioned by all historical sources of the time, and upheld in the contemporary Byzantine treatise De velitatione bellica {{as one of the}} chief examples of a successful ambush.|$|E

He was accompanied by Germanicus among his other generals, for whom he had obtained the triumphal regalia, and Germanicus took a distinguished part in the celebration. He was given the opportunity to display his consular insignia and his triumphal ornaments whereas his brother Drusus received no special honors except being the son of a triumphator.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} piece of advice Yamamoto gave Kurosawa was that a good director needed to master screenwriting. Kurosawa soon realized that the potential earnings from his scripts were much higher than what he was paid as an assistant director. Kurosawa would later write or co-write all of his own films. He also frequently wrote screenplays for other directors such as for the antiwar film director Satsuo Yamamoto's film, <b>A</b> <b>Triumph</b> of Wings (Tsubasa no gaika, 1942). This outside scriptwriting would serve Kurosawa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into the 1960s, long after he became world-famous.|$|E

During the crucial 1948 {{elections}} that would decide on Italy’s post-war future, Vizzini and Genco Russo sat {{at the same table}} with leading DC politicians, attending an electoral lunch. In the course of the start of the Cold War, the 1948 elections were <b>a</b> <b>triumph</b> for the Christian Democrats, who would govern Italy with up and downs for the next 45 years in different coalitions. One of its main aims was to keep the Italian Communist Party – the biggest communist party in a NATO member state – away from power.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Augustus, Germanicus enjoyed an {{accelerated}} political career as the heir of the emperor's heir, entering the office of quaestor five years before the legal age in AD 7. He held that office until AD 11, and was elected consul {{for the first time}} in AD 12. The year after, he was made proconsul of Germania Inferior, Germania Superior, and all of Gaul. From there he commanded eight legions, about one-third of the entire Roman army, which he led against the Germanic tribes in his campaigns from AD 14 to 16. He avenged the Roman Empire's defeat in the Teutoberg Forest and retrieved two of the three legionary eagles that had been lost during the battle. In AD 17 he returned to Rome where he received <b>a</b> <b>triumph</b> before leaving to reorganize the provinces of Asia Minor, whereby he incorporated the provinces of Cappadocia and Commagene in AD 18.|$|E
5|$|For his services, Ferdinand awarded Monte Sant'Angelo to Skanderbeg {{where many}} of his men soon settled. They settled fifteen villages in the rolling landscapes {{to the east of}} Taranto. His return to Albania was greeted as <b>a</b> <b>triumph</b> by his followers. Despite the jubilation, however, Skanderbeg began to prepare for war. On 7 July 1462, the Turkish army resumed its campaigns in Albania. The first major {{engagement}} was at Mokra on 7 July 1462. In the following Macedonian campaign in August of the same year, Skanderbeg defeated three Ottoman armies in one month. On 27 April 1463, Skanderbeg and Mehmed signed a new peace treaty, but later, on 9 September 1463, Skanderbeg signed an alliance with Venice which had been preparing for war against the Ottomans. On 12 October 1463, Pius grew confident enough to declare his crusade against the Ottoman Turks which Skanderbeg joined.|$|E
5|$|Grant won the {{election}} by 300,000 votes out of 5,716,082 votes cast, receiving an electoral college landslide, of 214 votes to Seymour's 80. Grant, {{at the age of}} 46 became the youngest president on record. His election was <b>a</b> <b>triumph</b> of principles that included sound money, efficient government, and the restoration of Southern reconstructed states. Grant was the first president to be elected after the nation had outlawed slavery and granted citizenship to former slaves. Implementation of these new rights was slow to come; in the 1868 election, the black vote counted in only 16 of the 37 states, nearly all in the South. Grant lost Louisiana and Georgia primarily due to Ku Klux Klan violence against African American voters.|$|E
