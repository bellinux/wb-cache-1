5|$|Hartebeest are {{primarily}} grazers, and their diets consist mostly of grasses. A {{study in the}} Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso found that the hartebeest's skull structure eased the acquisition <b>and</b> <b>chewing</b> of highly fibrous foods. The hartebeest has much lower food intake than {{the other members of}} Alcelaphini. The long thin muzzle of the hartebeest assists in feeding on leaf blades of short grasses and nibbling off leaf sheaths from grass stems. In addition to this, it can derive nutritious food even from tall senile grasses. These adaptations of the hartebeest enable the animal to feed well even in the dry season, which is usually a difficult period for grazers. For instance, in comparison with the roan antelope, the hartebeest is better at procuring <b>and</b> <b>chewing</b> the scarce regrowth of perennial grasses at times when forage is least available. These unique abilities could have allowed the hartebeest to prevail over other animals millions of years ago, leading to its successful radiation in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Early {{members of}} the ceratopsian group, such as Psittacosaurus, were small bipedal animals. Later members, {{including}} ceratopsids like Centrosaurus and Triceratops, became very large quadrupeds and developed elaborate facial horns and frills extending over the neck. While these frills might have served to protect the vulnerable neck from predators, they {{may also have been}} used for display, thermoregulation, the attachment of large neck <b>and</b> <b>chewing</b> muscles or some combination of the above. Ceratopsians ranged in size from 1meter (3ft) and 23kilograms (50lb) to over 9meters (30ft) and 9,100kg (20,100lb).|$|E
5|$|City of Honolulu {{also carried}} notable {{visitors}} to the mainland. Farris M. Brown, a dealer in Stradivarius instruments, arrived in Los Angeles in May 1928 with three of the famous maker's violins, including the Baron Knoop Stradivarius. In April 1929, Swedish swimmer Arne Borg, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Los Angeles on a world swimming tour, and in May, Sir James Gunnson, a former Mayor of Auckland, arrived for a one-month visit to promote increased trade between California and New Zealand. The next January, Herbert Hagerman, former Governor of New Mexico Territory; author Basil Woon, who had been doing research for a Hawaiian story; and aviation promoter <b>and</b> <b>chewing</b> gum magnate William Easterwood all sailed stateside on the ship.|$|E

5000|$|The {{preliminary}} suit {{went after}} Clark's executors, Relf <b>and</b> <b>Chew,</b> {{accusing them of}} fraudulent mismanagement of Clarks's estate assets. The specific claims alleged Relf <b>and</b> <b>Chew</b> had acted fraudulently by pretending that Clark endorsed to them a loan made to Davis. Another claim also accused Relf <b>and</b> <b>Chew</b> of destroying the 1813 will that left most of Clark's fortune to Gaines. [...] In response, the executors denied the allegations and further argued that Clark had never been married to Carrière, had no legitimate descendants, and left his estate to his mother. Additionally, they presented evidence that Mary Clark granted power of attorney to Relf <b>and</b> <b>Chew</b> to act on her behalf in all matters that related to Clark's estate. [...] Finally, they explained that managing Clark's estate was complicated {{as a result of}} defective land titles.|$|R
5|$|Persons with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have no detectable systemic {{symptoms or}} signs (i.e., outside the mouth). Generally, symptoms may include prodromal sensations such as burning, itching, or stinging, which may precede {{the appearance of}} any lesion by some hours; and pain, which is often {{out of proportion to}} the extent of the ulceration and is worsened by physical contact, especially with certain foods and drinks (e.g., if they are acidic). Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer, and then recedes as healing progresses. If there are lesions on the tongue, speaking <b>and</b> <b>chewing</b> can be uncomfortable, and ulcers on the soft palate, back of the throat, or esophagus can cause painful swallowing. Signs are limited to the lesions themselves.|$|E
5|$|Lice {{are divided}} into two groups: sucking lice, which obtain their {{nourishment}} from feeding on the sebaceous secretions and body fluids of their host; <b>and</b> <b>chewing</b> lice, which are scavengers, feeding on skin, fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host's body. Most are found on only specific types of animals, and, in some cases, on only a particular part of the body; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and two to six for birds. For example, in humans, different species of louse inhabit the scalp and pubic hair. Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host. Some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will die. If their host dies, lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt {{to find a new}} host.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of damage}} to the {{hypoglossal}} nerve are rare. The most common causes of injury in one case series were compression by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of the nerve. These include surgical damage, medullary stroke, multiple slcerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, sarcoidosis, and presence of an ectatic vessel in the hypoglossal canal. Damage can be on one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because of the close proximity of the nerve to other structures including nerves, arteries, and veins, it is rare for the nerve to be damaged in isolation. For example, damage {{to the left and}} right hypoglossal nerves may occur with damage to the facial and trigeminal nerves as a result of damage from a clot following arteriosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar artery. Such a stroke may result in tight oral musculature, and difficulty speaking, eating <b>and</b> <b>chewing.</b>|$|E

40|$|We have {{characterized}} mutants {{in a novel}} gene of Bacillus subtilis, cheV, which encodes {{a protein}} homologous to both <b>CheW</b> <b>and</b> CheY. A null mutant in cheV is only slightly defective in capillary and tethered cell assays. However, a double mutant lacking both CheV <b>and</b> <b>CheW</b> has a strong tumble bias, does not respond to addition of attractant, and shows essentially no accumulation in capillary assays. Thus, CheV <b>and</b> <b>CheW</b> appear in part to be functionally redundant. A strain lacking <b>CheW</b> <b>and</b> expressing only the CheW domain of CheV is chemotactic, suggesting that the truncated CheV protein retains in vivo function. We speculate that CheV <b>and</b> <b>CheW</b> function together to couple CheA activation to methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein receptor status and that possible CheA-dependent phosphorylation of CheV contributes to adaptation...|$|R
5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting <b>and</b> <b>chewing</b> on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the Socrates pain assessment method (see table).|$|E
5|$|The trains {{operate at}} a {{frequency}} {{of one to}} two minutes to five to ten minutes between 05:00 and 00:00, depending upon the peak and off-peak hours. Trains operating within the network typically travel at speed up to , and stop for about 20 seconds at each station. Automated station announcements are recorded in Hindi and English. Many stations have services such as ATMs, food outlets, cafés, convenience stores and mobile recharge. Eating, drinking, smoking <b>and</b> <b>chewing</b> of gum are prohibited in the entire system. The Metro also has a sophisticated fire alarm system for advance warning in emergencies, and fire retardant material is used in trains {{as well as on}} the premises of stations. Navigation information is available on Google Transit. Since October 2010, the first coach of every train is reserved for women. However, last coaches are also reserved when the train changes tracks at the terminal stations in the Red, Green and Violet Lines. To make travelling by metro a smoother experience, Delhi Metro has launched its own official app for smartphone users,(iPhone and Android) that will provide information on various facilities like nearest metro station, fare, parking availability, tourist spots near metro stations, security and emergency helpline numbers.|$|E

25|$|Mannitol {{increases}} {{blood glucose}} {{to a lesser}} extent than sucrose (thus having a relatively low glycemic index) so is used as a sweetener for people with diabetes, and in chewing gums. Although mannitol has a higher heat of solution than most sugar alcohols, its comparatively low solubility reduces the cooling effect usually found in mint candies and gums. However, when mannitol is completely dissolved in a product, it induces a strong cooling effect. Also, it has a very low hygroscopicity – it does not pick up water from the air until the humidity level is 98%. This makes mannitol very useful as a coating for hard candies, dried fruits, <b>and</b> <b>chewing</b> gums, and it is often included as an ingredient in candies <b>and</b> <b>chewing</b> gum. The pleasant taste and mouthfeel of mannitol also makes it a popular excipient for chewable tablets.|$|E

25|$|Treatment is by reassurance, as the {{condition}} is benign, and then by correction of any predisposing factors. This may be cessation of smoking or cessation/substitution of implicated medications or mouthwashes. Generally direct measures to return the tongue to its normal appearance involve improving oral hygiene, especially scraping or brushing the tongue before sleep. This promotes desquamation of the hyperparakeratotic papillae. Keratolytic agents (chemicals to remove keratin) such as podophyllin are successful, but carry safety concerns. Other reported successful measures include sodium bicarbonate mouthrinses, eating pineapple, sucking on a peach stone <b>and</b> <b>chewing</b> gum.|$|E
25|$|These {{works were}} all {{published}} {{in an era}} before the cigarette had become the dominant form of tobacco consumption and pipes, cigars, <b>and</b> <b>chewing</b> tobacco were still commonplace. Many of the books were published in novel packaging that would attract the learned smoking gentleman. Pipe and Pouch came in a leather bag resembling a tobacco pouch and Cigarettes in Fact and Fancy (1901) came bound in leather, packaged in an imitation cardboard cigar box. By the late 1920s, the publication {{of this type of}} literature largely abated and was only sporadically revived in the later 20th century.|$|E
