5|$|Finn {{manages to}} steal the crown, hoping to sell it instead of Bartram. In town, however, the Destiny Gang steal the crown as well as Bartram. Finn, furious, riles up the town, who begin to riot, as they <b>are</b> <b>sick</b> of being abused by the Destiny Gang. Finn goes to the Destiny Gang's mansion to confront their leader, Big Destiny. Once there, Big Destiny returns the crown, noting {{that it is the}} last {{possession}} that he will ever own. Finn looks out the window and sees that the gang is burning the city. Finn races to his home, taking Marceline with him. When he arrives at his house, the gang has already set it on fire with his parents and infant sibling trapped upstairs. Finn asks Marceline if the crown is magic and she tells him it is very dangerous magic. He then puts the crown on his head, and the power begins to flow through him.|$|E

25|$|Regarding health care, Ron Paul {{said that}} “managed care isn’t working” and that “drug {{companies}} lobby for managed care”. Paul said, “We {{could take care}} of these poor people if we weren’t trying to maintain an empire overseas”. Ron Paul hit continued to discuss the issue of military non-interventionism, “70% of Americans want war over with and <b>are</b> <b>sick</b> and tired of big government at home and overseas”. They want their “civil liberties and not allow government to spend endlessly and bankrupt us”. Paul also answered questions related to his experience with Medicaid and endorsed allowing civil unions for same-sex couples country-wide, with marriage itself handled solely by religious institutions.|$|E
25|$|June 15, 2005 - Paul Martin's {{minority}} government survives {{no fewer}} than 16 confidence votes in the House of Commons. A defeat on any {{of them would have}} forced an election. But in the end, there was no repeat of the single-vote squeaker win of May 19. The closest vote passed 153 to 149; Gurmant Grewal is on stress leave over the tape scandal, two other conservative MPs <b>are</b> <b>sick</b> with cancer, and Thibault from the BQ is away due to the passing away of her father. As well, a series of public opinion polls released just days earlier all showed the Liberals in the lead, one of them released just a week ago showing the Liberals have a 14% lead over the Tories. The Tories seem themselves to not be wanting an election now, either.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} no dietary {{restrictions}} in the Bahá'í Faith, `Abdu'l-Bahá, {{the son of the}} religion's founder, noted that a vegetarian diet consisting of fruits and grains was desirable, except for people with a weak constitution or those that <b>are</b> <b>sick.</b> He stated that {{there are no}} requirements that Bahá'ís become vegetarian, but that a future society should gradually become vegetarian. `Abdu'l-Bahá also stated that killing animals was contrary to compassion. While Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá'í Faith {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, stated that a purely vegetarian diet would be preferable since it avoided killing animals, both he and the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the Bahá'ís have stated that these teachings do not constitute a Bahá'í practice and that Bahá'ís can choose to eat whatever they wish but should be respectful of others' beliefs.|$|E

25|$|Anesthesia {{of exotic}} animals (guinea pigs, rabbits, birds) is {{challenging}} {{and the higher}} peri-anesthetic mortality in these species compared to dogs and cats, attests to this fact. These animals are challenging to anesthetize {{for a number of}} reasons: very little research has been carried out on safe and effective drug doses for specific species; exotic pets often 'hide' the fact that they <b>are</b> <b>sick</b> and by the time owners realize how sick the pet is the course of the disease is far advanced; the unique anatomy and physiology of exotic pets poses challenges for anesthetic management. For example, the anatomy of the respiratory system of birds, Guinea pigs, and reptiles makes it difficult to induce and maintain anesthesia solely with inhalation agents such as isoflurane and sevoflurane. Injectable drugs such as sedatives or tranquilizers are often used in these patients to facilitate induction and maintenance of anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|Managed {{care plans}} are widely {{credited}} with subduing medical cost inflation {{in the late}} 1980s by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations, forcing providers to discount their rates, and causing {{the health care industry}} to become more efficient and competitive. Managed care plans and strategies proliferated and quickly became nearly ubiquitous in the U.S. However, this rapid growth led to a consumer backlash. Because many managed care health plans are provided by for-profit companies, their cost-control efforts created widespread perception that they were more interested in saving money than providing health care. In a 2004 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a majority of those polled said they believed that managed care decreased the time doctors spend with patients, made it harder for people who <b>are</b> <b>sick</b> to see specialists, and had failed to produce significant health care savings. These public perceptions have been fairly consistent in polling since 1997.|$|E
25|$|Rubella, {{also known}} as German measles or three-day measles, is an {{infection}} caused by the rubella virus. This disease is often mild with half of people not realizing that they <b>are</b> <b>sick.</b> A rash may start around two weeks after exposure and last for three days. It usually starts on the face and spreads {{to the rest of}} the body. The rash is not as bright as that of measles and is sometimes itchy. Swollen lymph nodes are common and may last a few weeks. A fever, sore throat, and fatigue may also occur. In adults joint pain is common. Complications may include bleeding problems, testicular swelling, and inflammation of nerves. Infection during early pregnancy may result in a child born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) or miscarriage. Symptoms of CRS include problems with the eyes such as cataracts, ears such as deafness, heart, and brain. Problems are rare after the 20th week of pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|Some have {{suggested}} that the notion of eternal return is related to the overman, since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the overman is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or asceticism. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the overman, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the overman in order to will the eternal recurrence; that is, only the overman will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really <b>are</b> <b>sick,</b> not because of any choice they made.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{hardcore}} punk was developing primarily in Southern California and Washington, D.C. The New York hardcore scene {{was founded by}} 1981, and bands such as Reagan Youth and Kraut led the initial charge. By 1985, the New York hardcore scene had become inhabited by straight edgers and skinheads, including bands such as Agnostic Front, Cro-Mags, Heart Attack, Youth of Today, The Plasmatics, Warzone, and Murphy's Law. With {{the collapse of the}} CBGB hardcore matinees due to constant violence, a more activist DIY scene began to develop around ABC No Rio and the squats of the Lower East Side. New York has {{been at the center of}} the United States third wave ska scene. The founders of third wave ska, which drew on British Two-Tone ska, were New York bands such as the Toasters and Urban Blight. In the early 1980s, Toasters singer/guitarist and songwriter Robert 'Bucket' Hingley established Moon Ska Records; the label operated until the late 1990s, giving many ska bands from New York and elsewhere international exposure. Some of the other ska bands to come from the New York scene were Skinnerbox, The Slackers, and Mephiskapheles. Other major hardcore punk bands from New York <b>are</b> <b>Sick</b> of It All, H2O, and Madball. There are also ska-jazz bands, such as the New York Ska Jazz Ensemble.|$|E

[...] However, potent drugs were used on certain occasions. This passive approach was very successful in treating relatively simple ailments such as broken bones which required traction to stretch the skeletal system and relieve pressure on the injured area.
