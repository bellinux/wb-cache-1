Piwo, about the adventures of a wooden horse, became his first comic album in 1943, and was followed by two sequels in 1944 and 1946. Those comics were also published in French. For the same editor, he illustrated 11 children books. In the same years, he also created the cover illustration {{for a number of}} novels from other publishers. In 1944, he also started working for two more magazines, De Rakker and De Illustratie, where he created some comics and made numerous illustrations. To help him with <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> his wife Paula inked many of his pencil drawings in these years.|$|E

The {{public face of}} Blue Book {{continued}} to be the official Air Force investigation of UFOs, but the reality was it had essentially been reduced to doing very little serious investigation, and had become almost solely a public relations outfit with a debunking mandate. To cite one example, {{by the end of}} 1956, the number of cases listed as unsolved had dipped to barely 0.4 percent, from the 20 to 30% only a few years earlier.|$|E
25|$|The {{glass inside}} a {{cylinder}} {{is usually a}} black glossy substance. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> (in the United Kingdom) is done using hot cell systems. Sugar is added to control the ruthenium chemistry and to stop {{the formation of the}} volatile RuO4 containing radioactive ruthenium isotopes. In the West, the glass is normally a borosilicate glass (similar to Pyrex), while in the former Soviet bloc it is normal to use a phosphate glass. The amount of fission products in the glass must be limited because some (palladium, the other Pt group metals, and tellurium) tend to form metallic phases which separate from the glass. Bulk vitrification uses electrodes to melt soil and wastes, which are then buried underground. In Germany a vitrification plant is in use; this is treating the waste from a small demonstration reprocessing plant which has since been closed down.|$|E

Though Massey was honoured for <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> by being inducted in 1946 by King George VI into the Order of the Companions of Honour, upon his return to Canada Massey continued in the same fields. He sat as chair of the National Gallery of Canada from 1948 to 1952 and was selected as Chancellor of the University of Toronto between 1948 and 1953. In 1949, Massey's artistic expertise was of benefit when he was appointed {{as the head of the}} Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences, which ultimately resulted in the Massey Report of 1951 and from there to the establishment of the National Library of Canada and the Canada Council of the Arts. All this Massey continued despite the death of his wife in July 1950.|$|E
500|$|Two airfields were constructed, Inshore and North Cape. These {{were heavy}} bomber strips, [...] long and [...] wide. The former had parking for 210 fighters or light bombers; the latter for 84 heavy bombers. Both were fully {{equipped}} with towers, lighting, and a dispensary. The aviation tank farm {{consisted of three}} [...] storage tanks and nineteen [...] storage tanks, together with the appropriate filling and distribution points. A reserve of [...] was stored in drums. Three hospitals were established, a 100-bed naval base hospital, the 160-bed 24th Army Field Hospital, and the 150-bed Acorn 7 Hospital.

500|$|The {{time needed}} by the British to organise the {{landings}} meant that Sanders, Colonel Hans Kannengiesser and other German officers, supported by III Corps commander Esat Pasha, {{had more time to}} prepare their defences. Sanders later noted, [...] "the British allowed us four good weeks of respite for <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> before their great disembarkation... This respite just sufficed for the most indispensable measures to be taken." [...] Roads were constructed, small boats built to carry troops and equipment across the Narrows, beaches were wired and improvised mines were constructed from torpedo warheads. Trenches and gun emplacements were dug along the beaches and troops went on route marches to avoid lethargy. Kemal, whose 19th Division was vital to the defensive scheme, observed the beaches and awaited signs of an invasion from his post at Boghali, near Maidos. The Ottomans created a small air force with German assistance and had four aircraft operating around Çanakkale in February, conducting reconnaissance and army co-operation sorties, From 11 April, an Ottoman aircraft made frequent flights over Mudros, keeping watch on the assembly of the British naval force and an airfield was established near Gallipoli.|$|E

500|$|This {{long period}} of wall-building {{burdened}} the populace and provoked controversy. Sometime between 1190 and 1196, during Zhangzong's reign, the high official Zhang Wangong (張萬公) and the Censorate recommended that work on the wall be indefinitely suspended due to a recent drought, noting: [...] "What has been begun is already being flattened by sandstorms, and bullying the people into defence works will simply exhaust them." [...] However, Chancellor Wanyan Xiang (完顏襄) convinced the emperor of the walls' merits based on an optimistic cost estimate – [...] "Although the initial outlay for the walls will be one million strings of cash, when the work is done the frontier will be secure with only half the present number of soldiers needed to defend it, which means that every year you will save three million strings of cash... The benefits will be everlasting" [...] – and so construction continued unabated. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> created an extensive systems of walls, which consisted of a [...] "outer wall" [...] from Heilongjiang to Mongolia and a [...] network of [...] "inner walls" [...] north and northeast of Beijing. Together, they formed a roughly elliptical web of fortifications [...] in length and [...] in diameter.

The old tracery of the Chapel and Library windows, renewed during the restoration, was taken over to Denton House near Cuddesdon, where some alterations were made by a relative of the then Warden of All Souls. It was built into the wall surrounding the garden, the east window being set up entire. The south wall was left till 1848 and the ante-chapel until 1869, when plans were sent for refacing it in stone, and for restoring the pinnacles in Tainton stone, at the cost of £940 16s. This work was then carried out.|$|E

Aside from this, he was busy working for Harvard University and other institutions, giving talks at large congresses and conducting a topographical examinations of north Florida in 1882. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> demanded so much from him that his now-grown son had completely taken over the pharmacy since Mohr's health had been overstrained by his exploration work. He was given an honorary doctoral degree by the University of Alabama in 1893 in recognition of his work. In 1900, he moved to Asheville, North Carolina, where {{he worked on the}} large Biltmore Herbarium while compiling his beloved [...] "Economic Botany of Alabama", about weeds, medicinal-, poisonous- and commercial-plants.

2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{resignation}} Profumo {{began to work}} as a volunteer cleaning toilets at Toynbee Hall, a charity based in the East End of London, and continued to work there {{for the rest of his}} life. Peter Hitchens has written that Profumo [...] "vanished into London's East End for 40 years, doing quiet good works". Profumo [...] "had to be persuaded to lay down his mop and lend a hand running the place", eventually becoming Toynbee Hall's chief fundraiser, and used his political skills and contacts to raise large sums of money. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> was done as a volunteer, since Profumo was able to live on his inherited wealth. His wife, the actress Valerie Hobson, also devoted herself to charity until her death in 1998. In the eyes of most commentators, Profumo's charity work redeemed his reputation. His friend, social reform campaigner Lord Longford said he [...] "felt more admiration [...] than [...] all the men I've known in my lifetime".|$|E
2500|$|The {{step from}} optics to {{dynamics}} {{in the application}} of the method of [...] "Varying Action" [...] was made in 1827, and communicated to the Royal Society, in whose Philosophical Transactions for 1834 and 1835 there are two papers on the subject, which, like the [...] "Systems of Rays," [...] display a mastery over symbols and a flow of mathematical language almost unequaled. The common thread running through <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> is Hamilton's principle of [...] "Varying Action". Although {{it is based on the}} calculus of variations and may be said to belong to the general class of problems included under the principle of least action which had been studied earlier by Pierre Louis Maupertuis, Euler, Joseph Louis Lagrange, and others, Hamilton's analysis revealed much deeper mathematical structure than had been previously understood, in particular the symmetry between momentum and position. Paradoxically, the credit for discovering the quantity now called the Lagrangian and Lagrange's equations belongs to Hamilton. Hamilton's advances enlarged greatly the class of mechanical problems that could be solved, and they represent perhaps the greatest addition which dynamics had received since the work of Isaac Newton and Lagrange. Many scientists, including Liouville, Jacobi, Darboux, Poincaré, Kolmogorov, and Arnold, have extended Hamilton's work, thereby expanding our knowledge of mechanics and differential equations.|$|E

2500|$|Although a {{large number}} of Bible manuscripts {{resulted}} from <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> no standard Vulgate text was established for another three centuries. Marsden points out, in discussing how the Gallican version of the Psalter came to become established as the text of the psalms in the Vulgate Bible: [...] "Its dominant position was in fact not assured before the early 13th century, and even then was not universal". [...] However, the explosive growth of medieval universities, especially the University of Paris during the 12th century, created a demand for a new sort of Vulgate. University scholars needed the entire Bible in a single, portable and comprehensive volume; which they could rely on to include all biblical texts which they might encounter in partristic references. [...] The result was the Paris Bible, which reached its final form around 1230. Its text owed most to Alcuin's revision, and always presented the psalms in the Gallican version; but readings throughout were in many places adjusted to be more consistent with patristic citations (which would very frequently have been based on Old Latin or Greek texts). The book of Baruch and Letter of Jeremiah were now always included, as too were 3 Esdras, and usually (appended to the book of Chronicles) the Prayer of Manasses. Less commonly included was 4 Esdras.|$|E
