5|$|Seymour {{maintained}} {{a reputation as}} a courageous and innovative officer: he was awarded a commemorative medal for his actions at the battle of the Glorious First of June and is credited with introducing epaulettes to Royal Navy uniforms as a method of indicating rank to non-English speaking allies. In his youth he formed close personal friendships with fellow officer John Willett Payne and George, Prince of Wales, through association with whom he gained {{a reputation as a}} rake. His marriage in 1785, made at the insistence of his family <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> his dissolution, was brought about through royal connections and proved very successful. During his lifetime he also held several seats as a member of parliament in the Parliament of Great Britain, although he did not pursue an active political career.|$|E
5|$|Waugh's {{health in}} the winter of 1953–54 was indifferent, and he was beset with various {{personal}} anxieties that were stifling his ability to work. He was also consuming alcohol, bromide and chloral in large amounts. In search of a peaceful environment in which he could resume writing, he embarked on a sea voyage to Ceylon, but was driven to the point of madness by imagined voices that assailed him throughout the voyage. These experiences are mirrored in the novel by those of Pinfold, a successful writer in the Waugh mould who, <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> his lassitude and chronic insomnia, is dosing himself with a similar regimen of drugs. This cocktail brings about a series of hallucinatory episodes during a sea voyage taken by Pinfold {{for the sake of his}} health; he hears voices that insult, taunt and threaten him. He leaves the ship, but his unseen tormentors follow him. On his return to England, his wife convinces him that the voices were imaginary, and his doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and chloral mixture. Pinfold, however, also views the episode as a private victory over the forces of evil.|$|E

25|$|Hydroxocobalamin {{is another}} form of B12 {{commonly}} encountered in pharmacology, but which is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B12a. This form of B12 is the form produced by bacteria, and is what is converted to cyanocobalmin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for cyanide ions and has been used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin {{is thought to be}} converted to the active enzymic forms of B12 more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for pediatric patients with intrinsic cobalamin metabolic diseases, for vitamin B12 deficient patients with tobacco amblyopia (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.|$|E

Like the bands that are the fucking hardest rocking are like, 'We'll fucking kick your ass, dude... with our rock.'" [...] Russell Brand, All Shall Perish, The Lonely Island, and Kanye West have in turn been influenced by the work of Tenacious D.|$|E

500|$|During December 1922 and January 1923 Lenin {{dictated}} [...] "Lenin's Testament", {{in which}} he discussed the personal qualities of his comrades, particularly Trotsky and Stalin. He recommended that Stalin {{be removed from the}} position of General Secretary of the Communist Party, deeming him ill-suited for the position. Instead he recommended Trotsky for the job, describing him as [...] "the most capable man in the present Central Committee"; he highlighted Trotsky's superior intellect {{but at the same time}} criticised his self-assurance and inclination toward excess administration. During this period he dictated a criticism of the bureaucratic nature of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, calling for the recruitment of new, working-class staff <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> this problem, while in another article he called for the state to combat illiteracy, promote punctuality and conscientiousness within the populace, and encourage peasants to join cooperatives.|$|E

500|$|Rothbard embraced [...] "historical revisionism" [...] <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> what he {{perceived}} to be the dominant influence exerted by corrupt [...] "court intellectuals" [...] over mainstream historical narratives. Rothbard wrote that these mainstream intellectuals distorted the historical record in favor of [...] "the state" [...] in exchange for [...] "wealth, power, and prestige" [...] from the state. Rothbard characterized the revisionist task as [...] "penetrating the fog of lies and deception of the State and its Court Intellectuals, and to present to the public the true history". He was influenced by and called a champion of the historian Harry Elmer Barnes, a Holocaust denier. Rothbard endorsed Barnes's revisionism on World War II, favorably citing his view that [...] "the murder of Germans and Japanese was the overriding aim of World War II". In addition to broadly supporting his historical views, Rothbard promoted Barnes as an influence for future revisionists.|$|E
40|$|Single-gene {{mutations}} {{can produce}} human progeroid syndromes—phenotypes that mimic usual or “normative” aging. These {{can be divided}} into two classes—those that have their impacts upon multiple organs and tissues (segmental progeroid syndromes) and those that have their major impacts upon a single organ or tissue (unimodal progeroid syndromes). The prototypic example of the former is the Werner syndrome, a condition caused by mutations of the RecQ family of DNA helicases. Research on the Werner syndrome and a surprising number of other progeroid syndromes support the importance of the maintenance of genomic stability <b>as</b> <b>a</b> partial <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> aging. The prototypic examples of the latter are Alzheimer type dementias. The three gene products that cause rare autosomal-dominant early-onset varieties of these disorders all participate in the modulation of the β amyloid precursor protein. They thus support the importance of the maintenance of proper protein processing and folding <b>as</b> <b>a</b> partial <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> aging...|$|R

40|$|Sulfidation is {{considered}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> natural <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> toxicity of metallic nanoparticles (NPs). The detoxification contribution from sulfidation, however, may {{vary depending on}} sulfidation mechanisms. Here we present the dissolution-precipitation instead of direct solid-state-shell mechanism to illustrate the process of CuO-NPs conversion to CuS-NPs in aqueous solutions. Accordingly, the CuS-NPs at environmentally relevant concentrations showed much stronger interference on Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryo hatching than CuO-NPs, which was probably due to elevated free copper ions released from CuS-NPs, leading to significant increase in oxidative stress and causing toxicity in embryos. The larval length was significantly reduced by CuS-NPs, however, no other obviously abnormal morphological features were identified in the hatched larvae. Co-introduction of a metal ion chelator [ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) ] could abolish the hatching inhibition induced by CuS-NPs, indicating free copper ions released from CuS-NPs {{play an important role}} in hatching interference. This work documents for the first time that sulfidation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> natural <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> metallic NPs is being overestimated, which has far reaching implications for risk assessment of metallic NPs in aquatic environment...|$|R
500|$|When Stead {{was only}} halfway done, she hit a wall: she {{wondered}} if she had focused the novel too much on her own personal life and problems. By her 40th birthday in January 2008, she had stopped writing. One week after her birthday celebration, Stead went to a writers' conference where the presenter advised attendees to stop thinking and just write. This speech worked <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> Stead's writer's block; she started working on When You Reach Me again. After she had written two-thirds of the novel, Stead sent the draft to her editor Wendy Lamb at Random House. Perusing the script, Lamb found herself absorbed and wanted to help develop the book. Unlike Stead's debut novel First Light, which Lamb heavily edited, Lamb modified nothing on the first draft of When You Reach Me. Throughout the process, Stead helped Lamb understand the complicated concepts in the book and had drafts read by others to make sure [...] "revision hadn't created any holes or contradictions in the plot".|$|E

Nevertheless, Mwng was ranked number 24 in the magazine's [...] "Albums of the year 2000" [...] feature. Website SonicNet described the record as a slightly retro album that sees the Super Furry Animals [...] "refashion the past into the present". Art Sperl, writing for Rock's Backpages in December 2000, stated that {{although the}} album [...] " [...] from the past", the band's influences are channelled [...] "into a truly organic maverick pop".
