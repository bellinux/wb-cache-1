40|$|The {{effects of}} {{lidocaine}} {{have been examined}} on the arrhythmogenic transient inward current (ITI) in voltage-clamped sheep cardiac Purkinje fibres. Tension and intracellular Na activity (aiNa) were measured simultaneously. The addition of lidocaine (200 - 300 microM) produced an immediate decrease of inward holding current and a gradual fall of aiNa. The relative magnitudes of the changes of current and aiNa were shown {{to be consistent with}} the outward shift of current representing principally a reduction of inward Na current. The Na pump was inhibited by reducing the external Rb concentration in a K-free solution. This produced an <b>after-contraction</b> and transient inward current (ITI) along with a rise of aiNa. The subsequent addition of lidocaine decreased the magnitude of ITI and the <b>after-contraction</b> while decreasing aiNa. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) had qualitatively similar effects to lidocaine on inward holding current, aiNa, ITI and the <b>after-contraction.</b> When aiNa was changed by (i) lidocaine, (ii) TTX or (iii) small changes of external Rb concentration, a hysteresis was seen in the relationship between aiNa and ITI or <b>after-contraction.</b> The hysteresis was similar to that previously found between aiNa and contraction (Eisner, Lederer & Vaughan-Jones, 1981). Despite this hysteresis, neither lidocaine nor TTX affected the relationship between magnitudes of ITI and the <b>after-contraction.</b> It is suggested that the fall of aiNa is {{a major factor in the}} reduction of ITI by lidocaine. These results are discussed in relation to the anti-arrhythmic actions of lidocaine...|$|E

Adenosine triphosphate (0. 06 - 2 X 10 (- 3) M) and noradrenaline (1 - 16 X 10 (- 7) M) produced a rapid inhibition of spontaneous tone with a prominent <b>after-contraction,</b> especially on washout. Both the inhibitory effect and the rebound contraction were abolished by apamin (10 (- 7) M). Exposure to both BRL 34915 (64 X 10 (- 7) M) and to nicorandil (64 X 10 (- 6) M) produced {{an increase in the}} 86 Rb efflux rate coefficient which was unaffected by apamin (10 (- 7) M).

40|$|It {{is an old}} {{observation}} that non-volitional arm abduction movements accompanied by a sensation of arm lightness often occur as an after-effect following forceful voluntary arm abductor contractions against a restraint. In the present study we have tested the hypothesis that such non-volitional, so-called ‘postural after-contractions’ are tonic reflex responses to an enhanced resting discharge in primary muscle spindle afferents {{which in turn is}} a consequence of thixotropy-dependent enhanced stiffness of intrafusal muscle fibres. Results obtained in ten volunteers show that the arm abductor <b>after-contraction</b> phenomenon in man is most readily evoked by a type of conditioning procedure which in various respects mimics the procedure proven in animal experiments to be particularly effective in producing thixotropy-dependent excitation of primary spindle endings. It is also shown that changes in arm abductor intramuscular temperature affect the strength of the after-contractions in a direction predicted by the thixotropy hypothesis. Attention is drawn to several similarities between the <b>after-contraction</b> phenomenon with accompanying sensory illusions and the tonic reflex responses and illusions that can be induced when primary spindle endings are excited by muscle vibration. The results support our hypothesis that postural after-contractions are induced by activity in primary muscle spindle afferents as a consequence of thixotropic properties of intrafusal muscle fibres. Central excitability changes following the conditioning voluntary effort may contribute to the phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} the biochemical basis of hereditary muscle diseases in an experimental mammal, we performed polypeptide analyses on skeletal muscles of neuromuscular mutants of the mouse. In one of these, "arrested development of righting response" (adr), {{the concentration of}} the soluble Ca 2 +-binding protein parvalbumin was drastically reduced in comparison to wild type. This reduction was not an unspecific consequence of muscle disease, as it was not observed in two other neuromuscular mouse mutants, "wobbler" (wr) and "motor endplate disease" (med or medjo). Isometric twitches of adr muscle had only slightly prolonged contraction and half-relaxation times, yet long-lasting <b>after-contractions</b> were observed upon repeated (20 - 100 Hz) direct stimulation. Thus, parvalbumin may be mainly involved in the relaxation after tetanic contraction of fast-twitch fibers...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to investigate the mechanism of action of DPI 201 - 106 on human heart muscle. In both control and myopathic muscles, DPI produced concentration-dependent increases in action potential duration, resting muscle tension, peak isometric tension, and duration of isometric tension. These changes were associated with increases in resting intracellular calcium and peak calcium transients as measured by aequorin. At higher concentrations of DPI, a second delayed Ca 2 + transient (L') appeared. L' was inhibited by tetrodotoxin and ryanodine, suggesting that DPI acts at both the sarcolemma and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. DPI toxicity was manifested by after-glimmers and <b>after-contractions</b> reflecting a Ca 2 +-overload state: DPI effects were mimicked by veratridine, a Na+ channel agonist, and reversed by tetrodotoxin, yohimbine, and cadmium, Na+ channel antagonists. These results suggest that DPI acts primarily as a Na+ channel agonist. DPI may produce an increase in intracellular Ca 2 + by increasing intracellular Na+ and altering Na+-Ca 2 + exchange across the sarcolemma. DPI may also increase intracellular Ca 2 + by directly altering sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + handling...|$|R
40|$|The small calcium (Ca 2 +) binding protein S 100 A 1 is as a {{critical}} regulator of cardiomyocyte Ca 2 + handling thereby enhancing cardiac performance in vivo and in vitro. Our previous studies demonstrated that the positive inotropic effects of S 100 A 1 are due to enhanced Ca 2 + transients and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2 + load in isolated adult cardiomyocytes. These effects are independent of {{and in addition to}} cAMP-dependent positive inotropic mechanisms. However, inotropic interventions come at the risk of arrhythmogenic diastolic Ca 2 + leakage when the SR Ca 2 + content exceeds the threshold for spontaneous diastolic Ca 2 + release. In a more recent study we could demonstrate that enhanced Ca 2 + transients after S 100 A 1 overexpression are associated with a reduced incidence of diastolic Ca 2 + sparks and Ca 2 + waves. These results favor the assumption that S 100 A 1 might reduce the diastolic RyR 2 leak, thereby impeding the development of pro-arrhythmogenic events. Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate the effect of S 100 A 1 on diastolic Ca 2 + handling and on the impact of Ca 2 +-triggered arrhythmias in a multicellular system. For this reason, the 3 -dimensional tissue culture model of Engineered Heart Tissue (EHT) was chosen. Due to its syncytial architecture, EHT closely mimics functional alterations, intercellular communication and reverse remodeling of whole hearts in vivo despite eased handling and pharmacological as well as therapeutic manipulations. Pharmacological stimulation of EHT with endothelin- 1 resulted in a heart failure-like phenotype with strong impairment of contractile performance. Adenoviral-mediated S 100 A 1 overexpression was able to rescue failing EHT and resulted in superior contractility in normal EHT. Triggered contraction abnormalities, referred to as <b>after-contractions,</b> were induced by Ca 2 + and β-AR stimulation and served as a surrogate of SOICR (store-overload-induced-Ca 2 +-release). S 100 A 1 overexpression significantly protected against Ca 2 + and β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) triggered <b>after-contractions</b> in normal and failing EHT. Despite persistent abnormal phosphorylation-dependent changes at the RyR 2 and altered complex formation with accessory proteins, S 100 A 1 overexpression enhanced S 100 A 1 /RyR 2 stoichiometry, which seems to be key for S 100 A 1 ’s effects, combining inotropic and anti-arrhythmic potency...|$|R
40|$|Sheep cardiac Purkinje fibres were voltage clamped with a two-microelectrode technique. Under {{conditions}} that are known to elevate intracellular calcium (0 mM-external potassium), membrane currents were examined. In the above conditions, a brief depolarizing pulse leads to an oscillatory inward current (ITI) which peaks at about 300 ms after the repolarization. An <b>after-contraction</b> is also observed, the peak of which occurs about 80 ms after the peak of ITI. This result is {{in accord with the}} results of Kass, Lederer, Tsien & Weingart (1978 a). We replaced external sodium with an isotonic CaCl 2 solution to remove the sodium-calcium exchange mechanism as a possible current carrier for ITI. In the steady state under these conditions an oscillatory membrane current and <b>after-contraction</b> are seen following repolarization. This current was identified as ITI {{on the basis of its}} temporal relation to both the repolarization step and the <b>after-contraction.</b> In isotonic CaCl 2, ITI has a reversal potential of - 37 mV. Because of this fact ITI cannot be explained by an electrogenic sodium-calcium exchange mechanism alone. The reversal potential suggests that ITI arises from a channel which is permeable to both potassium and calcium. Fluctuations of membrane current and of tension were recorded in the steady state at different holding potentials. Power spectral analysis showed that the current fluctuations were at a minimum at a holding potential of - 37 mV. Tension fluctuations were, however, relatively constant over the range of membrane potentials examined (- 17 to - 70 mV). The peak power of the current fluctuations occurred at about 1. 5 Hz (at a holding potential of - 70 mV). This peak shifted towards higher frequencies with increasing depolarization. A similar shift in frequency was observed for the tension fluctuations. Cross-correlations between membrane current and tension were calculated for various steady membrane potentials. This analysis shows that the current fluctuations are associated with the tension fluctuations, each with a principal period of about 0. 5 s. This analysis also shows that at potentials more negative than the reversal potential of ITI, increasing tension is associated with increasing inward current and that the tension fluctuations follow current fluctuations by about 70 ms. At potentials positive to the reversal potential of ITI, increasing tension was associated with increasing outward current. This analysis therefore indicates that the fluctuations in membrane current reverse at a potential similar to the reversal potential of ITI. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{caffeine}} were examined on contraction and membrane current in voltage-clamped sheep cardiac Purkinje fibres. The photoprotein aequorin was injected into several cells {{in order to}} measure the intracellular ionized Ca concentration [(Ca 2 +]i). When the Na-K pump was inhibited, depolarization produced a twitch followed by a tonic component of tension. Repolarization produced an <b>after-contraction.</b> These components of tension were accompanied by corresponding increases of aequorin light. Caffeine (10 mM) decreased both the twitch and the <b>after-contraction</b> while increasing the tonic component. The application of caffeine also produced a transient increase of aequorin light, both during depolarization and at rest, which was followed by a maintained decrease in all three components of the light signal. In particular, although caffeine decreased the rise of aequorin light during prolonged depolarization it increased the tonic tension. The possibility that the effects of caffeine on tonic tension could be due to suppression of spontaneous Ca oscillations was rejected for the following reasons. (i) Ryanodine (which also abolishes Ca oscillations) decreased the magnitude of the tonic tension. (ii) Caffeine still increased tonic tension when it was added to a fibre exposed to ryanodine (1 - 10 microM). In the presence of ryanodine it was possible to measure [Ca 2 +]i and tonic tension without interference from Ca oscillations. The increase of tonic tension produced by caffeine could not be accounted for by a rise of [Ca 2 +]i. The results showed that, at a given level of Ca, caffeine increased tension. The results show that {{a large part of the}} increase of tonic tension produced by caffeine is due to an increase of the Ca sensitivity of the contractile apparatus rather than to changes of [Ca 2 +]i. The consequence of this observation for the experimental use of caffeine is discussed...|$|E

METHODS: Children with posturination dribbling underwent urodynamic studies. Patients with DA-C were randomly allocated {{to one of two}} groups: pelvic floor biofeedback training or 1 mg tolterodine, orally, twice daily. Treatment was continued for 12 weeks. RESULTS: The study included 45 children. DA-C was present in 39 patients (86. 6 %), 30 (76. 9 %) of whom also exhibited detrusor overactivity. Pelvic floor biofeedback training resulted in a significantly better response than tolterodine, in terms of {{reduction in the number of}} posturination dribbling events in the month after completion of treatment.

40|$|The photoprotein aequorin was {{injected}} into superficial cells of ferret papillary muscles. Tension and aequorin light (a function of intracellular [Ca 2 +]) were monitored. Increasing intracellular Ca concentration ([Ca 2 +]i), either by decreasing extracellular Na, or by inhibiting the Na pump with strophanthidin, produced spontaneous oscillations of [Ca 2 +]i and tension. Fourier {{analysis showed that}} these oscillations had frequencies of up to 3 - 4 Hz. If the muscle was stimulated in these conditions the Ca transient associated with the twitch {{was followed by a}} series of damped oscillations of [Ca 2 +]i which were accompanied by <b>after-contractions.</b> Under a given set of conditions the frequency of the stimulated oscillations was {{similar to that of the}} spontaneous oscillations. Manoeuvres which increase [Ca 2 +]i increased the frequency of both spontaneous and stimulated oscillations. Drugs which inhibit the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (caffeine and ryanodine) abolished both stimulated and spontaneous oscillations. The spontaneous oscillations during a Na-free contracture were unaffected by the Ca channel blocker D- 600. When repetitive stimulation was begun the frequency and magnitude of the stimulated oscillations increased over several minutes. Increasing the frequency of stimulation increased the magnitude of the stimulated oscillations. It is concluded that the spontaneous oscillations of [Ca 2 +]i may be due to oscillatory Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The similar properties of the spontaneous and stimulated oscillations suggest that the latter may be due to a synchronization of the former...|$|R

Li, sucrose and choline were used isosmotically as Na substitutes {{to evaluate the}} effect of altering the Na equilibrium potential. We were unable to detect outward Iti at any potential up to + 30 mV in normal or Na-depleted solutions. However, reduction of Na had a biphasic effect on Iti, initially increasing it and then reducing it at all clamp potentials from - 50 to + 20 mV. After-contractions were also initially increased and, in sufficiently Na-depleted solutions, decreased by reduction of extracellular Na. However, the peak in the <b>after-contraction</b> always occurred later than the increase in Iti and frequently coincided with the maximum suppression of the current. Complete suppression of after-contractions was not often achieved and always required more complete Na replacement than Iti suppression. Tonic tension responses were reduced by Na replacement, usually in synchrony with the reduction of Iti. The responses of Iti to Na replacement are consistent with a model of electrogenic Na-Ca exchange over the potential range positive to - 50 mV.

Inhibiting the Na-K pump either by exposing the preparation to a K-free solution or by adding the cardioactive steroid strophanthidin increased both aiNa and twitch tension and resulted {{in the development of}} tonic tension, <b>after-contractions</b> and a transient inward current (ITI). The increase of twitch tension was present at lower aiNa than that required to produce the other phenomena. The relationship between the magnitude of the twitch tension and aiNa was always non-linear. Twitch tension increased steeply with aiNa at first but the relationship flattened off at higher aiNa and tension eventually decreased. Over the steep range, the relationship between tension and aiNa could be represented as: twitch tension = b (aiNa) y where y had a mean value of 3. 2. Changing membrane potential or [Ca 2 +]o changed b but had little effect on y. Mn (2 mmol/l) greatly decreased twitch tension but, at least initially, had little effect on tonic tension.

ANCA induced after-contractions which followed the twitches evoked by either direct or indirect stimulation. In the intermittently stimulated muscle {{the height of the}} after-contractions decreased rather rapidly and in an oscillatory fashion. The maximum height of each <b>after-contraction</b> was attained after the twitch had reached its peak. AChE inhibition changed the shape of these after-contractions in the indirectly, but not in the directly stimulated diaphragm. After AChE inhibition, the after-contractions decreased more slowly and in a non-oscillatory manner. Similar phenomena were observed in vivo in the gastrocnemius-soleus muscles. The effects of ANCA in the AChE-inhibited and in the non-inhibited diaphragm could be mimicked by incubation in low chloride media. Addition of ouabain to the non-inhibited diaphragm treated with ANCA, caused an immediate and striking enhancement followed by a rapid loss of the after-contractions, whereas the twitches remained fairly constant. In the AChE-inhibited diaphragm treated with ANCA, ouabain caused no increase but only a rapid and complete decay of the after-contractions with a decrease of the twitches. It is suggested that after inhibition of the AChE in the ANCA-treated muscle fibre, the site of initiation of the repetitive action potentials which cause the after-contractions shifts from the transverse tubular system to the motor end-plate.

40|$|Organophosphorus (OP) {{pesticide}} toxicity is {{a global}} health problem. Respiratory failure due to neuromuscular transmission dysfunction accounts for about 300, 000 deaths annually in rural Asia. However, the clinical manifestation is complex, and {{described in terms of}} acute, intermediate, and chronic syndromes. The underlying mechanism of toxicity is still unclear. OP pesticides contain inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), for example dimethoate, emulsified in an organic solvent, typically cyclohexanone. A hypothesized mechanism is initial excitotoxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase followed by failure of neuromuscular synaptic transmission. I tested this electrophysiologically in vitro by measuring properties of spontaneous miniature endplate potentials (MEPPs) and evoked endplate potentials (EPPs) in isolated sciatic nerve/flexor digitorum brevis muscles from mice, bathed in HEPES-buffered mammalian physiological saline (MPS). Muscle action potentials were abolished with μ-conotoxin (2 μM). First, we tested the effects of plasma taken from Göttingen minipigs instilled orally (isofluorane anaesthesia) with a formulated pesticide (2. 5 ml/kg) whose active ingredient is dimethoate dissolved in cyclohexanone. This plasma abolished evoked synaptic transmission and increased spontaneous MEPP frequency within 60 - 180 minutes of bath application. However plasma from minipigs instilled with dimethoate alone produced no failure of transmission. Plasma contained either pesticide or dimethoate significantly increased the half decay time of EPPs. However, pesticide-plasma also contained the metabolites omethoate (100 μM) and cyclohexanol (5 mM). We found that bath application of omethoate alone caused a potent dose-dependent increase in EPP decay time. Cyclohexanol (5 mM) also increased EPP decay time but it also decreased both the excitability of axons and MEPP amplitude. In combination, omethoate and cyclohexanol produced greater disruption of neuromuscular transmission than either dimethoate or cyclohexanone, alone or in combination and this was particularly evident in isometric tension recordings, in which prolonged <b>after-contraction</b> and slow relaxation were observed during and immediately following tetanic stiumuation in the presence of omethoate and cyclohexanol. Voltage-clamp recordings of endplate currents (EPC) partially supported the EPP observations. Surprisingly, cyclohexanol-treated preparations showed no significant increase in EPC and MEPC decay time. However, there was some evidence of activity-dependent decline in MEPC amplitude in cyclohexanol while quantal content in these preparations showed evidence of an increase suggesting a homeostatic response in evoked transmitter release with cyclohexanol treatment. Analysis of presynaptic currents in cyclohexanol treated preparations also revealed preliminary evidence of sensitivity to cyclohexanol compared to control preparations. Finally, I tested the effects NMJ transmission of 24 hr exposure to OP pesticide and its metabolites using a novel organ culture system, utilising a mouse mutant (WldS) with a slow nerve degeneration phenotype. After incubation of 24 hrs with MPS + pesticides and metabolites, these muscles showed significant reduction in function (response to nerve stimuli with EPP/action potential ± MEPPs) compared to control cultures. Together, the data indicate that failure of neuromuscular transmission by pesticide-plasma cannot be explained solely by dimethoate-mediated inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. Rather, a combination of metabolic breakdown products exerts potent, harmful presynaptic and postsynaptic effects. Either blocking the metabolic conversion of the constituents of OP pesticides, or transiently blocking their effects on receptors may therefore be an effective strategy for treatment of OP pesticide toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Background Arsenic {{trioxide}} (As 2 O 3) {{is a new}} promising regimen {{for patients}} with a relapse of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), but causes life-threatening arrhythmias. This study aimed to investigate the incidence and mechanism of arrythmogenesis caused by As 2 O 3. Methods and Results Standard 12 -lead ECGs were monitored throughout As 2 O 3 therapy in 20 APL patients. As 2 O 3 (0. 15 mg/kg) significantly prolonged the corrected QT interval (QTc: 445 ± 7 to 517 ± 17 ms, means±SE, p< 0. 01), and also increased the QTc dispersion and transmural dispersion of repolarization. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardias and torsades de pointes occurred in 4 and 1 patients, respectively. The action potentials and isometric contraction were measured in guinea pig papillary muscles during As 2 O 3 perfusion (350 μmol/L). The action potential duration was prolonged (APD 90 : 150 ± 11 to 195 ± 12 ms at 60 min, p< 0. 01, n= 5) and perfusion of As 2 O 3 in a low K+ solution with a low stimulation rate augmented the prolongation of APD, and provoked early after-depolarizations and triggered activities. The prolonged exposure to As 2 O 3 induced muscle contracture, <b>after-contractions,</b> triggered activities and electromechanical alternans. Tetrodotoxin or butylated hydroxytoluene partially prevented the As 2 O 3 -induced prolongation of APD. Conclusions The prolonged QTc and spatial heterogeneity {{are responsible for the}} As 2 O 3 -induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias. In addition to prolongation of the APD, cellular Ca 2 + overload and lipid peroxidation might contribute to the electrophysiological abnormalities caused by As 2 O 3. rights:社団法人日本循環器学会rights:本文データは学協会の許諾に基づきCiNiiから複製したものであるrelation：isVersionOf:[URL]...|$|R
40|$|Some {{transient}} lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations (TLOSRs) {{are accompanied}} by gastro-oesophageal reflux and others are not. We aimed to investigate what factors determine the occurrence and type of reflux during TLOSRs. In 12 healthy subjects prolonged high-resolution manometry was performed. Reflux was detected using pH-impedance monitoring. A total of 219 TLOSRs were detected; no differences were observed between the duration of TLOSRs with liquid-containing reflux (20. 2 +/- 1. 0 s), gas reflux (17. 0 +/- 1. 0 s) and no reflux (19. 0 +/- 1. 0 s). Trans-sphincteric pressure gradient was similar in TLOSRs with liquid reflux (1. 6 +/- 0. 1 kPa), gas reflux (1. 5 +/- 0. 1 kPa) and no reflux (1. 7 +/- 0. 3 kPa). Prevalence, duration and amplitude of oesophageal pre-contractions and sphincteric <b>after-contractions</b> were not different for TLOSRs with and without reflux. The total number of TLOSRs decreased significantly from 8. 2 +/- 0. 8 in the first to 5. 7 +/- 0. 5 {{in the second and}} 4. 4 +/- 0. 6 in the third 70 -min recording period. The number of TLOSRs accompanied by liquid-containing reflux decreased from 4. 7 +/- 0. 9 to 3. 0 +/- 0. 4 to 1. 6 +/- 0. 4, while the numbers of TLOSRs with gas reflux remained unchanged (2. 1 +/- 0. 6 - 2. 1 +/- 0. 7 - 2. 2 +/- 0. 6). Besides, time after the meal, no differences were observed in the characteristics of TLOSRs with and without gastro-oesophageal reflux. We conclude that factors, other than TLOSR characteristics, are important of whether or not a TLOSR is reflux-relate...|$|R
40|$|The photoprotein aequorin was microinjected into cells on {{the surface}} of ferret {{papillary}} muscles. Tension and aequorin light, a function of intracellular Ca concentration ([Ca 2 +]i), were monitored. The preparations were exposed to increased concentrations of extracellular Ca ([Ca 2 +]o). Small increases in [Ca 2 +]o led to the usual increase in both the systolic light signal and the developed tension. However, high [Ca 2 +]o led to a fall in developed tension known as Ca overload. This fall of tension was seen at lower [Ca 2 +]o if the experiment was performed in the presence of strophanthidin. In conditions of Ca overload, the systolic light signal was either similar in amplitude or larger than the systolic light observed under conditions which did not lead to Ca overload. Oscillations of diastolic light were invariably present under conditions of Ca overload. These oscillations were accompanied by <b>after-contractions</b> which were small in relation to the magnitude of the aequorin light oscillations. During Ca overload, the variance of the amplitude of the systolic light signal was greater than could be accounted for by the random nature of the arrival of photons. Small systolic light signals occurred when there had been an oscillation of light in the diastolic period immediately preceding the systolic light signal. Large systolic light signals occurred when the preceding period (approximately 1 s) was free of oscillations of light. These observations suggest that if the sarcoplasmic reticulum (s. r.) has spontaneously released its contents of Ca as shown by a diastolic [Ca 2 +]i oscillation, then a stimulated systolic Ca signal occurring within about the next second is smaller, possibly because it takes longer than this period for the s. r. to reload with Ca. If this process occurs randomly in the various cells of the preparation, developed tension will be reduced because those cells which have a small Ca release will act as a compliance in series with cells which have a large Ca release...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{milrinone}} and piroximone {{were compared to}} those of isoprenaline, dibutyryl adenosine 3 ': 5 '-cyclic monophosphate (dibutyryl cyclic AMP), forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine, increased extracellular calcium [(Ca 2 +]o) and caffeine in ferret right ventricular papillary muscles that were loaded intracellularly with aequorin, a bioluminescent calcium indicator that emits light when it combines with calcium. The positive inotropic action of each drug, except caffeine, was associated {{with an increase in}} the peak amplitude of the aequorin light signal (i. e. intracellular Ca 2 + transient) reflecting an increased amount of calcium available for excitation-contraction coupling; the positive inotropic effect of caffeine appears to occur by other mechanisms. The time courses of the aequorin light signal and corresponding tension response were shortened by isoprenaline, forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, milrinone and piroximone; unchanged by increased [Ca 2 +]o and prolonged by caffeine, suggesting that the rates of Ca 2 + release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum were respectively increased, unchanged or decreased by these groups of drugs. Relative to changes in [Ca 2 +]o, the ratio of the peak of the aequorin light signal to the peak of the tension response was increased by isoprenaline, milrinone and piroximone, and decreased by caffeine, indicating that the Ca 2 +-sensitivity of the myofilaments was respectively decreased, and increased by these drugs. The effects of milrinone and piroximone on the amplitude and time course of the aequorin light signal, as they relate to changes in uptake and release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and to changes in the sensitivity of the myofilaments to Ca 2 +, are consistent with the findings that positive inotropic doses of these agents act by increasing intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP. Higher doses of milrinone and piroximone produced negative inotropic effects that were characterized by diminution of developed tension but no change or an increase in the amplitude of the aequorin light signal, suggesting a decrease in the sensitivity of the contractile elements to Ca 2 +. Toxic doses of milrinone, piroximone and isoprenaline were associated with development of a Ca 2 +-overload state characterized by the presence of after-glimmers, <b>after-contractions</b> and dysrhythmias, and by decreased amplitude of both the aequorin light signal and tension response. The negative inotropic and toxic effects of milrinone and piroximone can be explained only in part by increased intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP; we suggest that these drugs may have other cardiac actions...|$|R
