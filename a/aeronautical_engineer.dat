5|$|In 1985, the Smithsonian Institution {{commissioned}} <b>aeronautical</b> <b>engineer</b> Paul MacCready {{to build}} a half-scale working model of Quetzalcoatlus northropi. The replica was launched with a ground-based winch. It flew several times in 1986 and was filmed {{as part of the}} Smithsonian's IMAX film On the Wing. However, the model was not anatomically correct and embodied vertical and horizontal tail stabilizers that pterosaurs did not have. It also had a longer tail, changing the weight distribution.|$|E
5|$|No.1 Long Range Flight {{undertook}} {{intensive training}} in the lead-up to the race. This involved making regular long range return flights between Laverton and Ceylon, Singapore and Christchurch via various air bases in Australia. These exercises were used to establish fuel consumption rates and practice the refuelling and navigation practices {{that would be used}} in the race. As part of this training the flight broke many Australian and New Zealand air speed records, setting the fastest time for crossing the Tasman Sea during a flight between RAAF Base Amberley and Christchurch on 16August. An <b>aeronautical</b> <b>engineer</b> was attached to No.1 Long Range Flight from the Department of Air to calculate the optimum route for the Canberras to take. On 2September Cuming and Raw visited the Government Aircraft Factories facility at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne to thank the workers who were building Canberra bombers for the RAAF.|$|E
