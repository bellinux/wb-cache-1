Unblocking of B occurred if the AB compound signaled {{an increase in}} unconditioned stimulus (US) intensity or number.

Such assessments during unblocking revealed that more was learned about B than A following an increase in US intensity but not US number.

The results of both experiments, while controlling for the possible contribution of associations between these hidden units (within-layer links), provide evidence that the distribution of <b>associative</b> <b>change</b> between units in the hidden layer that are activated by the stimulus compound and those in the output layer (between-layer links) are unequal.

40|$|The present thesis {{examined}} the behavioural and brain mechanisms of <b>associative</b> <b>change</b> in the rat during Pavlovian fear conditioning {{as measured by}} freezing. The first series of experiments (Chapter 3) used compound test designs to study how learning is distributed among excitatory and neutral conditional stimuli (CSs). More was learned about a neutral CSB than an excitatory CSA when trained in isolation, indicating that fear learning is negatively accelerated. CSA blocked fear learning to CSB when trained in compound. Unblocking of CSB occurred if the AB compound signalled an increase in unconditional stimulus (US) intensity or number. Assessments of <b>associative</b> <b>change</b> during blocking showed that more was learned about CSB than CSA. Such assessments during unblocking revealed that more was learned about CSB than CSA following an increase in US intensity but not US number. These US manipulations had no differential effects on single-cue learning. The results show that variations in US intensity or number produce unblocking of fear learning, but for each there is a different profile of <b>associative</b> <b>change</b> and a potentially different mechanism. The second series of experiments (Chapter 4) demonstrated that these stimulus selection effects are mediated, at least in part, by nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh). AcbSh lesions augmented overshadowing during compound conditioning and promoted learning about CSA {{at the expense of}} CSB during blocking designs. Lesioned rats could learn normally about the novel CSB if it was rendered more informative regarding shock in Stage II. These results identify an important role for AcbSh and ventral striatum in distributing attention and learning among competing predictors of danger...|$|E

40|$|Studies in {{laboratory}} animals {{have shown that}} the extinction of a conditioned stimulus, A, is regulated by the associative history of a second stimulus, X, when the two are extinguished in simultaneous compound: An inhibitory X protects A from extinction (Rescorla Learning & Behavior, 31, 124 - 132, 2003), whereas an excitatory X facilitates, and under some circumstances deepens, the extinction of A (Rescorla Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes, 26, 251 - 260, 2000, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes, 32, 135 - 144, 2006). In the present study, we used the allergist task to examine whether the extinction of causal judgments in people is similarly regulated by the causal status of co-present stimuli. Experiment 1 showed that a cue trained as a conditioned inhibitor protected a target cue from extinction: The target extinguished in compound with the inhibitor was rated as being more causal of the outcome than was a target extinguished in compound with a control cue lacking inhibitory properties. In contrast, the remaining experiments showed that the extinction of a target cue was regulated by the presence, but not the causal status, of a partner cue: Target cues extinguished in compound were protected from extinction, and no evidence showed that an already extinguished partner conferred more protection (Exp. 2), or that an excitatory partner conferred any less protection (Exps. 2 and 3), or that an excitatory partner deepened the extinction of its already extinguished target.

40|$|Hormones play {{a pivotal}} role in {{reproductive}} behavior and have been implicated in mediating mate choice decisions. Here we asked whether the differences in female reproductive state dependent on changes in hormone levels correspond to changes in female affiliation with males. In the African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, males shift between reproductive (territorial; T) and non-reproductive (non-territorial; NT) states depending on social context while females alternate between gravid (egg bearing; G) and non-gravid (NG) reproductive states independent of social conditions. Moreover, the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis controlling reproduction and reproductive hormones is substantially remodeled in both males and females depending on reproductive state. To measure affiliative preference, gravid and non-gravid females were given the choice of associating with T or NT males. Gravid females preferentially associated with T males, whereas non-gravid females showed no preference. To discover whether gravid females use male size independent of dominance status as a cue for their choice, gravid females were given a choice between territorial males of different sizes. Gravid females preferred the smaller of two T males, but the smaller T males were significantly more active. Our results show that <b>associative</b> <b>change</b> could be an important behavioral mediator between hormonal cues and reproductive success, and that females use a hierarchy of cues in decision-making, preferring to affiliate with T over NT males and, among T males, preferring more active animals.

40|$|Synapsin is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved, presynaptic vesicular phosphoprotein. Here, we {{ask where}} and how synapsin functions in associative behavioral plasticity. Upon loss or reduction of synapsin in a deletion mutant or via RNAi, respectively, Drosophila larvae are impaired in odor-sugar associative learning. Acute global expression of synapsin and local expression in only the mushroom body, a third-order "cortical" brain region, fully restores associative ability in the mutant. No rescue is found by synapsin expression in mushroom body input neurons or by expression excluding the mushroom bodies. On the molecular level, we find that a transgenically expressed synapsin with dysfunctional PKA-consensus sites cannot rescue the defect of the mutant in associative function, thus assigning synapsin as a behaviorally relevant effector of the AC-cAMP-PKA cascade. We therefore suggest that synapsin acts in associative memory trace formation in the mushroom bodies, as a downstream element of AC-cAMP-PKA signaling.

Extracellular potentials evoked in the dentate gyrus by test pulses to the perforant path were recorded before and at various delays {{after a series of}} high-frequency stimulus trains to the perforant path (ten trains of eight pulses at 400 Hz, delivered at 5 min intervals). We have compared the magnitude and duration of l. t. p. of the population spike in this control condition with that observed when a low-intensity m. r. f. stimulation was delivered 10 s after each train to the perforant path. Post-event m. r. f. stimulation enhanced the amount of l. t. p. induced by the series of high-frequency stimulus trains and prolonged its duration for several days. The size of the population spike was unaffected by repeated m. r. f. stimulation in the absence of perforant path high-frequency stimulation, or when this failed to induce significant l. t. p. The temporal gradient of efficacy of m. r. f. stimulation was investigated. M. r. f. stimulation delivered 10 s after a single high-frequency stimulation of perforant path fibres resulted in an enhanced l. t. p. of both the population excitatory post-synaptic potential (e. p. s. p.) and population spike. L. t. p. was unaffected by m. r. f. stimulation given either before, or 120 s after perforant path high-frequency stimulation. These results show that low-intensity m. r. f. stimulation enhances lasting changes in synaptic function in the dentate gyrus when delivered during a critical period following high-frequency activation of perforant path fibres. These results are discussed in the light of our previous findings on the effects of post-event m. r. f. stimulation on memory and on the development of <b>associative</b> <b>changes</b> in hippocampal multiunit activity during conditioning.

To study how hippocampal neurons convey information about reward and trial outcome during new associative learning, we recorded hippocampal neurons as monkeys learned novel object-place associations. A large population of hippocampal neurons (50 %) signaled trial outcome by differentiating between correct and error trials {{during the period}} after the behavioral response. About half these cells increased their activity following correct trials (correct up cells) while the remaining half fired more following error trials (error up cells). Moreover, correct up cells, but not error up cells, conveyed information about learning by increasing their stimulus-selective response properties with behavioral learning.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{associative}} polymers {{on the structure}} and rheological behavior of colloidal suspensions is discussed. Adding associative polymer is known to increase the viscosity of the suspensions. At high shear rates the increase is close to what could be expected {{on the basis of}} the hydrodynamic effects of the added polymer. At low shear rates the viscosity increases much more. Small-angle light scattering (SALS) during flow is used here to investigate the underlying structural mechanisms. The SALS patterns indicate that the <b>associative</b> polymer <b>changes</b> the particulate structure: characteristic butterfly patterns appear even at relatively low particle volume fractions. They are not present in the suspensions without associative polymer. The patterns indicate that fluctuations in particle concentration are more pronounced in the flow direction than in the vorticity direction and that anisotropic particulate structures with an orientation along the vorticity direction develop. The evolution of their characteristic length scale during how has been followed over time. Changing the hydrophilic part of the polymer from polyacrylamide to polyacrylic acid induces stronger associative interactions. In the suspensions this results in a reduction of the relative viscosity rather than an increase, The difference in degree of associativity between the polymers also has an effect on the SALS patterns in the suspensions both at rest and during flow. The rheology as well as the SALS suggest the presence of a strong polymer network in the second system. The competition between adsorption of the associative polymer on the particles with the intermolecular associations between the polymer chains seems to be responsible for the observed differences.

Though some people think ethics cannot be effectively taught in college curricula because of a belief that ethics are formed by one’s upbringing, family and social influences, this study shows that ethical perceptions, as meas-ured in <b>associative</b> networks, can <b>change</b> after presenting information and having instructor-led discussion of ethical issues. Pathfinder analysis used in this study generates an associative or cognitive network for individuals and for group averages. These associative networks can be used to measure changes before and after presentation of information and group discus-sions of ethical issues. The results of this study show that people’s perceptions of ethical is-sues do change on average. It {{remains to be seen whether}} a <b>change</b> in one’s <b>associative</b> net-work persists over time or whether it could lead to changes in behavior. Beyond assessment of <b>changes</b> in <b>associative</b> networks and the impact of education, there is a brief discussion of how Pathfinder analyses might also be used by instructors to plan individualized education...|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleophilic}} and solvolytic {{path for}} the chloride anation reaction of aqua(diethylenetriamine) platinum (II) is computationally investigated at the Hartee-Fock (HF) and Density functional theory (B 3 LYP and mPW 1 PW 91) of levels of calculation in gas phase {{and on the}} self- consistent reaction field (SCRF) model. All the stationary points are fully optimized and characterized. The kinetic and thermodynamic properties of all the species involved are investigated and compared with the available experimental data. The transition state is described by local reactivity descriptors. A point of inflection of Fukui function and local softness of the incoming nucleophile for both the solvolytic and nucleophilic path at the transition state (Saddle point), corresponds to both bond breaking and bond making processes. The existence of the solvolytic path (k 1) along with nucleophilic path (k 2) has been supported by DFT studies. From the enthalpy of activation (H≠), entropy of activation (S≠) and the structures of the transition states, an inter <b>change</b> <b>associative</b> mechanism (Ia) is established for both nucleophilic and solvolytic path for the chloride anation reactio...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore {{to what extent the}} memory {{difficulties}} in older adults are a result of problems with memory control and the role played by associative memory in age-related changes. This project explored participants’ ability to encode and retrieve sets of word pairs, and the effect of word relatedness on their performance. This was in order to understand better how the automatic and controlled influences on <b>associative</b> memory <b>change</b> in aging. In order to answer these questions, younger and older adults were compared, focusing particularly on associative memory tasks. Comparisons were drawn between older and younger adults’ item and associative memory using word pair recognition tasks and the additional variable of word pair relatedness. Participants were drawn from two age groups with younger adults’ ages ranging from 18 to 33 and older adults’ from 60 to 75. There were two phases, an encoding phase followed by a retrieval phase, to each test. Participants were presented with word pairs in the encoding phase and given an opportunity to encode the information by rating the perceived association between the two words. The retrieval phase either involved pair recognition (determining whether the whole word pair was presented in the same combination as at encoding) or item recognition (determining whether the second word in the pair appeared in the encoding phase). The main results of this study show an overall memory deficit and decrement in performance with age with an improvement with relatedness in both age groups. There was a higher number of false alarms for the rearranged condition in older adults in the pair task, along with a lower number of hits for old word pairs, suggesting diminished ability to distinguish between old and recombined pairs, demonstrating an associative deficit in the pair task. These findings suggest further evidence for the importance of support (relatedness) in age-related memory decline...|$|R
40|$|Comparing {{data from}} {{different}} subfields of research may help in understanding emerging patterns and refining interpretations. This {{is especially true}} in neuroscience because brain functions can be studied at multiple levels of analysis, spatially and temporally, and with a variety of complementary measurement techniques. Within the ERP domain, several subfields of research have evolved over time, typically reflecting the specific time-window of interest and brain function investigated. The current investigation focused on three widely studied ERP effects reflecting a variety of key brain functions: the N 400 effect, the P 3 b effect and the Left Parietal effect. The N 400 effect has attracted researchers interested in language processing, the P 3 b effect researchers interested in attentional processes and the Left Parietal effect researchers focused on episodic recollection. Even though the ERP technology constitutes a common thread across these subfields, there is often a lack of communication across groups of researchers. The literatures on the N 400 effect, P 3 b effect and Left Parietal effect have been written by relatively non-overlapping groups of researchers, and as such the kind of analysis carried out in the current thesis is not a common one, as it compares effects investigated within different subfields. Specifically, the approach taken in the current thesis involves assessment of the comparative reliability of the three effects of interest, {{and at the same time}} allowing refining their validity. Results showed that all three effects were found to be reliable at the group level and the N 400 effect and the P 3 b effect were also found to be reliable at the single participant level. A correlational analysis involving all three effects yielded a significant correlation between the P 3 b and the Left Parietal effect but not between the P 3 b and the N 400, or between the Left Parietal effect and the N 400. Following up on the significant correlation, suggesting a convergence between the P 3 b effect and the Left Parietal effect, a probability manipulation of the Left Parietal effect was carried out to investigate if the old/new effect is sensitive to probability changes similarly to the P 3 b. The size of the Left Parietal effect was found to be sensitive to the relative probability of old and new items, in a manner consistent with the P 3 b effect‟s sensitivity to probability manipulations. The results pointing to a relationship between the P 3 b effect and the Left Parietal effect suggest that attentional processes sensitive to probability may temporally overlap and confound memory processes as indexed by the Left Parietal effect. The N 400 effect, in the initial correlational study, was found to be independent from attentional processes as reflected by the P 3 b, and from episodic recollection as indexed by the Left Parietal effect. The validity of the N 400 effect as a measure of semantic processing was then assessed by manipulating associative relationships while keeping constant semantic relationships, with results showing that the effect can be clearly modulated by <b>associative</b> <b>changes</b> when semantic relatedness is kept constant. The same association norms were then used in an old/new recognition experiment to assess if the Bilateral-Frontal old/new effect behaves in reaction to association relationships similarly or differently from the N 400, in the attempt of assessing if the N 400 is only a measure of associative relationships or also a measure of the process of familiarity. The observed pattern suggests independence between the N 400 and the Bilateral Frontal effect. Overall, the N 400 effect was found to be independent from memory processes occurring in the same time window, but, contrary to the dominant interpretation of the effect, the effect was modulated by changes in association strength while keeping semantic relatedness constant, suggesting that the N 400 effect may be sensitive to a contiguity-based associative learning process not constrained to the linguistic domain...|$|R
