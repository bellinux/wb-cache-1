5|$|Australia {{were now}} 02 down {{and needed to}} win three Tests in a row to retain the <b>Ashes.</b> The {{pressure}} on McCabe increased when last-minute injuries meant {{that he had to}} open the bowling. McCabe made 63 and 22 and took a wicket as Australia won their first match in the series.

In the deciding Test at the MCG, McCabe scored 112, one of three centuries as Australia amassed 604, a record score in <b>Ashes</b> Tests in Australia. This laid the platform for the innings victory that retained the <b>Ashes.</b> McCabe aggregated 491 runs in five Tests at 54.55, with a century and five fifties in a consistent display.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} the utilization of fly <b>ash</b> and bottom <b>ash</b> to improve the sugbrades material in highway construction. The research conducts various contents of fly <b>ash</b> and bottom <b>ash</b> to different types of clay soils from various sites in Kuantan. The compaction tests and California Bearing Ratio (CBR) tests were applied in soil samples to estimate the optimum mixture design. The samples were set up by mixing soil samples with various content of fly <b>ash</b> and bottom <b>ash</b> at different water content in compaction test to obtain optimum dry unit weight and optimum water contents.

Some species of biomass <b>ash</b> have low <b>ash</b> melting temperature and can cause various problems in combustion boilers. <b>Ash</b> slags and sinters can avoid heat transfer in heat exchangers, which can cause corrosion of heat transfer surfaces. <b>Ash</b> melting temperature can be determined on the basis of standard STN ISO 540 in some laboratory.

Although there have been investigations into the properties of separated single types of <b>ash,</b> the studies of the fly/bottom <b>ash</b> mixtures, especially with high fly <b>ash</b> contents, are very limited. Representative samples of class F fly <b>ash</b> and bottom <b>ash</b> were collected from two utility plants in Indiana and a series of extensive laboratory tests were conducted to obtain the mechanical properties of the mixture.
