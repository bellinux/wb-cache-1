50|$|In {{the early}} pioneer days, industrious Chinese launderers <b>and</b> <b>cooks</b> spent <b>time</b> {{gardening}} in the defile of the Gulch. Few of these immigrants ever acquired rights to own {{land in the}} Gulch and their gardens were gradually displaced by Italians and other European working families who terraced their properties into level plots. Despite the steep terrain, these immigrant families planted vegetable gardens reminiscent of the old country, fed by plenty of water from Trail Creek and the hot summer sun.|$|R
50|$|In Persian {{language}} sources, al-Zamakhshari {{mentioned the}} name of this food in the 11th century in the form tarkhana in his dictionary; it is attested in the 13th century in the form tarkhina in the Jahangiri Encyclopedia (named after Jahangir, the Mughal emperor of India). Tar تر in Persian means 'wet, soaked', and khwān خوان (pronounced khān) means 'dining place/table, food, large wooden bowl'. Thus in Persian it would mean 'watered or soaked food', which matches the way the soup is made: tarhana must be soaked in water, and other possible ingredients are then added <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> for some <b>time.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{consumption of}} soybeans {{due to its}} bioactive compounds has attracted interest in describing the grain's constituents and variation during processing. Phytate has been the aim of much research since it chelates essential minerals but also has beneficial antioxidant effects. This study evaluated the variation of phytate, calcium, zinc, and iron during soaking and cooking of soybeans. The phytate: Zn and phytate: Fe molar ratios were determined in order to estimate the bioavailability of these minerals. Six food-type varieties were used: BR 36, BRS 213, BRS 216, BRS 232, BRS 155, and Embrapa 48. The samples were soaked in water 3 : 1 (w/w) for 12 hours at room temperature <b>and</b> <b>cooked.</b> Cooking <b>time</b> was determined by modeling the softening of each variety using fractional conversion. Water content, phytate, and minerals were determined in raw, soaked <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> samples. The water content of raw grains for all varieties was 9. 9 g. 100 g- 1 increasing {{to a range of}} 58. 1 - 63. 7 g. 100 g- 1 after soaking and 63. 1 - 66. 0 g. 100 g- 1 after cooking. Soaking caused a significant reduction in phytate (23 - 30 %), but cooking caused no additional reduction. The phytate: Zn molar ratio was 20 indicating that zinc absorption could be impaired, while the phytate: Fe molar ratio was 8, below the level of compromising absorptio...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Maori chiefship, based on {{historical}} evidence. Very soon after the discovery of New Zealand by Cook in 1769 the Maori began to change and the traditional way of life was left behind. At {{the same time the}} Maori are one of the world's most documented people. In the accounts of the early explorers, missionaries, traders, <b>and</b> settlers, from <b>Cook's</b> <b>time</b> onwards there is a wealth of ethnographic material. the accounts were taken up by surveyors, native agents, and Maoris themselves either deliberately recording the passing way of life, or indirectly revealing many of its features while giving evidence in the land courts. Throughout the period we have the observations of amateur ethnographers as Colenso, Maning, White, Gudgeon, Tregear, Downes and others. The era of such observers culminated in the works of Elsdon Best. [Abstract continued in thesis]</p...|$|R
40|$|Aid Africa?s Six-Bricks Rocket Stoves {{facilitates}} to {{the many}} needs of its users in the Internally Displaced Persons camps of Northern Uganda. When properly manufactured and operated, the Six-Bricks Rocket Stove is advertised to be fifty percent more efficient, emit one-quarter the amount of smoke, <b>and</b> <b>cook</b> two <b>times</b> faster than the traditional Ugandan open-flamed wood stove. Not only does the lack of smoke significantly lower its user?s risk of cataracts, lung cancer, and asthma, the decreased quantity of fuel required consequently removes them from the vulnerable position of wood gathering. Unfortunately, because Northern Uganda is void of most Western technologies and lacks a technical sector, as any region plagued by a civil war spanning {{the past three decades}} would, stoves are currently being produced incorrectly and under their potential efficiency while users operate their stoves incorrectly. Brick production is much higher than stove production would infer but because many of the bricks are so poorly managed and made, they deteriorate and are physically unusable. Because of the Six Bricks Rocket Stove?s potential to increase {{the quality of life for}} the many historically neglected peoples of Northern Uganda, I have researched and implemented efficient stove manufacturing and use in the Gulu region of Uganda, providing demonstrations, reteachings and infrastructural upgrades for brick makers and users alike...|$|R

40|$|Background—Small {{observational}} {{studies have}} found that isolated right heart failure (IRHF) is prevalent among women of sub-Saharan Africa. Further, several risk factors for the development of IRHF have been identified. However, no similar studies have been conducted in Kenya. Objective—We hypothesized that specific environmental exposures and comorbidities were associated with IRHF in women of western Kenya. Methods—We conducted a case-control study at a referral hospital in western Kenya. Cases were defined as women at least 35 years old with IRHF. Control subjects were similarly aged volunteers without IRHF. Exclusion criteria in both groups included history of tobacco use, tuberculosis, or thromboembolic disease. Participants underwent echocardiography, spirometry, 6 -min walk test, rest/exercise oximetry, respiratory health interviews, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing.
