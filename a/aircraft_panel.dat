40|$|Structural members, such as, {{stiffeners}} {{are applied}} to aeronautical structures {{in order to promote}} the necessary global or local dynamic stiffness. The manufacture and assembly process of these parts and machines capability can introduce variability in the parts and thereby incorporating uncertainties in the structural performance. Tolerances known as GD&T (Geometrical dimensioning and Tolerance), must be specified for several dimensions during the engineering design, in order to enable the manufacture of the structure. In the same way, some material properties have variability, when different suppliers are involved. Thus, the uncertainties must be incorporated into the structural analysis in order to obtain a more reliable design. Therefore, the present thesis applies the SFEM to incorporate these uncertainties in a typical structural member and panel applied in the aeronautical industry. The approach used was Perturbation Technique using Taylor series expansions to incorporate the uncertainties in the structural members typically used in aircraft. Natural frequencies, frequency response functions and modal analysis are studied {{in order to understand the}} consequences of these uncertainties in a beam with hat and "Z" section normally applied as an <b>aircraft</b> <b>panel</b> stiffener. The stiffeners were modeled considering the Timoshenko Theory in Matlab software. Sensitivity analyses were applied for the correct interpretations and trends of the top contributors. Also an <b>aircraft</b> <b>panel</b> was performed using Nastran and Matlab software together to incorporate these uncertainties on the modal analysis. Final conclusions and issues of implementation and applicability are performed using MCS as a validation model for the stiffeners and the total range variation for the <b>aircraft</b> <b>panel...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{automatically}} {{obtain a}} machining area in numerical control (NC) programming, a data model of generalized pocket is established by analyzing <b>aircraft</b> integral <b>panel</b> characteristics, and a feature recognition approach is proposed. First, {{by reference to}} the practical slice-machining process of an <b>aircraft</b> integral <b>panel,</b> both the part and the blank are sliced in the Z-axis direction; hence a feature profile is created according to the slicing planes and the contours are formed by {{the intersection of the}} slicing planes with the part and its blank. Second, the auxiliary features of the generalized pocket are also determined based on the face type and the position, to correct the profile of the pocket. Finally, the generalized pocket feature relationship tree is constructed by matching the vertical relationships among the features. Machining feature information produced by using this method can be directly used to calculate the cutter path. The validity and practicability of the method is verified by NC programming for <b>aircraft</b> <b>panels...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study investigates a {{possibility}} for representing, interpreting and visualising the vibration response of <b>aircraft</b> <b>panels</b> using time domain measurements. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>panels</b> are modelled as thin orthotropic plates and their vibration response is simulated using FE modelling. The vibration response of a thin aluminium panel is simulated using FE modelling. The first ten resonant frequencies are estimated for the FE model and for the dynamically tested panel. They were found to show somewhat low sensitivity to damage. Then the simulated vibration response of the panel is transformed and expanded in a new phase space. This presents an alternative way to study and analyse the dynamics of a structure. A two dimensional phase space is used in this investigation. Thus instead of studying the single dimension measured vibration characteristics one is faced with expanded two dimensional variables which can be visualised and this facilitates the comparison between the damaged and the non-damage states...|$|R

40|$|Sandwich {{structures}} {{have been}} widely used for many years in applications such as <b>aircraft</b> <b>panels,</b> marine-craft hulls, racing car bodies and spacecraft solar arrays. Most sandwich panel designs include a lightweight core such as paper honeycomb or closed cell foam encased between two face plates, {{and in the case of}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>panels</b> constructed from carbon fibre reinforced plastics, the core is bevelled and edge pan plies are included to totally enclose the core. This type of design restricts access to the core making it almost impossible for the engineer to measure the shear strain developed in the core during in-service static or dynamic loading. This paper introduces a new measurement technique whereby the shear strain in the core can be estimated from face plate measurements using a linear finite difference approximation. The estimation method is presented and supported by calculations on a statically loaded sandwich beam. Static and dynamic experiments were conducted in order to validate the technique using a honeycomb sandwich beam instrumented with strain gauges on the core and face plates. The results showed excellent agreement between measured and estimated core shear strain for sandwich configurations with thin face plates, such as those encountered in aircraft and marine-craft constructions...|$|R

The laminar boundary layer at {{the leading edge of the}} plate reacts to small, upstream, unsteady disturbances due to a streamwise pressure gradient. The experiments demonstrate that a nominal sound pressure incident at the leading edge triggers early transition. It is shown that transition can be delayed by activating a heat source at the leading edge of the plate which results in downstream cooling...|$|E
