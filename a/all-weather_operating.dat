25|$|In March 2011, it was {{projected}} that the fleet of 32 U-2s would be operated until 2015. In 2014, Lockheed Martin {{determined that the}} U-2S fleet has used only one-fifth of its design service life {{and is one of}} the youngest fleets within the USAF. In 2011 the USAF intended to replace the U-2 with the RQ-4 before fiscal year 2015; proposed legislation required any replacement to have lower operating costs. In January 2012 the USAF reportedly planned to end the RQ-4 Block 30 program and extend the U-2's service life until 2023. The RQ-4 Block 30 was kept in service due to political pressure over USAF objections, who state that the U-2 costs $2,380 per flight hour compared to the RQ-4's $6,710 as of early 2014. Critics have pointed out that the RQ-4's cameras and sensors are less capable, and a lack of <b>all-weather</b> <b>operating</b> capability; however, some of the U-2's sensors may be installed on the RQ-4. The RQ-4 Block 30's capabilities were planned to match the U-2's by FY 2016, the replacement effort is motivated by decreases in the RQ-4's cost per flying hour.|$|E
40|$|Significant {{sources of}} {{uncertainty}} in global trace gas budgets {{are due to}} lack of knowledge concerning the areal and temporal extent of source and sink areas. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is particularly suited to studies of northern ecosystems because of its <b>all-weather</b> <b>operating</b> capability which enables the acquisition of seasonal data. As key controls on methane exchange, the ability to differentiate major vegetation communities, inundation, and leaf area index (LAI) with satellite and airborne SAR data would increase the accuracy and precision of regional and seasonal estimates of methane exchange. The utility of SAR data for monitoring key controls on methane emissions from Arctic and boreal ecosystems is examined...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) has a day-and-night and <b>all-weather</b> <b>operating</b> capability, {{can acquire}} high-resolution images of large areas within short time frames and can measure {{the speed of}} moving objects. That is why its application to ground moving target indication (GMTI) and to traffic monitoring has been intensively investigated in the recent years. The German SAR satellite TerraSAR-X, {{which is scheduled to}} be launched later in 2006, will provide various SAR imaging modes with resolutions down to 1 m. It will additionally allow for different operating modes for along-track interferometry (ATI) which is sensitive to across-track motions of moving objects. This paper introduces a first approach for the concept of a traffic information extraction processor for TerraSAR-X data...|$|E
2500|$|The 325th Fighter Group (<b>All-Weather)</b> <b>operated</b> two squadrons of F-82F Twin Mustangs from McChord between 1948 and 1950, {{the first}} postwar fighter {{optimized}} {{for the air}} defense interceptor mission. [...] Designed for very-long range bomber escort missions in the Pacific during World War II, the design became operational too late to see service and was adapted for the air defense mission.|$|R
50|$|Mersey class {{lifeboats}} are <b>all-weather</b> lifeboats <b>operated</b> by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) from {{stations around}} the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland. They are capable of operating at up to 17 kn and can be launched from a carriage.|$|R
25|$|Nine B.2s {{converted}} to trainers for pilots and navigators of <b>all-weather</b> interceptors to <b>operate</b> the Airborne Intercept radar, crew of four.|$|R
50|$|The Trent-class {{lifeboat}} is an <b>all-weather</b> lifeboat <b>operated</b> by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) from 30 {{stations around}} the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland to provide coverage up to 50 mi out to sea. Introduced to service in 1994, the class is named after the River Trent, the second longest river wholly in England.|$|R
2500|$|Tamar-class {{lifeboats}} are <b>all-weather</b> lifeboats (ALBs) <b>operated</b> by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) {{around the}} coasts of Great Britain [...] and Ireland. They have replaced {{the majority of the}} older [...] ALBs. The prototype was built in 2000 and 27 production boats were introduced between 2006 and 2013.|$|R
5000|$|Lydd Airport, {{opened in}} 1954, {{was the first}} airport {{to be built in}} the UK {{following}} the end of the Second World War. It was built for Silver City Airways as an <b>all-weather</b> replacement <b>operating</b> base to that of nearby Lympne Airport, whose grass runway was often waterlogged in rainy weather. The new Lydd Ferryfield was, like Lympne, used initially for car carrying air ferry services using Bristol Freighters, operating principally to Le Touquet in France. Within 5 years of opening, it was handling over 250,000 passengers annually, {{making it one of the}} busiest airports in the UK.|$|R
5000|$|Shoreham Harbour Lifeboat Station is an RNLI station {{located in}} the town of Shoreham-by-Sea in the English county of West Sussex in the United Kingdom. It {{underwent}} extensive re-development in 2010 with a new purpose built boathall to accommodate its new [...] <b>all-weather</b> lifeboat. It <b>operates</b> two lifeboats. The AWB lifeboat is called [...] and the Inshore lifeboat is a [...] called [...]|$|R
50|$|Typical of the NFB's {{series of}} short {{training}} films for the RCAF, Canada's Air Defence {{relied heavily on}} military assistance in obtaining footage. The film incorporated footage shot in 1956 at bases where No. 433 <b>All-Weather</b> (Fighter) Squadron <b>operated.</b> After the Second World War, the squadron, originally a heavy bomber squadron in Europe, reformed as a fighter squadron at Cold Lake, Alberta, on November 15, 1954. A move to North Bay, Ontario, came in October 1955, where the squadron flew CF-100 aircraft on North American air defence until being disbanded on August 1, 1961.|$|R
50|$|The McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo was an <b>all-weather</b> {{interceptor}} aircraft <b>operated</b> by the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Canadian Forces between 1961 and 1984. They were manufactured by the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation of St. Louis, Missouri for the United States Air Force (as F-101s), and later sold to Canada. CF-101s replaced the obsolete Avro CF-100 Canuck in the RCAF's all-weather fighter squadrons. The Voodoo's primary armament was nuclear AIR-2A Genie unguided air-to-air rockets, {{and there was}} significant political controversy in Canada about their adoption. Although they never fired a weapon in wartime, the CF-101 served as Canada's primary means of air defence from Quick Reaction Alert facilities at Canadian airbases. The CF-101s were retired in the 1980s and replaced with McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet fighters. Many examples are preserved in museums and parks in Canada and the United States.|$|R
