Hazard's shot was blocked in the 79th minute and Oscar then spurned <b>a</b> <b>chance,</b> <b>with</b> Falcao unable to create something from it. In {{an effort to find}} an equaliser with ten minutes of normal time remaining, Mourinho brought on Moses in place of Terry and deployed a three-man defence. It nearly presented Arsenal the chance to score their second of the match, but for Cazorla to have his effort blocked and Aaron Ramsey on the rebound shooting wide.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory against}} the British invasions brought forth great changes in the {{politics}} of Buenos Aires. The viceroy Sobremonte was discredited by his management of the conflict, and the Cabildo increased its influence; as such, it removed the viceroy and appointed Liniers as replacement, an unprecedented action. The local criollos, who had limited chances of social promotion in the system of castas, got such <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>with</b> the increased influence of the militias. Cornelio Saavedra, head of the biggest crioolo militia, thus became a highly influential man {{in the politics of}} Buenos Aires. He resented the weak support from the Spanish monarchy to the war effort, compared with the strong one received from the cabildos of other cities in the Americas. As a result, he was loyal to the new viceroy, of French ancestry, considering him to be less subject to the internal disputes of the House of Bourbon.|$|E

John Ward, who was also selected, was an experienced wicket-keeper who had toured England in 1958, but his batting was weak, and so Dick, who had kept wicket only once in first-class cricket, for Otago against the MCC in 1958–59, was given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>with</b> the gloves.|$|E

25|$|A short week two-game {{road trip}} {{concluded}} on a Friday in Chicago, where D.C. once again rescued {{a point in}} the final minutes. The game started brightly for the visitors, when they were awarded an indirect free kick just outside the Fire's 6-yard box. Rob Vincent scored his first MLS goal, with a blast through the defense, assisted by Acosta. However, the Fire responded quickly as Luke Mishu, playing for the injured Franklin, lost his mark on a corner kick and surrendered a header for goal. The Fire made it 2-0 not long thereafter, as David Accam dribbled around Birnbaum and took a long shot that found the corner of the goal. Down a goal, United turned in a tired display, and seemed destined for a defeat. As the game went into stoppage time, Mullins took <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>with</b> a spectacular overhead volley that rang off the crossbar. The rebound went to Nyarko, who forced a save by the diving Sean Johnson, but Boswell headed that rebound in for the tying goal. The draw again put United ahead of Orlando City Soccer Club {{in the race for the}} final playoff position, - but only on the goal differential tiebreaker with a big home match against Orlando City looming the following weekend. Both teams actually trailed New England Revolution in that race, by two points, but the Revolution had played an additional game.|$|E
