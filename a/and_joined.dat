The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in welding <b>and</b> <b>joining</b> of titanium aluminides, as well as to introduce current research and application. The possible methods available for titanium aluminides involve brazing, diffusion bonding, fusion welding, friction welding <b>and</b> reactive <b>joining.</b> Of the numerous methods, solid-state diffusion bonding and vacuum brazing have been most heavily investigated for producing reliable joints. The current state of understanding and development of every welding <b>and</b> <b>joining</b> method for titanium aluminides is addressed respectively. The focus is on the fundamental understanding of microstructure characteristics and processing–microstructure–property relationships in the welding <b>and</b> <b>joining</b> of titanium aluminides to themselves and to other materials...|$|R

Similarity search <b>and</b> similarity <b>join</b> are two important operations to address the poor data quality problem.

In this paper, we give a formal set-theoretic definition, which allows us to investigate and prove relationships between distances under various existing and new models. Among our results is that sorting in the HP model is equivalent to sorting in the reversal model when the initial and final genomes are linear uni-chromosomal. We also initiate the formal study of single-cut operations by giving a linear time algorithm for the distance problem under a new single-cut <b>and</b> <b>join</b> model.
