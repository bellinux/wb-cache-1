5|$|Concorde is an {{ogival delta}} winged {{aircraft}} with four Olympus engines {{based on those}} employed in the RAF's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber. It {{is one of the}} few commercial <b>aircraft</b> <b>to</b> employ a tailless design (the Tupolev Tu-144 being another). Concorde was the first airliner to have a (in this case, analogue) fly-by-wire flight-control system; the avionics system Concorde used was unique because it was the first commercial <b>aircraft</b> <b>to</b> employ hybrid circuits. The principal designer for the project was Pierre Satre, with Sir Archibald Russell as his deputy.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the end of}} {{the third}} and final air {{offensive}} over the Bay of Biscay, patrols continued until the liberation of France. The Bay of Biscay patrol statistics for the period 1 May to 2 August 1943, show Coastal Command had flown for 32,343 hours and lost 57 <b>aircraft</b> <b>to</b> all causes, sinking 28 U-boats and damaging 22. From 3 August 1943 to 31 May 1944, it flew 114,290 hours, losing 123 <b>aircraft</b> <b>to</b> all causes, and sinking 12 U-boats and damaging ten more.|$|E

5|$|However, Chase had {{designed}} the <b>aircraft</b> <b>to</b> {{allow for the}} easy installation of engines; the first XG-20 had already been modified with two radial piston engines, becoming the XC-123, the prototype of the long-serving C-123 Provider family of transports. Meanwhile, the second prototype XG-20 was returned to Chase <b>Aircraft,</b> <b>to</b> be fitted with two twin pods for General Electric J47 turbojets, becoming the XC-123A, the first jet-powered transport aircraft built in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{during the}} Second World War, Allied {{aircraft}} construction saw the UK of necessity concentrating on heavy bombers, leaving {{the production of}} transport <b>aircraft</b> <b>to</b> the USA. This would have left the UK with little experience in transport construction {{at the end of}} the war, so in 1943, a committee under Lord Brabazon of Tara investigated the future of the British civilian airliner market. The Brabazon Committee called for several different <b>aircraft</b> <b>to</b> be developed to specifications composed by the committee for roles felt to fulfil Britain's civilian aviation needs.|$|E

5|$|Initial plans {{called for}} the United States Air Force to {{dispatch}} two transport <b>aircraft</b> <b>to</b> Mogadishu International Airport, but diplomats were unable to contact anyone in the Somali government to obtain clearance for the <b>aircraft</b> <b>to</b> land {{at the airport and}} it also became clear that it was too dangerous to travel from the embassy to the airport. Meanwhile, the USS Guam and USS Trenton began transit from the coast of Oman towards Mogadishu with forces from the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade.|$|E

50|$|In Area Control Centers, a major weather {{problem is}} thunderstorms, which present {{a variety of}} hazards <b>to</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Aircraft will deviate around storms, {{reducing}} {{the capacity of the}} en-route system by requiring more space per aircraft, or causing congestion as many <b>aircraft</b> try <b>to</b> move through a single hole in a line of thunderstorms. Occasionally weather considerations cause delays <b>to</b> <b>aircraft</b> prior <b>to</b> their departure as routes are closed by thunderstorms.|$|R

5|$|Although the RF-4M {{would have}} had some advantages, it was {{discounted}} as the cost would have been greater, with consequently fewer aircraft purchased, while only those that had been modified {{would have been able}} to undertake the reconnaissance mission. Ultimately, the RAF chose the standard F-4M and external pod, which allowed all of its <b>aircraft</b> <b>to</b> perform all designated roles.|$|E
5|$|An FAA {{study in}} 1968 {{had found that}} {{a quarter of the}} 2,230 {{near-miss}} aircraft encounters reported that year had involved a military aircraft. Following the in-flight collision of Flight 706, the FAA and the US Military agreed to cut down on VFR flights and operate instead under IFR. This transition would require military <b>aircraft</b> <b>to</b> file flight plans and obey civilian air traffic controllers.|$|E
5|$|Based at RAF Scampton, it {{operates}} {{a fleet of}} 12 Mk 58 and three two-seaters (T.7 and T.8), {{as well as other}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>to</b> provide high speed aerial threat simulation, mission support training and trials support services.|$|E
