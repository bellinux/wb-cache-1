5|$|Some municipalities, {{particularly}} in South Jersey, <b>are</b> <b>dry</b> towns where no alcohol can be legally served or sold. Some of them <b>are</b> <b>dry</b> {{because of their}} origins as Quaker, Methodist, or other Protestant religious communities. For example, the seaside resort town of Ocean City has been dry since {{it was founded in}} 1879 by four Methodist clergymen. In recent years, several municipalities have questioned whether they ought to remain dry. Dry towns frequently have public referendums on whether they should remain dry or allow liquor sales in order to attract new businesses and increase property tax revenue.|$|E
5|$|It is Thanksgiving and Lisa assembles a {{decorative}} centerpiece for the dinner table. Meanwhile, Homer leaves {{to pick up}} Grampa from the retirement home once Patty and Selma arrive, bearing food (Swedish meatballs), and to Marge's consternation they insinuate that they find Marge's turkeys <b>are</b> <b>dry</b> and inedible. Their mother Jaqueline Bouvier arrives in a taxi, suffering from laryngitis, and tells Marge she never does anything right.|$|E

5|$|Average annual {{precipitation}} ranges from , {{though it is}} generally unpredictable. More than 85% of annual rainfall occurs from October to March, which constitutes the warm season. In contrast, the winter months <b>are</b> <b>dry.</b> Eastern and southeastern areas of the region receive more precipitation than the western areas since they receive more summer rainfall. Precipitation is highly variable {{from year to year}} and appears to follow a cycle between dry and wet years in periods of about 2, 4–5, 6–8, and 16–22 years. In wet years, easterly winds caused by the subtropical South Atlantic High are stronger, causing moisture to flow towards this region; during dry years, these winds are weaker.|$|E
5|$|The Wolds area {{takes the}} form of an elevated, gently rolling plateau, cut by {{numerous}} deep, steep-sided, flat-bottomed valleys of glacial origin. The chalk formation of the hills provides exceptionally good drainage, with the result that most of these valleys <b>are</b> <b>dry.</b> Surface water is quite scarce throughout the Wolds. At Flamborough Head the Wolds rise up to form high chalk cliffs, where there are water-worn caves and stacks along the shore. Flamborough Headland is designated a Heritage Coast. Coastal erosion around Flamborough Head has led to visitors being warned by the Humber Coastguard to be very careful on coastal paths.|$|E
5|$|The androecium {{consists}} of six stamens with filiform (thread like) filaments, which are fasciculate (in close bundles) and declinate or ascendent. The anthers are dorsifixed or versatile. In the gynaecium, the ovary is inferior and trilocular with pluriovulate locules. The style is filiform, and the stigma trifid. The fruit forms a trivalve capsule containing seeds which <b>are</b> <b>dry,</b> flattened, obliquely winged or irregularly discoid, hardly ever turgid, and globose (spherical) or subglobose, with a brown or black phytomelanous testa.|$|E
50|$|Acidic gases (e.g. {{hydrogen}} sulfide, hydrogen chloride, sulfur dioxide) can <b>be</b> <b>dried</b> with concentrated sulfuric acid, or with phosphorus pentoxide. Basic gases (e.g. ammonia) can <b>be</b> <b>dried</b> with calcium oxide, {{sodium hydroxide}} or soda lime.|$|R

60|$|His mouth <b>was</b> <b>dry.</b> It <b>was</b> <b>dry</b> {{with heavy}} sleep and {{extremely}} anxious thinking, {{as it had}} never <b>been</b> <b>dry</b> before. It may be said that Nostromo tasted the dust and ashes of the fruit of life into which he had bitten deeply in his hunger for praise. Without removing his head from between his fists, he tried to spit before him--"Tfui"--and muttered a curse upon the selfishness of all the rich people.|$|R
5|$|The {{fruit that}} {{develops}} is a schizocarp {{consisting of two}} mericarps; each mericarp is a true seed. The paired mericarps are easily separated when they <b>are</b> <b>dry.</b> Premature separation (shattering) before harvest is undesirable because it can result in seed loss. Mature seeds are flattened on the commissural side that faced the septum of the ovary. The flattened side has five longitudinal ribs. The bristly hairs that protrude from some ribs are usually removed by abrasion during milling and cleaning. Seeds also contain oil ducts and canals. Seeds vary somewhat in size, ranging from less than 500 to more than 1000 seeds per gram.|$|E
5|$|The fruits {{produced}} by cacti after the flowers have been fertilized vary considerably; many are fleshy, although some <b>are</b> <b>dry.</b> All contain {{a large number}} of seeds. Fleshy, colorful and sweet-tasting fruits are associated with seed dispersal by birds. The seeds pass through their digestive systems and are deposited in their droppings. Fruit that falls to the ground may be eaten by other animals; giant tortoises are reported to distribute Opuntia seeds in the Galápagos Islands. Ants appear to disperse the seeds of a few genera, such as Blossfeldia. Drier spiny fruits may cling to the fur of mammals or be moved around by the wind.|$|E
5|$|The polar easterlies, {{also known}} as Polar Hadley cells, <b>are</b> <b>dry,</b> cold {{prevailing}} winds that blow from the high-pressure areas of the polar highs at {{the north and south}} poles towards the low-pressure areas within the Westerlies at high latitudes. Unlike the Westerlies, these prevailing winds blow from the east to the west, and are often weak and irregular. Because of the low sun angle, cold air builds up and subsides at the pole creating surface high-pressure areas, forcing an equatorward outflow of air; that outflow is deflected westward by the Coriolis effect.|$|E
50|$|Foods <b>are</b> <b>dried</b> {{to inhibit}} {{microbial}} development and quality decay. However, {{the extent of}} drying depends on product end-use. Cereals and oilseeds <b>are</b> <b>dried</b> after harvest to the moisture content that allows microbial stability during storage. Vegetables <b>are</b> blanched before <b>drying</b> to avoid rapid darkening, and <b>drying</b> <b>is</b> not only carried out to inhibit microbial growth, but also to avoid browning during storage. Concerning dried fruits, the reduction of moisture acts in combination with its acid and sugar contents to provide protection against microbial growth. Products such as milk powder must <b>be</b> <b>dried</b> to very low moisture contents {{in order to ensure}} flowability and avoid caking. This moisture is lower than that required to ensure inhibition to microbial development. Other products as crackers <b>are</b> <b>dried</b> beyond the microbial growth threshold to confer a crispy texture, which is liked by consumers.|$|R

5|$|The {{western part}} of the {{district}} in the Vale of York borders on and is drained by the River Derwent. The landscape is generally low-lying and flat although minor ridges and glacial moraines provide some variations in topography. Where there <b>are</b> <b>dry</b> sandy soils there are remnants of historic heathlands and ancient semi-natural woodlands. Arable fields dominate the land cover of the area and grasslands are infrequent. There are very few flood meadows left, although some significant areas remain on the lower reaches of the River Derwent.|$|E
5|$|In the Prapancasarasara-samgraha, Dhumavati is {{described}} as having a black complexion and wearing ornaments made of snakes. Her dress is made of rags taken from cremation grounds. She holds a spear and a skull-cup (kapala) in her two hands. The spear is sometimes replaced by a sword. Another description in the same text says Dhumavati is aged with a wrinkled, angry face and cloud-like complexion. Her nose, eyes, and throat resemble a crow's. She holds a broom, a winnowing fan, a torch, and a club. She is cruel and frowning. Her hair appears dishevelled and she wears the simple clothes of a beggar. Her breasts <b>are</b> <b>dry.</b> Her hair is grey, her teeth crooked and missing, and her clothes old and worn.|$|E
5|$|This {{reaction}} is exothermic and releases enough heat to ignite the resulting hydrogen {{in the presence}} of oxygen, possibly explosively splashing onlookers with potassium hydroxide, which is a strong alkali that destroys living tissue and causes skin burns. Finely grated potassium ignites in air at room temperature. The bulk metal ignites in air if heated. Because its density is 0.89 g/cm3, burning potassium floats in water that exposes it to atmospheric oxygen. Many common fire extinguishing agents, including water, either are ineffective or make a potassium fire worse. Nitrogen, argon, sodium chloride (table salt), sodium carbonate (soda ash), and silicon dioxide (sand) are effective if they <b>are</b> <b>dry.</b> Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are also effective. These agents deprive the fire of oxygen and cool the potassium metal.|$|E
