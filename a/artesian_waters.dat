The {{problems}} and technological solutions {{have been considered}} for the demineralization and cleaning of the low-potential <b>artesian</b> <b>waters</b> of North Dagestan, promising for using in the systems of geothermal hot water supply and as a source of drinking water. The proposed method allows the problem of single-stage cleaning waters from arsenic compounds and humic acids. This method has been tested on Dagestan <b>artesian</b> <b>waters,</b> which contained arsenic in an amount significantly exceeding a standard value for such pollutant. Abstract. This study is aimed at decision of important socio-economic problems, such as heat and water supply to the population of the arid zones of Northern Dagestan based on complex use of low-potential geothermal waters’ reserves.  Arsenic compounds and humic acids {{was found in the}} most studied waters in amounts far exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) limiting rate for drinking water by spectral analysis methods (AAS, SPM). The sorbent based on DEAE-cellulose modified with Fe 3 + ions was prepared and tested by us for cleaning of the waters containing the arsenic compounds in an amount of more than 700 mcg/dm 3 and humic acids in an amount approximately equal to 200 mg/dm 3. This method has been successfully applied for the demineralization and cleaning of <b>artesian</b> <b>waters</b> in Kizlyarskiy, Tarumovskiy and Babayurtovskiy areas of Dagestan Republic to produce pure water complied with drinking water quality specification.  Further studies, in our opinion, should be carried out in two directions, namely, coverage of new adjacent territories to study the mineral composition and identification of pollutants of underground drinking water of the North Caucasus region of Russia, as well as the creation of new efficient methods of purification of artesian water with a wider range of their pollutants. </p...|$|E

40|$|Torbido Spring {{is located}} at the foot of Mount Sirino (Basilicata, Italy). From the bottom upwards the {{geological}} formations include: Flinty Limestones with high secondary permeability, forming the spring aquifer; Siliceous Schists consisting of radiolarites and multicoloured jaspers; and Galestrino Flysch, formed of argillites and marls. The Spring is singular in that the <b>artesian</b> <b>waters</b> from the limestones which are at a depth of 80 m here, come to the surface because of the marked fissuring of the Siliceous Schists. The headworks consist of a system of unpumped wells. The groundwaters are intercepted before they leak away in the detrital surface cover and before they lose their hydrostatic head (more than 4 bar above ground level). The maximum discharge which can be abstracted and handled by the wellfield and appurtenant works is around 300 l/s. This permits peak demand to be met without any waste of resources and guarantees the annual hydrologic balance between recharge and discharge.

40|$|The geochemical {{features}} of the volatiles dissolved in artesian thermal waters discharged over three basins (Millungera, Galilee and Cooper basin) of the Australian Great Artesian Basin (GAB) consistently indicate the presence of fluids from multiple gas sources located in the crust (e. g. sediments, oil reservoirs, granites) as well as minor but detectable contributions of mantle/magma-derived fluids. The gases extracted from 19 water samples and analyzed for their chemical and isotopic composition exhibit amounts of CO 2 up to about 340 mlSTP/LH 2 O marked by a δ 13 CTDC (Total Dissolved Carbon) ranging from − 16. 9 to + 0. 18 ‰ vs PDB, while CH 4 concentrations vary from 4. 4 × 10 − 5 to 4. 9 mlSTP/LH 2 O. Helium contents were between 9 and N 2800 times higher than equilibrium with Air Saturated Water (ASW), with a maximum value of 0. 12 mlSTP/LH 2 O. Helium isotopic composition was in the 0. 02 – 0. 21 Ra range (Ra = air-normalized 3 He/ 4 He ratio). The three investigated basins differ {{from each other in}} terms of both chemical composition and isotopic signatures of the dissolved gases whose origin is attributed to both mantle and crustal volatiles. Mantle He is present in the west-central and hottest part of the GAB despite no evidence of recent volcanism. Wefound that the partial pressure of helium, significantly higher in crustal fluids than in mantle-type volatiles, enhances the crustal He signature in the dissolved gases, thus masking the original mantle contribution. Neotectonic activity involving deep lithospheric structures and magma intrusions, highlighted by recent geophysical investigations, is considered to be the drivers of mantle/magmatic volatiles towards the surface. The results, although pertaining to <b>artesian</b> <b>waters</b> froma vast area of N 542, 000 km 2, provide newconstraints on volatile injection, and showthat fluids' geochemistry can provide additional and independent information on the geo-tectonic settings of the Great Artesian Basin and its geothermal potential...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the causes}} of lower {{artesian}} pressure, water waste and aquifer contamination is the misuse and insufficient care of artesian wells. In 1953, Senate Bill No. 57, entitled "An Act to Protect and Control the <b>Artesian</b> <b>Waters</b> of the State" (see Appendix) became a law. This law was passed through the efforts exerted by leading members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, who understood the need for a wise and controlled expenditure of our most valuable natural resource. The State Geologist and his authorized representatives were designated by this law to enforce this conservation measure; however, no financial provision was included for the 1953 - 55 biennium. The proposed program of the Florida Geological Survey for this biennium did not include the funds nor provide any full-time personnel for the enforcement of this statute. As a result, little actual work was accomplished during these two years, although much time was given to planning and discussion of the problem. Realizing that this program could provide additional basic data needed in the analysis of the water-supply problem, the State Geologist sought and was granted by the 1955 Legislature adequate funds with which to activate {{the first phase of the}} enforcement of Florida Statute No. 370. 051 - 054. Enumerated below is a summary of the progress made on this investigation as outlined previously: 1. Data have been collected on 967 wildly flowing wells in 22 counties. 2. Chloride determinations have been run on 850 of the 967 wells. 3. Of the 967 wells, 554 have chlorides in excess of the 250 ppm, the upper limit assigned by the State Board of Health for public consumption. 4. Water escapes at the rate of 37, 762 gallons per minute from these 967 wells. This amounts to 54, 377, 280 gallons per day. The investigation is incomplete at this time; therefore, no final conclusions can be reached. However, from data already collected, the following recommendations are proposed: 1. That the present inventory of wildly flowing wells be completed for the entire State. 2. That the current inventory of wildly flowing wells be expanded at the conclusion of the present inventory to include all flowing wells. 3. That a complete statewide inventory program be established and conducted in cooperation with the Ground Water Branchof the U. S. Geological Survey. 4. That the enforcement functions as set down in Sections 370. 051 /. 054, Florida Statutes, be separated from the program to collect water-resource data and that these functions be given to the Water Resources Department, if such is created (to be recommended by the Water Resources Study Commission in a water policy law presented to the 1957 Legislature). 5. That the research phase (well inventory) of the program remain under the direction of the Florida Geological Survey. (PDF contains 204 pages. ...|$|E
40|$|The arid inland of Australia {{contains}} {{a diversity of}} landscapes and landscape processes, often of great antiquity, extending back to the Mesozoic and Paleozoic. The potential of this landscape {{as a source of}} Mars analogs has, however, been little explored. The few examples studied so far include radiation-tolerant microbes in thermal springs and hematite-silica hydrothermal alteration near Arkaroola in the Finders Ranges, and aeolian landforms at Gurra Gurra water hole the north east of Arkaroola. Further Australian Mars analog studies were provided by the studies of Bourke and Zimbelman of the paleoflood record of the Todd and Hale Rivers in central Australia. To facilitate study of such analogues, Mars Society Australia has embarked on a project to construct a Mars Analog Research Station near Arkaroola. The international scientific community will soon have the opportunity to participate in Mars analog studies in central Australia utilizing this facility. An area of considerable Mars analog potential is the mound spring complexes that occur at the margins of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) which underlies 22 % of the Australian continent and covers 1. 7 million km 2. The mound springs are formed when ground water flows to a topographic low, and subsurface strata dips up causing a hydrological head at the surface. Minerals precipitated at the spring discharge zone form low mesas or "mounds", the height of which are controlled by the hydrological head. This paper describes the Dalhousie Mound Spring Complex (DMC) {{in the northern part of}} South Australia (Figure 1), and its potential as a Mars analog. Hydrogeology: The DMC consists of a cluster of more than 60 active springs formed by natural discharge from the GAB). Total measured discharge from the GAB is 1. 74 GL per day, estimated unfocussed natural leakage through the aquaclude is thought be approximately equal to this figure. Some 54 ML per day are currently discharged by the DMC, 3 % of the measured total. The discharged <b>artesian</b> <b>waters</b> are of low to moderate salinity (700 - 9400 ppm), near neutral pH (6. 8 - 7. 3) and warm (20 - 46 C). The elevated temperatures are due to passage of the groundwater through deeply buried (up to 3 km) aquifers in an region of high heat flow, rather than magmatic heating. The waters also contain high levels of dissolved iron and H 2 S and less than 1 ppm dissolved oxygen. The water is carried in the Late Jurassic Algebuckina Sandstone beneath the aquaclude of the Bulldog Shale. It is brought near the surface by the mid-Cenozoic Dalhousie anticline and the ground water flow focused along a series of faults that breach the anticline's crest...|$|E
