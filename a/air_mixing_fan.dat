40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimentally investigate the influence of air mixing fans on air temperature and humidity distribution in an arched roof greenhouse. The greenhouse was occupied by a tomato crop and equipped with two side roll-up openings for ventilation, a PVC pipe heating system and a fan coil heater. Furthermore, for air mixing purposes, an <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>fan</b> was used. Air temperature and relative humidity was simultaneously recorded in 17 positions equally distributed inside the greenhouse. Concerning the effects of <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>fan</b> on microclimate distribution, {{it was found that}} the mixing fan increased microclimate homogeneity. On the other hand, the use of fan-coil heater was found to increase microclimate heterogeneity. The maximum absolute air temperature and relative humidity difference (observed above the crop) between the centre of the greenhouse and the different measuring positions at the same level, was about 1 °C and 4 % respectively when the <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>fan</b> was not used and about 0. 4 °C and 1 % respectively, when the <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>fan</b> was used. The use of a fan-coil heater increased the above mentioned differences to the level of about 1. 7 °C and 6 % respectively when the <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>fan</b> was not used and about 1 °C and 3 % respectively, when the <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>fan</b> was used. Finally, it was observed that the use of an <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>fan</b> and/or a fan-coil heater reduced the greenhouse air relative humidity...|$|E

40|$|Liquid {{desiccant}} is an energy-saving, {{environmentally friendly}} and healthy means of air dehumidification. A liquid desiccant-based all-air {{air conditioning system}} is studied by simulation. Two different modes of <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> between the return air and the fresh air are compared, that is mixing before and mixing after the liquid desiccant dehumidifier, respectively. System performance and total energy consumption of the two modes under different operation conditions are obtained. The results show that <b>mixing</b> <b>air</b> after dehumidification consumes less energy than <b>mixing</b> <b>air</b> before dehumidification. Coefficient of performance (COP) of the all-air system with <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> after dehumidification is higher. The differences of COP and energy consumption between the two <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> modes increase when the outdoor air temperature and relative humidity increase. Practical application: Liquid desiccant based all-air system is quite suitable for museums, libraries and computer centres where water {{is not allowed to}} enter the space for property safety and strict thermal-hygrometric control is necessary. The results of this paper provide guidelines on the selection of <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> modes in liquid desiccant-based all-air systems, considering energy consumption and system COP.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the influence of spray position on fuel <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> quality, three-dimensional numerical simulation of the working process of a heavy-duty diesel was conducted. To quantitatively study the mechanism {{of the effect of}} spray position on fuel <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> process, the deviation of spray centroid was introduced to describe the spray position change in combustion chamber. The results show that the gas intake swirl can affect the spatial distribution of spray in combustion chamber under three directions in cylindrical coordinate, in which the circumferential distribution is affected most. It then can be concluded that the spray can be limited to the vicinity of the combustion chamber axis. Better spray position, which is more helpful for the process of fuel <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> and combustion, can be achieved by using optimal swirl, so that the power performance will be improved...|$|R

25|$|Vertical <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> {{was invented}} by Erik Uppstu. His idea is to turn {{traditional}} vertical mixing to horizontal mixing. Closely spaced jets will form a flat plane. In traditional boilers this plane has been formed by secondary air. By placing the planes to 2/3 or 3/4 arrangement improved <b>mixing</b> results. Vertical <b>air</b> has a potential to reduce NOx as staging air helps in decreasing emissions. In vertical <b>air</b> <b>mixing,</b> primary <b>air</b> supply is arranged conventionally. Rest of the air ports are placed on interlacing 2/3 or 3/4 arrangement.|$|R
