25|$|Brown gravy: Traditionally a {{light and}} thin chicken, veal, or turkey gravy, {{somewhat}} salty and mildly spiced {{with a hint of}} pepper, or a sauce brune which is a combination of beef and chicken stock, a variant originating in Quebec. The gravy should be substantial, but still thin enough to easily filter down into the mass of fries and cheese curds. These sauces typically also contain vinegar or a sour flavouring to balance the richness of the cheese <b>and</b> <b>fries.</b> Traditional poutine sauces (mélange à sauce poutine) are sold in Quebec, Ontario, and Maritime grocery stores in jars or cans and in powdered mix packets; some grocery chains like Sobeys even offer their own house brand versions. Many places also offer vegetarian gravy as an option to cater to vegetarians.|$|E

25|$|Batman Annual #1 {{introduces}} a new origin for Mr. Freeze. Here, Victor Fries' fascination with cryonics {{began when he}} was a boy and his mother fell through the ice of a frozen lake. The ice was able to keep her preserved long enough for help to arrive, thus sparking his lifelong obsession with the cold. It is later revealed that the accident left Fries' mother in constant pain, <b>and</b> <b>Fries</b> ended her suffering by pushing her into the same frozen lake. In this new origin, Nora was never Fries' wife. Her name was Nora Fields, a woman born in 1943. When Nora was 23, she was diagnosed with an incurable heart disease, so her family placed her in cryogenic stasis hoping that a cure would be found in the future. Fries, having written his doctoral thesis on Nora, took on a position as a cryogenic researcher and technician at Wayne Enterprises, the facility that housed Nora's body.|$|E

However, some BK stores do sell food under their [...] "Burgers for Breakfast" [...] program. While for several years the company dictated hours to its franchisees in the United States, that changed with the sale of the company in 2010. The new owners relaxed the mandated hours for stores to be open from 6am to midnight Monday through Saturday and 7am to midnight on Sundays; franchises were encouraged to stay open later or for 24 hours in markets that could support the business.|$|E
500|$|Burger King's product {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes over the years. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company touted its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. When McDonald's moved to eliminate its styrofoam packaging, Burger King ran several sarcastically-worded ads in national newspapers stating that it had always wrapped its sandwiches in waxed paper; they welcomed McDonald's [...] "to the club". To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was mostly eliminated in 1991; it was replaced with waxed paper. Paperboard boxes are still used for its [...] "finger food" [...] products like Chicken Tenders <b>and</b> <b>Fries,</b> French toast sticks, and desserts.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>frying</b> <b>and</b> roasting on nuts. <b>Frying</b> <b>and</b> roasting were performed according to the local Jordanian home-made cuisine, and the nuts under experiment were raw almonds, pine, cashew, and pistachio. Nuts samples were roasted at 110 °C for 16 minutes <b>and</b> <b>fried</b> at 175 °C for 2. 5 minutes. The results show that both roasting <b>and</b> <b>frying</b> of nuts {{did not affect the}} flavonoids content except for roasted pistachios where significant rise of flavonoids content was detected. Total phenolic content showed no significant differences except for pine nuts in which it increased significantly in both roasting <b>and</b> <b>frying.</b> Oxidative stability, presented by 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH), was significantly different in all nuts except for pistachio nuts that have shown no differences. Fatty acids profile, presented by saturated fatty acids (SFA), oleic acid (OL), and essential fatty acids (EFA), was affected significantly by roasting <b>and</b> <b>frying,</b> especially for SFA in almonds and pine nuts and α-linoleic acid (ALA) contents of pine.

2500|$|One {{particularly}} notorious {{example of}} this first came to public attention in the mid-1990s, when the Center for Science in the Public Interest produced a report about [...] "Movie Popcorn", which {{became the subject of}} a widespread publicity campaign. The movie theaters surveyed used coconut oil to pop the corn, and then topped it with butter or margarine. [...] "A medium-size buttered popcorn", the report said, [...] "contains more fat than a breakfast of bacon and eggs, a Big Mac <b>and</b> <b>fries,</b> and a steak dinner combined."

2500|$|Mr. Freeze {{appears in}} season 2 of Gotham, portrayed by Nathan Darrow. In this version, his surname is {{pronounced}} [...] ""; though Gordon does initially believe it's pronounced [...] "freeze". As in the comics, he is {{a scientist who}} researches cryogenic technology {{to find a cure}} for his wife Nora's terminal illness. To this end, he freezes people with a cryogenic gun and uses them as test subjects. When Nora dies during one of the experiments, Fries attempts suicide by turning the coolants from his gun on himself. He survives, however, and is rendered unable to survive outside of sub-zero temperatures. Hugo Strange has him declared dead and takes him to Arkham Asylum's Indian Hill Laboratory, where he intends to use him as an [...] "assistant" [...] in experiments with cryogenically frozen bodies. Strange also dispatches him to kill Karen Jennings, one of his former test subjects. In the season finale, [...] "Wrath of the Villains: Transference", Strange orders Fries to kill Selina Kyle, but Bridgit Pike, another of Strange's genetically altered minions, interferes. She <b>and</b> <b>Fries</b> do battle, he with his freeze ray and she with her flamethrower; they accidentally incapacitate Strange when he gets in the crossfire. In the episode [...] "Heroes Rise: The Primal Riddle," [...] Oswald Cobblepot and Ivy Pepper find Victor Fries in an arctic location. They persuade him to help Oswald in his revenge on Edward Nygma by returning his special suit to him that they took from Wayne Enterprises and promising to help him cure his condition. He is shown to still be at odds with Bridgit Pike by the time they regroup at Oswald Cobblepot's mansion. In the episode [...] "Heroes Rise: Destiny Calling," [...] Victor Fries assisted Fish Mooney into obtaining the earlier antidotes for the Alice Tetch Virus and fighting the ninjas from the League of Assassins at the time when the chaos caused by the Alice Tetch Virus was caused.

6000|$|In 1852 M. Naudin, a {{distinguished}} botanist, expressly stated, in an admirable {{paper on the}} Origin of Species ("Revue Horticole", page 102; since partly republished in the [...] "Nouvelles Archives du Museum", tom. i, page 171), his belief that species are formed in an analogous manner as varieties are under cultivation; and the latter process he attributes to man's power of selection. But he does not show how selection acts under nature. He believes, like Dean Herbert, that species, when nascent, were more plastic than at present. He lays weight on {{what he calls the}} principle of finality, [...] "puissance mysterieuse, indeterminee; fatalite pour les uns; pour les autres volonte providentielle, dont l'action incessante sur les etres vivantes determine, a toutes les epoques de l'existence du monde, la forme, le volume, et la duree de chacun d'eux, en raison de sa destinee dans l'ordre de choses dont il fait partie. C'est cette puissance qui harmonise chaque membre a l'ensemble, en l'appropriant a la fonction qu'il doit remplir dans l'organisme general de la nature, fonction qui est pour lui sa raison d'etre." [...] (From references in Bronn's [...] "Untersuchungen uber die Entwickelungs-Gesetze", it appears that the celebrated botanist and palaeontologist Unger published, in 1852, his belief that species undergo development and modification. Dalton, likewise, in Pander and Dalton's work on Fossil Sloths, expressed, in 1821, a similar belief. Similar views have, as is well known, been maintained by Oken in his mystical [...] "Natur-Philosophie".
