40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether intradermal (ID) vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is suitable as an alternative for the usually used intramuscular (IM) route. We compared vaccine efficacy in groups of pigs in which vaccine administration differed with respect to antigen payload of the vaccine, administrated volume and administration route. When compared with pigs that were IM vaccinated with a full dose vaccine with a standard antigen payload, pigs vaccinated ID with 1 / 10 dose of the same vaccine were equally protected against clinical disease and subclinical virus shedding. The ID vaccinated pigs were protected against virus shedding at a significant lower VN-titre as compared to IM vaccinated pigs, suggesting that immune responses other than neutralising antibodies also contributed to protection. We conclude that the ID route might be a good alternative for IM <b>application,</b> as <b>ID</b> <b>application</b> might induce a very efficient immunological response against FMD and, moreover, because the dose required by the ID route is lower compared to the IM route, <b>ID</b> <b>application</b> may reduce the production costs per dose of FMD vaccine markedl...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUNDâ€”Anal fissure is perpetuated by high {{sphincter}} {{pressures and}} secondary local ischaemia. Pharmacological approaches include topical nitrates and botulinum toxin (BT) which act to reduce anal pressure. BT lowers anal pressure by preventing acetylcholine release from nerve terminals while topical nitrates act by donating nitric oxide (NO). The {{aims of the}} present study were to compare the therapeutic effect and lowering action on internal anal sphincter pressure of BT injection and local application of isosorbide dinitrate (ID) compared with BT given alone, in patients with chronic anal fissure (CAF) refractory to treatment with ID. â€¨METHODSâ€”Thirty consecutive patients with CAF who did not respond to previous topical ID treatments were randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatments: group A, injection of BT (20 Â U into the internal anal sphincter) and subsequent daily <b>applications</b> of <b>ID</b> (2. 5 Â mg three times daily for three months); and group B, BT injection only (20 Â U). If at the end of six weeks following BT injection no improvement was seen in group B, ID was added. A series of anal pressure measurements, including resting basal pressure and resting pressure following topical ID (1. 25,Â  2. 5,Â and 3. 75 Â mg), was carried out both before and two weeks after 20 Â U of BT injection into the internal anal sphincter. At the end of the trial, patients were followed up for an average period of 10 Â months. â€¨FINDINGSâ€”At six weeks the fissure healing rate was significantly higher in group A patients (10 / 15 (66 %)) compared with group B (3 / 15 (20 %)) (p= 0. 025). At eight and 12 Â weeks, no significant differences were seen: 11 / 15 (73 %) v 11 / 15 (73 %) and 9 / 15 (60 %) v 10 / 15 (66 %), group A v group B, respectively. Maximum anal resting pressure (MARP) was significantly lower two weeks after BT injection than baseline MARP (90 Â (4) v 110 Â (5) mm Hg; p< 0. 001). A significantly greater reduction in MARP following local <b>application</b> of <b>ID</b> was achieved after BT injection compared with that achieved before BT injection (p= 0. 037) â€¨INTERPRETATIONâ€”(1) Combined BT injection and local <b>application</b> of <b>ID</b> in patients with CAF who failed previous treatment with ID was more effective than BT alone. This treatment modality appears to be safe and promising. (2) <b>ID</b> <b>application</b> induced a greater reduction in MARP following BT injection compared with <b>ID</b> <b>application</b> before BT injection. The improved potency of ID on MARP after BT injection suggests a primary cholinergic tonus dominance in some patients and not, as previously claimed, anal sphincter insensitivity to nitrates. â€¨â€¨â€¨Keywords: nitrates; botulinum toxin; anal fissur...|$|R
30|$|The {{growth of}} {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSN) has resulted in part from requirements for connecting sensors and advances in radio technologies. WSN nodes {{may be required to}} save energy and therefore wake up and sleep in a synchronized way. In this paper, we propose an application-driven WSN node synchronization mechanism which, by making use of cross-layer information such as <b>application</b> <b>ID</b> and duty cycle, and by using the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) technique, enables nodes to wake up and sleep without losing synchronization. The results obtained confirm that this mechanism maintains the nodes in a mesh network synchronized according to the applications they run, while maintaining a high packet reception ratio.|$|E
40|$|Key based routing (KBR) enables {{peer-to-peer}} {{applications to}} create and use distributed services. KBR is more flexible than distributed hash tables (DHT). However, the broader the application area, the more important become performance issues for a KBR service. In this paper, we present a novel approach to provide a generic KBR service. Its key idea {{is to use a}} predictable address assignment scheme. This scheme allows peers to calculate the overlay address of the node that is responsible for a given key and <b>application</b> <b>ID.</b> A public DHT service such as OpenDHT can then resolve this overlay address to the transport address of the respective peer. We compare our solution to alternative proposals such as ReDiR and Diminished Chord.

In particular, unlike ReDiR, our solution can guarantee a low latency for KBR route operations. 1...|$|E

We present a simple metrics to measure correlations of events that may happen interleavedly. On {{the basis of the}} measurement of correlations, we propose two approaches to mine event correlations; meanwhile, we propose an innovative abstractionâ€” event correlation graphs (ECGs) to represent event correlations, and present an ECGs-based algorithm for predicting events. For two system logs of a production Hadoop-based cloud computing system at Research Institution of China Mobile and a production HPC cluster system at Los Alamos National Lab (LANL), we evaluate our approaches in three scenarios: (a) predicting all events on the basis of both failure and non-failure events; (b) predicting only failure events on the basis of both failure and non-failure events; (c) predicting failure events after removing non-failure events.

40|$|Three mutants with deletions in the E 2 gene of the {{infectious}} DNA copy of {{the classical}} swine fever virus (CSFV) strain-C were constructed: one missing the B/C domain of CSFV-E 2 between amino acids (aa) 693 and 746, one missing the A domain between aa 800 and 864, and one missing the complete E 2 between aa 689 and 1062. All three CSFV-E 2 deletion mutants were unable to generate viable virus, indicating {{that each of the}} antigenic domains of E 2 is essential for viability of CSFV. To rescue the CSFV-E 2 deletion mutants SK 6 cell lines constitutively expressing glycoprotein E 2 of CSFV were generated. The rescued viruses infected and replicated in SK 6 cells as demonstrated by expression of viral proteins, but this primary infection did not result in reproduction of infectious virus. Thus, these E 2 complemented viruses are considered non-transmissible. In previous experiments, we showed that simultaneous injection of Erns complemented virus (Flc 23) via intradermal (ID), intramuscular (IM) or intranasal (IN) routes conferred protection to pigs against a lethal challenge with CSFV [J. Virol. 74 (2000) 2973]. Here, we evaluate different routes of <b>application</b> (<b>ID,</b> IM or IN) with Erns complemented virus Flc 23 in order to find the best route for complemented CSFVs. Intradermal injection with Flc 23 protected pigs against a lethal CSFV challenge, whereas intramuscular injection induced partial protection, and intranasal injection did not mediate a protective immune response in pigs at all. We used the intradermal route of vaccination to test the E 2 complemented viruses. Vaccination of pigs via the intradermal route with the E 2 complemented CSFVs also resulted in the induction of antibodies and in (partial) protection against CSFV challenge. Pigs vaccinated with E 2 complemented virus Flc 4 (deletion B/C domain) survived a lethal CSFV challenge, whereas partial protection was induced in pigs vaccinated with Flc 47 (deletion E 2) or Flc 48 (deletion A domain) E 2 complemented viruses. Serological data demonstrate that these E 2 complemented mutant viruses are, in combination with well known diagnostic tests based on E 2, potential marker vaccines for CSF...|$|E
