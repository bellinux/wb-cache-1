50|$|<b>Atracurium</b> <b>besilate</b> is a {{medication}} used {{in addition to}} other medications to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. It {{can also be used to}} help with endotracheal intubation but suxamethonium (succinylcholine) is generally preferred if this needs to be done quickly. It is given by injection into a vein. Effects are greatest at about 4 minutes and last for up to an hour.|$|E
50|$|Chlortetracycline may {{increase}} the anticoagulant activities of acenocoumarol. The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when chlortetracycline is combined with acitretin, adapalene, or alitretinoin. Aluminum phosphate and aluminum hydroxide can cause decreases in the absorption of chlortetracycline resulting in a reduced serum concentration and potentially a decrease in efficacy. The therapeutic efficacy of mecillinam (amdinocillin), amoxicillin, and ampicillin can be decreased when used in combination with chlortetracycline.

5000|$|<b>Atracurium</b> <b>besilate</b> {{was first}} made in 1974 by George H. Dewar, a {{pharmacist}} and a medicinal chemistry doctoral candidate in John B. Stenlake's medicinal chemistry {{research group in}} the Department of Pharmacy at Strathclyde University, Scotland. Dewar first named this compound [...] "33A74" [...] before its eventual emergence in the clinic as atracurium. Atracurium {{was the culmination of}} a rational approach to drug design to produce the first non-depolarizing non-steroidal skeletal muscle relaxant that undergoes chemodegradation in vivo. The term chemodegradation was coined by Roger D. Waigh, Ph.D., also a pharmacist and a postdoctoral researcher in Stenlake's research group. Atracurium was licensed by Strathclyde University to the Wellcome Foundation UK, which developed the drug (then known as BW 33A) and its introduction to first human trials in 1979, and then eventually to its first introduction (as a mixture of all ten stereoisomers) into clinical anesthetic practice in the UK, in 1983, under the tradename of Tracrium.|$|E
40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{choice of}} anesthesia for patients (pts) undergoing renal transplantation (Ktx) requires minimal toxicity and accurate monitoring for pts {{at high risk}} for metabolic, cardiovascular, and respiratory perioperative complications. We evaluated the anesthetic management and postoperative follow-up in pediatric Ktx performed in the last 12 years in our institution. From 1988 to 1999, 75 ASA class II-III pts (45 males, 22 females) younger than 18 years scheduled for Ktx were studied: 39 received a graft from a cadaveric donor (CD) and 26 from a living donor (LD). All pts were treated with dialysis within 24 h before the procedure. Standard monitoring consisted of an electrocardiogram, central venous pressure, non-invasive arterial pressure, pulse oximetry, and inspiratory and expiratory gas analysis. If necessary, an arterial cannula and pediatric pulmonary catheter were introduced. Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental, propofol, halothane, or sevoflurane and maintained with isoflurane and/or fentanyl and droperidol in O- 2 :N 2 O (FiO(2) 0. 4 %). As muscle relaxants <b>atracurium</b> or cisatracurium <b>besilate</b> were used, except in allergic pts, in whom vecuronium or rocuronium bromide was administered. Dopamine, 20 % mannitol, and furosemide were used to increase diuresis. Continuous morphine and ketoralac infusions were used for postoperative pain relief. The surgical technique was the same in all cases. Complications and renal-function (RF) recovery were evaluated relating to CD and LD using the chi-square test; differences in mean anesthesia and surgical time were evaluated by Student's t-test; survival curves were calculated from the day of Ktx to death or last follow-up and estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Values of P below 0. 05 were considered significant. Postoperative immunosuppressive therapy was based on cyclosporine together with other conventional drugs. Mean anesthesia time was 228 +/- 65 min. Mean kidney ischemia time for CD was 16. 5 +/- 4 h. Four pts (3 CD, 1 LD) died within 72 h postoperatively: 3 due to cardiac failure and 1 to metabolic coma. Six pts showed cardiovascular and 3 had infective complications, all successfully treated. Three pts (2 CD, 1 LD) died within 2 to 12 months after, surgery; 10 (6 CD, 4 LD) had graft failure and are still alive on dialysis; 58 (38 CD, 20 LD) are alive in good health after a mean follow-up of 57. 6 +/- 36. 6 months (range 12 - 120 months). Fifteen of 26 pts younger than 12 years (21 CD and 5 LD) recovered RF intraoperatively (10 CD, 5 LD); 1 with CD and 1 with LD showed postoperative graft failure and 2 with CD died within 72 h postoperatively, 22 (18 CD and 4 LD) are alive in good health. This group showed no statistical difference compared to pts older than 12 years. Of 16 pts (15 CD and 1 LD) with body weight (BW) less than 25 kg, 6 showed intraoperative (5 CD, I LD) recovery of RF. The 3 deaths were all in CD pts, 3 within 72 h and one 2 months after surgery; only 1 LD had postoperative graft failure. Twelve pts (75 %) (12 CD, 80 %) are alive in good health. Compared to pts with BW of 25 kg or more, this group showed lower intraoperative recovery of RF (P I 0. 05). No peri- and postoperative complications occurred in all 26 LD pts (100 %). Recent advances in surgery, anesthesia, immunosuppression, and antimicrobial prophylaxis have made Ktx a more predictable procedure even in pediatric pts. For high-risk pts, mortality and morbidity can be controlled by accurate surgical, anesthetic, and postoperative management. Pts younger than 12 years and with BW less than 25 kg are more likely to develop peri- and postoperative complications...|$|R
40|$|Objective  To {{explore the}} {{feasibility}} of dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant of sevoflurane for controlled hypotension in endoscopic sinus surgery. Methods  Forty-eight patients (ASA Ⅰor Ⅱ) scheduled for endoscopic sinus surgery were randomly assigned into two groups (n = 24) : control group (group I) and dexmedetomidine group (group Ⅱ). In both groups, intravenous injection of midazolam, propofol, fentanyl, and <b>atracurium</b> <b>besilate</b> was given to induce anesthesia, and propofol, fentanyl, <b>atracurium</b> <b>besilate,</b> together with sevoflurane inhalation were used to maintain anesthesia. The radial artery was cannulated to monitor the invasive mean arterial pressure (MAP). Controlled hypotension was induced by adjusting the sevoflurane concentration in group Ⅰ. In group Ⅱ, within 15 min to 30 min before the induction of anesthesia, dexmedetomidine was administered in a dose of 0. 8 μg/kg via intravenous infusion pump, then maintained at 0. 4 μg/(kg·h). Sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to maintain the target blood pressure {{at the beginning of}} surgery. The MAP was maintained at 65 - 75 mmHg up to the end of operation. Meanwhile, the heart rate (HR), MAP, epinephrine (E), and norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were recorded at the time of induction of anesthesia (T 0), beginning of controlled hypotension (T 1), 30 min after controlled hypotension (T 2), and at the time when extubation was performed (T 3). Blood gas analysis and determination of lactic acid concentration were conducted using the blood drawn from the radial artery during the operation. The surgical field quality was assessed based on Fromme scores of surgical field quality (SSFQ). Meanwhile, the dose of sevoflurane, propofol, and fentanyl, MAP, the recovery time of anesthesia, and the incidence rate of untoward eﬀects were recorded. Results  The doses of propofol, fentanyl and sevoflurane, and MAC value in group Ⅱwas significantly diminished compared with group Ⅰ(P ＜ 0. 01). In addition, the surgical field quality was better, whereas SSFQ was obviously lower in group Ⅱ(P ＜ 0. 05). The HR at the time of T 0 to T 3, and the MAP, E, and NE at the time of T 0 and T 3 in group Ⅱwere obviously lower compared with group Ⅰ(P ＜ 0. 05). The results of blood gas analysis and lactic acid, and the time of regaining consciousness and extubation showed no statistical diﬀerence between the two groups (P ＞ 0. 05). Moreover, the incidence rates of nose distending pain, headache, delirium, and shivering were obviously lower in group Ⅱ(P ＜ 0. 05). However, the incidence rate of bradycardia needing intervention was higher in group Ⅱthan in group Ⅰ. No severe cardiovascular emergency was noted in the two groups. Conclusion  Dexmedetomidine can reduce the dose of anesthetic drugs, improve the cardiovascular stability during the perioperative period, accelerate the time to recovery of consciousness, and is safe and eﬀective in assisting controlled hypotension during endoscopic sinus surgery. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{investigated}} whether the precentral component (N 30) of short somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to median nerve stimulation may be modified by peripheral neuromuscular blocking agent in patients affected by rigidity. We, therefore, recorded SEPs in nine Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and in seven psychotic patients affected by neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), all showing severe rigidity. Each patient group was studied {{before and after the}} placebo, and before and after an <b>atracurium</b> <b>besilate</b> bolus of 0. 05 mg/kg, in a single recording session. At the time of the test the PD patients had not taken any antiparkinsonian therapy for at least 48 h. The same recordings were also taken on nine neurologically normal subjects undergoing surgical procedures. Atracurium administration produced a remarkable amplitude increase of the major precentral component (N 30) of SEPs. An atracurium-induced N 30 amplitude increase was observed in both PD patients (from 2. 41 to 4. 07 microV) and NMS psychotic patients (from 2. 03 to 3. 97 microV), whereas there was a minor N 30 amplitude increase in healthy subjects (from 3. 53 to 4. 10 microV). The N 30 latency was unaffected. Amplitude and latency of the major parietal SEPs component (N 20) was unchanged in the three groups studied. Our results lead to the conclusion that a neuromuscular blocking agent is capable of increasing the N 30 amplitude in patients affected by severe rigidity, exclusively reducing their muscular tone without interfering with the central dopaminergic system. Thus, a "peripheral gating" of sensory input to the supplementary motor area due to rigidity may play a relevant role in producing the N 30 amplitude decrease described in patients affected by degenerative or pharmacologically induced parkinsonism. The reduction of rigidity could be the mechanism by which dopamine may increase the precentral N 30 amplitude in parkinsonian syndromes...|$|E
40|$|Rapacuronium bromide (rapacuronium; ORG- 9487) is a nondepolarising {{muscle relaxant}} (NMBA) {{with a low}} potency [90 % {{effective}} dose(ED 90) 1 mg/kg], which to some extent is responsible for its rapid onset of action. Because of the: high plasma clearance (5. 3 to 11. 1 mg/kg/min) of rapacuronium, its clinical duration of action following single bolus doses up to 2 mg/kg in adults is short (i. e. 1. 5 mg/kg to facilitate rapid tracheal intubation, and to use succinylcholine or rocuronium rather than rapacuronium in a rapid-sequence setting. Rapacuronium, however, is a suitable alternative to mivacurium chloride (mivacurium) and succinylcholine for short procedures (e. g. ambulatory anaesthesia). Rocuronium bromide (rocuronium) is a relatively low-potent, intermediate-acting NMBA. Its main advantage is the rapid onset of neuromuscular block whereby good or excellent intubating conditions are achieved within 60 to 90 seconds after rocuronium 0. 6 mg/kg (2 x ED 95). and within 60 to 180 seconds after smaller doses (1 to 1. 5 x ED 95). Larger doses of rocuronium (greater {{than or equal to}} 1 mg/kg) seem to be suitable for rapid-sequence induction under relatively light anaesthesia. However, it is still a matter of controversy whether, {{in the case of an}} unanticipated difficult intubation, the long duration of rocuronium administered in such large doses outweighs the many adverse effects of succinylcholine. Rocuronium has mild vagolytic effects and does not release histamine. even when administered in large doses. Rocuronium is primarily eliminated via the liver and its pharmacokinetic profile is similar to that of vecuronium bromide (vecuronium). Unlike vecuronium, rocuronium has no metabolite. Cisatracurium besilate (cisatracurium). the 1 R-cis, 1 'R-cis isomer of <b>atracurium</b> <b>besilate</b> (atracurium) is approximately 4 times more potent than atracurium. The onset time of cisatracurium is significantly slower than after equipotent doses of atracurium. The recommended intubating dose is 0. 15 to 0. 2 mg/kg (3 to 4 times ED 95). Over a wide range of clinically relevant doses the recovery proper ties of cisatracurium are affected by neither the size of the bolus dose nor by the duration of infusion. Unlike atracurium, cisatracurium does not trigger histamine release. Like atracurium. cisatracurium undergoes Hofmann elimination. In contrast to atracurium. cisatracurium does not undergo hydrolysis by nonspecific plasma esterases. Moreover, about 77 % of the drug is cleared by organ-dependent mechanisms...|$|E
