Experimental data from these simulations as well as an extensive set of stress tests are presented and analyzed. Results indicate that while the problem is NP-hard in general, practical instances of the algorithm are not necessarily very hard to solve.

40|$|Recent {{trends in}} robot arm control {{have seen a}} shift towards {{end-to-end}} solutions, using deep reinforcement learning to learn a controller directly from raw sensor data, {{rather than relying on}} a hand-crafted, modular pipeline. However, the high dimensionality of the state space often means that it is impractical to generate sufficient training data with real-world experiments. As an alternative solution, we propose to learn a robot controller in simulation, with the potential of then transferring this to a real robot. Building upon the recent success of deep Q-networks, we present an approach which uses 3 D simulations to train a 7 -DOF robotic arm in a control task without any prior knowledge.

40|$|Abstract Important applications, like e-commerce, traffic control, {{mobile and}} {{intelligent}} network services database demand real-time data services. Also, these applications are inherently distributed in nature. A database for these realtime data services has to support timing constraints and temporal consistency {{in addition to}} supporting characteristics of a conventional database system. Conventional database perform poor at these applications. It is even more challenging to provide timing constraints in a distributed environment. Transaction workloads in a distributed environment are unbalanced and access patterns may be time varying. Data replication is an effective method to help database systems meet the stringent temporal requirements of real-time applications. The algorithms for QoS guarantees for data services in a distributed real-time database are introduced in the literature. In this paper, we have designed an algorithm that provides QoS guarantees for data services in a distributed real-time environment, where hundreds of sites may be involved and one site {{may not be aware}} of the workload status of other sites. The algorithm consists of a local <b>controller</b> <b>accepting</b> workload from other sites or transferring excess workload to underutilized sites as directed by a centralized load balancer.

40|$|In this project, an MPPT {{based on}} simple fuzzy logic control {{strategy}} is proposed for two-stage grid interactive PV system. DC-DC boost converter as first stage and three-phase {{voltage source inverter}} as second stage. The boost converter stage provides not only the boosting of PV output voltage for grid connectivity but also used as MPP tracker. The second inverter stage is used for multiple functions: (i) active power injection, (ii) harmonic compensation of non linear load connected with the grid, and (iii) reactive power compensation of the load. The additional functionality of the PV inverter as a shunt active power filter increases the overall efficiency of the system.

Two observers shadowed air traffic controllers at the Atlanta (ZTL) and Jacksonville (ZJX) air traffic control centers as the test flight pilot made pre-scripted requests to invoke acceptability issues and then they interviewed the observed and other controllers voluntarily. Fifty controllers were interviewed with experience ranging from one to thirty-five years.

All interviewed <b>controllers</b> <b>accept</b> more than fifty percent of pilot requests; forty percent of them reject less than ten percent of requests. The most common reason for rejecting requests is conflicting with traffic followed by violating letters of agreement (LOAs) and negatively impacting neighboring sector workload, major arrival and departure flows and flow restrictions. Thirty-six requests were made during the test, eight of which were rejected due to: the aircraft already handed off to another sector, violating LOA, opposing traffic, intruding into an active special use airspace (SUA), intruding into another center, weather, and unfamiliarity with the requested waypoint.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Lyapunov-based {{switching}} logic {{within the framework}} of adaptive mixing control (AMC), where a weighted combination of a family of candidate controllers can be inserted in the loop to regulate the output of an uncertain plant. The proposed AMC scheme employs a bank of parallel estimators, or multiple estimators, together with a switching logic that orchestrates which estimate should be evaluated by the mixer. The switching logic is driven by input/output data and uses Lyapunov-based criteria to assess the best estimate among the bank of parallel estimates. The resulting scheme guarantees convergence of the switching signal in finite time to a controller that satisfies a Lyapunov inequality implying a prescribed stability margin. The problem of convergence to the desired controller is addressed both analytically and numerically. In contrast, most classes of continuous tuning adaptive control or switching adaptive control schemes do not guarantee that after the switching stops or the adaptation is switched off the resulting closed loop linear time-invariant (LTI) system is stable, unless there is sufficient plant excitation that guarantees convergence to the desired fixed parameter controller. The proposed scheme guarantees that if the desired controller is switched on, it will never be switched off thereafter. Furthermore, simulations demonstrate that while alternative adaptation methods can converge to an LTI unstable feedback loop, the proposed scheme consistently converges to the desired <b>controller.</b> <b>Accepted</b> Author ManuscriptHybrid and Distributed Systems and Contro...|$|R

Further disarray arises because the courts 2 ̆ 7 longstanding commitment to strict scrutiny in freezeouts is in tension with the popular disfavor towards private class-action litigation. This disarray threatens minority investors 2 ̆ 7 interests in freezeouts, and capital market values more broadly. First, the disparities in freezeout doctrine have encouraged controllers to arbitrage the legal standards for freezeouts in their self-interest.

Second, recently proposed judicial reforms to freezeout doctrine would leave minorities in freezeouts stranded in a limbo between the market and the law - without adequate protections of either kind. Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s Chancery Court has become sensitive to this doctrinal disarray and has proposed fundamental reforms. In a recent trilogy of opinions it has attempted to unify freezeout doctrine. However, these cases also indict equity 2 ̆ 7 s longstanding commitment to reviewing freezeouts for Entire Fairness (fair dealings and fair price on the controller 2 ̆ 7 s part). They propose that minorities 2 ̆ 7 claims of unfairness in freezeouts should be dismissible on the pleadings if the controller 2 ̆ 7 s deal received the seemingly freely given approval of disinterested directors and stockholders (Dual Ratification). The Article reviews the foundations of both lines of freezeout doctrine and proposes alternative standards for reform. It agrees with the recent cases that unifying freezeout doctrine is a positive objective; but it rejects the view that strict judicial oversight is gratuitous because minorities would be adequately protected by Dual Ratification. As envisioned in the recent cases, the latter would operate merely as a simulacrum of arms 2 ̆ 7 -length dealings, and thus systematically advantage controllers over minorities.
