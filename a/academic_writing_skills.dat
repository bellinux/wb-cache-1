The subjects of the research were the students of S 1 Physiotherapy program, Health Science Faculty of Muhammadiyah University of Surakarta in the first semester of the academic year 2012 / 2013 who were taking the Indonesian subject.

40|$|In this research, we {{investigated}} whether observational learning improves the <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> of university {{students in the}} department of Education and Child studies. As baseline measurement the students had to write a review. We used an experimental condition and a control condition. In the control condition the students worked on their writing strategies (N= 92). In the experimental condition the students got two examples of writing to examine (N= 116), one weak example and one strong example. Afterwards students in both conditions had to write a paragraph. At the end of the subject all students had to write a paper. The grades on this paper were used as a post-test. The research question of this study is: What is the effect of observational learning on the <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> of first year students? We hypothesised that the <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> of the students would improve when implementing observational learning.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} delivery of support for <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> development. The paper also presents {{a case study of}} such support on an undergraduate, part-time degree programme at University College Dublin (UCD). Elton (2010) suggests that the approach to academic writing is discipline dependent and that neither specialists in academic writing nor practising academics in a discipline can separately provide students with the necessary support to develop the ability to write. Three models of academic skills support are provided in the literature; bolt-on, build-on and build-up. These models provide a useful framework for conceptualizing the different approaches to skills development (academic writing in this case). The 2 ̆ 7 bolt on 2 ̆ 7 approach describes institutions that provide additional sessions to address academic writing (Wingate, 2006). The 2 ̆ 7 build-in 2 ̆ 7 approach is where the provision of such support is embedded into the curriculum and usually occurs early in a student’s studies. Finally, the ‘build-up’ approach, first suggested by Dowling and Ryan (2007), is explored. In this approach, institutions provide supports embedded in the delivery of the curriculum and allow students to 2 ̆ 7 build-up 2 ̆ 7 their <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> <b>skills,</b> not only upon programme commencement, but throughout the duration of their studies. The paper asserts a greater likelihood of success in developing <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> where interventions are embedded within a broader framework of student support.

40|$|Where {{students}} do not see a direct connection between academic skills teaching and their assessment they {{find it difficult to}} perceive its benefit. In our experience when <b>academic</b> and <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> have been delivered as a ‘bolt-on’, student engagement has been limited. Indeed such provision has received criticism as students find it difficult to see the relevance to their learning (Wingate, 2006). In addition, this lack of engagement with <b>academic</b> and <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> teaching has resulted in limited directed writing practice. The literature has suggested that there is a positive developmental relationship between writing and thinking and learning. Regular writing practice ‘promotes thinking, learning and communication’ (Bjork et al., 2003, p. 9). The benefits of reflective thinking and writing in relation to skills development are also well documented in the literature (Moon, 1999; King, 2002). Indeed, the skill of reflection is highlighted with in the UK QAA benchmarking statement for postgraduate students (QAA, 2007).
