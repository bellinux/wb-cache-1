5|$|Whether Ragnall or Rǫgnvaldr, William's act {{of using}} <b>a</b> <b>grandson</b> of Óláfr in Caithness {{may have been}} an example of the king playing one member of the jarlsaetten against another. The jarlsaetten were people who possessed a claim to an earldom, in {{accordance}} with Norse custom, by right of their descent from previous earls. There are earlier instances of such claimants requesting Scottish kings for what they considered their birthright, and William certainly did this when he granted Caithness to Haraldr Eiríksson, <b>a</b> <b>grandson</b> of Rǫgnvaldr Kali Kolsson, Earl of Orkney. If Ragnall was indeed a descendant of Ingibjǫrg, a daughter of Páll Hákonarson, Earl of Orkney (died 1137), he was directly descended from previous Scandinavian earls. Whereas Óláfr's marriage to Ingibjǫrg may have meant that Rǫgnvaldr was regarded {{as a member of the}} jarlsaetten as well, and a cousin to Haraldr himself.|$|E
