5|$|As {{a general}} rule, since that time, {{the armed forces}} have not intervened in {{politics}} as a body, rather being tossed and turned as ambitious men have shaken the country.

5|$|Fielding's thirteenth play, The Modern Husband, first ran on 14 February 1732. The play ran for 13 {{nights at}} Drury Lane, rivalling {{the run of}} the Provok'd Husband and Zara for {{production}} length. Although early-20th-century critics believed that the play could not be popular, it did make money and even put on a benefit show on 2 March 1732. The play was not revived later, possibly because the principal actors of the play died soon after and the plot of the play discouraged new actors from wanting to play the parts. The plot deals with a man selling his wife for money and the attempted <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adultery laws.|$|E

5|$|General sejm was {{the highest}} organ of {{collective}} and consensus-based state power. The Sejm's supreme court, presided over by the king, decided the most serious of legal cases. During {{the second half of}} the 17th century, for a variety of reasons, including <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unanimity rule (liberum veto), sejm's effectiveness had declined, and the void was being increasingly filled by sejmiks, where in practice the bulk of government's work was getting done.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Dworkin {{published}} , which analyzes (and extensively cites examples drawn from) {{contemporary and}} historical pornography {{as an industry}} of woman-hating dehumanization. Dworkin argues that it is implicated in violence against women, both in its production (through the <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> women used to star in it), and in the social consequences of its consumption by encouraging men to eroticize the domination, humiliation, and abuse of women.|$|E

The PAP studied their proposals and later implemented some, such as a National non-profit Special Needs Trust Fund. Laws were also drafted to prohibit <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mentally disabled and to allow parents to appoint someone to look after their special needs children after they die.|$|E

5|$|Parliament {{was summoned}} in 1559 to {{consider}} the Reformation Bill {{and to create a}} new church. The Reformation Bill defined the Communion as a consubstantial celebration as opposed to a transubstantial celebration, included <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pope in the litany, and ordered that ministers should not wear the surplice or other Roman Catholic vestments. It allowed ministers to marry, banned images from churches, and confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England.|$|E
5|$|The Act of Uniformity 1558, which forced {{people to}} attend Sunday service in an Anglican church {{with a new}} version of the Book of Common Prayer, passed by only three votes. The Bill of Uniformity was more {{cautious}} than the initial Reformation Bill. It revoked the harsh laws proposed against Roman Catholics, it removed the <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pope from the litany and kept the wording that allowed for both consubstantial and transubstantial beliefs in the presence of Christ in the Eucharist.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} formed in 1967 by Emerson, Lee Jackson, David O'List and Ian Hague to back soul singer P. P. Arnold. After {{replacing}} Hague with Brian Davison, the group set out on their own, quickly developing a strong live following. The group's sound was centred on Emerson's Hammond organ showmanship and <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument, and their radical rearrangements of classical music themes and Bob Dylan songs.|$|E

His sermon upon Doing Good, though peculiarly adapted to Ireland and Wood's designs upon it, contains perhaps the best motives to patriotism that were ever delivered within so small a compass.|$|E
5|$|Whatever one's {{suspicions about}} its use or <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evidence, JFK is a knockout. Part history book, part comic book, the movie rushes toward {{judgment}} for three breathless hours, lassoing facts and factoids by the thousands, then bundling them together into an incendiary device that would frag any viewer's complacency. Stone's picture is, in both {{meanings of the}} word, sensational: it's tip-top tabloid journalism. In its bravura and breadth, JFK is seditiously enthralling; in its craft, wondrously complex.|$|E
5|$|Drusus {{then settled}} an {{incident}} involving the <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protection afforded by icons of the princeps, {{in which the}} emperor's images were being used to shield the guilty. Gaius Cestius Gallus brought a complaint into the Senate, and claimed he was being abused under this safeguard by Annia Rufilla. Drusus was soon brought in to weigh on the matter, for the Senate felt only {{a member of the}} imperial family could speak on such a delicate matter. At the request of many senators, Drusus had Rufilla arrested and imprisoned. Later, he was given credit for the condemnation of two Roman equites, Considius Aequus and Coelius Cursor, who had attacked the praetor, Magius Caecilianus, with false charges of maiestas. It is unlikely that he himself was responsible, for every verdict was given by the Senate with Tiberius' authority, but this did not prevent his popularity.|$|E

5|$|In 1514, Las Casas was {{studying}} {{a passage in}} the book Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 34:18–22 for a Pentecost sermon and pondering its meaning. Las Casas was finally convinced that all {{the actions of the}} Spanish in the New World had been illegal and that they constituted a great injustice. He made up his mind to give up his slaves and encomienda, and started to preach that other colonists should do the same. When his preaching met with resistance, he realized {{that he would have to}} go to Spain to fight there against the enslavement and <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> native people. Aided by Pedro de Córdoba and accompanied by Antonio de Montesinos, he left for Spain in September 1515, arriving in Seville in November.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Steam {{began to}} accept player reviews of games. Other users can {{subsequently}} rate these reviews as helpful, humorous, or otherwise unhelpful, {{which are then}} used to highlight the most useful reviews on the game's Steam store page. Steam also aggregates these reviews and enable users to sort products based on this feedback while browsing the store. In May 2016, Steam further broke out these aggregations between all reviews overall and those made more recently in the last 30 days, a change Valve acknowledges to how game updates, particularly those in Early Access, can alter {{the impression of a}} game to users. To prevent observed <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> review system by developers or other third-party agents, Valve modified the review system in September 2016 to discount review scores for a game from users that activated the product through a product key rather than directly purchased by the Steam score, though their reviews remain visible. Alongside this, Valve announced that it would end business relations with any developer or publisher that they have found to be abusing the review system.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that the atrocities that Las Casas described were exaggerated or even invented, {{but this is not}} generally considered likely as Las Casas was far from the only person to be deeply worried about abuse and mistreatment of the Indians. The Dominican friars Antonio de Montesinos and Pedro de Córdoba had reported extensive violence already {{in the first decade of}} the conquest of the Indies, and throughout the conquest of the Americas there were reports of <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natives by friars and priests and ordinary citizens, and many massacres of indigenous people were reported in full by those who perpetrated them. Even some of Las Casas's enemies, such as Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, reported many gruesome atrocities committed against the Indians by the colonizers. All in all, modern historians tend to disregard the numerical figures given by Las Casas, but maintain that the general picture he presented of an intensely violent and abusive conquest did represent reality.|$|E

5|$|The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution prohibits {{unreasonable}} {{searches and}} seizures. It requires governmental searches and seizures {{to be conducted}} only upon issuance of a warrant, judicially sanctioned by probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing {{the place to be}} searched and the persons or things to be seized. It is part of the Bill of Rights and was adopted in response to the <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> writ of assistance, a type of general search warrant issued by the British government, and a major source of tension in pre-Revolutionary America. The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison, along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. Congress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789. By December 15, 1791, the necessary three-fourths of the states had ratified it. On March 1, 1792, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Amendment guards against {{unreasonable}} {{searches and}} seizures, along with requiring any warrant to be judicially sanctioned {{and supported by}} probable cause. It was adopted {{as a response to}} the <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> writ of assistance, which is a type of general search warrant, in the American Revolution. Search and seizure (including arrest) must be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court, usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it. The amendment is the basis for the exclusionary rule, which mandates that evidence obtained illegally cannot be introduced into a criminal trial. The amendment's interpretation has varied over time; its protections expanded under left-leaning courts such as that headed by Earl Warren and contracted under right-leaning courts such as that of William Rehnquist.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{even before}} the {{increase}} of <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Case Stated procedure, the United Kingdom {{was estimated to be}} losing £500 million a year through the movement of arbitration business to other countries. In response, the Lord Chancellor convened a Commercial Court Users Conference in 1960, and tasked them with reviewing the system; the conclusion was that the status quo should remain. With the increased use of the Case Stated procedure, more calls for reform came. In June 1977 the London Arbitration Group (LAG) was formed, taking it upon itself to make the government aware of the damage current law was causing. In 1978, in reaction to the continued pressure, the Lord Chancellor established a Commercial Court Committee to again look at the issue; their report, in June 1978, recommended changing the system so that appeal was only allowed when either the High Court permitted it, or both parties to the arbitration agreed it was necessary. This was intended to ensure that any new Act of Parliament fulfilled two roles – firstly, decreasing the use of the Case Stated procedure, and secondly, encouraging arbitrators to give reasons for their decisions.|$|E
