25|$|The {{first of}} the key {{measures}} that have been implemented in the 3 years since the SARS crisis ended was greatly increased commitment and leadership from the government to tackle public health problems. During the SARS epidemic, governmental and communist party leaders at all levels—from Paramount leader Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabo {{and members of the}} State Council down to village leaders—were involved in tackling a single public-health issue. The epidemic and its eventual control convinced Chinese leaders that the government should be much more involved in addressing public-health problems. After the SARS epidemic, the State Council developed a mechanism to oversee public-health emergencies directly. The State Council has also involved itself with other pressing public-health challenges, including HIV/AIDS, avian influenza, occupational safety, <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>health.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Greens {{base their}} health {{policies}} on prevention, and claim to consider health {{in areas such}} as organic agriculture, active transportation, urban planning, and education. In particular, party policy closely links the areas of disease prevention <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>health,</b> with policies such a ban on cosmetic pesticides, a Cancer Prevention Act, and doubling funding for the Ministry of Health Promotion. Policies on health care include expanding the Community Care Access Centre (CCAC) system, increasing support for multidisciplinary clinics (those with doctors, nurses, psychologists, dieticians, and other health care professionals), and increasing support for midwifery, along with a number of administrative reforms. GPO policy emphasizes a reduction in health care costs through avoidance of illness and expansion of alternative access models (such as CCACs), rather than simply closing facilities or increasing expenditures.|$|E
25|$|The {{metropolitan}} {{region has}} developed many utilities which have primary focus on energy <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>health.</b> A {{focal point of}} cross-border environmental relations is {{the care of the}} Tijuana River Estuary. The International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) was developed by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) as a joint project between the USA and Mexico in the mid-1990s following substantial environmental studies regarding the polluting affects of the river system from run-off and untreated water on the Tijuana side of the border region. The facility now treats sewage flows exceeding the capacity of the present Tijuana sewage treatment system. The plant directly assists in the restoration of the Tijuana River Valley. Another collaborative effort between the two cities was the environmentally friendly development of paved roads - created by placing concrete blocks on dirt roads - in the San Bernardo neighborhood of northwestern Tijuana. Whilst being a good example for overall development of Tijuana, it served to retain water in the earth and prevented possible negative impacts from floodwater.|$|E

40|$|Environment {{and health}} are {{interlinked}} {{areas that are}} generating increasing interest and relevance in view of achieving a sustainable society. This is the main argument for increased emphasis on <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> issues in science education. However, beyond this foreground goal, environment and health problems provide a background of opportunities {{to ask questions about}} the nature and role of science in society. From a positivist technical perspective, environment and health are well-defined measurable resources or states that can be controlled by well-educated individuals. <b>Environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> education and related research approaches have, for a certain time, followed this line. From a socio-scientific perspective, the potential of <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> issues lies in searching beyond the surface: What notions of environment and health can be identified, how are they represented in society, and how are they represented in science? How do members of society, such as citizens, politicians, and scientists, come to know about what matters in current <b>and</b> future <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> developments? And what concepts do people have about how <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> problems might be approached? Such questions illustrated by examples and related research approaches are challenges for a socio-scientific orientation in science teaching...|$|R
