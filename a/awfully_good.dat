500|$|In September 1976, Alston {{announced}} that he would retire {{at the end of the}} season. At a press conference, Alston said, [...] "I've been in baseball for 41 years and it's been <b>awfully</b> <b>good</b> to me. This has been a pretty big day. I had three birdies playing golf for the first time in my life and now I'm announcing that I'm stepping down as manager. I told Peter this afternoon to give somebody else a chance to manage the club." [...] Alston retired with 2,063 wins (2,040 in the regular season and 23 in the postseason). Alston was named NL Manager of the Year six times. He also managed NL All-Star squads a record nine times and won seven of those games. At a time when multi-year contracts were on the rise, Alston's managerial career consisted of 23 one-year contracts. He earned seven NL pennants in that span.|$|E
2500|$|After filming, further editing was {{undertaken}} at the U.K.'s Twickenham Film Studios, {{with the production}} moving back to the U.S. in November 2010. Kahn also said of {{his work on the}} film: [...] "We put together here in Hollywood. It worked well ... Those English actors are <b>awfully</b> <b>good</b> and so were the horses. The horses were beautifully trained. For an editor {{there were a lot of}} match [...] problems with the horses but the shooting was so good that I got everything I needed.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I like it, your talent; I measure it, I {{appreciate}} it, I {{insist upon}} it," [...] that critic went {{on between the}} whiffs of his cigarette. [...] "I have to be <b>awfully</b> wise and <b>good</b> to do so, but fortunately I am. In such a case that's my duty. I shall make you my business for a while. Therefore," [...] he added piously; [...] "don't say I'm unconscious of the moral law." ...|$|R
5000|$|Elgar {{said of the}} Violin Concerto, [...] "It's <b>good!</b> <b>awfully</b> emotional! too emotional, but I love it." [...] Like {{the vast}} {{majority}} of earlier violin concertos, Elgar's has three movements. The Elgar biographer Michael Kennedy suggests that structurally the concerto is modelled on those by Brahms and perhaps Bruch. It is on a very large scale for a concerto, typically taking between 45 and 55 minutes to perform (see [...] "Recordings" [...] below for indicative timings).|$|R
2500|$|This most {{eccentric}} and haunting {{of modern}} epics {{is driven by}} oilman Daniel Plainview, who, {{in the hands of}} actor Daniel Day-Lewis, becomes a Horatio Alger story gone horribly wrong. Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's camera is as crucial to the films hypnotic pull as the performance at its center. For its evocation of the early 1900s, its relentless focus on one man's fascinating obsessions, and for its inspiring example of how to freely adapt a novel—plus, what I think is the performance of the new century—There Will Be Blood stands alone. The more I see it, the sadder, and stranger, and more visually astounding it grows—and the more it seems to say about the best and worst in the American ethos of rugged individualism. <b>Awfully</b> <b>good!</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{guests at}} the hotel {{typically}} are comic foils to Basil's anger and outbursts. Guest characters in each episode provide different characteristics (working class, promiscuous, foreign) that he cannot stand. Requests both reasonable and impossible test his temper. Even the afflicted annoy him, as for example in the episode [...] "Communication Problems", revolving around the havoc caused by the frequent misunderstandings between the staff and the hard-of-hearing Mrs. Richards. By the end, Basil faints just {{at the mention of}} her name. This episode is typical of the show's careful weaving of humorous situations through comedy cross-talk. The show also uses mild black humour at times, notably when Basil is forced to hide a dead body and in Basil's comments about Sybil ("Did you ever see that film, How to Murder Your Wife? ... <b>Awfully</b> <b>good.</b> I saw it six times.") and to the guests ("May I suggest that you consider moving to a hotel closer to the sea? Or preferably in it.").|$|E
2500|$|Grossmith then {{returned}} to Edwardes's company as leading comedian, touring in Kitty Grey, and then starred in the Gaiety Theatre's hit The Toreador (1901). [...] Grossmith supplied {{some of his own}} lyrics ("Archie") but scored his biggest hit with Rubens's song [...] "Everybody's <b>Awfully</b> <b>Good</b> to Me." [...] He then played in The School Girl (1903) and subsequently toured America in the piece, but he mostly remained at the Gaiety for the next dozen years, starring in a number of hits and becoming one of the biggest stars of the Edwardian era. His roles in these hits included The Hon. Guy Scrymgeour in The Orchid (1903), Gustave Babori in The Spring Chicken (1905), Genie of The Lamp in The New Aladdin (1906), Otto, the prince, in The Girls of Gottenberg (1907), Hughie in Our Miss Gibbs (1909), Auberon Blowand in Peggy (1911) and Lord Bicester in The Sunshine Girl (1912). He often performed together with diminutive comic Edmund Payne.|$|E

"Yes," [...] he continued, comfortably {{filling his}} pipe, [...] "the daughter, Miss Kirkby, was <b>awfully</b> <b>good</b> fun; so fresh, so {{perfectly}} natural and innocent, don't you know, {{and yet so}} extraordinarily sharp and clever. She had some <b>awfully</b> <b>good</b> chaff over that Scotch scenery before those Scotch tourists, do you remember? And {{it was all so}} beastly true, too. Perhaps she's with you here?" ...|$|E
