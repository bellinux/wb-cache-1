25|$|The British Rallycross Grand Prix {{has come}} and gone in recent years, but none of the modern incarnations have come close to the 'real' Grand Prix, the {{versions}} of the event run at Brands Hatch between 1982 and 1994. The Rallycross Grand Prix was, in essence, an open-house, end of season, free for all. If you had a Rallycross car and fancied racing in the Grand Prix, you could make your entry and have a go. This led to some wonderful events and the chance to see unusual cars and star drivers; Denis Marcel's beautiful Matra Murena, unlikely and surprisingly fast NSUs from Norway, Stig Blomqvist wheeling out his privately owned Audi Quattro, sportscar ace Cor Euser doing <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> in a MG Metro 6R4, etc. The Grand Prix was different; it stood out from the crowd and appealed to competitors because it wasn’t just another event. Being Brands Hatch helped, geographically it was good and the circuit put all of its marketing and PR effort into making something of the event.|$|E
25|$|Horn {{allegedly}} {{killed his}} first {{man in a}} duel— a second lieutenant in the Mexican Army, whom he killed {{as a result of}} a dispute with a prostitute. At sixteen, Horn headed to the American Southwest, where he was hired by the U.S. Cavalry as a civilian scout, packer and interpreter under Al Sieber during the Apache Wars. Horn did <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> in his work for the army, and soon he rose through the ranks. In one instance, as Sieber, Horn, and the army were crossing the Cibicue Creek, they were ambushed by Apaches warriors positioned on high ground. The officer in charge of their squad, Captain Edmund Hentig, was instantly killed, and the men became pinned down under overwhelming fire. Desperate, Sieber ordered Horn and another scout, Mickey Free, to break away and return fire from a hill. Together with the soldiers, the men managed to repel the attack. Tom Horn and Al Sieber participated during the Battle of Big Dry Wash, and gained recognition when he and Lt. George H. Morgan slipped through the banks opposite of the Apache line, and provided covering fire for the cavalry as well as killing a number of Apaches warriors.|$|E

[...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "Anytime that Jimmie is down is not usually because of performance, it's usually because of an incident like last week. There was {{no doubt in my mind}} they were going to come this week and make a statement.

5000|$|Edwin A. Locke’s goal theory {{describes}} setting {{more specific}} goals to elicit higher performance and setting more difficult goals to increase effort. [...] He also believed that, through employee participation in goal setting the employees {{would be more}} likely to accept the goals and have <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction. [...] The goal theory’s underlying assumption is that employees who participate in goal setting will set more difficult goals for themselves and yield superior performance. [...] The theory is logical because employees are going to set more difficult goals but the goals will be attainable with increased effort. Sometimes organizations set goals that their employees will rarely, if ever, be able to meet. If the goals are always unattainable, there is no motivation to try accomplishing them.|$|R

Neither GE nor Alstom confirmed the report. On 27 April Le Figaro reported that an alternative offer of a cash plus asset swap had been made by Siemens. The bid {{was reported}} to involve Siemens acquiring Alstom's power business in exchange for part of its rail transport arm, plus a cash offer as good as GE's and various job guarantees. [...] The Siemens deal was reported as being promoted by French economic minister Arnaud Montebourg. However, the Siemens' and Alstom's companies' product overlap was <b>greater,</b> representing <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>jobs</b> risk, and had potential issues with European competition regulators.

[...] Jason Klein of Variety declared that DAR-Film Leaderboard was notably absent of Oscar-nominated films, but part of the gap was filled by Neerja. Sonali Kokra of The National praised the film: [...] "Neerja is a great story told well.
