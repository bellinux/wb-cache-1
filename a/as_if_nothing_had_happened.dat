If a customer used the phrase [...] "I come from Rothenburg", she was instructed to show him the book, allow him make his decision and call for the girl he had selected.

500|$|The {{theater was}} opened and {{dedicated}} on January 2, 1917. The first concert {{took place on}} July 30, 1916, and was by Ignacy Jan Paderewski. During his performance, the Black Tom explosion took place at a munitions works in New Jersey, more than [...] from Scarborough. Frank Vanderlip Jr., ten {{years old at the}} time, later recalled that he saw the detonation shake the jammed theater building, and that Paderewski had played on <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> The automatic fire doors {{at the top of the}} theater had sprung open, and two men were sent aloft to sit on them until the end of the performance to prevent a cold draft from entering the room.|$|E

500|$|The {{murder of}} {{the heir to the}} Austro-Hungarian Empire and his wife {{produced}} widespread shock across European royal houses, and there was initially much sympathy for the Austrian position. Ordinary people did not really care about what happened, and on the evening of the assassination the crowds in Vienna listened to music and drank wine, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened..</b> Within two days of the assassination, Austria-Hungary and Germany advised Serbia that it should open an investigation, but Secretary General to the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Slavko Gruic, replied [...] "Nothing had been done so far and the matter did not concern the Serbian Government." [...] An angry exchange followed between the Austrian Chargé d'Affaires at Belgrade and Gruic.|$|E
500|$|Tokyo {{during the}} Meiji period (1868–1912) {{had a great}} {{openness}} to foreign—especially European—influence, and Western trends in art were quickly replacing traditional Japanese ones until word spread of the impact exported ukiyo-e had had on art in the West. [...] Artists who had all but abandoned {{the culture of the}} Edo period began to reconsider it and mix elements of it with Western approaches. [...] Kanae took part in meetings of the Pan no Kai group of writers and artists whose goal was to replicate the atmosphere of Parisian cafés such as Café Guerbois of the Impressionists. [...] At one of these rowdy bohemian meetings, a drunken Kanae fell through a window and landed in the garden below, wrapped in a [...] paper screen; he returned to the gathering <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> [...] The police kept watch over these meetings whose members they suspected of having socialist sympathies and held grudges over caricatures some of the members had published. [...] Pan no Kai waned and came to and end in 1911.|$|E
500|$|Kahn {{proposed}} a structure within a structure, monumental [...] "pylons of Jerusalem stone {{on each side}} enclosing four huge central pillars of reinforced concrete, so that the pylons function as a container and the pillars as its content". Following the Beaux-Arts tradition, the elements of architecture were conceived as hollow, thus creating pocketing spaces within both structures. The outer structure was composed of 16 piers covered in golden Jerusalem stone cut in blocks of the same proportions and same course finish {{as those of the}} Western Wall. In the bases of the four corners of the two-story, [...] high structure delineated by the piers, there would be small alcoves for meditation or individual prayer. Such alcoves would be used for daily prayer services, allowing larger crowds on Sabbath or festivals. Boston-based architect Moshe Safdie, who had built extensively in Jerusalem and trained with Kahn in Philadelphia, was also in favour of rebuilding using contemporary design: [...] "It's absurd to reconstruct the Hurva <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> If we have the desire to rebuild it, let's have the courage to have a great architect do it." ...|$|E

500|$|Calgary Sun {{columnist}} Eric Francis called McMahon's {{decision to}} continue the event [...] "sick, disrespectful and wrong. But what else would you expect from the WWF?" [...] He added, [...] "if there's any justice in this world, McMahon will pay dearly for what his organization has done to further pain the Harts". Some fans were also upset with the decision to carry on with the show. One man, who left the event with his children upon hearing that Hart had died, claimed, [...] "It was disgusting.... For kids to see that, {{for this to be}} so-called family entertainment, for them to just carry on <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> is just sad." [...] Martha Hart, Owen's wife, refused to criticize McMahon publicly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} her husband's death. She said that McMahon [...] "absolutely should be there" [...] at the funeral. She also stated, [...] "I'm a very forgiving person and I'm not bitter or angry, but there will be a day of reckoning". Commenting on the WWF's decision {{to continue the}} show after her husband's death, Martha stated, [...] "After he lost his fight for life they just scooped him up and ordered the next match out. Where's the humanity? Would he have wanted the show to go on? Absolutely not." ...|$|E
500|$|Nosanchuk {{gave his}} final {{statement}} to the court first. Speaking for the defence, he reminded the jury {{that every one of}} the doctors speaking on Lamb's behalf had originally been engaged by the state and that Yaworsky was the only one not employed in the public sector. He conceded that the defendant's actions were senseless and violent, but stressed that if found {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, Lamb would stay in custody and could be kept in psychiatric care for the rest of his life if necessary. He argued that Lamb's actions on the evening of 25 June 1966 clearly made no sense and asked the jury to carefully consider them: the victims were not known to Lamb; Lamb made no attempt to disguise himself; Lamb acted alone; Lamb had nothing to gain from the act; Lamb inexplicably diverted his fire from the original group to a shadow in a doorway; Lamb then chose another house at random and threatened to kill the occupant, then left without doing anything; Lamb made no attempt to hide the weapon, leaving it in a nearby field where it would surely be found; then, finally, the boy simply went home to bed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Was this, Nosanchuk asked, the behaviour of a premeditated killer, or of a profoundly disturbed young man who did not appreciate what he was doing? ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Revenge" [...] {{was written}} by series co-creator Larry David and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. All prior Seinfeld episodes were co-written by Seinfeld and David. The Revenge is the first episode written by David alone, though Seinfeld did proofread the script and would {{continue to do so}} for all scripts up to the eighth season. George's storyline in the episode is based on David's own experiences while a writer at Saturday Night Live. David had quit SNL halfway through the 1984-1985 television season, but felt he had made a mistake once he reached his home. His neighbor Kenny Kramer, who later served as the main inspiration for Kramer, suggested David return to work the following Monday and act <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Unlike George Costanza, the ploy succeeded for David, who remained with SNLs writing staff until the end of that season. George's reason for quitting was inspired by Seinfeld writer Larry Charles' use of the private restroom in Seinfeld and David's office instead of the public one. The Newman sub plot was inspired by one of David's neighbors, who once jumped from {{the second floor of the}} apartment building in which they both lived. The unseen character Mr. Papanickolas, who is mentioned by Kramer, was named after Pete Papanickolas, a member of the production crew.|$|E

500|$|Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{said that}} the scene where Santana comes out to her {{grandmother}} only to be rejected was a [...] "powerful moment and Rivera delivered in a way equal to Chris Colfer and Mike O'Malley's scenes during Kurt's coming out". Bell also complimented the sequence, though she criticized the next scene for showing [...] "a happy, smiling Santana" [...] with no further explanation, and Canning and Kubicek were also unhappy with her abrupt change in mood, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> VanDerWerff, though he called the coming-out scene [...] "a moment that's played {{with a sort of}} bracing honesty and moving empathy" [...] for what Santana was going through, stated that the [...] "Santana storyline {{has been one of the}} best things about the back half of season two and this front half of season three, and the scenes that should be its emotional crux are occurring in our imaginations", such as when she comes out to her parents. Goldberg called the fact that Finn suffered no consequences for his outing of Santana [...] "a missed opportunity". Bell, however, thought that his telling Santana that [...] "he cares about her and doesn't want her to hold her feelings for women in anymore" [...] was [...] "one of the most touching scenes of the series", though Kubicek characterized Finn's statement that he cared for her because Santana [...] "was his first" [...] as creepy. MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan derided the choice to perform [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] as [...] "poor comprehension of song lyrics", since Santana [...] "is a lesbian and not just [...] drunk girl who kissed another girl after drinking". VanDerWerff wondered why Santana was so happy during the song, since she had just experienced [...] "the sort of outrageous bigotry she'll have to put up with for the rest of her life".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the court}} intrigue, and plots, Salazar {{returned}} to the Spanish court, was reappointed, and returned to New Spain in 1540. He completed his position as factor in New Spain without issue. Salazar behaved <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Dubbed [...] "el gordo" [...] behind his back, he was overly courteous and courtly. A sinister persona, he left politics thereafter, and lived comfortably until his death probably in 1564.|$|E

2500|$|A stay at Vilina Vlas {{during a}} visit to Višegrad {{inspired}} the Australian performance artist Kym Vercoe's work [...] "seven kilometres north-east: A performance about geography, tourism and atrocity". In 2013 a film by Jasmila Žbanić and Kym Vercoe For Those Who Can Tell No Tales was released. It shows how the horrific crimes committed against women in Vilina Vlas are being swept under the carpet even today, as the perpetrators remain unpunished and the hotel operates <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In April 1925, the Duke {{suffered}} a stroke that paralysed him and led to his gradual mental deterioration. Previously a jovial man, the duke became miserable towards his family and others, and suddenly could not tolerate his wife. Their granddaughter-in-law later recalled that [...] "Granny Evie tried to carry on <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> but the house and estate lacked a leader and it showed." [...] The Duchess gained more authority over his estates, destroying its Joseph Paxton-designed conservatory and saving expenses by introducing nettle soup to Chatsworth House, but their affairs [...] "gradually went downhill." [...] He died in May 1938; after his death, the Duchess took up residence at Hardwick Hall, where she oversaw {{a significant amount of}} repair work of its tapestries and embroideries.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, {{the public}} and {{authorities}} did not know these connections. Buscetta only revealed facts about the relations between mafiosi and politicians after judge Giovanni Falcone was killed in 1992. However, already in 1964 one of Falcone’s predecessors, judge Cesare Terranova, unequivocally demonstrated Lima’s connections with the La Barberas. In an indictment in 1964, Terranova wrote: [...] "it is clear that Angelo and Salvatore La Barbera (well-known bosses in the Palermo area) ... knew former mayor Salvatore Lima and maintained relations {{in such a way}} as to ask for favours. ... The undeniable contacts of the La Barbera mafiosi with the one who was the first citizen of Palermo ... constitute a confirmation of ... the infiltration of the Mafia in several sectors of public life." [...] Nevertheless, Lima was allowed to continue in politics <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Sothern {{became popular}} with Robertson's crowd, {{including}} with the Haymarket's manager, John Baldwin Buckstone, actor J. L. Toole, and dramatists Byron and W. S. Gilbert, who later wrote three plays for him, Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith (1876), The Ne'er-do-Weel (1878), and Foggerty's Fairy (1881). [...] He {{was known as}} a sportsman and bon vivant and became famous for his magic tricks, conversation and, especially, his practical jokes (he was born on April fool's day). [...] Sothern and his friends demanded that clerks sell them goods not carried by the store in question, staged mock arguments on public omnibuses, ran fake advertisements in newspapers, paid street urchins to annoy passers-by and so forth. [...] At one restaurant, Toole and Sothern removed the silver and hid under the table. [...] When the unfortunate waiter found the dining room empty and the silver gone, he ran to report the theft. [...] By the time he returned, Toole and Sothern had re-set the table <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E
2500|$|During the band's early years, {{despite being}} the singer, bassist and chief songwriter, Lynott was still fairly {{reserved}} and introverted on stage, and would stand {{to one side}} while the spotlight concentrated on Bell, who was initially regarded as the group's leader. During the recording of the band's second album, Shades of a Blue Orphanage (1972), Lynott very nearly left Thin Lizzy {{to form a new}} band with Deep Purple's Ritchie Blackmore and Ian Paice, called Baby Face. [...] "Ritchie turned up in the studio one day to jam," [...] recalled Brian Downey. [...] "I was asked to play drums to Phil and Ritchie jamming… Me and Eric looked at each other like, 'Well, that's the end of the band then.' It lasted a week, then Phil came back <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> He wanted to be the leader of his own band, not the singer in someone else's." [...] Due to being in dire financial straits, Lizzy did, however, soon record an album of Deep Purple covers under the name Funky Junction. Lynott did not sing on the album as he felt his voice was not in the same style as Ian Gillan.|$|E
