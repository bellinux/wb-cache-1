25|$|<b>Adamantane</b> cages can be stacked {{together}} to produce higher diamondoids, such as diamantane (C14H20 – two fused <b>adamantane</b> cages), triamantane (C18H24), tetramantane (C22H28), pentamantane (C26H32), hexamantane (C26H30), etc. Their synthesis {{is similar to}} that of <b>adamantane</b> and like <b>adamantane,</b> they can also be extracted from petroleum, though at even much smaller yields.|$|R
5000|$|Currently, {{there are}} two classes of {{antiviral}} drugs approved for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza infections. They are the <b>adamantanes</b> and NAIs. The <b>adamantanes</b> only work on influenza A so since 2010 WHO recommended the usage of NAIs for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B infections. In contrast to <b>adamantanes,</b> NAIs are less toxic and less prone to promote drug-resistant influenza. Moreover, they are effective against all neuraminidase subtypes and all strains of influenza. After the influenza pandemic in 2009, there has been great concern about viral resistance to NAIs. Influenza viruses that have reduced sensitivity to NAIs often contain mutation that affect {{the shape of the}} NA catalytic site and therefore reduce the binding ability of the inhibitors. The catalytic site of the NA has eight functional residues ( [...] R118, D151, R152, R224, E276, R292, R371, and Y406) surrounded by eleven framework residues (E119, R156, W178, S179, D198, I222, E227, H274, E277, N294, and E425).|$|E

25|$|All medical {{applications}} known so far involve not pure <b>adamantane,</b> but its derivatives. The first <b>adamantane</b> derivative {{used as a}} drug was amantadine – first (1967) as an antiviral drug against various strains of flu and then to treat Parkinson's disease. Other drugs among <b>adamantane</b> derivatives include adapalene, adapromine, amantadine, bromantane, carmantadine, chlodantane, dopamantine, memantine, rimantadine, saxagliptin, tromantadine, and vildagliptin.

50|$|Diamantane occurs {{naturally}} in crude petroleum.

25|$|The first {{attempted}} laboratory synthesis {{was made}} in 1924 by German chemist Hans Meerwein using the reaction of formaldehyde with diethyl malonate {{in the presence of}} piperidine.

Later, another German chemist D. Bottger tried to obtain <b>adamantane</b> using Meerwein's ester as precursor. However, the product, tricyclo- decane ring system, was again an <b>adamantane</b> derivative.|$|R

5000|$|With the {{knowledge}} of the dopaminergic psychostimulant effects of the adamantane derivatives, bromantane, which is 2-(4-bromophenylamino)adamantane, was developed in the 1980s at the Zakusov State Institute of Pharmacology, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences in Moscow as [...] "a drug having psychoactivating and adaptogen properties under complicated conditions (hypoxia, high environmental temperature, physical overfatigue, emotional stress, etc.)". It was found to produce more marked and prolonged psychostimulant effects than the other <b>adamantanes,</b> and eventually entered use. The drug was notably given to soldiers in the Soviet and Russian militaries to [...] "shorten recovery times after strong physical exertion". After the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, bromantane continued to be researched and characterized but was mainly limited in use to sports medicine (for instance, to enhance athletic performance). In 1996, it was encountered as a doping agent in the 1996 Summer Olympics when several Russian athletes tested positive for it, and was subsequently placed on the World Anti-Doping Agency banned list in 1997 as a stimulant and masking agent. Bromantane was eventually repurposed in 2005 as a treatment for neurasthenia. It demonstrated effectiveness and safety for the treatment of the condition in extensive, including large-scale clinical trials, and was approved for this indication in Russia sometime around 2009.|$|E
