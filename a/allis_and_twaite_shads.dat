40|$|Abstract: River Mondego is {{the largest}} Portuguese river with its basin entirely within {{national}} territory. The Açude-Ponte dam was built in Mondego in the 80 ’s, along with three other large dams to mitigate floods and to allow the integrated use of river basin water resources for hydroelectric power generation, public supply, industry and irrigation. Considering the river importance for several fish species, namely sea-lamprey and shad, a fishway was constructed. Several structural and hydraulic problems soon revealed that this fishway was inefficient therefore this dam became the first impassable obstacle in the River Mondego. In 2011, {{after several years of}} biological and hydraulic monitoring, and once the reasons for the fishway inefficiency were perfectly identified, a vertical-slot fishway was built to restore river connectivity. The efficiency and effectiveness of the Coimbra Fishway has been studied since 2012 using several monitoring techniques (visual counts, biotelemetry techniques and CPUE abundance with electrofishing). Monitoring results show that several autochthonous species use the fishway, including the diadromous sea-lamprey, <b>allis</b> <b>and</b> <b>twaite</b> shad <b>and</b> European-eel. More than 1, 500. 000 fish have used the fishway during the upstream or downstream migration. PIT telemetry has shown an efficiency of 30 % for Petromyzon marinus and 14 % for Luciobarbus bocagei. Pre and post fishway construction electrofishing monitoring shows improvements in sealamprey larvae abundance both upstream and downstream from the Açude-Ponte dam. Coimbra Fishway project is improving fish migration in River Mondego, but it’s also an integrated project involving other important aspects such as fisheries and river basin management and environmental education. Changes in exploitation regimes of upstream hydropower dams and in the Açude-Ponte are also planned to increase the fishway efficiency. Finally, several activities have been carried out in association with this project to raise public awareness regarding environmental issues, particularly those related with river longitudinal continuity...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} past, {{present and future}} of eight {{anadromous}} fish species inhabiting the Lower Rhine (The Netherlands), viz. -sturgeon (Acipenser sturio), whitefish and houting (Coregonus lavaretus, C. oxyrinchus), smelt (Osmerus eperlanus), <b>allis</b> <b>and</b> <b>twaite</b> shad (Alosa alosa, A. fallax), sea trout (Salmo trutta) and salmon (Salmo salar). All species are under threat or became extinct (e. g. sturgeon, allis shad). It {{is not possible to}} single out a specific factor for the decline or disappearance. A combination of factors is responsible, as the degradation of the spawning and nursery areas, river correction for shipping, building of sluices and hydropower dams, extraction of sand and gravel and river pollution. The likelihood that a species will return via natural recovery, or restocking is assessed. The return of the sturgeon is unlikely. Present observations of sturgeon can be attributed to releases of unwanted sturgeon hybrids. A natural stock of coregonids in Dutch waters seems not feasible any more due to irreversible habitat degradation. Present day catches originate from German releases. The anadromous smelt, heavily reduced in numbers, still inhabits some of our waters, the non-migratory smelt is still very common. The allis shad is extinct and unlikely to recover. The species never spawned in the Dutch part of the Rhine. Twaite shad, declining in numbers, are still observed in the lower reaches of Rhine and Meuse. Sea trout is presumably still present in the same varying numbers as before. Spawning in our waters has not been documented. The salmon, once fished in large numbers, is now the subject of restocking programmes in Germany. Observations of individuals can partly be attributed to these programmes but also to straying salmon. Restocking programmes should be considerably improved before noticeable success is to be met...|$|R
40|$|Tese dout., Ecologia, Universidade do Algarve, 2006 <b>Allis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Twaite</b> shad Alosa spp. are {{anadromous}} clupeid species, {{which still}} migrate into several rivers along Portugal to spawn but {{are regarded as}} Endangered or Vulnerable (using IUCN criteria). Within {{the framework of a}} countrywide research project, this dissertation reports the work carried out (from February 1998 until July 2000) to study the biology and ecology of the early life-history stages of Twaite shad, Alosa fallax fallax, in the River Mira (with a final note on Alosa spp. in the River Guadiana). Twaite shad larvae were more abundant in the surface waters during the day whereas no diel abundance pattern was observed for embryos (i. e. yolk-sac larvae). Furthermore, eggs, embryos and larvae were only found in the upstream stations of River Mira from late-March until mid- June. As expected, no habitat selection occurs at either the egg or embryonic life stages. Conversely, shad larvae abundances were related to several environmental co-variates through a complex non-linear generalised additive model (GAM). Paired translucent and opaque rings in a regularly-recurring sequence deposited around the sagittae of A. fallax fallax were readily visible. The high proportion of sagittae used suggests the usefulness of otolith microstructural analysis to estimate age and to study growth and morality of larvae. Growth and mortality rates varied seasonally (ranging from 0. 36 to 0. 60 mm d - 1 and from 16 to 30 % d - 1, respectively). In a typical year, larvae are in better nutritional condition (RNA/DNA ratio) during two relatively short time-periods, around mid-April and mid to late?May when water temperatures average 22 ?C and levels of prey are 20 nauplii 100 m - 3). The few occurrences of Alosa spp. embryos and larvae in the River Guadiana and the tributary Ribeira de Odeleite precluded sensible analysis. Future topics of research to clarify some issues or directed at unanswered questions are proposed...|$|R

40|$|The Severn Estuary is {{the second}} largest estuary in the UK and has been {{designated}} a cSAC because it contains habitat types and species that are rare or threatened in Europe, including the anadromous river and sea lampreys <b>and</b> the <b>twaite</b> <b>and</b> <b>allis</b> <b>shads.</b> Extensive intertidal mud and sandflats support vast numbers of benthic invertebrates, fish and internationally important populations of wading birds. More than a hundred species of fish have been identified from the Severn Estuary and its seaward extension, the Bristol Channel. Most of {{our knowledge of the}} estuary’s fish community comes from individuals entrained on the cooling water-intake screens used at power stations sited along the English and Welsh shores. Fish abundance at Hinkley Point power station situated at the seaward margin of the estuary in Bridgewater Bay, has been monitored for more than 25 years and similar records are available from Oldbury power station from the 1970 s and 1990 s. These data have been used to describe the biology and ecology of the more abundant species of fish and crustaceans in the estuary. Power station samples have enabled factors that affect seasonal and annual variations in the abundance of individual species to be elucidated. The pattern of fish abundance that emerges is one in which sequential waves of different species enter the estuary at specific times of year. These seasonal changes in the fish assemblage are remarkably consistent, but the abundance of individual species can fluctuate markedly from year to year depending on breeding success, juvenile recruitment, changing temperatures, salinity and freshwater discharge. The most abundant species of fish consist primarily of the juveniles of marine species that utilise the estuary as a nursery that are termed marine estuarine-opportunists. Other life-cycle categories include marine stragglers and freshwater species that occasionally stray into estuarine waters, and anadromous and catadromous species that use the estuary as a migratory corridor. The report reviews the biology and ecology of 27 species that are dependant on the estuary for at least some part of their life-cycle and considers factors affecting their seasonal abundance, growth, behaviour and conservation status. Possible reasons for the marked increase in fish abundance that has occurred gradually since the 1970 s and more rapidly since 2002 are discussed. The fact that sediment and water quality in the estuary has improved, particularly with regard to heavy metal contamination, may partly explain the increase in fish numbers, but increases in water temperature linked to climate change are likely to be very significant. Other factors that may adversely affect the fish community and threaten its stability include the proposal to construct a barrage across the estuary that will affect the distribution of sediment and interfere with the migratory activity of protected species. Of particular concern is the potential for turbine-induced mortality that is likely to be very significant for some migratory species and also for those marine estuarine-opportunists that show seasonal movements {{in and out of the}} estuary. The report concludes by summarising the health of the estuarine fish assemblage and makes recommendations for its future management and conservation...|$|R

Therefore, some extra premise must be introduced in order to say anything about the state of the jar at t = 1. <b>Allis</b> <b>and</b> Koetsier believe such an extra premise can be provided by the physical law that the marbles have continuous space-time paths, and therefore from the fact that for each n, marble n is out of the jar for t < 1, it must follow that it must still be outside the jar at t = 1 by continuity. Thus, the contradiction, and the paradox, remains.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, {{there has been a}} marked {{decline in the number of}} shad (Alosa alosa and A. fallax) landed in France, which {{prompted}} the French committee of the International Union for Conservation of Nature to list shad as a ‘Vulnerable’ species in 2010. The freshwater phases of shad life cycles have been extensively studied, but the marine phases remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to provide new insights into shad ecology by describing the marine distributions of <b>twaite</b> <b>and</b> <b>allis</b> shad using a presence/absence model based on bycatch data from commercial fishery surveys. Depth and salinity were identified as the main factors influencing shad distribution. Both species were primarily located in shallow areas, at depths of between 0 and 100 m. As expected for anadromous species, low-salinity areas were preferred. Substrate and latitude played minor roles in the observed distribution of shad. Our results suggest that latitudinal migration between winter and summer habitats does not occur in <b>twaite</b> <b>and</b> <b>allis</b> shad populations. Furthermore, substrate does not appear to be a key factor contributing to shad distribution. A better understanding of the distribution of shad species throughout their life cycles, particularly in the open sea where they are vulnerable to bycatch, would help in the selection of key protected areas for the sustainability of shad populations...|$|R
