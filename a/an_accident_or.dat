5|$|An away team boards the cube, {{discovering}} that either <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> <b>or</b> another species disabled the vessel. They take a Borg drone back onto Voyager, where the Doctor (Robert Picardo) accidentally revives it. After {{being told by}} Frazier to remain where he is, Chakotay breaks {{out of his room}} where he sees that all the people around him on the alien planet possess Borg implant technology in their bodies. Frazier explains that an electro-kinetic storm broke their link with the Borg hive mind. Instead, the separated drones settled on a nearby planet. Chakotay's health gets worse, and the ex-Borg offer to connect him to a joint mind to heal his injuries, and he reluctantly accepts. Once part of the hive mind, he sees a montage of their memories. After Voyager arrives, Frazier and her group want Janeway to re-activate the neuroelectric generator on the damaged cube to extend a new joint mind across the entire planet.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> (<b>or</b> sabotage), it is {{expected}} that a fusion reactor would release far less radioactive pollution than would an ordinary fission nuclear station.

Proponents note that large-scale fusion power would be able to produce reliable electricity on demand, and with virtually zero pollution (no gaseous CO2, SO2, or NOx by-products are produced).|$|E
25|$|The Motor Car Act 1903, {{which came}} into force on 1 January 1904, {{required}} all motor vehicles to be entered on an official vehicle register, and to carry alphanumeric plates.

Vehicle registration alphanumeric plates in the UK are rectangular or square in shape, with the exact permitted dimensions of the plate and its lettering set down in law.

All {{other kinds of}} blue lights (e.g. car floor lighting or cab interior lights) are illegal on public roads. Flashing blue lights and sirens may only be used by authorized vehicles in case of {{emergency and}} order all other vehicles to make way, since these vehicles have the absolute right of way. Blue lights alone {{may be used to}} secure the site of <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> (<b>or</b> a standing emergency vehicle). Sometimes, columns of emergency or police vehicles use blue lights (without sirens) to make the column more visible to other vehicles.|$|E
25|$|After {{making a}} {{television}} production: La Matiouette ou l'arrière-pays, (1983), Téchiné returned to critical attention with Rendez-vous (1985), a sexy noir melodrama replete with the seductive {{surface of the}} era. In the film a would-be actress, Nina, fleeing her provincial home for Paris, enters a turbulent love relationship with a sadistic, self-destructive young actor, who caused {{the death of his}} former girlfriend. When the actor himself is killed in <b>an</b> <b>accident,</b> <b>or</b> possible suicide, his former mentor/director, and father of the dead girlfriend, determines to cast the inexperienced Nina as the female lead in 'Romeo and Juliet', a role his deceased daughter played. The film is ultimately a vehicle for exploring the violent intensity of certain emotional attachments and their ability to cause one's life to spin off in unexpected directions. By now a key director of the post-New Wave, this film earned Téchiné the Cannes Festival Best Direction Award while helping launch the career of Juliette Binoche.|$|E
25|$|Title {{insurance}} differs {{in several}} respects from {{other types of}} insurance. Where most insurance is a contract where the insurer indemnifies or guarantees another party against a possible specific type of loss (such as <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> <b>or</b> death) at a future date, title insurance generally insures against losses caused by title problems that have their source in past events. This often results in the curing of title defects or the elimination of adverse interests from the title before a transaction takes place. Title insurance companies attempt to achieve this by searching public records to develop and document the chain of title and to detect known claims against or defects in the title to the subject property. If liens or encumbrances are found, the insurer may require that steps be taken to eliminate them (for example, obtaining a release of an old mortgage or deed of trust that has been paid off, or requiring the payoff, or satisfying involuntary liens such as abstracts of judgment and tax liens) before issuing the title policy. In the alternative, it may except from the policy's coverage those items not eliminated. Title plants are sometimes maintained to index the public records geographically, {{with the goal of}} increasing searching efficiency and reducing claims. In some states title plants are required to index the real-property records geographically and also maintain a name file for judgments, probates and other general matters.|$|E

500|$|The third, {{underlying}} {{theme of}} death is also portrayed. Unlike most young people, the Bechdel children have a tangible relationship with death because of the family mortuary business.

[...] Whether this was because of his own sexuality, Alison's sexuality, or some other cause remains unclear.|$|E
