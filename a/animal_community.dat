5|$|Level Mountain can be ecologically {{divided into}} three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a largely {{destroyed}} Abies lasiocarpa forest on its flanks and a Picea glauca forest at its base. An extensive wild <b>animal</b> <b>community</b> once thrived {{in the area of}} Level Mountain. This included a wide range of animal species with caribou being the most abundant. Humans had arrived at Level Mountain by the early 1900s, followed by geological studies of the massif in the 1920s. This remote area of Cassiar Land District has a relatively dry environment compared to the Coast Mountains in the west.|$|E
5|$|The {{group of}} animals most {{integral}} to the overall success of Everglades wildlife is freshwater fish. Few places in the Everglades stay submerged {{from one year to}} the next, so alligator holes and deep clefts in the limestone are vital to the survival of fish, and the <b>animal</b> <b>community</b> as a whole. Freshwater fish are the main diet of most wading birds, alligators, and otters, and require large areas of open water in order to repopulate. Young amphibians also {{play an important role in}} the food chain. Tadpoles spread quickly in isolated areas where fish do not have the time or access to reproduce in numbers necessary to support larger animals. Hundreds of species of amphibians are found in the Everglades, and their availability helps support wildlife during short hydroperiods or in remote locations.|$|E

Lake Erie, which surrounds the park, is the first zone and is home to 80 species of fish and at least six species of crustaceans.|$|E
500|$|Chief among Burroughs' {{complaints}} was Long's {{questioning of}} the role of instinct in animal learning, something that Burroughs and many scientists of the day accepted without doubt. Long had written that after many years of studying wild animals, he was [...] "convinced that instinct plays a much smaller part than we have supposed; that an animal's success or failure in the ceaseless struggle for life depends, not upon instinct, but upon the kind of training which the animal learns from its mother." [...] In reply to this assertion, Burroughs wrote in [...] "Real and Sham Natural History": [...] "The crows do not train their young. They have no fortresses, or schools, or colleges, or examining boards, or diplomas, or medals of honor, or hospitals, or churches, or telephones, or postal deliveries, or anything of the sort. Indeed, the poorest backwoods hamlet has more of the appurtenances of civilization than the best organized crow or other wild <b>animal</b> <b>community</b> in the land!" [...] Burroughs summed up by deeming Long a fraud, stating that his [...] "book reads like that {{of a man who has}} really never been to the woods, but who sits in his study and cooks up these yarns from things he has read in Forest and Stream, or in other sporting journals. Of real observation there is hardly a vestige in his book; of deliberate trifling with natural history there is no end".|$|E

[...] Some examples of this dense forest still stand today at R. B. Winter State Park. The Rapid Run Natural Area is [...] of land set aside [...] "to provide a location for scientific observation of natural systems, to protect an example of a typical and unique plant and <b>animal</b> <b>community,</b> and to protect and outstanding example of natural interest and beauty." [...] This natural area has been largely untouched since it was last logged for timber in 1850. Pileated woodpeckers can be seen in this area. Barred owls also live in the Rapid Run Natural Area. Vernal pools fill each spring to provide water for fairy shrimp, caddis-flies, spotted salamanders, and wood frogs.|$|E
