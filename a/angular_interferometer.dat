40|$|Abstrak : The {{high price}} of machine tools must be {{equalized}} with maximal performance, {{and it needs to}} be proved with several performance tests. The test is not only need to be carried out once as the acceptance test but also need to be carried out periodically, in order to keep the machine on it’s best performance. In this research, machine tools will be tested especially on its accuracy of x-axis direction table movement with laser interferometer. Accuracy of table movement test content with positioning accuracy test, angular movement accuracy test and straightness movement accuracy test. Error in machining center table movement was not an individual error, but it was a result of several errors, such as imperfect component, incorrect assembly of machine tools and error in measuring system. In order to perform effective and efficient diagnoses, homogenenous transformation matrix are used to build the model of table movement error. The model of table movement error are built by applying the concept of five bearing contacts on slide ways. Through this model, the form of wear of both guide ways and ballscrew can be determined by comparing the graphic resulted from modeling with the graphic came from direct measuring with laser interferometer. This research gives the conclusions that the direct measuring for error in straightness movement is close to the model. But on the other side, direct measuring on angular movement error of table still has significant difference from the model. Kata kunci: machining center, <b>angular,</b> <b>interferometer...</b>|$|E

Efficient use of highly diluted apertures for coherent imaging can be done with pupil densification, a technique also called “hyper-telescope imaging”. Although best done with adaptive phasing, concentrating most energy in a dominant interference peak for a rich direct image of a complex source, such imaging is also possible with random phase errors such as caused by turbulent “seeing”, using methods such as speckle imaging which uses several short-exposure images to reconstruct the true image. We have simulated such observations using an aperture which changes through the night, as naturally happens on Earth with fixed grounded mirror elements, and find that reconstructed images of star clusters and ex-tended objects are of high quality.

Inspired by the initial COBE results of an extremely isotropic and homogeneous background, a series of ground- and balloon-based experiments quantified CMB anisotropies on smaller angular scales over the next decade.

In order to explore possible signatures of gas giant planet formation via disk instabilities, we have combined a 3 D, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) radiative transfer code with a 3 D, finite differences hydrodynamical code to model molecular emission lines from the vicinity of a 1. 4 M_J self-gravitating proto-GGP. Here, we explore the properties of rotational transitions of the commonly observed dense gas tracer, HCO+. Our main results are the following: 1. Very high lying HCO+ transitions (e. g. HCO+ J= 7 - 6) can trace dense planet forming clumps around circumstellar disks. Depending on the molecular abundance, the proto-GGP may be directly imageable by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). 2. HCO+ emission lines are heavily self-absorbed through the proto-GGP's dense molecular core. This signature is nearly ubiquitous, and only weakly dependent on assumed HCO+ abundances. The self-absorption features are most pronounced at higher angular resolutions. Dense clumps that are not self-gravitating only show minor self-absorption features. 3. Line temperatures are highest through the proto-GGP at all assumed abundances and inclination angles. Conversely, due to self-absorption in the line, the velocity-integrated intensity may not be.

We conclude that a 300 deg 2 survey is an optimal compromise for a 2 -yr experiment to measure both E and B modes, and that a ground-based polarization experiment can make {{an important contribution to}} B-mode surveys. QUaD can make a high significance measurement of the acoustic peaks in the E-mode spectrum, over a multipole range of 25 < ? < 2500, and will be able to detect the gravitational lensing signal in the B-mode spectrum.

Recent observations with the Cosmic Background Imager operating in the Chilean Andes, the Degree <b>Angular</b> Scale <b>Interferometer</b> operating at the South Pole, and the Very Small Array operating in Tenerife have probed the primary anisotropy over a wide range of angular scales. The advantages of interferometers for microwave background observations of both total intensity and polarized radiation are discussed, and the cosmological results from these three instruments are presented. The results show that, subject to a reasonable value for the Hubble constant, which is degenerate with the geometry in closed models, the geometry of the Universe is flat to high precision (~ 5 %) and the primordial fluctuation spectrum is very close to the scale-invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum. Both of these findings are concordant with inflationary predictions. The results also show that the baryonic matter content is consistent with that found from primordial nucleosynthesis, while the cold dark matter component can account for no more than ~ 40 % of the energy density of the Universe. It is a requirement of these observations, therefore, that ~ 60 % of the energy content of the Universe is not related to matter, either baryonic or nonbaryonic. This dark energy component of the energy density is attributed to a nonzero cosmological constant.

40|$|The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) {{has long}} been {{recognized}} as an astounding {{source of information about}} the early Universe. In this thesis we describe the design, implementation, and first-year results of the Degree <b>Angular</b> Scale <b>Interferometer</b> (DASI), a compact interferometer designed to measure the angular power spectrum of the CMB. We discuss details of the optics, receivers, and power spectrum analysis, including the use of constraint matrices to project out contaminants and test for correlations with diffuse foreground templates. We present a measurement of the CMB angular power spectrum in the multipole range l ≈ 100 - 900 in nine bands. The measured fluctuations have a temperature spectral index of β = - 0. 1 ± 0. 2 (1 σ) consistent with CMB. We find no evidence of foregrounds other than point sources in the data. We detect a first peak in the power spectrum at l 200, a second peak in the power spectrum at l 550, and a rise in the power spectrum at l 800 which is indicative of a third, consistent with inflationary theories. Using the DASI measurement along with COBE DMR data, and adopting conservative priors on the Hubble parameter h > 0. 45 and an optical depth due to reionization 0. 0 ≤ τ_c ≤ 0. 4, we constrain the total density of the Universe Ω_(tot) = 1. 04 ± 0. 06, the spectral index of the primordial density fluctuations n_s = 1. 01 ^(+ 0. 08) _(- 0. 06), and the physical baryon density Ω_bh^ 2 = 0. 022 ^(+ 0. 004) _(- 0. 003) among others (all 68...|$|R
