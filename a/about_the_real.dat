5|$|During {{the later}} 19th century, the major {{shipping}} lines financed Swedish emigrant agents {{and paid for}} the production of large quantities of emigration propaganda. Much of this promotional material, such as leaflets, was produced by immigration promoters in the U.S. Propaganda and advertising by shipping line agents was often blamed for emigration by the conservative Swedish ruling class, which grew increasingly alarmed at seeing the agricultural labor force leave the country. It was a Swedish 19th-century cliché to blame the falling ticket prices and the pro-emigration propaganda of the transport system for the craze of emigration, but modern historians have varying views <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> importance of such factors. Brattne and Åkerman have examined the advertising campaigns and the ticket prices as a possible third force between push and pull. They conclude that neither advertisements nor pricing had any decisive influence on Swedish emigration. While the companies remain unwilling, , to open their archives to researchers, the limited sources available suggest that ticket prices did drop in the 1880s, but remained on average artificially high because of cartels and price-fixing. On the other hand, H. A. Barton states that the cost of crossing the Atlantic dropped drastically between 1865 and 1890, encouraging poorer Swedes to emigrate. The research of Brattne and Åkerman has shown that the leaflets sent out by the shipping line agents to prospective emigrants would not so much celebrate conditions in the New World, as simply emphasize the comforts and advantages of the particular company. Descriptions of life in America were unvarnished, and the general advice to emigrants brief and factual. Newspaper advertising, while very common, tended to be repetitive and stereotyped in content.|$|E

40|$|Abstract There are two {{incompatible}} Coq libraries {{that have}} a theory of <b>the</b> <b>real</b> numbers; <b>the</b> Coq standard library gives an axiomatic treatment of classical <b>real</b> numbers, while <b>the</b> CoRN library from Nijmegen defines constructively valid real numbers. Unfortunately, this means results about one structure cannot easily {{be used in the}} other structure. We present a way interfacing these two libraries by showing that their real number structures are isomorphic assuming the classical axioms already present in <b>the</b> standard library <b>reals.</b> This allows us to use O’Connor’s decision procedure for solving ground inequalities present in CoRN to solve inequalities <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>reals</b> from <b>the</b> Coq standard library, and it allows theorems from the Coq standard library to apply to problem <b>about</b> <b>the</b> CoRN <b>reals...</b>|$|R

Gryce revealed very little about his business hardships, but what is known is that his publishing business encountered financial troubles in the early 1960s, with many musicians withdrawing from Melotone and Totem. Many of his colleagues believe that powerful interests considered Gryce's publishing activities a threat, and were forcing him out of business. Rumors circulated about intimidation and threats to his family. While these rumors have not been confirmed, Gryce's behavior became extremely introverted and erratic during this time. He dissolved his publishing companies in 1963 and gave up his music career, thereafter adopting his Islamic name entirely, Basheer Quisim.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> {{identity of the}} architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano, a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, famous for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered {{at the foot of the}} tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.|$|E

25|$|The stately {{foundation}} of Moldavia and of Wallachia, Iorga thought, {{were linked to}} the emergence of major trade routes in the 14th century, and not to the political initiative of military elites. Likewise, Iorga looked into the genesis of boyardom, describing the selective progression of free peasants into a local aristocracy. He described the later violent clash between hospodars and boyars as one between national interest and disruptive centrifugal tendencies, suggesting that prosperous boyardom had undermined the balance of the peasant state. His theory about the peasant nature of Romanian statehood was hotly debated in his lifetime, particularly after a 1920 discovery showed that Radu I of Wallachia had been buried in the full regalia of medieval lords. Another one of his influential (but disputed) claims attributed the appearance of pre-modern slavery, mainly affecting the Romani (Gypsy) minority, exclusively on alien customs borrowed from the Mongol Empire. Iorga's verdicts as a medievalist also produced a long-standing controversy <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> location of the 1330 Battle of Posada—so-named by him after an obscure reference in the Chronicon Pictum—whereby the Wallachian Princes secured their throne.|$|E
25|$|The latest {{approach}} {{discussed here}} is the so-called grating-based imaging, which makes use of the Talbot effect, discovered by Henry Fox Talbot in 1836. This self-imaging effect creates an interference pattern downstream of a diffraction grating. At a particular distance this pattern resembles exactly {{the structure of the}} grating and is recorded by a detector. The position of the interference pattern can be altered by bringing an object in the beam, that induces a phase shift. This displacement of the interference pattern is measured {{with the help of a}} second grating, and by certain reconstruction methods, information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> part of the refractive index is gained. The so-called Talbot–Lau interferometer was initially used in atom interferometry, for instance by John F. Clauser and Shifang Li in 1994. The first X-ray grating interferometers using synchrotron sources were developed by Christian David and colleagues from the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Villingen, Switzerland and the group of Atsushi Momose from the University of Tokyo. In 2005, independently from each other, both David's and Momose's group incorporated computed tomography into grating interferometry, which can be seen as the next milestone in the development of grating-based imaging.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} days of the {{epidemic}} Haseltine recognized a two-fold problem in public perception. Many, both within and outside of the scientific/medical community, did not believe the epidemic would ever pose a serious threat to populations. Others believed that AIDS patients posed an immediate threat of infection and must avoided. To address this issue Haseltine help to create and guide several different groups. One of the most successful groups was the American Foundation of AIDS Research. Haseltine became the first chairman of the scientific advisory board of AMFAR. The mission was twofold, to make start up grants available for those wishing to begin work on HIV/AIDS and to de-stigmatize HIV/AIDS. Many of today's leaders of HIV/AIDS received their first support from AMFAR. The second goal was to provide a body of scientific and medical experts willing to speak out about the danger and magnitude of the epidemic and to provide a credible reference for those worried about causal transmission- in others words a group a qualified experts to speak <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> dangers of the disease and to counter unjustified fears. AmFAR continues in this role today.|$|E
25|$|A modern {{viewpoint}} is {{that the}} Chancellor morphs into a tiger (Thái sư hóa hổ) story in Ngô Sĩ Liên's work might be derived from the book Việt điện u linh (Compilation of the potent spirits in the Realm of Việt) of Lý Tế Xuyên; this hypothesis can explain {{the existence of such}} mythic elements in an official historical record for a dynasty like Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư. Moreover, the story in Việt điện u linh was gathered from the folk story with the main purpose of praising Mục Thận, who was the tutelary deity of Trích Sài village; therefore its accuracy needs to be placed in doubt. During the dynastic time in Vietnam, normally anyone who was tried for treason was killed or forced to commit suicide; therefore the light verdict of Lý Nhân Tông in the case of Lê Văn Thịnh rose a current of beliefs that the chancellor was unjustly judged or wrongly blamed with the crime of treason. The historian Phan Huy Lê, a renowned researcher of History of Vietnam also expressed his doubt <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> motive of the Lê Văn Thịnh's trial, reckoning that the traditional idea of accusing Lê Văn Thịnh was not really appropriate since the story that Lê Văn Thịnh changed into a tiger to kill the emperor could not happen. A more striking hypothesis proposed that the case of Lê Văn Thịnh {{was the result of the}} struggle between supporters of Buddhism led by the Imperial Consort Ỷ Lan and supporters of Confucianism represented by Lê Văn Thịnh. To repress the influence of Confucianism in the royal court, Ỷ Lan made a plot of slandering the chancellor with the crime of treason. This hypothesis was based on the fact that the Imperial Consort Ỷ Lan was a devotee of Buddhism and had used ruthless methods to eliminate her rival in the royal family, the Empress Consort Thượng Dương. On the other hand, Lê Văn Thịnh was proved to be a loyal official with many achievements and did not have any sign of forming party or hatred towards the emperor before the 1096 event. Also asserting that Lê Văn Thịnh was the victim of a struggle in the royal court, another hypothesis speculated that he was harmed because of his ideas about reforming the royal court and the country. According to this hypothesis, Lê Văn Thịnh's innovative thought made him an obstacle for the conservative side in the royal court and thus he was unjustly treated like the chancellor Wang Anshi of the Song Dynasty who lived at the same time as Lê Văn Thịnh and also wanted to reform his country.|$|E
