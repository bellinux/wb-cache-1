40|$|A cascade {{particulate}} analyzer {{was developed}} for nearly real time measurement of the contaminating particulate size distribution in the spacecraft interior ambient environment and as a real time total impacting particulate mass monitor under vacuum conditions. The analyzer has four stages, the first stage is a basic 10 MHz quartz crystal microbalance used widely on spacecraft (such as Skylab) for contamination monitoring purposes. In this application the front sensing crystal is coated with a low vapor pressure <b>adhesive</b> <b>grease</b> which captures impacting particles. This first stage has a wide viewing angle and measures total particulate mass impacting the crystal while the unit is exposed to the vacuum environment. The remaining three states form an aerodynamic impaction cascade with individual quartz crystal microbalances at each stage acting as accumulated mass sensing elements. These three stages thus give relative mass distribution of particulates in three ranges, particles having effective diameter greater than 5 micron, particles between 1 and 5 micron diameter and particles 0. 3 to 1 micron diameter...|$|E

The {{data were obtained}} at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), utilizing equipment developed at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) under contract to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). SRI personnel developed an apparatus for determining the mass loss in vacuum and for collecting the outgassed products. The outgassing data have been presented in three different ways {{in order to facilitate}} material selection. In Section A, the materials are divided by category into the 18 probable uses, such as <b>adhesives,</b> <b>greases,</b> paints, potting compounds, and so forth. In Section B, all the materials contained in Section A are listed in alphabetical order by the manufacturer's identification.

40|$|Thermal {{characterisation}} {{of thermal}} interfaces becomes even tougher a challenge at low bond line thicknesses and higher thermal conductivities of the interface materials as more accurate measurement techniques are required. As in parallel {{the quest for}} high conductivity <b>adhesives</b> and <b>greases</b> is ongoing, a correlation between thermal bulk or interface properties and structure is in high demand. We have developed test-stands for various classes of thermal interface materials. These permit characterisation for materials with thin bond line thickness and high thermal conductivity still using steady state techniques. The methods are benchmarked for <b>greases,</b> <b>adhesives</b> and sintered silver. For the latter, the technology development is described. Then, structural features such as particle density and porosity are examined. It will be the aim to compare and correlate them to thermal resistance.

40|$|Thermal {{interface}} materials (TIMs), including {{thermal conductive}} <b>adhesives</b> (TCAs), <b>grease,</b> phase change materials (PCMs) and thermal pads, {{are widely used}} in thermal management for electronics system. In this work, a bimodal thermal conductive adhesive (b-TCA) composed of epoxy matrix and silver fillers were developed. The silver fillers consist of silver flakes and silver particles. The specimens have been made with the same filler loading fraction, possessing different ratios of silver flake portion to silver particle one to study the filler geometry effects. The thermal conductivity in vertical and in-plane direction were tested, also the electrical resistance in in-plane direction has been measured. Meanwhile, the numerical simulation {{was carried out in}} addition to the experiment. An improved cubic cell model (CCM) was developed to calculate the effective thermal conductivity of the considered b-TCA. Both the experiment and the simulation show the anisotropic thermal conductive property in the b-TCA, but this anisotropy decreased with the increase of silver particle portion in the total filler. And the electrical conductivity also decreased withthe increase of silver particles...|$|R

25|$|A {{heat sink}} is {{designed}} to maximize its surface area {{in contact with the}} cooling medium surrounding it, such as the air. Air velocity, choice of material, protrusion design and surface treatment are factors that affect the performance of a heat sink. Heat sink attachment methods and thermal interface materials also affect the die temperature of the integrated circuit. Thermal <b>adhesive</b> or thermal <b>grease</b> improve the heat sink's performance by filling air gaps between the heat sink and the heat spreader on the device. A heat sink is usually made out of copper and/or aluminium. Copper is used because it has many desirable properties for thermally efficient and durable heat exchangers. First and foremost, copper is an excellent conductor of heat. This means that copper's high thermal conductivity allows heat to pass through it quickly. Aluminium is used in applications where weight is a big concern.|$|R
40|$|The Hydroblast Research Cell at Marshall Space Flight Center {{is used to}} {{investigate}} the use of high pressure waterjets to strip paint, <b>grease,</b> <b>adhesive</b> and thermal spray coatings from various substrates. Current methods of cleaning often use ozone depleting chemicals (ODC) such as chlorinated solvents. High pressure waterjet cleaning {{has proven to be}} a viable alternative to the use of solvents. A popular method of waterjet cleaning involves the use of a rotating, multijet, high pressure water nozzle which is robotically controlled. This method enables rapid cleaning of a large area, but problems such as incomplete coverage and damage to the substrate from the waterjet have been observed. This report summarizes research consisting of identifying and investigating the basic properties of rotating, multijet, high pressure water nozzles, and how particular designs and modes of operation affect such things as stripping rate, standoff distance and completeness of coverage. The study involved computer simulations, an extensive literature review, and experimental studies of different nozzle designs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} development of a compact high volume cascade impactor (HVCI). The HVCI operates at a ow rate of 900 l/min and consists of 4 impaction stages equipped with circular slit-shaped acceleration nozzles and a backup l-ter. The backup lter is placed downstream of the fourth stage and is used to collect the ultra ne particles (dp < 0. 1 m). The major feature of this novel sampler {{is its ability to}} collect relatively large amounts of particles (mg–g levels) onto relatively small polyurethane foam substrates without using adhesives. As previously reported, the capacity of the impaction substrate is 2. 15 g of collected particles per cm 2 of foam. Although the im-paction substrates are not coated with <b>adhesives</b> such as <b>grease</b> or mineral oil, particle bounce and re-entrainment losses were found not to be signi cant. Particles can be easily recovered from the foam substrates using aqueous extraction. The impactor was calibrated using polydisperse particles. The 50 % cutpoints of the 4 stages were 9. 90, 2. 46, 1. 0, and 0. 1 m, respectively. In-terstage losses of ultra ne and ne particles were < 10 % and for coarse particleswere< 20 %.

40|$|The Hydroblast Research Cell at MSFC {{is both a}} {{research}} and a processing facility. The cell is used to investigate fundamental phenomena associated with waterjets {{as well as to}} clean hardware for various NASA and contractor projects. In the area of research, investigations are made regarding the use of high pressure waterjets to strip paint, <b>grease,</b> <b>adhesive</b> and thermal spray coatings from various substrates. Current industrial methods of cleaning often use ozone depleting chemicals (ODC) such as chlorinated solvents, and high pressure waterjet cleaning {{has proven to be a}} viable alternative. Standard methods of waterjet cleaning use hand held or robotically controlled nozzles. The nozzles used can be single-stream or multijet nozzles, and the multijet nozzles may be mounted in a rotating head or arranged in a fan-type shape. We consider in this paper the use of a rotating, multijet, high pressure water nozzle which is robotically controlled. This method enables rapid cleaning of a large area, but problems such as incomplete coverage (e. g. the formation of 'islands' of material not cleaned) and damage to the substrate from the waterjet have been observed. In addition, current stripping operations require the nozzle to be placed at a standoff distance of approximately 2 inches in order to achieve adequate performance. This close proximity of the nozzle to the target to be cleaned poses risks to the nozzle and the target in the event of robot error or the striking of unanticipated extrusions on the target surface as the nozzle sweeps past. Two key motivations of this research are to eliminate the formation of 'coating islands' and to increase the allowable standoff distance of the nozzle...|$|R
40|$|Dicarboxylic acids (DCAs) are {{derivatives}} of {{fatty acids}} {{and can be}} used as precursors for non-petrol-based polyesters and coatings, <b>greases,</b> <b>adhesives,</b> pharmaceuticals etc. Short chain diacids can besynthesized in high yields whereas long chain diacids production is tough and expensive because of its purification from their byproducts are in high demand. To obtain sustainable industry yeasts are considered as best example for producing diacids as they naturally produce small amount of diacids. Alkane assimilating pathway in yeast can produce DCA by using ω-oxidation pathway {{but the problem is that}} the produced diacids can be catabolized in ß oxidation pathway. In the previous studies carried out at VTT the yeasts Yarrowia lipolytica and Pichia guilliermondii which were identified as promising hosts for long chain dicarboxylic acid production were modified by deleting MFE 2 gene of β-oxidation pathway. Prior these strains can be modified further for example by expressing the omega-oxidation cytochrome P 450 hydroxylase complex the marker cassettes have to be removed. To this purposes Cre-recombinase/loxP recombination system was generated in this thesis. A Cre-recombinase plasmid having Cre recombinase, Hph marker gene and autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) was constructed for Yarrowia lipolytica. ARS sequence cloned in this thesis work was compared with published sequences and it was similar toYarrowia lipolytica ARS 18 with 99. 69 % similarity. This shows the ARS sequence obtained in this work is equal to ARS 18. Cre-recombinase plasmid was tested in MFE 2 deleted Yarrowia lipolytica strain and it was able to loop out nourseothricin marker from genomic DNA. Additionally, Cre-recombinase plasmid could be looped out fromYarrowia lipolytica strain. Overexpression of the first enzymes of ω-oxidation-(Nicotiana Tabacum P 450 hydrolase and Arabidopsis thaliana P 450 reductase) in the Yarrowia lipolytica MFE 2 deleted strain was successful. Cultivations with 0. 3 % pelagronic acid (C 9 fatty acid) resulted in 78, 29 mg/l of C 9 diacid production. Whereas with 1 % oleic acid (C 18 : 1 fatty acid) only substrate consumption was observed without diacid production. With Pichia guilliermondiia new method called Gibson assembly was used to construct the cre-recombinase plasmid. Unfortunately, only Hph marker and ARS sequence was cloned into plasmid. ARS sequence cloned in this work was compared to published sequence by using Clustal-w tool: 99. 76 % similarity to the existing P. guilliermondii ARS sequence could be detected. Work can continue further by cloning cre-recombinase into existing plasmid and testing the plasmid in P. guilliermondii MFE 2 deletion strains...|$|R
