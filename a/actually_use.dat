5|$|When the lex Hortensia {{was enacted}} into law, Rome {{theoretically}} became a democracy (insofar as the landowners were concerned, anyway). In reality, however, Rome remained an oligarchy, since the critical laws were still {{enacted by the}} Roman Senate. In effect, democracy was satisfied with the possession of power, but did not care to <b>actually</b> <b>use</b> it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by foreign policy. While upwards of 300,000 citizens were eligible to vote, many of these individuals lived a great distance from Rome, and so calling them all together {{in a short period}} of time was impossible. The foreign affairs questions often required quick answers, and three-hundred senators were more capable of quick action than were thousands of electors. The questions were also more complex than were the questions of the earlier era, and the average citizen was not adequately informed as to these issues. The senators, in contrast, were usually quite experienced, and the fact that they had income sources that were independent of their political roles made it easier for them to involve themselves in policy questions over extended periods of time.|$|E

However, over 96% of the nation has health insurance with varying degrees of care available.|$|E
25|$|The {{fighting}} styles were Powerhouse, Showman, Hardcore, Dirty, Brawler, High-Flyer, Submission and Technical. This {{system was}} highly criticised as these pre-setting gave some wrestlers abilities which they cannot <b>actually</b> <b>use,</b> or stopped them from using common moves. For example, Carlito and Chavo Guerrero {{did not have}} the ability to perform any of their springboard attacks, and Mr. McMahon was as strong as some of the larger characters in the game. Also, the choice of fighting styles limited the variety of moves available in create-a-moveset.|$|E

A special case is systems operating at 670–1000nbsp&nm, where the beam {{may appear to be}} a dull red, even if the light beam is actually very intense. Technicians may also use red lasers for fault finding at around 628–670nbsp&nm. These can create a significant hazard if viewed incorrectly, particularly if they are abnormally high power. Such visible fault finders are usually classified as Classnbsp&2 up to 1nbsp&mW, and Classnbsp&2M up to 10nbsp&mW.|$|E
25|$|However, in some tournaments, the {{organizers}} do not <b>actually</b> <b>use</b> a hat, but form teams while {{taking into account}} skill, experience, sex, age, height, and fitness level of {{the players in the}} attempt to form teams of even strength. Many times the random element remains, so that organizers randomly pick players from each level for each team, combining a lottery with skill matching. Usually, the player provides this information when he or she signs up to enter the tournament. There are also many cities that run hat leagues, structured like a hat tournament, but where the group of players stay together {{over the course of a}} season.|$|E
25|$|A {{postage stamp}} {{is a small}} piece of paper that is {{purchased}} and displayed on an item of mail as evidence of payment of postage. Typically, stamps are printed on special custom-made paper, show a national designation and a denomination (value) on the front, and have an adhesive gum on the back or are self-adhesive. Postage stamps are purchased from a postal administration (post office) or other authorized vendor, and are used to pay for the costs involved in moving mail, as well as other business necessities such as insurance and registration. They are sometimes a source of net profit to the issuing agency, especially when sold to collectors who will not <b>actually</b> <b>use</b> them for postage.|$|E

25|$|Moritz and Cicero (2004) have {{questioned}} the efficacy of DNA barcoding by suggesting that other avian data is inconsistent with Hebert et al.s interpretation, namely, Johnson and Cicero's (2004) finding that 74% of sister species comparisons fall below the 2.7% threshold suggested by Hebert et al. These criticisms are somewhat misleading considering that, of the 39 species comparisons reported by Johnson and Cicero, only 8 <b>actually</b> <b>use</b> COI data to arrive at their conclusions. Johnson and Cicero (2004) have also claimed to have detected bird species with identical DNA barcodes, however, these 'barcodes' refer to an unpublished 723-bp sequence of ND6 which has never been suggested as a likely candidate for DNA barcoding.|$|E
25|$|The look itself {{featured}} a predominantly red balloon, with {{the map of}} the world picked out in orange with white clouds on top, floating over various scenes of the British landscape. The colours were chosen because a blue balloon with a green map would have been more difficult to see against the land and sea. The size of the balloon was originally proposed to be 100ft, but was reduced to 60ft when it was made. The idents {{featured a}} soundtrack of ambient music, with more lively versions being used for more industrial or recreational settings. This made them the first regular BBC One idents to <b>actually</b> <b>use</b> music. The new BBC logo, along with the channel name 'ONE' immediately to the right of it, was overlaid {{at the bottom of the}} screen. The new logo design was an attempt to unify all of the BBC's services and brands under a single logo design, with personality expressed through the idents themselves. The idents were, from October 1998, shown in Widescreen, and the bbc.co.uk URL was added above the logo soon after.|$|E
25|$|Experts have {{tremendous}} experience through practice and {{education in a}} particular field. Musical experts {{use some of the}} same strategies as do many experts in fields that require large amounts of memorization: chunking, organization and practice. For example, musical experts may organize notes into scales or create a hierarchical retrieval scheme to facilitate retrieval from long term memory. In a case study on an expert pianist, researchers Chaffin & Imreh (2002) found that a retrieval scheme was developed to guarantee that the music was recalled with ease. This expert used auditory and motor memory along with conceptual memory. Together the auditory and motor representations allow for automaticity during performance, whereas the conceptual memory is mainly used to mediate when the piece is getting off track. When studying concert soloists, Chaffin and Logan (2006) reiterate that a hierarchical organization exists in memory, but also take this a step further suggesting that they <b>actually</b> <b>use</b> a mental map of the piece allowing them {{to keep track of the}} progression of the piece. Chaffin and Logan (2006) also demonstrate that there are performance cues that monitor the automatic aspects of performance and adjust them accordingly. They distinguish between basic performance cues, interpretive performance cues, and expressive performance cues. Basic cues monitor technical features, interpretive cues monitor changes made in different aspects of the piece, and expressive cues monitor the feelings of the music. These cues are developed when experts pay attention to a particular aspect during practice.|$|E

500|$|Nixon was {{far more}} {{interested}} in foreign affairs than domestic policies, but believed that voters {{tend to focus on}} their own financial condition, and that economic conditions were a threat to his reelection. As part of his [...] "New Federalism" [...] views, he proposed grants to the states, but these proposals were for the most part lost in the congressional budget process. However, Nixon gained political credit for advocating them. In 1970, Congress had granted the President the power to impose wage and price freezes, though the Democratic majorities, knowing Nixon had opposed such controls through his career, did not expect Nixon to <b>actually</b> <b>use</b> the authority. With inflation unresolved by August 1971, and an election year looming, Nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at Camp David.

500|$|Yelp {{receives}} {{about six}} subpoenas a month {{asking for the}} names of anonymous reviewers, mostly from business owners seeking litigation against those writing negative reviews. In 2012 the Alexandria Circuit Court and the Virginia Court of Appeals held Yelp in contempt for refusing to disclose the identities of seven reviewers that anonymously criticized a carpet-cleaning business; in 2014 Yelp appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court. Six internet companies and the Electronic Frontier Foundation said a ruling against Yelp would negatively affect free speech online. The judge from an early ruling {{said that if the}} reviewers did not <b>actually</b> <b>use</b> the businesses' services, their communications would be false claims not protected by free speech laws.

500|$|Several small {{passerine}} species survive freezing winter nights by inducing a lower {{metabolic rate}} and hypothermia, of {{a maximum of}} [...] below normal body temperature, {{in order to reduce}} energy consumption overnight. However, in freezing conditions, it may be that for very small birds, including the tiny goldcrest, the energy economies of induced hypothermia may be insufficient to counterbalance the negative effects of hypothermia including the energy required to raise body temperature back to normal at dawn. Observations of five well-fed birds suggest that they maintain normal body temperatures during cold nights by metabolising fat laid down during the day, and that they <b>actually</b> <b>use</b> behavioural thermoregulation strategies, such as collective roosting in dense foliage or snow holes to survive winter nights. Two birds roosting together reduce their heat loss by a quarter, and three birds by a third. During an 18‑hour winter night, with temperatures as low as [...] in the north of its range, goldcrests huddled together can each burn off fat equivalent to 20% of body weight to keep warm.|$|E
500|$|When the Persians saw the Allied fleet rowing towards them, {{they decided}} to seize the {{opportunity}} to attack, {{even though it was}} late in the day, as they thought they would win an easy victory. They quickly advanced on the much smaller Allied fleet. However, the Allies had come up with a tactic for this situation, where they turned their [...] "bows on to the barbarians, [...] they drew their sterns together in the middle". This is usually taken to mean that they formed into a circle, with their rams pointing outwards; Thucydides reports that in the Peloponnesian War, Peloponnesian fleets twice adopted a circular formation, with their sterns together. However, Herodotus does not <b>actually</b> <b>use</b> the word circle, and Lazenby points out the difficulty of forming a circle of 250 ships (the Peloponnesian fleets had 30–40 ships). It is thus possible the Allies formed into more of a crescent formation, with the wings drawn back to prevent the Persian ships sailing around the Allied line. Whatever the case, it seems likely that this maneuver was intended to negate the superior Persian seamanship, and perhaps specifically the use of diekplous.|$|E
