5000|$|Matsuki {{describes}} the purposes and techniques {{involved in the}} painting of Triumphal Return:The painting “Triumphal Return” {{was done in the}} epoch where the Vietnam War was nearing its zenith. The most vocal of all sentiments was that of 'anti-war'. The most immediate experience which inspired my theme was the one where I, by chance, attended the yearly ceremony of the local American Legion, Long Island New York, in which the entire procession was conducted seemingly most diffident and eventlessly hastened up way. The National Anthem was sung in hushed voices in disarray. The white rectangular military caps looked as forlorn as the brown of deserted piers.There was something moved me deep enough to plunge into my first major work, which the production of demanded total concentration for four months working every night (I painted during night.) Except for Saturday. I went to the movies during the day, to the bar at night for distraction.Preparation of painting surface was done by mixture of opaque and transparent regular oil color pigments produced by Windsor and Newton and Grumbacher which eventually took the hue of reddish dark brown. I used a commercially prepared cotton small grain canvas. So far acceptable for my rendition of details. On this prepared surface, of approximately 1~2 mm thickness of the pigment after sufficient dryness was achieved, I first transferred the final sketch of the theme using medium strength charcoal of commercial origin.Approximately 3 or 4 coats of a commercial brand fixative were applied before the execution of final underdrawing (cartoon) by oil colour, mixture of burnt umber and Prussian blue in various composition ratio for the purpose of shortening drying period, with pure turpentine, as medium.When the under-drawing was sufficiently dry, therefore accepting overlapping pigment application without causing surface damage, I began first application of painting, molding. Medium: pure turpentine plus linseed oil. Ratio, approximately 2 turp/1 linseed. Pigments used were burnt umber, optional Prussian blue and yellow ochre (in later paintings I changed this colour to Naples yellow, because of its larger covering strength and fast drying speed.)After adequate surface dryness of the so far monochromatic sketched first coat (at this level the entire pictorial plane was equally developed), the second coat was applied to achieve chromatic “mapping” according to the psychological connotation and aesthetic atmosphere desired by the theme.In this case, I began by using opaque-est possible pigments for the purpose of similar strength such as yellow ochre, cobalt blue, burnt sienna etc, and quick drying properties like umbers, prussian blue, naples yellow mixed by turp and linseed with aforementioned concoction ratio. At this stage the entire effect of the painting still presents monochromatic, relief-like quality, although proper hues were ascribed to the major areas of the composition. I call it “the view at dusk” for its similarity in chromatic effects.At this stage the painting surface began to appear “realistic” Since the canvas dimensions of “Triumphal Return” is rather large, 50" [...] by 60", the earlier applications became dry enough to accept further application by the time this coast was finished.Once this stage is achieved, real part of “painting” begins: rendering of the objects with utmost objective fidelity. The method I used for this purpose was glazing (thin application of transparent pigment) techniques employing pigments of high transparency such as <b>alizarin</b> <b>crimson,</b> ultramarine, prussian blue, verdian green, chrome yellow, aureolin, zinc white, ivory black, etc.I found later on that the family of “Thalo” had good property for glazing. Especially thalo violet was intriguing in its chameleon-like adaptation to the underlying hues. With same pigment, thalo violet, one can develop several nuances upon surfaces depending on the hues of previous application(s). Thalo family was considered by authority such as Ralph Meyer as comparatively safe but not time tested to the perfect desirability, which might take 500 years to complete. If the surface of “Triumphal Return” crumbles, then the Thalo family of pigments should be buried with it.When the entire pictorial surface was covered and safely dried, I used larger brushes such as 1inch or 1 inch flat, sable and fanshaped and or pig hair brushes, employing “wash” technique which is similar to second coating, to go over the entire canvas in order to achieve thematic and pictorial unity*. This is the final stage of the painting. When the surface becomes adequately dry, regular application of 3~4 coat of “retouch” varnish (I use this frequently to bring out sunk-in colors) was given to the entire pictorial surface. The final varnish by finish varnish was applied much later. In fact, after the exhibitory entry to the 1st NY International Art Show had been over. Pictorial unity: In this case the term is used to connote all the executional aspects utilized for the purpose of constructing pictorial surface."End of Matsuki's description of the painting of Triumphal Return.

40|$|The {{colorants}} alizarin and <b>Alizarin</b> <b>Crimson</b> (a calcium- aluminum lake pigment) {{and their}} simple structural homologue anthraquinone were deposited on silica gel, cellulose, and Teflon substrates and exposed {{in the dark}} to ozone in purified air (0. 4 ppm O_ 3 for 95 days and 10 ppm O_ 3 for 18 - 80 h). Exposed and control samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry. <b>Alizarin</b> <b>Crimson</b> reacted with ozone on all substrates, yielding phthalic acid major), benzoic acid (minor), and other minor and unidentified products. Anthraquinone did not react with ozone irrespective of conditions. Alizarin did not react on Teflon or cellulose but reacted on silica gel to yield phthalic acid (major) and other products. A chemical mechanism responsible for the fading of these alizarin-related colorants by ozone is suggested {{that is consistent with}} the products distribution, the observed reactivity sequence, and the observed substrate-specific effects. The possible application of this work to predicting the ozone fastness of other alizarin-related pigments is discussed briefly...|$|E

40|$|The {{reaction}} products formed upon exposure of selected artists' colorants to gas-phase nitric acid {{have been identified}} using chemical ionization mass spectrometry. The two organic colorants that were most nitric acid-fugitive were triphenylmethane derivatives: the chloride cationic dye basic fuchsin yielded the corresponding nitrate salt, and the carbinol pararosaniline yielded the corresponding organic nitrate ester. Both also yielded small amounts of benzophenones. Other colorants studied yielded only small amounts of oxidation (but not nitration) products, i. e., phenols and/or ring-opening products: benzoic acid and hydroxyquinacridone from acridones, isatin and isatoic anhydride from indigo, trihydroxyanthraquinone from alizarin, and phthalic acid from <b>Alizarin</b> <b>Crimson.</b> The corresponding reaction mechanisms are outlined.

40|$|A noncontact {{technique}} is described that uses atomic oxygen generated under low {{pressure in the}} presence of nitrogen to remove soot from the surface of a test watercolor panel and strips of cotton, wool and silk. The process, which involves surface oxidation, permits control of the amount of surface material removed. The effectiveness of soot removal from test panels of six basic watercolors (<b>alizarin</b> <b>crimson,</b> burnt sienna, lemon yellow, yellow ochre, cerulean blue and ultramarine blue) and strips of colored cotton, wool and silk was measured using reflectance spectroscopy. The atomic oxygen removed soot effectively from the treated areas and enabled partial recovery of charred watercolors. However, overexposure can result in removal of sizing, bleaching, and weakening of the structure. With the proper precautions, atomic oxygen treatment appears to have great potential to salvage heavily smoke damaged artworks which were previously considered unrestorable...|$|E
30|$|Both XRF and UV–Vis-NIR {{reflection}} and emission spectroscopies have inferred that red 2 paint areas contain a CdS 1 −xSex pigment (Fig.  3 a, d and e). Following the method reported in [12], a deeper {{examination of the}} optical band gap has revealed the pigment stoichiometry with a selenium molar fraction of about 0.31. The identification has been supported by the emission profiles in the red-NIR range (Fig.  3 a, black line) showing two DLE bands [12]. From the energy position of the first DLE band, the Se molar fraction has been estimated to be of about 0.33. All the emission spectra recorded on red 2 areas are characterized by an additional band in the visible range (λmax =  605  nm) which has tentatively suggested {{the presence of an}} organic pigment different from PR 3 (Fig.  3 a, blue line), although it could be also due to the emission of the binder partially filtered by the cadmium red [19]. The Raman spectrum recorded on a red 2 paint from the edge reported in Fig.  3 c (black line), shows some weak bands (over a strong fluorescence background) at about 1290, 1327 and 1480  cm− 1 which has allowed to confirm the presence of an organic dye, tentatively identified as anthraquinone-based compound [20]. FTIR spectra recorded on Cd- and Se-rich areas indicated strong signals of BaSO 4 (reststrahlen asym stretching bands at ca. 1070  cm− 1 and derivative bending modes in the range 700 – 600  cm− 1) and very weak and sharp signals that although not assignable {{may be related to the}} organic pigment (Fig.  3 b, black line; region highlighted by the rectangle).
