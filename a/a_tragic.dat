5|$|A {{departure}} from the hip-hop and R sound of her previous studio albums, the track is a country and pop ballad revolving around body image and female empowerment. Media outlets had varying opinions of the song's genre, describing it as having soul, blues, gospel, and show tune influences. In the lyrics, Fantasia narrates <b>a</b> <b>tragic</b> story about a woman, while providing commentary on social class, marriage, and alcoholism. Inspired by her past, she recorded the single {{as a way to}} empower women and reconcile with her childhood insecurities.|$|E
5|$|Adam Evans/Rubber-Band Man (voiced by Kadeem Hardison) – A meta-human {{whose body}} {{structure}} consists of shapeable rubber. He is {{the younger brother}} of Static's archenemy, Ebon. Rubber-Band Man first appears as <b>a</b> <b>tragic</b> villain when he goes after an opportunistic record producer who stole one of his songs. He subsequently breaks out of prison but decides not to pursue a criminal career, however. He and Sharon eventually start dating, with Sharon helping Adam turn over a new leaf. He and Virgil initially clash, but Virgil comes to accept Adam's relationship with his sister and they become allies in crime-fighting, with Adam even becoming like an older-brother figure to Virgil.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, most war {{memorials}} {{were relatively}} conservative in design, aiming to use established styles to produce <b>a</b> <b>tragic</b> but comforting, noble and enduring {{commemoration of the}} war dead. Classical themes were particularly common, taking the prevailing styles of the late 19th century and typically simplifying them to produce cleaner, more abstract memorials. Allegorical and symbolic features, frequently drawing on Christian imagery, were used to communicate themes of self-sacrifice, victory and death. Some memorials adopted a medievalist theme instead, looking backwards to a more secure past, while others used emerging realist and Art Deco architectural styles to communicate the themes of the war.|$|E

5|$|In all {{games from}} the second onwards, the player will gain access {{to a series of}} (predominantly 8-bit) minigames, {{sometimes}} randomly after death, as in the second game, and sometimes once the player has completed a specific task. These minigames usually tell a story or event relevant to the game's lore, although mostly presented in a cryptic way. For example, minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 2 are speculated to portray the homicidal incidents previously mentioned in the games. Minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 4 tell the story of a character, possibly the player character, who dies in <b>a</b> <b>tragic</b> accident.|$|E

The program was canceled after a series of unsatisfactory results and <b>a</b> <b>tragic</b> accident on 4 November 1954, when test pilot Charles E. Richbourg was killed when the Sea Dart he was piloting disintegrated in midair. The four surviving planes were retired in 1957, but some were kept in reserve until 1962.|$|E
5|$|The final scene, {{in which}} Radar informs {{everyone}} {{of the death}} of Henry Blake was unprecedented: {{it was the first time}} in American television history that a main character departing a comedy series was killed off in <b>a</b> <b>tragic</b> way. When Stevenson decided to leave the series part way through the third season, Gene Reynolds and Larry Gelbart, the show's producers, decided to make a statement regarding the unexpectedness and horror of war, especially with the Vietnam War fresh in people's minds.|$|E

5|$|The loss of Scott and {{his party}} overshadowed all else in the British public's mind, {{including}} Amundsen's feat in being first at the Pole. For many years the image of Scott as <b>a</b> <b>tragic</b> hero, beyond reproach, remained virtually unchallenged, for although there were rifts among some who were close to the expedition, including relatives of those who died, this disharmony was not public. There was no real change in public perceptions until the 1970s, by which time nearly all those directly concerned with the expedition were dead.|$|E
5|$|While The Nemesis' design {{remained}} similar, {{the character}} itself was expanded upon, now portrayed as <b>a</b> <b>tragic</b> villain. Formerly Matt Addison (portrayed by Eric Mabius), {{a survivor of}} the events of the first film, he was infected with the T-virus after being scratched by a Licker and later captured and experimented upon by the Umbrella Corporation. Transformed into the Nemesis, it is sent to kill the surviving members of STARS, but remembers its humanity after fighting Alice, and fights alongside the protagonists towards the film's conclusion. The Nemesis is eventually crushed beneath a crashing helicopter, and is later killed by the nuclear explosion that destroys Raccoon City.|$|E
5|$|Air Mata Iboe {{was written}} and {{directed}} by Njoo Cheong Seng under his penname M. d'Amour; he had previously directed Djantoeng Hati (Heart and Soul; 1941), which also had <b>a</b> <b>tragic</b> ending, for the company. The film was produced by the company's owner, Fred Young. It starred Njoo's wife Fifi Young (no relation to Fred), RdIsmail, Ali Sarosa, and Ali Joego. Other roles were held by established singers of keroncong (traditional music with Portuguese influences), including Soerip, Titing, Soelami, Ning Nong, and Poniman. The film, which used make-up to make Fifi Young age into an old woman over the course of its plot, was the actress' first for Majestic; she had been ill during the production of her husband's debut for the company.|$|E

5|$|Balakirev's despotism {{strained}} {{the relationship}} between him and Tchaikovsky but both men still appreciated each other's abilities. Despite their friction, Balakirev proved the only man to persuade Tchaikovsky to rewrite a work several times, as he would with Romeo and Juliet. At Balakirev's suggestion, Tchaikovsky based the work on Balakirev's King Lear, <b>a</b> <b>tragic</b> overture in sonata form after the example of Beethoven's concert overtures. It was Tchaikovsky's idea to reduce the plot to one central conflict and represent it musically with the binary structure of sonata form. However, the execution of that plot in the music we know today came only after two radical revisions. Balakirev discarded many of the early drafts Tchaikovsky sent him and, with the flurry of suggestions between the two men, the piece was constantly in the mail between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|Biographies {{published}} {{after his}} death were typically heavy on eulogy. Theodore Martin's five-volume magnum opus was authorised and supervised by Queen Victoria, and her influence shows in its pages. Nevertheless, it is an accurate and exhaustive account. Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria (1921) was more critical, but it was discredited in part by mid-twentieth-century biographers such as Hector Bolitho and Roger Fulford, who (unlike Strachey) had access to Victoria's journal and letters. Popular myths about Prince Albert—such as the claim that he introduced Christmas trees to Britain—are dismissed by scholars. Recent biographers, such as Stanley Weintraub, portray Albert as a figure in <b>a</b> <b>tragic</b> romance, who died too soon and was mourned by his lover for a lifetime. In the 2009 movie The Young Victoria, Albert, played by Rupert Friend, is made into a heroic character; in the fictionalised depiction of the 1840 shooting, he is struck by a bullet—something {{that did not happen}} in real life.|$|E
5|$|Flann's {{daughter}} Gormflaith ingen Flann Sinna {{became the}} subject of later literary accounts, accounted which depicted her as <b>a</b> <b>tragic</b> figure. She was married first to Cormac mac Cuilennáin of the Eóganachta, who had taken vows of celibacy as a bishop. On Cormac's death in battle in 908, fighting against her father, she was married to Cerball mac Muirecáin of the Uí Dúnlainge, who supposedly abused her. Cerball was a key ally of Gormlaith's father. After Cerball's death in 909 Gormlaith married her stepbrother Niall Glúndub, who died in 919. The Annals of Clonmacnoise have her wandering Ireland after Niall's death, forsaken by her kin, and reduced to begging from door to door, although this is thought to be later invention rather than a tradition with a basis in fact.|$|E
