5|$|As of 1 June 1989, the International Institute for Strategic Studies {{estimated}} that the Army comprised four corps and 12 division headquarters. At the time, the military had decreased considerably in size. The IISS noted that these formations 'were in name only; below establishment in units, men, and equipment. Brigades were of battalion size.' Units and formations listed in 1990 within six military sectors included the twelve divisions, four tank brigades, 45 mechanized and infantry brigades, 4 commando brigades, 1 surface-to-air missile brigade, 3 field artillery brigades, 30 field battalions, and one <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> <b>artillery</b> battalion.|$|E
5|$|The {{system was}} impractical. The Hamburg air defence {{district}} controlled both air and ground defences, but each was geographically {{in no position}} to help the other. There was no combined arms synthesis, meaning that the FlaK arm did not directly support the German defences thereby forming one mass defence. Instead, fighter units protecting the coast were held there, with Kriegsmarine FlaK units, while the Hamburg <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> <b>artillery</b> was held too far inland. The Luftwaffe fighters and FlaK units were located too far apart to coordinate.|$|E
25|$|By that time, the {{security}} forces on-site {{at the time were}} the Police Mobile Brigade, 9th Cavalry Battalion, 203rd Infantry Battalion, KOSTRAD <b>Air</b> <b>Defence</b> <b>Artillery,</b> 202nd Infantry Battalion, Kodam Jaya riot squad and a motorised brigade. They were equipped with riot shields, tear gas, Steyr AUGs, and Pindad SS-1s.|$|E

25|$|The 250 <b>Air</b> <b>Defence</b> <b>Artillery</b> Group, {{also known}} as the 250 Air Defence Unit (ADU), was a group of air defence squadrons that {{operated}} {{under the control of the}} South African Air Force tasked with airbase defence. The group consisted of 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129 and 130 Squadrons and had its own active Citizen Force component. These squadrons were equipped with the Tigercat mobile surface-to-air missile system, The Cactus surface-to-air missile system, the ZU-23-2 23mm Anti-Aircraft Gun and the Bofors 40 mm gun.|$|E
25|$|Once at the {{military}} command, the group unsuccessfully demanded {{the release of the}} prisoners. At roughly 11 p.m. local time (UTC+7), the protestors surrounded {{the military}} command.

Around midnight, eyewitnesses saw military commander of Jakarta Try Sutrisno and Chief of the Armed Forces Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani supervising the removal of the victims; the corpses were loaded into military trucks and buried in unmarked graves, while the wounded were sent to Gatot Soebroto Military Hospital.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the AAD dates back to 1939 during the times of the British Raj in India. The corps {{actively}} {{took part in the}} Second World War fighting on behalf of the British Empire.

The corps enjoyed autonomous status from 1994, after the bifurcation of the Corps of <b>Air</b> <b>Defence</b> <b>Artillery</b> from the Army's artillery regiment. A separate training school, the Army Air Defence College (AADC), was established to train its personnel.|$|E

The school was later renamed as 'Army Air Defence College (AADC)' in 1998. The academy enjoyed autonomy after the bifucartions of the Corps of Army Air Defence from the Regimenet of Artillery. In 2008, the Army Air Defence Centre was also merged into this academy.|$|E
500|$|A {{key part}} of the {{birthday}} celebrations was the large demonstration of Nazi Germany's military capabilities. The display was intended in part as a warning to the Western powers. The parade, which lasted about five hours, included 12 companies of the Luftwaffe, 12 companies of the army, and 12 companies of the navy, as well as units of the Schutzstaffel (SS). In total, 40,000 to 50,000 German troops took part. 162 warplanes flew over Berlin. The grandstand comprised 20,000 official guests, and the parade was watched by several hundred thousand spectators. Features of the parade were large long range <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> <b>artillery</b> guns, emphasis on motorized artillery and development of air defense units.

500|$|News {{coverage}} of the battle produced television footage of ZNG <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> <b>artillery</b> at Zečevo firing at a Yugoslav Air Force Soko J-21 Jastreb and scoring a hit on another J-21 using a guided missile. The footage, ending in shouts claiming that both of the planes were downed, {{became one of the}} most significant pieces of material in terms of propaganda and morale in Croatia. Nonetheless, the footage proved controversial, since the first plane is not shown falling to the ground or into the sea, but diving towards the horizon after giving away a puff of smoke [...] variously interpreted as smoke caused by the plane's cannon fire or anti-aircraft fire damage. While the first J-21 downing remains unconfirmed, the second J-21, piloted by Croat Valter Juršić of the 240th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron, was shot down by Neven Livajić using a 9K38 Igla and wreckage of the plane was retrieved.|$|E

2500|$|Richthofen's {{experiences}} were {{to serve the}} Luftwaffe well in the long-term and he was leading proponent of army support aviation at this time. His own learning curve in the war highlighted several issues that a modern air force would have to overcome. The most important issues concerned tactical and operational level warfare. Unlike the Italian officers from the Regia Aeronautica operating in Spain, the Germans put {{a great deal of}} effort into developing close air support doctrine in the late 1930s. Tactically, Richthofen found little need to retain anti-aircraft artillery to defend airfields. He pushed Flak units into the frontline to bolster the artillery units. Rapid fire 20mm calibres and 88mm weapons were first used in Spain and their effectiveness was reported to Berlin. Soon this tactic became part of Luftwaffe doctrine. [...] Richthofen was pleased with his idea, and the knowledge the [...] "Flak" [...] theorists in Berlin were not happy about using <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> <b>artillery</b> in the ground battle.|$|E
