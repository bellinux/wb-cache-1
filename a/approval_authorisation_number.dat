50|$|The PAL {{establishes}} {{labelling requirements}} for all items under its purview, {{requiring them to}} display an <b>authorisation</b> <b>number,</b> expiration date, usage instructions, {{and a list of}} side effects. Such items are not limited to ingested medicines, but include other items such as condoms and face masks. The Department of Health is tasked with inspections to ensure compliance with the law; private organisations such as the Consumers' Foundation have also been known to carry out clandestine checks. A February 2007 check of sex shops found that 18 out of 25 condom brands did not label their ingredients clearly or at all, while 22 gave an incorrect <b>authorisation</b> <b>number</b> or none at all. A 2009 survey, also by the Consumers' Foundation, looked at 41 face masks (17 N95 masks and 24 surgical masks), and found that 90% did not meet the labelling and packaging requirements.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn the EU, a {{regulatory}} framework {{has been established}} which defines general conditions for marketing <b>authorisation</b> <b>approval</b> of similar biological medicinal products (SBMPs). In addition, the framework provides product-class specific recommendations for non-clinical evaluation of specific SBMPs containing as active substance recombinant somatropin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), erythropoietin, interferon alpha, insulin or low molecular weight heparins. During the last years, a number of SBMPs have been succesfully licensed in the EU. This article summarizes the non-clinical evaluations performed for these medicinal products and provides a comparison with the current requests for non-clinical evaluation as laid down in the respective EU regulatory guidelines...|$|R
40|$|The inequalities {{presented}} across Europe with {{respects to}} patients’ access to new medicines in part results from differences in processes {{and activities of}} Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and reimbursement processes that follow an <b>approval</b> of marketing <b>authorisation.</b> There is a dilemma between provision of innovative new medicines and ensuring that the pharmaceuticals chosen {{meet the needs of}} their healthcare system, thus providing quality and an affordable price. A greater understanding of the European Economic Area (EEA) healthcare systems and their processes leading to reimbursement decision-making is required in order to help understand why different outcomes occur and to identify where process improvement may influence such outcomes...|$|R
50|$|The noncompetitive AMPA {{receptor}} antagonists talampanel and perampanel {{have been}} demonstrated to have activity {{in the treatment of}} adults with partial seizures, indicating that AMPA receptor antagonists represent a potential target for the treatment of epilepsy. Perampanel (trade name: Fycompa) received Marketing <b>Authorisation</b> <b>Approval</b> by the European Commission for the treatment of partial epilepsy on July 27, 2012. The drug was approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 22, 2012. As has been the case for most recently developed AEDs including pregabalin, lacosamide and ezogabine, the FDA recommended that perampanel be classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as a scheduled drug. It has been designated as a Schedule 3 controlled substance.|$|R
40|$|Gated {{developments}} {{have long been}} a subject of research the world over. Most international and South African {{studies have focused on}} gated developments within the metropolitan sphere, with very few studies done on non-metropolitan gated developments. This research attempts to address this research gap by focusing on the spatio-temporal aspects of non-metropolitan gated residential security estates in the Western Cape Province. It was found that most non-metropolitan gated residential security estates were located in settlements along the coast and/or in close proximity to the metropolitan area of Cape Town. Furthermore, {{the first half of the}} first decade of the twenty first century witnessed the planning <b>authorisation</b> <b>approval</b> of more than two thirds of all non-metropolitan gated residential security estates. While the locational and temporal aspects of non-metropolitan gated residential security estates in the Western Cape Province are discussed in this paper, there remain a number of avenues for further research into the phenomenon of non-metropolitan gated developments. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Cell-based therapies {{have been}} in use in {{veterinary}} medicine for years. However, the legal requirement of manufacturing, {{placing on the market}} and use of cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals are not as well developed as the respective requirements of chemical pharmaceuticals. Cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals are medicinal products {{in the sense of the}} pharmaceutical law of the European Union (EU). For that reason, such medicinal products principally require official approval for their manufacture and an official marketing authorisation for their placement on the market before being used by the veterinarian. The manufacture, placing on the market and use of cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals without manufacturing <b>approval</b> and marketing <b>authorisation</b> is permitted only in certain exceptional cases determined by EU and individual Member State law. Violations of this requirement may have consequences for the respective veterinarian under criminal law and under the code of professional conduct in the respective Member State. The regular use of cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals within the scope of a therapeutic emergency as well as the import of such veterinary pharmaceuticals from non-European countries for use in the EU are currently out of the question in the EU because of a lack of legal bases. Here, we review the general legal requirement of manufacturing, placing on the market and use of cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals within the EU and point out different implementations of EU law within the different Member States...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Fatigue is a {{frequent}} and troublesome manifestation of chronic sarcoidosis. This symptom can be debilitating and difficult to treat, with poor response to the treatment. Symptomatic management with neurostimulants, such as methylphenidate, is a possible treatment option. The use of such treatment strategies is not without precedent and has been trialled in cancer-related fatigue. Their use in sarcoidosis requires further evaluation {{before it can be}} recommended for clinical practice. Methods and analysis: The Fatigue and Sarcoidosis—Treatment with Methylphenidate study is a randomised, controlled, parallel-arm and feasibility trial of methylphenidate for the treatment of sarcoidosis-associated fatigue. Patients are eligible if they have a diagnosis of sarcoidosis, significant fatigue (measured using the Fatigue Assessment Scale) and have stable disease. Up to 30 participants will be randomly assigned to either methylphenidate (20 mg two times per day) or identical placebo in a 3 : 2 ratio for 24 weeks. The primary objective is to collect data determining the feasibility of a future study powered to determine the clinical efficacy of methylphenidate for sarcoidosis-associated fatigue. The trial is presently open and will continue until July 2018. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee on 21 June 2016 (reference 16 /EE/ 0087) and was approved and sponsored by the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (reference 190280). Clinical Trial <b>Authorisation</b> (EudraCT <b>number</b> 2016 - 000342 - 60) from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was granted on 19 April 2016. Results will be presented at relevant conferences and submitted to appropriate journals following trial closure and analysis...|$|R
40|$|For {{over twenty}} years, {{beginning}} in 1949, {{more than a}} score of British Members of Parliament, and an additional handful of Peers, have absented themselves from Westminster {{for up to two}} months of the Parliamentary session with the <b>approval,</b> indeed upon <b>authorisation</b> of party leaders, in order to serve as delegates to one or more international parliamentary assemblies. Two of these assemblies, those of the Council of Europe and of Western European Union, have consistently concerned themselves with projects for bringing about closer British participation in the movement for European integration. Nevertheless, not only has virtually no attempt been made to discern a relationship between British parliamentary activity at these assemblies and the evolution of British attitudes toward European integration, but in fact no study has been expressly devoted to any aspect of British service in, or attitudes to, any of these bodies. The present study seeks to provide a clear picture of the nature of British involvement {{in the work of the}} Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe in particular, and to a lesser extent, that of the WEU Assembly and of the North Atlantic Assembly. It endeavours to determine the functions which British delegates, and the party leaders who directly or indirectly approved their appointment, ascribed to the assemblies, and to outline the way in which their view of the assemblies' functions affected their own activities at those bodies and their work at Westminster and in their constituencies. Clearly, parliamentary views about the functions of these assemblies may have undergone some change over time, and special attention therefore is devoted to the evolution of British governmental, party and delegate attitudes to the work of the assemblies, Particularly that of the Consultative Assembly - the oldest, best known and most active of the three - from 1961 onwards, that is, from teh year of Britain's first overture for EEC membership.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a quantified method for determining the mental workload imposed on train control officers (TCOs) and to express this mental workload by means of an index that is objective and can stand up to the tests of validity and reliability. The method addresses an existing operational shortcoming in Spoornet train control operations and could be used as a tool for predicting the mental workload imposed on operators at particular train control centres. The method could be applied to manage and improve operational safety in the rail transport environment. A participative systems approach was followed in the development of the measuring methodology. A work group comprising expert users of the specific train control system was involved in identifying task factors and assigning weights for task and moderating factors. The newly developed Mental Workload Index (MWLI) consists of three task factors and eleven moderating factors, each with a different weight in terms of its contribution to overall mental workload. The work group performed several iterations to reach final consensus on the following task factors and their respective contributions to the MWLI: the number of data transactions, the <b>number</b> of <b>authorisations,</b> and the <b>number</b> of communications via telephone and radio. The systems approach used in the development process is discussed, and the final index with the task and moderating factors is presented. In conclusion, the value and possible application of the MWLI are discussed. The MWLI is shown to provide an objective method for the assessment and prediction of mental workload in the train control environment. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.
