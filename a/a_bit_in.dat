5|$|The Eighteenth Dynasty tombs {{within the}} valley vary quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> decoration, style, and location. It seems {{that at first}} there was no fixed plan. The tomb of Hatshepsut has a unique shape, {{twisting}} and turning down over 200metres from the entrance, so that the burial chamber is 97metres below the surface. The tombs gradually became more regular and formalised, and those of Thutmose III and Thutmose IV, KV34 and KV43, are good examples of Eighteenth Dynasty tombs, both with their bent axis, and simple decoration.|$|E

25|$|An {{inherent}} advantage yielded by {{quantum cryptography}} {{when compared to}} classical cryptography is the detection of passive eavesdropping. This is a natural result {{of the behavior of}} quantum bits; due to the observer effect, if <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> a superposition state were to be observed, the superposition state would collapse into an eigenstate. Because the intended recipient was expecting to receive the bit in a superposition state, the intended recipient would know there was an attack, because the bit's state would no longer be in a superposition.|$|E

Gregory uses Jacquetta's tenuous ties to Melusine and Joan of Arc to further her potential ties to witchcraft.

25|$|MIPS III {{removed the}} Coprocessor 3 (CP3) support instructions, and reused its opcodes {{for the new}} doubleword instructions. The {{remaining}} coprocessors gained instructions to move doublewords between coprocessor registers and the GPRs. The floating general registers (FGRs) were extended to 64 bits and the requirement for instructions to use even-numbered register only was removed. This is incompatible with earlier versions of the architecture; <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> the floating-point control/status register is used to operate the MIPS III floating-point unit (FPU) in a MIPS I- and II-compatible mode.
