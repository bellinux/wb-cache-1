5|$|Destroying this {{symbol of}} British naval power {{by means of}} a {{submarine}} would at least be a blow to British morale and, perhaps, threaten the British blockade and control of New York Harbor. The plan was to have Lee surface just behind Eagles rudder and use a screw to attach an explosive to the ship’s hull. Once attached, Lee would re-enter the water <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> getaway.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan {{soon became}} a {{favourite}} of the king and was the envy of {{other members of the}} court. A plot was hatched to disgrace him and Dunstan was accused of being involved with witchcraft and black magic. The king ordered him to leave the court and as Dunstan was leaving the palace his enemies physically attacked him, beat him severely, bound him, and threw him into a cesspool. He managed to crawl out <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> way to the house of a friend. From there, he journeyed to Winchester and entered the service of his uncle, Ælfheah, Bishop of Winchester.|$|E
5|$|In July 1914, Cubitt was {{appointed}} Deputy Commissioner and Officer Commanding for the Somaliland Protectorate; after the disastrous Battle of Dul Madoba, the colonial administration {{was seeking to}} restore British control over the inland areas of the Protectorate. Cubitt planned and commanded a series of operations through the winter of 1914-15, destroying several Dervish forts. Shortly after he arrived in Somaliland, the First World War had broken out, and once the winter campaign was over he requested {{to be transferred to}} Europe; the request was granted, but it took until early 1916 for him to be replaced <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> way home. For his services in Africa, he {{was appointed}} a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and a Companion of the Bath, and promoted to brevet Colonel.|$|E

5|$|On June 6, 1944, and afterward, {{most of the}} American {{airborne}} landings in Normandy {{were flown}} into areas that were not studded with Rommelspargel. Some flights, however, came up hard against the defense. Accompanying the 82nd Airborne Division, Tito Moruza landed on D-Day with orders to don civilian clothing <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> way to Paris to seize Gestapo papers. His glider hit a wooden pole defense which tore into the three soldiers sitting next to him, mortally wounding them. More casualties were inflicted during delivery of glider infantry reinforcements when some 16–18 gliders landed {{in a field of}} Rommelspargel and the troops that crawled from the wrecked gliders were immediately targeted by German small arms fire. Of 250 troops landing, some 50–60 survived.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Grace and Annie take Margaret to a {{local bar}} {{as part of her}} bachelorette party to watch a strip dance by a locally famous but over-the-hill exotic dancer, Ramone. Stepping away from the show, Margaret learns from Gertrude that Andrew wanted to become an editor <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> own life and that Andrew had {{proposed}} to Gertrude. However, Gertrude refused because she didn't want to leave Sitka for New York. Returning home, Margaret learns of the conflict between Andrew and Joe. That night, Margaret asks Andrew about his relationship with his father, but Andrew refuses to talk. Instead, Margaret opens up to Andrew.|$|E
5|$|El Greco did {{not plan}} to settle {{permanently}} in Toledo, since his final aim was to win the favor of Philip <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> mark in his court. Indeed, he did manage to secure two important commissions from the monarch: Allegory of the Holy League and Martyrdom of St. Maurice. However, the king {{did not like the}}se works and placed the St Maurice altarpiece in the chapter-house rather than the intended chapel. He gave no further commissions to El Greco. The exact reasons for the king's dissatisfaction remain unclear. Some scholars have suggested that Philip did not like the inclusion of living persons in a religious scene; some others that El Greco's works violated a basic rule of the Counter-Reformation, namely that in the image the content was paramount rather than the style. Philip took a close interest in his artistic commissions, and had very decided tastes; a long sought-after sculpted Crucifixion by Benvenuto Cellini also failed to please when it arrived, and was likewise exiled to a less prominent place. Philip's next experiment, with Federico Zuccari was even less successful. In any case, Philip's dissatisfaction ended any hopes of royal patronage El Greco may have had.|$|E

5|$|The injury forced Carlisle to {{miss the}} first eight months of the 2006–07 Premier League season, and he {{eventually}} returned to full training in February 2007. He played in two reserve team matches for Watford in order to regain some fitness, hoping to break into the first team <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> Premier League debut. On 2 March 2007, Carlisle joined local rivals Luton Town on a one-month emergency loan deal in an attempt to return to full match fitness. He made his debut for Luton the following day in the 3–2 away defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Championship, coming on as a substitute for Matthew Spring, who had himself joined the club from Watford earlier in the season after failing to break into the first team. Carlisle went on to play five matches for Luton. He made his final appearance on 31 March 2007, in a 0–0 draw with Burnley at Turf Moor, before returning to Watford on 2 April 2007. He finally played his first Premier League match on 9 April 2007, starting in the 4–2 victory over Portsmouth. He was selected to play in the team's following match, an FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United, but despite being named man of the match for his performance, Watford were defeated 4–1 at Villa Park. Carlisle went on to play in Watford's following three league matches of the season as their relegation back to the Championship was confirmed after a 1–1 draw with Manchester City at Vicarage Road.|$|E

25|$|Orr {{attempts}} {{to escape the}} war in two main ways. His first {{goal is to get}} a whore to knock him unconscious, so that he can be grounded.

Orr practices this second goal by getting shot down every mission he flies, and so becomes an expert in crash landings, without losing a single crewman.|$|E

25|$|Trying new techniques, Perret {{progressively}} filmed more outdoors and, sometimes, {{outside of}} Paris. He even experimented {{with the police}} genre with the trilogy Main de fer. The same year Léonce directed L'Enfant de Paris, the film that would {{mark the end of}} his financial difficulties <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> {{reputation as one of the}} best French directors of his era. L'Enfant de Paris was subsequently remade several times. Léonce demonstrated with this film that French filmmaking technique rivaled that of the Americans, even the technique of the eminent American director D. W. Griffith.|$|E
25|$|Kierkegaard {{decided to}} step up to the Tree of the {{knowledge}} of good and evil for himself, replacing Adam, <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> choice in the presence of God, where no one was there to accuse or judge him but his Creator. This is what he had Abraham do in Fear and Trembling. This is how Kierkegaard thought learning about oneself takes place. Here is where the single individual learns about guilt and innocence. His book, The Concept of Anxiety, makes clear that Adam did have knowledge when he made his choice and that was the knowledge of freedom. The prohibition was there but so was freedom and Eve and Adam decided to use it.|$|E
25|$|For a batsman the popping crease – {{which can}} be {{referred}} to as the batting crease in the context of batting – determines whether they have been stumped or run out. This is described in Laws 29, 38, and 39 of the laws of cricket. Both involve the wicket being put down before a batsman can touch his body or bat to the ground behind the popping crease <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> ground and return safely from his run. A 2010 amendment to Law 29 clarified the circumstance where the wicket is put down while a batsman has become fully airborne after having first made his ground; the batsman is regarded to not be out of his ground.|$|E

25|$|Nikolai, {{initially}} {{delighted to}} have his son return home, slowly begins to feel uneasy, and a certain awkwardness in his regard, as it emerges that Arkady's views, much influenced by Bazarov, are radical <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> own beliefs feel dated. Nikolai has always tried to stay as current as possible, by doing things such as visiting his son at school so the two can stay as close as they are, but this in Nikolai's eyes has failed. To complicate this, the father has taken a servant, Fenechka, into his house {{to live with him}} and has already had a son by her. Arkady however is not troubled by the relationship: to the contrary, he openly celebrates the addition of a younger brother.|$|E
25|$|Wolfe arrived outside Quebec on 28 June. For much of {{the rest}} of the summer, he probed the defences of the city, trying to find a way through. Montcalm {{constantly}} frustrated him, shifting his own troops about in response. The cat-and-mouse game between the two generals reached a climax towards the end of the summer. If Wolfe could not capture the city he would likely be forced to withdraw in the face of the hostile Canadian winter. An attempt to land on the Montmorency was beaten back at the Battle of Beauport, and almost proved disastrous. Wolfe now searched for another place to land <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> attack. On 12 September the British learned of a convenient landing spot, and Wolfe moved his army there at night. The following day the Battle of the Plains of Abraham took place. It proved to be a decisive British victory, though one in which both Wolfe and Montcalm were killed. The British then took over the city.|$|E
25|$|Coming upon Lee, Fremantle {{found him}} {{rallying}} the defeated troops, reassuring them {{and trying to}} rally them ahead of an anticipated Union counterattack. The Union counterattack did not come, however, and Fremantle retreated {{along with the rest}} of the Confederate Army on the night of 4 July. As the army fell back into Maryland, Fremantle met Jeb Stuart, the cavalry commander whose absence during the preceding battle cost Lee valuable intelligence. On 7 July, Fremantle took his leave of Longstreet and his staff, intending to cross the Union lines <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> way to New York. A parting remark made by Major Latrobe did little to reassure him: 'You may take your oath he'll be caught for a spy'. Longstreet was more confident of Fremantle's abilities, informing his aide that, since Fremantle had managed to travel across lawless areas of Texas, crossing the Union lines would cause him little difficulty.|$|E
