50|$|Soft drinks, candy, cookies, snack crackers, and {{ice cream}} are food items and <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> {{eligible}} items. Seafood, steak, and bakery cakes are also food items and <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> eligible items.|$|R
30|$|The {{prognosis}} {{depends on}} prompt treatment. It <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> important to perform cervicovaginal swabs on women at risk because of IUD use [9]. This examination allows diagnosing Actinomycoses quite early. Treatment <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> simpler and results are better.|$|R
5000|$|The {{candidates}} {{present in}} either outcome are Andrea, Carter, Delilah and Brad. Scott <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> excluded and his votes transfer to Delilah. Carter's surplus is then transferred {{and goes to}} Brad. The final scores <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|Granites are {{cooler and}} <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> {{less able to}} melt and {{assimilate}} country rocks. Wholesale contamination <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> minor and unusual, although mixing of granitic and basaltic melts is not unknown where basalt is injected into granitic magma chambers.|$|R
30|$|The proof <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> completed.|$|R
60|$|All entirely bad {{works of}} art may be divided into those which, professing to be imaginative, bear no stamp of imagination, and <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> false, and those which, professing to be {{representative}} of matter, miss of the representation and <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> nugatory.|$|R

5000|$|The {{candidates}} {{present in}} at least one outcome are Andrea, Carter, Brad and Scott. Delilah <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> excluded. Eight of her votes transfer to Brad and five to Scott. Carter's surplus is then transferred and goes to Brad. The final scores <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|Nothing, {{specifically}} Pure Nothing, [...] "is simply equality with itself, complete emptiness, {{absence of}} all determination and content." [...] It <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> identical with <b>Being,</b> {{except that it}} is thought of as its very opposite. This distinction <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> meaningful as posited by thought.|$|R

50|$|This <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> {{an unusual}} house for Spain, one that {{existed at the}} same time as the great Italian houses or villas.

5000|$|Consider {{an ideal}} {{inverting}} voltage amplifier of gain [...] with an impedance [...] connected between its {{input and output}} nodes.

5000|$|... 2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine {{is listed}} as a Scheduled I {{controlled}} substance {{at the federal level}} in the United States and <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> illegal to buy, possess, and sell. 2,4-dimethoxyamphetamine, 2,6-dimethoxyamphetamine, 3,4-dimethoxyamphetamine, and 3,5-dimethoxyamphetamine are each position isomers of 2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine, they <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> all Schedule I controlled substances as well.|$|R

50|$|Italian is a Romance language, and <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> a {{descendant}} of Vulgar Latin (the spoken form of non-classical Latin). Standard Italian is based on Tuscan, especially its Florentine dialect, and <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> an Italo-Dalmatian language, to which Sicilian and the extinct Dalmatian also belong, among a few others.|$|R
50|$|The first subnet {{obtained}} from subnetting has all bits in the subnet bit group set to zero (0). It <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> called subnet zero. The last subnet {{obtained from}} subnetting has all bits in the subnet bit group set to one (1). It <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> called the all-ones subnet.|$|R
5000|$|... v-Src {{lacks the}} C-terminal {{inhibitory}} phosphorylation site (tyrosine-527), and <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> constitutively active {{as opposed to}} normal Src (c-Src) which is only activated under certain circumstances where it is required (e.g. growth factor signaling). v-Src <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> an instructive example of an oncogene whereas c-Src is a proto-oncogene.|$|R
