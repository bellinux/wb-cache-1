50|$|The Canon de 130 mm Modèle 1924 had an autofretted {{built-up}} {{barrel and}} a Welin breech block. Useful life expectancy was 900 effective full charges (EFC) per barrel. These guns were carried in low-angle single turrets on destroyers. They had an <b>automatic</b> <b>spring</b> rammer, but loading was difficult at elevations over 15°.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1935 and 1938, {{the company}} {{introduced}} {{a long list}} of valve and thermostat products, including <b>automatic</b> <b>spring</b> valves, ball float valves, pressure-controlled valves, diaphragm valves, suction valves, constant-pressure valves, room thermostats and drying filters. A logo reading [...] "Danfoss"—a portmanteau of the Danish words [...] "Danmark" [...] (Denmark) and [...] "fosser" [...] (to stream or sparkle)—was attached to all valves.|$|R
50|$|The Mle 1927 {{was used}} in single centre-pivot {{mountings}} that weighed approximately 13 t that were fitted with a 3 mm thick gun shield. The mount could depress -10° and elevate to +28° which gave it a maximum range of 16600 m. The gun had a firing cycle of 4 or 5 seconds with its <b>automatic</b> <b>spring</b> rammer, but the dredger hoists transporting the shells and cartridge cases slowed the rate of fire down to 8-10 rounds per minute.|$|R

The gun had a nominal firing cycle of 4 or 5 seconds with its <b>automatic</b> <b>spring</b> rammer, but the dredger hoists transporting the shells and cartridge cases slowed the rate of fire down to 7 rounds per minute. This gun was only used on the large destroyers (contre-torpilleurs) of the Fantasque class.|$|R
5000|$|An {{automatic}} OTF {{knife blade}} travels within an internal track or channel {{in the same}} manner as a manual slider or gravity knife. But the <b>automatic</b> main <b>spring</b> drive and button mechanism enclosed within requires a switchblade handle to be thicker or longer than a similar size gravity or sliding knife. The term [...] "Slider" [...] is usually not applied ...|$|R

60|$|The boy {{knocked at}} a door, {{and the door}} {{promptly}} opened with a <b>spring</b> and a <b>click.</b> A parlour door within a small entry stood open, and disclosed a child--a dwarf--a girl--a something--sitting on a little low old-fashioned arm-chair, which {{had a kind of}} little working bench before it.|$|R

50|$|Vacuum {{modulators}} in some transmissions {{were essential}} {{in the proper}} operation of many <b>automatic</b> transmissions.

2500|$|One of {{the first}} one handed devices was the <b>automatic</b> <b>spring</b> release, {{also known as a}} switchblade. An {{innovation}} to pocket knives made possible by the thumb-stud is the replaceable blade insert developed in 1999 by Steven Overholt (U.S. Patent no. 6,574,868), originally marketed by TigerSharp Technologies and as of 2007 by Clauss. Some systems are somewhat between assisted opening and the normal thumb stud. CRKT knives designed by Harold [...] "Kit" [...] Carson often incorporate a [...] "Carson Flipper", which is a small protrusion on the rear of the base of the blade such that it protrudes out the obverse side of the handle (when closed). By using an index finger and a very slight snapping of the wrist, the knife opens very quickly, appearing to operate like a spring assisted knife. When opened, the protrusion is between the base of the sharp blade and the user's index finger, preventing any accidental slipping of the hand onto the blade. Some designs feature a second [...] "Flipper" [...] {{on the opposite side of}} the blade, forming a small [...] "hilt guard" [...] such as a fixed blade knife has, which can prevent another blade from sliding up into the hilt in combat.|$|R
2500|$|Police {{encountered}} Freddie Gray on {{the morning}} of April 12, 2015, in the street near Baltimore's Gilmor Homes housing project, an area known to have high levels of home foreclosures, poverty, drug deals and violent crime. According to the charging documents submitted by the Baltimore police, at 8:39a.m Lieutenant Brian W. Rice, Officer Edward Nero, and Officer Garrett E. Miller were patrolling on bicycles and made eye contact with Gray, who proceeded to flee on foot [...] "unprovoked upon noticing police presence". After a brief chase, Gray was apprehended and taken into custody [...] "without the use of force or incident", according to Officer Garret Miller, who wrote he [...] "noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his [...] front right pocket". In the formal statement of charges, Officer Miller stated that Gray [...] "did unlawfully carry, possess, and sell a knife commonly known as a switch blade knife, with an <b>automatic</b> <b>spring</b> or other device for opening and/or closing the blade within the limits of Baltimore City. The knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring assisted one hand operated knife." [...] According to the state's attorney for Baltimore City, the spring-assisted knife Gray was carrying was legal under Maryland law, while a police task force said the knife was a violation of the Baltimore code under which Gray was charged.|$|R
500|$|In late March, {{he was one}} {{of three}} {{pitchers}} vying for one long relief spot on the team, though the Rangers also began experimenting with converting him to be a starter. [...] General Manager Jon Daniels observed: [...] "Toward the end of <b>spring</b> training something <b>clicked</b> with his new [...] arm slot." [...] On March 22, despite Feldman's success with his new, higher arm angle, the Rangers optioned him to Oklahoma, where he was a starter. [...] In April he bounced back and forth between Texas and Frisco.|$|R
50|$|Umbrellas and parasols are {{primarily}} hand-held portable devices sized for personal use. The largest hand-portable umbrellas are golf umbrellas. Umbrellas {{can be divided}} into two categories: fully collapsible umbrellas, in which the metal pole supporting the canopy retracts, making the umbrella small enough to fit in a handbag; and non-collapsible umbrellas, in which the support pole cannot retract and only the canopy can be collapsed. Another distinction can be made between manually operated umbrellas and spring-loaded <b>automatic</b> umbrellas which <b>spring</b> open at the press of a button.|$|R
60|$|With rapid, but {{noiseless}} steps, she sped {{down the}} stairs. The hall was empty. She knelt {{down upon the}} hearth with breathless eagerness; the tongue of the iron dog was unscrewed, and the <b>spring</b> <b>clicked</b> in another instant; then a trembling passing of the fingers {{at the back of}} the mantel piece; in a few moments she felt the projecting nob, and the door swung round on its hinges beside her. Taking up her candle, she flew up the narrow steps; she had no fear now of interruption from below, for no one passing through the hall would notice that open door in the fireplace. Up the first flight, into the secret chamber, and then up again. She knelt down upon the third step, and then looked at the wall by the step above her. The slight projection was visible, she pressed it, and the step rolled back, and disclosed a sort of receptacle, the width of the stair, and about a foot deep, filled with papers. She turned these over, her breath held, her hands trembling with excitement, her eyes staring and wild. The first three or four which she threw out were leases and deeds; the next that she came to was a bulky packet endorsed upon its back--The last Will and Testament of Herbert Harmer. Sophy seized it with a short sharp cry of delight, and then hurried down into the hall again. She closed the iron door behind her; blew out the candle, placed it on the table; and then opened the hall door, and without hat or covering on her head she flew down the drive at the top of her speed. She had it then at last, after all these years; it was hers, hers and her boy's! and Sophy with the greatest difficulty repressed the wild cries of delight which rose to her lips. Once past the lodge she kept on at her full speed towards the village, but when she reached the top of the hill she paused to listen. Below her she could see the bright lamps of an approaching vehicle, and in the still night air could hear the noise of a vehicle coming up the hill, and a man's voice urging the horse to his best speed. So she was only just in time. Father Eustace had returned. She hid herself behind a hedge, and as they came along, she could tell by the laboured breathing of the horse how fast he had been driven, and she could even catch what the men, who were walking up the hill to relieve it, were saying. The first voice she heard was that of the priest.|$|R
40|$|Agricultural vehicle {{manufacturers}} are employing new semi-active cab suspensions using Magnetorheological (MR) technology. The use of MR technology in cab suspensions {{is a logical}} next step in improving operator safety and comfort. The speed and simplicity of MR technology {{enables the use of}} low-stiffness springs without the compromise between ride and stability, and can provide roll, isolation and pitch stability. MR fluids are materials that respond to a magnetic field with a dramatic change in rheological behavior. These fluids can reversibly change instantaneously from a free-flowing liquid to a semi-solid with controllable yield strength when exposed to a magnetic field. MR systems have been developed with a modular, integrated approach that can include a damper containing MR fluid, air <b>spring,</b> <b>automatic</b> electronic leveling, sensors, controller, and CANbus data communication...|$|R
