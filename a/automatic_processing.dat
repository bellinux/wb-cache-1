5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the <b>automatic</b> <b>processing</b> of information (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
2500|$|Lead-Finder {{software}} is an integrated solution for simulating structure and binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes. The software combines <b>automatic</b> <b>processing</b> of protein structures, extra precision protein-ligand docking and calculation of free energy of ligand binding. Original docking algorithm provides a fast rate of calculations, {{which can be}} easily adjusted from more rapid (for virtual screening applications) to slightly more slow and robust, while unique scoring function implemented in Lead-Finder provides unsurpassed accuracy of calculations.|$|E
2500|$|Military {{applications}} are {{probably one of}} the largest areas for computer vision. The obvious examples are detection of enemy soldiers or vehicles and missile guidance. More advanced systems for missile guidance send the missile to an area rather than a specific target, and target selection is made when the missile reaches the area based on locally acquired image data. Modern military concepts, such as [...] "battlefield awareness", imply that various sensors, including image sensors, provide a rich set of information about a combat scene which can be used to support strategic decisions. In this case, <b>automatic</b> <b>processing</b> of the data is used to reduce complexity and to fuse information from multiple sensors to increase reliability.|$|E

2500|$|Linguistic tasks can invoke speech disfluency. [...] People who stutter may {{experience}} varying disfluency. [...] Tasks that trigger disfluency usually require a controlled-language processing, which involves linguistic planning. In stuttering, {{it is seen}} that many individuals do not demonstrate disfluencies {{when it comes to}} tasks that allow for <b>automatic</b> <b>processing</b> without substantial planning. For example, singing [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] or other relatively common, repeated linguistic discourses, could be fluid in people who stutter. [...] Tasks like this reduce semantic, syntactic, and prosodic planning, whereas spontaneous, [...] "controlled" [...] speech or reading aloud requires thoughts to transform into linguistic material and thereafter syntax and prosody. [...] Some researchers hypothesize that controlled-language activated circuitry consistently does not function properly in people who stutter, whereas people who do not stutter only sometimes display disfluent speech and abnormal circuitry.|$|E
