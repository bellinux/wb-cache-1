5|$|In February 1989, the Walt Disney Concert Hall Committee {{selected}} Dworsky {{as executive}} architect {{to work with}} designated architect Frank Gehry in designing the future home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Dworsky was selected to translate Gehry's conceptual designs into working drawings that would meet building code specifications. By 1994, {{the cost of the}} project had skyrocketed to $160 million (it eventually reached $274 million), and controversy halted the project. By 1996, a major donor was sought to complete the project by 2001 (four years behind schedule). Gehry and his design came under fire, and some considered him <b>a</b> <b>spoiled,</b> impractical artist.|$|E

Their principal, Thunderbite (also voiced by Snyder), is an oversized, skull-shaped robot who, when not causing pain, acts sweet and motherly to the students. Megawatt (also voiced by Sinterniklaas) is <b>a</b> <b>spoiled</b> rich kid who is attractive to the female robots, most of whom he blows up; to Thrasher's disdain, he is dating Maimy. Tacklebot (Roger Craig Smith), Megawatt's friend and musclehead jock, acts violent and hostile toward the protagonists.|$|E

During the show's second season, the character becomes romantically involved with her friend Ross, with whom she maintains a complicated on-again, off-again relationship throughout the entire series.

5|$|Originally {{conceived}} as <b>a</b> <b>spoiled,</b> materialistic princess, the writers eventually re-wrote Jasmine into a {{stronger and more}} prominent heroine following the elimination of Aladdin's mother from the script, while borrowing story elements from the romantic comedy Roman Holiday (1953). Several months after securing the role, Larkin was nearly fired from the project because Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg felt that her voice was not suitable for a princess, but Clements and Musker managed to convince him otherwise. Discovered by casting director Albert Tavares, Salonga was cast as Jasmine's singing voice based on her performance in the musical Miss Saigon; this unprecedented casting decision made Jasmine the first Disney character to have her speaking and singing voices provided by two different actors. Animated by Mark Henn, Jasmine's design is an eclectic combination of unique sources, including an anonymous theme park guest, Henn's own sister, and actress Jennifer Connelly, while elements of the Taj Mahal were incorporated into the character's hair, clothing and physique.|$|E

25|$|The {{tragedy of}} Lear's lack of {{understanding}} of the consequences of his demands and actions is often observed to be like that of <b>a</b> <b>spoiled</b> child, but it has also been noted that his behaviour is equally likely to be seen in parents who have never adjusted to their children having grown up.|$|E
25|$|Jonathan Miller's 1972 Chichester Festival Theatre production, {{starring}} Joan Plowright and Anthony Hopkins.

25|$|Between {{historians and}} novelists, Joan has {{appeared}} in various texts as either an independent and spirited woman or <b>a</b> <b>spoiled</b> brat. In Lives of the Princesses of England by Mary Anne Everett Green, Joan is portrayed as a “giddy princess” and neglectful mother. Many have agreed to this characterization; however, some authors think {{there is little evidence}} to support the assumption that Joan of Acre was a neglectful or uncaring mother.|$|E

25|$|In the {{standard}} Akkadian {{version of the}} Epic of Gilgamesh, Ishtar is portrayed as <b>a</b> <b>spoiled</b> and hot-headed femme fatale who demands Gilgamesh become her consort.

This stands in sharp contrast with Inanna's radically different portrayal in the earlier Sumerian epic of Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld. Ishtar also appears in the Hittite creation myth and in the Neo-Assyrian Birth Legend of Sargon.|$|E
