5|$|<b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>recent</b> proposal, the exomembrane hypothesis, {{suggests}} that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane; the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as ribosomal subunits.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>recent</b> theory, {{with broad}} support among archaeologists, is that Celtic culture and {{language}} arrived in Ireland {{as a result}} of cultural diffusion.

5|$|In phylogenetic taxonomy, {{the genus}} Triceratops {{has been used}} as a {{reference}} point in the definition of Dinosauria; dinosaurs have been designated as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of Triceratops and Neornithes (i.e. modern birds).

5|$|The total world {{population}} {{was estimated to}} be between 5,000 and 12,000 in 2002; there are high levels of uncertainty in available estimates for many areas. <b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>recent</b> estimate by the IUCN puts the global population at 10,000–25,000.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>recent</b> {{development}} is the electric action which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), {{in which case the}} action is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|E

To {{mark the beginning of}} the festival on Friday at 5 pm, there is the Lantern Lighting Procession that starts on the Steep and continues through the village until all the lanterns in the streets have been lit. The procession of children and their families is accompanied by colourful stilt walkers in costumes who put up the lanterns.|$|E
5|$|According to one source, JG 4′s {{losses were}} 25 fighters of the 55 that took part.

Two Ju 88 pathfinders were lost, as well as 26 fighters with six more damaged.|$|E
5|$|Curium is {{produced}} in small quantities in nuclear reactors, and by now only kilograms of it have been accumulated for the 242Cm and 244Cm and grams or even milligrams for heavier isotopes. This explains {{the high price of}} curium, which has been quoted at 160–185 USD per milligram, with <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>recent</b> estimate at 2,000 USD/g for 242Cm and 170 USD/g for 244Cm. In nuclear reactors, curium is formed from 238U in a series of nuclear reactions. In the first chain, 238U captures a neutron and converts into 239U, which via β− decay transforms into 239Np and 239Pu.|$|E

5|$|HIP 78530 is a bright, blue B-type main {{sequence}} {{star in the}} Upper Scorpius association, a loose star cluster composed of stars with a common origin. The star {{is estimated to be}} approximately 2.5 times the mass of the Sun. Ages of the Upper Scorpius group have been quoted at 5 million years, however <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>recent</b> estimate suggests that the group is somewhat older (approximately 11 million years old). Its effective temperature is estimated at 10500 K, less than twice the effective temperature of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Historian Wilhelm Levison, {{writing in}} 1946, was sceptical about the {{authenticity}} of this charter. In particular, {{he felt that the}} two separate addresses were incongruous and suggested that the first address, occurring before the preamble, may have been inserted by someone familiar with Bede to echo Eadbald's future conversion (see below). <b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>recent</b> and more positive appraisal by John Morris argues that the charter and its witness list are authentic because it incorporates titles and phraseology that had fallen out of use by 800.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Sanford Myron Zeller {{circumscribed}} the {{new family}} Mycenastraceae, containing both Mycenastrum as the type genus, and Bovista. A 2001 molecular study supported {{the inclusion of}} Mycenastrum corium in the Lycoperdales, where it was traditionally placed. In <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>recent</b> (2008) cladistic analysis, Mycenastrum was {{shown to be a}} sister group to the Lycoperdaceae; authors Larsson and Jeppson agreed with Zeller (1949) and Pilat's (1958) decision to regard Mycenastrium as a monotypic genus in the separate family Mycenastraceae. Despite this, several taxonomic authorities prefer to fold Mycenastraceae into the Agaricaceae.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor's Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor in Chad {{reported}} that school attendance of children aged 5 to 14 was {{as low as}} 39%.

5|$|In {{identifying}} the remains {{as those of}} Palaeoscincus, Broom initially classified Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, a statement backed {{by the research of}} Coombs in the 1970s. However, in 1929, Nopcsa identified the taxon as a stegosaurid, with which most modern studies agree. In 1981, the genus was reviewed with modern taxonomy, and found to be a valid genus of stegosaurid. However, <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>recent</b> 2008 review of Stegosauria could only identify one distinguishing feature, and while that study still referred it to Stegosauridae based on similarity, no diagnostic features of the family could be identified in Paranthodon.|$|E

5|$|Populations {{of stars}} have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are {{observed}} {{as they were}} in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>recent</b> state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.|$|E
