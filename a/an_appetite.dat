40|$|<b>A</b> poor <b>appetite</b> {{in older}} adults is an {{important}} determinant of reduced food intake and undernutrition. Food preferences may influence food intake. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate food preferences of older adults with <b>a</b> poor <b>appetite</b> and compare these with preferences of older adults with <b>a</b> good <b>appetite.</b> Older adults (n = 349, aged 65 - 101 years) in nursing/residential care homes, hospitals or at home receiving home care participated in a computer-based forced-choice food preference assessment. Self-reported appetite in the past week was classified as 'good' or 'poor' using a validated instrument. Food preferences were determined by counting the relative frequency of choices for food images according to 11 dichotomous categories: high/low 1) protein; 2) fat; 3) carbohydrates; 4) fiber; 5) variation; and 6) animal/vegetarian proteins; 7) sweet/savory taste; 8) solid/liquid texture; 9) dairy/non-dairy; with/without 10) sauce or 11) color variation. Specific food preferences in participants with <b>a</b> poor <b>appetite</b> were identified by one-sample t-tests comparing frequencies to the expected value of 48. Preference differences between those with a good and <b>a</b> poor <b>appetite</b> were analyzed using GLM adjusting for confounders. The results showed that older adults with <b>a</b> poor <b>appetite</b> (n = 113; 32. 4 %) preferred variation (51. 6 vs. 48, P < 0. 001), color variation (55. 9 vs. 48, P < 0. 01), non-dairy (53. 0 vs. 48, P < 0. 001), high-fiber (51. 8 vs. 48, P < 0. 05), and solid texture (53. 5 vs. 48, P < 0. 05). Participants with <b>a</b> poor <b>appetite</b> had <b>a</b> higher frequency score for variation than participants with <b>a</b> good <b>appetite</b> (51. 6 vs. 48. 5, P < 0. 001). In conclusion, older adults with <b>a</b> poor <b>appetite</b> may have specific food preferences. Their preference for variation differs from those with <b>a</b> good <b>appetite.</b> These results may be used to develop meals that are preferred by older adults with poor appetite in order to increase food intake and prevent undernutrition...|$|R

Not all dyes were costly, however, and most Romans wore colourful clothing. Clean, bright clothing was a mark of respectability and status among all social classes. The fastenings and brooches used to secure garments such as cloaks provided further opportunities for personal embellishment and display.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{throughout}} {{the early and}} mid 1950s, the Royal Air Force (RAF) had developed an intense desire to advance {{the performance of their}} aircraft; in particular, the service sought new fighter aircraft that would be capable of routinely flying at very high speeds and high altitudes as a long term replacement for its existing inventory of roughly 700 first-generation jet fighters. At the time, there was a perception that Britain was trailing behind in supersonic aircraft design, and there was pressure to correct this. Events such as the Korean War and rapid advances in the fields of supersonic aerodynamics, structures and aero engines by the British aircraft industry had the effect of increasing demand and the potential capabilities of new fighters. In addition to developing improved versions of existing and emerging fighters such as the Hawker Hunter and Gloster Javelin, there was <b>an</b> <b>appetite</b> for even more promising entirely new aircraft.|$|E

500|$|As a child, Zelda Sayre was {{extremely}} active. She danced, took ballet lessons {{and enjoyed the}} outdoors. In 1914, Sayre began attending Sidney Lanier High School. She was bright, but uninterested in her lessons. Her work in ballet continued into high school, where she had an active social life.

Although this varies by location, many populations share <b>an</b> <b>appetite</b> for {{fish from the}} mullet, the tuna and mackerel, and the drum and croaker families. Its cone-like teeth serve to grasp, but do not chew food. When they encounter a shoal of fish, they {{work as a team}} to herd them towards the shore to maximize the harvest. They also hunt alone, often targeting bottom-dwelling species. The bottlenose dolphin sometimes hits a fish with its fluke, sometimes knocking it out of the water, using a strategy called [...] "fish whacking". [...] "Strand feeding", is an inherited feeding technique used by bottlenose dolphins near and around coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina. When a pod finds a school of fish, they will circle the school and trap the fish in a mini whirlpool. Then, the dolphins will charge at the school and push their bodies up onto a mud-flat, forcing the fish on the mud-flat, as well. The dolphins then crawl around on their sides, consuming the fish they washed up on shore.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} any changes in appetite or food selection that occur among college students when they experience psychological distress. A total of 315 students were surveyed, and 304 of the surveys were usable. The subjects included 280 females, 23 males, and one subject did not indicate gender. A survey was posted on the internet. The survey only allowed access to Ball State University students who have a valid username and password. The survey asked questions including demographics, stress level, typical eating habits and eating habits when stressed. The results indicated that most subjects (79. 9 %) experience <b>a</b> change in <b>appetite</b> when stressed with over half of the subjects (50. 3 %) experiencing <b>an</b> increased <b>appetite.</b> Those subjects that experienced <b>an</b> increase in <b>appetite</b> chose significantly more sweet dishes than those who experienced <b>a</b> decreased <b>appetite</b> or no change in appetite. They also chose significantly more mixed dishes than those with <b>a</b> decreased <b>appetite.</b> Although 78. 6 % of subjects claim they typically try to make healthy eating choices, 60. 3 % of these subjects do not make the same attempt when stressed. This study found that a larger percentage of women than men claimed to have <b>an</b> increased <b>appetite</b> when stressed while a larger percentage of men than women claimed they experience no change in appetite when stressed. Also, a larger percentage of overweight subjects claimed they experience <b>an</b> increased <b>appetite</b> when stressed compared to normal weight and underweight subjects. However, neither of these results was significant. This study found no difference in eating habits and food choices between restrained and unrestrained eaters. The information in this study is helpful to health professional who address stress level and/or eating habits in their clients; however, it poses many new questions that require further study.
