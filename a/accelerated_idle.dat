Was analyzed a sample of Dacia Logan passenger cars (n = 515), made during the period 2004 - 2007, equipped with spark ignition engines, assigned to emission standards EURO 3 (E 3) and EURO 4 (E 4). These cars were evaluated at periodical technical inspection (ITP) by two times in the two walk regimes (slow idle and <b>accelerated</b> <b>idle).</b> Using the t test for paired samples (Paired Samples T Test), {{the results showed that}} there are significant differences between emissions levels (CO, CO 2, HC) generated by Dacia Logan passenger cars at both assessments, and regression analysis showed that these differences are not significantly influenced by turnover differences...|$|E

50|$|The engine had {{variable}} {{inlet guide}} vanes, as used on many other engines, necessary for <b>accelerating</b> from <b>idle</b> to high thrust. However, on the Gyron Junior, {{positioning of the}} vanes was not reliable and could cause surging which, in turn, could prevent accelerating to higher thrust levels. A possibly unique feature on this engine was valve-controlled cooling air to the turbine blades. The engine had to supply air for the aircraft's boundary layer control system and the resulting thrust loss was unacceptable. To regain the thrust the turbine temperature limit was raised by using turbine blade cooling, selected only with blowing on.|$|R
50|$|Four-stroking is {{less likely}} with {{compression}} ignition engines (i.e. diesel engines) than it is with spark-ignition engines (i.e. petrol engines). Diesel engines are also rare as the small two-strokes where inertial scavenging is used. When large two-stroke diesel engines are used, these have scavenging by forced induction and so are generally immune to four-stroking when idling at low speed or low power. These scavenge blowers may be mechanically-driven Roots blowers or turbochargers. As a turbocharger has some lag time coming up to speed, turbo-charged two-stroke diesels often display four-stroking when starting, or when suddenly <b>accelerating</b> from <b>idle.</b> Some large engines, such as those from EMD, minimize this by using a turbocharger with an auxiliary mechanical drive to give better scavenging at low rpm.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the on-road emissions and fuel consumption of a Euro 4 petrol car driven on four typical urban routes in Hong Kong. The effects of road grade and traffic condition on the emissions and fuel consumption are examine {{and show that}} the hilly route has the greatest CO and HC emissions and the highest fuel consumption per unit distance traveled. The urban route is the second highest in CO emission and fuel consumption due to significant idling and low-speed operation, and the frequent acceleration and deceleration changes. It is also found that higher NO. x emission is associated with deceleration events which cause lean operation while higher CO emission is associated with <b>accelerating</b> from <b>idle</b> which causes rich operation. HC and fuel consumption peaks are associated with acceleration. Department of Civil and Environmental EngineeringDepartment of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|Taxi {{operations}} are accomplished using the electronic {{nose wheel steering}}. The steering system on aircraft without variable authority nose wheel steering requires the pilot to select master or primary steering mode. In master mode, 10 degrees of steering is possible. This mode is suitable for straight taxi, takeoff and gentle turns. Primary steering mode allows up to 45 degrees angle of turn and is suitable for slow speed aggressive steering maneuvers. On aircraft equipped with variable authority steering, the steering authority varies with ground speed.The CJ610-6 engines fitted to the Learjet 25 have very low inertia and accelerate rapidly. The time required to <b>accelerate</b> from <b>idle</b> to 100% RPM is approximately four seconds. This excellent throttle response enables rapid acceleration and precise power settings. Single engine performance is good with the single engine rate of climb approximately 1700 feet per minute at gross weight at sea level and a single engine service ceiling of approximately 21500 feet.|$|R

In November 2015, the NHTSA rescheduled one more time because additional coordination is necessary. A final ruling was delayed at least until mid-March 2016. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued its final rule in November 2016, mandating that all hybrids and EVs must emit artificial noise when <b>idling,</b> <b>accelerating</b> to [...] or going in reverse by September 2019.|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{analysis}} of emissions and fuel consumption from motor vehicles using a modal approach. The four standard driving modes are <b>idling,</b> <b>accelerating,</b> cruising, and decelerating. On-road data were collected using instrumented test vehicles traveling many times through the urban areas of Hong Kong. A model was developed for estimating vehicular fuel consumption and emissions {{as a function of}} instantaneous speed and driving mode. Piecewise interpolation functions were proposed for each nonidling driving mode. Idling emission and fuel consumption rates were estimated as negative exponential functions of idling time. Preliminary modeling results showed good agreements for the test vehicles and indicated that the on-road measurements are feasible for the development of modal emission and fuel consumption models.

This study explores both vehicle delay and emissions near signalized intersections by using the cell transmission model (CTM). CTM {{is a kind of}} mesoscopic traffic simulation model that offers the advantage of simplicity and computation speed compared with microscopic models and accuracy compared with macroscopic models. To validate the effectiveness of CTM in modeling delay and emissions, comparisons with a microscopic car following model and macroscopic models, are carried out on a real road network in Hong Kong. The numerical results are encouraging, demonstrating the ability of CTM for evaluating delay and emission in signalized intersections...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} project was to develop and test an online, automated taxi movement planning tool, that optimizes the timed taxiing routes of all aircraft on an airport, by minimizing {{the impact on the}} environment. Automatic taxi planning tools have been developed before, but the emissions have never been included before as a factor in the optimal taxi planning. Since the tool is to be used in real-time in an operational context, the daily operations of airports have been analyzed and the tool has been tailor-made to meet the operational requirements. In order to cope with perturbations on the taxiway grid, the tool is capable of optimizing a taxi planning within 15 seconds. This way, a new planning can be calculated quickly if there are perturbations on the taxiway grid. The objective function comprises the following criteria: 9 ̆ 5 Minimization of the emissions (normalized and weighted in the objective function) 9 ̆ 5 For departures: minimization of the absolute deviation from the departure slot time 9 ̆ 5 For arrivals: minimization of the taxiing time (normalized in the objective function) The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) methodology has been used to formulate and solve the problem. The formulation in {{this research}} project uses binary routing variables and continuous timing variables. This way, the routing and scheduling problem can be solved without the disadvantages of discrete time. The emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (UHC), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and particulate matter (PM) are included in the optimization. The developed optimizer minimizes those five emissions, along with fuel burn, delays for departures and taxiing times for arrivals. The environmental variables are modeled using an action-based model, in which the emissions caused by <b>accelerating,</b> <b>idling</b> during a hold, taxiing at constant speed and turning have been modeled. The developed tool has been subjected to a comprehensive test case. The test case simulated a full day of flights on a major European hub: Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The output of each emission type increased with only 1 to 2 percent, in comparison to the theoretical optimum (which is a scenario where each flight would be able to travel its optimal, unimpeded route, unhindered by separation constraints). When the emission optimization criteria were switched off (while keeping the objective criteria of arrivals taxiing time and departure slot time deviation), the output of each emission type increased with around 20 to 25 percent, in comparison to emission-enabled optimization. The computational times remained within limits, so the requirement was met of having the ability to do a replanning every 15 seconds. The environmental benefit of using this type of optimizer is estimated to be around 10 to 20 percent per emission type. The reduction {{can be attributed to the}} elimination of the buffering and waiting queues in front of runways, the elimination of holds at nodes and the intelligent overall routing, timing, sequencing and scheduling on the taxiway grid. Therefore, this research project proves that a surface movement planning tool, which minimizes the emissions or the total taxiing time, can be valuable for airports that have dense taxiing traffic and stringent environmental requirements.

40|$|One {{adult male}} inhales about 10. 8 m 3 of air per day. Therefore, {{achieving}} good air quality {{is a global}} concern from a health point of view. As {{one of the most}} prevalent toxic pollution sources are emissions from diesel fleets, researchers have been introducing various approaches to reduce the exhaust emission, such as introducing new fuels and engine modifications (Ristovski, 2012). Most of the current research has focused on emission reduction methods in steady-state operating modes; however, the daily driving schedule of automotive and truck vehicles is inherently unsteady. Moreover, the most critical conditions encountered by engines are met during transient operations. Despite the increased complexity, results from tests involving transient operation are more closely related to reality than steady-state testing, in most cases (Giakoumis, 2012). Generally, transient operation could refer to operating conditions that are not steady-state, such as: free acceleration, load changes, cold start and driving cycles. For example, cold start emissions from a heavy duty vehicle reported to be 15 times higher than their steady-state values (Giakoumis, 2012). This study intends to show the effect of transient operation on exhaust particulate emission by adapting the stall test, as outlined in MDG 29, Guideline for the management of diesel engine pollutants in underground environments in New South Wales-Australia (MDG 29, 2008), to a repeatable engine testbed drive cycle. For this implementation, the stall test is designed to be performed on three speeds, (1500, 2000 and 2400) with a similar pattern. At each speed the engine is on idle for 20 s, then <b>accelerated</b> from <b>idle</b> to full load (100...|$|R

Despite flying a route between the two areas of heavy precipitation shown on radar, they encountered heavy rain, hail, and turbulence. Passing through 16500 ft, both engines flamed out, leaving the jet gliding with neither engine producing thrust or electrical power. The auxiliary power unit (APU) was started as the plane descended through 10500 ft, restoring electrical power. While attempts to [...] "windmill start" [...] the engines using the airflow generated by the plane's descent were unsuccessful, the pilots were later able to start them using the engine starters, which were powered by the APU. However, neither engine would <b>accelerate</b> to normal <b>idle</b> speed, much less to a point where it was producing meaningful thrust. Attempts to advance the throttles only resulted in overheating of the engines, so they were once more shut down to avoid catastrophic failure. The pilots landed the airliner in an unpowered glide on top of a narrow grass levee adjacent to NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in the Michoud area of eastern New Orleans near the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and brought the airplane to a safe stop.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Quantification of disproportionate {{contribution}} made by signalised traffic intersections (TIs) {{to overall}} daily commuting exposure is important but barely known. We carried out mobile measurements {{in a car}} for size–resolved particle number concentrations (PNCs) in the 5 – 560  nm range under five different ventilation settings on a 6  km long busy round route with 10 TIs. These ventilation settings were windows fully open and both outdoor air intake from fan and heating off (Set 1), windows closed, fan 25 % on and heating 50 % on (Set 2), windows closed, fan 100 % on and heating off (Set 3), windows closed, fan off and heating 100 % on (Set 4), and windows closed, fan and heating off (Set 5). Measurements were taken sequentially {{inside and outside the}} car cabin at 10  Hz sampling rate using a solenoid switching system in conjunction with a fast response differential mobility spectrometer (DMS 50). The objectives were to: (i) identify traffic conditions under which TIs becomes hot–spots of PNCs, (ii) assess the effect of ventilation settings in free–flow and delay conditions (waiting time at a TI when traffic signal is red) on in–cabin PNCs with respect to on–road PNCs at TIs, (iii) deriving the relationship between the PNCs and change in driving speed during delay time at the TIs, and (iv) quantify the contribution of exposure at TIs with respect to overall commuting exposure. Congested TIs were found to become hot–spots when vehicle <b>accelerate</b> from <b>idling</b> conditions. In–cabin peak PNCs followed similar temporal trend as for on–road peak PNCs. Reduction in in–cabin PNC with respect to outside PNC was highest (70 %) during free–flow traffic conditions when both fan drawing outdoor air into the cabin and heating was switched off. Such a reduction in in–cabin PNCs at TIs was highest (88 %) with respect to outside PNC during delay conditions when fan was drawing outside air at 25 % on and heating was 50 % on settings. PNCs and change in driving speed showed an exponential–fit relationship during the delay events at TIs. Short–term exposure for ∼ 2 % of total commuting time in car corresponded to ∼ 25 % of total respiratory doses. This study highlights a need for more studies covering diverse traffic and geographical conditions in urban environments so that the disparate contribution of exposure at TIs can be quantified...|$|R
40|$|Traffic-related air {{pollution}} {{is now a}} major concern. The Rio Earth Summit and the Government's commitment to Agenda 21 has led to Local Authorities taking responsibility to manage {{the growing number of}} vehicles and to reduce the impact of traffic on the environment. There is an urgent need to effectively monitor urban air quality at reasonable cost and to develop long and short term {{air pollution}} prediction models. The aim of the research described was to investigate relationships between traffic characteristics and kerbside air pollution concentrations. Initially, the only pollution monitoring equipment available was basic and required constant supervision. The traffic data was made available from the demand-responsive traffic signal control systems in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. However, {{it was found that the}} surveys were too short to produce statistically significant results, and no useful conclusions could be drawn. Subsequently, an automatic, remote kerbside monitoring system was developed specifically for this research. The data collected was analysed using multiple regression techniques in an attempt to obtain an empirical relationship which could be used to predict roadside pollution concentrations from traffic and meteorological data. However, the residual series were found to be autocorrelated, which meant that the statistical tests were invalid. It was then found to be possible to fit an accurate model to the data using time series analysis, but that it could not predict levels even in the short-term. Finally, a semi-empirical model was developed by estimating the proportion of vehicles passing a point in each operating mode (cruising, <b>accelerating,</b> decelerating and <b>idling)</b> and using real data to derive the coefficients. Unfortunately, it was again not possible to define a reliable predictive relationship. However, suggestions have been made about how this research could be progressed to achieve its aim...|$|R
40|$|The DRACULA traffic {{simulator}} is a microscopic model {{in that the}} vehicles are individually represented. The movement of vehicles in the network are represented continuously and updated every one second. The network is modelled {{as a set of}} nodes and links which represent junctions and streets respectively. Vehicles are generated at their origins with a random headway distribution and are assigned a set of driver/vehicle characteristics (according to user-specified probabilities) and a fixed route. The movement of the vehicles on a network is governed by a car-following law, the gap acceptance rules and the traffic regulations at intersections. They can join a queue, change lane, discharge to another link or exit from the system. The traffic regulation at an intersection is actuated by traffic lights or right-of-way rules. The inputs to the simulation are network data, trip matrix, fixed-time signal plans, gap-acceptance and car-following parameters. Outputs are in forms of animated graphics and statistical measures of network performance. The program is written in C-language. All types of vehicle attributes are represented as one entity using the structure data type which provides a flexibility in storing and modifying various types of data. Attributes of nodes, links and lanes are also represented as structures. The large number of variables associated with vehicles and the network imply that the performance of the simulation depends {{on the size of the}} network and the total number of vehicles within the network at one time. The simulator can be applied in many areas of urban traffic control and management, such as detailed evaluation of traffic signal control strategies, environmental issues such as air pollution due to emission from vehicles in <b>idling,</b> <b>accelerating,</b> decelerating or cruising, and analyses of the effects of variable demand and supply upon the performance of a network...|$|R
40|$|In {{urban and}} {{suburban}} locations, public transit {{can be seen as}} an effective mode of daily transportation. The majority of the time, travelers would seek the cheapest, shortest, and possibly most eco-friendly means of transit. When designing public transit network systems, transportation planners and decision-makers, with input from stakeholders, should strive to optimize transportation services {{to meet the needs of}} the population most efficiently and at the lowest cost, that is, providing a transportation system that s the three E 2 ̆ 7 s of the sustainability concept: environment, social equity, and economic. Previous studies have focused on sustainability as the primary concern in public transportation system design and performance; however, studies attempting to model environmental impacts in addition to costs did not account for specific characteristics of the transit vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s driving cycle (i. e., time spent cruising, <b>idling,</b> <b>accelerating,</b> and decelerating) or evaluated all the E 2 ̆ 7 s of sustainability. This dissertation explores the Pareto frontier of the three aspects of sustainability in the design of multi-modal public transportation routes with unequal space between the stops and stations with no transfers in a linear corridor by simultaneously accounting for greenhouse gas (GHG) costs, capital, operating and maintenance costs, and users 2 ̆ 7 costs. The proposed models do not account for the spatial structure of the city, but allow for a comparison of emissions and costs between various public transit trunk technologies and the use of private vehicles (i. e., conventional and hybrid) operating along the same corridor assuming static traffic conditions. The goal of this research is to support the transportation planning process by providing a systematic analysis method to evaluate the trade-offs of public transportation modes vis-a-vis the three aspects of sustainability among private vehicles. Additionally, the results of this research aim to assist transit policy-makers and practitioners when solving the multi-criteria problem of minimizing operation and passenger costs as well as the costs of GHGs in terms of CO 2 -equivalent. To achieve these objectives, analytical models are developed for user cost (a measure of social sustainability), agency cost (a measure of economic sustainability), and GHG emissions (a measure of environmental sustainability). Each of these components is monetized and combined into a single generalized cost function, which is minimized by optimizing stop spacing and service headway along the route. The findings indicate that a dedicated bus lane (DBL) is the most sustainable technology that can meet all three E 2 ̆ 7 s of sustainability up to an approximate level of demands of 200 trips per hour per mile compared to the other technologies. When the level of demand is higher than 200 trips per mile per hour, the full bus rapid transit appears to be the most sustainable mode. However, when the level of demand is within the range of 0 - 3. 99 trips per mile per hour, hybrid vehicles are competitive with a dedicated bus lane and the full bus rapid transit (Full BRT) with trade-offs among the other trunk technologies that are investigating in this dissertation. Light rail transit is found to be the most environmentally friendly among all transportation modes or technologies in this dissertation. Furthermore, a mixed traffic (MT) bus is found to be the most eco-friendly trunk transit technology compared to the tram. Both light rail and tram are competitive in terms of headways with the DBL for a certain range of demands along the route. The findings also reveal that the cost of GHG emissions is always the smallest portion of the overall cost of service with this proposed methodology for all studied trunk technologies and the variation of the GHG emissions market value does not affect the decision making when selecting the most sustainable transportation mode(s) for a city. The main takeaway of the research in terms of sustainability is that a full BRT is not always the most sustainable technology for a city, because a DBL has the potential to simultaneously meet all three E 2 ̆ 7 s of sustainability at certain level of demands. When the rails 2 ̆ 7 electricity comes from a nuclear/ offshore power-plant, metro heavy rail (MHR), tram, and light rail transit (LRT) were found to be the eco-friendliest, with MHR resulting to the highest and LRT to the lowest emissions...|$|R
