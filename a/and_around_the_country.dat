5|$|Houston pioneered American car {{culture in}} the early 1900s thanks to the ready {{availability}} of inexpensive gasoline. By the 1920s traffic congestion had become so serious that the city became {{the first in the}} nation to install interconnected traffic lights. Visitors to the city were often astonished at the lack of pedestrian access to shopping venues and the importance of the automobile within the city. Though mass transit had been successful in Houston's earlier years, later efforts aimed at promoting mass transit and urban planning were largely defeated in Houston because of opposition by the public, which favored public investment in roads over mass transit. Urban concepts pioneered in Houston, like establishing shopping centers outside the city's core and encouraging suburban sprawl, became major trends adopted in many cities, both within the state <b>and</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many {{prisons in}} the United States are overcrowded. For example, California's 33 prisons {{have a total}} {{capacity}} of 100,000, but they hold 170,000 inmates. Many prisons in California <b>and</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> are forced to turn old gymnasiums and classrooms into huge bunkhouses for inmates. They do this by placing hundreds of bunk beds next to one another, in these gyms, without any type of barriers to keep inmates separated. In California, the inadequate security engendered by this situation, coupled with insufficient staffing levels, have led to increased violence and a prison health system that causes one death a week. This situation has led the courts to order California to release 27% of the current prison population, citing the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The three-judge court considering requests by the Plata v. Schwarzenegger and Coleman v. Schwarzenegger courts found California's prisons have become criminogenic {{as a result of}} prison overcrowding.|$|E

500|$|Many {{men of the}} {{congregation}} volunteered to transport [...] the materials to New Kensington. The congregation found a contractor, Mr. Charles Camarata, to direct the free labor. Camarata had built {{hundreds of miles of}} road in the state of Pennsylvania <b>and</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> In addition, he had constructed homes, civic buildings, and churches. As soon as he agreed to take the job in December 1940, he split the volunteers into three groups. Camarata personally supervised the first group, which removed the marble from Mellon Mansion. The second group transported the marble to New Kensington and the third placed the materials on the grounds of Mt. St. Peter. This project started on December 13, 1940, and continued until May 26, 1941. The process was difficult and time consuming, made more difficult by the harsh winter of 1940–1941.|$|E
500|$|Some Manchester City {{fans were}} unhappy about signing {{a former member}} of the Luftwaffe. Season ticket holders {{threatened}} a boycott, and various groups in Manchester <b>and</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> bombarded the club with protest letters. In addition to this difficulty, Trautmann was replacing the recently retired Frank Swift, one of the greatest keepers in the club's history. Though privately expressing doubts about the signing, the club captain, Eric Westwood, a Normandy veteran, made a public display of welcoming Trautmann by announcing, [...] "There's no war in this dressing room". Trautmann made his first team debut on 19 November against Bolton Wanderers, and after a competent display in his first home match, protests shrank as fans discovered his talent. He continued to receive abuse from crowds at away matches, which affected his concentration in some early games; in December 1949, he conceded seven goals at Derby County.|$|E

[...] Nonetheless, he continued to perform stand-up in California <b>and</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> and gained recognition, with news sources saying he [...] "packs a wicked comic punch" [...] and [...] "pushes hard against the boundaries of good taste and manners." [...] In 1995, he released a CD, The Purveyor of Filth, which included his stand-up routines and what he described as [...] "prose in the form of spoken word." [...] He noted that it had [...] "been called everything from brilliant twisted ramblings to the sick scratchings of an obviously, sociopathic malcontent. Both are right." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Washington <b>and</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> in 1839, {{support for}} the war was eroding. The size of the Army had been {{increased}} because of the demands for manpower in the Florida war. Many people were beginning to think that the Seminole had earned a right to stay in Florida. The cost and time required to get all the Seminole out of Florida were looming larger. [...] Congress appropriated US$5,000 to negotiate a settlement with the Seminole people in order to end the outlay of resources. President Martin Van Buren sent the Commanding General of the Army, Alexander Macomb, to negotiate a new treaty with the Seminole. Remembering the broken treaties and promises of the past, they were slow to respond to the new overtures. Finally, Sam Jones sent his chosen successor, Chitto Tustenuggee, to meet with Macomb. On May 19, 1839, Macomb announced reaching agreement with the Seminole. They would stop fighting in exchange for [...] a reservation in southern Florida.|$|E

2500|$|The verdict angered the Asian American {{community}} in the Detroit area <b>and</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> [...] Journalist Helen Zia and lawyer Liza Chan (...) led the fight for federal charges, {{which resulted in the}} men's being accused of two counts of violating Chin's civil rights, under section 245 of title 18 of the United States Code. For these charges, it was not enough that Ebens had injured Chin, but that [...] "a substantial motivating factor for the defendant's actions was Mr. Chin's race, color, or national origin, and because Mr. Chin had been enjoying a place of entertainment which serves the public." [...] Because of possible mitigating factors that could lead to reasonable doubt, such as intoxication leading to the defendant's inability to form the specific intent, the prosecution's proving the evidence of uttered racial slurs was not self-sufficient for conviction. In addition, the defense found Racine Colwell, the witness who overheard the [...] "It's because of you motherfuckers we're out of work" [...] remark, to have received some clemency on a jail sentence for a prostitution charge, which suggested that the government might have tried to cut a deal for her testimony.|$|E
