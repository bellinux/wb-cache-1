5|$|Written by Gerry Davis, this four-part {{story was}} {{submitted}} on spec {{to the production}} office around February 1982. It concerned the Doctor arriving on Mondas at <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> when the Cybermen are being created. The rough storyline was where the Doctor and his companion “Felicity” arrive on the planet Mondas, Earth's twin orbiting {{on the opposite side}} of the Sun. While the Doctor works on a piece of TARDIS equipment, Felicity encounters the gentle Prince Sylvan. Sylvan accidentally activates the TARDIS, sending him, the Doctor and Felicity fifty years into the future. There, Sylvan's brother, Dega, is now king and has used the Doctor's device to begin turning his people into Cybermen. He has constructed a space fleet with which he intends to invade the mineral-rich Earth, and plans to kill any unconverted Mondans with cyanide gas. Felicity appeals to Dega's partly Cybernised wife, Queen Meta, and she shoots her husband dead—only to be killed by Dega's chief of staff, Krail. In the confusion, Sylvan and a band of Mondan rebels flee in the spaceships to Earth; the massive concussion of take-off knocks Mondas out of its orbit into deep space. Former script editor Davis submitted this idea circa early 1981, intending it to be a prequel to his and Kit Pedler's original Cyberman serial, The Tenth Planet (which also featured Cyberman Krail). It also borrowed elements from The Ark and The Savages, two stories which Davis had been story editor on. Producer John Nathan-Turner and script editor Antony Root were ultimately not interested in Genesis of the Cybermen. Davis wrote his storyline with only the Doctor and one female companion in mind; he called this character “Felicity” rather than writing with any particular companion in mind. This idea would be later explored in the Big Finish audio adventure Spare Parts by Marc Platt and released in July 2002. In turn Spare Parts was heavily borrowed from for the television episodes Rise of the Cybermen and The Age of Steel in 2006.|$|E

Consequential LCAs seek to identify the environmental consequences of a decision or a proposed change in a system under study (oriented to the future), which means that market and economic implications of a decision {{may have to be}} taken into account. Social LCA is under development as a different approach to life cycle thinking intended to assess social implications or potential impacts. Social LCA should be considered as an approach that is complementary to environmental LCA.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} general {{relativity}} predicts that if traversable wormholes exist, they can also alter the speed of time. They could allow time travel. This would be accomplished by accelerating {{one end of the}} wormhole to a high velocity relative to the other, and then sometime later bringing it back; relativistic time dilation would result in the accelerated wormhole mouth aging less than the stationary one as seen by an external observer, similar to what is seen in the twin paradox. However, time connects differently through the wormhole than outside it, so that synchronized clocks at each mouth will remain synchronized to someone traveling through the wormhole itself, no matter how the mouths move around. This means that anything which entered the accelerated wormhole mouth would exit the stationary one at <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> prior to its entry.|$|E

500|$|William McCance's {{early work}} {{was in a}} bold post-impressionist style. After the First World War he moved to London with his wife, fellow student Agnes Miller Parker (1895–1980), where he joined the same circles as Fergusson, vorticist Wyndham Lewis (1882–1957) and {{nationalist}} composer Francis George Scott. Under these influences his work became increasingly abstract and influenced by vorticism, {{as can be seen}} in Women on an Elevator (1925) and The Engineer and his Wife (1925). William Johnstone (1897–1981) was a cousin of F. G. Scott and met MacDiarmid as a student at Edinburgh. He studied cubism, surrealism and was introduced to new American art by his wife the sculptor Flora Macdonald. He moved towards abstraction, attempting to utilise aspects of landscape, poetry and Celtic art. His most significant work, <b>A</b> <b>Point</b> <b>in</b> <b>Time</b> (1929–38), has been described by art historian Duncan Macmillan as [...] "one of the most important Scottish pictures of the century and one of the most remarkable pictures by any British painter in the period".|$|E
500|$|William Johnstone (1897–1981) {{was one of}} {{the artists}} most closely {{associated}} with the Scottish Renaissance, an attempt to introduce modernism into art and to create a distinctive national art.

Stanley Cursiter (1887–1976) was influenced by the Celtic revival, post-impressionism and Futurism. Later in his career he became a major painter of the coastline of this native Orkney. Other artists strongly influenced by modernism included James McIntosh Patrick (1907–98) and Edward Baird (1904–49). Both trained in Glasgow, but spent most of their careers in and around their respective native cities of Dundee and Montrose. Both were influenced by surrealism and the work of Bruegel and focused on landscape, as can be seen in McIntosh Patrick's Traquair House (1938) and more overtly in Baird's The Birth of Venus (1934).|$|E
500|$|Patrick Geddes {{coined the}} phrase Scottish Renaissance, arguing that {{technological}} development needed to paralleled in the arts. This ideas were {{taken up by}} a new generation, led by the poet Hugh MacDiarmid who argued for a synergy between science and art, the introduction of modernism into art {{and the creation of}} a distinctive national art. These ideas were expressed in art in the inter-war period by figures including J. D. Fergusson, Stanley Cursiter (1887–1976), William McCance (1894–1970) and William Johnstone (1897–1981). Fergusson was one of the few British artists who could claim to have played a part in the creation of modernism. His interest in machine imagery can be seen in paintings such as Damaged Destroyer (1918). Cursiter was influenced by the Celtic revival, post-impressionism and Futurism, as can be seen in his Rain on Princess Street (1913) and Regatta (1913). McCance's early work was in a bold post-impressionist style, but after World War I it became increasingly abstract and influenced by vorticism, as can be seen in Women on an Elevator (1925) and The Engineer and his Wife (1925). Johnstone studied cubism, surrealism and new American art. He moved towards abstraction, attempting to utilise aspects of landscape, poetry and Celtic art.
