40|$|Several {{previous}} works in wireless network security {{have demonstrated the}} weakness of conventional security mechanisms. Spoofing MAC address by transmission monitoring is not <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> even <b>for</b> inexpert attackers and once a malicious device has obtained such an address the range of possible threats is wide. In this thesis a new identification algorithm is proposed. This method {{is based on the}} unique and unclonable characteristics of radio transmitters. By exploiting minimal impairments inside analog hardware components a digital fingerprint can be extracted by only looking at the received signal and a database of legal clients can be built. Unique characteristics of antenna, oscillator, amplifiers and other transmitter specific elements are indeed directly transferred on the transmitted signal providing idiosyncratic features. For testing the model we use ten reconfigurable FPGA WARP radio boards as transmitters and a common WARP radio board as receiver. Signature extraction is done by looking at received frames and as much as 14 different classifiers are deployed. These metrics include frequency offset, modulated phase offset, in-phase/quadrature offset from the origin, and magnitude. Each classifier may provide a weak contribution, but it is only after combining all of them using a weighted voting algorithm that our model is able to perfectly classify six boards over ten and provide fair results for other three radios by analyzing as few as ten received frames per board...|$|R
2500|$|Clinton {{also saw}} the {{potential}} political changes in the Mideast {{as an opportunity for}} an even more fundamental change to take place, that being the empowerment of women (something Newsweek magazine saw as Clinton's categorical imperative).

At home, Clinton was even more expansive, looking on a worldwide basis: [...] "I believe that the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the 21st century. We see women and girls across the world who are oppressed and violated and demeaned and degraded and denied so much of what they are entitled to as our fellow human beings." [...] She also maintained that the well-being of women in other countries was a direct factor in American self-interest: [...] "This is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> American values and for American foreign policy and our interests, but it is also <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> our security. Because where women are disempowered and dehumanized, you are more likely to see not just antidemocratic forces, but extremism that leads to security challenges for us." [...] She subsequently elaborated upon this theme, saying [...] "A lot of the work I do here in the State Department on women's or human-rights issues is not just because I care passionately – which I do – but because I see it as [...] to increase security to fulfill American interests. These are foreign-policy and national-security priorities for me." ...|$|E

40|$|RDF is structured, dynamic, and schemaless data, {{which enables}} <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> of {{flexibility}} <b>for</b> Linked Data {{to be available}} in an open environment such as the Web. However, for RDF data, flexibility {{turns out to be}} the source of many data quality and knowledge representation issues. Tasks such as assessing data quality in RDF require a different set of techniques and tools compared to other data models. Furthermore, since the use of existing schema, ontology and constraint languages is not mandatory, there is always room for misunderstanding the structure of the data. Neglecting this problem can represent a threat to the widespread use and adoption of RDF and Linked Data. Users should be able to learn the characteristics of RDF data in order to determine its fitness for a given use case, for example. For that purpose, in this doctoral research, we propose the use of constraints to inform users about characteristics that RDF data naturally exhibits, in cases where ontologies (or any other form of explicitly given constraints or schemata) are not present or not expressive enough. We aim to address the problems of defining and discovering classes of constraints to help users in data analysis and assessment of RDF and Linked Data quality.

40|$|There {{are many}} reasons why a {{government}} would like to tax differentially commodities known as "bads. " One is to discourage its consumption; these are goods that generate negative externalities, addiction and health problems. Another reason is that since these consumption goods have a relatively inelastic demand, taxing them heavily will bring <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> of revenue <b>for</b> the government. Finally, there is a moral element in having the consumer of these so called sinful goods to face higher prices through taxes. Cigarette and other tobacco products are categorized in this group, traditionally in the United States the cigarette tax has been applied as an excise tax. The interesting design feature of this tax {{is that it is}} a single stage tax and it is already included in the product's price at the time of purchase, making it almost invisible and in theory less politically sensitive. This paper answers two sets of questions that are equally relevant for the study of excise taxation, and in particular, of cigarette taxation. The first set is: What is the influence of the tax in consumer behavior? How do consumers respond to any increase in taxes, while controlling for all other variables such as smoking restrictions, publicity and factors like income, race, and other demographic characteristics? And the second is: what is the influence of political decisions and other types of political and social variables in the determination of cigarette taxes?These questions are answered by using a two equation model, and a data set for the USA fifty states and D. C, from 1970 to 2010. The impact of different social, economic and political variables is studied, and the results are discussed under the optic of an integrated analysis of public finance and political economics...|$|R
