Study will address the factors determining the dividend policy practiced by companies listed in the Portuguese stock market. The latter will be 47 non-financial companies listed on the Euronext Lisbon during 2009 until 2011. The two samples that have been investigated include the representative of the majority of non-financial companies listed on Euronext Lisbon and the other financial companies members of the PSI 20. The methodology adopted is one of the ordinary least squares regression and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> per share distributed was used in determining the dependent variable.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{investigates the}} {{changing}} nature <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> policy, by undertaking analyses of the company, country, and time-level determinants that affect companies’ decisions to pay, initiate, and omit <b>dividends,</b> and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> that are paid. The research contributes to existing literature by examining the combination <b>of</b> theories <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> policy, including dividend smoothing theory, agency costs theory, signaling theory, catering theory, and tax clientele theory. The analysis is undertaken using a panel data of 66, 831 company-year observations drawn from thirty-one countries, over the period 1990 to 2010. In all stages of model estimation, a baseline model that incorporates central company characteristics, and augmented models that include additional variables that proxy for alternative theories, are specified and tested. A logit regression model is employed to examine the factors that affect companies’ decisions to pay, initiate, and omit dividends. The large and profitable companies that generate excess free cash flows, and whose shareholders are tax advantaged when receiving cash dividends {{are more likely to}} initiate and pay dividends. However, the companies with more growth options and more liquid shares are less likely to initiate and pay dividends. Mixed results are found in terms of the impact <b>of</b> debt on <b>dividend</b> payment and initiation decisions. For the majority of countries, companies’ decisions to omit dividends are only affected by profitability, available investment opportunities, and size. The impact of the Global Financial Crisis on the decision to omit dividends is persistent and robust, indicating that companies are highly likely to omit dividends if they face financial difficulties. The multi-country analysis, which is drawn from twenty-two countries over the period 1991 to 2008, reveals that companies operating under civil law regimes are more likely to initiate and pay dividends. Moreover, companies in developed markets are more likely to initiate and pay dividends compared with those in emerging markets. Of note, the degree of investor protection offered and the maturity of financial markets {{play a significant role in}} mitigating the severity of agency problems. Panel data regression analysis is undertaken to examine the company, country, and time-level determinants on the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> paid. The majority <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> are typically paid by large, profitable companies with excess free cash flows. Conversely, companies with more available investment opportunities and more liquid shares tend to pay fewer dividends. Mixed results are found regarding the impact of debt levels on the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> paid. The results provide evidence that the presence of investor protection and the maturity of financial markets weaken the relationship between managerial ownership and the dividend payout ratio, suggesting that the degree of investor protection offered and the maturity of financial markets are a substitution mechanism for dividend payout in mitigating the severity of agency problems. Further, the joint impacts of the determinants on the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> paid are significantly different between developed and emerging markets. Specifically, companies in developed markets follow a smoother dividend policy and their payout ratios are less dependent on profitability relative to those in emerging markets. Additionally, for companies in emerging markets, there is a strong negative relationship between corporate debt levels and the dividend payout ratio. On the whole, the key factors in determining the decisions to pay or not to pay <b>dividends</b> and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> paid are homogeneous across countries, namely profitability, investment opportunities, company size, capital structure, liquidity, and free cash flows. Most importantly, strong evidence is found for the dividend smoothing hypothesis, the free cash flow hypothesis of agency costs theory, the tax clientele theory, and the dividend substitution theory in explaining the decisions to pay, initiate, and omit <b>dividends</b> and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> paid. However, the evidence casts doubt on dividend signaling theory and agency costs theory to the extent that they are proxied by the managerial ownership variable...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} country-level {{creditor}} rights influence dividend policies {{around the world}} by establishing {{the balance of power}} between debt and equity claimants. Creditors demand and managers consent to a more restrictive payout policy as a substitute for weak creditor rights in an effort to minimize the firm’s agency costs of debt. Using a sample of 120, 507 firm-years from 52 countries, we find that both the probability and <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> payouts are significantly lower in countries with poor creditor rights. A reduction in the creditor rights index from its highest value to its lowest value implies a 41 % reduction in the probability of paying a dividend, and a 60 % reduction in dividend payout ratios. These results are robust to numerous control variables, sample variations, model specifications, and alternative hypotheses. We also show that the agency costs of debt play a more decisive role in determining dividend policies than the previously documented agency costs of equity. Overall, our findings contribute to the growing literature arguing that creditors exert significant influence over corporate decision-making outside of bankruptcy...|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the relationship between government ownership and dividend policy of Malaysian listed companies. Specifically, {{the objective of the}} study is to examine whether government and state ownerships influence dividend payout and dividend per share. The study used a sample of 400 companies, which were randomly chosen. Two dependent variables were used as a proxy for dividend namely the dividend per share (DPS) and dividend payout ratio (DPR), while 8 government agencies (EPF, LTH, KWAP, LTAT, MKD, KNB, PNB and STATE) represented government ownership. Since dividends are truncated, the Tobit model was utilized to examine the effect of government ownership. The findings showed that there is no relationship between government ownership and dividends when using the DPS as the dependent variable. However, when DPR is used, the result showed that government ownership could affect the dividend policy. Furthermore, it is found that privately funded government agencies were more likely to affect dividends. This result indicates that these government agencies influence the proportion of earnings distribution or the payable amount rather than the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> per unit of shares...|$|E
