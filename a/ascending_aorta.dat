5|$|Primitive {{fish have}} a four-chambered heart, but the {{chambers}} are arranged sequentially {{so that this}} primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood, from the body, through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium {{and then to the}} powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the <b>ascending</b> <b>aorta,</b> while the other forms the pulmonary artery).|$|E
5|$|Small lymphatic {{networks}} called plexuses exist beneath each of {{the three}} layers of the heart. These networks collect into a main left and a main right trunk, which travel up the groove between the ventricles that exists on the heart's surface, receiving smaller vessels as they travel up. These vessels then travel into the atrioventricular groove, and receive a third vessel which drains the section of the left ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. The left vessel joins with this third vessel, and travels along the pulmonary artery and left atrium, ending in the inferior tracheobronchial node. The right vessel travels along the right atrium and the part of the right ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. It usually then travels in front of the <b>ascending</b> <b>aorta</b> and then ends in a brachiocephalic node.|$|E

40|$|Summary.

An increased number of 5 A alleles leads to high expression of MMP- 3. Thus, objective {{of the study was}} to determine whether the 5 A/ 6 A polymorphism in the promoter region of MMP- 3 gene is associated with the development of dilatative pathology of <b>ascending</b> thoracic <b>aorta.</b> We studied 76 patients (age ranged from 31 to 81 years; median age, 64 years) who underwent aortic reconstruction surgery due to dilatative pathology of <b>ascending</b> thoracic <b>aorta</b> and a random sample of the population (n= 604) aged 25 – 64 years, all from Lithuania.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} effects of amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, on development of angiotensin II (AngII) -induced vascular pathologies. Methods and Results: Male LDL receptor-/- mice were infused with vehicle, amlodipine (5 mg/kg/d), AngII (1, 000 ng/kg/min), or AngII + amlodipine for 4 weeks through osmotic pumps (n= 10 /group). Mice were fed a saturated fat-enriched diet for 1 week prior to pump implantation and during 4 weeks of infusion. Infusion of amlodipine resulted in plasma concentrations of 32 ± 2 ng/ml and 27 ± 2 ng/ml for mice in saline + amlodipine and AngII + amlodipine groups, respectively. This infusion rate of amlodipine did not affect AngII-induced increases in systolic blood pressure. Three of 10 (30 %) mice infused with AngII died of aortic rupture, while aortic rupture did not occur in mice co-infused with AngII + amlodipine. Suprarenal aortic width and intimal area of <b>ascending</b> <b>aortas</b> were measured to define aortic aneurysms. In the absence of AngII infusion, amlodipine did not change suprarenal aortic width and ascending aortic area. Infusion of AngII led to profound increases of suprarenal aortic width (saline + vehicle versus AngII + vehicle: 0. 86 ± 0. 02 versus 1. 72 ± 0. 26 mm; P= 0. 0006), whereas co-infusion of AngII and amlodipine diminished abdominal dilation (1. 02 ± 0. 14 mm; P= 0. 003). As expected, AngII infusion increased mean intimal area of <b>ascending</b> <b>aortas</b> (saline + vehicle versus AngII + vehicle: 8. 5 ± 0. 3 versus 12. 5 ± 1. 1 mm 2; P= 0. 001), while co...|$|R

40|$|A 40 -year-old {{man with}} Stanford type B {{dissection}} underwent his first endovascular repair (EVAR) in April 2004 by Talent thoracic stent graft. He had an uncomplicated recovery and maintained good blood pressure control. However, a new retrograde dissection appeared in September 2004. The new dissection involved his aortic arch and <b>ascending</b> thoracic <b>aorta</b> {{to the opening}} of the coronary arteries. To reconstruct the aortic arch, bypasses between the right common carotid artery (RCCA), left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery were performed before endovascular repair. A modified bifurcated Talent stent graft was deployed from the RCCA to the <b>ascending</b> thoracic <b>aorta</b> with a long limb in the innominate artery and a short limb in the aortic arch. A further two pieces of graft were deployed via the common femoral artery. The <b>ascending</b> thoracic <b>aorta</b> and aortic arch were reconstructed completely by the bifurcated stent graft.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Aortic {{wall stress}} {{has been shown}} to {{increase}} locally at the convex aspect of the ascending tract when axial root motion is increased, as occurs in aortic valve regurgitation. The study aim was to assess the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins involved in stress-induced vascular remodeling in the convexity and the concavity of dilated <b>ascending</b> <b>aortas</b> with aortic valve regurgitation. METHODS: Aortic wall specimens, harvested at the convexity and concavity of eight dilated <b>ascending</b> <b>aortas</b> with severe aortic valve regurgitation underwent morphometry, Western blot, RT-PCR and confocal immunohistochemistry. Five patients (group A) had congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), and three (group B) had Marfan's syndrome. Specimens from the aorta of three multi-organ donors served as controls. RESULTS: At morphometry, medial degeneration was more severe in the convexity than in the concavity, especially in group A. Western blot, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry disclosed an asymmetric pattern in the expression of some ECM proteins (laminin, tenascin, fibronectin). Fibronectin was increased in the convexity of both groups compared to controls at Western blot. Immunohistochemistry confirmed this pattern only in BAV. Higher levels of tenascin were found in the convexity in group A. The laminin content was greater in the concavity than in the convexity of both groups, but in group B the type of laminin was different, with the beta 2 chain particularly expressed, and almost absent in non-Marfan patients. Type I and type III collagens were more markedly reduced in the convexity than in the concavity in BAV. In group B, type I collagen was decreased and type III increased, but without any significant difference between the two aspects of the aorta. CONCLUSION: A tissue remodeling response to valve disease-related wall stress may underlie aortic dilatation with BAV regurgitation. Although morphometry showed similar changes in Marfan aortas, molecular investigations differentiated this condition, qualitatively, from BAV...|$|R

In this study, early postmortem MDCT shortly after death revealed this sign in the aorta in approximately 20 % of cases, and SVC or IVC was observed in 10 % of cases with a predominance of the <b>ascending</b> thoracic <b>aorta</b> and SVC. The frequency of this phenomenon would increase {{with the passage of time}} (Takahashi et al. 2013). Delayed postmortem CT within two hours after death revealed this sign in 56 % of cases (Shiotani et al. 2002 a). Postmortem MDCT that was performed prior to autopsy revealed this sign in the great vessels and cardiac chambers in all investigated cases (Jackowski et al. 2006). A cessation of circulation induces hypostasis of the blood, which occurs earlier in the great vessels with large lumens and in the heart chambers. The vascular sign may indicate that both the clotting process and thrombolysis are occurring in parallel. Thrombolysis occurs due to an increase in plasminogen activator release by the endothelium, and the serum platelets and serum proteins are functionally intact for a variable time shortly after death (Weisfeldt and Chandra 1981). Lower attenuation in the upper lumen of larger vessels, such as the <b>ascending</b> thoracic <b>aorta,</b> the descending thoracic aorta and the SVC, is thought to be the result of thrombolysis.|$|R
