5|$|During 1976, {{construction}} of a new shopping center directly across the street from Southdale occurred. The construction resulted in the Galleria Edina, <b>an</b> <b>upscale</b> shopping center; the new shopping mall increased competition with neighboring shopping centers. In 1987, Donaldson's announced the discontinuation of their chain of stores, which would shut one of the mall's original anchors. Instead, Donaldson's merged with Chicago-based department chain Carson Pirie Scott.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 1993, Saint Joseph Academy {{high school}} senior Joey Fischer was shot dead outside his home in Rancho Viejo, <b>an</b> <b>upscale</b> {{community}} north of Brownsville, Texas. Dora Cisneros, {{the mother of his}} ex-girlfriend, was responsible for orchestrating Fischer's murder after he broke up with her daughter Cristina. Fischer and Cristina had broken up the previous summer, but Cisneros became obsessed with their relationship and insisted that Fischer date her daughter again. After he refused a US$500 offer from Cisneros, she consulted María Mercedes Martínez, a fortune teller, to cast a spell on him.|$|E
5|$|The Magnificent Mile, {{sometimes}} referred to as The Mag Mile, is <b>an</b> <b>upscale</b> section of Chicago's Michigan Avenue, running from the Chicago River to Oak Street in the Near North Side. The district is located adjacent to downtown, and one block east of Rush Street. The Magnificent Mile serves as the main thoroughfare between Chicago's Loop business district and its Gold Coast.

5|$|Like the Berlina, the Calais {{retains the}} {{features}} of the outgoing model but at a lower price point. Offering a blend of luxury and sporting character, it pairs the High Output Alloytec V6 engine of the SV6 with the five-speed automatic transmission. Unlike the previous model Calais which featured a semi-sport suspension setup known as FE1.5, the VE shares the Commodore SS/SS V stiff sports suspension. Like the SS, <b>an</b> <b>upscale</b> V-Series edition is available. Being the flagship of the Commodore range, it comes with everything the VE has to offer and serves as a stepping stone to the luxury long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice range based on the VE. The Calais (as well as Berlina) are the only models in the range to feature larger tail-lights.|$|E

He was later released on bond. He returned to court on June 17, and pleaded guilty to speeding. He was ordered to pay a $531 fine, serve 18 months of probation, complete 60 hours of community service and undergo random drug tests.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 In {{this paper}} we develop <b>an</b> <b>upscaling</b> {{technique}} for non-Darcy flow in porous media. Non-Darcy model of flow applies to flow in porous media when large velocities occur. The well-posedness results for theory of quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations. To discretize the model we used lowest order Raviart-Thomas mixed finite element spaces. The resulting non-linear system is solved using fixed point iteration; we provide sufficient conditions for this iteration to converge. Then we formulate <b>an</b> <b>upscaling</b> method for non-Darcy flow extending a method by Durlofsky originally given for Darcy flow. The method computes effective coefficients {{which can be}} used to simulate the Darcy flow on a coarse grid. We compare numerical results for Darcy and non-Darcy flow and upscaling results for two scenarios; in all cases results apply to a problem with rate-specified wells...|$|R

5|$|Season three {{takes on}} a {{significantly}} greater serialized format. Rachel begins working at Bloomingdale's, <b>an</b> <b>upscale</b> department store chain, and Ross becomes jealous of her colleague, Mark. Rachel decides to take a break; and Ross, hurt and drunk, sleeps with someone else, causing Rachel to break up with him. In the meantime, Chandler {{has a hard time}} dealing with their breakup because it reminds him of his parents' divorce. After believing she has no family except her twin sister Ursula (Lisa Kudrow), Phoebe becomes acquainted with her half-brother (Giovanni Ribisi) and birth mother (Teri Garr). Joey develops a relationship with his acting partner Kate (Dina Meyer), and Monica begins a relationship with millionaire Pete Becker (Jon Favreau) which ends because of disagreements between the two.|$|E
5|$|The area east of Michigan Avenue {{and north}} of the Chicago River had a split {{personality}} {{for much of the}} 20th century - the northern portion upscale residential, retail, and university uses and the area near the Chicago River and Navy Pier dedicated to shipping and factories. At the end of the 1960s, however, residential complexes such as Lake Point Tower(1965) and McClurg Court Center (1971) began to appear among the warehouses {{and by the end of}} the century, residential and retail dominated the entire area. The neighborhood now has a reputation as part of <b>an</b> <b>upscale</b> residential strip that balances the more industrial western portion of the Near North Side.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{manufacturers}} exported {{more expensive}} {{models in the}} 1980s due to voluntary export restraints negotiated by the Japanese government and U.S. trade representatives that restricted mainstream car sales. In 1986, Honda launched its Acura marque in the U.S., influencing Toyota's plans for a luxury division. The initial Acura model was an export version of the Honda Legend, itself launched in Japan in 1985 as a rival to the Toyota Crown, Nissan Cedric/Gloria and Mazda Luce. In 1987, Nissan unveiled its plans for a premium brand, Infiniti, and revised its Nissan President sedan in standard wheelbase form for export as the Infiniti Q45, which it launched in 1990. Mazda began selling the Luce as the Mazda 929 in North America in 1988 and later began plans to develop <b>an</b> <b>upscale</b> marque to be called Amati, but its plans {{did not come to}} fruition.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>upscaled</b> lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for flow {{simulations}} in heterogeneous porous media, at both pore and Darcy scales, {{is proposed}} in this paper. In the micro-scale simulations, we model flows using LBM with the modified Guo et al. algorithm where we replace the force {{model with a}} simple Shan-Chen force model. The proposed upscaled LBM uses coarser grids to represent {{the effects of the}} fine-grid (pore-scale) simulations. For the upscaled LBM, effective properties and reduced-order models are proposed as we coarsen the grid. The effective properties are computed using solutions of local problems (e. g., by performing local LBM simulations) subject to some boundary conditions. <b>A</b> <b>upscaled</b> LBM that can reduce the computational complexity of existing LBM and transfer the information between different scales is implemented. The results of coarse-grid, reduced-order, simulations agree very well with averaged results obtained using a fine grid...|$|R

5|$|The North End Halifax {{neighbourhood}} of Richmond {{bore the}} brunt of the explosion. In 1917, Richmond was considered a working-class neighbourhood and had few paved roads. After the explosion, the Halifax Relief Commission approached the reconstruction of Richmond as an opportunity to improve and modernize the city's North End. English town planner Thomas Adams and Montreal architectural firm Ross and Macdonald were recruited to design a new housing plan for Richmond. Adams, inspired by the Victorian garden city movement, aimed to provide public access to green spaces and to create a low-rise, low-density and multifunctional urban neighbourhood. The planners designed 326 large homes that each faced a tree-lined, paved boulevard. They specified that the homes be built with a new and innovative fireproof material, blocks of compressed cement called Hydrostone. The first of these homes was occupied by March 1919. Once finished, the Hydrostone neighbourhood consisted of homes, businesses and parks, which helped create a new sense of community in the North End of Halifax. It has now become <b>an</b> <b>upscale</b> neighbourhood and shopping district. In contrast, the equally poor and underdeveloped area of Africville was not included in reconstruction efforts.|$|E
