50|$|A complex {{assessment}} {{is the one}} that requires a rubric and an expert examiner. Example items for complex assessment include thesis, funding proposal, etc. The complexity of {{assessment is}} due to the format implicitness. In the past it has been puzzling to deal with the ambiguous assessment criteria for final year project (FYP) thesis assessment. Webster, Pepper and Jenkins (2000)discussed some common general criteria for FYP thesis and their ambiguity regarding use, meaning and application. Woolf (2004)more specifically stated on the FYP <b>assessment</b> <b>criterion</b> weighting:‘The departments are as silent on the weightings that they apply to their criteria as they are on thenumber of criteria that contribute to a grade’. A more serious concern was raised by Shay (2004) who argued that the FYP assessment for engineering and social sciences is ‘a socially situatedinterpretive act’, implying that many different alternative interpretations and grades are possible for one assessment task. The problems with the FYP thesis assessment have thus received muchattention over the decades since the assessment difficulty was discussed by Black (1975).|$|E

In the literature, the susceptibility of randomization procedures to both selection and chronological bias is already well studied. However, no optimality statement is given for the selection of a randomization procedure, when both types of bias are present simultaneously. Therefore, a linked <b>assessment</b> <b>criterion</b> for the selection of an appropriate randomization procedure is presented. The linked <b>assessment</b> <b>criterion</b> is based on desirability functions. For the calculation of the optimality score of a randomization procedure the importance of the investigated types of bias is considered.

Finally, a recommendation for the choice of a randomization procedure is given in the presence of both selection and chronological bias...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the impact of giving {{students}} specific <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> in the first part of a badminton unit on the response rates of students with various skill levels. This study also investigated whether setting and stating specific <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> in the beginning of an activity unit increased student achievement and learning throughout the course of instruction. Participants of this study consisted of a purposeful sample of 12 female physical education students from an Indiana high school participating in a badminton unit. Data was collected during a 10 -day badminton unit on two more-skilled, two average-skilled, and two less-skilled students in each of two classes. One of these classes received specific <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> in the first part of the badminton unit, while the other class received the specific <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> at the end of the same badminton unit. The participants' response rates for each forehand, backhand, overhand, and serve badminton hit attempted were coded as correct successful, incorrect successful, correct unsuccessful, or incorrect unsuccessful. Participant data was graphed, including a 3 -day baseline, and compared between the control group and experimental group. Research findings revealed that participants in the experimental group, who received specific <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> in the first part of the badminton unit, had a higher quality of response rates throughout the unit than participants of similar skill level in the control group, who did not receive the specific <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> unit the end of the same unit. The results of this study suggest that student response rates increase throughout a unit when specific <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> is given at the beginning of the unit for students of more-, average-, and less-skill levels. This study concludes that physical educators may increase student achievement and learning throughout an instructional unit by setting and stating specific <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> at the beginning of an instructional unit. Increased student response rates mean greater time spent on task and improved skill development. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
40|$|Student {{portfolios}} {{are increasingly}} used for assessing student competences in higher education, but results about {{the construct validity}} of portfolio assessment are mixed. A prerequisite for construct validity is that the portfolio assessment is based on relevant portfolio content. <b>Assessment</b> <b>criteria,</b> are often used to enhance this condition. This study aims to identify whether <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> can improve content, argumentation and communication during teacher moderation while judging student portfolios. Six teachers scored 32 student portfolios in dyads with and without <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria.</b> Their judgement processes were qualitatively analysed. Results indicated that the quality of their judgement processes was low, since teachers based their judgements mainly on their own personal opinion and less on evidence found in the portfolio. Teachers barely paid attention to quality checks and easily agreed with each other. When teachers used <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria,</b> the quality of their judgements slightly improved. They based their judgements more on relevant evidence, used less personal experiences and more often checked the quality of their judgement processes.

Evaluating early responses to precision therapy is essential for “go” versus “no go” decisions for these molecularly targeted drugs and agents that arm the immune system. Many different response <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> exist for use in solid tumors and lymphomas.

The research aim is to study the attitude of Latvian music teachers to the criteria developed for assessing the level of mastering improvisation. For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was carried out, with music teachers of different schools and higher education institutions from all regions of Latvia (N= 187) participating in it. A paired comparison method was applied: the respondents were supposed to compare each <b>assessment</b> <b>criterion</b> of mastering improvisation with respect to each other <b>assessment</b> <b>criterion</b> of mastering improvisation. The SPSS software was used for the analysis of statistic data and presentation of the research results. The research outcomes show that the respondents’ opinions on the assessment criteria of mastering improvisation differ depending on their gender, work place, involvement in improvisation, concert activities, self-identification and length of service. Therefore the assessment made by different music teachers may also be different and equal attention should be paid to all assessment criteria...|$|E

Methods: Based on knowledge synthesis, {{a set of}} <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> were developed to classify interventions into the four types of public health provided by the EUHPID model: health promotion, health protection, disease prevention, and health care. Information was then collected on all current public health interventions in Varde Municipality within a 3 -month period in spring 2009. Finally, the interventions were categorised using the developed <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria.</b> Results: The knowledge synthesis process resulted {{in the development of}} a set of <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> and the 154 reported public health interventions were divided into relevant types using these criteria. 57 % of the interventions were based on a salutogenic health promotion approach, 33 % on a pathogenic disease prevention approach, 10 % on the pathogenic health protection approach, and 0 % on the pathogenic health care approach. Conclusions: The <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> based on the EUHPID model can be useful and have wider global significance for planning public health interventions, allocating appropriate funding to support public health interventions, and thereby encouraging and supporting more effective intersectoral working practice...|$|R
