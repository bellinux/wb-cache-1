40|$|Background: <b>Acute</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>syndromes</b> are a {{major cause}} of {{mortality}} and morbidity. Objectives/Methods: The objective of this evaluation is to review the clinical trials of two new drugs being developed for the treatment of <b>acute</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>syndromes.</b> The first drug is the anti-coagulant otamixaban, and the trial compared otamixaban with unfractionated heparin and eptifibatide in <b>acute</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>syndromes.</b> The second drug is the anti-platelet ticagrelor, and the trial compared ticagrelor with clopidogrel in <b>acute</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Results: In the SEPIA-ACS 1 TIMI 42 trial, the primary efficacy endpoint occurred in 6. 2 % of subjects treated with unfractionated heparin and eptifibatide, and to a significantly lesser extent with otamixaban. In the PLATO trial, the primary efficacy endpoint had occurred less in the ticagrelor group (9. 8 %) than in the clopidogrel group (11. 7 %) at 12 months. Conclusions: Two new drugs for <b>acute</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>syndromes,</b> otamixaban and ticagrelor, have recently been shown to have benefits in subjects undergoing percutaneous interventions compared to the present standard regimens for this condition...|$|R
