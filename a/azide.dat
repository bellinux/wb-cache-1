5|$|Silver fulminate, AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive {{explosive}} used in percussion caps, {{is made by}} {{reaction of}} silver metal with nitric acid {{in the presence of}} ethanol. Other dangerously explosive silver compounds are silver <b>azide,</b> AgN3, formed by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium <b>azide,</b> and silver acetylide, Ag2C2, formed when silver reacts with acetylene gas in ammonia solution. In its most characteristic reaction, silver <b>azide</b> decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the photosensitivity of silver salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} the {{impurities}} NO and HNO3 are also formed in this reaction. The impurities can be removed by passing the gas through aqueous sulfuric acid containing potassium dichromate. Very pure nitrogen can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of barium <b>azide</b> or sodium <b>azide.</b>|$|E

40|$|A very {{efficient}} method for {{the synthesis of}} β-amino­ethanesulfonyl <b>azides</b> is descibed. These aliphatic sulfonyl <b>azides</b> are accessible starting {{from a variety of}} protected amino acids, including those having functionalized side chains. Furthermore, these sulfonyl <b>azides</b> can be coupled to thio acids, and can be substituted with different aliphatic amines...|$|R
5|$|Hydrogen <b>azide</b> (HN3) {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1890 by the oxidation of aqueous hydrazine by nitrous acid. It is very explosive and even dilute solutions can be dangerous. It has a disagreeable and irritating smell {{and is a}} potentially lethal (but not cumulative) poison. It may be considered the conjugate acid of the <b>azide</b> anion, and is similarly analogous to the hydrohalic acids.|$|E
5|$|The three {{fluorides}} {{of chlorine}} form {{a subset of}} the interhalogen compounds, all of which are diamagnetic. Some cationic and anionic derivatives are known, such as , , , and Cl2F+. Some pseudohalides of chlorine are also known, such as cyanogen chloride (ClCN, linear), chlorine cyanate (ClNCO), chlorine thiocyanate (ClSCN, unlike its oxygen counterpart), and chlorine <b>azide</b> (ClN3).|$|E
5|$|Beryllium nitride, Be3N2 is a {{high-melting-point}} compound {{which is}} readily hydrolyzed. Beryllium <b>azide,</b> BeN6 is known and beryllium phosphide, Be3P2 {{has a similar}} structure to Be3N2. Basic beryllium nitrate and basic beryllium acetate have similar tetrahedral structures with four beryllium atoms coordinated to a central oxide ion. A number of beryllium borides are known, such as Be5B, Be4B, Be2B, BeB2, BeB6 and BeB12. Beryllium carbide, Be2C, is a refractory brick-red compound that reacts with water to give methane. No beryllium silicide has been identified.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{in this paper}} the action of trifluoroacetic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and aluminum chloride upon ortho-substituted aryl <b>azides</b> to form indoles, azepines and arylamines in good yields. The protonated <b>azides</b> lose nitrogen to form arylnitrenium ion intermediates which undergo intramolecular aromatic N-substitution. The acid decomposition of aryl <b>azides</b> is compared with reported thermolyses...|$|R
40|$|Syntheses of N-alpha-Fmoc-peptide <b>azides</b> {{employing}} acid chloride {{as well as}} mixed anhydride {{methods have}} been carried out. The resulting Fmoc-peptide <b>azides</b> prepared have been isolated as solids in good yield (75 - 92 %) and {{are found to be}} analytically pure. Further, long shelf life of N-alpha-Fmoc-peptide <b>azides</b> makes them useful in the extension of peptide chains...|$|R
40|$|Organic <b>azides</b> {{have been}} {{exploited}} since their discovery {{because of their}} high reactivities. Various organic reactions using <b>azides</b> have been synthetically applied in chemical biology, pharmaceuticals, medicinal, and agricultural areas. In this review, we present some recent applications and developments of organic <b>azides</b> in the total synthesis of natural products (mostly within five years), especially alkaloids. We focus not only on application examples of organic <b>azides,</b> but also show their preparation methods including recently reported procedures concerning their decomposing and reducing methods in the syntheses of bioactive molecules...|$|R
5|$|Mitochondrial genomes {{have far}} fewer genes than the {{bacteria}} {{from which they}} {{are thought to be}} descended. Although some have been lost altogether, many have been transferred to the nucleus, such as the respiratory complex II protein subunits. This is thought to be relatively common over evolutionary time. A few organisms, such as the Cryptosporidium, actually have mitochondria that lack any DNA, presumably because all their genes have been lost or transferred. In Cryptosporidium, the mitochondria have an altered ATP generation system that renders the parasite resistant to many classical mitochondrial inhibitors such as cyanide, <b>azide,</b> and atovaquone.|$|E
5|$|Some silver {{compounds}} are very explosive, {{such as the}} nitrogen compounds silver <b>azide,</b> silver amide, and silver fulminate, as well as silver acetylide, silver oxalate, and silver(II) oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and acetylene should be kept away from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as silver chlorate and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.|$|E
5|$|Many other binary {{nitrogen}} hydrides are known, but {{the most}} important are hydrazine (N2H4) and hydrogen <b>azide</b> (HN3). Although it is not a nitrogen hydride, hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well. Hydrazine is a fuming, colourless liquid that smells similarly to ammonia. Its physical properties are very similar to those of water (melting point 2.0°C, boiling point 113.5°C, density 1.00g·cm−3). Despite it being an endothermic compound, it is kinetically stable. It burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour. It is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia. It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel.|$|E
40|$|Vinyl <b>azides</b> {{are highly}} {{versatile}} synthons that {{provide access to}} numerous N-heterocycles and other functional groups. α-Substituted vinyl <b>azides</b> (azido vinylidenes) are a special class that display unique reactivity, able to react not only as <b>azides,</b> but also as radical acceptors, enamine-type nucleophiles, and even electrophiles, thus delivering {{a wide range of}} nitrogen-containing compounds and their derivatives. An impressive variety of intermediates - such as iminodiazonium ions, nitrilium ions, iminyl radicals, and metal enaminyl radicals - can be generated from vinyl <b>azides</b> and exploited in cycloadditions, C-H functionalizations, hydrolysis processes, and cascade reactions under transition metal/photoredox catalysis. In addition to presenting synthetic protocols to access vinyl <b>azides,</b> this Review offers a comprehensive coverage of the development of their multifaceted reactivity, and highlights their potential as versatile precursors for synthetic applications...|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the hazards}} {{associated}} with their use, few <b>azides</b> are used commercially although they exhibit interesting reactivity for researchers. Low molecular weight <b>azides</b> are considered especially hazardous and are avoided. In the research laboratory, <b>azides</b> are precursors to amines. They are also popular for {{their participation in the}} [...] "click reaction" [...] and in Staudinger ligation. These two reactions are generally quite reliable, lending themselves to combinatorial chemistry.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Azides</b> may {{be reduced}} to amines by hydrogenolysis or with a {{phosphine}} (e.g., triphenylphosphine) in the Staudinger reaction. This reaction allows <b>azides</b> to serve as protected -NH2 synthons, {{as illustrated by the}} synthesis of 1,1,1-tris(aminomethyl)ethane: ...|$|R
5|$|Sodium occurs {{mostly in}} {{seawater}} and dried seabed, {{but is now}} produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700°C {{through the use of}} a Downs cell. Extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium <b>azide.</b> Potassium occurs in many minerals, such as sylvite (potassium chloride). Previously, potassium was generally made from the electrolysis of potassium chloride or potassium hydroxide, found extensively in places such as Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, and Jordan, in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It can also be produced from seawater. However, these methods are problematic because the potassium metal tends to dissolve in its molten chloride and vaporises significantly at the operating temperatures, potentially forming the explosive superoxide. As a result, pure potassium metal is now produced by reducing molten potassium chloride with sodium metal at 850°C.|$|E
25|$|An {{improved}} method {{published in}} 2007 {{starts with the}} enantioselective desymmetrization of aziridine 1 with trimethylsilyl <b>azide</b> (TMSN3) and a chiral catalyst to the <b>azide</b> 2. The amide group is protected as a BOC group with Boc anhydride and DMAP in 3 and iodolactamization with iodine and potassium carbonate first gives the unstable intermediate 4 and then stable cyclic carbamate 5 after elimination of hydrogen iodide with DBU.|$|E
25|$|The above {{reaction}} is the route {{adopted by the}} commercial chemical industry to produce <b>azide</b> salts, which are used as detonators.|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{synthesis}} of acid <b>azides</b> via in situ generation of acid chlorides using CPICl as chlorinating agent from the corresponding N-alpha-protected amino acids is described. Also {{the conversion of}} acid <b>azides</b> into ureidopeptides through the Curtius rearrangement under ultrasonication is delineated. The mildness of the protocol renders the acid-sensitive substrates to afford the corresponding amino acid <b>azides</b> and ureidopeptides in good yields. Diphenylcyclopropenone has also been recovered from the reaction mixture and reused...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{synthesis}} of N-substituted isoindolinones and 3 -arylaminophthalides was developed through aza-Wittig/cyclisation. The reaction of o-phthalaldehydic acid methyl ester with benzylic, aromatic and aliphatic <b>azides</b> gave N-isoindolinones whereas reaction of o-phthalaldehydic acid with the aromatic <b>azides</b> gave 3 -arylaminophthalides...|$|R
40|$|Arynes {{formed through}} fluoride-promoted ortho-elimination of o-(trimethylsilyl) aryl triflates can undergo [3 + 2] cycloaddition with various <b>azides</b> to form {{substituted}} benzotriazoles. The rapid reaction times and mild conditions make this an attractive {{variation of the}} classical ‘click’ reaction of <b>azides</b> and alkynes. ...|$|R
25|$|Thermal {{treatment}} or photolysis of triazolines expels nitrogen, producing an aziridine. Triazolines {{can be generated}} by cycloaddition of alkenes with an <b>azide.</b>|$|E
25|$|An MFC-type BOD sensor {{can provide}} {{real-time}} BOD values. Oxygen and nitrate are preferred electron acceptors over the electrode, reducing current generation from an MFC. MFC BOD sensors underestimate BOD {{values in the}} presence of these electron acceptors. This can be avoided by inhibiting aerobic and nitrate respiration in the MFC using terminal oxidase inhibitors such as cyanide and <b>azide.</b> Such BOD sensors are commercially available.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authors have}} shown that {{endogenous}} methane is produced {{not only by the}} intestinal flora and then absorbed into the blood, but also is produced - in small amounts - by eukaryotic cells (during process of lipid peroxidation). And they have also shown that the endogenous methane production rises during an experimental mitochondrial hypoxia, for example, sodium <b>azide</b> intoxication. They thought that methane could be one of intercellular signals of hypoxia and stress.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in radical azidation using sulfonyl <b>azides</b> are presented. For instance, radical carboazidation using α-iodoketones, desulfitative carboazidation, and anti-Markovnikov hydroazidation of alkenes are described. These novel methods tolerate {{a large number}} of functional groups and allow the synthesis of organic <b>azides</b> that would be difficult to synthesize otherwise. The transformation of the <b>azides</b> using reductive processes as well as a Schmidt reaction under nonacidic conditions were used to synthesize alkaloids including indolizidine 167 B, monomorine I, cylindricine C, and lepadiformine...|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} of 3 -azido- 2, 3 -dideoxy-hexopyranose compounds from the D-gluco, D-galacto, D-lacto, and L-arabino carbohydrate series, with (diacetoxyiodo) benzene and iodine, generated 2 -azido- 1, 2 -dideoxy- 1 -iodo-alditols with one carbon {{less than the}} starting carbohydrate. These -iodo <b>azides</b> could be transformed by dehydroiodination into vinyl <b>azides,</b> which in turn afforded 3 -monosubstituted 2 H-azirines under thermal conditions. These -iodo <b>azides</b> and 2 H-azirines may be interesting chiral synthons for the preparation of more complex heterocyclic systems...|$|R
40|$|Alkyl <b>azides</b> {{have been}} found to undergo an {{unexpectedly}} facile photodecomposition under mild conditions (laboratory light) and the reaction gives rise to small amounts of aldehydes and monoacyl aminal rearrangement products that can dramatically impact on the uses of <b>azides</b> in chemistry, biology and medicine...|$|R
25|$|During the 1921–22 school year, Carothers held {{a one-year}} {{appointment}} as a chemistry {{instructor at the}} University of South Dakota. It was at the University of South Dakota that he began his independent research that resulted in an article accepted by the Journal of the American Chemical Society. In this paper he measured physical properties of phenylisocyanate and of diazobenzene-imide (now known as phenyl <b>azide).</b> The properties have very similar values, which {{led him to the}} conclusion that the structure of the second compound is C6H5-N=N=N, with the three nitrogen atoms in a linear chain rather than a ring as previously thought.|$|E
25|$|In 1910, radium was {{isolated}} as a pure metal by Marie Curie and André-Louis Debierne through the electrolysis of a pure radium chloride (RaCl2) solution using a mercury cathode, producing a radium–mercury amalgam. This amalgam was then heated {{in an atmosphere}} of hydrogen gas to remove the mercury, leaving pure radium metal. The same year, E. Eoler isolated radium by thermal decomposition of its <b>azide,</b> Ra(N3)2. Radium metal was first industrially produced {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century by Biraco, a subsidiary company of Union Minière du Haut Katanga (UMHK) in its Olen plant in Belgium.|$|E
25|$|The amide {{group is}} reprotected as BOC 6 and the <b>azide</b> group {{converted}} to the amide 7 by reductive acylation with thioacetic acid and 2,6-lutidine. Caesium carbonate accomplishes the hydrolysis of the carbamate {{group to the}} alcohol 8 which is subsequently oxidized to ketone 9 with Dess-Martin periodinane. Cyanophosphorylation with diethyl phosphorocyanidate (DEPC) modifies the ketone group to the cyanophosphate 10 {{paving the way for}} an intramolecular allylic rearrangement to unstable β-allyl phosphate 11 (toluene, sealed tube) which is hydrolyzed to alcohol 12 with ammonium chloride. This hydroxyl group has the wrong stereochemistry and is therefore inverted in a Mitsunobu reaction with p-nitrobenzoic acid followed by hydrolysis of the p-nitrobenzoate to 13.|$|E
50|$|Organic <b>azides</b> {{engage in}} useful organic reactions. The {{terminal}} nitrogen is mildly nucleophilic. <b>Azides</b> easily extrude diatomic nitrogen, a tendency that is exploited in many reactions {{such as the}} Staudinger ligation or the Curtius rearrangement or for example in the synthesis of γ-imino-β-enamino esters.|$|R
40|$|A C–H bond of electron-rich heterocycles is {{transformed}} into a C–N bond in a reaction sequence comprising the formation of heteroaryl(phenyl) iodonium <b>azides</b> and their in situ regioselective fragmentation to heteroaryl <b>azides.</b> A Cu(I) catalyst ensures complete regiocontrol in the fragmentation step and catalyzes the subsequent 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition of the formed azido heterocycles with acetylenes. The heteroaryl <b>azides</b> can also be conveniently reduced to heteroarylamines by aqueous ammonium sulfide. The overall C–H to C–N transformation is a mild and operationally simple one-pot sequential multistep process...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} {{synthesis of}} sulfonyl carbamates and sulfonyl ureas from sulfonyl <b>azides</b> employing a palladium-catalyzed carbonylation protocol has been developed. Using a two-chamber system, sulfonyl <b>azides,</b> PdCl 2, and CO gas, released ex situ from Mo(CO) 6, were assembled to generate sulfonyl isocyanates in situ, and alcohols and aryl amines were exploited as nucleophiles {{to afford a}} broad range of sulfonyl carbamates and sulfonyl ureas. A protocol for the direct formation of substituted sulfonamides from sulfonyl <b>azides</b> and amines via nucleophilic substitution was also developed...|$|R
