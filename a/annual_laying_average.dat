Determining whether this affects the frigate breeding populations is complicated by their extended <b>annual</b> <b>laying</b> seasons and the biennial breeding periodicity of individuals rearing fledgelings.

40|$|In 2012 and 2013, was {{studied the}} occurrence, biology and {{harmfulness}} of Byctiscus betulae (L.) (Rhynchitidae) on forest woody {{plants in the}} Brno region. Leaf rolls were found on 13 species (and 10 genera) of woody plants. Most frequently, they occurred on Fagus sylvatica, Tilia spp. (namely on T. cordata), Salix caprea and Populus tremula. The beetles hibernate in ground pupal chambers and appear on woody plants {{in the last decade}} of April. After hibernation, females live on average seven (males five) weeks, and damage on average 40 (males 25) cm 2 of leaves. The females create leaf rolls on annual shoots they have gnawed, exceptionally (in 2 %) on leaves with damaged petioles. In the rolls on F. sylvatica, they roll on average 5. 6 leaves whose total average area is 49. 5 cm 2 and <b>lay</b> on <b>average</b> 5. 1 eggs. In the rolls on Tilia spp., they roll on average 3. 3 leaves whose total area is 63. 2 cm 2 and <b>lay</b> on <b>average</b> 4. 9 eggs. In the rolls on S. caprea, they roll on average 3. 3 leaves whose total area is 38. 3 cm 2 and <b>lay</b> on <b>average</b> 3. 5 eggs. The maximum number of laid eggs (on average 8. 0) was observed in the leaf rolls on Vitis vinifera. The average number of eggs in the leaf rolls was decreasing from May to July. The number of eggs was increasing with the increasing total leaf area rolled. The females <b>lay</b> on <b>average</b> 50 eggs. On P. tremula, S. caprea and Pyrus pyraster they create about 15 leaf rolls, on F. sylvatica and Tilia spp. about 10 leaf rolls and on V. vinifera ca. 8 leaf rolls. Embryogenesis lasts from 8 to 9 days. Larvae develop over 3 instars and damage ca. 300 mm 2 of leaves. Coming of age within 4 − 7 weeks, they leave the leaf rolls from mid-June to the beginning of September...|$|R
40|$|Individuals {{breeding}} in seasonal environments {{are under}} strong selection to time reproduction to match offspring demand {{and the quality}} of the post-natal environment. Timing requires both the ability to accurately interpret the appropriate environmental cues, and the flexibility to respond to inter-annual variation in these cues. Determining which cues are linked to reproductive timing, what these cues are predicting and understanding the fitness consequences of variation in timing, is therefore of paramount interest to evolutionary and applied ecologists, especially in the face of global climate change. We investigated inter-annual relationships between climatic variation and the timing of reproduction in Canada’s largest breeding population of Arctic common eiders (Somateria mollissima) in East Bay, Nunavut. Warmer spring temperatures predicted both earlier mean <b>annual</b> <b>laying</b> dates and the earlier ice-free conditions required by ducklings for post-natal growth. Warmer springs had higher variation in this temperature cue, and the population laying distribution became increasingly positively-skewed in warmer summers, potentially indicating that more low-quality females had the opportunity to commence laying in warmer years. Females that timed laying to match duckling hatching just prior to fully ice-free conditions obtained the highest duckling survival probability. Inter-annual data on repeated breeding attempts revealed that the individuals examined show a similar degree of laying flexibility in response to climatic variation; however, there was significant individual variation in the absolute timing of <b>laying</b> within an <b>average</b> year. This work sheds light on how reproductive timing is related to and influenced by variation in local climate and provides vital information on how climate-related variation in reproductive timing influence a fitness measure in an Arctic species. Results are especially relevant to future work in polar environments given that global climatic changes are predicted to be most intense at high latitudes...|$|R
