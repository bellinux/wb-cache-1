5|$|The Caribbean {{initially}} provided England's {{most important}} and lucrative colonies, but not before several attempts at colonisation failed. An attempt to establish a colony in Guiana in 1604 lasted only two years, and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits. Colonies in St Lucia(1605) and Grenada(1609) also rapidly folded, but settlements were successfully established in St. Kitts(1624), Barbados(1627) and Nevis(1628). The colonies soon adopted the system of sugar plantations successfully used by the Portuguese in Brazil, which depended on slave labour, and—at first—Dutch ships, to sell the slaves <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> sugar. To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands, Parliament decreed in 1651 that only English ships {{would be able to}} ply their trade in English colonies. This led to hostilities with the United Dutch Provinces—a series of Anglo-Dutch Wars—which would eventually strengthen England's position in the Americas {{at the expense of the}} Dutch. In 1655, England annexed the island of Jamaica from the Spanish, and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|The {{unlikely}} expedition team ends {{up on the}} Destiny, an Ancient starship located {{billions of}} light-years from Earth. The ship jumps to FTL shortly after the Stargate shuts down. Rush uses an Ancient communication device to contact Stargate command, taking control of Bill Lee (Bill Dow). When he returns, Rush claims that O'Neill put him {{in charge of the}} expedition, though the others are not quick to believe him. Meanwhile, the ship, having suffered millennia of wear and tear, has a failing life support system and an inadequately sealed hull breach in one of the shuttles, which can be sealed only from inside the shuttle. Senator Armstrong learns of this and, already badly injured, sacrifices his life to seal the shuttle off <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> team time. However, the main life support is not so easily fixed. The CO2 scrubbers are decayed beyond repair, and within a day carbon dioxide poisoning will kill everyone. The Destiny, apparently aware of the problem, drops out of FTL and dials the Stargate to a desert planet with the necessary materials to repair the scrubbers. Four other locations are listed but locked out by the dialing computer. A 12-hour countdown begins, {{at the end of which}} the Destiny will continue on its journey automatically.|$|E

Mohnke's SS Division Leibstandarte, attached to the I SS Panzer Corps, was the spearhead of the operation in the Ardennes. The fuel crisis in Nazi Germany meant that the LSSAH had insufficient amounts of fuel for the vehicles. On 16 December 1944 the operation began, with Mohnke designating SS-Obersturmbannführer Joachim Peiper's Kampfgruppe to lead the push to Antwerp.|$|E

25|$|It {{is unclear}} how, but several Gulf Cartel members traced {{one of their}} stolen loads to a stash house of {{suspected}} dealers in Elsa, Texas on 1 November 2011. The cartel then called on an American-based prison gang to go <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> loads to learn {{the location of the}} stash house. The gang dealers then went and bought the drugs from the dealers, but realized that it was not at the stash house were the goods were allegedly hidden. In an attempt to disclose the information to the dealers, the gang members kidnapped them, and that was when two country sheriffs received an emergency call a possible kidnapping. The policemen then spotted the gang member's Ford F-150 pickup truck and ordered the drivers to stop. While one of the policemen was speaking to the driver, the other approached the passenger window and was shot with a 9 mm gun. The policeman managed to survive because he was wearing a bullet vest. One of the gang members, however, was killed; the other {{was shot in the head}} and remained in critical condition.|$|E
25|$|On September 22, 1920, Poland {{attacked}} Lithuanian {{units in}} the Suwałki Region on a wide front. Overwhelmed by 4–5 times larger Polish forces, some 1,700–2,000 Lithuanian troops surrendered and were taken prisoner. Polish forces then marched, as planned on September 8, across the Neman River near Druskininkai and Merkinė {{to the rear of}} the Soviet forces near Hrodna and Lida. The Red Army hastily retreated. The Lithuanians had had limited intelligence warning that such an attack might occur, but chose an inadequate defensive strategy and spread their forces too thinly along the entire Polish–Lithuanian front without sufficient forces to protect the bridges across the Neman. This attack, just two days after the resolution by the League of Nations to cease hostilities, put more pressure on Poland to settle the dispute peacefully. On September 26, the Poles captured Hrodna and the Polish foreign minister proposed new negotiations in Suwałki. The Battle of the Niemen River drastically altered the balance of power: Vilnius, in Lithuanian hands since August 26, was now exposed to a Polish attack. Indeed, the Poles had already decided to capture the city and used the negotiations in Suwałki to stall <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> time necessary to make preparations. The Lithuanian side was ready to give up the Suwałki Region in exchange for Poland's recognition of the Lithuanian claims to Vilnius.|$|E

The {{salesman}} (McCartney) offers Jackson the potion, and claims that it is [...] "guaranteed {{to give you the}} strength of a raging bull". Jackson drinks the potion and challenges a large man to arm-wrestle. Unbeknownst to a watching crowd, the man—along with Linda—is also in on the scam. After Jackson wins the rigged contest, the crowd of people surge forward <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> potion. Mac and Jack then donate all of the money earned from the scam to an orphanage. After this scene, McCartney and Jackson star as vaudeville performers who sing and dance at a bar.

Simms recommended buying the works immediately since, with ready facilities and the availability of skilled workers, they could start up in a very short time. Instead, at the first statutory meeting of the company, held while Simms was overseas, Lawson persuaded the board to buy a disused [...] four-storey cotton mill in Coventry which was owned by Lawson's associate Ernest Terah Hooley.

2500|$|A primary {{consideration}} for the game was the cost of entry to enjoy the new features of the game particularly in Pro mode; both {{the cost of the}} new keyboard and Pro guitars (ranging from $80 to 280) and the time investment to learn these aspects was considered high and may only cater to niche players. The Metro noted that if one does not purchase any of the additional hardware controllers, [...] "it's not much different to Rock Band 2". Goldstein commented that the amount of investment into the game will affect one's perception of the game's value: [...] "either something completely new and challenging or just more tracks to rock out to". Goldstein further noted that with the cost and time spent on the Pro guitar models, [...] "why not spend a little more <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> real thing". Several reviewers commented that the buttoned Mustang Pro guitar is not as sturdy as other instruments and does not have the same tactile feel as a real guitar. Specifically, the reviewers noted that the width of the button impressions do not vary in width as real guitar strings would, and there is no tactile feedback as one would have with a fretboard. These reviewers suggested that players, if dedicated to the Pro guitar mode, to wait for the stringed Fender Squier which had more favorable reviews.|$|E

I thought 'Thank you, I'll take that'!" [...] "Revolution from me bed" [...] most likely refers to Lennon's notorious bed-ins in 1969. The piano in {{the introduction of the}} song strongly resembles Lennon's [...] "Imagine", as well as [...] "Watching the Wheels". As Oasis are often criticised for borrowing parts of other artists' songs for their own, Noel Gallagher commented on the intro's similarity to [...] "Imagine" [...] saying, [...] "In the case of Don't Look Back in Anger – I mean, the opening piano riff's Imagine. 50% of it's put in there to wind people up, and the other 50% is saying 'look, this is how songs like Don't Look Back in Anger come about – because they're inspired by songs like Imagine'.
