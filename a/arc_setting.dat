Mafic metavolcanic rocks are low-K Fe-rich tholeiites and were derived by partial melting of the upper mantle sources with high Fe/Mg ratios and low M values.

Although a complete sequence of metavolcanic rocks from mafic to intermediate to felsic fractions occurs, these products were {{not the result of}} differentiation from a single magma, crustal contamination was involved in the formation of intermediate and felsic rocks.

BIFs and tuffs occupy larger area than other lithological units, which crop out as patches. Structural analysis indicates that layers of green-stone rocks are folded and display a regional fold axis {{with an attitude}} of 320 o/ 40 o. Low-grade metamorphic mineral assemblages (actinolite-epidote-chlorite in basalts and muscovite-epidote-chlorite in granitoids) are common in these rocks; this indicates a regional metamorphism at greenschist facies. However, BIFs and basalts are locally metamorphosed to epidote-amphibolite and amphibolite facies. Basalts belong to the tholeiite series whereas granites, diorites and rhyolites belong to the calcalkaline series. Chondrite normalized rare earth element pattern of basalt is flat and plot slightly below the average N-MORB values suggesting the enrichment of the light rare earth elements, which means that mantle magma source was an E-MORB. Granitoids and rhyolites have strong affinities to the continental arc source magma displaying strong enrichments in the LREEs with (La/Sm) N values ranging between 2. 53 and 3. 95 in rhyolites and between 4. 08 and 5. 40 in granitoids.

40|$|The Nehbandan {{ophiolite}} complex (NOC) crops {{out in the}} Sistan suture zone, which marks {{the boundary between the}} Lut and Afghan continental blocks. The NOC is composed of various ophiolitic lithotypes included in a tectono-sedimentary mélange, which are commonly interpreted as remnants of the oceanic lithosphere of the Sistan Ocean. Three different sequences (or associations) of ophiolitic rocks can be recognized in the NOC: (1) mantle peridotites consisting of clinopyroxene- (cpx-) rich harzburgites and depleted harzburgites; (2) olivine websterite–pyroxenite–gabbronorite sequence; (3) wehrlite–troctolite–cumulate gabbro–isotropic gabbro–basalt sequence. Petrographic observations, mineral chemistry, whole- rock chemistry, and rare earth element (REE) modelling carried out on the different rock associations led to the following conclusions: (1) the wehrlite–troctolite–cumulate gabbro–isotropic gabbro–basalt association represents a portion of oceanic crust generated in a mid-ocean ridge setting; (2) the cpx-rich harzburgites represent the residual mantle after 5 – 20 % removal of mid-ocean ridge basalt-type (MORB) melt. This residual mantle was subsequently enriched in light REE (LREE) by subduction-derived ﬂuids in a supra-subduction zone (SSZ) setting and it compositionally represents the typical mantle source for boninitic melts; (3) the olivine websterite–pyroxenite–gabbronorite association represents a portion of oceanic crust generated in an intra-oceanic arc setting; (4) the depleted harzburgites represent the residual mantle after 10 – 30 % removal of boninitic melts in an intra-oceanic <b>arc</b> <b>setting.</b> The data presented in this paper provide new constraints for the tectonic evolution of the Iranian sector of the Neo-Tethys. In fact, in contrast with previous geodynamic models, the occurrence of SSZ ophiolites in the NOC implies that the phase of convergence between the Lut and Afghan blocks, which led to the closure of the Sistan Ocean, was accompanied by the development of an intra-oceanic <b>arc</b> <b>setting...</b>|$|E

40|$|Field {{evidence}} from exposed plutonic rocks indicates that mafic-felsic magma interaction {{is an important}} process during the construction and evolution of magma chambers. The exhumed, ~ 140 Ma, Halfmoon Pluton of Stewart Island, New Zealand {{is characterized by a}} sequence of mingled mafic sheets and enclaves preserved within an intermediate-felsic host, and provides a unique opportunity to directly investigate the physico-chemical processes that operate within an <b>arc</b> <b>setting.</b> Interpretation of mingling structures and textures in the field, in combination with extensive petrographic, geochemical and geochronological data, allow for conclusions to be reached regarding the nature of the mafic-felsic magma interactions, and the physical, chemical and thermal processes responsible for the generation and evolution of the calc-alkaline magmas. Detailed documentation and interpretation of mafic-felsic magma mingling structures and textures reveal that the Halfmoon Pluton formed incrementally as the result of episodic replenishments of mafic magma emplaced onto the floor of an aggrading intermediate-felsic magma chamber. Physico-chemical processes identified include fractional crystallization and accumulation of a plagioclase – hornblende – apatite – zircon mineral assemblage, episodic replenishment by hot, wet basaltic magmas, magmatic flow and compaction. Early amphibole and apatite crystallization {{played an important role in}} the compositional diversity within the Halfmoon Pluton. Variations in the style of magma mingling preserved within the magmatic “stratigraphy” indicate that processes operating within the chamber varied in space and time. Variations in mineral zoning and composition within hornblende indicate that the Halfmoon Pluton crystallized within a magma in which melt composition fluctuated in response to repeated mafic magma replenishments, fractionation, crystal settling and convection. Mineral assemblages, chemical characteristics, isotopic data and geochronological evidence indicate that the amphibole-rich calc-alkaline Halfmoon Pluton was emplaced into a juvenile <b>arc</b> <b>setting,</b> most probably an island-arc.

40|$|The western Jurassic belt of the Klamath Mountains {{represents}} one of the Earth's best-preserved exposures of ancient marginal ocean basin lithosphere and chiefly consists of the coeval Rogue–Chetco volcanic-plutonic oceanic arc and Josephine ophiolite. This Late Jurassic ocean basin is hypothesized to have formed in response to rifting that initiated at ca. 165 Ma along the western margin of North America, disrupting a Middle Jurassic arc that had been constructed on older Klamath terranes and forming a marginal ocean basin with an active arc, inter-arc basin, and remnant arc. Previous workers characterized a “rift-edge” facies in the remnant-arc region. This chapter describes field, age, and geochemical data that suggest that a similar rift-edge facies exists {{in the vicinity of the}} active arc, on the opposite side of the marginal basin. The rift-edge facies in the active <b>arc</b> <b>setting</b> consists of two main lithotectonic units, herein named informally as the Onion Camp complex and Fiddler Mountain olistostrome. The Onion Camp complex is partly composed of a characteristic metabasalt and red chert association. Red chert yielded scarce radiolarians of Triassic(?) and Early Jurassic age. A distinct chert-pebble conglomerate occurs at scarce localities within metasedimentary rocks. Concordant, composite bodies of amphibolite and serpentinized peridotite represent another distinctive feature of the Onion Camp complex. The metamorphic and lithologic features of the Onion Camp complex are similar to the lower mélange unit of the Rattlesnake Creek terrane, and the units are interpreted to be correlative. The Fiddler Mountain olistostrome is composed of Late Jurassic (Kimmeridgian?) pelagic and hemipelagic rocks interlayered with ophiolite-clast breccia and megabreccia, similar in character to olistostromal deposits associated with the rift-edge facies of the remnant arc. The occurrence of the Rattlesnake Creek terrane and an associated olistostromal deposit within the western Jurassic belt of southwestern Oregon may therefore represent the rift-edge facies in the active <b>arc</b> <b>setting,</b> at the transition between the Rogue–Chetco arc and Josephine ophiolite, further corroborating previous models for the Late Jurassic tectonic evolution of the Klamath Mountains...|$|E

The Archean Superior Province has linear metavolcanic and metasediment-dominated subprovinces of similar scale to cenozoic island arc-trench systems of the western Pacific, suggesting an origin by accreting arcs. Models of the evolution of metavolcanic belts in parts of the Superior Province suggest an <b>arc</b> <b>setting</b> but the tectonic environment and evolution of the intervening metasedimentary belts are poorly understood.
