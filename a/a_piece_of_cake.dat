He would lock the Palace doors himself, unroll the cigars his sister made to ensure {{there was no}} poison, prepare his own yerba mate, and sleep with a pistol under his pillow. Even so, a maid tried to poison him with <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>cake.</b> No one could come within six paces of him, or even bear a cane near him. Whenever he would go out riding, he had all bushes and trees along the route uprooted so that assassins could not hide; all shutters had to be closed, and pedestrians had to prostrate before him as he passed.|$|E

2500|$|St. Thomas Aquinas, {{the leading}} {{scholastic}} theologian of the Roman Catholic Church, argued {{charging of interest}} is wrong because it amounts to [...] "double charging", charging for both the thing {{and the use of}} the thing. Aquinas said this would be morally wrong in the same way as if one sold a bottle of wine, charged for the bottle of wine, and then charged for the person using the wine to actually drink it. Similarly, one cannot charge for <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>cake</b> and for the eating of the piece of cake. Yet this, said Aquinas, is what usury does. Money is a medium of exchange, and is used up when it is spent. To charge for the money and for its use (by spending) is therefore to charge for the money twice. It is also to sell time since the usurer charges, in effect, for the time that the money is in the hands of the borrower. Time, however, is not a commodity that anyone can charge. [...] In condemning usury Aquinas was much influenced by the recently rediscovered philosophical writings of Aristotle and his desire to assimilate Greek philosophy with Christian theology. Aquinas argued that in the case of usury, as in other aspects of Christian revelation, Christian doctrine is reinforced by Aristotelian natural law rationalism. [...] Aristotle's argument is that interest is unnatural, since money, as a sterile element, cannot naturally reproduce itself. [...] Thus, usury conflicts with natural law just as it offends Christian revelation: see Thought of Thomas Aquinas.|$|E
