5|$|In 1882, Crease {{presided over}} the trial of John Hall, who owned {{most of the land}} on Burrard Inlet that now makes up the {{community}} of Belcarra, British Columbia, and who was accused of murdering his mother in law. Hall <b>and</b> <b>Crease</b> had known each other for years, <b>and</b> <b>Crease</b> had once employed him as his agent in a dispute with trespassers who illegally logged on land he and his friend Robert Burnaby owned near Hall's ranch. Hall was found guilty of manslaughter, and his land signed over to his attorney to pay for his defence.|$|E
5|$|Politically, Crease {{presented}} {{himself as a}} foe of the Hudson's Bay Company's hegemony over the colony, and in 1860 {{was elected to the}} Vancouver Island House of Assembly as an independent member representing Victoria. However, he was soon criticised by the British Colonist (a paper run by opposition leader Amor de Cosmos) for being too cozy with the HBC-backed government. The following year, as if to prove de Cosmos right, governor Sir James Douglas appointed Crease Attorney-General of British Columbia, <b>and</b> <b>Crease</b> resigned his seat in the Assembly. He was a key member of the government, responsible for pushing literally hundreds of laws through the legislature, in between his continuing circuit tours, most of which was concerned with regulating the resource-based economic activity of the colony, including land settlement and gold mining. His legislation cemented his reputation as an advocate of free trade.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with the}} other versions, it {{displays}} a suppressed storytelling of peasant men in loose-fitting garments with natural poses focused entirely on their game. Writer Nicholas Wadley described a [...] "tension in opposites", in which elements such as shifts of color, light and shadow, shape of hat, <b>and</b> <b>crease</b> of cloth create a story of confrontation through opposition. Others have described an [...] "alienation" [...] displayed in the series to be most pronounced in this version.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2010, Frenzal Rhomb {{embarked}} on the No Sleep Til Festival which featured punk and metal bands: Megadeth, Descendents, NOFX, Gwar and Dropkick Murphys. Frenzal Rhomb played {{a new song}} entitled [...] "Bird Attack". In Brisbane, on the last stop of the tour, Whalley <b>and</b> <b>Crease</b> joined Descendents on-stage with other bands' singers – Al Barr (Dropkick Murphys), Fat Mike (NOFX), Matt Skiba and Derek Grant (Alkaline Trio), and Jason Allen (Descendents' road manager) – to perform [...] "Everything Sux".|$|E
2500|$|Animal Logic and Method Studios {{also worked}} on the various parts of Ego's planet, with Animal Logic {{focusing}} on Ego's cathedral, and Method on the arrival sequence and Baby Groot's [...] "not that button" [...] sequence in the Planet Hollow. Animal Logic's work for Ego's cathedral was also based on fractal art. The team at Animal Logic were initially brought on to the film {{to work on the}} story vignettes that were used to explain the backstory, which started as oil paintings before evolving to falling sand, and eventually the final plastic sculptures that were used. Method also created the film's final sequence for Yondu's funeral. To make Rocket shedding a tear convincing, Method used in-house footage of Animation Supervisor Keith Roberts [...] "performing the scene for reference, studying the macro facial movements like minor eye darts or blinks, in addition to what was filmed on set and in the sound booth by" [...] Cooper. Additional work included the scenes on the planet Berhart. Lola VFX worked on de-aging Russell, having previously done similar work in other MCU films; they also added to various characters, including Nebula. To achieve the younger Ego, Lola referenced Russell's performance in Used Cars, as [...] "he had a lot of the [...] action" [...] the visual effects artists were looking for. They also used a younger stand in, Aaron Schwartz, since he had [...] "big broad jaw, chin, and most importantly the way the laugh lines move <b>and</b> <b>crease</b> as he talk", similar to Russell's. Laura Haddock, reprising her role from the first film of Meredith Quill in the sequence, was also slightly de-aged to play the younger version of that character. Luma {{worked on the}} Sovereign people and their world, and Adam Warlock's cocoon.|$|E

It was then 10 A.M. The word {{was given to}} load the camels, and we soon moved forward. I found my worthy protector exceedingly good-natured and civil, dragging on my asses and leading my mules. Near the Howash we passed several villages, in which I could not but remark the great proportion of children. At about 3 P.M. we forded the river, which was waist-deep, and {{on the banks of}} which were at least 3000 head of horned cattle. Seeing no signs of the expected enemy, we journeyed on till 5 P.M., when we halted at the south-eastern extremity of the Howash Plain, about one mile to the eastward of a small pool of water.|$|E
60|$|An {{observer}} standing, at this time, at {{the corner}} of Paradise avenue and Great White Throne walk in Sorrel Hill cemetery would have seen a human figure moving among the graves toward the Superintendent's residence. Dimly and fitfully visible in the intervals of thinner gloom, this figure had a most uncanny and disquieting aspect. A long black cloak shrouded it from neck to heel. Upon its head was a slouch hat, pulled down across the forehead and almost concealing the face, which was further hidden by a half-mask, only the beard being occasionally visible as the head was lifted partly above the collar of the cloak. The man wore upon his feet jack-boots whose wide, funnel-shaped legs had settled down in many a fold <b>and</b> <b>crease</b> about his ankles, as could be seen whenever accident parted the bottom of the cloak. His arms were concealed, but sometimes he stretched out the right to steady himself by a headstone as he crept stealthily but blindly over the uneven ground. At such times a close scrutiny of the hand would have disclosed in the palm the hilt of a poniard, the blade of which lay along the wrist, hidden in the sleeve. In short, the man's garb, his movements, the hour--everything proclaimed him a reporter.|$|E
60|$|On {{occasion}} he accompanied Dede and Daylight on deer hunts {{through the}} wild canons {{and over the}} rugged steeps of Hood Mountain, though more often Dede and Daylight were out alone. This riding {{was one of their}} chief joys. Every wrinkle <b>and</b> <b>crease</b> in the hills they explored, and they came to know every secret spring and hidden dell in the whole surrounding wall of the valley. They learned all the trails and cow-paths; but nothing delighted them more than to essay the roughest and most impossible rides, where they were glad to crouch and crawl along the narrowest deer-runs, Bob and Mab struggling and forcing their way along behind. Back from their rides they brought the seeds and bulbs of wild flowers to plant in favoring nooks on the ranch. Along the foot trail which led {{down the side of the}} big canon to the intake of the water-pipe, they established their fernery. It was not a formal affair, and the ferns were left to themselves. Dede and Daylight merely introduced new ones from time to time, changing them from one wild habitat to another. It was the same with the wild lilac, which Daylight had sent to him from Mendocino County. It became part of the wildness of the ranch, and, after being helped for a season, was left to its own devices they used to gather the seeds of the California poppy and scatter them over their own acres, so that the orange-colored blossoms spangled the fields of mountain hay and prospered in flaming drifts in the fence corners and along the edges of the clearings.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of {{cardboard}} cartons, an automated cutting-and-creasing table is useful. Typically, computer-aided design (CAD) software is used to define the cuts <b>and</b> <b>creases</b> based on the proof geometry, and this is fed into the cutting-and-creasing table software.|$|R
50|$|The thangka is {{devised to}} be {{conveniently}} rolled for transportation {{and this is}} a source of physical and mechanical damage. Rolling compresses and abrades the surface and abrasion is aggravated when the cover is missing. It is not an easy task to roll it with all its different components and more so if it is distorted. Moreover, the various components of the thangka rarely have the same composition or thickness. Consequently, when it is rolled, the pressure is unequal on all the parts which results in the occurrence of folds <b>and</b> <b>creases.</b> These folds <b>and</b> <b>creases</b> are destructive because they form areas of weakness. Large thangkas are at higher risk of such damage.|$|R

50|$|The {{campaign}} hat is occasionally {{referred to}} as a Stetson, derived from its origin in the company's Boss of the Plains model in the late 19th century.

50|$|A bone folder, bonefolder, or folding bone is a dull-edged {{hand tool}} used to fold <b>and</b> <b>crease</b> {{material}} in crafts such as bookbinding, cardmaking, origami, and other paper crafts {{that require a}} sharp crease or fold.
