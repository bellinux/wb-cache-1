5|$|Cnidarians feed {{in several}} ways: predation, <b>absorbing</b> {{dissolved}} organic chemicals, filtering food particles {{out of the}} water, obtaining nutrients from symbiotic algae within their cells, and parasitism. Most obtain {{the majority of their}} food from predation but some, including the corals Hetroxenia and Leptogorgia, depend almost completely on their endosymbionts and on <b>absorbing</b> dissolved nutrients. Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae carbon dioxide, some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.|$|E
5|$|A mutant {{girl who}} can absorb any person's {{memories}} and abilities by touching them. As she cannot control this <b>absorbing</b> ability, Rogue can easily kill anyone {{and thus is}} unable {{to be close to}} people. Her love interest is Iceman.|$|E
5|$|A mutant seventeen-year-old girl {{forced to}} leave her home in Mississippi when she puts her boyfriend into a coma by kissing him. Her powers include <b>absorbing</b> anyone's memories, life force, {{and in the case}} of mutants - powers through {{physical}} touch.|$|E

50|$|The label {{developed}} a larger profile in 2013 when it <b>absorbed</b> EMI Classics with that label's output <b>absorbed</b> into the Warner Classics label and the co-owned Virgin Classics <b>absorbed</b> into Erato.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Absorb</b> - This ability has a number, such as <b>Absorb</b> 2. A {{creature}} with <b>absorb</b> has the listed number of damage prevented {{if it would}} take damage from a given source.|$|R
5|$|Banksia serrata has {{a central}} taproot and few lateral roots. Clusters of fine {{branched}} proteoid roots up to 15cm (6in) long arise from larger roots. These roots are particularly efficient at <b>absorbing</b> nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, {{such as the}} phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E
5|$|C. The Football League {{expanded}} to two divisions in 1892, <b>absorbing</b> {{most of the}} teams from the Football Alliance. The league previously known simply as the Football League became the Football League First Division.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium zinc {{telluride}} (CZT) is a semiconductive alloy {{that can}} be divided into an array of small sensing devices. These devices are similar to an integrated circuit and can detect the energy of incoming gamma ray photons. When behind an <b>absorbing</b> mask, the CZT sensor array can determine the direction of the rays.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Absorbed</b> readily if {{administered}} sublingually, asenapine {{is poorly}} <b>absorbed</b> when swallowed.|$|R
2500|$|In most cases, the emitted {{light has}} a longer wavelength, and {{therefore}} lower energy, than the <b>absorbed</b> radiation; {{this phenomenon is}} known as the Stokes shift. However, when the <b>absorbed</b> electromagnetic radiation is intense, it is possible for one electron to <b>absorb</b> two photons; this two-photon absorption can lead to emission of radiation having a shorter wavelength than the <b>absorbed</b> radiation. The emitted radiation may also be of the same wavelength as the <b>absorbed</b> radiation, termed [...] "resonance fluorescence".|$|R
50|$|Shields {{include the}} {{inexpensive}} <b>Absorb,</b> which <b>absorbs</b> damage, the Magnetic shield which deflects incoming warheads, and the X-tinguisher which <b>absorbs</b> weapons {{that make a}} direct hit and puts them into the target's own inventory.|$|R
5|$|Chains of Promathia {{revolves}} around an Elvaan girl named Prishe {{and the dead}} Twilight God Promathia, who had originally cursed the Zilart race, and the attempts of various factions to either complete or stop his resurrection. The wyrmking Bahamut is involved in these events, and intends to destroy Vana'diel to prevent Promathia from <b>absorbing</b> {{the life of the}} world.|$|E

5|$|In {{fact the}} place of Sir John A. Macdonald in this country was so large and so <b>absorbing</b> that it is almost {{impossible}} to conceive that the politics of this country, the fate of this country, will continue without him. His loss overwhelms us.|$|E
50|$|Different {{molecules}} <b>absorb</b> different {{wavelengths of}} radiation. For example, O2 and O3 <b>absorb</b> almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 nanometers. Water (H2O) <b>absorbs</b> many wavelengths above 700 nm. When a molecule <b>absorbs</b> a photon, {{it increases the}} energy of the molecule. This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.|$|R

5|$|Lead {{exposure}} {{is a global}} issue since lead mining and smelting, and battery manufacturing/disposal/recycling, are common in many countries. Lead enters the body via inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Almost all inhaled lead is absorbed into the body; for ingestion, the rate is 20â€“70%, with children <b>absorbing</b> a higher percentage than adults.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.telmatiaea has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These roots are particularly efficient at <b>absorbing</b> nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, the sticky, {{modified}} bracts of Passiflora foetida {{have been}} investigated for their carnivorous ability. A 1995 paper published in the Journal of Biosciences detailed {{the evidence that the}} glandular bracts played a distinct role in defense of the flower and were also capable of digesting captured prey and <b>absorbing</b> the nutrients.|$|E

5|$|Michael Tolkin and David Hayter rewrote {{the script}} afterwards, despite {{positive}} {{response from the}} producers over France's script. Tolkin was brought in January 2000, while Hayter was brought in September of that year. Hayter's draft featured The Leader, Zzzax, and the <b>Absorbing</b> Man as the villains, who are depicted as colleagues of Banner and {{get caught in the}} same accident that creates the Hulk. Director Ang Lee and his producing partner James Schamus became involved with the film in January 20, 2001. Lee was dissatisfied with Hayter's script, and commissioned Schamus for a rewrite, merging Banner's father with the <b>Absorbing</b> Man. Lee cited influences from King Kong, Frankenstein, Jekyll and Hyde, Beauty and the Beast, Faust, and Greek mythology for his interpretation of the story. Schamus said he had found the storyline that introduced Brian Banner, thus allowing Lee to write a drama that again explored father-son themes.|$|E
5|$|Most Proteaceae and all Banksia species, {{including}} B.scabrella, have proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters of}} short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These roots are particularly efficient at <b>absorbing</b> nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. B.scabrella is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} drafts between 1947 and 1949 were {{held by the}} Basketball Association of America (BAA). The Basketball Association of America became the National Basketball Association after <b>absorbing</b> teams from the National Basketball League {{in the fall of}} 1949. Official NBA {{publications}} include the BAA Drafts as part of the NBA's draft history.|$|E

30|$|Conclusively, the {{cellular}} response to ionizing radiation {{is complex and}} differs with <b>absorbed</b> dose. The response acquired at high <b>absorbed</b> doses cannot be extrapolated down to low <b>absorbed</b> doses or vice versa. We also demonstrated that the thyroid - already at <b>absorbed</b> doses similar to those obtained in radionuclide therapy - responds with expression of {{a high number of}} genes. Due to the increased heterogeneous irradiation at low <b>absorbed</b> doses, we suggest that this response partly originates from non-irradiated cells in the tissue, i.e., bystander cells.|$|R
50|$|Cestodes have no {{digestive}} tract, and instead, they <b>absorb</b> nutrients {{along their}} tegument, which contains microvilli and glycocalyxes. The microvilli {{are used to}} <b>absorb</b> nutrients. The glycocalyx is a fuzzy coat that <b>absorbs</b> host enzymes and inhibits host proteases.|$|R
5|$|The British did {{not want}} their colony to become an American possession, and the Canadian government, despite being {{convinced}} that <b>absorbing</b> Newfoundland would not benefit Canada economically, thought that the annexation would be {{the lesser of two}} evils when compared to the prospect of the country being almost completely surrounded by American territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{absorption}} band of simple cations shift toward shorter wavelength {{when they are}} involved in more covalent interactions. This occurs during hydration of metal ions, so colourless anhydrous ionic compounds with an anion <b>absorbing</b> in the infrared can become colourful in solution.|$|E
5|$|The {{media of}} these devices were {{crystals}} with transition metal ion impurities, <b>absorbing</b> low-energy light and re-emitting it in the visible range. By the 1970s, atomic vapors were used in atomic vapor quantum counters for detection of infrared electromagnetic radiation, as they {{were found to be}} superior to the metallic salts and crystals that had been used.|$|E
25|$|The colon {{is divided}} into three {{sections}} and take part in solute absorption. The upper colon largely <b>absorbs</b> Na+ and SCFA, and partially <b>absorbs</b> KCl. The middle colon <b>absorbs</b> Na+, SCFA, with little net transfer of K+ and Cl-. The lower colon then slightly <b>absorbs</b> Na+ and water, and secretes K+. There is no net movements of Cl- and SCFA found in the lower colon.|$|R
30|$|In {{the first}} {{trimester}} of pregnancy, the <b>absorbed</b> dose to the uterus {{may be used as}} a substitute for the <b>absorbed</b> dose to the embryo. Similarly, the <b>absorbed</b> dose to the fetus from radioactive substances without placental transfer is expected to be within the same range as the dose to the uterus. In the case of radioactive substances with placental transfer, the <b>absorbed</b> dose to organs and tissues of the mother may, as a first approximation, be taken as representative of the <b>absorbed</b> dose to the corresponding organs and tissues of the fetus [51].|$|R
30|$|Following the {{recommendations}} of Publication 103 of the ICRP [14], these <b>absorbed</b> doses were then sex-averaged and the effective dose was evaluated using the tissue weighting factors of Publication 60 of the ICRP [15]. Recommendations of the ICRP subsequent to this publication were followed in the effective dose evaluation: the <b>absorbed</b> dose to the thymus gland {{was used as a}} surrogate for that to the oesophagus; the <b>absorbed</b> dose to the colon wall was calculated as the mass-weighted sum of the <b>absorbed</b> doses to the walls of the upper and lower large intestines; and the gonadal <b>absorbed</b> dose was taken to be the mean of the <b>absorbed</b> doses to the testes and ovaries [16].|$|R
