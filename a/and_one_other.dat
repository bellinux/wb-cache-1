Within twenty minutes the contact was over and the Australians proceeded to collect the discarded Indonesian weapons and equipment, including a Browning Automatic Rifle, three MI rifles and 200 rounds of ammunition. Dressed in US steel helmets, green shirts and blue and khaki shorts, the Indonesian soldiers were subsequently identified as members of 440 Battalion.|$|E
5|$|New York City actress Ash ("Liz") Sroka voices Tali {{throughout}} the Mass Effect trilogy, her first {{role in a}} video game. Sroka auditioned for three different roles: the female Commander Shepard, Tali'Zorah, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> female character. After initially receiving the role of Tali, she was still unsure of how much material there was. Ginny McSwain gave voice direction, and would generally take two takes—the first to use, the second as back-up, and occasionally a third or more if the recording did not fit with what she wanted. Recording sessions would generally last about four hours. Sroka herself is not a gamer, though she says she enjoys the character of Tali and is happy to have landed the role.|$|E

40|$|This thesis uses {{different}} {{research methods}} and sources to investigate Antony Gormley's participatory artwork <b>One</b> <b>and</b> <b>Other,</b> 2009. It {{starts with a}} discussion of participatory art practice, which provides a backdrop to the main thesis topic. Gormley's <b>One</b> <b>and</b> <b>Other</b> is introduced as aspiring to enact a form of direct democracy. However it is noted that aspects of Gormleyâs artwork limited rather than extended a form of direct democracy. A considered description of <b>One</b> <b>and</b> <b>Other</b> is progressed, the result of which is a reconsideration of <b>One</b> <b>and</b> <b>Other</b> as a complex artwork with plurality at its centre. The concept of civil society is introduced. Its structuring around private and public realms, as well as its end goals of individual autonomy and voluntary association, make it the ideal context within which to comprehend <b>One</b> <b>and</b> <b>Other.</b> This points the way to a reappraisal of <b>One</b> <b>and</b> <b>Other</b> and its place within participatory art. In conclusion the thesis asks for <b>One</b> <b>and</b> <b>Other</b> to be reconsidered. Despite its manifest defects, <b>One</b> <b>and</b> <b>Other</b> was a genuinely interesting artwork in which competing forces and different identities productively developed, together. Even though it seemed an unlikely candidate, <b>One</b> <b>and</b> <b>Other</b> has a lot to offer participatory art and those who wish to use this field of art to develop democratic agendas. Ultimately it is the mixed nature of <b>One</b> <b>and</b> <b>Other,</b> framed through the multi-faceted nature of civil society, that produces the artwork's democratic effect and not the aspiration to realise an archaic form of direct democracy. Paradoxically <b>One</b> <b>and</b> <b>Other</b> did achieve its desire to enable men and women to 'self-realise' and 'self-represent', but the path to this goal was contradictory and imperfect. </p...|$|R

5|$|Sullivan {{tended to}} re-use his ballet music. Of the five {{movements}} that Tillett and Spencer identified, only one (the Waltz, No. 3) {{is not known}} to have been used in any other work. Three of the movements had previously been used in L'Île Enchantée. Two of those, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>other,</b> were eventually re-used in Victoria and Merrie England. One was also used in his incidental music to Macbeth. Sullivan was asked in 1889 to supply a ballet for a French-language production of The Mikado in Brussels, which he duly did. Tillett suggests that the Thespis ballet was almost certainly the music that Sullivan provided, given that it was the only ballet that he wrote for use in an opera, and that three weeks after producing The Gondoliers he is unlikely to have written something original.|$|E
5|$|The Fat Duck {{is located}} in a 16th-century cottage that was further {{modified}} in the 19th and 20th centuries. Prior to the restaurant opening in the location, it was a public house called The Ringers. The building was Grade II listed by English Heritage on 2 May 1989. When the restaurant opened in 1995, the kitchen was staffed by owner Heston Blumenthal <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> employee. At the time the restaurant was serving meals in the style of a French bistro, such as lemon tarts, and steak and chips. Blumenthal later said that science had already begun to influence the cooking at this early stage, as already on the menu were his Triple Cooked Chips, which were developed to stop the potato from going soft.|$|E

5|$|The main shock hit Bucharest between {{noon and}} 1 p.m. The {{earthquake}} was felt for about 10minutes {{and was so}} violent that all chimneys in the city collapsed. Numerous historical monuments were destroyed, including St. Nicholas Church, Cotroceni Monastery and the 54-meter-high Colțea Tower. The Greek chronicler Dionysius Fotino reported that Prince Constantine Ypsilantis moved {{with his family to}} the Văcărești Monastery because his palace was severely damaged. However, despite the massive damage to buildings, only four deaths were reported: a Jewish woman and her baby, an itinerant merchant killed when Colțea Tower collapsed, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> victim. The death toll may have been so low because the houses were built far apart and surrounded by large yards and gardens, so the buildings' vibrations did not propagate. Also, the building materials—mostly shingle and timber—were light.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Alma of the 2008 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was the easternmost forming Pacific tropical cyclone on record. It formed within the monsoon trough {{just off the}} coast of Costa Rica on May 29. Initially forecast to remain a weak tropical storm, the cyclone rapidly strengthened and developed an eye before making landfall in Nicaragua near León with peak winds of 65mph (100km/h). Alma was the first tropical storm on record to strike the Pacific coast of Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, heavy rainfall caused flooding and landslides, killing two and causing $35million (USD) in damage. Three people were killed in Nicaragua, one from drowning and two others from electrocution. Five others died in Honduras from an aviation accident likely related to the storm <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> was swept away in floodwaters.|$|E

5|$|Union {{military}} leaders assigned Lieutenant Colonel Samuel P. Cox to kill Anderson, providing {{him with a}} group of experienced soldiers. Soon after Anderson left Glasgow, a local woman saw him and told Cox of his presence. On October 26, 1864, he pursued Anderson's group with 150 men and engaged them in battle. Anderson and his men charged the Union forces, killing five or six of them, but turned back under heavy fire. Only Anderson <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> man, the son of a Confederate general, continued to charge after the others retreated. Anderson was hit by a bullet behind an ear, likely killing him instantly. Four other guerrillas were killed in the attack. The victory made a hero of Cox and led to his promotion.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the first}} phase of the {{operation}} had been scheduled for 8 May, no word was received from the 'Heralds' and so Doomsday was postponed by twenty-four hours. Contact was successfully established on 9 May and the first units of Force 134 arrived in Norway to begin their occupation, including the first elements of 1st Airborne Division and the Norwegian Parachute Company. All but one of the transport aircraft belonging to {{the first phase}} took off and landed in Norway without incident. Phase II was accelerated to compensate for the delay, with aircraft scheduled to leave Britain between 02:00 and 13:30. Unfortunately, after approximately 07:00 poor weather over Oslo caused many transport aircraft heading for the airfield there to return to Britain, although all of those destined for Stavanger landed successfully. Several crash-landed, and one was reported missing. The remaining aircraft took off again on 11 May, with one crashing on takeoff and another going missing; of the two missing aircraft, one landed at another airfield in Norway, but the other had crashed killing all of its occupants, including Air Vice-Marshal Scarlett-Streatfeild. The aircraft belonging to the next two phases suffered no more casualties, although a number of them were again delayed by inclement weather over the Norwegian airfields. 1st Airborne Division suffered one officer and thirty-three other ranks killed, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> rank wounded, and the Royal Air Force six killed and seven injured. All of these losses had occurred after the general surrender had been declared.|$|E

Guns malfunctioned on the recently commissioned British ship, which still had civilian technicians aboard. Despite the technical faults in the main battery, Prince of Wales scored three hits on Bismarck in the engagement. The first struck her in the forecastle above the waterline but low enough to allow the crashing waves to enter the hull. The second shell struck below the armoured belt and exploded on contact with the torpedo bulkhead completely flooding a turbo-generator room and partially flooding an adjacent boiler room. The third shell passed {{through one of the}} boats carried aboard the ship and then went through the floatplane catapult without exploding.|$|E
