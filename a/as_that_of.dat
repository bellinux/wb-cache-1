5|$|A {{juvenile}} {{often has}} a dark, brownish-grey nape that may look {{darker than the}} pale-edged black feathers. It has a dark grey to black head, neck, and upperparts, with white throat, cheeks, and underparts. During the first winter, the bill shape of the young {{may not be as}} fully developed <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the adult, and during the second winter, it much resembles the breeding adult, but with wing coverts lacking white spots.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, three doctors {{involved}} in Smith's treatment during her incarceration challenged {{the expansion of}} the inquest to include events that took place outside the province of Ontario.

5|$|After {{the first}} two shows of season two, Jim Shelley in The Guardian, called The Wire the best show on TV, praising the second season {{for its ability to}} detach from its former {{foundations}} in the first season. Jon Garelick with the Boston Phoenix was of the opinion that the subculture of the docks (second season) was not as absorbing <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the housing projects (first season), but he went on to praise the writers for creating a realistic world and populating it with an array of interesting characters.|$|E
5|$|Alley's {{retirement}} {{was marked}} {{by a series of}} discharges from the military, trials, and prison sentences. At one trial, Zinsou's conduct sparked another coup led by Kouandété. On October 26, 1972, Mathieu Kérékou seized power in a coup. He ended Alley's military career, as well <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> every other senior officer, and named Alley commissioner of the National Oil Wells (SNADAH), a role with very little responsibility. Kérékou accused Alley of plotting against him on February 28, 1973, and sentenced the latter to 20 years in prison. He died on March 28, 1987.|$|E
5|$|Apotropaics—items able to {{ward off}} revenants—are common in vampire folklore. Garlic is a common example, a branch of wild rose and {{hawthorn}} plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, sprinkling mustard seeds {{on the roof of}} a house was said to keep them away. Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a crucifix, rosary, or holy water. Vampires are said to be unable to walk on consecrated ground, such <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> churches or temples, or cross running water.|$|E

5|$|Arsenic and {{antimony}} are not semiconductors {{in their}} standard states.

These compounds are preferred for some special applications. Antimony nanocrystals may enable lithium-ion batteries to be replaced by more powerful sodium ion batteries.|$|E
5|$|At {{the trial}} in 1884, {{prosecutors}} implicated the sisters in the three other deaths in their household, as well <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Thomas Higgins, {{with which they were}} officially charged. Catherine Flannagan's offer to provide evidence against other conspirators for the prosecution in exchange for leniency was refused. The sisters were found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. The sentence was carried out on 3 March 1884 at Kirkdale Prison, with the sisters attended to by a Roman Catholic priest. The deaths were witnessed by a reported one thousand people.|$|E
5|$|Banksia cuneata is {{most easily}} {{distinguished}} from the other two species in B.subg. Isostylis by its brighter flowers and duller leaves. It further differs from B.ilicifolia in its smaller habit; its smooth bark; its smaller leaves, flowers and fruit; and in its sequence of flower colour changes. The leaves, flowers and fruit of B.oligantha are smaller still, and its foliage is not as prickly <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> B.cuneata.|$|E

5|$|Before the Baroque era, {{keyboard}} music generally was {{not written}} for one instrument or another, but rather was written {{to be played}} on any keyboard instrument. For this reason, much of the organ's repertoire through the Renaissance period is the same <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the harpsichord. Pre-Renaissance keyboard music is found in compiled manuscripts that may include compositions {{from a variety of}} regions. The oldest of these sources is the Robertsbridge Codex, dating from about 1360. The Buxheimer Orgelbuch, which dates from about 1470 and was compiled in Germany, includes intabulations of vocal music by the English composer John Dunstaple. The earliest Italian organ music is found in the Faenza Codex, dating from 1420.|$|E
5|$|Between 1983 and 1989 the {{paintings}} underwent technical examination and were extensively restored and cleaned. Technical {{analysis of the}} Philadelphia painting established that the wood panel comes from the same tree <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> two paintings definitively attributed to van Eyck, and that the Italian panel has underdrawings of a quality that it is thought could only have come from him. After nearly 500 years, {{the paintings}} were reunited in 1998 in an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Today {{the consensus is that}} both were painted by the same hand.|$|E

5|$|Cairano's career covers {{just over}} two decades (circa 1490–1510), a {{relatively}} short period, during which, moreover, the majority of works produced is concentrated in the latter decade. Among these, nearly three-quarters are religious commissions, executed {{mainly because of the}} greater funding available from such sources and the increased likelihood of their conservation over time. Numerous sculptures also stemmed from private commissions, especially funerary tombs, as well as secular cycles such <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Caesars. In many works, there is an evident, and sometimes overwhelming architectural component that indicates the careful preparations made by Cairano in this field. Cairano was lauded, as for example by the municipality of Chiari where he was explicitly named lapicida architectum et ingeniarum optimum.|$|E
5|$|Cerium has a {{variable}} electronic structure. The {{energy of the}} 4f electron is nearly the same <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and {{only a small amount}} of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. It appears that the valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed.|$|E

5|$|Chapter seven {{deals with}} conceptions of {{morality}} and ethics, arguing that whereas High Magic typically envisions a dualistic world view of good versus evil, Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence are seen as intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the pseudo-scientific nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe {{as a part of}} moral discourse. She looks at the internal source of morality in High Magic, explaining concepts such <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Qliphoth, before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.|$|E
5|$|Charles III {{also made}} serious {{attempts}} to find the various works of art and furniture looted, sold and dispersed during the revolution. Together with new purchases, a fine art collection once again adorned the palace which included not only family portraits such <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Lucien I by de Predis; Honoré II by Philippe de Champaigne; the head of Antoine I by Hyacinthe Rigaud, and van Loo's portrait of Louise-Hyppolyte (Illustration 11) but also such masterpieces as The Music Lesson by Titian.|$|E
5|$|Crumley {{was born}} in Dundee in 1890, the son of William Ferguson Crumley, a tinsmith. His older brother, Bob Crumley, also played professionally as a goalkeeper, {{and was in the}} Dundee team that won the 1910 Scottish Cup Final, {{defeating}} Clyde after two replays. The passenger list when he sailed for America in 1912 listed his occupation <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> blacksmith. During the First World War, Crumley joined the Royal Engineers. By mid-1915, he was a section corporal stationed near Dundee, and he went to reach the rank of sergeant and served in France. He was twice mentioned in despatches, and was wounded and affected by shell shock.|$|E
