500|$|<b>Academically</b> Quisling proved <b>talented</b> in humanities, {{particularly}} history, {{and natural}} sciences; he specialised in mathematics. At this point, however, {{his life had}} no clear direction. In 1905, Quisling enrolled at the Norwegian Military Academy, having received the highest entrance examination score of the 250 applicants that year. Transferring in 1906 to the Norwegian Military College, he graduated with the highest score since the college's inception in 1817, and was rewarded by an audience with the King. On 1November1911, he joined the army General Staff. Norway was neutral in the First World War; Quisling detested the peace movement, though the high human cost of the war did temper his views. In March 1918, {{he was sent to}} Russia as an attaché at the Norwegian legation in Petrograd, {{to take advantage of the}} five years he had spent studying the country. Though dismayed at the living conditions he experienced, Quisling nonetheless concluded that [...] "the Bolsheviks have got an extraordinarily strong hold on Russian society" [...] and marvelled at how Leon Trotsky had managed to mobilise Red Army forces so well; by contrast, in granting too many rights to the people of Russia, the Russian Provisional Government under Alexander Kerensky had brought about its own downfall. When the legation was recalled in December 1918, Quisling became the Norwegian military's expert on Russian affairs.|$|R
2500|$|Generally, most student-athletes are {{legitimate}} students who study and pass and succeed academically, {{but in some}} schools {{there is a small}} percentage of athletes, particularly in revenue-producing sports such as basketball and football, in which there are academic improprieties. A major allegation in this particular scandal is that the university funneled students into [...] "make-believe courses" [...] and subsequently stamped their transcripts with [...] "inflated grades", such that the students received [...] "little or no real education". That colleges have been admitting some <b>academically</b> ill-prepared but <b>talented</b> athletes for many decades is an [...] "age-old problem", and once in school, the schools must maintain the pretense that these admitted students are remaining in good academic standing, but it is difficult for some of these student-athletes to keep up academically. A CNN investigation estimated that the percentage of so-called [...] "revenue sport athletes" [...] who were reading at an elementary school level was approximately 7% to 18%, with some schools having even higher percentages reading at below college levels; an analysis by Oklahoma professor Gerald Gurney estimated that a tenth of revenue-sport athletes were reading below a fourth-grade level. Still, in the drive to win victory in NCAA tournaments, there is tremendous pressure to recruit top athletes to these schools regardless of their academic ability. Many schools believe that excellent tutoring and extra attention off the field help their athletes succeed after school.|$|R
