With characteristic humbleness, Ili said after the game that his job was made <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> by the talented players around him, such as his backcourt starting partner Corey Webster. Throughout April, Ili continued his maturation into the league's best local point guard. On 17 April, he had 22 points and 15 assists in a 102–79 win over the Canterbury Rams. Eight days later, he had 27 points, 10 assists and six steals in a 110–84 win over the Nelson Giants. On 19 May, he scored a career-high 30 points in a 109–94 win over the Southland Sharks. He guided the Saints to a perfect 18–0 regular season and helped them earn another grand final appearance. In the NZNBL championship decider on 17 June, Ili set a new career high with 31 points in the Saints' 108–75 rout of the Sharks. The win saw the Saints collect their 10th NBL Championship, with Ili winning his third straight NZNBL title. The Saints became the first team to complete an unbeaten season, capping off a perfect 20–0 campaign with their grand final win over Southland. Ili's 31-point effort earned him Finals MVP honours.

25|$|Melanoma only {{occurs in}} a small {{proportion}} of the population. Only 10% of those who have melanoma acquired it genetically. This disease is an autosomal dominant gene. If only two family members have melanoma, there is a 5% chance somebody in the next generation will acquire the mutated gene. Also, there is a 20-40% chance of getting hereditary melanoma in a family if 3 or more people in the past generation had melanoma. For those who carry the hereditary mutated gene CDKN2A, acquiring skin cancer is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier.</b> Those who have the gene {{are far more likely to}} get melanoma a second or third time compared to those who don’t genetically have this gene. The population that is affected by this mutation has a high familial history of melanoma or atypical moles and birth marks in large numbers, a history of primary melanoma/cancers in general, immunosuppression, skin that burns easily and doesn't tan, freckling, blue eyes, red hair, or a history of blistering. People with these high risk factors are more likely to carry inherited mutations in CDKN2A. For those who have a gene mutation, the severity is also dependent on the environmental surroundings. Out of those who carry the gene, those who express the phenotype and actually developed melanoma have a history of more sun exposure, and light skin compared to those who also had the gene but never actually developed melanoma. This suggests that this gene co-works with ones surrounding environment. If two individuals are selected who carry the CDKN2A mutation, and both genetically have the same probability of acquiring skin cancer, but one is from Australia and the other is from Europe, there is a 58% the European will acquire cancer compared to a 91% chance the Australian will get it.
