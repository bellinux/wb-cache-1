25|$|In 1970, the {{government}} enacted new federal air pollution regulations. Since New York City was {{in violation of}} these new regulations, it was given until 1975 to be compliant; this was later pushed back to 1977 after the state was given a 2-year delay in implementing the standards. Mayor Lindsay and the federal Environmental Protection Agency developed a plan to collect tolls on twelve free bridges across the Harlem and East Rivers, banning midtown parking, and significantly {{reducing the number of}} parking spaces south of 59th Street. They also proposed to retrofit <b>air</b> <b>filtering</b> devices on cars entering New York City's main business districts. The successive mayor, Abraham Beame, refused to implement the plan, even after federal order in 1975, but environmentalists received a court order in 1976 to proceed with implementation. Yet as the federal legislature forbade the bridge tolls and taxi restrictions went into effect, the parking ban remained the most controversial and consequential aspect of the act, and its forced implementation was poorly executed. In April 1977, Beame's administration released a report that opposed the addition of tolls, a proposal that future Mayor Michael Bloomberg's congestion pricing plan would address thirty years later. The report supported a bill in the New York State Legislature that, if passed, would permanently ban tolls on the East River bridges. Although such a plan would generate revenue for the city, the administration concluded that tolling the free crossings would cause congestion and pollution without enticing drivers to use public transportation. The state departments of environment and transportation concurred with Beame's position, and in a May 1977 report, recommended that tolls not be enacted, {{despite the fact that the}} pollution standards had yet to be met.|$|E
500|$|The AMX-30 has {{a number}} of {{different}} variations, including a number of other armoured vehicles based on the same chassis. A simplified version of the tank, without the infra-red searchlight and periscopes and a less complex commander's cupola was developed for export, known as the [...] "basic AMX-30". This version also came devoid of the pressurized <b>air</b> <b>filtering</b> system, and moved the smaller [...] machine gun into the coaxial position and the larger [...] M2 to the turret roof. Another version was considered for the French Army, adopting a [...] tank gun able to fire the supersonic [...] (Anti-Char Rapide Autopropulsé) anti-tank guided missile, as well as high explosive rounds. A prototype was finished in 1967 with a new cast turret, wide enough to hold the much larger armament. However, the high costs of the missiles forced the French Army to abandon the program in 1972. The vehicles based on the chassis include an armoured recovery vehicle, a bridgelayer, a self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle, a tactical nuclear missile launcher and a self-propelled artillery piece.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of the engine air induction system has recently increased because of governmental engine exhaust particulate and evaporative emission regulations. This has created {{a renewed interest in}} optimizing the existing parameters of the air induction mechanism like the <b>air</b> <b>filter,</b> filter box, piping etc for better performance. <b>Air</b> <b>filter</b> provided on the engine intake is subjected to increased levels of abuse due to the diverse driving conditions.

It is shown that the concentration density maxima of the small dispersive coal dust particles appear in the granular filtering medium with the cylindrical coal absorbent granules in the horizontal iodine <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> at an action by the air dust aerosol blow. The comparison of the measured aerodynamic resistances of the horizontal and vertical iodine <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> is conducted. The main conclusion is that {{the magnitude of the}} aerodynamic resistance of the horizontal iodine <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> is much smaller in comparison with the magnitude of the aerodynamic resistance of the vertical iodine <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> at the same loads of the air dust aerosol volumes. It is explained that the direction of the air dust aerosol blow and the direction of the gravitation force in the horizontal iodine <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> are orthogonal, hence the effective accumulation of the small dispersive coal dust particles takes place at the bottom of absorber in the horizontal iodine <b>air</b> <b>filter.</b> It is found that the air dust aerosol stream flow in the horizontal iodine <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> is not limited by the appearing structures, made of the precipitated small dispersive coal dust particles, in distinction from the vertical iodine <b>air</b> <b>filter,</b> in the process of long term operation of the iodine <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> at the nuclear power plant.

However, the importance and performance evaluation of <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> have not been well publicized and related scientific reports are scarce. In this study, a transportable, off-line, air filter-testing unit (the Unit) was designed and utilized to simulate the filter housing of a mechanical ventilation system. The Unit was designed, assembled, and operated in a laboratory. To demonstrate the applications of the Unit, a series of <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> handling and installation scenarios was performed to determine the characteristic curve and capture efficiencies of a selected set of HEPA filters. The research project produced a transportable, closed system <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> testing unit.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>filter</b> {{manufacturers}} have recently begun marketing premium <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> that provide very high particle capture efficiencies with very low initial static pressure drops. This is accomplished with proprietary filter designs incorporating {{at least twice}} the media surface area of traditional filters. 1 The increased media reduces the initial pressure drop of <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> while dramatically increasing their dust holding capacity. In addition, their useful lives are extended and prefilter use may be eliminated. Physical principals governing airflow in fan systems predict available energy savings from using premium <b>air</b> <b>filters.</b> This energy savings may offset the additional cost of the premium filters. In fact, premium filter investments can payback in six months to three years depending on airflow and number of hours of fan operation. Additional benefits of using premium <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> include longer filter life, lower installation and disposal costs, elimination of prefilters {{and the ability to}} increase effective filter efficiency in buildings without reducing ventilation effectiveness. A case study was conducted in an office building with two nearly identical VAV systems to determine if premium <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> are good investments for building owners and managers. This paper presents performance characteristics including fan energy use and static pressure drops across both premium and typical <b>air</b> <b>filters.</b> The performance data were used to test the validity of one manufacturer’s claim concerning their premium filters, fan energy reduction and improved indoor air quality.
