5|$|The {{length of}} time that Detox had been record for, {{as well as the}} limited amount of {{material}} that had been officially released or leaked from the recording sessions, had given it considerable notoriety within the music industry.

Several musicians closely affiliated with Dr. Dre, including Snoop Dogg, fellow rappers 50 Cent and Game and producer DJ Quik, had speculated in interviews that the album will never be released, due to Dr. Dre's business <b>and</b> <b>entrepreneurial</b> ventures having interfered with recording work, as well as causing him to lose motivation to record new material.|$|E

25|$|A {{more recent}} study {{suggests}} that EI {{is not necessarily a}} universally positive trait. They found a negative correlation between EI and managerial work demands; while under low levels of managerial work demands, they found a negative relationship between EI and teamwork effectiveness. An explanation for this may suggest gender differences in EI, as women tend to score higher levels than men. This furthers the idea that job context plays a role in the relationships between EI, teamwork effectiveness, and job performance. Another interesting find was discussed in a study that assessed a possible link between EI <b>and</b> <b>entrepreneurial</b> behaviors and success.|$|E
25|$|A {{prominent}} {{example of}} a monarch who took the Enlightenment project seriously was Joseph II of Austria, who ruled from 1780 to 1790 and implemented {{a wide array of}} radical reforms, such as the complete abolition of serfdom, the imposition of equal taxation policies between the aristocracy and the peasantry, the institution of religious toleration, including equal civil rights for Jews, and the suppression of Catholic religious authority throughout his empire, creating a more secular nation.

25|$|At reunification, the {{state-controlled economy}} that had {{formerly}} run North Vietnam was extended into South Vietnam, which saw {{the dissolution of}} its capital <b>and</b> <b>entrepreneurial</b> institutions. This, along with a combined mass movement of North Vietnamese to the wealthier South and mass exodus of capital assets to the United States, saw the South Vietnamese economy collapse, creating a period of economic decline for the entire country until the unified government began market socialist reforms in the late 1980s. Near reunification, North Vietnam had a greater population of 23.8 million compared to South Vietnam's 19.6 million. Nevertheless, the difference is of a much closer ratio than that of current North and South Korea.|$|E

25|$|As Málaga {{pioneered the}} Industrial Revolution in Spain, its educated <b>and</b> <b>entrepreneurial</b> {{merchant}} class agitated for modernity in government, making Málaga {{one of the}} most rebellious cities of the country. The bourgeoisie led several uprisings in favor of a more liberal regime to encourage free commercial enterprise. In 1834, soon after the death of Ferdinand VII, a revolt was organized against the inefficiency of the government of the Count of Toreno (Conde de Toreno), who had been appointed prime minister by the queen regent, Maria Christina on 7 June. His tenure in the premiership lasted only till 14 September. A year later the civil and military governors of Málaga, the Conde Donadio and Señor San Justo, were killed in a violent insurrection.|$|E
25|$|The quasi-industrialization of his {{practice}} set Revere {{apart from his}} competition. “Revere’s rapid foundry success resulted from fortuitous timing, innate technical aptitude, thorough research, and the casting experience he gained from silverworking.” This technical proficiency allowed Revere to optimize his work and adapt to a new technological <b>and</b> <b>entrepreneurial</b> model. Revere’s location also benefited his endeavors. Revere was entering the field of iron casting {{in a time when}} New England cities were becoming centers of industry. The nature of technological advancement was such that many skilled entrepreneurs in a number of fields worked together, in what is known by Nathan Rosenberg as technological convergence, by which a number of companies work together on challenges in order to spur advances. By accessing the knowledge of other nearby metal workers, Revere was able to successfully explore and master new technologies throughout his career.|$|E
