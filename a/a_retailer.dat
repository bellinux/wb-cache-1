5|$|In 1996, Jewell {{joined the}} board of Recreational Equipment Inc. (REI) and in 2000 was named chief {{operating}} officer.

Jewell was named the Puget Sound Business Journal CEO of the Year in 2006. By 2012, Jewell noted that the REI co-op had facilitated 3million hours of volunteer work in parks and other natural outdoor spaces and spent three percent of its annual profits on outdoor stewardship. During her tenure at REI, annual sales grew from $600 million in 2005 to more than $2billion in 2015, and the company doubled the number of its retail stores. Jewell remained CEO of REI until she was named Secretary of the Interior in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Trans Polar was a {{continuation}} of Tjøntveit's United States-based Trans Polar International, <b>a</b> <b>retailer</b> of general aviation aircraft. Born in Grimstad, Tjøntviet emigrated to the US in 1961 after receiving his pilot's license and became an American citizen in 1965. Trans Polar International agreed on 25 November 1969 to purchase two Boeing 720 jetliners from Eastern Air Lines. The original plans called for transporting new general aviation aircraft to customers around the world. Tjøntveit stated that the first aircraft would be delivered in May 1970 and followed by a second in December, and that Erik Sandberg would start working as vice president in May. The airline planned to hire ten pilots and had {{signed an agreement with}} Pan Am for ground handling services. Trans Polar International stated they had made agreements to operate the aircraft transport flights for at least five years.|$|E

50|$|Some {{argue that}} online shopping, which makes price {{comparison}} easier for customers, encourages <b>a</b> 'race-to-the-bottom', where <b>retailers</b> only compete on price, with quality and service deteriorating as a result.

40|$|The lion’s {{share of}} retail traffic through search engines {{originates}} from organic (natural) rather than sponsored (paid) links. We use a dataset constructed from over 12, 000 search terms and 2 million users to identify drivers {{of the organic}} clicks that the top 759 retailers received from search engines in August 2012. Our results are potentially important for search engine optimization (SEO). We find that <b>a</b> <b>retailer’s</b> investments in {{factors such as the}} quality and brand awareness of its site increases organic clicks through both a direct and an indirect effect. The direct effect stems purely from consumer behavior: The higher the quality of <b>an</b> online <b>retailer,</b> the greater the number of consumers who click its link rather than a competitor in the list of organic results. The indirect effect stems from our finding that search engines tend to place higher quality sites in better positions, which results in additional clicks since consumers tend to click links in more favorable positions. We also find that consumers who are older, wealthier, conduct searches from work, use fewer words or include a brand name product in their search are more likely to click <b>a</b> <b>retailer’s</b> organic link following a product search. Finally, the quality of <b>a</b> <b>retailer’s</b> site appears to be especially important in attracting organic traffi...|$|R

25|$|For <b>a</b> <b>retailer,</b> {{finding the}} right balance between breadth and depth can be a key to success. An average {{supermarket}} might carry 30,000–60,000 different product lines (product length or assortment), but might carry up to 100 different types of toothpaste (product depth). Specialty retailers typically carry fewer product lines, perhaps as few as 20 lines, but will normally stock greater depth. Costco, for example, carries 5,000 different lines while Aldi carries just 1,400 lines per store.|$|E
25|$|The UK Government {{introduced}} on 1 August 2008 regulations {{requiring the}} production of personal identification and vehicle registration documents when having number plates made by <b>a</b> <b>retailer.</b> The organisation that makes the plate is required to display their name and postcode, usually in small print at bottom centre, to aid in tracing false plates and their purchaser.

While the company enjoyed some success in gaining substantial market share from traditional leaders in the space, particularly with plasma TVs and digital cameras, the limited short-term profit potential of those product lines led then-CEO Wayne Inouye to pull the company out of that segment during 2004. Gateway still acts as <b>a</b> <b>retailer</b> selling third-party electronic goods online.|$|E
40|$|Consumer {{evaluation}} of products offered by <b>a</b> given <b>retailer</b> is often influenced by {{perceptions of the}} overall price level of all offerings from this retailer. Because of its direct impact on consumer choice, understanding and managing price image is of key importance to retailers. Despite its theoretical and managerial importance, however, very little research has explicitly explored the role of <b>a</b> <b>retailer’s</b> price image in consumer buying behavior. Indeed, while we now {{know a great deal}} about how consumers evaluate individual prices, we know relatively little about how consumers form an overall impression of <b>a</b> <b>retailer’s</b> price image. This article addresses this gap by offering a conceptual framework that draws on the existing research to identify the key antecedents and consequences of price image. Building on this framework, we advance a set of testable research propositions that serve as an agenda for future research...|$|R

25|$|When a {{contract}} is entered into after the misrepresentation {{of a third}} party, this area resembles the law on undue influence. In TSB Bank plc v Camfield, a wife guaranteed repayment of her husband's partnership's loan through a mortgage over her house. Her husband's innocently misrepresented that the maximum liability was £15,000. Applying Barclays Bank plc v O'Brien the court held she was allowed to rescind the agreement. She had not given true consent to the charge.

Meanwhile, Instinct opted to sell two different types of bikes and dog transportation accessories, though failed to achieve orders from <b>a</b> <b>retailer,</b> due to them being unsuitable for them. However, their sales to the smaller stores were far better, with the other retailer giving them a massive order, effectively winning them the task.|$|E
25|$|Volume risk {{is often}} used to denote the {{phenomenon}} whereby electricity market participants have uncertain volumes or quantities of consumption or production. For example, <b>a</b> <b>retailer</b> is unable to accurately predict consumer demand for any particular hour {{more than a few days}} into the future and a producer is unable to predict the precise time that they will have plant outage or shortages of fuel. A compounding factor is also the common correlation between extreme price and volume events. For example, price spikes frequently occur when some producers have plant outages or when some consumers are in a period of peak consumption. The introduction of substantial amounts of intermittent power sources such as wind energy may affect market prices.|$|E
