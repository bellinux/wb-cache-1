5|$|The {{explanation}} for the green and red colours {{that make up the}} background field arose during the Estado Novo period, the nationalist authoritarian regime that held power from 1933 to 1974. It claims that the green represented the hope of the Portuguese people, while the red represented the blood of those who died serving the nation. Sources believe these noble meanings <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the truth and are nothing more than propaganda, to provide an honourable justification to their choice.|$|E
5|$|The form of {{this ancient}} Greek poetry is an elegiac couplet, {{commonly}} used for epitaphs. Some English renderings are given in the table below. It is also an example of Laconian brevity, a spartan style of verse that allows for varying interpretations {{of the meaning of}} the poem. Ioannis Ziogas points out that the usual English translations <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the only interpretation possible, and indicate much about the romantic tendencies of the translators.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{analyses}} {{show that}} detours that increase flight distance {{by up to}} 20% will often be adaptive on aerodynamic grounds – a bird that loads itself with food to cross a long barrier flies less efficiently. However some species show circuitous migratory routes that reflect historical range expansions and <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> optimal in ecological terms. An example is the migration of continental populations of Swainson's thrush Catharus ustulatus, which fly far east across North America before turning south via Florida to reach northern South America; this route {{is believed to be}} the consequence of a range expansion that occurred about 10,000 years ago. Detours may also be caused by differential wind conditions, predation risk, or other factors.|$|E

5|$|This {{record of}} disputed {{succession}} {{was by no}} means unique to Northumbria, and the kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex experienced similar troubles during the eighth and ninth centuries. In Wessex, from the death of Centwine in 685 to Egbert's seizure of power in 802, the relationships between successive kings <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> clear and few kings are known to have been close kinsmen of their predecessors or successors. The same may be true of Mercia from the death of Ceolred in 716 until the disappearance of the Mercian kingdom in the late ninth century.|$|E
5|$|Gjirokastër is principally a {{commercial}} center with some industries, notably {{the production of}} foodstuffs, leather, and textiles. Recently a regional agricultural market that trades locally produced groceries has {{been built in the}} city. Given the potential of southern Albania to supply organically grown products, and its relationship with Greek counterparts of the nearby city of Ioannina, {{it is likely that the}} market will dedicate itself to organic farming in the future. However, currently trademarking and marketing of such products <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> European standards. The Chamber of Commerce of the city, created in 1988, promotes trade with the Greek border areas. As part of the financial support from Greece to Albania, the Hellenic Armed Forces built a hospital in the city.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Gorrostieta Salazar {{was elected}} mayor of Tiquicheo. Several drug {{trafficking}} organizations, particularly the La Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar Cartel, {{are based in}} the area. Michoacán is a leading producer of marijuana and opium poppy, making it a lucrative route for smugglers taking narcotics into the United States. Despite receiving threats, Gorrostieta Salazar publicly denounced the activities of these groups. The drug cartels, which are constantly fighting each other for territorial control, often target mayors who confront them. Other mayors, however, are corrupted and bribed by the cartels. Mexico has more than 2,500 municipalities, many of which <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the capital cities and lack amenities available {{in other parts of}} the country. Many of these areas are plagued with drug-related violence, so the political parties have faced difficulties finding people interested in holding the post of mayor.|$|E

5|$|The {{processes}} {{responsible for}} the exceptional preservational quality of the Burgess Shale fossils <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> clear. The interpretation of what is preserved depends partly on two issues that are interlinked: whether the animals were buried where they lived, or washed long distances by sediment flows; and whether the water at the burial sites was anoxic or provided enough oxygen to sustain animals. The traditional view is that soft bodies and organs could only be preserved in anoxic conditions, otherwise oxygen-breathing bacteria would have made decomposition too rapid for fossilization. This would imply that the sea-floor organisms could not have lived there. However, in 2006 Caron and Jackson concluded that the sea-floor animals were buried where they lived. One of their main reasons was that many fossils represented partially decayed soft-bodied animals such as polychaetes, which had already died shortly before the burial event, {{and would have been}} fragmented if they had been transported any significant distance by a storm of swirling sediment. Other evidence for burial where the animals had lived includes the presence of tubes and burrows, and of assemblies of animals preserved while they fed – such as a group of carnivorous priapulids clustered round a freshly moulted arthropod whose new cuticle would not yet have hardened. Fossilized swimming organisms were also buried immediately below where they lived.|$|E
