5|$|HD 154672 b {{was later}} {{observed}} {{by a different}} team of astronomers investigating the role of metallicity, or the amount of metal present in <b>a</b> <b>star,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formation of planets. Six radial velocity measurements of the host star, collected using the HARPS instrument at Chile's La Silla Observatory. The team used the radial velocity data to refine the parameters of HD 154672 b from what was published in its discovery paper a year earlier.|$|E
5|$|Sakurai's Object (V4334 Sgr) is <b>a</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{constellation}} of Sagittarius.
