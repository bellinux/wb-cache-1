5|$|As the North West trade {{developed}} {{it became}} riskier to depend solely upon acquiring sea otter furs through {{trade with the}} indigenous people of the coast. Diversification began {{in the first decade}} of the 19th century if not earlier, and increased over time. Maritime fur trading voyages were no longer solely about taking sea otter furs from the North West Coast to Canton. Other commodities and markets throughout the Pacific were added to the system. Sandalwood, mainly from Hawaii, became an important item of the China trade. Just as the sea otter trade was waning the sandalwood trade boomed, peaking in 1821, then declined. Hawaiian sandalwood was depleted by 1830. Fiji and the Marquesas Islands were the other principal sources of sandalwood. Most had been cut by 1820. Fiji was also a source of bêche-de-mer, a gourmet delicacy in China. American traders began acquiring Fijian bêche-de-mer in 1804 and trepanging boomed there. Bêche-de-mer became Fiji's leading export by 1830. Depletion led to a decline and the end of the trade by 1850. Trepanging was also done from 1812 in Hawaii and from 1814 in the Marquesas. Other side trades included Chilean copper from Valparaíso, scrimshaw (whale teeth), tortoise shells and meat from the Galápagos Islands, sugar from Manila, and, from Java, <b>areca</b> <b>nuts</b> (so-called betel nuts) and coffee beans. Sealing boomed in the Juan Fernández Islands and the Juan Fernández fur seal was rapidly exploited to near-extinction. The northern fur seal rookeries were controlled by Russia, so Americans acquired northern fur seal skins through trade rather than sealing.|$|E

Our previous studies have demonstrated the activation of TGF-beta signaling in epithelial cells by <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> components and also propose a role for epithelial expressed TGF-beta in the pathogenesis of OSF. Although the importance of epithelial cells in the manifestation of OSF has been proposed, the actual effectors are fibroblast cells.

40|$|Oral submucous {{fibrosis}} (OSF) is {{a debilitating}} irreversible fibrotic {{condition of the}} oral cavity. It is characterized by inflammation and ultimately results in trismus. Patients face difficulty in speaking, swallowing and chewing due to restricted mouth opening (trismus). This disease is also categorized as an oral premalignant disorder (OPMD). Recent reports cite a conversion rate of 10 % from OSF to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Epidemiological studies and case reports {{over the years have}} correlated the habit of chewing <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> (Areca catechu) to the manifestation of OSF. It is a major cause of concern in the South and South East Asian parts of the world where <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> is cultivated and routinely consumed. There are an estimated 700 million <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> chewers around the globe with 0. 5 % of the population in the Indian subcontinent being affected by OSF due to this habit. Previous studies have reported differential gene expression profile and up regulation of the pro-fibrotic transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway in OSF. However, detailed molecular mechanisms for the pathogenesis of this disease are still unclear despite our knowledge about the etiological agent (<b>areca</b> <b>nut)</b> responsible for its progression. Therefore, to gain insights into the etiopathogeneses of OSF, following objectives were undertaken: 	To study the gene expression changes induced by <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> and pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF-β in primary fibroblast cells, and their implications in OSF. 	To elucidate the mechanism of TGF-β signal activation in epithelial cells by <b>areca</b> <b>nut.</b> Fibroblast cells are the effectors in all fibrotic disorders. Therefore, it is essential to study the response of this cell type in fibrosis. With prior knowledge of the activation of TGF-β pathway in OSF and the etiological agent of this disease being areca nut; we wanted to study the differential gene response of fibroblasts to these two agents. For this purpose, human primary gingival fibroblasts (hGF) were used as a model system to study the global gene expression profile regulated by <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> and/or TGF-β. hGF cells were treated with sub-cytotoxic dose of <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> (5 µg/ml) with and without TGF-β (5 ng/ml) for 72 hours and microarray was performed. The results revealed 4666 genes being differentially regulated by <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> in hGF cells while TGF-β regulated 1214 genes. Both of them together differentially regulated 5752 genes. 413 genes which were commonly regulated by <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> and TGF-β were observed to have enhanced regulation with a combined treatment of <b>areca</b> <b>nut,</b> together with TGF-β. This result pointed towards the potential role of both <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> and TGF-β in modulating fibroblast response. To further assess the role of <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> in OSF manifestation, we first compared the transcriptome profile induced by it in epithelial cells with fibroblast cells. Areca nut was found to induce differential response in these two cell types which corroborates with the disease pathology wherein; epithelial atrophy is observed and conversely fibroblasts are proliferative. To extend these observations we compared the <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> induced profile in epithelial cells with OSF differential profile and found {{that a majority of the}} genes regulated by <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> which were common with OSF are regulated by TGF-β. Similarly, <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> and TGF-β regulated profile in fibroblast cells overlapped significantly with OSF profile. Additionally, <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> and TGF-β treatment positively enriched matrix associated and metabolic pathways among others which are reported to be differentially regulated in OSF. These observations also highlighted the importance of combined actions of <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> and TGF-β in OSF manifestation. To test the physiological importance of combined actions of <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> and TGF-β in the context of OSF; activation of fibroblasts by these treatments was assessed. Treatment of fibroblasts with <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> and TGF-β enhanced the expression of myofibroblast markers αSMA and γSMA with a concomitant increase in the contractile property when compared to <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> or TGF-β treatment alone. Further, we observed that <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> did not regulate any of the TGF-β ligands or receptors in fibroblasts, whereas it induced TGF-β 2 in epithelial cells. Therefore, this invoked a possible epithelial-mesenchymal interaction that may exist in OSF pathogenesis. To test this possibility in-vitro, epithelial cells were treated with <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> and the secretome of these cells was put on hGF cells to study the regulation of fibrosis associated genes. This treatment enhanced the regulation of fibroblast activation markers (αSMA and γSMA) as compared to direct <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> treatment. This increase in regulation was abrogated when induction of TGF-β 2 was compromised in epithelial cells. Similar results were obtained for the regulation of other genes (TGM- 2, THBS- 1, EDN 1, LOXL 3, PLOD 2, TMEPAI, TGFBI, CTGF, BMP 1, LMIK 1). Therefore, we concluded that TGF-β which is secreted in response to <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> by epithelial cells influences fibroblasts in combination with <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> to enhance fibrosis response. Furthermore, the secretome of untreated epithelial cells was found to down regulate the basal expression of fibrosis related genes in fibroblasts, invoking a role for epithelial secretome in regulating the fibrosis progression. Our data highlighted the importance of TGF-β’s influence on fibroblast response in OSF, but the mechanism for the regulation of this cytokine was not known. Areca nut did not induce TGF-β ligands in fibroblast as discussed above, but previous data from our group had reported <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> mediated up regulation of TGF-β 2 in epithelial cells. Therefore, we further elucidated the mechanistic details for this induction using immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT and HPL 1 D) and correlated these in OSF tissues. The kinetics of the induction of TGF-β signaling by <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> (5 µg/ml) in epithelial cells was established. Areca nut induced TGF-β 2 transcript, protein and activated the canonical signaling (pSMAD 2 / 3) at 2 hours post treatment, which persisted till 24 hours. The regulation of TGF-β 2 mRNA at 2 hours was dependent on active transcription but was independent of protein translation whereas the activation of signaling (pSMAD 2) required both transcription and translation at this time point. This warranted probing for the role of TβR-I in the activation of TGF-β signal by <b>areca</b> <b>nut.</b> A small molecule inhibitor was used to abrogate the kinase activity of TβR-I. Areca nut induced TGF-β 2 mRNA at 2 hours even in the presence of TβR-I inhibitor whereas the induction was compromised at 24 hours although the activation of SMAD 2 at both 2 and 24 hours was compromised in the presence of TβR-I. This result signified that induction of TGF-β signaling was dependent on the TβR-I activity at early and late time points, but the transcription of the ligand was independent of the receptor activity at early time point. These results indicated the activation of some other pathway by <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> which could regulate the transcription of TGF-β 2 and thereby activate TGF-β signaling in epithelial cells. To explore this possibility, a panel of pathway inhibitors was used and only JNK inhibitor compromised <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> induced TGF-β 2 mRNA and pSMAD 2. The results were corroborated by transient knockdown of JNK 1 and JNK 2. Further, JNK was phosphorylated at 30 minutes to 2 hours by <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> treatment on epithelial cells. This activation was found to be independent of TβR-I activity. In good correlation, activated JNK 1 / 2 was also detected in OSF tissues and was not detectable in normal tissues. Since JNK activation was found to be a pre-requisite for <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> induced TGF-β signal activation; we further explored the mechanism of JNK activation by <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> itself. Areca nut mediated activation of JNK was found to be dependent on muscarinic acid receptor, Ca 2 +/CAMKII and ROS. Inhibition of these significantly compromised <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> induced pJNK. In line with this, inhibition of muscarinic acid receptor activity, CAMKII and ROS also abrogated <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> mediated induction of TGF-β 2 mRNA and pSMAD 2. The regulation of TGF-β signaling by <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> in epithelial cells was dependent on transcription, and JNK activity was essential for this. We further sought to explore transcription factors which were regulated by JNK and therefore could possibly induce TGF-β 2 promoter activity. ATF 2 and c-Jun transcription factors were found to be induced at 30 minutes by <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> and this up regulation also persisted till 24 hours. Further, activation of both ATF 2 and c-Jun was dependent on JNK but independent of TβR-I activity. Moreover, <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> treatment induced translocation of these phoshorylated transcription factors in the nucleus of epithelial cells. Additionally, pATF 2 and p-c-Jun were enriched on TGF-β 2 promoter after 2 hours of treatment by <b>areca</b> <b>nut.</b> To investigate the importance of this enrichment and regulation of TGF-β signal activation by <b>areca</b> <b>nut,</b> we transiently knocked down these proteins and studied the regulation of TGF-β 2. Areca nut induced TGF-β 2 mRNA and pSMAD 2 was abrogated upon ATF 2 and c-Jun knockdown, implicating JNK mediated activation of ATF 2 and c-Jun in <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> induced TGF- β	signaling. To explore the significance of this mechanism in OSF, immunohistochemical staining for pATF 2 and p-c-Jun was performed on OSF and normal tissues. Both the transcription factors were found in the nuclei of OSF tissues whereas their expression was not detected in normal tissues. This expression also correlated with the previously reported activation of SMAD 2 in OSF tissues by our group. Hence, ATF 2 and c-Jun were observed to be important in <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> mediated TGF-β signaling in OSF. In conclusion, the work described in this thesis provides mechanistic details into OSF etiopathogenesis. Combined actions of <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> and TGF-β induced a response in fibroblasts akin to OSF. Our results advocate a role for epithelial secreted factors in influencing fibroblast response in both normal and disease (OSF) conditions. Further, importance of TGF-β in OSF has been elucidated in terms of enhancing the fibroblast response to <b>areca</b> <b>nut.</b> We have also elucidated the mechanism for <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> mediated activation of TGF-β signaling and have identified the contribution of JNK/ATF 2 /Jun axis in this process. This work can impact the management of oral submucous fibrosis by providing newer targets for treatment...|$|R
40|$|Background: Areca nut, {{the seed}} of fruit of an oriental palm, known as Areca catechu, is {{commonly}} chewed in many countries. Diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, oropharyngeal and oesophageal cancers {{have been associated with}} <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> chewing and the mechanism by which <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> chewing increases the risk of systemic diseases remains elusive. We hypothesize that systemic inflammation may be elevated among <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> users, which is linked with many systemic diseases. Therefore, this present study was conducted to examine the systemic inflammation among <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> chewers and healthy controls. Methods: This was an observational cross sectional study carried out on <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> chewers and healthy individuals in Karachi, Pakistan. Participants were selected from a region of the city by invitation request sent from door to door. Information was collected regarding the socio-demographic profile and the pattern of use, and a blood sample was obtained to measure the level of C-reactive protein (CRP). We carried out multiple logistic regressions to investigate the association between socio-demographic profile, <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> chewing and CRP levels. Results: We carried out final analysis on 1112 individuals of which 556 were <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> chewers and 556 were the age, gender and area matched controls. Areca nut chewers had a significantly higher proportion of men (15. 1 %, n = 84) who had an elevated CRP (> 10 mg/dl) as compared to controls (5. 2 %, n = 29). Multivariate analyses showed that <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> chewers had significantly higher odds of an elevated CRP (OR = 3. 23, 95 % CI 2. 08 - 5. 02, p value Conclusions: Areca nut chewing has a significant association with systemic inflammation. Further work is required to confirm that systemic inflammation is the main pathway by which <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> use increases the risk of systemic diseases...|$|R
40|$|Oral submucous {{fibrosis}} (OSF) is {{a chronic}} inflammatory disease {{characterized by the}} accumulation of excess collagen, and <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> chewing has been proposed as an important etiological factor for disease manifestation. Activation of transforming growth factor-b signaling has been postulated as the main causative event for increased collagen production in OSF. Oral epithelium plays important roles in OSF, and arecoline {{has been shown to}} induce TGF-b in epithelial cells. In an attempt to understand the role of <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> constituents in the manifestation of OSF, we studied the global gene expression profile in epithelial cells (HaCaT) following treatment with <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> water extract or TGF-b. Interestingly, 64 % of the differentially regulated genes by <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> water extract matches with the TGF-b induced gene expression profile. Out of these, expression of 57 % of genes was compromised in the presence of ALK 5 (TbRI) inhibitor and 7 % were independently induced by <b>areca</b> <b>nut,</b> highlighting the importance of TGF-b in <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> actions. Areca nut water extract treatment induced p-SMAD 2 and TGF-b downstream targets in HaCaT cells but not in human gingival fibroblast cells (hGF), suggesting epithelial cells could be the source of TGF-b in promoting OSF. Water extract of <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> consists of polyphenols and alkaloids. Both polyphenol and alkaloid fractions of <b>areca</b> <b>nut</b> were able to induce TGF-b signaling and its downstream targets. Also, SMAD- 2 was phosphorylated following treatment of HaCaT cells by Catechin, Tannin and alkaloids namely Arecoline, Arecaidine and Guvacine. Moreover, both polyphenols and alkaloids induced TGF-b 2 and THBS 1 (activator o...|$|R
