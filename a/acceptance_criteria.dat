There are considerable amounts of research and publications that are able to well demonstrate the unreliability of relative density as an <b>acceptance</b> <b>criterion.</b> Relative density has no real influence on the soil's performance, its range of application does not span across all soil types, and it is subject to large inherent errors that make its use a technical risk.

We present a Variable Neighbourhood Monte Carlo Search (VNMS), which employs variable neighbourhood search with an Exponential Monte Carlo <b>acceptance</b> <b>criterion.</b> VNMS is a descent-ascent heuristic that operates on three sets of neighbourhood structures {{that are based on}} three different local searchers. The first two sets use a steepest descent and Exponential Monte Carlo local search, respectively whilst the third set uses a random 3 -opt operator. The solution returned by a local search, after exploring a neighbourhood structure, will be accepted based on the EMCQ (Exponential Monte Carlo with counter) <b>acceptance</b> <b>criterion.</b> The novelty of the VNMS approach (in the context of VNS) is the concept of three stages of neighbourhood search, using an EMCQ <b>acceptance</b> <b>criterion</b> (at the VNS level) and the shaking procedure (which is only applied when the local searchers cannot find an improved solution).

2500|$|Despite all setbacks, Siemens-Schuckert {{still wanted}} to sell the aircraft, and {{commenced}} another rebuild. The nose was redesigned again, into a rounded, blunt configuration with a gun position atop.

By now, the aircraft had acquired the nickname Ladenhüter (literally, [...] "shelf warmer" [...] or, idiomatically, [...] "white elephant") and pilots refused to fly it. Siemens-Schuckert director Walter Reichel negotiated a price discount for the Idflieg if they would accept the aircraft to a lower specification.

2500|$|Even {{with these}} {{modifications}} in place, the Forssman could not fulfil the Idfliegs <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria,</b> and Villehad Forssman severed his connections with Siemens-Schuckert {{owing to the}} failure of his design. With Siemens-Schuckert still eager to recoup its investment in the design, the firm assigned Harald Wolff to improve the aircraft. Wolff deleted the tacked-on pulpit from the nose and redesigned the forward fuselage to taper to a sharp point, surmounted by a teardrop-shaped cupola for the pilot. The redesign also replaced the two inner D.III engines with more powerful Mercedes D.IVa engines mounted on faired struts. [...] The outer engines remained unchanged, but were moved from their original position to mountings on faired struts midway in the interplane gap, to improve propeller efficiency. Gun positions were added in the nose and in dorsal and ventral locations in the fuselage, although all these positions remained faired-over during testing and {{there is no evidence that}} armament was ever fitted. In September 1915, and after another pilot had refused to fly the aircraft following some ground tests, Lt Walter Höndorf agreed to test the redesigned Forssman. After a one or two hops, the aircraft turned over on its nose while alighting. The nose was crushed, and the leading-edge spar in the upper wing was fractured.|$|E

40|$|The {{high-strength}} alloys used in {{the aerospace}} industry for rotating parts are inspected ultrasonically for material anomalies which may have resulted from the manufacturing process. These materials, such as titanium alloys, often have a large macro-grain structure which limits {{the sensitivity of the}} ultrasonic inspection to material anomalies. An improved inspection for cylindrical titanium alloy billet was implemented in production in 1995. This inspection, also called the multizone inspection, utilizes bicylindrically focused transducers to inspect the billet using multiple zones. It also features digital C-scan image acquisition and a dual <b>acceptance</b> <b>criterion</b> based on both amplitude relative to a 2 / 64 ″ flat-bottom hole (FBH) calibration target and C-scan signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). [1] The SNR was calculated manually by the operators using graphical user interface based image analysis software. The SNR-based criterion {{has proved to be a}} more effective detector of material anomalies than the amplitude criterion. [2] It is, however, susceptible to operator variability. The operator variability was leading to a larger than expected number of false positive indications during production inspections. A false positive indication is one which did not meet the <b>acceptance</b> <b>criterion</b> of the test, but no corresponding material anomaly was found on metalography. To resolve this problem, a dynamic threshold algorithm for ultrasonic C-scan images is applied to the images to automatically identify indications which exceed either the amplitude or the SNR <b>acceptance</b> <b>criterion...</b>|$|R

30|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{introduced}} the orienteering problem with soft time windows (OPSTW). This routing problem {{can serve as}} a model for many practical applications for which travel times cannot be accurately known or when hard time windows are not required. Computational results on OPSTW show that our hybrid algorithm is able to achieve solutions that increase the total collected profit without hurting customers’ satisfaction significantly. On OPTW test instances our hybrid algorithm is able to achieve promising solutions. In our test experiments, instances with tight time windows are solved better than that with broader time windows. A 2 -Opt or 3 -Opt procedure may reduce this gap by decreasing the time duration of the route and inserting other possible unrouted customers. Since the chosen <b>acceptance</b> <b>criterion</b> has a critical influence on the balance between intensification and diversification of the search, a possible improvement of the algorithm could involve also considering worst solutions during the search. One could work with a simulated annealing <b>acceptance</b> <b>criterion.</b>|$|R

An ideal <b>acceptance</b> <b>criterion</b> for the evaluator balances the goals of incentive provision and project selection. Relative to this, informed review results in an excessively steep equilibrium acceptance policy: the standard applied to low-ability agents is too stringent and the standard applied to high ability agents is too lenient. Blind review in which all types face the same standard often provides better incentives, but it ignores valuable information for selecting projects. In general, the evaluator prefers a policy of blind (resp. informed) review when the ability distribution is sufficiently skewed toward high (resp. low) types or the agent’s payoff from acceptance is sufficiently high (resp. low) ...|$|R
