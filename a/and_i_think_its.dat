40|$|Credit from stored grain Cue: Farmers {{are often}} {{forced to sell}} their crops when prices are low, because they need money quickly. One way to get better prices {{is known as the}} {{warehouse}} receipt system. Under this system, farmers are able to deposit their harvested maize in a warehouse and be given a receipt which states the amount {{and the quality of the}} grain they have stored. The farmer can then, if they wish, give this receipt to a bank in order to obtain a loan, enabling them to buy inputs for the new season or pay for other items. Later in the season when grain prices should have risen, the farmer can sell the stored maize, repay the loan and hopefully have some money left over. So in Zambia, a few years ago the Zambia Agricultural Commodity Agency tried to set up a warehouse receipt system. But it failed. So why did a system that sounded so good for commercial farmers not deliver better profits? To find out, Chris Kakunta spoke to Rob Munro, a marketing adviser for USAID, which helped to set up the pilot project. IN:	?Essentially it was a very donor-driven ? OUT:	?a commercial commodities market. ? DUR?N:	 3 ? 00 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Rob Munro of USAID in Zambia, on some of the challenges connected with the warehouse receipt system, in providing credit to smallholder farmers. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Munro	Essentially it was a very donor-driven entity, in that the commodity traders and the banks never really bought into the concept of warehouse receipts. Kakunta	And that led to it failing? Munro	Essentially yes. But I think one of the key problems here, and this will bring us on to lessons which we?ve learnt from that experience, is that a warehouse receipt system depends on the existence of a functioning, high volume commodities market. If you look at this year in particular, there is very little maize stored in warehouses. There is very little maize in total, from this particular harvest and there is no incentive for farmers to be depositing crop into a warehouse, looking for higher prices further into the year. Kakunta	If we have to really look at the system itself, does it really work? Munro	I think the answer to that is yes. It requires the presence of a very strong commodities market where there is plenty of supply, ample demand, multiple buyers and also, critically, a credible pricing system. Kakunta	What is the way forward in terms of warehouse receipt system here in Zambia? Munro	I think it?s important to realise that from a smallholder?s point of view, a warehouse receipt is not the answer to all his or her marketing problems. I think where the primary value of it lies is that by putting commodity into a secure storage at grades and standards in terms of quality and quantity which are recognised by the industry, that warehouse receipt becomes a very valuable trading tool. So I think that?s its primary use as a trading tool, allowing small, relatively small parcels of crop to be aggregated into a large parcel which is then accessible by commercial markets. Secondary to that is a financing option. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it?s</b> important to realise that the cost of finance is very high. You need to be very sure, if you are looking for finance from a warehouse receipt, you need to be very sure that the gains in price which you are hoping to take advantage of later on in the season are significantly more than your costs of finance. There have been examples in Zambia, one in particular I?m thinking of, where a crop was deposited at the beginning of the marketing season, held onto until later on in the year, and by the time that crop was released from the warehouse it was actually worth less than the combination of its underlying price and the price of storage and finance. So it?s a risky? like any financing, like any market speculation, it?s a risky business. And therefore it?s not the answer for all smallholders. But I think, like I said, more importantly it?s a valuable tool for bringing your crop into a commercial commodities market. End of track. Zambia?s experience with the warehouse receipt system, whereby farmers can borrow money using stored grain as collateral...|$|E

For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable.

It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|R
60|$|The {{principal}} talk during supper (which {{consisted of}} Welsh-rabbit and biscuits, with champagne and sodawater) {{was about the}} Times, and the two contributors expressed vast admiration of Mr. ------, who has the chief editorial management of the paper. It is odd to find how little we outsiders know of men who really exercise a vast influence on affairs, for this Mr. ------ is certainly of far more importance {{in the world than}} a minister of state. He writes nothing himself; but the character of the Times seems to depend upon his intuitive, unerring judgment; and if ever he is absent from his post, even for a day or two, they say that the paper immediately shows it. In reply to my questions, they appeared to acknowledge that {{he was a man of}} expediency, but of a very high expediency, and that he gave the public the very best principles which it was capable of receiving. Perhaps it may be so: the Times's articles are certainly not written in so high a moral vein as might be wished; but what they lack in height they gain in breadth. Every sensible man in England finds his own best common-sense there; <b>and,</b> in effect, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>its</b> influence is wholesome.|$|R
60|$|In the {{description}} of the Fig-tree angle, given in the eighth chapter of Vol. II., I said that it seemed to me somewhat earlier than that of the Vine, and the reader might be surprised at the apparent opposition of this statement to my supposition that the Palace was built gradually round from the Rio FaÃ§ade to the Piazzetta. But in the two great open arcades there is no succession of work traceable; from the Vine angle to the junction with the fifteenth century work, above and below, all seems nearly of the same date, the only question being of the accidental precedence of workmanship of one capital or another; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> from <b>its</b> style, that the Fig-tree angle must have been first completed. But in the upper stories of the Palace there are enormous differences of style. On the Rio FaÃ§ade, in the upper story, are several series of massive windows of the third order, corresponding exactly in mouldings and manner of workmanship to those of the chapter-house of the Frari, and consequently carrying us back to a very early date in the fourteenth century: several of the capitals of these windows, and two richly sculptured string-courses in the wall below, are of Byzantine workmanship, and in all probability fragments of the Ziani Palace. The traceried windows on the Rio FaÃ§ade, and the two eastern windows on the Sea FaÃ§ade, are all of the finest early fourteenth century work, masculine and noble in their capitals and bases to the highest degree, and evidently contemporary with the very earliest portions of the lower arcades. But the moment we come to the windows of the Great Council Chamber the style is debased. The mouldings are the same, but they are coarsely worked, and the heads set amidst the leafage of the capitals quite valueless and vile.|$|R
