2500|$|The 1966 Doctor's Charter {{introduced}} <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> <b>rent</b> and ancillary staff, {{significantly increased}} the pay scales, {{and changed the}} structure of payments to reflect [...] "both qualifications of doctors and the form of their practices, i.e. group practice." [...] These changes not only led to higher morale, but also resulted in {{the increased use of}} ancillary staff and nursing attachments, a {{growth in the number of}} health centres and group practices, and a boost in the modernisation of practices in terms of equipment, appointment systems, and buildings. The charter introduced a new system of payment for GPs, with refunds <b>for</b> surgery, <b>rents,</b> and rates, to ensure that the costs of improving his surgery did not diminish the doctor's income, together with <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> the greater part of ancillary staff costs. In addition, a Royal Commission on medical education was set up, partly to draw up ideas for training GPS (since these doctors, the largest group of all doctors in the country, had previously not received any special training, [...] "merely being those who, at the end of their pre-doctoral courses, did not go on for further training in any speciality).|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on the actual issue of rent deregulation in the Czech Republic. The first part is dedicated to the economic theory of housing demand, housing supply and price control. Afterwards is analyzed the rental sector, focusing on the rent control from its beginning to the present. In the third part is discussed the process of deregulation, regarding the development of deregulation in our country and also the system of rent comparisons. The final part is concerned to the development of housing benefit in our country and is compared with the addressed rent allowance / housing, which is applied in the most of European countries. The main purpose of the thesis is to assess the current situation on the housing market and the economic and social effects of rent deregulation. The partial purpose is to find the appropriateness of implementation of the addressable <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the <b>rent</b> / housing...|$|R

40|$|This article employs {{administrative}} data on claimants of <b>rent</b> supplement—theprincipal housing <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> private <b>renting</b> {{households in the}} Republic of Ireland—toexamine spatial variations {{in the numbers of}} claimants, the cost of this benefit and the characteristicsof claimant households both within and between different regions. It reveals that thesespatial variations illuminate some {{of the reasons for the}} unexpectedly high growth in both thenumbers of claimants and the cost of rent supplement over the last decade. This geographicalanalysis casts doubts on several of the key supposed benefits of using housing allowances,rather than capital grant aid for social housing provision, to cater for the accommodationneeds of low-income households. It reveals that, due to uneven claimant geography, the costsof the former are just as difficult to control as the latter. Moreover, housing allowances do notnecessarily afford claimants greater consumer choice. As a result of funding constraints anddiscrimination by landlords their locational choices are severely constrained which in turnmeans that the socio-spatial segregation associated with housing allowances is as significantas that effected by social housing provision...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} also {{available}} online at: [URL] part of its reform of Housing Benefit, the Government has introduced a Local Housing <b>Allowance</b> (LHA) <b>for</b> private <b>rented</b> sector claimants in nine Pathfinder areas. This report gives early findings from the claimant stream of the evaluation of LHA and covers the period up to around {{six months after the}} start of LHA in each Pathfinder. It is important to stress that these are early, emerging findings. Many claimants will only just have gone onto LHA or received direct payment for the first time, so the behavioural impacts of LHA are unlikely to have fed through as yet. These will be monitored throughout the evaluation period to assess any future changes and so these findings may develop over time...|$|R

40|$|The {{government}} {{plans to}} introduce a radical reform of Housing Benefit for private tenants. Known as the Local Housing Allowance (LHA), the new scheme has been piloted over a two year period prior to a planned national roll-out. The radical feature of the LHA is that, unlike the present Housing Benefit (HB) scheme, entitlement is no longer based on the tenant's rent. Instead, within each local market area, there is a flat-rate <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> all privately <b>rented</b> claimants, which varies only by household size and composition. Yet most of the controversy has focused, not {{on the design of}} the flat-rate allowance, but on the associated proposal to pay it to claimants rather than to their landlords. Local authorities will only be able to pay the LHA to the landlord if they consider that the tenant is 'vulnerable' and incapable of managing their financial affairs, is unlikely to pay their rent or has accrued eight weeks' rent arrears. This report examines HB claimants' understanding, attitudes and experiences of the two different payment methods, that is, payment to the claimant and payment to the landlord. It explores this issue in the context of claimants' attitudes towards their liability to pay the rent and how rent payment fits into their household budgeting more generally...|$|R

30|$|Third, auctions {{should be}} {{introduced}} into the <b>allowance</b> allocation <b>for</b> takers. In China, Guangdong is the first and currently the only pilot province to introduce auctions into the allowance allocation. After the first pilot year (July 2013 –July 2014), the compliance rate of enterprises and the allowance on CO 2 emissions reduction achieved 98.90 and 99.97  %, respectively. In the Guangdong industrial sectors, the enterprises must acquire a 3  % allowance through auction, and they can then activate a 97  % <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> free; for large public buildings, 100  % are allocated for free by benchmarking before the compliance period. At present, the government-allocated <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the enterprises is free in Beijing. However, the CET will eventually be completely adjusted by the market, {{as is the case}} for CET in the EU (European Union). Specifically, a certain level of auction, such as 3  %, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the takers; and a lesser amount for auction, which should be smaller than the proportion of auction in the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the takers, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the givers; alternatively, 100  % can be free <b>for</b> the <b>allowance</b> of the givers.|$|R
