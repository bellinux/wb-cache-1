5|$|Besides {{religious}} imagery, the frescoes of the Donja Kamenica church {{also include}} eleven portraits of contemporary historical figures, separated into four compositions. Three of the compositions are uncaptioned, making {{the identification of}} the people practically impossible. The first composition is located in the cella and depicts two men preserved from the waist up, of which one holds a model of the church, and a child, of which only the head is visible today. The second composition was painted on the upper west wall of the narthex and portrays <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>a</b> woman, a boy and a girl, with the man also holding a model of the church, a common symbol of donorship. Art historian Dragana Frfulanović believes that the images of men holding models in both compositions depict the same person, the main donor. The third composition is in the cella and depicts two men: a monk and a priest.|$|E

25|$|For {{the third}} person pronouns, Mixtec has several pronouns that {{indicate}} whether the referent is <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>a</b> woman, an animal, a child or an inanimate object, a sacred or divine entity, or water. Some languages have respect forms for {{the man and woman}} pronouns. Some languages have other pronouns as well (such as for trees.) (These pronouns show some etymological affinity to nouns for 'man', 'woman', 'tree', etc., but they are distinct from those nouns.) These may be pluralized (in some varieties, if one wishes to be explicit) by using the common plural marker de in front of them, or by using explicit plural forms that have evolved.|$|E

25|$|Inspired by the {{contemporary}} liberal movements in Europe, {{as a writer}} and a public figure, Chavchavadze directed much of his efforts toward awakening national ideals in Georgians and {{to the creation of a}} stable society in his homeland. His most important literary works were: The Hermit, The Ghost, Otaraant Widow, Kako The Robber, Happy Nation, Latters of a Traveller and Is <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>a</b> human?!. He was editor-in-chief of the periodicals Sakartvelos Moambe (1863–77) and Iveria (1877–1905), and authored numerous articles for journals. He was a devoted protector of the Georgian language and culture from Russification. He is considered the main contributor of Georgian cultural nationalism. The three main ethnic markers of Georgian identity, according to Chavchavadze, consisted of territory, language, and Christianity. Despite this, his nationalism was secular.|$|E
25|$|To be an enlisted woman {{during the}} {{creation}} stages was not easy. Besides {{the fact that}} everyone was learning as they went, they did not receive the support they needed from the male recruits. Women were initially paid two-thirds of what {{a man at the}} same level made. As the war progressed the military leaders began to see the substantial impact the women could make. In many cases the women had outperformed their male counterparts. This was taken into account and the women received a raise to four-fifths of the wages of <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> <b>A</b> female doctor however, received equal financial compensation to her male counterpart. One commander argued that it would be impossible for female recruits to reach the location of his station, even though it was located only three and a half miles from the city and was serviced by a paved road and a bus route The negative reaction of men towards the female recruits was addressed in propaganda films. Proudly She Marches and Wings on Her Shoulder were made to show the acceptance of female recruits, while showing the men that although they were taking jobs traditionally intended for men, {{they would be able to}} retain their femininity.|$|E

500|$|The {{introduction}} of the potato {{in the second half}} of the 16th century heavily influenced cuisine thereafter. Great poverty encouraged a subsistence approach to food and by the mid-19th century the vast majority of the population sufficed with a diet of potatoes and milk. A typical family, consisting of <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>a</b> woman and four children, would eat [...] of potatoes a week. Consequently, dishes that are considered as national dishes represent a fundamental unsophistication to cooking, such as the Irish stew, bacon and cabbage, boxty, a type of potato pancake, or colcannon, a dish of mashed potatoes and kale or cabbage.|$|E
500|$|Since García Márquez's {{parents were}} more or less strangers to him for {{the first few years of}} his life, his {{grandparents}} influenced his early development very strongly. His grandfather, whom he called [...] "Papalelo", was a Liberal veteran of the Thousand Days War. The Colonel was considered a hero by Colombian Liberals and was highly respected. He was well known for his refusal to remain silent about the banana massacres that took place the year after García Márquez was born. The Colonel, whom García Márquez described as his [...] "umbilical cord with history and reality," [...] was also an excellent storyteller. He taught García Márquez lessons from the dictionary, took him to the circus each year, and was the first to introduce his grandson to ice—a [...] "miracle" [...] found at the United Fruit Company store.

[...] Ned Stark teaches all his children about leadership, selflessness, duty and honor. Following his father's example becomes more difficult as Jon faces challenges to his identity as <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>a</b> Stark, and a brother of the Night's Watch. Benioff and Weiss note that [...] "Jon Snow tries to live with honor, while knowing that honor often gets his family members murdered." [...] Writing for Variety about the season 6 episode [...] "Battle of the Bastards", Laura Prudom suggests that Jon [...] "has the same shortcomings" [...] as his father: [...] "he fights with honor against opponents who are all too willing to use that predictable morality against him".|$|E

Sonia Murray of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution hailed it as the band's most effectual and multifaceted record yet, while Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot said [...] "they find rapture that is steeped in reality rather than in the upwardly mobile fantasy concocted by many of today's less tradition-conscious R crooners." [...] "The Tonies serve as a sort of stylistic missing link", J. D. Considine wrote in The Baltimore Sun, [...] "suggesting what would have happened had the soul styles of the '70s continued to evolve, instead of being tossed aside by the synth-driven sound of the '80s". Michael A. Gonzales from Vibe said the album [...] "glows a vision of blackness that is superbad, mad smooth, and crazy sexy". He described it as [...] "a wonderland of harmonic delights, softcore jollies, and slow-jam fever floating on the tip of Cupid's arrow", showing the group [...] "exploring the sensuality of black pop without sounding like boulevard bullies stalking their objects of desire". House of Music finished 30th in The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop poll, which ranked the year's best albums as voted on by 236 American critics nationwide.
