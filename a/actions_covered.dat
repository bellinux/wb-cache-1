Beginning in the late 1980s, Jean-Louis Laville and Frank Moulaert researched social innovation. In Canada CRISES initiated this type of research. Another, larger project was SINGOCOM a European Commission Framework 5 project, which pioneered so-called [...] "Alternative Models for Local Innovation" [...] (ALMOLIN). These models were further elaborated through community <b>actions</b> <b>covered</b> by KATARSIS and SOCIAL POLIS. More recent works focus on the societal role of the economic life in terms of innovations in social practices and social relations at the local and regional levels.

This is {{in addition to a}} variety of other initiatives and programs that targeted employment, entrepreneurship, training and education. Hence, it was necessary to establish a comprehensive institution that embraces all of those initiatives and programs and aims at providing humanitarian services to the community: Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd Bin Abdulaziz Foundation for Humanitarian Development was established. The Foundation aims at finding innovative solutions to humanitarian problems. Its programs intend to identify the nature of these problems while determining convenient solutions and ways of their application within the targeted communities.

40|$|This Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) {{contains}} {{an assessment of}} the potential environmental impacts of the construction and operation of an Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) for the Three Mile Island Unit 2 (TMI- 2) fuel debris at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental laboratory (INEEL). US Department of Energy-Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID) is proposing to design, construct, and operate at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP). The TMI- 2 fuel debris would be removed from wet storage, transported to the ISFSI, and placed in storage modules on a concrete basemat. As part of its overall spent nuclear fuel (SNF) management program, the US DOE has prepared a final programmatic environmental impact statement (EIS) that provides an overview of the spent fuel management proposed for INEEL, including the construction and operation of the TMI- 2 ISFSI. In addition, DOE-ID has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) to describe the environmental impacts associated with the stabilization of the storage pool and the construction/operation of the ISFSI at the ICPP.

40|$|This paper restricts {{itself to}} crimes {{involving}} corporate fiduciaries taking bad decisions {{at the expense}} of shareholders (corporate governance offenses). The arguments do not apply to fraud as moral wrongfulness exists in that case. To the extent that the <b>actions</b> <b>covered</b> by this paper are blameworthy, I argue that this determination must be disentangled from punishment. Disentanglement of blame from deserts suggests a via-media between criminalization and decriminalization - criminalization without incarceration. Accordingly, the legal process stops at the determination of guilt. The paper advances the criminalization debate because it does not get bogged down in the irreconcilable quarrel about whether corporate governance misbehavior ought to be criminalized for deterrence, retribution, or rehabilitation reasons, and whether it achieves any of these purposes. For these offenses, I argue that whichever theoretical justification underpins the decision to criminalize, imprisonment must not follow conviction. The conviction, despite the lack of incarceration, and the consequential sanctions likely to be imposed on the wrongdoer are sufficient to satisfy the three main justifications for criminalization. In appropriate cases, disgorgement of the offender’s gains will aid in the achievement of these objectives. The model proposed by this paper would yield significant savings by reducing prison costs. It would also allow the state {{to take advantage of the}} disproportionate cost/burden of conviction on corporate governance offenders. Owing to the offenders’ high earning potential, deterrence can be achieved at lower cost by conviction alone because the cost of incarceration does not have to be borne by the state whereas the destruction of capacity to generate similar (or indeed, any) income has to be suffered by the offender even without going to jail. If the cost of incarceration is the same for offenders with different earning capacities, imprisoning those with very high earning capacities is a waste of social capital if the objectives sought to be achieved by incarceration can be achieved through other means. Further, the cost of a conviction can be predicted with sufficient certainty in the case of white-collar criminals by looking at their earnings history, and in many cases this can be a significant sum. Unlike the common criminal who may not have a similarly predictable earning capacity and therefore suffer the same extent of monetary loss from a conviction, this loss ought to serve the deterrence function without the need for the state to spend money imprisoning the offender. In addition to loss of earning capacity, clawing back ill-gotten gains significantly adds to disutility. The paper is set out as follows: Part II briefly outlines the scope of the wrongs tackled as stemming from the principal-agent relationship in corporate law, and the inability of the law to overcome effectively problems resulting from the collectivization of the principal in that relationship. In Part III, I argue that conviction without imprisonment is a second-best alternative to decriminalization in cases where the conduct is blameworthy, and results in non-consensual harm. Part IV demonstrates the disutility caused by conviction alone to show that the objectives of criminalization can be satisfied without the need for imprisonment. Part V asserts that consequential sanctions like shaming add to the disutility of conviction. Part VI ties the thesis to Skilling’s conviction for bad business judgment devoid of moral wrongfulness to illustrate the problems with conflating blame and punishment. Part VII concludes...|$|E

This paper {{discusses}} arbitrability of {{a lawsuit}} initiated by an action to declare {{a resolution of the}} general meeting of a public limited company null and void. The paper starts by presenting the relevant provisions of the Croatian Companies Act, as well as the present case law of the High Commercial Court that considers such nullity <b>actions</b> <b>covered</b> by exclusive jurisdiction of territorially competent commercial courts. The author suggests a change in the view in favour of the arbitrability of such disputes. After considering present normative obstacles to arbitrability, the author proposes an amendment to Art 3 para 1 of the Croatian Law on Arbitration to clarify that nullity actions at stake are indeed arbitrable. In {{the second part of the}} paper, the author analyses the main features of nullity actions against resolutions of general company meetings. First, the parties in dispute are considered, in particular possible claimants according to the Croatian Companies Act. Under specific conditions provided in that Act, not only natural and legal persons are authorised to launch this action, but the right to sue is also given to the management (managing board) of the company. The respondent is always the public limited company whose general meeting passed the resolution in question. While considering the rules on parties 2 ̆ 7 representation in court, special attention is paid to the possible conflict of interest between the parties 2 ̆ 7 representatives when respondent 2 ̆ 7 s management or managing board (or someone of its members) is a claimant. The prayer for relief is also discussed. It is pointed out that the wording of the prayer for relief is the same one when an action has been lodged on the ground of nullity or of voidance of the general meeting 2 ̆ 7 s resolution. In spite of this there is a difference between the legal nature of the raised claims. The first one is of declaratory nature, while the second has constituent nature. From the requirements provided in the Croatian Companies Act on which both actions are grounded, it may be concluded that the voidance of the resolution is treated as a rule and the cases of its nullity are strictly exceptional. Liberal interpretation of nullity grounds is not allowed. In spite of this difference, the change of arguments from voidance to nullity and vice versa does not require a change in the prayer for relief as the court has to find ex officio the legal consequences of the established facts. Regarding the burden of proof, it is stated that the claimant has to prove its authorization to raise the claim as well as the facts in dispute on which its prayer for relief is grounded. The respondent has to prove that procedural errors in the process of passing the resolution in question have not caused substantial irregularity of the regulation. A resolution of the general meeting may under certain conditions be entered into the company register in spite of the fact that a dispute on its validity is pending. The paper concludes by presenting these conditions, as well as the rationale of this option in the Croatian Companies Act. The consequences of entering such a resolution into the registers held by the courts are considered. In particular, the author highlights the need to change the prayer for relief after entering the decision into register, the proper way of doing it, as well as the consequences that will follow if the claimant fails to amend his claim...|$|E
