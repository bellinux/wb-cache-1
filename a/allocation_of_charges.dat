40|$|Securing {{the supply}} of {{electricity}} to a region of a power system requires either generation capacity within that region, or transmission import capability coupled with generation elsewhere in the power system. The problem is one of co-optimising generation and transmission infrastructure. This paper begins by discussing changes in Great Britain (GB) regulator environment affecting the provision of regional security of supply: changes to the transmission charging regime; new regulatory arrangements including enhancements to the System Operator’s role, and the opening up of major new transmission projects to competition; and some limitations of the existing standard defining the methodology for calculating secure transmission capabilities. Scotland, as a region of the GB power system, provides an interesting case study in which to investigate the allocation of contributions to regional security of supply between transmission and various categories of generation. In particular, intermittent generation is currently ignored when calculating the level of transmission import capability required to maintain security of supply in a region, whilst it is considered in overall generation adequacy calculations at a system level. Whilst wind generation is not dispatchable, it is shown here that it does provide an additional source of generation availability {{that should be considered}} in studies into transmission import requirements. This paper uses historical data for Scottish generation availability from recent winters to investigate the likely impact of changes to the Scottish generation fleet on the need for secure transmission import capability into Scotland. It calculates transmission requirements based on the risk of requiring demand reduction within a region. Scenarios representing possible generation backgrounds in Scotland over the coming decade show that, measured in this way, wind generation can offset transmission import requirements by up to 25 % of its installed capacity. The key conclusions of the paper are that a risk-based analysis of regional security of supply and transmission requirements can help allocate the true impact of different generators on the transmission import capability needed to secure supply to a region. Such a method can therefore be useful in informing the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> between parties and in developing planning standards to shape future investment in the system...|$|E

The French Environmental and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) set standards and norms for the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>charging</b> stations while drawing the roadmap to the expansion of these infrastructures.

Regulatory framework and a viable business model to ensure the integration and success of the electric vehicles. This includes a vehicles cost reduction to assure future users of the viability of this technology (recycling battery component).

Achieving a balance between these interactions is a key parameter to be taken into account in the strategy for the deployment <b>of</b> the <b>charging</b> infrastructure. In this report, one of the main points that should be emphasized is the standard that must be applied when designing a charging station infrastructure. Concerning the type of CS, three types of terminals are identified: (i) slow charging points for home or long stay parking charging, (ii) semi-rapid charging points mainly at public park and (iii) fast CS along urban motorways and dense road traffic. The expansion of Electric Vehicles (EV) implies an optimized and cost-effective deployment of CS.

40|$|The {{market share}} of plug-in {{electric}} vehicles (PEVs) has been increasing {{in the last years}} which comes along with a raising demand for public charging stations. While the operation <b>of</b> low-power <b>charging</b> stations (Mode- 3) is far from being profitable, prospects for fast charging stations indicate attractive revenues. This is mainly based on a higher workload (shorter charging times), a higher willingness-to-pay of customers and a higher complementary situation compared to home-based charging [1]. Both also serve for different purposes: Slow charging is performed whenever there is an opportunity while fast charging will also allow short stops to recharge on long-distance trips (interim charging). In this paper, we investigate the potential for combining interim and opportunity charging at one location in order to increase the utilization and decrease the payback time <b>of</b> public fast <b>charging</b> stations.

40|$|Abstract — Large scale {{deployment}} of Plug-in Electric Ve-hicles (PEVs) in the smart grid environment necessitates the use <b>of</b> appropriate <b>charging</b> control algorithms that handle the additional PEV based load effectively. While ensuring grid stability, these PEV charging control algorithms {{must ensure that}} the available energy is delivered to where it is needed the most. In this paper, we explore the question <b>of</b> efficient <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> energy (<b>charging</b> rates and schedules) to PEVs by the aggregator (electricity utility) through an auction mechanism. Recognizing the practical limitations of the Vickrey-Clark-Groves (VCG) mechanism which would be natural to apply in this context, we investigate two practical mechanisms that {{can be viewed as}} extensions of second price auction mechanisms, and have limited message (bid) complexity. In the first mechanism, the multi-level second price (MSP), each PEV agent submits a number of price bids, one for each of a given set of energy levels (energy quantities). In the second mechanism, the progressive second price (PSP), the PEV agents submit a two-dimensional bid indicating the price as well as the desired energy quantity. Taking into account differences across PEV-owners in terms of their willingness-to-pay values and charging time constraints, we analyze the social optimality and incentive compatibility properties of the two auction mechanisms.

40|$|Large {{deployment}} {{and adoption}} of electric {{vehicles in the}} forthcoming years can have significant environmental impact, like mitigation of climate change and reduction of traffic-induced air pollutants. At the same time, it can strain power network operations, demanding effective load management strategies to deal with induced <b>charging</b> demand. One <b>of</b> the biggest challenges is the complexity that electric vehicle (EV) recharging adds to the power system and {{the inability of the}} existing grid to cope with the extra burden. Charging coordination should provide individual EV drivers with their requested energy amount and at the same time, it should optimise the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>charging</b> events in order to avoid disruptions at the electricity distribution level. This problem could be solved with the introduction of an intermediate agent, known as the aggregator or the charging service provider (CSP). Considering out-of-home charging infrastructure, an additional role for the CSP would be to maximise revenue for parking operators. This thesis contributes to the wider literature of electro-mobility and its effects on power networks with the introduction of a choice-based revenue management method. This approach explicitly treats charging demand since it allows the integration of a decentralised control method with a discrete choice model that captures the preferences of EV drivers. The sensitivities to the joint charging/parking attributes that characterise the demand side have been estimated with EV-PLACE, an online administered stated preference survey. The choice-modelling framework assesses simultaneously out-of-home charging behaviour with scheduling and parking decisions. Also, survey participants are presented with objective probabilities for fluctuations in future prices so that their response to dynamic pricing is investigated. Empirical estimates provide insights into the value that individuals place to the various attributes of the services that are offered by the CSP. The optimisation of operations for recharging infrastructure is evaluated with SOCSim, a micro-simulation framework that is based on activity patterns of London residents. Sensitivity analyses are performed to examine the structural properties of the model and its benefits compared to an uncontrolled scenario are highlighted. The application proposed in this research is practice-ready and recommendations are given to CSPs for its full-scale implementation. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|This article investigates {{charging}} {{strategies for}} plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) {{as part of}} the energy system. The objective was to increase the combined all-electric mileage (total distance driven using only the traction batteries in each PHEV) when the total charging power at each workplace is subject to severe limitations imposed by the energy system. In order to allocate this power optimally, different input variables, such as state-of-charge, battery size, travel distance, and parking time, were considered. The required vehicle mobility was generated using a novel agent-based model that describes the spatiotemporal movement of individual PHEVs. The results show that, in the case of Helsinki (Finland), smart control strategies could lead to an increase of over 5 % in the all-electric mileage compared to a no-control strategy. With a high prediction error, or with a particularly small or large battery, the benefits <b>of</b> smart <b>charging</b> fade off. Smart PHEV charging strategies, when applied to the optimal <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> limited <b>charging</b> power between the cars of a vehicle fleet, seem counterintuitively to provide only a modest increase in the all-electric mileage.

The analysis of dependence via copula models has been focussed on the bivariate case mainly. In the vast majority of instances symmetric elliptical copulas are employed to model dependence for severities. This thesis proposes a new methodology to assess, in a multivariate way, the asymmetry and extreme dependence between severities, and to calculate the capital for operational risk. This methodology simultaneously uses (i) several parametric distributions and an alternative mixture distribution (the Lognormal for the body of losses and the generalised Pareto Distribution for the tail) using a technique from extreme value theory, (ii) the multivariate skew t-copula applied for the first time across severities and (iii) Bayesian theory. The former to model severities, I test simultaneously several parametric distributions and the mixture distribution for each business line. This procedure enables me to achieve multiple combinations of the severity distribution and to find which fits most closely. The second to effectively model asymmetry and extreme dependence in high dimensions. The third to estimate the copula model, given the high multivariate component (i. e. eight business lines and seven event types) and the incorporation of mixture distributions it is highly difficult to implement maximum likelihood. Therefore, I use a Bayesian inference framework and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the posterior distribution to estimate and make inferences of the parameters of the skew t-copula model. The research analyses an updated operational loss data set, SAS® Operational Risk Global Data (SAS OpRisk Global Data), to model operational risk at international financial institutions. I then evaluate the impact of this multivariate, asymmetric and extreme dependence on estimating the total regulatory capital, among other established multivariate copulas. My empirical findings are consistent with other studies reporting thin and medium-tailed loss distributions. My approach substantially outperforms symmetric elliptical copulas, demonstrating that modelling dependence via the skew t-copula provides a more efficient <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>charges</b> <b>of</b> up to 56...|$|R
