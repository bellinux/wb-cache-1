In contrast, some defense contractors, law enforcement analysts, and military <b>analysts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> hydrostatic shock is an unimportant factor when selecting cartridges for a particular use because any incapacitating effect it may have on a target is difficult to measure and inconsistent from one individual to the next.

25|$|Although Muslims and Orthodox Christians lived {{together}} in Ethiopia for many centuries, complete religious freedom was formalized only in 1991. Many of the pre-existing issues – {{dominance of the}} state religion to 1974, seizure of the church properties by the Mengistu regime, 1974–91, state-sponsored persecution of non-Orthodox Christians, second-class citizenship accorded to Ethiopian Muslims, landownership problems and similar issues for non-Orthodox believers – have subsided for the most part. There are currently between 12 and 15 million Protestant Christians, {{as well as other}} new non-Orthodox Christians. Clashes have been very rare with the domination of the Orthodox. Most <b>analysts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> since such equality and full religious freedom didn't exist before, the infrequent clashes might occur until the culture of tolerance grows between all old and new religions and denominations.|$|E

2500|$|The KMT {{increased}} its {{majority in the}} Legislative Yuan in the January 2008 legislative elections, while its nominee Ma Ying-jeou {{went on to win}} the presidency in March of the same year, campaigning on a platform of increased economic growth and better ties with the PRC under a policy of [...] "mutual nondenial". Ma took office on 20 May 2008, the same day that President Chen Shui-bian stepped down and was notified by prosecutors of possible corruption charges. Part of the rationale for campaigning for closer economic ties with the PRC stems from the strong economic growth China attained since joining the World Trade Organization.

2500|$|<b>Analysts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> crimes {{committed}} {{during this time}} may not be covered under {{the laws of war}} (jus in bello), which shields soldiery of inferior rank from prosecution for acts committed under military or state orders. Paul H. Lewis, Professor of Political Science at Tulane University, who has written Guerrillas and Generals: The Dirty War in Argentina, is among those who claim otherwise. Terence Roehrig in his The Prosecution of Former Military Leaders in Newly Democratic Nations: The Cases of Argentina, Greece, and South Korea (McFarland & Company, 2001) estimates that of the disappeared, [...] "at least 10,000 were involved in various ways with the guerrillas". Justice Minister Ricardo Gil Lavedra, who formed part of the 1985 tribunal for the Trial of the Juntas, later went on record saying, [...] "I sincerely believe {{that the majority of the}} victims of the illegal repression were guerrilla militants." [...] The Montoneros in a statement issued in 1984 acknowledged having lost 5,000 guerrillas killed, and the Marxist–Leninist People's Revolutionary Army (Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo or ERP) in 2007 admitted the deaths of some 5,000 of their own armed fighters.

2500|$|Decree 900, for the Agrarian Reform in Guatemala {{created the}} {{possibility}} of gaining crops for those field workers who had no land of their own. The effect of this law was similar to what occurred in Europe after the bubonic plague in the Middle Ages: after the plague, which killed one third of Europe's population at the time, the number of landowners decreased, which released many of the terrestrial land, increased supply and lowered land price. At the same time, many farmers also died from the plague, so that the labor force declined; this shift in supply of workers increased wages. The economic effects of the plague {{are very similar to}} those caused by the land reform in Guatemala: During the first harvest after the implementation of the law, the average income of farmers increased from Q225.00/year TO Q700.00/year. Some <b>analysts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> conditions in Guatemala improved after the reform and that there was a [...] "fundamental transformation of agricultural technology {{as a result of the}} decrease labor supply." [...] Rising living standards also happened in Europe in the fifteenth century, while large-scale technological advances occurred.

2500|$|Opposition to {{a would-be}} {{military}} attack on Iran followed several {{claims that the}} United States and/or Israel might carry out such an attack, in relation to claims that Iran may try to produce nuclear weapons.

Noam Chomsky claims that the real reason for a would-be attack would be to [...] "control Middle East energy resources", in particular petroleum. and physicist Jorge Hirsch claims that the real reason is that the US wishes to demonstrate its intent and capability to [...] "use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries". Starting in 2005, these analysts, including Seymour Hersh, former UN weapons of mass destruction inspector in Iraq from 1991 to 1998, Scott Ritter, Joseph Cirincione, director for non-proliferation at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Professor at the University of San Francisco and Middle East editor for the Foreign Policy in Focus, Stephen Zunes claimed that the United States planned a military attack against Iran.

The cause of this was alleged to be Goldman's ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum—a million and a half tons—in network of 27 Metro International warehouses Goldman owns in Detroit, Michigan. To avoid hoarding and price manipulation, the London Metal Exchange requires that [...] "at least 3,000 tons of that metal must be moved out each day".

25|$|In 1998, when Russian Federation {{experienced}} a severe financial crisis, its military expenditure {{in real terms}} reached its lowest point— barely one-quarter of the USSR's in 1991, and two-fifths {{of the level of}} 1992, the first year of Russia's independent existence. However, since the rise to power of Vladimir Putin and the exposure of the poor state of preparedness amongst Russia's armed forces in the Chechen Wars and the 2008 invasion of Georgian territories (e.g., South Ossetia), Russian military spending has rapidly increased, particularly after the 2008 Russian military reform. According to SIPRI, Russian military spending in real terms in 2012 was the highest it has been since Russian Federation's re-emergence as an independent nation, but is still far lower than the estimated military expenditure of the USSR in 1990 - its final full year of existence (US$291 billion at 2012 prices).

2500|$|India {{continues}} to assert its sovereignty or rights {{over the entire}} region of Kashmir, while Pakistan maintains {{that it is a}} disputed territory.

The problem with the proposal is that the population of the Pakistan-administered portion of Kashmir is for the most part ethnically, linguistically, and culturally different from the Valley of Kashmir, a part of Indian-administered Kashmir. Partition based on the Chenab formula is opposed by some Kashmiri politicians, although others, including Sajjad Lone, have suggested that the non-Muslim part of Jammu and Kashmir be separated from Kashmir and handed to India. Some political <b>analysts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the Pakistan state policy shift and mellowing of its aggressive stance may have to do with its total failure in the Kargil War and the subsequent 9/11 attacks. These events put pressure on Pakistan to alter its position on terrorism. Many neutral parties to the dispute have noted that the UN resolution on Kashmir is no longer relevant.
