25|$|An Amorph (gene), a term {{utilized}} by Muller in 1932, is a mutated allele, which {{has lost the}} ability of the parent (whether wild type or any other type) allele to encode any functional protein.

25|$|Loss-of-{{function}} mutations, {{also called}} inactivating mutations, {{result in the}} gene product having less or no function (being partially or wholly inactivated).

5000|$|Amorphic {{describes}} a mutation that causes complete loss of gene function. Amorph is sometimes used interchangeably with [...] "genetic null".

40|$|Dominant {{mutations}} at two loci, BicaudalC (BicC) and BicaudalD (BicD), cause heterozygous {{females to}} produce double-abdomen embryos. These mutations cause {{the production of}} embryos {{with a range of}} defects extending from the anterior end of the differentiated embryo. The same array of defective embryos is caused by mutations at either locus and is similar to that produced by the original mutation at bicaudal (bic). The array of defective embryos suggests that these mutations cause the loss of positional values from the anterior end of the embryo, associated with a duplication of the posterior end if too few positional values remain. BicaudalD mutations appear to be antimorphic, gain-of-function mutations, whereas BicaudalC mutations are likely to be hypomorphic or <b>amorphic</b> <b>mutations.</b> Mutations at all these loci (bic, BicC and BicD) act as mutual enhancers of each other, {{and a number of other}} maternal-effect mutations also act to either enhance or suppress the expression of these dominant bicaudal mutations...|$|R
40|$|A two-step {{screen for}} {{isolating}} null mutations of the spineless-aristapedia locus has been performed, and several <b>amorphic</b> <b>mutations,</b> {{as well as}} a small deficiency, have been obtained. With the exception of the deficiency, which deletes genes required for viability {{on either side of the}} spineless-aristapedia locus, these mutations result in a transformation of only the distal antenna into distal leg, thereby indicating that the spineless-aristapedia gene is required for specifying antennal as opposed to leg development in only the distal portion of the antenna. Because this distal region does not appear to be a developmental compartment, it is probable that the spineless-aristapedia gene, unlike several other homeotic genes, is required for maintaining the correct determined state in a population of cells defined by their relative position, not by their ancestry...|$|R
40|$|<b>Amorphic</b> <b>mutations</b> in the NF-κB {{essential}} modulator (NEMO) cause X-dominant incontinentia pigmenti, {{which is}} lethal in males in utero, whereas hypomorphic mutations cause X-recessive anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency, a complex developmental disorder and life-threatening primary immunodeficiency. We characterized the NEMO mutation 110 _ 111 insC, which creates the most-upstream premature translation termination codon (at codon position 49) of any known NEMO mutation. Surprisingly, this mutation {{is associated with}} a pure immunodeficiency. We solve this paradox by showing that a Kozakian methionine codon located immediately downstream from the insertion allows the reinitiation of translation. The residual production of an NH 2 -truncated NEMO protein was sufficient for normal fetal development and for the subsequent normal development of skin appendages but was insufficient for the development of protective immune responses...|$|R

40|$|Clock is a semidominant X-linked {{mutation}} {{that results}} in shortening the period of Drosophila melanogaster's free-running locomotor activity rhythm from ca. 24. 0 to ca. 22. 5 hr. This mutation similarly shortened the phase response curve, determined by resetting activity rhythms with light pulses. Eclosion peaks for Clk cultures were separated by only 22. 5 hr instead of the normal 24 hr. Clk was mapped close to, but separable from, another rhythm mutation [...] period(01) [...] by recombination. The estimated distance between these two mutations was short enough to suggest that Clk could be a per allele. If this is the case, the new mutant is unique in that it, unlike other per variants, is associated with essentially normal 1 -min courtship song rhythms when Clk is expressed in males. Also, the new rhythm variant could not, {{in contrast to a}} short-period per mutation, have its effects on free-running activity rhythms uncovered by deletions. This result, and the lack of coverage of Clk's effects by duplications, suggest {{that it is not a}} simple hypomorphic or <b>amorphic</b> <b>mutation...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Amorphic</b> <b>mutations</b> in the {{recombination}} activating genes RAG 1 and RAG 2 {{have been}} reported to cause T–B– SCID, whereas hypomorphic mutations led to the expansion of a few autoimmune T cell clones responsible for the Omenn syndrome phenotype. We report here a novel clinical and immunological phenotype associated with recessive RAG 1 hypomorphic mutations in 4 patients from 4 different families. The immunological phenotype consists of the oligoclonal expansion of TCRγδ T cells combined with TCRαβ T cell lymphopenia. The clinical phenotype consists of severe, disseminated CMV infection and autoimmune blood cell manifestations. Repertoire studies suggest that CMV infection, in the setting of this particular T cell immunodeficiency, may have driven the TCRγδ T cell clonal expansion. This observation extends the range of clinical and immunological phenotypes associated with RAG mutations, emphasizing the role of the genetic background and microbial environment in determining disease phenotype...|$|R
40|$|Anhidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia with ImmunoDeficiency (EDA-ID, OMIM 300291) and Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP, OMIM 308300) are two rare diseases, {{caused by}} {{mutations}} of the IKBKG/NEMO gene. The protein NEMO/IKKγ {{is essential for}} the NF-κB activation pathway, involved in a variety of physiological and cellular processes, such as immunity, inflammation, cell proliferation, and survival. A wide spectrum of IKBKG/NEMO mutations have been identified so far, and, {{on the basis of their}} effect on NF-κB activation, they are considered hypomorphic or amorphic (loss of function) mutations. IKBKG/NEMO hypomorphic mutations, reducing but not abolishing NF-κB activation, have been identified in EDA-ID and IP patients. Instead, the <b>amorphic</b> <b>mutations,</b> abolishing NF-κB activation by complete IKBKG/NEMO gene silencing, cause only IP. Here, we present an overview of IKBKG/NEMO mutations in EDA-ID and IP patients and describe similarities and differences between the clinical/immunophenotypic and genetic aspects, highlighting any T and B lymphocyte defect, and paying particular attention to the cellular and molecular defects that underlie the pathogenesis of both diseases...|$|R
40|$|The kinesin- 3 {{family member}} KIF 1 A {{has been shown}} to be {{important}} for experience dependent neuroplasticity. In Drosophila, <b>amorphic</b> <b>mutations</b> in the KIF 1 A homolog unc- 104 disrupt the formation of mature boutons. Disease associated KIF 1 A mutations have been associated with motor and sensory dysfunctions as well as non-syndromic intellectual disability in humans. A hypomorphic mutation in the forkhead-associated domain of Unc- 104, unc- 104 [superscript bris], impairs active zone maturation resulting in an increased fraction of post-synaptic glutamate receptor fields that lack the active zone scaffolding protein Bruchpilot. Here, we show that the unc- 104 [superscript bris]mutation causes defects in synaptic transmission as manifested by reduced amplitude of both evoked and miniature excitatory junctional potentials. Structural defects observed in the postsynaptic compartment of mutant NMJs include reduced glutamate receptor field size, and altered glutamate receptor composition. In addition, we observed marked loss of postsynaptic scaffolding proteins and reduced complexity of the sub-synaptic reticulum, which could be rescued by pre- but not postsynaptic expression of unc- 104. Our results highlight the importance of kinesin- 3 based axonal transport in synaptic transmission and provide novel insights into the role of Unc- 104 in synapse maturation...|$|R
50|$|<b>Amorphic</b> genetic <b>mutations</b> in the IKBKG gene, which {{result in}} the loss of gene function, {{typically}} present themselves as Incontinetia Pigmenti (IP). Because loss of NEMO function is lethal, only heterozygous females or males with XXY karyotype or mosaicism for this gene survive and exhibit symptoms of Incontinetia Pigmenti, such as skin lesions and abnormalities in hair, teeth, and nails. There are a variety of mutations that may cause the symptoms of IP, however, they all involve the deletion of exons on the IKBKG gene.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMutations of the ryanodine {{receptor}} cause {{dominant and}} recessive forms of congenital myopathies with cores. Quantitative defects of RYR 1 {{have been reported}} in families presenting with recessive forms of the disease and epigenic regulation has been recently proposed to explain potential maternal monoallelic silencing of the RYR 1 gene. We investigated nine families presenting with a recessive form of the disease and showing a quantitative defect of RYR 1 expression. Genetic analysis allowed the identification of a mutation on both alleles of the RYR 1 gene for all patients, 15 being novel variants. We evidenced for all patients an alteration of the expression of the RYR 1 gene caused by <b>amorphic</b> <b>mutations</b> responsible either for mRNA or protein instability. In seven families the variant present on the second allele was a missense mutation. In the remaining two families the second variant led to a hypomorphic expression of the RYR 1 gene and was associated with a severe neonatal phenotype, pointing out the minimal amount of RYR 1 needed for skeletal muscle function. Noticeably, a novel additional exon 3 b was characterized in the most severely affected cases. This study showed that all cases presenting with a quantitative defect of RYR 1 expression in our panel of patients affected by recessive core myopathies were caused by the presence of one recessive null allele and that variability of the phenotype depended {{on the nature of the}} mutation present on the second allele. Our study also indicated that presence of a second mutation must be investigated in sporadic cases or in dominant cases presenting with a familial clinical variability...|$|R
30|$|Submicroscopic deletions that reside {{adjacent}} to known causative genes also underlie 46,XY DSD. To date, deletions involving the upstream regions of SOX 9, GATA 4, or NR 0 B 1 {{have been reported}} to cause 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis (Table  1, part b) [10, 12, 18 - 21]. These deletions are predicted to disrupt the cis-regulatory machinery of genes involved in testis formation. For example, SOX 9 is regulated by SRY and plays a critical {{role in the development of}} testis and long bones [1]. SOX 9 abnormalities lead to 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis with or without campomelic dysplasia [1]. It is known that SOX 9 expression is tightly regulated by multiple cis-acting enhancers in the upstream and downstream regions and that elimination of the enhancer(s) leads to tissue-specific dysregulation of SOX 9 [10, 18 - 20]. Previous studies have mapped SOX 9 enhancers for craniofacial tissues to a genomic interval > 1.0  Mb apart from the coding region and a testis enhancer to a 32.5 -kb region at a position 607 to 640  kb upstream from the start codon [10, 18 - 20]. These enhancer regions seem to contain transcription factor binding sites which are essential to maintain SOX 9 expression during development. Since microdeletions in the SOX 9 upstream region can result in complete gonadal dysgenesis similar to that observed in patients with SOX 9 <b>amorphic</b> <b>mutations,</b> elimination of the distal enhancer seems to completely abolish SOX 9 expression on the affected allele [10, 18 - 20]. Deletions in the upstream regions of GATA 4 and NR 0 B 1 are also likely to encompass cis-acting enhancers of these genes [12, 18, 21]. Identification of deletions in the upstream or downstream regions of genes provides clues regarding cis-regulatory mechanisms of each gene.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the mechanism of}} sex determination in the germ line, we analyzed the fate of XY germ cells in ovaries, {{and the fate of}} XX germ cells in testes. In ovaries, germ cells developed according to their X:A ratio, i. e., XX cells underwent oogenesis, XY cells formed spermatocytes. In testes, however, XY and XX germ cells entered the spermatogenic pathway. Thus, to determine their sex, the germ cells of Drosophila have cell-autonomous genetic information, and XX cells respond to inductive signals of the soma. Results obtained with <b>amorphic</b> and constitutive <b>mutations</b> of Sxl show that both the genetic and the somatic signals act through Sxl to achieve sex determination in germ cells...|$|R
40|$|The Drosophila gene argos encodes a diffusible {{protein that}} acts as a {{negative}} regulator of cell fate decisions. To define interacting gene products, we performed a genetic analysis of argos, which suggests the presence of several partially redundant gene functions in its immediate vicinity at the chromosomal position 73 A. Dose titration experiments have identified two of these loci. One of them corresponds to the gene bulge. Loss of function bulge alleles suppress the rough eye phenotype associated with overexpression of argos; conversely, <b>amorphic</b> argos <b>mutations</b> suppress the eye phenotype seen in flies bearing a single dominant bulge allele. Recombination mapping localized bulge 0. 15 cM distal to argos. A second gene, suppressor of bulge and argos (soba), corresponds to the recently described lethal complementation group 73 Aj. soba alleles suppress the eye phenotypes seen in flies expressing either the dominant bulge allele or the hs-argos construct. soba resides 120 kb proximal to argos. In addition, we have identified one allele of a new gene, clown, which like soba suppresses the eye phenotypes associated with hs-argos and bulge(Dominant). clown maps on chromosome 3 at the cytological position 68 CD...|$|R

40|$|Summary During oogenesis, in Drosophila melanogaster, the {{exchange}} of signals between the oocyte and the surrounding follicle cells govern both the polarization of the maturing egg and the subsequent establishment of the future embryonic body axes. Gurken (Grk), a TGF-α-like molecule signaling twice from the oocyte to the overlying follicle cells brings about the polarisation of both axes, the anterior-posterior (AP) and the dorsal-ventral (DV). The signal is perceived by the Drosophila EGF receptor (DER) present in abutting follicle cells. Cornichon (Cni) is a small hydrophobic protein which is absolutely required for Grk signaling. Earlier studies, in the lab, has shown a protein-protein interaction between the ER-luminal domain of Cni and the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) domain of Grk. In this study, {{it has been shown}} that the subcellular localisation of Cni is in line with an ER to Golgi cycling function. By inducing Grk transit through the bulk flow pathway of cellular exocytosis it could be shown that the requirement for Cni in enrichment of Grk vesicles can be overcome. Grk secreted via the bulk flow pathway in absence of Cni is active and signals to the DER. This demonstrates that Cni function is restricted to the transport of Grk from the ER to the Golgi and is not required for modification and/or proteolytic activation of Grk. This mode of ligand trafficking is a new component of the EGF ligand regulatory system. cni is not only required in the oocyte, it has also a somatic functions as indicated by head and wing phenotypes and decreased viability which result from <b>amorphic</b> cni <b>mutations.</b> The somatic, but not the ovarian functions of cni can be rescued by cornichon related (cnir). An earlier study in the lab revealed that a chromosomal deficiency removing regions including cnir is synthetically lethal with cni. A genetic screen was conducted to identify a putative loss of function allele of cnir, from an existing collection of EMS allele in this region. The molecular characterisation of the allele is not yet completed. In addition, an enhancer/suppressor screen in a sensitized genetic background to identify new components or new unidentified roles for known components, in the initiation of the DV axis was conducted. As the sensitized background, a cni hypomorphic allele combination which leads to strongly ventralized eggs with a weak defect in posterior follicle cell specification was used. Deficiencies on the third chromosome were assayed for suppression or enhancement of the cni egg phenotype or for synthetic lethality, upon gene dosage reduction. Eight candidates regions of the third chromosome consisting of one suppressor, four enhancers and three synthetic lethal were identified. The suppression was narrowed down to a single gene namely, pipe. pipe is a gene which is activated directly by the Grk gradient and its activity defines the ventral side of the egg and embryo. Of the other interactors, four of them have been narrowed down to regions containing a few genes...|$|R
