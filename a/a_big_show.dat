25|$|When {{printed books}} on the occult, {{particularly}} in the English language, had begun to be produced, some cunning folk obtained, and used, grimoires, or books of magic. In many cases they made <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>show</b> {{of the fact that}} they owned such tomes, which would have appeared impressive in the minds of many of their customers in a period where only a minority of people were able to read and write in Britain. Indeed, some cunning folk appeared to own these grimoires purely for cosmetic reasons, to impress their clients, and did not actually make use of any of the magical rituals contained within them.|$|E
25|$|The troops proclaimed Julian Augustus in Paris, {{and this}} in turn led to a very swift {{military}} effort to secure or win the allegiance of others. Although the full details are unclear, {{there is evidence to}} suggest that Julian may have at least partially stimulated the insurrection. If so, he went back to business as usual in Gaul, for, from June to August of that year, Julian led a successful campaign against the Attuarian Franks. In November, Julian began openly using the title Augustus, even issuing coins with the title, sometimes with Constantius, sometimes without. He celebrated his fifth year in Gaul with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>show</b> of games.|$|E

500|$|The next {{match was}} the No Disqualification match between <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> and Floyd Mayweather, Jr.. Early in the match, Mayweather {{repeatedly}} escaped <b>Big</b> <b>Show's</b> grasp and delivered body shots to him. Mayweather and his accomplices tried to [...] "walk out" [...] of the match, but <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> {{walked up the}} ramp and brought Mayweather back in the ring. <b>As</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> was about to chokeslam Mayweather, one of Mayweather's accomplices struck a steel chair on <b>Big</b> <b>Show's</b> back, and the latter chokeslammed him in retaliation. Capitalizing from this distraction, Mayweather grabbed that chair and hit <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> multiple times {{on the head with}} it. Finally, Mayweather removed his right glove and {{put on a pair of}} brass knuckles to hit <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> in the face. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> was knocked out as he could not answer the referee's ten count, and Mayweather was declared the winner.|$|R
500|$|Some UN {{aid workers}} {{immediately}} criticized the operation, arguing that very sick children were poorly served by programmes that obliged them to travel hundreds of miles.

2500|$|Critic Gunther Schuller declared, [...] "On {{one point}} there is {{universal}} agreement: Tatum's awesome technique." [...] That technique {{was marked by}} a calm physical demeanor and efficiency. [...] Tatum did not indulge in theatrical physical or facial expression. [...] The effortless gliding of his hands over difficult passages baffled most who witnessed the phenomenon. [...] He especially astonished other pianists to whom Tatum appeared to be [...] "playing the impossible." [...] Even when playing scintillating runs at high velocity, it appeared that his fingers hardly moved. [...] Hank Jones said: When I finally met him and {{got a chance to}} hear him play in person, it seemed as if he wasn't really exerting much effort, he had an effortless way of playing. It was deceptive. You'd watch him and you couldn't believe what was coming out, what was reaching your ears. He didn't have that much motion at the piano. He didn’t make <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>show</b> of moving around and waving his hands and going through all sorts of physical gyrations to produce the music that he produced, so that in itself is amazing. There had to be intense concentration there, but you couldn’t tell by just looking at him play.|$|E

6000|$|Storm-stayed shows used to {{emphasize}} the severity of a Thrums winter. As the name indicates, these were gatherings of travelling booths in the winter-time. Half a century ago the country was overrun by itinerant showmen, who went their different ways in summer, but formed little colonies in the cold weather, when they pitched their tents in any empty field or disused quarry and huddled together {{for the sake of}} warmth: not that they got much of it. Not more than five winters ago we had a storm-stayed show on a small scale; but nowadays the farmers are less willing to give these wanderers a camping-place, and the people are less easily drawn to the entertainments provided, by fife and drum. The colony hung together until it was starved out, when it trailed itself elsewhere. I have often seen it forming. The first arrival would be what was popularly known as [...] "Sam'l Mann's Tumbling-Booth," [...] with its tumblers, jugglers, sword-swallowers, and balancers. This travelling show visited us regularly twice a year: once in summer for the Muckle Friday, when the performers were gay and stout, and even the horses had flesh on their bones; and again in the [...] "back-end" [...] of the year, when cold and hunger had taken the blood from their faces, and the scraggy dogs that whined at their side were lashed for licking the paint off the caravans. While the storm-stayed show was in the vicinity the villages suffered from an invasion of these dogs. Nothing told more truly the dreadful tale of the showman's life in winter. Sam'l Mann's was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>show,</b> and half a dozen smaller ones, most of which were familiar to us, crawled in its wake. Others heard of its whereabouts and came in from distant parts. There was the well-known Gubbins with his [...] "A' the World in a Box:" [...] a halfpenny peepshow, in which all the world was represented by Joseph and his Brethren (with pit and coat), the bombardment of Copenhagen, the Battle of the Nile, Daniel in the Den of Lions, and Mount Etna in eruption. [...] "Aunt Maggy's Whirligig" [...] could be enjoyed on payment of an old pair of boots, a collection of rags, or the like. Besides these and other shows, there were the wandering minstrels, most of whom were [...] "Waterloo veterans" [...] wanting arms or a leg. I remember one whose arms had been [...] "smashed by a thunderbolt at Jamaica." [...] Queer bent old dames, who superintended [...] "lucky bags" [...] or told fortunes, supplied the uncanny element, but hesitated to call themselves witches, for there can still be seen near Thrums the pool where these unfortunates used to be drowned, and in the session book of the Glen Quharity kirk can be read an old minute announcing that on a certain Sabbath there was no preaching because [...] "the minister was away at the burning of a witch." [...] To the storm-stayed shows came the gypsies in great numbers. Claypots (which is a corruption of Claypits) was their headquarters near Thrums, and it is still sacred to their memory. It was a clachan of miserable little huts built entirely of clay from the dreary and sticky pit in which they had been flung together. A shapeless hole on one side was the doorway, and a little hole, stuffed with straw in winter, the window. Some of the remnants of these hovels still stand. Their occupants, though they went by the name of gypsies among themselves, were known to the weavers as the Claypots beggars; and their King was Jimmy Pawse. His regal dignity gave Jimmy the right to seek alms first when he chose to do so; thus he got the cream of a place before his subjects set to work. He was rather foppish in his dress; generally affecting a suit of grey cloth with showy metal buttons on it, and a broad blue bonnet. His wife was a little body like himself; and when they went a-begging, Jimmy with a meal-bag for alms on his back, she always took her husband's arm. Jimmy was the legal adviser of his subjects; his decision was considered final on all questions, and he guided them in their courtships as well as on their deathbeds. He christened their children and officiated at their weddings, marrying them over the tongs.|$|E
