30|$|The kinetic {{characteristics}} of AFM anodic oxidation by the CNT-attached and the conventional probes are further analyzed and discussed below. As {{is evident from}} Fig. 2 a, with the same time duration, the height of oxide nanodots produced by CNT-attached probe is higher than those obtained by the conventional one. The oxides height for both the CNT-attached and conventional probes, each with an <b>anodized</b> <b>voltage</b> of 8 V, {{was estimated to be}} ~ 6.6 and ~ 5.1 nm, respectively. Note that, in the estimation, the electrochemical process is assumed to be solid-state diffusion limited. To give a more quantitative account of the growth kinetics, in Fig. 2 b, the growth rate of oxide nanodots is plotted as a function of electric field strength. The initial growth rate of oxide nanodots induced by the CNT-attached probe is ~ 300 nm/s, which is about 15 times larger than that obtained from the conventional one. Also, it can be clearly seen that the growth rate strongly depends on the electric field strength and, in both cases, the anodic oxidation process is greatly enhanced when the electric field strength is beyond the order of ~ 2 × 107 V cm− 1. In our previous study [13], {{it has been shown that}} the growth rate not only is a function of electric field strength but also depends on the applied <b>anodized</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|R

30|$|According to the {{above-mentioned}} results, {{the growth rate}} of the oxide nanodots is governed via the ionic transportation promoted by the electric field strength. The growth of the oxides is therefore fast in the initial stage of the anodic oxidation process while there is a rapid build-up of space charge taking place simultaneously.

40|$|Abstract—Anodizing is an {{electrochemical}} {{process that}} converts the metal surface into a decorative, durable, corrosion-resistant, anodic oxide finish. Aluminum is {{ideally suited to}} anodizing, although other nonferrous metals, such as magnesium and titanium, also can be anodized. The anodic oxide structure originates from the aluminum substrate and is composed entirely of aluminum oxide. This aluminum oxide is not applied to the surface like paint or plating, but is fully integrated with the underlying aluminum substrate, so cannot chip or peel. It has a highly ordered, porous structure that allows for secondary processes such as coloring and sealing. In this experimental paper, we focus on a reliable method for fabricating nanoporous alumina with high regularity. Starting from study of nanostructure materials synthesize methods.
