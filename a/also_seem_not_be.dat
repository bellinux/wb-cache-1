40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine, from a {{strictly}} linguistic perspective, a phenomenon that has been gaining ground in recent years, especially in the field of politics and social activism: the use in Spanish of feminine forms with an extensive value (referring to beings of both sexes) as a strategy to make women more visible, and as a stylistic alternative to the simultaneous use of both the masculine and feminine form. After comparing the underlying assumptions of the feminists’ position with some linguistic principles, we analyze the conditions under which the generic interpretations of feminine forms take place in ordinary language. We then present the problems that the generalization of the phenomenon can give rise to: limitation of «displacement» capacity (Hockett, 1960), poor processing effort / cognitive effect ratio, and difficulty in accomplishing the communicative function of language. This brings us to the point that the generic feminine is most unlikely to become established in general uses of Spanish; it <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> <b>not</b> to <b>be</b> feasible to achieve a free alternation of masculine and feminine forms as a means of expressing gender neutralization. However, the occasional use of the feminine with extensive value could be made habitual —considering the social function of language— in political discourse, where it would function as a badge that shows membership of (or solidarity with) a social group...|$|R

40|$|The {{validity}} of the soil quality standard for copper (Cu) established by the Spanish legislation (Spanish Royal Decree 9 / 2005) is evaluated in representative agricultural Mediterranean soils under an accumulator crop (Lactuca sativa L. var.

For saline soils, such a soil quality standard <b>seems</b> <b>not</b> to <b>be</b> valid taking into account both of the aspects evaluated. For non-saline soils, the soil quality standard <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>not</b> to <b>be</b> valid since, considering the metal accumulation in the edible part of the plant, the soil quality standard should be above such standard; but considering the productivity function of soil (biomass production), the standard should be much below, meaning that this function is being greatly affected by the presence of high concentrations of Cu. The soil quality standard for each soil considered should correspond to a value between its respective EC 50 and EC 10 values (effective concentrations of added Cu causing 50 % and 10 % inhibition on the biomass production), depending on the politicians and/or farmers' compromise with yield production and, therefore, with soil productivity. These threshold values were greater for the soil having more organic matter and clay content, showing that Cu toxicity also depends on these properties.

All these additives remarkably increased the biochar yield from 31. 7 % (unmodified biochar) to 46. 9 %- 56. 9 % (modified biochars). Carbon loss during pyrolysis was reduced from 51. 7 % to 35. 5 %- 47. 7 %. Thermogravimetric analysis curves showed that the additives {{had no effect on}} thermal stability of biochar but did enhance its oxidative stability. Microbial mineralization was obviously reduced in the modified biochar, especially in the TSP-BC, in which the total CO 2 emission during 60 -d incubation was reduced by 67. 8 %, compared to the unmodified biochar. Enhancement of carbon retention and biochar stability was probably due to the formation of meta-phosphate or C-O-PO 3, which could either form a physical layer to hinder the contact of C with O 2 and bacteria, or occupy the active sites of the C band. Our results indicate that pre-treating biomass with phosphors-bearing materials is effective for reducing carbon loss during pyrolysis and for increasing biochar stabilization, which provides a novel method by which biochar can be designed to improve the carbon sequestration capacity...|$|R

Possible associations between each molecular marker and cow reproductive performance were also analyzed.

Polymorphic information content ranged from 0. 58 to 0. 88 while expected heterozygosity ranged from 65 % to 89 %, with an average mean value of 77 %. Although only three markers were studied, the combined values indicate a high power of exclusion of a false parentage (94 %) and of individual identification (3. 8 x 10 - 4).

Using the observed infrared spectra we determine the mineralogy and dust parameters of the discs, and look for possible differences between the Galactic and extragalactic sources. Methods. Modelling the full spectral range observed allows us to determine the dust species present in the disc and different physical parameters such as grain sizes, dust abundance ratios, and the dust and continuum temperatures. Results. We find that all the discs are dominated by emission features of crystalline and amorphous silicate dust. Only a few sample sources show features due to CO 2 gas or carbonaceous molecules such as PAHs and C 60 fullerenes. Our analysis shows that dust grain processing in these discs is strong, resulting in large average grain sizes and a very high crystallinity fraction. However, we do not find any correlations between the derived dust parameters and properties of the central source.

An investigation, with particular reference to various factors that come into play in prosecutorial decision-making, revealed evidence that suggests degree of undue influence in prosecutorial decision-making. The researcher contends that there is sufficient evidence to infer a causal link between the prevailing climate of uncertainty about the questions informing the research and the manifest lack of credibility of this very important function. There seems to be a lack of recognition for and appreciation of the significant role played by the prosecution service in promoting democracy by ensuring the fair administration of justice. The fact that the prosecution service seems to be a regular target for political interference despite legislative guarantees of its integrity and independence as laid down in the Constitution and the NPA Act suggests an underlying mentality that fails to appreciate or flouts the essential distinction between party and state. Prosecutors also take an oath of office or affirmation before assuming duties in this capacity and this <b>also</b> does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to <b>be</b> sufficient guarantee to make their decision making kosher and to avoid any trace of suspicion.

The mechanisms by which metabolic energy is utilized for active ion transport in this tissue were investigated. The history and main theories of gastric secretion and oxidativephosphorylation were reviewed briefly. Na transport in amphibian and mammalian gastric mucosae was described and discussed. Oxygen consumption, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and creatine phosphate concentration changes and active ion transport in the rabbit foetal gastric mucosa were investigated in the presence and absence of exogenous glucose, during anoxia and reoxygenation and in the presence of ouabain, oligomycin, and dinitrophenol. Investigation of the effect of the presence and absence of exogenous glucose suggested that the tissue contained an energy source other than creatine phosphate. It was also shown that creatine phosphate could however be used to some extent in adverse conditions, such as during anoxia. Experiments on the effect of anoxia and subsequent reoxygenation showed that isolated foetal gastric mucosal cells were capable of resynthesizing adenosine triphosphate after large tissue concentration decreases of both adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate. However, ion transport did <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to <b>be</b> solely dependent on the absolute tissue concentration of adenosine triphosphate. The adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate ratio <b>also</b> did <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to <b>be</b> a direct controlling factor.

We explored whole genome amplification (WGA) to enable multiple molecular analyses. Methods:Eighty-eight advanced-stage NSCLC patients were enrolled. Their low-volume lung biopsies underwent WGA before direct sequencing for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), KRAS (rat sarcoma virus), p 53, and CMET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor) mutations. Overall survival impact was examined. Surgically-resected tumors from 133 early-stage NSCLC patients were sequenced for EGFR, KRAS and p 53 mutations. We compared the mutation frequencies of both groups. Results:It is feasible for low-volume lung biopsies to undergo WGA for mutational analysis. KRAS and CMET mutations have a deleterious effect on overall survival, hazard ratios 5. 05 (p = 0. 009) and 23. 65 (p = 0. 005), respectively. EGFR and p 53 mutations, however, do not have a survival impact. There <b>also</b> does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to <b>be</b> significant differences in the frequency of mutations in EGFR, KRAS, and p 53 between early- and advanced-stage disease: 20 % versus 24 % (p = 0. 48), 29 % versus 27 % (p = 0. 75), 10 % versus 6 % (p = 0. 27), respectively. Conclusions:In advanced-stage NSCLC, KRAS, and CMET mutations suggest poor prognosis, whereas EGFR and p 53 mutations do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have survival impact. Mutations in EGFR, KRAS and p 53 are unlikely to be responsible for the progression of NSCLC from early- to late-stage disease. WGA may be used to expand starting deoxyribonucleic acid from low-volume lung biopsies for further analysis of advanced-stage NSCLC...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Blood {{oxygenation}} level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) is {{a promising}} method for defining brain recovery after stroke quantitatively. Applications thus far {{have assumed that}} the BOLD hemodynamic response in patients after stroke is identical to that in healthy controls. However, because of local vascular compromise or more diffuse vascular disease predisposing to infarction, this assumption may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> justified after stroke. We sought to test whether patients who have suffered a lacunar stroke show BOLD fMRI response characteristics identical to those of healthy controls. METHODS: We measured the BOLD fMRI signal time course in the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the affected hand with finger- or hand-tapping tasks for minimally or mildly impaired right-handed patients (n= 12) after lacunar strokes causing limb weakness and for healthy controls (n= 20). RESULTS: With a right-handed sequential finger-tapping task, the rate of rise and maximum increase of the BOLD signal in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex were > 30 % lower (P< or = 0. 01) in the stroke patients. Similar relative decreases were found for the same task performed with the left hand. These changes were found in patients both in the hemisphere affected by stroke and in the unaffected hemisphere, suggesting that the BOLD fMRI time course differences observed arise from a diffuse functional pathology. The difference between patients and controls <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a result of age alone, since differences <b>were</b> <b>not</b> found between the younger (n= 10; aged 22 to 38 years) and the older (n= 10; aged 56 to 83 years) healthy controls. The effect <b>also</b> does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to <b>be</b> dependent on the specific hand movement task used. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of the BOLD fMRI response can be reduced in stroke patients even if infarcts do not involve the cortex. This may be {{a consequence of the}} stroke, but the observation that the BOLD signal time course is similar in the affected and unaffected hemispheres suggests that it also could result from preexisting pathophysiological changes in the cerebral microvasculature...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} empirical {{findings on}} drinking water supply in Ethiopia from {{a set of}} qualitative and quantitive surveys on rural public services. Access to safe drinking water is very low: 32 % of the surveyed households use safe drinking water sources, and the average {{time to get to}} safe water sources during dry season ranged from 29 minutes to 82 minutes. The households covered in the Ethiopia survey may still have better access than the national average. Households identify drinking water as their main priority concern, yet they report high satisfaction rates and hardly take any action to complain. 71 % of the households were very or somewhat satisfied with the quantity and 52 % with the quality of drinking water, even though access was very low. What is surprising with these findings is the fact that a considerable share of the households identified water as their number one concern among a series of services in their area. This raises questions about how best to elicit information about satisfaction with rural services. Drinking water has undergone far-reaching decentralisation. The construction and major rehabilitation of drinking water facilities is managed by district water desks, which are backstopped by the Regional Water Bureaus. Water committees have been established, each of which usually manages one water facility. Making water committees inclusive seems challenging. Although bringing water to the household is predominantly a task undertaken by women (and their children), the study found that in all sites except for one, the water committee leaders were men The water committees <b>also</b> do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to <b>be</b> very effective in counteracting the top-down nature of service provision. The study found that in some cases the functioning of water facilities was compromised if the organization that constructed the facility did {{not take into account the}} community’s knowledge of water sources in determining where to locate the facility.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) -University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2003. This study {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} perceived problems and constraints facing small Indian owned businesses in the 'downtown' area of Pietermaritzburg. An attempt was further made to profile businesses in the area, to investigate the specific problems and constraints facing them, and to look at problems {{on the basis of}} business sector and type of business. Further, the study aimed to provide information to marketers in the area and to make recommendations from a management point of view. The problems facing SMME's were broadly divided into internal problems, external problems and those facing the firm at industry level. Internal problems are those over which the owner-manager has control and external problems are those over which the owner-manager has no control. The main problem facing SMME's at industry level appears to be competition from similar businesses. The profile of businesses in downtown Pietermaritzburg is as follows: • Owners • Retail businesses • Family owned • Sole proprietors • Male co-owners • Approximately 72 % of the businesses in the sample exist for a period of longer than 10 years. The internal problems faced by the businesses include: • 24 % have no business experience • Businesses do not offer credit facilities • 32 % experience problems in recruiting skilled staff • Location is by far a major constraint in the business The external problems do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to <b>be</b> having a serious! very strong negative impact, however the common external problems faced by these businesses include • Business cycle • Exchange rates • Changes in distribution patterns • Social Cultural factors • Rentals Crime however appears to have the most serious negative impact on the businesses in this area. Medical practices in the area surprisingly do not appear to have stock control systems in place. Operating costs were high for clothing businesses and general dealers. Location appears to be a problem for general dealers, jewelers, medical practices and clothing businesses. Crime appears to be a problem especially for jewelers, medical practices, and general dealers. General dealers, hairdressers and clothing businesses are affected by competition from similar businesses. Clothing businesses are negatively impacted by changes in distribution patterns. There does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to <b>be</b> much difference between retail, service and other businesses with respect to internal and external problems. There <b>also</b> does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to <b>be</b> much difference between owners, managers and partners with respect to internal and external problems...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} an {{examination}} of the relationship of attitudes toward advertising images and self-perceptions of older women. A major component of this study focused on how older women perceive models in today 2 ̆ 7 s fashion magazines and apparel catalogs. Data were collected from 163 women aged 60 to 80. Full-color photographs of fashion models appearing to be middle-aged or older were presented to participants as stimuli. Age treatments were digitally applied to each of the models, manipulating them to appear younger. This manipulation created two age versions of each model. Questionnaires used in this study were designed to measure participants 2 ̆ 7 feelings about themselves, including their appearance self-discrepancy and body satisfaction, and their beliefs about the model 2 ̆ 7 s appearance and attractiveness.;Results indicated that the sample of older women perceived little discrepancy between their idealized and actual physical appearance. Participants <b>also</b> did <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to <b>be</b> influenced by media ideals in their acceptance of themselves. Overall, older women were fairly satisfied with their bodies. There was no statistically significant evidence suggesting that the more participants compared themselves to fashion models, the less satisfied they were with their appearance. Participants reported that they rarely, if ever, compared themselves to fashion models, suggesting that older women may be less influenced by media standards of beauty as compared to women of younger ages.;In terms of participants 2 ̆ 7 beliefs about the stimulus models, participants had more favorable ratings of the older models as compared to the younger-age versions. Model age had a significant effect on respondents 2 ̆ 7 purchase intentions; participants were more likely to want to purchase clothing worn by older models and indicated a preference for retailers who use older models in their advertising. Perceived similarity to models was found to influence purchase intentions and ratings of fashionability. Participants who perceived more similarity to the models indicated more likelihood to purchase the clothing worn by the models and rated the model 2 ̆ 7 s clothing as more fashionable than those who perceived less similarity. Findings of this study are useful for expanding knowledge of older adults 2 ̆ 7 responses toward various promotional strategies and may assist in shaping effective marketing approaches...|$|R
