500|$|After {{graduating from}} Notre Dame in 2000, Dunst {{continued}} the acting career {{that she had}} begun. As a teenager, she {{found it difficult to}} deal with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child. However, she later expressed that her mother [...] "always had the best intentions". When asked if she had any regrets about the way she spent her childhood, Dunst said: [...] "Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew up and I wouldn't change it. I have my stuff to work out... I don't think anybody can sit <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'My life is more screwed up than yours.' Everybody has their issues." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's lyrical themes explore [...] "hate, {{ignorance and}} sexism", and AllMusic noted its feminist lyrics. According to George Lang of The Oklahoman, [...] "Kittie's lyrics {{are full of}} spit and venom, {{directed}} at preppy cheerleaders, rich kids, rude boys and women who trade on their sexuality". According to the Sun-Sentinel, [...] "Raven" [...] is [...] "inspired by a death threat" [...] from another band. [...] "Jonny" [...] is reportedly a reaction to male domination of women, and [...] "Paperdoll", according to Morgan Lander, is about the degradation of women as objects. Fallon Bowman said that [...] "Choke" [...] is [...] "about someone telling you that they love you so much, and they put you up on a pedestal and make you feel great, then they turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> 'screw you. According to Morgan Lander, [...] "Do You Think I'm a Whore" [...] "is about not judging a book by its cover" [...] and the song's title was given [...] "basically to prove people wrong". [...] "Charlotte" [...] {{was inspired by a}} serial killer from the book Rites of Burial by Tom Jackman and Troy Cole. [...] "Brackish" [...] "is a commentary on a friend of" [...] Kittie [...] "and the relationship that she was in at the time".|$|E
60|$|Roxy had no home now; so she {{resolved}} to go <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> good-by {{to her friends}} and then clear out and see the world--that is to say, she would go chambermaiding on a steamboat, the darling ambition of her race and sex.|$|E

50|$|Chandar asks won’t she {{listen to}} him? She turns <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> she didn’t {{listen to her}} father, who is he then. Chandar {{comes out of the}} house alone. Papa asks where is Sudha, Sudha appears from behind Chandar. Everyone is happy to see her all dressed up.|$|R
50|$|Scene 3, Die Vorladung - Straße (The Subpoena - street)At night, Josef K. {{walks on}} the street, feeling {{threatened}} by invisible forces. A stranger walks past him without a word, but then turns <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> {{that there will}} be a little investigation regarding his situation next Saturday. Josef K. should not miss the date.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then when I entered that hotel, I'd look <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Well, well!" [...] For {{there would}} be the same news-stand, same {{magazines}} and candies grand, same smokes of famous standard brand, I'd find at home, I'll tell! And when I saw the jolly bunch come waltzing in for eats at lunch, and squaring up in natty duds to platters large of French Fried spuds, why then I'd stand right up and bawl, [...] "I've never left my home at all!" [...] And all replete I'd sit me down beside some guy in derby brown upon a lobby chair of plush, and murmur to him in a rush, [...] "Hello, Bill, tell me, good old scout, how is your stock a-holdin' out?" [...] Then we'd be off, two solid pals, a-chatterin' like giddy gals of flivvers, weather, home, and wives, lodge-brothers then for all our lives! So when Sam Satan makes you blue, good friend, that's what I'd up and do, for in these States where'er you roam, you never leave your home sweet home." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I call it {{stepping}} into the picture. You look <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'Gee, what's this all about, and does it feel right for this given picture?' And then {{you go ahead and}} design from that standpoint." ...|$|E
5000|$|When Mr. Cooper {{was arrested}} at Fairey's gallery. Fairey spoke with him, seeking an apology, though said that Cooper [...] "tried to turn it <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> {{that he is the}} victim and that I should feel bad for him." ...|$|E
50|$|On Sunday, Brade reads through Ralph's {{research}} notebooks {{and realizes}} that Ralph's data had been faked, a cardinal sin in chemistry. When Doheny returns, Brade tells {{him about the}} faking, suggesting it as a possible motive for suicide. Doheny, however, twists it <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> that Brade might {{have been trying to}} protect his own reputation by hiding the fraud.|$|R
5000|$|The series {{ends with}} the pair disappearing into a crowded Roman street as Titus Pullo puts his arm <b>around</b> Caesarion <b>and</b> <b>says</b> [...] "Listen, about your father..." ...|$|R
6000|$|I got {{to feeling}} so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. I fidgeted {{up and down}} the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still. Every time he danced <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "Dah's Cairo!" [...] it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it WAS Cairo I {{reckoned}} I would die of miserableness.|$|R
5000|$|Director Jennifer Peedom {{said about}} making the film that [...] "There's a very fine line between making it and not making it, and he didn’t make it. And it's only then that people turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Well, you know, {{what are you doing}} {{it in the first place}} for?," [...] you know. So, it is an {{interesting}} kind of area, and I think there is no black and white." ...|$|E
5000|$|Do {{not tell}} the user to [...] "press any key." ... On the Apple II series computers, you cannot read every key by itself: , , [...] We have also found in testing that new users, in particular, panic when asked to press any key. Over 80% of them will turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "but what key should I press?" [...] In {{questioning}} them about this response, we discovered that they are quite convinced {{that even though the}} prompt implied that all keys were OK to press, some could be dangerous. Of course, they were quite right.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lessons learned}} during this war game proved {{invaluable}} for the Coalition forces during their initial buildup for Desert Shield especially {{with regards to}} the logistic management of the forces. Many planners would just turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> [...] "hey we just did this on Internal Look, right". General Schwarzkopf's astute foresight and in-depth understanding of the Arab politics coupled with a desire to have Central Command ready for any contingency scenario was the cornerstone of the success that was to follow in the days of Desert Storm.|$|E
5000|$|According to Órris Soares, Augusto dos Anjos used to {{make his}} poems in his head, walking <b>around,</b> gesticulating <b>and</b> <b>saying</b> its verses out loud, before putting them into paper.|$|R
5000|$|And {{there was}} a Marine correspondent, Sergeant Dale Dye, who sat with a tall yellow flower {{sticking}} out of his helmet cover, a really outstanding target. He was rolling his eyes <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Oh yes, oh yes, Charlie's got his shit together here, this will be bad," [...] and smiling happily. It was the same smile I saw a week later when a sniper's bullet tore up a wall two inches above his head, odd cause for amusement in anyone but a grunt.|$|R
5000|$|Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson of the Financial Times {{described}} his as [...] "the world's most prized palate". [...] Likewise, Lettie Teague of The Wall Street Journal has {{described him as}} being [...] "widely regarded as the world's most powerful wine critic". [...] Max Lalondrelle, fine wine buying director for Berry Bros & Rudd says: [...] "Nobody sells wine like Robert Parker. If he turns <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> 2012 is the worst vintage I’ve tasted, nobody will buy it, but if he says it’s the best, everybody will." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1947 she {{returned}} to the Belasco Theater after doing seven films in Hollywood, beginning with a leading role in a revival of Antony and Cleopatra, alongside Eli Wallach, Maureen Stapleton and Charlton Heston. She told a critic, [...] "I certainly never really left the theater." [...] Belasco had managed her stage career until shortly before his death. In a tribute to Belasco, she said: All of us who were with him depended upon him so much that we'd just flounder <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "What do I do now?" [...] He was a good soldier, a hard worker, and a great director.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004 BBC Newsnight quoted one Al-Muhajiroun leader, Abu Ibrahim, as saying,When {{they speak}} about 11 September, {{when the two}} planes magnificently run through those buildings, OK and people turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'hang on a second, that is barbaric. Why {{did you have to}} do that?' You know why? Because of ignorance. ... For us it's retaliation. Islam is not the starter of wars. If you start the war we won't turn the other cheek. ... According to you it can't be right. According to Islam it's right. When you talk about {{innocent}} civilians, do you not kill innocent civilians in Iraq? ...|$|E
5000|$|Yoon Kye-sang ( [...] , Yoon Kye-sang) : Yoo-sun's younger brother, {{who takes}} in the Ahn family in his house. He is a doctor at a local {{community}} health center after working at a general hospital. He is cheerful, kind, and selfless, but sometimes obtuse about other people's feelings. He wears a perpetual smile on his face, even when sleeping. He always jokes <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> 농담입니다 (Nongdam-imnida) or [...] "just kidding" [...] while shaking his head. He demonstrates {{a strong sense of}} philanthropy, willing to help the less fortunate during his spare time, and ultimately wants to go to Rwanda on a volunteer trip.|$|E
5000|$|Creative Consultant David Abramowitz says, [...] "When {{you do a}} {{show like}} this Highlander: The Series, {{what you do is}} you make up a lot of it as you go along. The fans used to ask, 'Do you know all the rules from the beginning?' and it's just like in life: You don't know any of the rules. You make them up as you go along and you try your best to be {{consistent}} and so that no one turns <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'Wait a minute, you're cheating!' Because that's one thing we didn't want to do. We didn't want to ever cheat." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nikki is then seen back home, {{smiling at}} the old woman from the {{beginning}} of the film. The concluding scene takes place at her house, where she sits with many other people, among them Laura Harring, Nastassja Kinski, and Ben Harper. A one-legged woman who was mentioned in Sue's monologue looks <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "Sweet!" [...] Niko, the girl with the blonde wig and monkey, can also be seen. The end credits roll over a group of women dancing to Nina Simone's [...] "Sinner Man" [...] while a lumberjack saws a log to the beat.|$|R
5000|$|Three men are {{stranded}} {{on a desert}} island, when a bottle washes up on the shore. When they uncork the bottle, a genie appears and offers three wishes. The first wishes {{to be taken to}} Paris. The genie snaps his fingers, and the man suddenly finds himself {{standing in front of the}} Eiffel Tower. The second man wishes that he were in Hollywood, and with a snap of the genie's fingers, he finds himself on a Tinseltown movie set. The third man, now alone on the island, looks <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "I wish my friends were back." ...|$|R
50|$|Every {{time someone}} sneezes, it is ritualistic to respond “Bless you…Tzara.” This {{came out of}} {{rehearsal}} for The Window in which Tzara Sidley was cast as a docent conducting a tour of an art gallery. During a rehearsal, someone sneezed and Tzara was given the direction to say “bless you” in case that ever happened live on stage - and other spontaneous niceties - {{because it would be}} perfectly natural for her character to do so. From then on, whenever someone in rehearsal sneezed, Broderick would say “Bless you,” and then wheel <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> “Tzara?” expecting her to say “Bless you.” She was oblivious 99% of the time and it became a standing joke.|$|E
5000|$|The Killer {{was one of}} {{the most}} feared sluggers in {{baseball}} history, but he was also one of the nicest people ever to play the game. He {{was one of the}} few players who would go out of his way to compliment umpires on a good job, even if their calls went against him. I'd call a tough strike on him and he would turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> approvingly, [...] "Good call." [...] And he was the same way in the field. And he never did this to get help on close plays, as some players do. The man hit 573 major league home runs and no umpire ever swung a bat for him. Ron Luciano ...|$|E
5000|$|Blackmore {{was unhappy}} about {{carrying}} the Elf line-up along for live performances, {{and so he}} fired everybody except Dio shortly after the album was recorded, due to Driscoll's style of drumming and the funky bass playing of Gruber. Blackmore would continue to dictate personnel {{for the remainder of}} the band's lifetime, with drummer and former bandmate Ricky Munro remarking [...] "he was very difficult to get on with because you never knew when he would turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> 'You're sacked'." [...] Blackmore recruited bassist Jimmy Bain, American keyboard player Tony Carey and drummer Cozy Powell, who had previously worked with Jeff Beck and had some solo success. Powell also greatly appealed to Blackmore in their mutual fondness for practical jokes.|$|E
5000|$|Cowan {{is renowned}} for his {{competitive}} nature and determination. Former teammate Daniel Carter rates Cowan {{as one of}} the best defensive halfbacks going <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> it was like having another loose forward in their side. [...] Coaches and teammates report that Cowan's strongest quality as a person, is his loyalty. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Southlanders Jeff Wilson, Justin Marshall, Mils Muliaina and Corey Flynn all shifted north to play for larger unions, as they looked to advance their prospects. At the beginning of his career, Cowan received several enticing offers from Super Rugby host provinces, but knocked them back to remain with the Stags and Highlanders.|$|R

500|$|Originally in {{the climax}}, the Joker was to kill Vicki Vale, sending Batman into a vengeful fury. Jon Peters {{reworked}} the climax without telling Burton and commissioned production designer Anton Furst {{to create a}} [...] model of the cathedral. This cost $100,000 when the film was already well over budget. Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: [...] "Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'Why am I walking up all these stairs? Where am I going?' 'We'll talk about it {{when you get to}} the top!' I had to tell him that I didn't know." ...|$|R

5000|$|Hilary du Pré {{wrote in}} The Guardian, [...] "At first I could not {{understand}} why people didn't believe my story because I had set out to tell the whole truth. When you tell someone the truth about your family, you don't expect them to turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that it's bunkum. But I knew that Jackie would have respected what I had done. If I had gone for half-measures, she would have torn it up. She would have wanted the complete story to be told." [...] Jay Fielden reported in The New Yorker that she'd said, [...] "When you love someone, you love the whole of them. Those who are against the film want to look only at the pieces of Jackie's life that they accept. I don’t think the film has taken any liberties at all. Jackie would have absolutely loved it." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 2005 {{issue of}} Guitar Player magazine, Malmsteen {{discussed}} his often-ridiculed behaviour, saying that, [...] "I've probably made more mistakes than anybody. But I don't dwell on them. I don't {{expect people to}} understand me, because I'm pretty complex, and I {{think outside the box}} with everything I do. I've always taken the untraveled path. Obviously, people have their opinions, but I can't get too wrapped up in that, because I know what I can do and I know what kind of person I am. And I have no control over what anybody says about me. Back in Sweden I'm 'Mr Personality' in the tabloids, but obviously I can't take that seriously. I know in my heart that if I do the absolute best I can do, maybe ten years from now people may turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> 'he wasn't that bad'." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dale {{has become}} the moral center {{of the group and}} {{especially}} in this episode for him to be going <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Let's retain our humanity," [...] he's the last guy that's preaching that at this point with Rick making the decisions he has been making of late. To lose this guy at this moment means so much for this group. It's going to be such a monumental death that it's going to affect things a great deal moving forward. It seemed like the right time and that to me, all the stories that are {{going to come out of}} this that people haven't seen yet, are worth losing the Dale/Andrea relationship. —Robert Kirkman ...|$|R
5000|$|Originally in {{the climax}}, the Joker was to kill Vicki Vale, sending Batman into a vengeful fury. Jon Peters {{reworked}} the climax without telling Burton and commissioned production designer Anton Furst {{to create a}} 38 ft model of the cathedral. This cost $100,000 when the film was already well over budget. Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: [...] "Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'Why am I walking up all these stairs?

2500|$|Marquis {{tossed a}} {{scoreless}} inning of relief in Game 1 of the 2004 World Series at Boston, and Manager Tony La Russa tabbed Marquis to start Game 4. He {{turned in the}} best performance of any Cardinals starter in the series, pitching 6 innings and giving up 3 runs. He was bested, however, by Boston pitcher Derek Lowe, who threw shutout ball for 7 innings to win the series for the Red Sox. [...] "Whether you lose 100games or win 100games {{and go to the}} World Series, {{the last day of the}} season you're still looking <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying,</b> 'The season is over?
