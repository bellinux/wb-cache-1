5|$|After The English Teacher, Narayan's {{writings}} {{took a more}} {{imaginative and}} creative external style compared to the semi-autobiographical tone of the earlier novels. His next effort, Mr. Sampath, was the first book exhibiting this modified approach. However, it still draws from {{some of his own}} experiences, particularly the aspect of starting his own journal; he <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> marked movement away from his earlier novels by intermixing biographical events. Soon after, he published The Financial Expert, considered to be his masterpiece and hailed {{as one of the most}} original works of fiction in 1951. The inspiration for the novel was a true story about a financial genius, Margayya, related to him by his brother. The next novel, Waiting for the Mahatma, loosely based on a fictional visit to Malgudi by Mahatma Gandhi, deals with the protagonist's romantic feelings for a woman, when he attends the discourses of the visiting Mahatma. The woman, named Bharti, is a loose parody of Bharati, the personification of India and the focus of Gandhi's discourses. While the novel includes significant references to the Indian independence movement, the focus is on the life of the ordinary individual, narrated with Narayan's usual dose of irony.|$|E

25|$|Most keys have needle springs made of {{phosphor}} bronze, stainless steel, beryllium copper, or a gold alloy. The B thumb keys {{typically have}} flat springs. Phosphor bronze {{is by far}} the most common material for needle springs because it is relatively inexpensive, makes a good spring, and is resistant to corrosion. Unfortunately, it is prone to metal fatigue. Stainless steel <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> good spring and is resistant to corrosion. Gold springs are found mostly in high-end flutes because of gold's cost.|$|E
