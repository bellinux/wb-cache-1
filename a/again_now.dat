5|$|The scene changes <b>again,</b> <b>now</b> to bright {{daylight}} and blue sky. Two men are driving an old Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider passo corto down an empty road. As {{one of the}} men helps the girl up, she spreads her wings and he holds her hands while she gains confidence. With a nudge she is airborne, but she seems hesitant and afraid as he lets go.|$|E
5|$|Scarlett is widowed when Charles dies from {{a bout of}} {{pneumonia}} and measles while serving in the Confederate Army. Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in Atlanta to cheer her up, although the O'Haras' outspoken housemaid Mammy tells Scarlett she knows she is going there only to wait for Ashley's return. Scarlett, who should not attend a party while in mourning, attends a charity bazaar in Atlanta with Melanie where she meets Rhett <b>again,</b> <b>now</b> a blockade runner for the Confederacy. Celebrating a Confederate victory and {{to raise money for}} the Confederate war effort, gentlemen are invited to bid for ladies to dance with them.

5|$|Mulder {{investigates the}} airbag on Skinner's car, {{which was the}} one used to hit Sharon. Scully defends Skinner to the Office of Professional Responsibility, but it does no good and he is fired. Mulder {{believes}} this was done to weaken the X-Files. Mulder, {{with the help of}} Agent Pendrell finds a face imprint in the airbag which is not Skinner's. He goes to see the prostitute's boss again but discovers that she has been murdered. The agents hope to use Judy, an employee who saw the man who actually hired the prostitute and use her to set up another meeting with him. They agree to meet at the Ambassador Hotel in an hour. Skinner goes to see his wife, telling her why he could not sign the divorce papers. An alarm on Sharon's vital sign monitor starts sounding, but as Skinner is about to run for help, the old woman once again takes the place of Sharon, beckoning him to come closer. As Skinner leans in, he sees his wife <b>again,</b> <b>now</b> awakened from the coma; she says something inaudible to him.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} {{bank of the}} river, NY31 exits NY690 but joins NY370 {{at the end of}} the exit ramp. Together, NY31 and 370 enter Baldwinsville, {{intersecting}} NY48 in the village center. Three blocks from NY48, NY370 splits from NY31. As NY370 heads for downtown Syracuse, NY31 continues east, overlapping NY631 for a short distance before passing through Lysander New Community and crossing the Seneca River <b>again.</b> <b>Now</b> in the town of Clay, NY31 meets NY481 at an interchange in the shadow of the Great Northern Mall. NY31 continues eastward through the town to Cicero, where it meets US11 and I-81 at exit30. As NY31 heads away from I-81, Oneida Lake slowly becomes visible to the north. NY31 comes within a mile (about 1.6km) of the lakeshore before turning slightly to parallel the shoreline. Near the Madison County line, here delimited by Chittenango Creek, NY31 enters the western half of Bridgeport and meets the eastern terminus of NY298 near the banks of the creek. NY31 continues eastward, crossing the creek and entering Madison County and the remaining portion of Bridgeport.|$|E
5|$|The Bessy comics {{were also}} {{published}} in Felix, a German comic magazine by Bastei Verlag. From 1965 on, {{they wanted to}} publish a complete new story every month, a rhythm they increased to twice a month in 1966. Unable to produce so fast, Vandersteen had to expand his Studio considerably. Led by Karel Verschuere, a team of some ten young artists mass-produced the comics, which were of considerable lower quality. The {{most important of these}} artists were Frank Sels and Edgar Gastmans, while many stories were produced by Daniël Janssens. When in late 1967 Verschuere quit, {{and at the same time}} Bastei increased the rhythm <b>again,</b> <b>now</b> to one complete comic a week, the Studio was disbanded and Sels and Gastmans started to work on a free lance basis. The next year, they decided to go behind Vandersteen's back and to sell directly to the Germans. Vandersteen then had to reorganize the Bessy Studio and hired Jeff Broeckx. The Studio continued until 1985, with artists like Patrick van Lierde, Ronald Van Riet, Eugeen Goossens, and Walter Laureyssens. It produced more than 900 Bessy-comics.|$|E

5|$|This {{time the}} mere {{presence}} of the Theban army was not enough to cow the opposition. Since time was passing and the Mantinean alliance showed no signs of capsizing, Epaminondas decided {{that he would have to}} break the stalemate. Hearing that a large Lacedaemonian force was marching to Mantinea, and that Sparta was practically undefended, he planned an audacious night-time march on Sparta itself. However, the Spartan king Archidamus was alerted to this move by an informant, probably a Cretan runner, and Epaminondas arrived to find the city well-defended.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 508510 Although he did attack the city, he seems to have drawn off relatively quickly on discovering that he had not, after all, surprised the Spartans. Furthermore, the Lacedaemonian and Mantinean troops which had been stationed at Mantinea had marched to Sparta during the course of the day, and dissuaded Epaminondas from attacking <b>again.</b> <b>Now</b> hoping that his adversaries had left Mantinea defenseless in their haste to protect Sparta, Epaminondas counter marched his troops back to his base at Tegea, and then dispatched his cavalry to Mantinea. However, a clash outside the walls of Mantinea with Athenian cavalry foiled this strategy as well.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 510512 Realising that the time allotted for the campaign was drawing to a close, and reasoning that if he departed without defeating the enemies of Tegea, Theban influence in the Peloponnesus would be destroyed, he decided to stake everything on a pitched battle.|$|E

25|$|When Childeric II {{was murdered}} at Bondi that year, by a disaffected Frank, Theoderic III was reinstalled as king in Neustria with Leudesius as his mayor.

Each looked for support to a different Merovingian king, Ebroin even proclaiming a false Merovingian imposter as sovereign. In a short time Ebroin caused Leudesius to be murdered and became mayor once <b>again,</b> <b>now</b> with a score to settle with Leodegar.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{quotation}} marks, {{also called}} inverted commas or speech marks, {{is complicated by}} the fact that there are two kinds: single quotation marks (') and double quotation marks (").

It is the practice to alternate the type of quotation marks used where there is a quotation within a quotation.|$|E

Games played prior to January 15 were thrown out, and the season began <b>again,</b> <b>now</b> with seven teams.|$|E
