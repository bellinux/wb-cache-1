60|$|The Indian boy had tripped and fallen. Bettles stopped {{long enough}} to grip him by the slack of his furs, then headed for a pile of {{cordwood}} already occupied {{by a number of}} his comrades. Yellow Fang, doubling after one of the dogs, came leaping back. The fleeing animal, free of the rabies, but crazed with fright, whipped Bettles off his feet and flashed on up the street. Malemute Kid took a flying shot at Yellow Fang.

60|$|Out {{there in}} the midst of such a {{succession}} of big smoky ones, a third man was added to our party, one Freeth. Shaking the water from my eyes as I emerged from one wave and peered ahead to see what the next one looked like, I saw him tearing in on the back of it, standing upright on his board, carelessly poised, a young god bronzed with sunburn. We went through the wave on the back of which he rode. Ford called to him. He turned an <b>airspring</b> from his wave, rescued his board from its maw, paddled over to us and joined Ford in showing me things. One thing in particular I learned from Freeth, namely, how to encounter the occasional breaker of exceptional size that rolled in. Such breakers were really ferocious, and it was unsafe to meet them on top of the board. But Freeth showed me, so that whenever I saw one of that calibre rolling down on me, I slid off the rear end of the board and dropped down beneath the surface, my arms over my head and holding the board. Thus, if the wave ripped the board out of my hands and tried to strike me with it (a common trick of such waves), there would be a cushion of water a foot or more in depth, between my head and the blow. When the wave passed, I climbed upon the board and paddled on. Many men have been terribly injured, I learn, by being struck by their boards.|$|E
50|$|Air bag or air strut {{failure is}} usually caused by wet rust, due to old age, or {{moisture}} within the air system that damages {{it from the}} inside. Air ride suspension parts may fail because rubber dries out. Punctures to the air bag may be caused from debris on the road. With custom applications, improper installation may cause the air bags to rub against the vehicle's frame or other surrounding parts, damaging it. The over-extension of an <b>airspring</b> which is not sufficiently constrained by other suspension components, such as a shock absorber, may also lead to the premature failure of an <b>airspring</b> through the tearing of the flexible layers. Failure of an <b>airspring</b> may also result in complete immobilization of the vehicle, since the vehicle will rub against the ground or be too high to move. However, most modern automotive systems have overcome many of these problems.|$|E

40|$|Frame and cab {{suspension}} {{designs of}} Class 8 heavy trucks were investigated {{to see their}} effects on ride comfort. Four trucks were used in this study, each with a different frame: a factory low frame, a lightweight low frame, a factory high frame, and a lightweight high frame. There were two different frame heights and three thicknesses. Two different rear cab suspensions were also tried out on each truck. Both suspensions used two <b>airsprings</b> and two dampers mounted vertically to control the vertical motion. The first suspension used two horizontally mounted dampers to control the lateral motion, while the second used a panhard rod connected to a torsion spring. In addition, two different sets of <b>airsprings</b> and two sets of vertical shocks were tried with each suspension, giving eight suspension combinations. The trucks were shaken through the forward drive (second) axle using two 5500 lb hydraulic actuators with displacement control. The steering (first) axle was left {{in contact with the}} ground (through the tires) and the rear drive (third) axle was strapped to the truck’s frame and acted solely as dead weight. The actuators were given various inputs including single frequency sinusoidal signals, step signals, and decreasing amplitude chirp signals. Both roll and heave modes of the truck were excited...|$|R

40|$|The {{mathematical}} model of suspension components in a railway vehicle {{may have an}} important effect {{on the results of}} vehicle dynamics simulations and their accuracy in reproducing the actual vehicle behaviour. This paper aims to define and compare alternative {{mathematical model}}ling approaches for the secondary <b>airspring</b> suspension and to assess their effect on the accuracy of rail vehicle dynamics multibody simulation. To derive reliable models of the suspension, a quasi-static and dynamic characterisation of the suspension was performed by means of a full-scale laboratory experiment. Based on this, two different modelling approaches were developed for the <b>airspring</b> suspension: a quasi-static one, in which the frequency-dependent behaviour of the suspension is neglected, but the coupling between shear and roll stiffness is included, and a dynamic one in which additionally the frequencydependent behaviour of the suspension in vertical direction is represented using a thermodynamic model, and additionally the dependency of lateral/roll stiffness parameters on the load is incorporated. The results of vehicle dynamics simulations in curved track and/or in the presence of crosswinds and the results of ride comfort calculations are presented, to assess the effect of the models developed, in comparison with a simpler model only reproducing the vertical and lateral stiffness of the suspension. It is demonstrated that the quasi-static coupling effect between shear and roll deformation in the airsprings can have a large effect on the simulation of load transfer effects in curved track and in the presence of crosswinds, and hence remarkably affect the assessment of ride safety and track loading, whereas the dynamic model of the <b>airspring</b> suspension appears to be required when wheel unloading under the action of crosswind is evaluated. Finally, it is shown that a dynamic model of the <b>airspring</b> is required to assess ride comfort correctly, especially when the pneumatic layout of the suspension includes a long pipe between the <b>airspring</b> and the reservoir...|$|E
40|$|Higher working {{speeds of}} mobile {{off-road}} vehicles arouse dynamical problems like excessive vibrations, which decrease the vehicle lifetime, the driver's comfort, {{and the working}} precision. Testing the vibration behaviour of present vehicles is an indispensable source of knowledge for further improvement of vehicle dynamics. More restrictive legislation concerning allowable exposure of drivers to vibrations raises the need for these tests. For small- and medium-sized companies the required know-how and equipment is too expensive and vibration analysis of their products has to be farmed out. Since tests in situ have many advantages, a prototype of a mobile low power test rig for experimental modal analysis on vehicles is described in this paper. The vehicle under test is excited vertically under one of its wheels while the other wheels rest on stationary platforms. The power saving by using an <b>airspring</b> parallel to the actuator is investigated by including {{a model of the}} <b>airspring</b> in the equations of motion of the test rig. It turned out that the power saving due to the <b>airspring</b> is proportional to the relation of the acceleration due to gravity to the maximum acceleration of the excitation signal. For small band excitation signals extra power savings can be achieved by connection of the <b>airspring</b> with a pressure vessel which optimal size depends on the frequency content of the excitation signal. Experiments with a prototype of the vertical shaker demonstrate that the different modeshapes of a tractor-sprayer combination can be sufficiently excited and modal analysis was performed successfully.

40|$|On {{classical}} passenger trains, {{the secondary}} Suspension is commonly ensured by <b>airsprings</b> which are integrated in a pneumatic circuit. In {{addition to the}} pneumatic bellows. the circuit contains various pneumatic components such as tanks, pipes, orifices, levelling valves. etc., {{the purpose of the}} latter being, to maintain a costant height between the carbody and the bogie. These elements can be connected in several ways leading, to many existing suspension topologies. This paper deals with multidisciplinary modelling of a vehicle equipped with such a suspension taking into account both multibody and pneumatic aspects. First, it depicts in more detail the various elements of a pneumatic; suspension. Then, many criteria that influence the suspension morphology are presented: the kind of bogie, the use of an auxiliary tank, the position of this tank relative to the bellows, the kind of levelling system, the use of all additional anti-roll bar, the use of an additional hydraulic damper, etc. The description of the complete pneumatic Circuit implies the use of thermodynamic models which take into account the airflow through the pipes and the valves, the pressure in the bellows, etc, Several pipe models are presented, the choice depending on the length of the pipe: an algebraic model is sufficient for short pipes, while a differential model is needed {{to take into account the}} dynamics of longer pipes. The pneumatic model is then coupled with a SIMPACK multibody model in order to analyse the behaviour of the complete vehicle. Two-point and four-point configurations are compared for Delta Q/Q and curve entry tests...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{possible}} benefits brought by the use of active control of the <b>airspring</b> secondary suspension for high speed railway vehicles; in this regard, active control is applied to reduce the vertical and pitch carbody oscillations in the low frequency range, according to the concept of skyhook damping. A concept is developed for the active <b>airspring</b> suspension, and a numerical model is derived for the vehicle equipped with the active suspension. The results obtained show that the use of active suspension control offers an important improvement of ride quality, by far larger than achievable with semi-active suspensions. On the other hand, the issue of air consumption is outline as a critical point of the proposed concept, requiring further research...|$|E

40|$|On the {{majority}} of modern railway vehicles, <b>airspring</b> are used for the secondary suspension, i. e. the suspension located between the bogie frame and the carbody. The <b>airspring</b> is connected with several other pneumatic components such as auxiliary tanks, pipes, valves, etc. Such a system can be analysed in a multidisciplinary approach by coupling a multibody model of the train with a detailed pneumatic model of the suspension. This paper presents and compares various modelling approach for the pneumatic suspension, focusing on the bellowpipe-tank subsystem. The pipe is described in more details distinguishing models with algebraic or differential equations and models that take compressible effects into acount or not. The various approaches are compared on a simple excitation test and confronted to a reference solution obtained with the commercial FLUENT software. It is shown that the compressible effect can not always be neglected. The influence of the pipe length is also presented...|$|E
40|$|Mechatronic {{technologies}} are increasingly adopted on railway vehicles, with particular reference to active secondary suspensions, {{as a means}} to improve vehicle performancein terms of ride safety and quality. This article presents the results of a theoretical and experimental research aimed at introducing active control capabilities in the pneumatic secondary suspension of a high-speed railway vehicle. The active <b>airspring</b> suspension is used, together with an active lateral suspension, to reduce passengers’ exposure to lateral acceleration in curves and to improve ride safety with respect to vehicle overturning in the presence of extreme crosswind. In this article, the active <b>airspring</b> concept is developed and suitable open- and closed-loop control strategies are proposed. Then, the results of an experimental characterization of the active suspension are reported, and based on these results a mathematical model of the vehicle with active suspension is defined.

40|$|Aims of {{this paper}} are to define testing methods for <b>airspring</b> characterisation, and to {{investigate}} mathematical modelling approaches suitable to reproduce the behaviour {{of this type of}} suspension and their effect on the accuracy of rail vehicle dynamics multi-body simulation. Two different modelling approaches are considered for the airspring: a quasi-static one, suitable for vehicle dynamics simulations in curve and/or in presence of crosswinds, and a dynamic model which is used for the estimation of ride quality, in conjunction with a flexible carbody vehicle model. The results of these models are compared with those provided by simpler models, often used in multi-body simulations: it is demonstrated that the quasi-static modelling of the <b>airspring</b> can have a large effect on the simulation of load transfer effects in curve and in presence of crosswinds. Furthermore, it is shown that a dynamic model of the air spring is required to correctly asses ride comfort, especially when the pneumatic layout of the suspension includes a long pipe between the air spring and the reservoir...|$|E

40|$|Repeatable {{field tests}} {{to measure the}} vehicle {{response}} to unsteady crosswinds are not practical due to safety and economic reasons. Simulations are therefore necessary to gather information on the vehicle response to crosswind. However, in turn, these simulations need to be validated. This study presents results of measured quasi-static and dynamic responses of a stationary rail vehicle due to defined lateral carbody excitations imitating unsteady crosswind, which are reflected by multibody simulations. The vehicle responses are {{measured in terms of}} suspension deflections, lateral carbody accelerations and vertical wheel/rail forces. The vehicle dynamic response to a gust-like event results in an overshoot of wheel unloading. In general the measurements and simulations show good agreement. However, the simulations partly overestimate the responses slightly and an influence due to <b>airspring</b> levelling can be observed in the measured values of quasi-static load cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{deflation}} of an <b>airspring</b> deteriorates {{the riding}} comfort of railway vehicles {{due to an}} increased bending vibration of the car body. This paper describes {{the results of a}} calculation analysis for the car body-bending vibration with deflated airsprings excited at the car body. The results are summed up as follows. The bending vibration characteristics are affected to a large degree by the damping force acting to the primary suspension (axle spring). In case of the bogie structure in which the frictional force of high damping acts on the axle spring, the natural frequency of car bodybending increases when its airsprings deflate. The natural frequency decreases in the bogie structure which has a low damping force such as the usual oil dampers for the axle spring. Unless the oil damper fails, the acceleration amplitude of the latter structure is less than the former one under the deflation of airsprings...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a theoretical and experimental research aimed at introducing active control capabilities in the pneumatic secondary suspension of a high speed railway vehicle. The active <b>airspring</b> suspension is used, together with an active lateral suspension, to provide a limited carbody tilt, reducing passengers’ exposure to lateral acceleration in curves and hence allowing to raise service speed on existing high speed lines. To this aim, a suitable control strategy is defined for the active suspension, based on the combination of open-loop and closed-loop control, and the parameters of the actuation and control system are optimised using simplified models of the actively controlled vehicle. The active suspension concept is then demonstrated by means of laboratory tests performed on a full-scale test stand consisting of one bogie with active pneumatic secondary suspension and of a ballast mass reproducing the inertia of half carbody. The numerical and experimental results obtained show the potential of the proposed active suspension to meet the targets set for the investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a {{vibration}} based Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) unit that may tackle the combined problem of fault detection, isolation (or identification) and magnitude estimation (collectively known as fault diagnosis), in railway vehicle suspensions is presented. The unit is initially “trained ” in a baseline phase based on data obtained from a simplified physics-based model of a railway vehicle suspension. Fault diagnosis is subsequently achieved in an inspection phase through a single, properly preselected, pair of vibration signals acquired from the vehicle, and a recently introduced data-based method, {{referred to as the}} Functional Model Based Method (FMBM), with-out resorting on the physics-based model of the baseline phase. The method’s cornerstone is the novel class of stochastic ARX-type models which are capable of accurately representing a system in a faulty state for its con-tinuum of fault magnitudes. Fault diagnosis feasibility in a railway vehicle suspension is demonstrated via Monte Carlo simulations using different types and magnitudes of faults in the physics-based model and generating vibra-tion signals corresponding to the healthy and faulty suspension. Two vibration signals are used by the diagnosis unit: the track velocity profile and the vehicle body acceleration above the trailing <b>airspring.</b> Fault diagnosis based on the FMBM is effective in a compact and unified statistical framework accounting for experimental and mod-elling uncertainty through appropriate interval estimates and hypothesis testing procedures. The unit is shown to exhibit high sensitivity and accurate estimation of even very small fault magnitudes, to detect and isolate unknown faults for which it has not been trained, and to be robust to high measurement noise, car body mass variations, and varying track irregularity...|$|E
