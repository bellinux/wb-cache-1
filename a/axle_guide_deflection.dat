50|$|The primary {{suspension}} in an ICF Bogie {{is through a}} dashpot arrangement. The dashpot arrangement consists of a cylinder (lower spring seat) and the piston (<b>axle</b> box <b>guide).</b> <b>Axle</b> box springs are placed on the lower spring seat placed on the axle box wing of the axle box housing assembly. A rubber or a Hytrel washer is placed below the lower spring seat for cushioning effect. The <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> is welded to the bogie frame. The <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> acts as a piston. A homopolymer acetyle washer {{is placed on the}} lower end of the <b>axle</b> box <b>guide.</b> The end portion of the <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> is covered with a guide cap, which has holes in it. A sealing ring is placed near the washer and performs the function of a piston ring. The <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> moves in the lower spring seat filled with dashpot oil. This arrangement provides the dampening effect during the running of the coach.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} piston {{arrangement of the}} dashpot, i.e. the Lower Spring seat and the <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> is not fully sealed due to the limitation of the design and practical applicability. Its design provides that when a vertical vibration occurs during {{the movement of the}} railway coach, the <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> moves down. The downward movement of the <b>Axle</b> box <b>guide</b> puts pressure on the oil in the lower spring seat. The oil rushes up. However, since there are holes in the guide cap, the oil passes through these holes into the hollow body of the <b>axle</b> box <b>guide.</b> This helps in dampening the vertical vibrations. The <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> displaces the oil in the lower spring seat and pushes it upwards. Since, only part quantity of oil is able to move up in the hollow portion of the <b>axle</b> box <b>guide,</b> the balance displaced oil moves up.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, rubber washers {{have been}} used at the seating {{arrangement}} of the primary springs of the axle box housing in the ICF design passenger coaches on the Indian Railways. The rubber washer is used directly on the axle box seating area. the lower spring seat sits on the washers. The lower spring seat is a tubular structure and 3/4 section is partitioned by using a circular ring which is welded at the 3/4 section. On the top of spring seat, a polymer ring called NFTC ring sits. The primary spring sits on the NFTC ring. The lower spring seat {{plays the role of}} a cylinder in the dashpot arrangement and is filled with oil. In the dashpot arrangement, the top portion is called the <b>axle</b> box <b>guide.</b> The <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> is welded to the bogie frame.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{application}} of mathematical modelling {{in the field of}} directional behaviour of a vehicle. A model of a bus has been created in the simulation system environment. Its steady state and transient directional behaviour has been compared with experimental results. The structure of the model contains parametrical substructures of the front wheel suspension and rear axle. The ride of the vehicle model along the general track is performed by an approximate model of the driver behaviour. The influence of vehicle load on its directional properties has been shown. The control strategy for all wheel steering, that is able to ensure vehicle neutral behaviour independent on lateral acceleration level, has been formulaed. The steady state as well as transient response of the vehicle with active elements in the rear <b>axle</b> <b>guide</b> has been analysed. The results of the simulations show, that the achieved neutral vehicle behaviour is not dependent on the vehicle load.

40|$|Optical {{trapping}} {{and manipulation}} typically relies on shaping focused light {{to control the}} optical force, usually on spherical objects. However, one can also shape the object to control the light deflection arising from the light-matter interaction and, hence, achieve desired optomechanical effects. In this work we look into the object shaping aspect and its potential for controlled optical manipulation. Using a simple bent waveguide as example, our numerical simulations show that the <b>guided</b> <b>deflection</b> of light efficiently converts incident light momentum into optical force with one order-of-magnitude improvement in the efficiency factor relative to a microbead, which {{is comparable to the}} improvement expected from orthogonal deflection with a perfect mirror. This improvement is illustrated in proof-of-principle experiments demonstrating the optical manipulation of two-photon polymerized waveguides. Results show that the force on the waveguide exceeds the combined forces on spherical trapping handles. Furthermore, it shows that static illumination can exert a constant force on a moving structure, unlike the position-dependent forces from harmonic potentials in conventional trapping. © 2013 Optical Society of America...|$|R

This paper {{discusses}} the {{variation of the}} Modulus of subgrade reaction (k) backcalculated from slab deflection basins, interactive with {{the location of the}} Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) load pulse, and curling of slabs due to daily temperature variations. The k-value was calculated following the AASHTO design <b>guide’s</b> procedures, while <b>deflection</b> basins were recorded at an interval of 3 to 4 hours along the day on an instrumented concrete pavement test section in West Virginia. The state of deformation of the slabs are continuously monitored, through dowel bar bending measurements and records of the temperature gradient profiles through the slab thickness, as well as joint openings every 20 minutes. The results indicated that the backcalculated k-values are greatly affected by the positive temperature gradient, and the least variation in (k) was found in the slab center. In order to minimize errors in back-calculations of k-values, it is recommended to perform the FWD test for recording deflection basins in the interior of the slab during late evening or in the early morning...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{structural}} integrity of wheelset axles of high speed trains {{as well as}} freight wagons is of major importance for safety of rail transport. Up to now the inspection of wheelset axles {{is part of a}} periodic maintenance which is expensive due to long inspection times and highly influenced by the human factor, especially if those inspections are carried out during night time. Permanently installed SHM-systems at each axle would be able to monitor the {{structural integrity}} and could reduce the maintenance effort. However due to mechanical constraints, requirements and regulations the mounting options of such SHM-systems are limited. Approaches with ultrasonic transducers mounted at one end face of the <b>axle</b> can excite <b>guided</b> waves and could be able to monitor the entire component from only one sensor position. The geometry of the axle with many cross-sectional variations results in reflections and changing dispersion relations along the wave propagation direction and lead to complex wave propagation problems hiding flaw echoes. Thus, echo signals are difficult to interpret and correlations between echo signals and flaws are hard to reveal. In the presented paper we show a signal processing approach to extract information on the structural integrity from ultrasonic guided wave echo data. On a mock-up we could show, that the suggested method is able to detect a crack growth reliably. Based on the knowledge of wave propagation and on results from numerical simulations, classification algorithms are developed and applied to additionally enhance the prediction accuracy of crack size and position...|$|R
40|$|A new {{diaphragm}} and dual {{guide rail}} system {{was designed for}} use in a crash cushion for high-speed race tracks. These structural components were designed to provide sufficient lateral support to redirect impacting vehicles and compress the energy-absorbing elements of the crash cushion. The primary design criteria stated that the diaphragm/guide rail system should be capable of withstanding a 100 -kip lateral impact load. The guide rail was to be configured in order to not require replacement after a design impact event. Initial design and modeling resulted in two candidates for guide rail sections which were evaluated during physical testing. The better of the two candidates was then paired with a prototype diaphragm and subjected to dynamic testing. The first prototype was found to develop a maximum resistive force of 175 kips, and the diaphragm guide rail absorbed a total of 822 kip-in. of energy but sustained significant guide rail damage. An extensive computer modeling effort was initiated to optimize both the diaphragm and the guide rails. The structural capacity of the optimized prototype diaphragm and guide rail system was verified through a dynamic bogie test. The second prototype weighed 55 lbs less, developed a maximum resistive force of 212 kips, and absorbed a total of 929 kip-in. of energy, resulting in a <b>guide</b> rail permanent <b>deflection</b> of 1 / 16 in. Meeting all design requirements, the second prototype is recommended for use in the continued development of the crash cushion for high-speed race track applications. Adviser: John D. Rei...|$|R
40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P ME 2016 Ziajaxiv, 195 pages :color illustrationsDevelopment of {{reliable}} structural integrity assessment techniques requires a profound {{understanding of the}} physical phenomena existing in the structure under inspection. As an example, guided waves have been extensively studied to enhance their usability for Structural Health Monitoring in various fields of engineering. The knowledge on elastic wave propagation in various types of structures has enabled the development of effective damage detection methods with long range inspection capabilities. Despite the effort, there exists obvious lack of work on certain types of structures germane to industrial applications, an example {{of which is the}} high speed railway <b>axle</b> monitoring. Although <b>guided</b> wave-based approaches can potentially reduce the maintenance costs and allow for on-line monitoring, the lack of in-depth knowledge on thick-walled hollow cylindrical waveguides limits the current inspection techniques to non-destructive testing only. The main aim of this thesis is to provide a quantitative understanding on the elastic wave propagation in hollow cylindrical waveguides with significant thickness-to-wavelength ratio. The work consists of two major parts: 1). Investigation of the cylindrical guided wave theory and understanding of various types of propagating waves and their characteristics; and 2). Utilization of the acquired knowledge to develop an effective damage detection methodology for railway axle inspection. To this end, a semi-analytical analysis is first performed to investigate the characteristic features of cylindrical guided wave modes and to establish the relationship between a thick plate and a hollow cylindrical waveguide. The analysis reveals the pseudo-symmetry relations of displacement patterns, obtained using asymptotic approximations of Bessel functions. Hyperbolic behavior of the dispersion curves and mode-shape transitions due to the mode coupling phenomenon are also analysed. Theoretical solutions of the dispersion characteristics are compared with the numerical simulations with local interaction simulation approach, and validated through experiments using laser vibrometry. It is shown that, due to the high thickness-to-wavelength ratio, ultrasonic waves propagating in thick-walled cylindrical structures such as train axles exhibit complex multimodal dispersive behaviour, thus causing significant difficulties to the conventional guided wave-based damage detection techniques. Through numerical analyses, a strong damage-related feature in the 'quasi-surface' longitudinal guided wave signals is revealed and confirmed by experiments. Namely, a near-field wave enhancement effect due to the outer diameter change in the structure is found to be highly effective for damage identification. Based on this phenomenon, a novel inspection method is proposed and explored. Finally, a complete monitoring strategy for hollow railway axles is established and validated.

40|$|Metodologia: Na primeira parte desse trabalho realizou-se um estudo descritivo sobre aspectos relacionados a aids e sexualidade com a populaÃÃo dos profissionais mÃdicos, enfermeiros e agentes de saÃde das equipes do PSF (programa saÃde da famÃlia) do municÃpio de Fortaleza. O instrumento utilizado para a coleta de dados foi uma adaptaÃÃo do questionÃrio da pesquisa nacional acerca do Comportamento Sexual da PopulaÃÃo Brasileira, elaborado pelo MinistÃrio da SaÃde, no ano de 2000. Na segunda fase da pesquisa foi feito um estudo qualitativo com a formaÃÃo de grupos focais, com esta mesma populaÃÃo, abordando temas relacionados Ã aids e a sexualidade humana. A partir de um conjunto de referÃncias para os estudos sobre AIDS (os estudos da Antropologia) e levantamentos feitos por estudiosos na Ãrea, chegou-se aos seguintes eixos norteadores: I) as prÃticas sexuais como prÃticas sociais; II) A construÃÃo social das prÃticas sexuais acompanha o dinamismo das culturas e III) as prÃticas sexuais que sÃo prÃticas sociais, sÃo vividas por sujeitos multidimensionais. Resultados da primeira etapa: a pesquisa apontou que a prÃtica sexual entre pessoas do mesmo sexo e a existÃncia de relaÃÃes extraconjugais foi amplamente rejeitada pelos participantes da pesquisa. Apesar de quase todos haverem realizado treinamentos em aids, alguns revelaram que a doenÃa se pode pegar usando banheiros pÃblicos, fazendo-se uso da camisinha masculina ou feminina ou usando o mesmo talher de pessoas contaminadas. A maioria apontou que os preservativos sÃo desagradÃveis mas mesmo assim deve-se usÃ-los para se evitar a aids. Resultados da segunda etapa: O estudo nos revelou uma concepÃÃo mÃtica que envolve aspectos relacionados Ã doenÃa colocando-a,quase sempre, como uma coisa do outro; o preservativo por sua vez, adquiriu um status de instrumento de intermediaÃÃo na relaÃÃo de poder; vislumbrando-se, tambÃm, uma concepÃÃo de naturalizaÃÃo nas relaÃÃes interpessoais mediadas por essas relaÃÃes de poder.
