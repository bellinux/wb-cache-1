He explained why he chose to write the book <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>point,</b> emphasizing it was to provide a guide for the public, and [...] "because impeachment is a political process that occurs outside of the courts. It is responsive to the people, and if impeachment is going to take place, it will be because the American people demand it." [...] Lichtman said because there were many potential unlawful activities, [...] "I believe he is more vulnerable than any early president {{in the history of the}} nation." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{very early}} {{development}} {{stages of a}} collaborative argumentations system entitled Pacisco is described. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>particular</b> {{emphasis is on the}} interface and interaction design of the analytic functionality. Three examples of open-access collaborative argumentation systems currently available on the Web are examined briefly to provide a context {{for the development of a}} new system. The approach of Pacisco is differentiated from its predecessors as encouraging detailed comprehension and auditing of debate rather than establishing outright victory for one position. The argumentation schema employed is based on that described by Stephen Toulmin in ‘The Uses of Argument' (1958), but modified to enable chains of reasoning to be captured. To provide a context for development of the prototype, four fundamental requirements are identified; integrate well with other web systems, allow only anonymous contribution, be intrinsically secure, be transparent. How these requirements should be represented in the design is indicated. The proposed development process is described briefly...|$|R
40|$|Education is an {{essential}} value in a society of axiological pluralism, and its accessibility {{is one of the}} priorities in the context of social justice. In education, the idea of unity in difference ought to find its fulfillment. The lessening of educational differences - between persons of different social groups and persons of different phases of development - stands out among the central aims of Polish politics of education. The present paper points out the existing barriers in the access to education. In addition, it explicates the measures adopted by the state for the furthering of equality and social justice. As a result of considering such interventions, it is apparent that the social context of a functioning educational system is certainly amenable to positive changes. Education has the potential to serve as a locus of resistance against injustices. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>particular</b> questions become apparent, too. Which place is to be allocated in the competition for education to the village and small-town inhabitants, to the economically weak regions, and to the representatives of the poorer strata of society...|$|R

5000|$|As a {{point of}} {{reference}} for PSPP the principles of action of a democratic state should be chosen. The democratically legitimated state follows principles {{of the common good}} as a way of “guaranteeing citizens optimal overall opportunities for living and expression/development” (Reinhold 2000:204). The state’s conception of what the common good is, is expressed in laws. This makes constitutions and city statutes the most suitable indicators of the smallest-common -denominator consensus as to what can be considered to be the common good in a democratically organised society. Beyond <b>this,</b> <b>at</b> any <b>particular</b> <b>point</b> in time the current government is an expression of the society’s current vision of the common good. If we follow the chain of the “common good” orientation down from the national to the local level, we arrive at other structures e.g. in Austria the provinces and the local communities/municipalities, each of which has to some extent its own definition of the common good.If certain people or groups of people do not have full access to the elements of what, as legitimated by the democratic legal system, is regarded as an acceptable minimum level of income, welfare, general living conditions and social participation, then we can say that they are socially disadvantaged.|$|R

60|$|Yet, {{in spite}} of all this, Mr. Snyder was annoyed. He {{realized}} now how large a part the desire to reduce Oakes' self-esteem had played with him. He further realized, looking at the thing honestly, that he had been firmly convinced that the young man would not come within a mile of a reasonable solution of the mystery. He had desired only that his failure would prove a valuable educational experience for him. For he believed that failure <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>point</b> in his career would make Oakes a more valuable asset to the Agency. But now here Oakes was, within a ridiculously short space of time, returning to the fold, not humble and defeated, but triumphant. Mr. Snyder looked forward with apprehension to the young man's probable demeanor under the intoxicating influence of victory.|$|E
60|$|From the 23d of May {{the work}} of fortifying and pushing forward our {{position}} nearer to the enemy had been steadily progressing. At three points on the Jackson road, in front of Leggett's brigade, a sap was run up to the enemy's parapet, and by the 25th of June we had it undermined and the mine charged. The enemy had countermined, but {{did not succeed in}} reaching our mine. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>point</b> the hill on which the rebel work stands rises abruptly. Our sap ran close up to the outside of the enemy's parapet. In fact this parapet was also our protection. The soldiers of the two sides occasionally conversed pleasantly across this barrier; sometimes they exchanged the hard bread of the Union soldiers for the tobacco of the Confederates; at other times the enemy threw over hand-grenades, and often our men, catching them in their hands, returned them.|$|E

60|$|The {{greater part}} of {{the floor of the}} cavern was covered with {{boulders}} of rock or with hard incrustations of lime, but <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>point</b> there had been a drip from the distant roof, which had left a patch of soft mud. In the very centre of this there was a huge mark--an ill-defined blotch, deep, broad and irregular, as if a great boulder had fallen upon it. No loose stone lay near, however, nor was there anything to account for the impression. It was far too large to be caused by any possible animal, and besides, there was only the one, and the patch of mud was of such a size that no reasonable stride could have covered it. As I rose from the examination of that singular mark and then looked round into the black shadows which hemmed me in, I must confess that I felt for a moment a most unpleasant sinking of my heart, and that, do what I could, the candle trembled in my outstretched hand.|$|E
60|$|I was {{compelled}} to wait for Anneke, who fell upon her knees, and remained there quite a minute, before I could aid her in ascending the steep acclivity which formed the western bank of the Hudson, <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>point.</b> We reached the top, however, after a little delay, and pausing once or twice to take breath; when we first became really sensible of the true character of the scene from which we had been delivered. Dim as was the light, there was enough to enable us to overlook a considerable reach of the river, from that elevated stand. The Hudson resembled chaos rushing headlong between the banks. As for the cakes of ice--some darting past singly, and others piled as high as houses--of course, the stream was filled with such; but, a large, dark object was seen coming through that very channel, over which Anneke and I had stood, {{less than an hour}} before, sailing down the current with fearful rapidity. It was a house; of no great size, it is true, but large enough to present a singular object on the river. A bridge, of some size, followed; and a sloop, that had been borne away from the wharves of Albany, soon appeared in the strange assemblage, that was thus suddenly collected on this great artery of the colony.|$|E
60|$|The base of {{the spur}} was cut into broad flat terraces, {{composed}} of unstratified sand, pebbles, and boulders; the remains, doubtless, of an enormously thick glacial deposit. The terracing is as difficult to be accounted for in this valley as in that of Yangma (East Nepal); both valleys being far too broad, and descending too rapidly to admit of the hypothesis of their having been blocked up in the lower part, and the upper filled with large lakes.* [The formation of small lakes, however, between moraines and {{the sides of the}} valleys they occupy, or between two successively formed moraines (as I have elsewhere mentioned), will account for very extensive terraced areas of this kind; and it must be borne in mind that when the Momay valley was filled with ice, the breadth of its glacier at this point must have been twelve miles, and it must have extended east and west from Chango Khang across the main valley, to beyond Donkia. Still the great moraines are wanting <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>point,</b> and though atmospheric action and the rivers have removed perhaps 200 feet of glacial shingle, they can hardly have destroyed a moraine of rocks, large enough to block up the valley.] Another tributary falls into the Lachoong at Momay, which leads eastwards up to an enormous glacier that descends from Donkia. Snowy mountains rise nearly all round it: those on its south and east divide Sikkim from the Phari province in Tibet; those on the north terminate in a forked or cleft peak, which is a remarkable and conspicuous feature from Momay. This, which I have called forked Donkia,* [Its elevation by my observations is about 21,870 feet.] is the termination of a magnificent amphitheatre of stupendous snow-clad precipices, continuously upwards of 20,000 feet high, that forms the east flank of the upper Lachoong. From Donkia top again, the mountains sweep round to the westward, rising into fingered peaks of extraordinary magnificence; and thence--still running west--dip to 18,500 feet, forming the Donkia pass, and rise again as the great mural mass of Kinchinjhow. This girdle of mountains encloses the head waters of the Lachoong, which rises in countless streams from its perpetual snows, glaciers, and small lakes: its north drainage is to the Cholamoo lakes in Tibet; in which {{is the source of the}} Lachen, which flows round the north base of Kinchinjhow to Kongra Lama.|$|E

60|$|One of us {{took the}} boat {{over to the}} {{opposite}} shore, which was flat and accessible, {{a quarter of a}} mile distant, to empty it of water and wash out the clay, while the other kindled a fire and got breakfast ready. At an early hour we were again on our way, rowing through the fog as before, the river already awake, and a million crisped waves come forth to meet the sun when he should show himself. The countrymen, recruited by their day of rest, were already stirring, and had begun to cross the ferry on the business of the week. This ferry was as busy as a beaver dam, and all the world seemed anxious to get across the Merrimack River <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>point,</b> waiting to get set over,--children with their two cents done up in paper, jail-birds broke loose and constable with warrant, travellers from distant lands to distant lands, men and women to whom the Merrimack River was a bar. There stands a gig in the gray morning, in the mist, the impatient traveller pacing the wet shore with whip in hand, and shouting through the fog after the regardless Charon and his retreating ark, as if he might throw that passenger overboard and return forthwith for himself; he will compensate him. He is to break his fast at some unseen place on the opposite side. It may be Ledyard or the Wandering Jew. Whence, pray, did he come out of the foggy night? and whither through the sunny day will he go? We observe only his transit; important to us, forgotten by him, transiting all day. There are two of them. May be, they are Virgil and Dante. But when they crossed the Styx, none were seen bound up or down the stream, that I remember. It is only a transjectus, a transitory voyage, like life itself, none but the long-lived gods bound up or down the stream. Many of these Monday men are ministers, no doubt, reseeking their parishes with hired horses, with sermons in their valises all read and gutted, the day after never with them. They cross each other's routes all the country over like woof and warp, making a garment of loose texture; vacation now for six days. They stop to pick nuts and berries, and gather apples by the wayside at their leisure. Good religious men, with the love of men in their hearts, and the means to pay their toll in their pockets. We got over this ferry chain without scraping, rowing athwart the tide of travel,--no toll for us that day.|$|E
