5|$|After decisive Ottoman {{victory at}} the Battle of Krbava field in 1493, and {{especially}} after the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the Croats continued defending themselves <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman attacks. The Ottoman conquest {{during the early years}} of the 16th century prompted the formation of the Uskoks, which were led by Croatian captain Petar Kružić, also called (Prince of Klis). As a part of the Habsburg defensive system, Uskoks used the base at Klis as an important defensive position. They fought almost alone <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans, and for more than two decades defended the fortress <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman attacks.|$|E

However, his form tapered away during the thrilling 1960–61 home series <b>against</b> <b>the</b> West Indies (which included the first tie in Test history). Harvey was ineffective apart from a score of 85 in the second innings of the Third Test, which Australia lost. He then missed the Fourth Test due to injury. He struggled in the Tests, scoring only 143 runs at 17.88, but prospered <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean tourists in the tour matches, scoring 326 runs at 81.50.

50|$|Points {{scored in}} each game by each team in all league matches are recorded.

5|$|Davis {{improved}} as a blocker in {{his second}} season with the Eagles. At the start of training camp in 1992, Davis vowed to refuse all requests for interviews by the media in an attempt to focus on getting better. In the season-opener <b>against</b> <b>the</b> New Orleans Saints, Davis helped the Eagles lead the NFC in rushing for the week with 186yards. <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> Washington Redskins in week seven on October 18, 1992, he suffered a knee sprain after quarterback Randall Cunningham ran into him. He was listed as doubtful before the following game <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Phoenix Cardinals, and did not play in the game. He was listed as doubtful again before the game <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Dallas Cowboys in week nine. Otho Davis, the team's head athletic trainer, said Davis was not working hard enough to rehabilitate his knee. Antone Davis was upgraded to questionable two days before the game, and started <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Cowboys on November 1. In the wild card playoff game <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Saints on January 3, 1993, Davis gave up a sack against Rickey Jackson, which caused a Cunningham fumble. Davis started in all 15 games he played during the regular season, and started in both of the team's playoff games. Pro Football Weekly rated Davis as the 26th-best offensive tackle in the league for the season.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{tentative}} {{plans for}} a joint German-Japanese approach <b>against</b> <b>the</b> USSR were hinted on in the 1936 Anti-Comintern Pact, the years 1938 and 1939 were already decisive for Japan's decision to not expand northward (i.e., <b>against</b> <b>the</b> USSR) but to the south. The Empire decisively lost two border fights <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Soviets, the Battles of Lake Khasan and Khalkin Gol, thereby convincing itself that the Imperial Japanese Army, lacking heavy tanks and the like, would be {{in no position to}} challenge the Red Army at that time. Nevertheless, Hitler's anti-Soviet sentiment soon led to further rapprochements with Japan, since he still believed that Japan would join Germany in a future war <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, either actively by invading southeast Siberia, or passively by binding large parts of the Red Army, which was fearing an attack of Japan's Kwantung Army in Manchukuo, numbering ca. 700,000 men as of the late 1930s.|$|E
