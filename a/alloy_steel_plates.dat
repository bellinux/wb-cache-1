Disruption of shielding gas, welding over surface films, and tack welds produce changes in what is otherwise a relatively uniform voltage signal. The arc voltage was 15 volts + or - 2 volts with 300 mV ripple noise from the power supply. Changes in this steady noise voltage varied from 50 mV to less than one millivolt depending on the severity {{and the type of}} change experienced. In some instances the changes were easily detected by analysis of the signal in real time, while in other cases the signal had to transformed to the frequency domain in order to detect the changes.

These two features and their influence on fracture have challenged the predictive capability of the conventional damage mechanics models. The present thesis contributes to the accurate fracture prediction of both high strength steel sheets and heavy plates by proposing a new generalised hybrid damage mechanics model. A dual-phase steel sheet (DP 600) and a high strength low <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> (S 355 J 2 +N), which show very different relation patterns between damage and fracture, are investigated. For both steels, an easy and systematic material parameter calibration procedure with different experiments is designed. Good prediction applying the model to Nakajima tests for the steel sheet and to bending tests for the heavy plate is achieved. This validates the generalised transferability and flexibility of the proposed model for high strength steels with complex damage-fracture relation under various stress states. As the model is formulated in a phenomenological sense, it also suffers from two drawbacks: having {{a large number of}} material parameters and a weak link to the material microstructure. Therefore, two approaches are provided to overcome these shortcomings: justified simplification of the model formulation for specific applications and linking the microstructure to the phenomenological material parameters by multiscale modelling...|$|R
