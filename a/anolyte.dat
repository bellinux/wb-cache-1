40|$|Vanilla {{is a very}} {{important}} flavouring agent, it is used as a major ingredient in a number of food products. The taste and aroma results from a specific blend of components present in the extract. There are over 170 volatile components, which all contribute to the flavour of the extract. These volatile components can be present in trace amounts or in relatively high concentrations. The range and concentration of volatile components is somewhat characteristic of the vanilla extract and its origin. Due to the high cost and low availability of natural extract, nature-identical and synthetic flavourings are often used to flavour foods and beverages. As natural extracts are very expensive, compared to nature-identical and synthetic vanilla flavourings, there have been many attempts to adulterate them. There are many different methods available for the characterisation of vanilla extracts. These include high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), gas chromatography (GC) and thin layer chromatography. However, traditional methods for the extraction of volatile components from non-volatile components for GC analysis, in particular, are time-consuming and prone to sample loss and degradation. Solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) is a relatively new separation technique, which can be used in conjunction with HPLC or GC. The <b>anolytes</b> can be extracted from a variety of matrices using a fused silica fibre exposed to the headspace of the sample. This provides a simple and effective technique for the selective extraction of volatile and semi-volatile components from a sample containing non-volatile components. A SPME-GC method was developed to extract and analyse a range of natural extracts, nature-identical extracts and synthetic flavourings. Using a polyacrylate (PA) fibre, the volatile components were extracted at room temperature. No sample preparation was required (other than dilution). The SPME-GC method was used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse a range of extracts and flavourings as well as food products. The method was also successfully compared to an existing HPLC method...|$|R
30|$|Antimicrobial {{activity}} E. coli O 157 :H 7 as {{a member}} of the enterohemorrhagic group of pathogenic bacteria frequently occurs as a foodborne and waterborne pathogen and is a major public health concern (Lee and Kang 2009). The present work devoted to the inactivation of the O 157 :H 7 strain of Escherichia coli showed that the treatment with electro-activated aqueous solutions of food grade organic salts is highly efficient under the conditions of the assay performed (Table  1). Moreover, the results showed that electro-activation of such solutions creates specific synergistic conditions with a stronger effect than conventional hurdle approaches used to ensure microbial food safety (Huang et al. 2008; Aider et al. 2012). Thus, it may be suggested that appropriate application of this treatment allows the reduction of 6 log CFU/ml of bacteria within 5  min contact time, especially when a combination treatment is used (Huang et al. 2008). Application of the organic acids in combination with different treatments like heat or salt has been commonly used to ensure the microbial safety of foods in many products. The combined treatment can result in additive results, such as additive, synergistic, and antagonistic effects (Lee and Kang 2009). However, although the organic acids are effective against different pathogens, they are usually supplied in a concentrated form. Thus, they must be handled with care to ensure adequate safety of the employees. Moreover, acids in strong concentration from should be used with high precaution because they may have undesirable effects on the sensory quality of the food product. Thus, it seems to be preferable to use low concentration of organic acid solutions during the combination treatment (Choi et al. 2009; Luttrell 2012). The <b>anolytes</b> of OSS during the EA treatment acquire important changes in properties which are able to disturb the bacteria homeostasis and act synergistically with heat or other hurdles (Liato et al. 2015 b). On one hand, the growth of micro-organisms is mostly dependent on the medium acidity; namely the solution pH and its titratable acidity which is a measure of all free and bond hydrogen ions available to maintain a buffering capacity of acidic solution. Moreover, the balance of oxidizing and reducing agents may significantly affect the environmental conditions in which the bacteria are growing. This parameter called the oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) of the solution is intensively studied and was used as effective parameter for microbial control and it is estimated as one of the crucial parameters for satisfactory biotic homeostasis (Lund and Wyatt 1984; Bagramyan et al. 2000). The creation of the adverse conditions through extreme values of the ORP requires the application of additional chemical agents which could be eliminated by using an electro-activation reactor (Aider et al. 2012). Moreover, the oxidative radicals generated by electro-activation is also considered as a source of the antimicrobial effect of electro-activated solutions. This particularity was successfully exploited for use forn food safety and in medicinal practice as preservative or desinfectant (Aider et al. 2012; Al-Haq and Gómez-López 2012; Gil et al. 2015). Related works on electro-activated solutions showed that the NaCl is the most utilised salt due to the generation of strong chlorine radicals (Liato et al. 2015 a). Its radical combinations resulting from electro-activation treatment were found to be more significant for microbial reduction in comparison with hydroxyl radicals (Hao et al. 2012). However hydroxyl radicals are the most reactive radicals and could be the principal starters of chlorine reactivity. Although this phenomenon creates adverse conditions for microorganisms growth, it could also be harmful for human. Thus, it is considered as undesirable agent for food preservation (Rico et al. 2007; Xiong et al. 2010). The oxygen species, pH and especially ORP are additional factors which influence the antimicrobial activity of EA solutions and explain the effectiveness of the electro-activation technology as strong desinfection tool (Kim et al. 2000; Liao et al. 2007). Thus, organic acids obtained by electro-activation of their conjugated salts, as inexpensive and environmentally friendly compounds, can be successfully used for food preservation.|$|R

This MV/TEMPO system has the highest cell voltage, 1.25 V, and, possibly, lowest capital cost ($180/kWh) reported for AORFBs. The water-based liquid electrolytes were designed as a drop-in replacement for current systems without replacing existing infrastructure.

More bacteria are resistant to moderate levels of biocides, with the bacteria in biofilms being the most difficult to control. High levels of biocides are used and this has detrimental effects on the environment, as biocides are toxic to humans, being carcinogenic, corrosive and producing intolerable odours. Electrochemical activation technology provides an alternative way of controlling microorganisms. ECA water was shown in other countries to have antimicrobial properties. <b>Anolyte,</b> the positively charged solution is benign to fumes and corrosion caused by other biocides.

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of <b>anolyte</b> and its antimicrobial properties against different microorganisms in suspension was evaluated. The I: 1 0 and neat <b>anolyte</b> gave a 100 % kill of all organisms tested while 1 : 20 dilution gave variable killing percentages ranging from 31 % to 100 %. Minimum inhibitory concentration was found to be 20 % for most Gram positives and 50 % for most Gram negatives. <b>Anolyte</b> did have some antimicrobial properties with MIC differing amongst different organisms.

In this study, the effect of electrically activated sodium bicarbonate and non-ionized sodium bicarbonate solutions on productivity and postharvest quality of hydroponically grown tomatoes was tested. Sodium bicarbonate is a ready source of bicarbonate. By using a novel technique obtained from Radical Waters (Pty) Ltd., ionized bicarbonate (<b>anolyte)</b> can be produced from sodium bicarbonate and applied to plants to stimulate photosynthesis, and improve yield and postharvest quality. The effect of ionized and non-ionized bicarbonate solutions on productivity and postharvest quality was studied by measuring the following: (1) Preharvest growth rate (leaf length, stem height and diameter); total yield; starch concentration in leaves; fruit count; leaf chlorophyll content; CO 2 -uptake; soluble solids and concentration of K+, Na+ and NO 3 ¯ in leaves. (2) Postharvest rate of respiration and transpiration; ethylene production; total soluble solids content; ascorbic acid content; pH; fruit firmness; fruit mass; fruit diameter; longevity; concentration of K+, Na+ and NO 3 ¯ at one-third towards maturity, two-thirds towards maturity, at maturity and during ripening, and rate of ripening at 12 and 23 °C. During the preharvest period, plants treated with <b>anolyte</b> showed increased growth rate, starch concentration, chlorophyll content, soluble solids content and improved yield. During the growth period, the concentration of K+ and NO 3 ¯ was higher in plants treated with <b>anolyte</b> than in plants treated with non-ionized sodium bicarbonate. The concentration of Na+ during the preharvest period was higher in plants treated with non-ionized sodium bicarbonate than in plants treated with <b>anolyte.</b> After harvest, fruits from plants treated with <b>anolyte</b> had a reduced rate of ethylene production, rate of respiration and transpiration, total increased soluble solids and ascorbic acid content than fruits from plants treated with non-ionized sodium bicarbonate. Fruits from plants treated with <b>anolyte</b> had reduced rate of ripening and were larger and heavier than fruits from plants treated with non-ionized sodium bicarbonate. Anatomical and ultrastructural studies revealed that treatment with <b>anolyte</b> stimulated cell growth and photosynthesis. These results were confirmed by comparing the CO 2 -uptake of treated and untreated plants. Application of <b>anolyte</b> stimulated photosynthesis, thus improving yield and fruit quality. Treatment with non-ionized sodium bicarbonate resulted in salt- stress and calcium deficiency. Some of the fruits on plants treated with non-ionized sodium bicarbonate suffered from blossom-end rot due to salt-stress. Prof. C. S. Whitehea...|$|E

Šio darbo tikslas – įvertinti elektrochemiškai aktyvuoto tirpalo – neutralaus anolito ANK – dezinfekuojamąsias savybes laboratorinėmis ir gamybinėmis sąlygomis sanitariškai apdorojant melžimo įrenginius. Įvertinus įrenginyje STEL- 10 N- 120 - 01 pagamintą 0, 05 proc. koncentracijos neutralų anolitą (ANK) nustatyta, kad šis tirpalas slopino Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Salmonella {{enteritis}} ir Klebsiella bakterijų augimą. Melžimo įrenginius dezinfekuojant ir neutraliu anolitu (ANK), ir šarminiu tirpalu prieš praplaunant vandeniu, mikroorganizmai neaugo. Praplovus vandeniu pieno kolboje ir kolektoriuje mikroorganizmų rasta (p > 0, 05). Po plovimo vandeniu naudojant anolitą (ANK), inhibitorinių medžiagų vandenyje nenustatyta, o naudojant šarminį tirpalą – nustatyta. Melžimo įrenginius galime dezinfekuoti anolitu (ANK), tik labai svarbu, kad naudojamas vanduo atitiktų Geriamo vandens higienos norma.

40|$|At {{the time}} there are various options {{in the range of}} {{disinfecting}} materials applied in animal husbandry. In animal husbandry and food processing industry a new type of biocide – neutral <b>anolyte</b> (ANK) has been used for the purposes of disinfection, presterilization, purification and sterilization. ANK is produced in the STEL devices by electrochemical activation of sodium chloride solution. Aim of the study: to evaluate (under the laboratory conditions) the antibacterial washing qualities of neutral <b>anolyte</b> ANK, produced in the STEL- 10 N- 120 - 01 devices, in its application for washing and disinfecting milking equipment and parlours. The efficiency of disinfection was estimated applying the method of pads (LAST EN ISO 4833 : 2003). Inhabitable materials in the water were identified using “Delves” test, according to the standard LST 1263 : 1999. The physical-chemical examinations of water were carried (HN 24 : 2003). Under the laboratory conditions, <b>anolyte</b> ANK (produced in the STEL- 10 N- 120 - 01 devices) solution with the concentration of 0. 05 % suppressed the increase of the Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Salmonella and the coliform bacteria. The <b>anolyte</b> ANK solutions with the concentration 0. 05 % and 0. 025 % (made from the 0. 05 % solution watering it down in proportion 1 : 1) were not efficient in the pig farm A.

40|$|A temperature- and {{time-dependent}} {{mathematical model}} for the operation of a laboratory-scale copper electrowinning cell based on reactive electrodialysis (RED) has been developed. The model is zero-dimensional. The cathodic reaction was copper electrodeposition and the anodic reaction was ferrous to ferric ion oxidation. The catholyte was aqueous cupric sulphate and the <b>anolyte</b> was aqueous ferrous sulphate, both in sulphuric acid. Catholyte and <b>anolyte</b> were separated by an electrodialytic anion membrane. The model predicts the effect of temperature and time on: (a) cathodic and anodic kinetics, (b) speciation of catholyte and <b>anolyte,</b> (c) transport phenomena in the electrolytes and (d) ion transport through the membrane. Model calibration and validation were carried out. Its predictions are in good agreement with experiments for: amount of deposited copper, amount of produced Fe(III) species, cell voltage and specific energy consumption...|$|E
