Waters told the Associated Press that The Wall Tour will likely be his last, stating: [...] "I'm not as young <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be. I'm not like B.B. King, or Muddy Waters. I'm not a great vocalist or a great instrumentalist or whatever, but I still have the fire in my belly, and I have something to say. I have a swan song in me and I think this will probably be it." [...] At The O2 Arena in London on 12 May 2011, Gilmour and Mason once again appeared with Waters and Gilmour performing [...] "Comfortably Numb", and Gilmour and Mason joining Waters for [...] "Outside the Wall". For the first half of 2012, Waters' tour topped worldwide concert ticket sales having sold more than 1.4 million tickets globally. As of 2013, The Wall Live is the highest-grossing tour of all time by a solo artist. Waters performed at [...] at Madison Square Garden on 12 December 2012. On 24 July 2015, Waters headlined the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, Rhode Island. Waters was accompanied by the band My Morning Jacket and two singers from the group Lucius.|$|E
500|$|On 17 June 1947, {{serialisation}} of {{the story}} paused after Hergé disappeared. Doctors diagnosed him as suffering from a mental breakdown {{as a result of}} overwork, and to recover he spent time in retreat at the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de-Scourmont. In a letter to his wife Germaine, Hergé wrote, [...] "Life has spoilt me... I no longer draw like I breathe, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> not so long ago. Tintin is no longer me... my Boy Scout spirit has been badly damaged." [...] He followed this with a holiday to Gland on Lake Geneva, Switzerland with Germaine. Editors of Tintin magazine posted a sarcastic notice in the magazine stating that [...] "Our friend Hergé is in need of a rest. Oh, don't worry, he's fine. But in refusing to marshal his forces to bring you a new episode of The Temple of the Sun each week, our friend is a little over-worked." [...] He disappeared again in early 1948, this time for six weeks, again to Gland, but according to biographer Pierre Assouline he was accompanied by a young, married woman, with whom he was having an extra-marital affair. Angered by his absence, the editorial board decided to command other artists and writers to continue the story, a threat which made Hergé return to work.|$|E

Magazine, {{in regard to}} the fact that he recently called his fifty-state project a joke, that [...] "I don't really have as much faith in my work <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> but I think that's healthy.

2500|$|The album's themes include {{mortality}} and growing older, or, as Taylor described it, [...] "just realizing, 'I'm not as young <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be, what am I {{going to do}} with myself? I don't have eternity to stay here so I need to get up and do something and make it worthwhile'—whatever that means." [...] Pierre's lyricism includes a mix of fact and fiction, which is intended to leave the listener guessing. The album's tone is reflective, which was spurred from Pierre having time to sit at home to write and think. He looked at his relationship with lead guitarist Joshua Cain, noting that the two had written and played music together for 15 years at that point. Pierre felt [...] "overwhelmed with the eventual demise of everything," [...] and considered the fact that [...] "nothing lasts forever" [...] is one of the album's most important points. Occasionally, Pierre's lyricism was considered too personal or dark by other members. One lyric from [...] "Timelines", paraphrased by Pierre in an interview as [...] "rushing into every pore, the whiskey stench of open sores", was changed to [...] "scattered seeds of sycamore," [...] as Cain found the lyric gross, noting it [...] "literally made [...] stomach sick." ...|$|E
