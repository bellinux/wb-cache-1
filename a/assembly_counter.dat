5000|$|On 30 August 1868, Abraham Schag-Zwabner, one of {{the oldest}} and most senior rabbis in Hungary, {{circulated}} a letter in which he demanded to convene a rabbinical <b>assembly</b> to <b>counter</b> the threat of the Congress; he protested the Guardians of the Faith were never accepted by all as representatives. The latter quickly obliged. The elections for the Congress were held on 18 November; on the 24th, some 200 Orthodox rabbis met in Pesth, accompanied by many activists. Benjamin Sofer was elected president. The assembly was short and tumultuous, ending on 3 December. Hildesheimer again tried to promote the seminary. When his motion was rejected without he could present it properly, he and some of his supporters withdrew in protest. Another crisis erupted due to Rebbe Friedmann's insistence of opposing secular education. Eventually, the assembled decided to pursue [...] "simultaneous education", sending children to all-Hungarian schools and in later hours to a private Cheder, rather than to support Jewish public schools. The more conservative accepted this, preferring to have gentile teachers rather than Neolog or enlightened Jewish ones, who might turn the pupils away from observance. During the assembly, the elections' results were published. Of 220 delegates, only 94 were considered conservative, and merely 80 were [...] "certainly" [...] Orthodox. As even Hildesheimer could not be relied upon, the Orthodox deduced that any hope to achieve a majority was lost. In spite of fearing to antagonize the authorities, they determined to send the government a declaration that the traditionalists will not accept the Congress' decisions unless they would conform to the laws of religion as interpreted by their rabbis. It was Rabbi Moshe Schick of Huszt, who held no official position, who was the decisive factor in choosing this policy. From that moment he became the de facto leader of the Orthodox, and cooperated closely with Krausz.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{accelerating}} gradients of 15 - 25 MV/m with the superconducting cavi-ties in the TESLA Test Facility, considerable effort is put into preparing the cavities and the auxiliary components to avoid field emission due to particle contamination. The particle cleanliness has to be preserved throughout the whole assembly procedure of the cavities. Most crucial is the mounting of the flange connections which have to be UHV-leaktight with the cavities immersed in superfluid helium. In the present design, the niobium cavities are fabricated with Nb sealing surfaces with a thickness of 3 mm. Split stainless steel rings and spring-type gaskets (Helicoflex) are used to provide UHV-tight connections to the stainless steel counter flanges. This design has several disadvantages. The gaskets can not be prop-erly made “particle-free ” and {{the handling of the}} split flanges may contaminate the cavities during assembly. Moreover, the sealing surfaces of the Nb cavities get quite soft during the 1400 ˚C heat treatment, which often results in leak problems due to plastic deformations. An alternative approach are NbTi-flanges directly welded to the Nb cavities. They should allow an easier <b>assembly</b> of the <b>counter</b> flanges. Various types of spring-less gaskets are under investigation and the results will be presented. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{desire to}} conquer markets through {{advanced}} product design and trendy business strategies are still predominant approaches in industry today. In fact, product development has acquired {{an ever more}} {{central role in the}} strategic planning of companies, and it has extended its influence to R&D funding levels as well. It is not surprising that many national R&D project frameworks within the EU today are dominated by product development topics, leaving production engineering, robotics, and systems on the sidelines. The reasons may be many but, unfortunately, the link between product development and the production processes they cater for are seldom treated in depth. The issue dealt with in this article relates to how product development is applied in order to attain the required production quality levels a company may desire, as well as how one may <b>counter</b> <b>assembly</b> defects and deviations through quantifiable design approaches. It is recognized that product verifications (tests, inspections, etc.) are necessary, but the application of these tactics often result in lead-time extensions and increased costs. Modular architectures improve this by simplifying the verification of the assembled product at module level. Furthermore, since Design for Assembly (DFA) has shown the possibility to identify defective assemblies, {{it may be possible to}} detect potential assembly defects already in the product and module design phase. The intention of this paper is to discuss and describe the link between verifications of modular architectures, defects and design for assembly. The paper is based on literature and case studies; tables and diagrams are included with the intention of increasing understanding of the relation between poor designs, defects and product verifications...|$|R
40|$|The Detector for Advanced Neutron Capture Experiments (DANCE) {{consists}} of 160 BF{sub 2 } crystals with equal solid-angle coverage. DANCE is a 4 {pi} {gamma}-ray calorimeter {{and designed to}} study the neutron-capture reactions on small quantities of radioactive and rare stable nuclei. These reactions are important for the radiochemistry applications and modeling the element production in stars. The recognition of capture event is made by the summed {gamma}-ray energy which is equivalent of the reaction Q-value and unique for a given capture reaction. For a selective group of actinides, where the neutron-induced fission reaction competes favorably with the neutron capture reaction, additional signature is needed to distinguish between fission and capture {gamma} rays for the DANCE measurement. This {{can be accomplished by}} introducing a detector system to tag fission fragments and thus establish a unique signature for the fission event. Once this system is implemented, one has the opportunity to study not only the capture but also fission reactions. A parallel-plate avalanche counter (PPAC) has many advantages for the detection of heavy charged particles such as fission fragments. These include fast timing, resistance to radiation damage, and tolerance of high counting rate. A PPAC also can be tuned to be insensitive to {alpha} particles, which is important for experiments with {alpha}-emitting actinides. Therefore, a PPAC is an ideal detector for experiments requiring a fast and clean trigger for fission. A PPAC with an ingenious design was fabricated in 2006 by integrating amplifiers into the target <b>assembly.</b> However, this <b>counter</b> was proved to be unsuitable for this application because of issues related to the stability of amplifiers and the ability to separate fission fragments from {alpha}'s. Therefore, a new design is needed. A LLNL proposal to develop a new PPAC for DANCE was funded by NA 22 in FY 09. The design goal is to minimize the mass for the proposed counter and still be able to maintain a stable operation under extreme radioactivity and the ability to separate fission fragments from {alpha}'s. In the following sections, the description is given for the design and performance of this new compact PPAC, for studying the neutron-induced reactions on actinides using DANCE at LANL...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringDouglas S. McGregorFission {{chambers}} {{are ideal}} neutron flux surveillance instruments to ensure nuclear reactor control and safety. They can provide online, in-core, real-time measurements covering the dynamic range of neutron flux including pulse, Campbell, and current mode over decades of reactor operation cycles. The first patented fission chamber {{was developed by}} Baer et al. in 1957. It was a cylindrical <b>assembly</b> thermal fission <b>counter</b> having sensitivity of 0. 7 count/neutron cm⁻² for a background measurement of 5 counts/second with ability to operate at a temperature range of 20 - 80 ºC [3]. Since then, fission chamber technology was developed {{to come up with}} miniature and sub-miniature dimensions withstanding high irradiation and high temperature environment making them suitable for in-core online diagnosis. Since the introduction of high temperature fission chamber technology starting in the 1970 ’s, the need of the advancement in modeling of the fission chambers to improve their performance has become important. The development of modeling depends upon the understanding and consideration of underlying physics of these detectors. The validation of modeling of fission chambers will need the quantification of uncertainty introduced at every stage from neutron-deposit interaction to signal shaping. Based on this objective, a detailed review was performed on fission chamber modeling and simulation covering neutron flux self-shielding, fissile deposit evolution, fission product emission, auto-absorption, electron-ion pair creation, charge recombination and avalanche, space charge effect, charge transport, propagation of electronic pulse and pulse shaping. The analytical methods, algorithmic treatments, simulation, and computation codes used so far in case of modeling different aspects of fission chambers were reviewed. Along with the numerical methods and computer codes for simulating electron drift and charge transport for the usual gas chamber detectors, the use of several fissile material evolution techniques and computation codes were observed in case of fission chamber modeling. The use higher order statistics to handle fluctuation mode and to treat noisy data were observed. In recent years, fission chamber modeling made reasonable improvement in detail physics modeling. Several analytical methods like advanced statistics for Campbellng mode and electric field distortion due to space charge effect need to be incorporated in computation codes. More progress in the areas of evolution of gas behavior, consideration of Penning, recombination, and avalanche effect still needed...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The use of {{radioactive}} isotopes as tracers in biological systems has become widespread since {{the close of}} World War II. Proper use of radiotracers requires a fundamental understanding of the physical nature of radioactivity, the characteristics of ionizing radiation, and the various methods available for measuring radioactivity. More importantly, the investigator employing radioisotopic tracers must {{be familiar with the}} methodology involved in design of radio-tracer experiments, the preparation {{of radioactive}} samples for assay, and the problems inherent in analyzing data from radiotracer experiments. The purpose in the preparation of this thesis was to present a summary of the essential concepts and information needed by the biologist who desires to make use of radiotracer methods in his investigations. The thesis is set forth {{in the form of an}} introductory text, suitable either for class or individual use. The presentation is divided into three major sections (1) the text proper, covering the principles of radiotracer methodology, (2) a set of basic laboratory exercises, intended to familiarize the user with procedures in detecting and characterizing radioactivity, and (3) a selection of typical radiotracer experiments illustrating applications in various fields of biological science. This latter section is thought to be particularly valuable in that it furnishes step-by-step examples of design and execution of typical radiotracer experiments In view of the fact that liquid scintillation counting has recently come into widespread favor among biologists using tritium and carbon- 14 labeled tracer compounds and yet no comprehensive monograph is available on the subject, particular attention has been devoted to this assay method. A most extensive bibliography covering both the preparation of samples for liquid scintillation counting and the operating characteristics of the <b>counter</b> <b>assembly</b> is included. In addition, one of the laboratory exercises deals with the practical operation of a liquid scintillation counter Other aspects of radiotracer methodology that are treated are the safe handling of radioisotopes, the proper design of radiotracer laboratory facilities, and the statistical analysis of counting data. Since the biologist commonly secures his radiotracer compounds from commercial radiochemical. suppliers, a chapter on the methods of primary radioisotope production and the preparation of labeled compounds has been included as background information. The recently popular technique of tritium labeling by gas-exposure (the Wilzbach method) has also been discussed in this connection. Although the emphasis in this presentation has been restricted primarily to the application of radiotracers to research in the biological sciences, the coverage is broad enough to be of value to investigators in other fields...|$|R
