5000|$|A {{network diagram}} {{can be created}} by hand or by using diagram software. There {{are two types of}} network diagrams, {{activity}} on arrow (AOA) and <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> <b>node</b> (AON). <b>Activity</b> <b>on</b> <b>node</b> diagrams are generally easier to create and interpret. To create an AON diagram, it is recommended (but not required) to start with a node named start. This [...] has a duration of zero (0). Then you draw each activity that does not have a predecessor activity (a and b in this example) and connect them with an arrow from start to each node. Next, since both c and d list a as a predecessor activity, their nodes are drawn with arrows coming from a. Activity e is listed with b and c as predecessor activities, so node e is drawn with arrows coming from both b and c, signifying that e cannot begin until both b and c have been completed. Activity f has d as a predecessor activity, so an arrow is drawn connecting the activities. Likewise, an arrow is drawn from e to g. Since there are no activities that come after f or g, it is recommended (but again not required) to connect them to a node labeled finish.|$|E
40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{are widely}} adopted for {{applications}} ranging from surveillance to environmental monitoring. While powerful and relatively inexpensive, they {{are subject to}} behavioural faults which make them unreliable. Due to the complex interactions between network nodes, it is difficult to uncover faults in a WSN by resorting to formal techniques for verification and analysis, or to testing. This paper proposes an evolutionary framework to detect anomalous behaviour related to energy consumption in WSN routing protocols. Given a collection protocol, the framework creates candidate topologies and evaluates them through simulation on the basis of metrics measuring the radio <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> <b>nodes.</b> Experimental results using the standard Collection Tree Protocol show that the proposed approach is able to unveil topologies plagued by excessive energy depletion over one or more nodes, and thus could be used as an offline debugging tool to understand and correct the issues before network deployment and during the development of new protocol...|$|R
30|$|We use the {{extracted}} job hops and the normalized job titles to form our talent flow network. A talent flow {{network is}} a directed graph where each edge represents a job hop <b>activity.</b> Based <b>on</b> <b>node</b> {{type in the}} network, talent flow network can be classified into two types: (1) job network, where each node v_t,i represents a canonical job title t in industry i, and (2) organization network, where each node v_c represents an organization c. Job network allows us to observe talent flow at job level, whereas organization network allows us to observe talent flow at organization level.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Replication of data is {{a common}} {{technique}} to enhance performance in distributed systems in which multiple activities use shared passive objects. If replicated data is updateable rather than read-only, modifications must be propagated to other copies of the replicated data in order to assure a consistent view. The delay of update propagations affects the observations of <b>activities</b> running <b>on</b> the different <b>nodes</b> of a distributed system. Read operations on the same passive object may return different values depending <b>on</b> the <b>nodes</b> they are executed on and the replica being accessed. A memory consistency model defines the legal ordering of data modifications issued by an <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> a <b>node</b> of the distributed system, as observed by remote activities. This paper presents a formal {{definition of the term}} data consistency using an event lattice model. With this definition the consistency of an arbitrary execution of a concurrent system can be determined...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{performance}} of parallel applications running on large clusters {{is known to}} degrade due to the interference of kernel and dae-mon <b>activities</b> <b>on</b> individual <b>nodes,</b> {{often referred to as}} noise. In this paper, we focus on an important class of parallel applications, which re-peatedly perform computation, followed by a collective operation such as a barrier. We model this theoretically and demonstrate, in a rigor-ous way, the effect of noise on the scalability of such applications. We study three natural and important classes of noise distributions: The ex-ponential distribution, the heavy-tailed distribution, and the Bernoulli distribution. We show that the systems scale well in the presence of expo-nential noise, but the performance goes down drastically in the presence of heavy-tailed of Bernoulli noise. ...|$|R

40|$|By injecting 131 I-Lipiodol into lymphatics of the dorsum of dog feet, the {{distribution}} of 13 JI in the lymph nodes and other principal organs {{as well as its}} histological effect were studied periodically after the injection for the period of two months. The characteristic feature of J 3 JI distribution was the fact that J 31 I was accumulated into lymph nodes markedly higher than in any other organs and it was retained there {{over a long period of}} time. Histological examinations of the lymph nodes revealed a marked lymphocytopenia, the loss of germinal center, practically complete loss of lymphoid elements already 5 days after injection, and marked fibrosis. In the lung a considerable J 3 JI·distribution could be seen in early stage:, but with lapse of time it decreased rapidly. The distribution in other organs such as liver, spleen, bone marrow, kidney, ureter, bladder, thyroid gland, pancreas, testicles and small and large intestines was negligible in amount, and any specific histologic effect of irradiation could not be recognized in these organs including the lung. From these results, the authors concluded that 131 I-Lipiodol has a selective <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> lymph <b>nodes</b> by injecting it via lymphatics and it is a safe method in clinical application to treat the patients bearing malignant lymphoma or metastatic lymph nodes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{transmitter}} energy {{is one of}} the major factors of total energy dissipation in a sensor node, neglecting the overhead energy in energy aware routing decisions could result in suboptimal energy usage. Routing algorithms should be concerned about the overhead energy which is wasted at each hop of data transfer. When only the transmission energy is considered as the communication cost, using shorter multi-hop links seems to be more advantageous. However, due to other energy consuming <b>activities</b> <b>on</b> the sensor <b>nodes,</b> such as reception of relayed messages, sensing and computation tasks, a considerable overhead energy might be dissipated while forwarding a message. Therefore, multi-hopping becomes not always advantageous in wireless sensor networks. In this work, we investigate the use of multi-hop communication links and compare the amount of energy gain acquired by correct routing energy calculations. We show that neglecting the overhead energy and overemphasizing the importance of power adjustable transmitter circuitry could result in considerable energy loss. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} two specific crime types, {{violence against}} the person and criminal damage that occur at activity nodes near alcohol supply points. These are defined as premises licensed to sell alcohol for on site and or off site consumption. A conjunctive analysis method is used (Meithe et al, 2008; Hart and Miethe, 2014) to examine the following question. What specific configurations of licensed premise types influence risk of these crime types (bar; nightclub; off license; supermarket; restaurant; takeaway/fast food; hotel; members club); what {{is the impact of}} density of premise and size of premises at these <b>activity</b> <b>nodes</b> <b>on</b> the above configurations; and what are the prevention implications of the findings. Truth tables reveal particular combinations of premise type and densities account for large proportion of crimes, and suggest targeting resources in these areas would be most beneficial for crime reduction. This advantage of this approach for examining the relationship between land use and crime, compared to regression analysis, is also highlighted...|$|R

40|$|This {{tutorial}} is formatted as {{a half-day}} tutorial. It covers a methodology to profile {{and measure the}} energy consumption of applications running on an embedded sensor network environment, using TinyOS as an example setting. We use the iCount energy metering hardware [1], together with the Quanto framework [3], to provide a breakdown of energy consumption over time by hardware component and by activity. Activities are sets of operations meaningful to the programmer, such as sending a packet, reading a sensor, or storing data to Flash. Quanto is able to track the energy that system and hardware components spend on behalf of high level activities, even across network nodes. We present the methodology, and using a hands-on approach, will cover how application programmers can instrument their applications {{to take advantage of}} Quanto/iCount, and how they can use software tools to collect and interpret the results. We will also cover how system programmers can instrument system components and device drivers to integrate with the framework. Each participant {{will be able to use}} one provided Quanto Testbed Mote, pictured below [2], equipped with iCount and programmable over the network.
