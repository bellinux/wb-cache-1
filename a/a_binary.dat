5|$|<b>A</b> <b>binary</b> {{search tree}} is <b>a</b> <b>binary</b> tree data {{structure}} that works {{based on the}} principle of binary search. The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to binary search, taking on average logarithmic time. Insertion and deletion also require on average logarithmic time in binary search trees. This can faster than the linear time insertion and deletion of sorted arrays, and binary trees retain the ability to perform all the operations possible on a sorted array, including range and approximate queries.|$|E

5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually <b>a</b> <b>binary</b> star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. If this is the case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system {{would have to have}} a mass that is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. A search for <b>a</b> <b>binary</b> companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Let us {{say that}} <b>an</b> {{infinite}} <b>binary</b> sequence q lies above <b>an</b> infinite <b>binary</b> sequence p if q {{can be obtained}} from p by replacing selected 0 ’s in p by 1 ’s. We show that above any infinite binary Martin-Löf random sequence p there exists <b>an</b> infinite <b>binary</b> nonrandom sequence q above which there exists <b>an</b> infinite <b>binary</b> random sequence r. This result is of interest especially in connection with the new randomness notion for sets of natural numbers introduced in [Hertling and Weihrauch 1998, Hertling and Weihrauch 2003] and in connection with its relation to the Martin-Löf randomness notion for infinite binary sequences...|$|R

5|$|The {{two stars}} in Serpens Caput that {{form part of}} the Snake's body below the heart are Epsilon and Mu Serpentis, both third-magnitude A-type main-sequence stars. Both have a peculiarity: Epsilon is an Am star, while Mu is <b>a</b> <b>binary.</b> Located {{slightly}} northwest of Mu is 36 Serpentis, another A-type main-sequence star. This star also has a peculiarity; it is <b>a</b> <b>binary</b> with the primary component being a Lambda Boötis star, meaning that it has solar-like amounts of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, while containing very low amounts of iron peak elements. 25 Serpentis, positioned a few degrees northeast of Mu Serpentis, is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a hot B-type giant and an A-type main-sequence star. The primary is a slowly pulsating B star, which causes the system to vary by 0.03 magnitudes.|$|E
5|$|Using {{a program}} called Blendanal, similar to the Blender {{technique}} used to verify the planets discovered by Kepler, the astronomers observing HAT-P-33 hoped to rule out false positive alternatives that could explain the planet-like signal seen in HAT-P-33's light curve and radial velocity. The use of Blendanal ruled out the possibilities that the signal was caused by that of a hierarchical triple star or a mixture between a bright star and <b>a</b> <b>binary</b> star in the background. The possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually <b>a</b> <b>binary</b> star whose secondary companion is too dim to be distinguishable from the brighter star could not be ruled out. However, the data indicated that the planet HAT-P-33b did indeed exist.|$|E

50|$|A common {{envelope}} {{is sometimes}} confused with <b>a</b> contact <b>binary.</b> In <b>a</b> common envelope <b>binary</b> system the envelope does not generally rotate {{at the same}} rate as the embedded binary system; thus it is not constrained by the equipotential surface passing through the L2 Lagrangian point.

5|$|A {{group is}} a {{mathematical}} structure consisting {{of a set of}} objects together with <b>a</b> <b>binary</b> operation, that is, an operation combining any two objects to a third, subject to certain requirements. A group in which the objects are matrices and the group operation is matrix multiplication is called a matrix group.

5|$|A multi-star system {{consists}} {{of two or more}} gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star system is <b>a</b> <b>binary</b> star, but systems of three or more stars are also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit their host galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{observations}} using {{adaptive optics}} in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double {{peak in the}} brightness of the nucleus, controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by <b>a</b> <b>binary</b> nucleus. The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations. Also, while comets have been observed to break up before, no case has previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given the very small mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun and planets.|$|E

5|$|Examination of the spectrographic {{features}} of this star showed the characteristic absorption line shift of <b>a</b> <b>binary</b> star system.
