5|$|Ants first arose {{during the}} mid-Cretaceous, more than 100 million years ago, {{associated}} {{with the rise of}} flowering plants and an increase in forest ground litter. The earliest known ants evolved from a lineage within the aculeate wasps, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> study suggests that they are a sister group of Apoidea. During the Cretaceous ants were confined to the northern Laurasian supercontinent, with only a few widespread primitive species. By the middle Eocene, around 50 million years ago, ants had diversified and become ecologically dominant as predators and scavengers. Ant species are less than 2% {{of the total number of}} insect species but make up one third of the insect biomass.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} pyjama shark as Near Threatened, citing its small {{distribution}} <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> increase in fishing pressure on small sharks in the region. However, {{there is no}} evidence to suggest that its population has declined. There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species, though its range encompasses two marine reserves. The South African Sea Fisheries Research Institute is considering legally decommercializing the pyjama shark, which would limit the degree to which it can be targeted by commercial fisheries.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally {{the work}} was {{ascribed}} to either Thomas or Richard, two monks of Ely mentioned in the text.

Blake thinks that Richard was the author, but he considers the evidence to be inconclusive. Janet Fairweather, a classicist <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> translator of the Liber, suggests that it may have been written by someone other than the traditional candidates.

25|$|The {{bacterium}} {{is found}} naturally in fresh water. It can contaminate hot water tanks, hot tubs, and cooling towers of large air conditioners.

Risk factors for infection include older age, history of smoking, chronic lung disease, and poor immune function. It is recommended that those with severe pneumonia and those with pneumonia <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> travel history be tested for the disease. Diagnosis is by a urinary antigen test and sputum culture.|$|E
