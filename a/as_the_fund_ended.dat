However, such sites may become outdated <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> <b>ends,</b> but yet in many cases, still publicly available through the Internet. The issue of website sustainability is a relevant topic for all organizations that have websites. Website lifecycle, knowledge management, and website sustainability issues are discussed through a theoretical-based literature review. These issues are then summarized and used as lessons learned for the case study approach of this paper. The aim is to identify a solution to address a website’s life and longevity, post project. A practical case study assessment {{of the issue of}} project website sustainability is needed to address the website’s longevity—post project—as creation is often made through temporary endeavors. Recommendations for future project websites are made <b>as</b> <b>the</b> outcomes and results of this study and are expressed in the form of suggested practices for project website sustainability in future projects...|$|R

50|$|In 1929, <b>the</b> Rosenwald <b>Fund</b> funded a {{syphilis}} treatment {{pilot program}} in five Southern states. The Rosenwald project emphasized locating people with syphilis and treating them, {{during a time}} when syphilis was widespread in poor African-American communities. <b>The</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>ended</b> its involvement in 1932, due to lack of matching state <b>funds</b> (<b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> required jurisdictions to contribute to efforts to increase collaboration on solving problems). After <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> ceased its involvement, the federal government decided to take over <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> and changed its mission to being a non-therapeutic study. The infamous Tuskegee syphilis study began later that year, tracking the progress of untreated disease, and took advantage of poor participants by not informing them fully of its constraints. Even after penicillin became recognized as approved treatment for this disease, researchers did not treat the study participants.|$|R
40|$|The {{extent to}} which project {{outcomes}} are sustained years after development projects have ended is not routinely investigated. This study assessed the long-term impacts of a fire management project in eastern Indonesia seven years after <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> <b>ended.</b> Post-project evaluation increased understanding of the factors determining sustainability of project outcomes and links to development impacts. The continuation of community fire management and agroforestry groups was linked to demonstration of benefits to farmers and multi-level engagement. Activities had ceased where ownership was disputed. Some long-term impacts were outside the original aims of the fire project, including district government agencies applying fire mapping skills to other development issues...|$|R

As a result of a state {{constitutional}} amendment to build a high speed rail system between its 5 largest cities passed by voters in 2000, construction projects on I-4 included a wide median to accommodate a high speed rail line. The high speed rail project was cancelled in 2004, but revived again in 2009. In 2010, the federal government awarded Florida over $2 billion—nearly the entire projected construction cost—to build the line, with work on the project to begin in 2011 and be completed by 2014.
