5|$|Sherman's {{greatest}} {{contribution to}} the war, the strategy of total warfare—endorsed by General Grant and President Lincoln—has {{been the subject of}} controversy. Sherman himself downplayed his role in conducting total war, often saying that he was simply carrying out orders <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> in order to fulfill his part of Grant's master plan for ending the war.|$|E
5|$|When the ice {{finally brought}} the camp {{to the edge}} of the pack ice, Shackleton decided that the three boats, the James Caird, Stancomb Wills, and Dudley Docker, should make {{initially}} for Elephant Island. McNish had prepared the boats <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> for a long journey in the open ocean, building up their sides to give them a higher clearance from the water.|$|E
5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E
50|$|The book 'The Solimanian Family' depicts Mohamed Mahmoud Pacha's life in office, his {{relations}} to the British royal family, and his commitments to serve Egypt <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
50|$|In June 2012, Turner {{was cast}} {{for the lead}} role of a John Boorman film Queen and Country. Turner stated that Boorman {{revealed}} secrets and very personal events from his life, in order for Turner to portray him <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
25|$|At that time, Great Britain and Spain were at war, {{creating}} {{the risk of}} an attack on Buenos Aires. He requested help from the Spanish Courts, but the Prime Minister Manuel Godoy answered that <b>he</b> should defend <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> with no help forthcoming.|$|R
5|$|As {{military}} governor, Johnson {{sought to}} eliminate rebel {{influence in the}} state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and {{the ebb and flow}} of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Relief from Union regulars did not come until William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.|$|E
5|$|In this {{relatively}} liberal environment Jan accompanied the servants in their work, {{listening to their}} stories, learning {{the ways of the}} countryside, and trying to help <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> As his knowledge and confidence increased Jan began {{to go out into the}} countryside by himself, exploring the hills and valleys which surrounded him. Later, as an older boy, his chief responsibility was as a herd — first of the pigs and poultry in the farmyard, and later of the cattle out on the veld. The same laws of custom which had preordained Jan's role as a farmer also had their beneficial aspect; Boer farmers customarily allotted their sons a share of the natural increase of the beasts under their care. As time passed Jan gradually built up a respectable holding of livestock.|$|E
5|$|July 9, 1861 {{was a hot}} day, and Fanny {{was putting}} locks of her children's hair into an {{envelope}} and attempting to seal it with hot sealing wax while Longfellow took a nap. Her dress suddenly caught fire, though it is unclear exactly how; burning wax or a lighted candle may have fallen onto it. Longfellow was awakened from his nap and rushed to help her, throwing a rug over her, though it was too small. He stifled the flames with his body <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> but she was already badly burned. Over half a century later, Longfellow's youngest daughter Annie explained the story differently, claiming {{that there had been}} no candle or wax but that the fire had started from a self-lighting match that had fallen on the floor. Both accounts state that Fanny was taken to her room to recover and a doctor was called. She {{was in and out of}} consciousness throughout the night and was administered ether. She died shortly after 10:00 the next morning, July 10, after requesting a cup of coffee. Longfellow, in trying to save her, had burned himself badly enough so that he was unable to attend her funeral. His facial injuries led him to stop shaving, and he wore a beard from then on that became his trademark.|$|E

50|$|Portugal had become, as a consequence, a Kingdom {{ruled by}} King Philip II of Spain, being called there Philip I of Portugal. He {{took a lot}} of trouble however in getting both nobilities, Spanish and Portuguese, hating one another, as quite, {{peaceful}} and no mixings or misunderstandings <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
5|$|Roquebert {{had learned}} the correct signals for Spanish {{shipping}} from captured Spanish merchant ships and, having lured Junon within range, opened a destructive fire from Renommée that caused severe damage to Junons rigging. Unable to manoeuvere away from the French due to the damage suffered in the opening broadside, Shortland returned fire <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> while closing with Renommée to inflict maximum damage. As Junon closed with the flagship, Clorinde attacked her {{from the other side}} and the flûtes took up stations fore and aft, repeatedly raking the British ship. Observateur had been some distance behind Junon when the action began, and was thus not directly engaged by any of the French ships. Wetherall initially fired at Clorinde from extreme range, but soon recognised that he could do nothing to aid Junon in the face of overwhelming French numbers and so sailed westward to find and warn other British ships of the approaching French squadron. As Observateur escaped, Junon was pounded from all sides, Roquebert's ship coming so close to the British frigate that their rigging tangled and they collided, inflicting further damage. The French squadron was so close to Junon that the soldiers carried aboard for the garrison on Guadeloupe were able to fire their muskets at the British top deck, killing many of the sailors manning the guns.|$|E
25|$|There were {{problems}} with Oliver Smith's designs. His painted backdrops were stunning, but the sets were, {{for the most}} part, either shabby looking or too stylized. Prince refused {{to spend money on}} new construction, and Smith was obliged to improve what he had <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> with very little money to do it.|$|E
25|$|Six {{days later}} HMS Princess Charlotte was off Tobago when she sighted {{them in the}} distance. The two French vessels were too far away for Princess Charlotte to chase them. Captain George Tobin of Princess Charlotte decided to {{disguise}} his vessel <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{in the hope that}} he could lure them to approach. He was successful and an engagement ensued.|$|E
25|$|General Dyer {{tried to}} win over the Sikhs <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> forced the manager of the Golden Temple and Sunder Singh Majithia to use their {{influence}} over the Sikhs, in favour of the government. As a result, priests of the Golden Temple invited General Dyer to the sacred shrine and presented him with a Siropa (turban and sword).|$|R
50|$|Eventually, the Uesugi forces {{reached the}} Takeda command post, {{and one of}} the most famous single combats in Japanese history ensued. Uesugi Kenshin himself burst into the headquarters, attacking Takeda Shingen who, {{unprepared}} for such an event, parried with his signalling fan <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and held Kenshin off long enough for one of his retainers, Hara Osumi-no-Kami, to spear Kenshin's mount and drive him off.|$|R
5|$|Ivan Vladislav left a mixed heritage, varying from a {{reputation}} of being a ruthless murderer to a hero defending his country <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> The descendants of Ivan Vladislav entered the Byzantine nobility and rose to the highest ranks of the hierarchy. Two women of his family became empresses of the Byzantine Empire and others became military commanders or high-ranking officials. He was an ancestor of the Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos.|$|R
25|$|He {{was tried}} for treason on 19 September; the Crown {{repaired}} the weaknesses in its case by secretly buying {{the assistance of}} Emmet's defence attorney, Leonard McNally, for £200 and a pension. But McNally's assistant Peter Burrowes could not be bought and he pleaded the case <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> On 19 September, Emmet {{was found guilty of}} high treason.|$|E
25|$|Starting in May 1925, the Copiaus {{performed}} {{plays by}} Molière {{as well as}} those written expressly for them by Copeau, using masks of their own invention. Their presentations were preceded by a parade of the entire troupe, accompanied by drums, horns and colorful banners. They performed on a bare platform in village squares or whatever indoor space they could find. Copeau continued his work with this troupe <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> despite his heavy schedule of readings and lectures. But given their inventiveness and creativity, his control over the troupe lessened.|$|E
25|$|Soon after Pickett and Fitzhugh Lee {{left for}} lunch, Colonel Munford saw the Union attack {{shaping up as}} he {{prepared}} to have his cavalry division defend the left flank against the attack. Munford sent several couriers to look for Pickett or Fitzhugh Lee to tell them of the impending attack but they could not be found. Captain Henry Lee of Fitzhugh Lee's staff also could not find them. Munford had his division dismount, and deployed it on the left of Ransom's refused line. Each Confederate unit commander prepared for the attack <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> not always in co-operation with each other.|$|E

Swallowing his passion, therefore, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>best</b> <b>could,</b> <b>he</b> said-- ...|$|R
50|$|Rubin served most of {{his prison}} term in solitary confinement, during which he {{continued}} his research <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> When <b>he</b> fell ill with a suspected cancer, he was removed to a hospital and encouraged to make further confessions in return for favourable treatment, but declined the offer. He was released on a commuted sentence in 1934 and allowed to work in Aktyubinsk, Kazakhstan, as an economic planner. Rubin was arrested once more during the Great Purge in 1937. After this arrest he was never seen alive again.|$|R
50|$|Saint Rafael Arnáiz Barón (9 April 1911 - 26 April 1938) in {{religious}} María Rafael - is a Spanish Roman Catholic professed religious from the Trappists. He studied architecture in Madrid {{but decided to}} cease his studies {{in favor of the}} religious life but this was often interrupted due to his struggle with diabetes and his being called for active service.

25|$|Brentford and Waller were {{excellent}} strategists of the 17th century type, {{and neither}} would fight a pitched battle without every chance in his favour. Eventually on 29 June, the Royalists {{were successful in}} a series of minor fights about Cropredy Bridge. The result was, in accordance with continental custom, admitted to be an important victory, though Waller's main army drew off unharmed. In the meantime, on 15 June, Essex had relieved Lyme Regis and occupied Weymouth, and was preparing to go farther. The two rebel armies were now indeed separate. Waller had been left to do <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and a worse fate was soon to overtake the cautious earl.|$|E
25|$|While still {{dealing with}} the {{defeated}} enemy, news came from the Balkans reporting large-scale attacks from the Heruli, Goths, Gepids, and Bastarnae. Claudius immediately dispatched Aurelian to the Balkans to contain the invasion <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> until Claudius could arrive with his main army. The Goths were besieging Thessalonica when they heard of emperor Claudius' approach, causing them to abandon the siege and pillage north-eastern Macedonia. Aurelian intercepted the Goths with his Dalmatian cavalry and defeated them {{in a series of}} minor skirmishes, killing as many as three thousand of the enemy. Aurelian continued to harass the enemy, driving them northward into Upper Moesia where emperor Claudius had assembled his main army. The ensuing battle was indecisive: the northward advance of the Goths was halted but Roman losses were heavy.|$|E
25|$|Muhammad's {{policy in}} the next two years after the battle of Uhud was to prevent <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> the {{formation}} of alliances against him. Whenever alliances of tribesmen against Medina were formed, he sent out an expedition to break it up. When Muhammad heard of men massing with hostile intentions against Medina, he reacted with severity. One example is the assassination of Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, a member of the Jewish tribe of Banu Nadir who had gone to Mecca and written poems that had helped rouse the Meccans' grief, anger and desire for revenge after the battle of Badr (see the main article for other reasons for killing of Ka'b given in the historiographical sources). Around a year later, Muhammad expelled the Jewish Banu Nadir from Medina.|$|E
5000|$|Henson {{was pointed}} in the {{direction}} of Mr. Hibbard, who hired him and leased to him a shabby two story place that some pigs had taken to live in. After expelling the pigs, he spent the day cleaning it <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> At {{the end of the day}} he brought the rest of his family to the house. “Though there was nothing but walls and floors we were all in a state of great delight, and my old woman laughed and acknowledged that it was worth while.” ...|$|R

50|$|His final {{undertaking}} was {{the construction}} of the Manchester Ship Canal which has been described as the greatest engineering achievement of Victorian times. It is certainly an immense achievement and transformed an inland city into a major port. Thomas Andrew Walker was engaged as sole contractor in charge of the construction and he divided the thirty-six mile route into nine (soon reduced to eight) sections and appointed an engineer to take charge of each. Walker was known to be an excellent employer, looking after the needs of his workforce <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> and provided accommodation, meeting halls and hospital facilities.|$|R
25|$|The invaders took Tanjore {{by storm}} and, leaving the stronghold of Trichinopoly untouched, swept across Madurai and Tinnevelly and into Travancore. On their return from this {{expedition}} they {{took part in}} the quarrel between Meenakshi and Vangaru Tirumala. The latter approached Safdar Ali Khan with an offer of three million rupees if he would oust the queen in favour of himself. Unwilling to attack Trichinopoly, the Sultan prince contented himself with solemnly declaring Vangaru Thirumala to be king and taking the bond for the three millions. He then marched away, leaving Chanda Sahib to enforce his award <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> The queen, alarmed at the turn affairs now had taken, had little difficulty in persuading that facile politician to accept her bond for a crore of rupees (ten million) and declare her duly entitled to the throne.|$|E
25|$|Cromwell's success thus {{forced the}} King to {{concentrate}} his various armies in the neighbourhood of Oxford. The New Model had, so Fairfax and Cromwell hoped, found its target. But the Committee of Both Kingdoms {{on the one}} side, and Charles, Rupert, and Goring, on the other, held different views. On 1 May 1645, Fairfax, having been ordered to relieve Taunton, set out from Windsor for the long march to that place. Meeting Cromwell at Newbury on 2 May, he directed the lieutenant-general to watch {{the movements of the}} King's army. He himself marched on to Blandford, which he reached on 7 May. Thus, Fairfax and the main army of Parliament were marching away in the west, while Cromwell's detachment was left, as Waller had been left the previous year, to hold the King, <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b>|$|E
25|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} {{by a black}} cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives the population began to call {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road. Pliny's mother requested him to abandon her and save his own life, as she was too corpulent and aged to go further, but seizing her hand he led her away <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> A rain of ash fell. Pliny found it necessary to shake off the ash periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder. The letter compares the ash to a blanket of snow. Evidently the earthquake and tsunami damage at that location were not severe enough to prevent continued use of the home.|$|E

50|$|Peter Adolf Hall was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ideology. Among those who visited his home on the Rue du Petit-Reposoir in Paris were not only the art world participants and patrons but also the Marquis of Lafayette. Hall was present at the Storming of the Bastille as a revolutionary officer. In 1791 he went into exile though and never reunited with his family in Paris ever again. His wife's inherited wealth was confiscated by the nation and a son-in-law married to the painter's first-born was torn to pieces by a mob six weeks after their wedding. Hall supported his family from abroad <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> but died in Belgium a few years later.|$|R
