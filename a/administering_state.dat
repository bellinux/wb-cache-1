50|$|In 2001, Şereş {{joined the}} PUR (PC from 2005). In 2002, he became head of its {{department}} devoted to financing infrastructure projects for local PUR officeholders, and helped finance ten projects. In 2003 he became {{secretary general of}} the party, rising to vice president the following year, when he was also elected senator. In the Senate, he sat on the following committees: budget, finance, banking and capital markets (2006-2008); equal opportunity (2006); and privatisation and <b>administering</b> <b>state</b> assets (2004-2006). He was also vice president of the body during one session. Additionally, he served as Economy Minister from December 2004 to December 2006, resigning when the PC withdrew its support from the government. Around the same time, prosecutors from the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) opened an investigation into Şereş dealing with his relationship to the Bulgarian consultant Stamen Stanchev. They charged he had granted insider information or otherwise used his position to help Stanchev facilitate the privatisation of Electrica South Muntenia, of the Romanian government's 8% holding in Petrom, and of Romexterra Bank, as well as the planned privatisation of the Turceni Energy Complex, allegations that he denied. In 2009, a formal criminal case was opened against Şereş, who was indicted for treason and organised crime; five other persons are involved in the case, including Şereş' former ministerial colleague Zsolt Nagy. In 2013, he was convicted of the charges and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. In 2015, upon the exhaustion of his appeals, he was given a sentence of four years and eight months and incarcerated. Additionally, he was sentenced to four years' imprisonment in a case involving a corruption scandal at the state hydroelectric company, but appealed that ruling. The ruling was also upheld in early 2016 by the High Court.|$|E
40|$|The ICC {{and other}} {{international}} criminal tribunals have at their disposal premises {{for the purpose of}} the pre-trial detention of accused. However, for the enforcement of their sentences these international tribunals are dependent on the assistance of States. Article 103 of the ICCSt stipulates that a sentence of imprisonment shall be served in a State designated by the ICC from a list of States which have indicated to the Court their willingness to accept sentenced persons. Legally, this amounts to a transfer of execution of a (foreign) judgment, a device that is well-known in the realm of international cooperation in criminal matters. In this horizontal context such transfers are usually governed by international treaties, the most famous of them being the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This Convention leaves States parties ample leeway to arrange the transfer of sentences and prisoners, but attaches a number of minimum requirements, like the condition that the sentenced person, the sentencing State and the <b>administering</b> <b>State</b> all agree to the transfer, that the sentenced person is a national of the <b>administering</b> <b>State</b> and that the condition of ‘double criminality’ is satisfied. Such conditions serve to reconcile the interests of States with those of the sentenced person. In the vertical framework of cooperation between the ICC and States, both the sovereign interests of States involved and the position of the individual are less prevailing and, indeed, are expected to succumb to the overarching aspirations of international criminal justice...|$|E

40|$|Privacy law, to {{the extent}} that it regulates state {{information}} practices, wears two “public” hats. The first hat is constitutional law. For example, the Canadian Charter protects privacy through protecting individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures. The second hat is public sector data protection law modelled on what are known as Fair Information Practices (FIPs). For example, in Canada the federal Privacy Act regulates the collection, use and disclosure of personal information held by government institutions and provides individuals with a right of access to that information. The constitutional hat is concerned with state-individual relations in the context of law enforcement while the data protection hat is concerned with state-individual relations in the context of <b>administering</b> <b>state</b> programs. This article calls into question the ongoing relevance of this divide. The merging of these two frameworks is a large project to both undertake and defend. This article only purports to offer some initial reflections on a potential merger, focusing on recent Supreme Court cases, including R. v. Spencer; R. v. Wakeling; and R. v. Fearon. First, this article outlines some of the ways in which our Charter jurisprudence already adopts some of the insights that come out of the data protection law model and points to some of the ways in which this can be built upon. Next, the article outlines the potential problems of using data protection law framework in the context of law enforcement and anti-terrorism if the limitations of data protection are not well understood when balancing interests. Finally, it finishes with some proposals about how merging the two models might better address some new types of “Big Data” investigatory techniques, or, what we now all describe post-Snowden, as “collecting-the-haystack-to-find-the-needle”...|$|E

40|$|Elevating teaching-to-the-test to dogma, {{from the}} {{beginning}} with the distortion of Dr. Cannell’s findings, has served {{to divert attention from}} scandals that should have threatened US educators’ almost complete control of their own evaluation. [10] Had the scandal Dr. Cannell uncovered been portrayed honestly to the public—educators cheat on tests administered internally with lax security—the obvious solution would have been to externally manage all assessments (Oliphant, 2011). Recent test cheating scandals in Atlanta, Washington, DC, and elsewhere once again drew attention to a serious problem. But, instead of blaming lax security and internally managed test administration, most educators blamed the stakes and alleged undue pressure that ensues (Phelps 2011 a). Their recommendation, as usual: drop the stakes and reduce the amount of testing. Never mind the ironies: they want oversight lifted so they may operate with none, and they admit that they cannot be trusted to administer tests to our children properly, but we should trust them to educate our children properly if we leave them alone. Perhaps the most profound factoids revealed by the more recent scandals were, first, that the cheating had continued for ten years in Atlanta before any responsible person attempted to stop it and, even then, it required authorities outside the education industry to report the situation honestly. Second, in both Atlanta and Washington, DC, education industry test security consultants repeatedly declared the systems free of wrongdoing (Phelps 2011 b). Meanwhile, thirty years after J. J. Cannell first showed us how lax security leads to corrupted test scores, regardless the stakes, test security remains cavalierly loose. We have teachers <b>administering</b> <b>state</b> tests in their own classrooms to their own students, principals distributing and collecting test forms in their own schools. Security may be high outside the schoolhouse door, but inside, too much is left to chance. And, as it turns out, educators are as human as the rest of us; some of them cheat and not all of them manage to keep test materials secure, even when they aren’t intentionally cheating. - See more at: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{research focuses on}} trade union organisations, and in particular trade union officialdom in Egypt. The study examines {{the extent to which}} trade union officials at the various levels of the trade union hierarchy are reacting to reforms instigated by structural adjustment policies. The adoption of structural adjustment and economic reform measures as proposed by the World Bank and IMF have resulted in the government's withdrawal of some of the benefits and privileges it accorded to workers. Public sector workers are particularly affected by these changes, thereby posing a challenge to trade union officialdom, since the bulk of trade union membership is within the public sector. Trade union officials are reacting to the reform measures by trying to balance their role as representatives of workers' interests and their role in <b>administering</b> <b>state</b> policy. Whereas in the past these two roles were reconcilable, however, with liberalisation of the economy and the adoption of structural adjustment measures that is no longer tenable. Trade unionism has been weakened by the incorporation of union officials within government corporate structures, making it more difficult for trade union officialdom to challenge the reform measures adopted by the government. Rather, trade union officials are opting for `co-operation' both with the government and with management in enterprises, to the cost of workers. In enterprises, trade union officials emphasise that the interests of work and workers are inseparable. At the level of the confederation and general unions, union officials present themselves as working to keep workers' rights, but also as partners with the government in its drive for growth. By so doing trade union officials are de-politicising trade unionism, and instead focus on economic gains. Union officials are redefining their role away from workers. Trade union action at the various levels is not based on what workers want or demand, but rather on what trade union officials want, in the belief that workers do not truly know their interests. As a result, trade union action has promoted the interests of union officials rather than that of the workers. Trade unionism has become in a sense a shell without a content. However, there is evidence that there are pressures to democratise trade unionism and make it more responsive to worker demands. These pressures are from within the worker base, from trade union officials particularly at the enterprise level who are affilited to political parties, and from external forces like the Islamists. However these forces have their limitations, particularly in the face of institutionalised sectors that are capable of reproducing themselves and promoting their interests...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Political structures {{and the evolution of}} late capitalism in liberal Western democracies lend a common frame to the development of national media systems. However, whereas media policy from the post-war period to the mid- 1980 s was largely driven by socio-political concerns and coextensive with policy for public service television, this model has been vehemently challenged. Key factors were the convergence of erstwhile-separated industries and infrastructures, as well as the ambitions of the corporate sector and governments alike, to benefit from the economic opportunities offered by the communications revolution. By assessing the changing relationship between the role of the state, economic structures and technological innovation, this research investigates these processes in the UK and Germany. Both countries have the two key public service systems but also feature striking differences such as the antithetic political systems and democratic processes (majoritarian vs. consensus democracy). The basic assumption suggests that a genuine understanding of contemporary developments is only possible if political/economic as well as historic/sociological perspectives are incorporated into the holistic approach applied. Thereby this study gives consideration to key processes and events which have determined transitions between communications policy paradigms and regulatory regimes. Given the Anglo-Saxon tradition of regulating, key processes and events in the UK are often indicated by the appointment and report of a committee of enquiry. For {{the purpose of this study}} the most crucial of these is the Committee on Financing the BBC (1986), which first applied market-driven politics onto British broadcasting, and whose recommendations still serve as a blueprint for current communications policy-making. In Germany the KtK Report (1974) formed the basis for decisive reforms in broadcasting and communications. Apart from that, however, Germany features the characteristic of <b>administering</b> <b>state</b> interventions in as detailed a manner as possible through legislation. Of central importance are, therefore, the rulings of the Federal Constitutional Court, which continuously set decisive parameters for the development of the broadcasting system. The thesis follows two driving themes which have been identified as crucial in terms of the comparative dimension and are elaborated continuously in more detail. First, the focus is on the interdependencies between public and private sector. Second, implications and responses of the central vis-à-vis federal characteristic of state formation are investigated. In doing so, the thesis draws on vast sources of archival documents as well as exclusive material from a series of elite interviews with a purposively-selected sample of very high-level sources, including Chairmen, Director-Generals, ministers, very senior civil servants and so on. The thesis demonstrates how communications policy-making is carried out in both countries and how these processes are determined by national regulatory frameworks which are rooted within the borders of the nation state. As such the research findings have broader implications for commercial and public sector regulation...|$|E
