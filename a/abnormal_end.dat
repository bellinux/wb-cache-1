5000|$|Optimizer - Capex's IBM COBOL Compiler optimizer using Peephole {{optimization}} - This product had {{two significant}} additional components: The first was called Analyzer, {{and the second}} was called Detector. The former allowed execution analysis giving a count {{of the number of}} times program instructions were executed. This provided a way for the COBOL computer programmer to move source code so the most frequently executed conditions would be found first, thus saving time on needless IF statements. While this may not be significant for a few hundred input file records, it was very important when there were millions of input records. The latter, Detector, trapped execution [...] "abends" [...] (<b>abnormal</b> <b>ends)</b> to the execution of an instruction, displayed the contents of applicable fields, and could be told to apply a fix to the offending field so program execution could continue. The programmer could then correct one or more error conditions later and recompile the program. Both were substantial time savers in IBM mainframe OS/MVS and DOS/VSE COBOL environments. Computer Associates subsequently developed an additional product called CA-OPTIMIZER II for the OS/MVS operating system.|$|R

Objective: To evaluate whether this metabolite score can predict 3 -year neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with perinatal asphyxia and HIE, compared with current standard biochemical and clinical markers. Methods: From September 2009 to June 2011, infants at risk of perinatal asphyxia were recruited from a single maternity hospital. Cord blood was drawn and biobanked at delivery. Neonates were monitored for development of encephalopathy both clinically and electrographically. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at 36 - 42 months using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, ed. III (BSID-III). Death and cerebral palsy were also considered as <b>abnormal</b> <b>end</b> points. Results: Thirty-one infants had both metabolomic analysis and neurodevelopmental outcome at 36 - 42 months. No child had a severely abnormal BSID-III result. The metabolite index significantly correlated with outcome (ρ 2 = 0. 30, p 3 ̆c 0. 01), which is robust to predict both severe outcome (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0. 92, p 3 ̆c 0. 01) and intact survival (0. 80, p = 0. 01). There was no correlation between the index score and performance in the individual BSID-III subscales (cognitive, language, motor). Conclusions: The metabolite index outperformed other standard biochemical markers at birth for prediction of outcome at 3 years, but was not superior to EEG or the Sarnat score. © 2016 S.

40|$|Abstract Background Unlike {{maternal}} inheritance of mitochondria in sexual reproduction, somatic hybrids follow no obvious pattern. The introgressed segment orf 138 from the mitochondrial genome of radish (Raphanus sativus) to its counterpart in rapeseed (Brassica napus) demonstrates that this inheritance mode {{derives from the}} cytoplasm of both parents. Sequencing of the complete mitochondrial genome of five species from Brassica family allowed the prediction of other extraneous sources of the cybrids from the radish parent, and the determination of their mitochondrial rearrangement. Results We obtained the complete mitochondrial genome of Ogura -cms-cybrid (oguC) rapeseed. To date, {{this is the first}} time that a heterogeneously composed mitochondrial genome was sequenced. The 258, 473 bp master circle constituted of 33 protein-coding genes, 3 rRNA sequences, and 23 tRNA sequences. This mitotype noticeably holds two copies of atp 9 and is devoid of cox 2 - 2. Relative to nap mitochondrial genome, 40 point mutations were scattered in the 23 protein-coding genes. atp 6 even has an abnormal start locus whereas tatC has an <b>abnormal</b> <b>end</b> locus. The rearrangement of the 22 syntenic regions that comprised 80. 11 % of the genome was influenced by short repeats. A pair of large repeats (9731 bp) was responsible for the multipartite structure. Nine unique regions were detected when compared with other published Brassica mitochondrial genome sequences. We also found six homologous chloroplast segments (Brassica napus). Conclusions The mitochondrial genome of oguC is quite divergent from nap and pol, which are more similar with each other. We analyzed the unique regions of every genome of the Brassica family, and found that very few segments were specific for these six mitotypes, especially cam, jun, and ole, which have no specific segments at all. Therefore, we conclude that the most specific regions of oguC possibly came from radish. Compared with the chloroplast genome, six identical regions were found in the seven mitochondrial genomes, which show that the Brassica family has a stable chloroplast-derived source. </p...|$|E

(height 168 cm, weight 55 kg), male, complained of periodical burning pain behind the breastbone without connection with physical activity, often disturbing at night, stopped with intake of nitrates. The following examination of the patient was performed: clinical and biochemical blood tests, electrocardiography (ECG), Holter ECG monitoring, bicycle ergometry, echocardiography, coronary angiography, computerized tomography. Results. The following clinical diagnosis was set {{on the basis of}} complaints. data of objective and instrumental examination: congenital heart disease. <b>Abnormal</b> <b>end</b> of the coronary arteries: multiple coronary and left ventricular fistulas, steal syndrome. Hypoplasia of the right coronary artery (Q 24. 5 in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, revision 10). Coronary angiography has become the main diagnostic method that allowed diagnosis verification: left type of coronary blood circulation. The trunk of the left coronary artery, the anterior interventricular branch,  he diagonal branch, the envelope branch, the obtuse marginal branch, the right coronary artery, the posterior interventricular branch have with irregular contours. Direct abnormal connection (dense grid of fistulas) is observed in the medium and lower third of the anterior interventricular branch with the left ventricle cavity. The contrast agent practically completely comes into the left ventricular cavity. The parenchymal phase is very well expressed; the venous phase is not visualized. Conclusion. Congenital heart disease: multiple coronary and left ventricular fistulas. No angiographic evidence of hemodynamically significant stenotic coronary lesions. Conclusion. The practical interest of this observation is due to rarity of disease, analysis of modern possibilities of diagnostics and complexity of the choice of the therapy tactics.

40|$|Physician-patient {{relationship}} {{is unique in}} some aspects and not-so-unique in other aspects {{when compared to other}} human interactions. Until-unless for the sake of health promotional activities, this {{relationship is}} almost always conceived in the times of human sufferings and consequently culminated when those sufferings have subsided as well as sought out happiness has ensued/been achieved. However, not all physician-patient relationships follow the normal course and/or meet the natural <b>ends.</b> These <b>abnormal</b> relationships are not inconsequential in terms of numbers and/or their effects (short-term and long term) on both patients and physicians. Every country has its own baggage in the wake of why, how and what about these <b>abnormal</b> <b>ends</b> to physician-patient relationships; however, the most common causes are the patients’ inability to pay their medical bills, the conflicting goals of physicians and their patients in regards to patients’ sufferings’ management and finally the behavioral issues (patients’ and/or physicians’) interfering these relationships. Irrespective of any cause, the physicians should never forget that the patient can always discharge their physicians and discontinue their relationship with their physicians without any reason (until unless the physicians deem those patients either incapable/non-consentable to do so and/or potential threat to their own personal safety or other people’s safety). Contrarily, physicians can also discharge patients from their care but cannot abandon these patients (1 - 3) which mean that physicians have to ensure their discharged patients either are referred to or have sought another physician within appropriate time frame post-relationship-discontinuation. Each country has their own medico-legal liabilities that vary in terms of penalties imposed; however, irrespective of the feared legal concerns, the physicians should not forget that ethical essence of medicine is the art of healing that does not encompass part of deserting patients but rather appropriate transferring of patient care to accepting/receptive fellow brethren/colleagues. The transfer of care does not mean that a particular physician has failed to perform his/her duties for his/her patients rather that the particular relationship with a particular patient has failed to meet its ends. Therefore without abandoning the patient, the patient is given ample and honest opportunity to be transferred out to another physician with the sincere hope that the discharged patient will be able to achieve relief of his/her suffering with the new physician-patient relationship meeting their goals and means-to-the-ends. The one thing that need not be forgotten is that the terminated physician-patient relationship can always be revived if the causative concerns have been resolved in the interim and if the medico-legal laws and ethical practices allow the relationships’ revival. In summary, it is prerogative of the patient (whose suffering made him/her to reach out to a physician and enter in a physician-patient relationship in the first place) when he/she wants to and decides to terminate physician-patient relationship; whereas the prerogative of the physician is to recognize a dysfunctional physician-patient relationship early-on so that corrective measures (if possible) can be executed, and if that is not possible, then instead of patient abandonment, patients may be appropriately and timely transferred out off failed physician-patient relationship...|$|R

Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) can affect other AA levels by reducing AA efflux from muscle due to inhibition of muscle protein degradation. Essential amino acids and keto acid supplements including BCAA and branched-chain keto acid (BCKA) are proposed to decrease protein intake while maintaining protein status. This study was taken up to evaluate {{the effect of a}} dialysis session on plasma BCAA&#x 2019;s for which fifteen patients of ESRD on Maintenance HD, thrice a week were recruited into the study. Analysis was done on samples drawn at the beginning (pre-HD) and after the end of each dialysis session (post-HD). Plasma BCAA&#x 2019;s were estimated by Reverse phase High performance liquid chromatography using pre column derivatization with O-pthalaldehyde-Mercaptoethanol. A significant decrease in plasma concentration of Valine and Isoleucine were observed post-HD compared to the pre-HD levels (p&#x 3 c; 0. 05). After correcting the data by creatinine, the decrease in plasma concentrations of Valine and Isoleucine were still found to be statistically significant. The percentage losses after the completion of HD were &#x 2013; 24. 45, &#x 2013; 23. 19, and &#x 2013; 6. 22 % respectively for valine, isoleucine, and leucine. The lower reduction in leucine could be due to its appearance from muscle catabolism during the dialysis session. In conclusion, hemodialysis itself may influence dialysate amino acid losses and may have an effect on muscle protein breakdown and this negative protein can be reversed with nutritional supplementation...|$|R

HIV-negative, BCG-vaccinated Kenyan adults without evidence of tuberculosis, 10 QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-G) (−) and 10 QFT-G(+), were randomized 4 : 1 to receive AERAS- 402 or placebo as two doses, on Days 0 and 56, with follow up to Day 182. There were no deaths, serious adverse events or withdrawals. For 1 AERAS- 402 QFT-G(−) and 1 AERAS- 402 QFT-G(+) subject, there were 3 self-limiting severe AEs of injection site pain: 1 after the first vaccination and 1 after each vaccination, respectively. Two additional severe AEs considered vaccine-related were reported after the first vaccination in AERAS- 402 QFT-G(+) subjects: elevated blood creatine phosphokinase and neutropenia, the latter slowly improving but remaining <b>abnormal</b> until study <b>end.</b> AERAS- 402 was not detected in urine or throat cultures for any subject. In intracellular cytokine staining studies, curtailed by technical issues, we saw modest CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses to Mtb Ag 85 A/b peptide pools among both QFT-G(−) and (+) subjects, with trends in the CD 4 + T cells suggestive of boosting after the second vaccine dose, slightly more so in QFT-G(+) subjects.

40|$|The role {{of early}} {{coronary}} revascularization {{in the management}} of stable coronary artery disease remains controversial. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of early coronary revascularization on long-term outcomes (> 10  years) after an ischemic dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. Patients without stress-induced ischemia on DSE and those who underwent late coronary revascularization (> 90  days after DSE) were excluded. The final study cohort consisted of 905 patients. A DSE with a peak wall motion score index of 1. 1 to 1. 7 was considered mild to moderately abnormal (n = 460), and > 1. 7 was markedly <b>abnormal</b> (n =  445). <b>End</b> points were all-cause and cardiac mortality. The impact of early coronary revascularization on outcomes was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox's proportional hazard regression models. Early coronary revascularization was performed in 222 patients (percutaneous coronary intervention in 113 [51 %] and coronary artery bypass grafting in 109 patients [49 %]). During a median follow-up time of 10  years (range 8 to 15), 474 deaths (52 %) occurred, of which were 241 (51 %) due to cardiac causes. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that both in patients with a markedly abnormal DSE and a mild-to-moderately abnormal DSE, early revascularization was associated with better long-term outcomes. Multivariable analyses revealed that early revascularization had a beneficial effect on all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0. 60, 95 % confidence interval 0. 46 to 0. 79) and cardiac mortality (hazard ratio 0. 49, 95 % confidence interval 0. 34 to 0. 72). In conclusion, early coronary revascularization has a beneficial impact on long-term outcomes in patients with myocardial ischemia on DSE. Early coronary revascularization was associated with better outcomes not only in patients with a markedly abnormal DSE but also in those with a mild to moderately abnormal DSE...|$|R

We investigated Mgc’s role in the regulation of RhoA-GTP and Rac 1 -GTP in the intact vertebrate epithelium of Xenopus laevis embryos and in cultured cells using a combination of fluorescence microscopy, molecular biology, and biochemical assays. We show that Mgc’s GAP activity spatially restricts accumulation of both RhoA-GTP and Rac 1 -GTP in epithelial cells – RhoA at the cleavage furrow and RhoA and Rac 1 at cell-cell junctions. Phosphorylation at serine 386 within Mgc’s GAP domain is not required for GTPase specificity, but functional Mgc GAP activity is required for successful cytokinesis. We found that Mgc is localized to the plus ends of individual equatorial astral microtubules during cytokinesis in Xenopus embryos, and identified a putative SxIP motif in Xenopus Mgc, which promotes co-localization with EB 1 and microtubule plus end stability. Mutation of Mgc’s SxIP motif resulted in loss of Mgc tracking on growing microtubule plus <b>ends,</b> <b>abnormal</b> astral microtubule organization, and severe cytokinesis defects resulting from misregulated RhoA-GTP accumulation. Further, we found that Mgc localizes to adherens junctions in polarized epithelial cells via its SxIP motif and regulates adherens junction structure and integrity through modulation of RhoA signaling. Together, these results indicate that Mgc has GAP activity toward both RhoA and Rac 1 at spatially distinct cellular locations, and that proper localization of Mgc is dependent upon its ability to be tethered at microtubule plus ends via the SxIP motif. Our data provide novel mechanistic insight into the regulation of Rho family GTPases in epithelial tissues, which is important for improving our understanding of signaling pathways that regulate epithelial pathologies...|$|R
40|$|Basic Antenatal Care (BANC) {{is a way}} of {{training}} or upgrading the knowledge and skills of all nurses, midwives and doctors involved in antenatal care at the primary health care level so that the minimum care can be provided effectively. This study was conducted to investigate the implementation of the BANC program by midwives in the Mdantsane clinics during February 2009. Methods: A descriptive study design was undertaken targeting midwives providing antenatal care to pregnant women, in 14 clinics of Mdantsane. Data was collected from 25 midwives in the clinics, and from 140 ANC cards of women attending ANC on the day of their visit to the clinic. Results: The majority of midwives providing BANC in Mdantsane clinics were not trained in BANC. There were 10 trained midwives and 15 not yet trained. A total of twenty five midwives were involved in the study. The number of visits according to the BANC schedule was well known by the midwives in the study. The content of the visits was well known for the first visit, but for subsequent visits, the participating midwives could not state exactly what they do on these visits. They perceived BANC as something beneficial for both midwives and pregnant women with 24 of the participating midwives rating BANC as advantageous. In completing an ANC card, the midwives scored between 48 percent and 100 percent. Under examination, they scored between 52 percent and 100 percent. Lastly on interpretation and decision making, they scored between 0 percent and 92 percent. This could have troubling consequences for the health status of the mother and baby. Weaknesses in providing antenatal care identified in the study included participating midwives failing to fill in the last normal menstrual period (LNMP) and the estimated date of delivery (EDD), which was a worrying observation. Plotting of the gestational age at first visit was also not carried out well as only 47 percent of the midwives in the study did this, meaning {{that there would be a}} miscalculation of the gestational age thereafter throughout the pregnancies. The body mass index (BMI) was not calculated as the maternal height and weight were not written on the ANC card. This should be completed in order to check the nutritional status of the pregnant woman to help supplement, if malnourished, and educate on diet, if overweight. Only 17 percent of the midwives in the study plotted the foetal presentation. Failure to plot foetal presentation could lead to complications during delivery because women with <b>abnormal</b> presentations could <b>end</b> up delivering in a clinic instead of the hospital. Conclusion: This study showed that even though midwives are implementing BANC among pregnant women, it is not being carried out correctly. Therefore the programme will not be as beneficial as it would be if put into practice correctly. This is highlighted by the lack of knowledge from the untrained midwives regarding the content of care on subsequent visits. Thus there is an urgent need for BANC training to be conducted and monitored at various sites...|$|R
