Where mixing occurs with fresh water runoff from river mouths, near melting glaciers or vast amounts of precipitation (e.g. Monsoon), seawater can be substantially less saline. The most saline open sea is the Red Sea, where high rates of evaporation, low precipitation and low river run-off, and confined circulation result in unusually salty water.

40|$|The {{brackish}} {{water of the}} Baltic Sea {{is a mixture of}} ocean water from the Atlantic/North Sea with fresh water from various rivers draining a large area of lowlands and mountain ranges. The evaporation-precipitation balance results in an additional but minor excess of fresh water. The rivers carry different loads of salts washed out of the ground, in particular calcium carbonate, which cause a composition anomaly of the salt dissolved in the Baltic Sea in comparison to Standard Seawater. Directly measured seawater density shows a related anomaly when compared to the density computed from the equation of state as a function of Practical Salinity, temperature and pressure. Samples collected from different regions of the Baltic Sea during 2006 – 2009 were analysed for their density anomaly. The results obtained for the river load deviate significantly from similar measurements carried out forty years ago; the reasons for this decadal variability are not yet fully understood.

40|$|Stable isotope {{ratios of}} whole rock carbonates and faunas from three low {{latitude}} Upper Ordovician sections demonstrate a coherent pattern of shifting subtropical and tropical water masses and associated climate belts. We suggest that tropical water beneath the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (δ 18 O = − 10 ‰ to − 15 ‰) was isotopically light reflecting high sea-surface temperatures (SST) and reduced sea-surface salinity (SSS). Subtropical water {{in both the}} northern and southern hemispheres is characterised by δ 18 O values from − 4 to − 6 ‰. Our interpretation is consistent with the published results from physical–chemical modeling of Ordovician seawater composition and climate models. Deriving <b>absolute</b> temperature and <b>salinity</b> values from Ordovician δ 18 Ocarb data is problematic as they could reflect SST, SSS, ice volume and potentially a variable diagenetic overprint, and currently no independent constraints exist for any of these variables. The ITCZ was positioned at − 10 °N of the Equator during the early Katian consistent with the likely position of the region of peak sea-surface temperature (SST). During the late Katian Boda Event the ITCZ moved across the Equator to − 10 °S. By analogy with the Pliocene this resulted in a symmetrical distribution of sea-surface currents about the Equator. This led to a net increase in heat flow towards the poles and lower latitudinal temperature gradients, potentially explaining the migration of warm water faunas to higher southern latitudes during the Boda Event. During the Hirnantian the ITCZ shifted north of the Equator, resulting in a reduced poleward heat transport. ITCZ position has been proposed as a likely forcing mechanism of Neogene glaciation and the evidence from the Ordovician suggests a discrete palaeo-ITCZ whose position was controlled by solar insolation and latitudinal temperature gradients linked to ice volume changes and Hadley Cell dynamics. We hypothesize that the position of the ITCZ was sensitive to the growing Hirnantian ice sheet during the Late Ordovician. We propose that latitudinal movement of the ITCZ during the Late Ordovician resulted in a major atmosphere–ocean circulation re-organization. Higher pCO 2 estimates for the Ordovician caused more extreme changes in this circulation that were the likely primary cause of biotic mass extinction.

40|$|As one of few {{who have}} been {{involved}} in the equation of state of seawater over the last 40 years, the author was invited to review some of the history behind its early development and also the more recent thermodynamic equation of state. The article first reviews early (late 1800 s) work by Knudsen and others in defining the concept of salinity. This summary leads into the development of the practical salinity scale. Our studies at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, along with the work of Alain Poisson’s group at Laboratoire de Physique et Chimie, Université Pierre et Marie Curie and that of Alvin Bradshaw and Karl Schleicher at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, were instrumental in deriving the 1980 equation of state (EOS- 80) that has been used for 30 years. The fundamental work of Ranier Feistel at Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research led to the development of a Gibbs free energy function that is the backbone of the new thermodynamic equation of state (TEOS- 10). It can be used to determine all of the thermodynamic properties of seawater. The salinity input to the TEOS- 10 Gibbs function requires knowledge of the <b>absolute</b> <b>salinity</b> of seawater (SA), which is based upon the reference salinity of seawater (SR). The reference salinity is our best estimate of the <b>absolute</b> <b>salinity</b> of the seawater that was used to develop the practical salinity scale (SP), the equation of state, and the other thermodynamic properties of seawater. Reference salinity is related to practical salinity by SR = SP (35. 16504 / 35. 000) g kg- 1 and <b>absolute</b> <b>salinity</b> is related to reference salinity by SA = SR + δSA,where δSA is due to the added solutes in seawater in deep waters resulting from the dissolution of CaCO 3 (s) and SiO 2 (s), CO 2, and nutrients like NO 3 and PO 4 from the oxidation of plant material. The δSA values due to the added solutes are estimated from the differences between the measured densities of seawater samples compared with the densities calculated from the TEOS- 10 equation of state (Δρ) at the same reference salinity, temperature, and pressure, using δSA = Δρ/ 0. 75179 g kg- 1. The values of δSA in the ocean can be estimated for waters at given longitude, latitude, and depth using correlations of δSA and the concentration of Si(OH) 4 in the waters. The SA values can then be used to calculate all the thermodynamic properties of seawater in the major oceans using the new TEOS- 10.

These studies {{are based on}} a newly determined major ion composition, which for the open lake shows a mean <b>absolute</b> <b>salinity</b> of 6. 06 g kg(- 1). The conductivity-temperature relationship of the lake water was determined experimentally showing that the lake water is about 1. 25 times less conductive than seawater diluted to the same <b>absolute</b> <b>salinity</b> as that of the lake water. Based on these results, an algorithm is presented to calculate salinity from in-situ conductivity measurements. Applied to the field data, this shows small but important vertical salinity variations in the lake with a salinity maximum at 200 m and a freshening of the surface water with increasing proximity to the shores. The algorithm we adopt to calculate density agrees well with earlier measurements and shows that at 20 degreesC and I atm Lake Issyk-Kul water is about 530 g m(- 3) denser than seawater at the same salinity. The temperature of maximum density at I atm is about 0. 15 degreesC lower than that for seawater diluted to the same salinity. Despite its small variations, salinity plays an important role, together with temperature changes, in the static stability and in the production of deep-water in this lake. Changes in salinity may have had important consequences on the mixing regime and the fate of inflowing river water over geological time.

Density (q), total alkalinity (TA), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measurements were taken on waters collected in the eastern Arctic Ocean. The results were examined relative to the properties of North Atlantic Waters. The excess densities (Dq = qMeas- qCalc) in the surface Arctic waters were higher than expected (maximum of 0. 008 kg m- 3) when compared to Standard Seawater. This excess is due to the higher values of the normalized total alkalinity (NTA = TA * 35 /S) (up to * 2, 650 lmol kg- 1) and DOC (up to * 130 lmol kg- 1) resulting from river water input. New measurements are needed to determine how the DOC in the river waters contributes to the TA of the surface waters.

Soil saturation extract electrical conductivity (ECe), chloride (Cle) and sodium adsorption ratio (SARe) values increased in all treatments of both grapevines along the irrigation seasons, but the increases were much lower in the mulched than in the bare soils due to reduced evaporation losses and concomitant decreases in salt evapo-concentration.

Although further work is needed to substantiate these results, the conclusion is that the plastic mulch and, particularly, the organic mulch were more efficient than the bare soil for soil salinity and sodicity control...|$|E
40|$|Salinity {{determination}} in seawater {{has been}} carried out for almost 30 years using the 1978 Practical Salinity Standard. However, the numerical value of so-called practical salinity, computed from electrical conductivity, differs slightly from the true or <b>absolute</b> <b>salinity,</b> defined as the mass of dissolved solids per unit mass of seawater. The difference arises because more recent knowledge about the composition of seawater is not reflected in the definition of practical salinity, which was chosen to maintain historical continuity with previous measures, and because of spatial and temporal variations in the relative composition of seawater. Accounting for these variations in density calculations requires the calculation of a correction factor δSA, which is known to range from 0 to 0. 03 g kg&minus; 1 in the world oceans. Here a mathematical model relating compositional perturbations to δSA is developed, by combining a chemical model for the composition of seawater with a mathematical model for predicting the conductivity of multi-component aqueous solutions. Model calculations generally agree with estimates of δSA based on fits to direct density measurements, and show that biogeochemical perturbations affect conductivity only weakly. However, small systematic differences between model and density-based estimates remain. These may arise for several reasons, including uncertainty about the biogeochemical processes involved in the increase in Total Alkalinity in the North Pacific, uncertainty in the carbon content of IAPSO standard seawater, and uncertainty about the haline contraction coefficient for the constituents involved in biogeochemical processes. This model may then be important in constraining these processes, as well as in future efforts to improve parameterizations for δSA...|$|E

Individual mounds are up to 12 m high with slope angles varying between 3 ° and 12 °. Hydroacoustic data revealed mound axes lengths of 80 to 240 m. Slope angle, mound height, and density of mounds decrease with increasing water depth. The deepest mounds are composed of dead and fragmented Lophelia pertusa branches. Living CWCs, mainly L. pertusa, were sampled with box cores between 678 and 719 m water depth. Conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) measurements revealed living CWC colonies to occur within the deeper part of the North Atlantic Central Water (NACW; conservative temperature ? of 9. 78 – 9. 94 °C, <b>absolute</b> <b>salinity</b> SA of ca. 35. 632 g/kg, and seawater density ?? of 27. 31 – 27. 33 kg/m 3). Comparable CWC reefs off Mauritania (17 °N– 18 °N) and on the Renard Ridge (35 °N) in the Gulf of Cadiz, the latter consisting only of a dead CWC fabric, are also located in the deeper layer of the NACW slightly above the Mediterranean Outflow Water. The new CWC province, with its thin cover of living corals and much larger accumulations of dead thickets and fragmented coral rubble, was successfully discovered by CTD reconnaissance applying seawater density as a potential indicator of CWC occurrences, followed by hydroacoustic mapping.

40|$|Salinity is an {{important}} property of industrial and natural waters. It {{is defined as the}} measure of the mass of dissolved salts in a given mass of solution. High salinity has an impact on people and industries reliant on water. High levels of salt can reduce crop yields, limit the choice of crops that can be grown and, at higher concentrations over long periods, can kill trees and make the land unsuitable for agricultural purposes. Salinity increases the “hardness” of water, which can mean more soap and detergents have to be used or water softeners installed and maintained. This can also cause scaling in pipes and heaters. The experimental determination of the salt content by drying and weighing presents some difficulties due to the loss of some components. The only reliable way to determine the true or <b>absolute</b> <b>salinity</b> of natural water is to make a complete chemical analysis. However, the method is time consuming and cannot yield the precision necessity for accurate work. Thus to determine salinity, one normally used method involv es the measurement of a physical property such as conductivity, density or refractive index. The paper reports the refractometric fiber optic sensor for detection of salinity of water. The mathematical model is developed for detection of the refractive index of liquid and simulated in MATLAB. The fiber optic sensor probe is developed to measure the refractive index of the solution containing different amount of salt dissolved in water i. e. different molar concentrations. Experiments are carried out using the developed probe for these solutions. Experimental results are showing good agreement with the simulated results. </span...|$|E
40|$|The Vestfold Hills is a {{predominantly}} ice-free 'oasis' {{lying on the}} coast of Princess Elizabeth Land, East Antarctica. The region was formed as a consequence of isostatic readjustment of the coastline following retreat of the Pleistocene continental ice sheet. During this event, sea water was constrained and eventually trapped by the rising landmass. Over a period of ca. 8 - 10 000 yr, pockets of relict sea water have evolved to produce several hundred lakes, scattered throughout the Vestfold Hills. While some of the lakes have been flushed of their sea salt by glacial meltwaters, others have become hypersaline brines with total dissolved salt contents in excess of 200 g kg- 1. An accurate and precise characterization of the major ion chemistry of a natural brine is fundamental to an understanding of its geochemical evolution, the current state of mineral equilibria in solution and in the sediment, the prediction of physicochemical properties such as density and activity coefficients, and the accurate determination of <b>absolute</b> <b>salinity.</b> However, the accurate and reproducible analysis of the major ions in concentrated, multicomponent brines is often problematic, and obtaining a satisfactory ion balance between anions and cations is not a trivial task. Methods for the determination of the major ionic components of sea water and marine-type brines (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, chloride, sulphate, bromide, and total alkalinity) were investigated and a set of suitable methods was adopted for the characterization of the brines of the Vestfold Hills. The methods employed were mainly classical 'wet chemistry' techniques and include potentiometric and photometric titration along with conventional titrimetry, gravimetry, colorimetry, and flame atomic emission and absorption spectrometry. The reliability of the set of methods was demonstrated by determining precise major ion composition profiles for 36 brine samples collected from 10 hypersaline lakes, with a mean absolute ion balance error of only 0. 09 ± 0. 07...|$|E

The cruise lasted from May 1, 2016 to June 3, 2016 and 19 vertical CTD-hauls were conducted. The CTD system used during this cruise was a Sea-Bird Electronics Inc. SBE 911 plus probe (SN 09 - 1266). The CTD was attached to a SBE 32 Carousel Water Sampler (SN 32 - 1119) containing 24 20 -liter Ocean Test Equipment Inc. bottles. The system was equipped with double temperature (SBE 3) and conductivity sensors (SBE 4), a pressure sensor (Digiquartz) an oxygen (Aanderaa Optode 4831 F) and, an altimeter (Bentos) and a chlorophyll fluorometer combined with a turbidity sensor (FluoroWetlabECO _AFL FL). The sensors were pre-calibrated by the manufacturers. The data were recorded with the Seasave V 7. 23. 2 software and processed using the SeaBird SBE Data Processing and the ManageCTD-software. The data were processed in the following way: Data obtained during adaptation of the CTD to ambient water conditions were removed manually. The "wildedit", "loopedit", "despike", "binavg" routines were applied. The data were also visually checked and a double sensor check was conducted. The accuracy of the double sensors derived from 56 data sets were: Temperature T = 0. 0007 °C; Conductivity: C = 0, 0071 mS/cm; Salinity S = 0. 0081 psu.

40|$|At {{the present}} time, {{little is known}} about how broad {{salinity}} and temperature ranges are for seawater thermodynamic models that are functions of <b>absolute</b> <b>salinity</b> (S A), temperature (T) and pressure (P). Such models rely on fixed compositional ratios of the major components (e. g. Na/Cl, Mg/Cl, Ca/Cl, SO 4 /Cl, etc.). As seawater evaporates or freezes, solid phases (e. g. CaCO 3 (s) or CaSO 4 2 H 2 O(s)) will eventually precipitate. This will change the compositional ratios, and these salinity models will no longer be applicable. A future complicating factor is the lowering of seawater pH as the atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 increase. A geochemical model (FREZCHEM) was used to quantify the S A -T boundaries at P = 0. 1 MPa and the range of these boundaries for future atmospheric CO 2 increases. An omega supersaturation model for CaCO 3 minerals based on homogeneous nucleation was extended from 25 – 40 °C to 3 °C. CaCO 3 minerals were the boundary defining minerals (first to precipitate) between 3 °C (at S A = 104 g kg - 1 and 40 °C (at S A = 66 g kg - 1. At 2. 82 °C, calcite(CaCO 3) transitioned to ikaite(CaCO 3 6 H 2 O) as the dominant boundary defining mineral for colder temperatures, which culminated in a low temperature boundary of − 4. 93 °C. Increasing atmospheric CO 2 from 385 μatm (in Year 2008) to 550 μatm (in Year 2100) would increase the S A and t boundaries as much as 11 g kg − 1 and 0. 66 °C, respectively. The model-calculated calcite-ikaite transition temperature of 2. 82 °C is in excellent agreement with ikaite formation in natural environments that occurs at temperatures of 3 °C or lower. Furthermore, these results provide a quantitative theoretical explanation (FREZCHEM model calculations) for why ikaite is the solid phase CaCO 3 mineral that precipitates during seawater freezing...|$|E

According to modern observation, interannual variations in SSS during summer in the northern ECS are mainly controlled by the Changjiang (Yangtze River) discharge, which reflects summer rainfall in its drainage basin. Thus, changes in the summer SSS in the northern ECS are interpreted as reflecting variations in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) precipitation in the Changjiang Basin. This interpretation is confirmed by a strong relationship between the SSS in the northern ECS and the Changjiang discharge during the wet season (May–October) based on instrumental salinity records from 1951 to 2000. However, {{it is difficult to}} estimate <b>absolute</b> <b>salinity</b> values in the past with high accuracy, because the past salinity–δ 18 O w regression slope, end member salinity, and δ 18 O w values are not well understood. Here, we conduct δ 18 O w mass-balance calculation to estimate the freshwater contribution to the surface water of the northern ECS during the last 7 kyr by assuming a simple mixing between two end members – the seawater and the Changjiang freshwater. The result indicates that there has been no gradual decreasing secular trend in the Changjiang freshwater flux from the middle Holocene to the present day, suggesting that summer insolation in the Northern Hemisphere does not regulate the EASM precipitation in the Changjiang Basin. Instead, internal feedback appears to have been more important during the Holocene. The absence of a decreasing trend in regional summer precipitation over the Changjiang Basin since the middle Holocene is contradictory to Chinese speleothems' δ 18 O records, suggesting that {{it is not possible to}} explain orbital changes in Chinese speleothems' δ 18 O during the Holocene by changes in summer precipitation, but that such changes are related to other factors such as changes in the moisture source...|$|E

Temporal variations in the relative contribution of the freshwater from the Changjiang indicates that there was no long-term decreasing trend in the Changjiang freshwater discharge since the middle Holocene, but centennial to millennial scale variations were predominant. This suggests that changes in summer insolation in the Northern Hemisphere did not mainly control the changes in summer precipitation in the South China.

The aim of the mission is to provide Sea Surface Salinity and Soil Moisture observations, with a spatial resolution of 30 - 50 km, and an accuracy suited for climate studies. From the brightness temperature observations, experimental sea surface salinity (SSS) and Soil Moisture (SM) maps are being developed and distributed at the SMOS Barcelona Expert Center (SMOS-BEC) to take the most out of SMOS observations. Data are distributed in NetCDF format using THREDDS and maps are served through a Web Map Service (ncWMS), both at the SMOS-BEC distribution data website ([URL] For ocean applications the following SSS products are being served at spatial resolution of 0. 25 °: * Level 3 maps by spatial and temporal weighted average of level 2 SSS data. Three- and nine-day averaged maps are produced every 3 days. Monthly, seasonal and annual maps are also computed. * Level 3 maps from optimal interpolation of level 2 SSS data. Nine-day averaged maps are produced every 3 days, as well as monthly, seasonal and annual maps. * Level 4 maps from SMOS SSS fused with satellite-derived SST [1]. Similar to Level 3 data, nine-day averaged maps are produces every 3 days, as well as monthly, seasonal and annual maps. * Singularity Exponents products obtained by applying singularity analysis on OSTIA SST products ([URL] are also served. Three versions of each product are generated using ascending passes, descending passes, and full orbit passes (i. e., ascending + descending). Both <b>absolute</b> <b>salinity</b> value and its anomaly (difference between the absolute value and climatology data (WOA 2009)) are stored in the product. L 3 and L 4 maps are validated with near-surface measurements provided by Argo profilers, and their expected accuracy is 0. 2 - 0. 4 depending on processing level and the region of interest. For land applications, SMOS spatial resolution has proved useful for improving our understanding of water and energy fluxes between the atmosphere, the soil surface, and subsurface. Still, it is insufficient for regional applications, such as land and water resources management or drought mitigation, which require a spatial resolution of 1 to 10 km. For this reason, a downscaling algorithm which combines SMOS with MODIS VIS/IR satellite data into 1 km SM maps has been implemented at SMOS-BEC [2]. High resolution (1 km) soil moisture maps are derived with this technique over the Iberian Peninsula and are distributed through SMOS-BEC maps server web page in near real time (delay < 6 h).

40|$|Subantarctic New Zealand is an oceanographycally dynamic {{region with}} the Subtropical Front (STF) {{to the north}} and the Subantarctic Front (SAF) to the south. This thesis investigates the ocean {{structure}} of the Campbell Plateau and the surrounding New Zealand subantarctic, including the spatial, seasonal, interannual and longer term variability over the ocean properties, and their connection to atmospheric variability using a combination of in-situ oceanographic measurements and remote sensing data. The spatial and seasonal oceanographic structure in the New Zealand subantarctic region was investigated by analysing ten high resolution Conductivity Temperature and Depth (CTD) datasets, sampled during oceanographic cruises from May 1998 to February 2013. Position of fronts, water mass structure and changes over the seasons show a complex structure around the Campbell Plateau combining the influence of subtropical and subantarctic waters. The spatial and interannual variability on the Campbell Plateau was described by analysing approximately 70 low resolution CTD profiles collected each year in December between 2002 and 2009. Conservative temperature and <b>absolute</b> <b>salinity</b> profiles reveal high variability in the upper 200 m of the water column and a homogeneous water column from 200 to 600 m depth. Temperature variability of about 0. 7 °C, on occasions between consecutive years, is observed down to 900 m depth. The presence of Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) on the Campbell Plateau is confirmed and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) reported {{for the first time in}} the deeper regions around the edges of the plateau. Long-term trends and variability over the Campbell Plateau were investigated by analysing satellite derived Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) time series. Links to large scale atmospheric processes are also explored through correlation with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM). SST shows a strong seasonality and interannual variability which is linked to local winds, but no significant trend is found. The SLA over the Campbell Plateau has increased at a rate of 5. 2 cm decade⁻¹ in the last two decades. The strong positive trend in SLA appears to be a combination of the response of the ocean to wind stress curl (Ekman pumping), thermal expansion and ocean mass redistribution via advection amongst others. These results suggest that the variability on the Campbell Plateau is influenced by the interaction of the STF and the SAF. The STF influence reaches the limit of the SAF over the western Campbell Plateau and the SAF influence extends all around the plateau. Results also suggest different connections between the plateau with the surrounding oceans, e. g., along the northern edge with the Bounty Trough and via the southwest edge with the SAF. A significant correlation with SOI and little correlation with SAM suggest a stronger response to tropically driven processes in the long-term variability on the Campbell Plateau. The results of this thesis provide a new definitive assessment of the circulation, water masses and variability of the Campbell Plateau on mean, annual, and interannual time scales which will support research in other disciplines such as palaeoceanography, fisheries management and climate...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{understand}} the relationship between surface freshwater and heat fluxes, (interior) ocean mixing and the resulting changes in the ocean circulation and distribution of water-masses. The ocean circulation is analysed in <b>Absolute</b> <b>Salinity</b> (SA) and Conservative Temperature (SA) coordinates. It is separated into 1) an advective component related to geographical displacements in the direction normal to SA and ⊖ iso-surfaces, and quantified by the advective thermohaline streamfunction Ψadv/SA⊖, and 2) into a local component, related to local changes in SA and ⊖ values, without a geographical displacement, and quantified by the local (temporal) thermohaline streamfunction Ψloc/SA⊖. In this decomposition, the sum of the advective and local components of the circulation is given by the diathermohaline streamfunction Ψdia/SA⊖ and {{is directly related to the}} salt and heat fluxes of the surface forcing and ocean mixing. Interpretations of the streamfunctions is given and it is argued that the diathermohaline streamfunction provides a powerful tool for the analysis of and comparison amongst numerical ocean models and observational-based gridded climatologies. The relation between Ψdia/SA⊖ and fluxes of salt and heat is expressed as the Thermohaline Inverse Method (THIM). The THIM uses conservation statements for volume, salt and heat in (SA, ⊖) coordinates to express the unknown Ψdia/SA⊖ as surface freshwater and heat fluxes, and mixing parameterised by a down-gradient epineutral diffusion coefficient, and an isotropic down-gradient turbulent diffusion coeffcient of small scale mixing processes. The resulting system of equations that is solved in the THIM is tested against a numerical model and shown to provide accurate estimates of the unknowns (	Ψdia/SA⊖, and the epineutral and small-scale diffusion coefficients). The THIM has been applied to observations to obtain constrained estimates of the epineutral and small-scale diffusion coefficients and Ψdia/SA⊖. New insights in Ψdia/SA⊖ are revealed and the estimate of small-scale diffusion coefficient compares well with previous estimates. The estimates of the epineutral diffusion coefficient is about 50 times smaller than those typically used in coarse resolution climate models, suggesting that either the surfaces fluxes that are used under-estimate the production of epineutral anomalies of SA and ⊖) or the epineutral diffusion coefficients commonly used in climate models are too large. The geometry of interior ocean mixing is analysed and it is found that under the smallslope approximation there is a small gradient of tracer in a direction in which there is no actual epineutral gradient of tracer. The difference between the correct epineutral tracer gradient and the small-slope approximation to it, is quantified and it is shown that it points in the direction of the thermal wind. The fraction of the epineutral flux in this direction is very small and is negligible for all foreseeable applications. Smallscale mixing processes act to diffuse tracers isotropically (i. e. directionally uniformly in space), hence it is a misnomer to call this process 'dianeutral diffusion'. Both realisations affect the diffusion tensor, and a more concise diffusion tensor is derived for use in ocean models. The techniques, diagnostics and insights presented in this thesis lead to increased understanding of the relationship between ocean circulation and water-mass transformation due to ocean mixing and surface uxes, and result in enhanced ability to model the ocean and its role in the climate system...|$|E
