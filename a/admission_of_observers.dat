5000|$|China {{has been}} an {{observer}} of the Arctic Council since May 2013. At the 2009 ministerial meeting in Tromsø, China requested Permanent Observer status. The request was denied at least partly because members could not agree {{on the role of}} Observer States. In 2011, the Arctic Council clarified its criteria for <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>observers,</b> most notably including a requirement of applicants to [...] "recognize Arctic States’ sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the Arctic" [...] and [...] "recognize that an extensive legal framework applies to the Arctic Ocean including, notably, the Law of the Sea, and that this framework provides a solid foundation for responsible management of this ocean". China's request was approved at the next Arctic Council ministerial meeting in May 2013. Permanent observer status would allow presentation of their perspective, but not voting.|$|E

2500|$|... the People's Republic of China {{had used}} its Security Council veto eight times, fewer than other {{countries}} with the veto: in 1972 {{to veto the}} <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> Bangladesh (which it recognized as a province of Pakistan), in 1973 (in conjunction with the Soviet Union) to veto a resolution on the ceasefire in the Yom Kippur War, in 1997 to veto ceasefire observers to Guatemala (which recognised the ROC as the legitimate government of China), in 1999 to veto an extension <b>of</b> <b>observers</b> to the Republic of Macedonia (same), in 2007 (in conjunction with Russia) to veto criticizing Myanmar (Burma) on its human rights record, in 2008 (with Russia) to veto sanctions against Zimbabwe, in 2011 (with Russia) to veto sanctions against Syria, and in February 2012 (with Russia) to veto {{for the second time}} a draft resolution calling for foreign military intervention in Syria.|$|R
30|$|Because {{observers}} {{had different}} abilities and biases, and more observers {{could lead to}} more complete counts, we checked for an effect <b>of</b> <b>observer</b> identity and observer number before proceeding with analyses. There was no observer effect on estimates of human activity or wrack. Both number of other waterbird species seen and gull abundance increased with the number <b>of</b> <b>observers.</b> Also, the abundance of shorebirds and other species varied by <b>observer.</b> Therefore, number <b>of</b> <b>observers</b> and observer identity {{were added to the}} statistical models to help control for this variation. However, to simplify the statistical results, we only report the main effects <b>of</b> interest (<b>observer</b> effects are listed in the statistical tables).|$|R

At the close of the work there was proposed a model of efficient use of specialists of radiotherapy departments of hospitals (e. g. the faculty hospitals) for preparedness of hospitals for the mass <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> casualties...|$|R
2500|$|This {{postponed}} the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> Mongolia until 1961, {{when the}} Soviet Union agreed to lift its veto on the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> Mauritania, {{in return for}} the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> Mongolia. Faced with pressure from nearly all the other African countries, the ROC relented under protest. Mongolia and Mauritania were both admitted to the UN on 27 October 1961.

The only veto cast by the ROC during its membership in the UN was in 1955, against the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> Mongolia. Thus, Mongolia was excluded from the UN until 1960, when the Soviet Union announced that unless Mongolia was admitted, it would block the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> all of the newly independent African states.

40|$|When direct {{observations}} {{are used to}} study animal behavior the presence <b>of</b> the <b>observer</b> may alter the animal and hence influence the data being collected, yet few studies have quantified this effect. We conducted direct observation studies in the glasshouse to assess the relative influence <b>of</b> <b>observer</b> presence {{on the behavior of}} Pacific damsel bugs, Nabis kinbergii, a potentially important predator of crop pests. Comparisons of predator activity, predator distribution, prey (Helicoverpa armigera) mortality and prey distribution between frequently observed and minimally observed treatments, during diurnal and nocturnal observation sessions showed that the frequency <b>of</b> <b>observer</b> presence had no apparent impact on Pacific damsel bug behavior. This is the first documented test of the impact <b>of</b> <b>observer</b> presence in an insect system. To place our results in context, we reviewed 15 papers on the influence <b>of</b> <b>observer</b> presence in a range of animals. We established that just over half of these papers found evidence for an effect. Nevertheless, {{direct observations}} should be useful in further studies of Pacific damsel bug behavior, and researchers using direct observations to study the behavior of other animals should be cognizant <b>of</b> <b>observer</b> effects during design and interpretation of their study...|$|R
40|$|This paper extends and generalizes recent {{results on}} the {{characterization}} and parametrization <b>of</b> <b>observers</b> for linear systems in the behavioral framework. We formulate the results {{in the language of}} quotient signal modules that was developed by Oberst and first used in the context <b>of</b> <b>observer</b> theory by the first author. The resulting characterization <b>of</b> <b>observers</b> in terms <b>of</b> a generalized internal model principle is both elegant and concise. It includes all such results known to the authors as special cases, including the classical results for linear time-invariant state space systems. Moreover, this new characterization <b>of</b> <b>observers</b> leads to a clean and simple one-to-one parametrization result with only free parameters. This new parametrization allows to decide certain additional observer properties (such as input/output structure or nonintrusiveness) purely by inspection...|$|R
