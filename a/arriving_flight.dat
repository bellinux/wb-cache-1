40|$|Airport gates {{are one of}} the {{congestion}} {{points of}} the air transportation system. When an <b>arriving</b> <b>flight</b> lands on a runway, it is possible that it cannot pull into its gate due to gate unavailability. We define this phenomenon as gate-waiting delay. This paper gives a functional analysis of gate-waiting delays at New York Laguardia airport (LGA) for 92 days in the summer of 2007. We find that daily delays are typically not problematic (less than 600 minutes in 80 days). However, in the worst days, delays can be extremely large (1200 to 2400 minutes in the worst 4 days when worst 6 delayed flights are delayed for almost 3 hours in average). In the 12 worst days, there are 9 days in which delays can be attributed to a higher gate demand than the number of existing gates. On 8 of these days, this is due to compressed arrivals. On one day, this is due to increased gate-occupancy times. Delay mitigation strategies are also discussed...|$|E

When an <b>arriving</b> <b>flight</b> lands on a runway, it is possible that it cannot pull into its gate. We define this phenomenon as gate-waiting delay. This paper analyzes the degree to which gate waiting is a problem and the functional causes of gate waiting. Analysis of flight performance data for the OEP 35 airportsa for the summer of 2007 identified that: (i) Significant gate-waiting delays, in which more than 30 % of arriving aircraft are delayed, occurred at 10 of the OEP 35 airports, (ii) major gate-waiting delays are rare events (e. g., once a month at ATL), (iii) Gate-waiting delays are usually different among major carriers due to different scheduling strategies. For example, Delta schedules more aggressively on their gate capacity (overscheduling) than JetBlue at JFK. (iv) Functional origins of gate-waiting delay included compressed arrivals, extended gate occupancy times, reduced number of gates, and inflexible queueing disciplines (across carriers and within one carrier). Many of these origins are related to schedule disruptions which are the main common factor identified in the worst days. The methodology for analysis, the results, and the implications of these results are discussed. I...|$|E

40|$|An Integer Programming {{formulation}} {{is developed}} for optimizing surface operations at Dallas-Fort Worth airport, {{with the goal}} of assessing the potential benefits of taxi route planning. The model is based on operations in the eastern half of the airport under the most frequently used configuration. The focus is on operational concepts that optimize taxi routes by utilizing different control points on the airport surface. The benefits of two different concepts for optimizing taxiway operations, namely controlled pushback and taxi reroutes are analyzed, for both current data and a projected data set with approximately twice the traffic density. The analysis estimates that: (1) for current traffic densities, controlled pushback would reduce the average departure taxi time by 17 % without altering runway schedule conformance, while the benefits of taxi reroutes would be minimal; and (2) for high-density operations, controlled pushback would reduce the average departure taxi time by 18 %, while incorporating taxi reroutes would reduce the average arrival taxi time by 14 %. Other benefits analyzed for these control strategies include a decrease in the average time spent in runway crossing queues. Nomenclature F set of all flights.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we develop}} a {{framework}} for analyzing airlines' operational performances under different strategic decisions. A detailed study is conducted to compare differences between a major U. S. legacy carrier and a major U. S. low-cost carrier {{in terms of their}} scheduling practices, flight-based delays and on-time performances, network operations and mix of passengers, as well as passenger delays and disruptions. One major contribution of this thesis is that the framework we develop to evaluate airlines' performances is not restricted by the availability of proprietary airline data and can be adopted to estimate itinerary-based passenger demand for any U. S. airline included in the Bureau of Transportation Statistics database. Moreover, in this thesis, we compute delay for local and connecting passengers and provide a powerful tool for scenario analysis. Further, we: (1) identify root causes of delays as well as the impact throughout the network; (2) gain insights about how passenger delay can be reduced with different scheduling practices; and (3) guide the design of on-time performance metrics. Differences in scheduling practices, network operations, passenger mix, aircraft delays, and passenger delays between different airlines arise from carrier-specific characteristics. These characteristics should be considered when designing on-time performance metrics. (cont.) Characteristics specific to the legacy carrier are: (1) its hubs experience heavy traffic volume and are often subject to ground delay programs (GDPs) caused by poor weather conditions; and (2) it operates banked hubs where a set of <b>arriving</b> <b>flight</b> legs are scheduled closely with a set of departing flight legs to allow passenger connections between arriving and departing flight legs. Characteristics specific to the low-cost carrier are: (1) it tends to fly into locations that are less impacted by weather conditions and less frequently subjected to GDPs; (2) passenger traffic is distributed more evenly in the system, unlike the case of the legacy carrier in which a much larger portion of passengers connect through the major hubs; and (3) it has depeaked schedules at the major airports which allow the carrier to achieve higher efficiency in turning aircraft. Another important distinction between the two airlines that needs to be considered when designing on-time performance metrics is: the ratio of passenger delay (especially disrupted passenger delay) to operated flight delay for the low-cost carrier was higher than the corresponding value for the legacy carrier. This difference indicates that flight-specific on-time performance metrics that ignore airline heterogeneity can be an inaccurate measure of passenger experiences. In this thesis, scenario representations pertaining to various levels of airport traffic under different weather conditions are analyzed within our framework. We measure passenger delays (that is, the positive difference between the actual arrival time of the passenger at his/her destination and the scheduled arrival time) and passenger disruptions, with a passenger disruption defined as a passenger who is re-booked on an itinerary other than that planned due to a missed connection or flight cancellation. (cont.) Our results show that for the legacy carrier, an increase in flight operations of one percent on the "high-delay" day translates to an increase in the percentage of disrupted passengers (average disrupted passenger delay) of 22. 2 % (3. 1 %); for the low-cost carrier, an increase in flight operations of one percent only increases the percentage of disrupted passengers (average disrupted passenger delay) by 12. 3 % (2. 7 %). The above statistics suggest that under poor weather conditions, increasing flight operations at busy airports, compared to non-congested airports, can cause a much greater increase in passenger delay and disruptions when airport capacity is reduced by adverse weather condition. by Ying Zhu.
