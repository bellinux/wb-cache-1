5|$|A life-size {{model of}} the light cycle was put on display at a booth at Fan Expo 2009 in Toronto, Ontario from August 28–30, 2009, along with a special {{presentation}} of material from the production. The conceptual art shown at Comic-Con was shown in the session, along with some test film of the martial artists who play a more athletic style of Disc Wars. A segment from the film showed Flynn's son entering the now-decrepit arcade, playing a Tron stand-up arcade video game, noticing a passage in {{the wall behind the}} Tron game and entering it, the passage closing behind him. Flynn's son makes the visit to the arcade after Alan Bradley receives <b>a</b> <b>page</b> <b>from</b> the disconnected phone number of the arcade. The footage was used later as part of the trailer released on March 5, 2010.|$|E
5|$|By 1940, the {{collections}} {{at the library}} had increased to total of about 130,000 and 1,400 serials. Included in {{the collections}} were a variety of rare items, such as <b>a</b> <b>page</b> <b>from</b> the 1642 printing of the Polychronicon, a 1628 book of poems written in Latin, and a 1769 bible printed by John Baskerville, among others. At that time the building was open from 7:50 am until 10 pm on weekdays, and 2 pm to 5 pm on Sundays. Construction on the new wing of the library started in 1940 and was designed by John V. Bennes, the same architect who designed the original structure. He also designed a matching wing {{for the other side}} as well, but that wing was never added.|$|E

25|$|The plays The Merchant of Venice and A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare both {{influenced}} Breaking Dawn. Meyer {{decided that}} Alice would write her instruction to Bella on <b>a</b> <b>page</b> <b>from</b> The Merchant of Venice {{to give a}} clue that the final confrontation {{at the end of}} the book would be a mental one—not a physical battle—like the one {{at the end of the}} play. It also hints that the novel would have a happy ending for the couples, as in The Merchant of Venice.

25|$|A {{particular}} difficulty posed the logistical problems {{of handling the}} several thousand logographs whose command is required for full literacy in Chinese language.

The commentary is heavily ironic, with the headline reading Ce que disent les cubes... (What the cubes say...).|$|E

25|$|Before {{his next}} session with Melfi, Tony rips out <b>a</b> <b>page</b> <b>from</b> a cooking {{magazine}} in the waiting room. Melfi exhibits hostility towards Tony throughout the session, sarcastically suggesting aggressiveness for his problems. Tony takes offense, which prompts Melfi to suggest referring him to a different therapist. Tony attempts to defuse the argument, but Melfi insists they are done and uses Tony's action of ripping out the magazine page {{as an example of}} his disrespect and lack of seriousness to therapy. Although he recently said he wanted to quit therapy himself, Tony is still aghast that Melfi would end their sessions not long after his son attempted suicide. Before leaving, Tony demonstratively puts the page back into the magazine and leaves. Melfi closes the door, symbolically ending her professional relationship with Tony.|$|E
25|$|President Menem {{had already}} privatized the state telecom concern and {{national}} airlines (the once-premier airline in Latin America, Aerolíneas Argentinas, which was later almost {{run into the}} ground). The stability Cavallo's plan helped bring about, however, opened prospects for more privatizations than ever. Going on to total over 200 state enterprises, these included: the costly state railroads concern, the state oil monopoly YPF, several public utilities, two government television stations, 10,000km (6000mi) of roads, steel and petrochemical firms, grain elevators, hotels, subways and even racetracks. A panoply of provincial and municipal banks were sold to financial giants abroad (sometimes over the opposition of their respective governors and mayors) and, taking <b>a</b> <b>page</b> <b>from</b> the Chile pension system privatization, the mandatory National Pension System was opened to choice through the authorization of private pension schemes.|$|E
25|$|Founded in 1910 by English expatriates William T. Thomas and {{his brother}} Oliver W.

At the Livingston County Picnic in 1912 The Thomas Brothers Hydro-aeroplane was {{scheduled}} to fly the first Hydro-aeroplane in Livingston County but later reported the winds prevented the flight. During 1913, the company operated the affiliated Thomas Brothers School of Aviation at Conesus Lake, McPherson Point in Livingston County, New York state(taking <b>a</b> <b>page</b> <b>from</b> Glenn Curtiss, who did much the same at Keuka Lake). In 1913, the name became Thomas Brothers Aeroplane Company and based in Ithaca, New York. December 7, 1914 the company moved to Ithaca.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, Alexis Nour was residing in neutral Romania, active within the Viața Românească circle from his new home in Iași. Like other {{members of this group}} (and primarily its founder Stere), he campaigned in favor of rapprochement with the Central Powers, recommending a war on Russia for the recovery of Bessarabia. Nour thought further than his colleagues, speculating about an alliance of interests between Romanians and Ruthenians (Ukrainians). His essay Problema româno-ruteană. O pagină din marea restaurare a națiunilor ("The Romanian-Ruthenian Issue. <b>A</b> <b>Page</b> <b>from</b> the Great Restoration of Nations"), published by Viața Românească in its October–November–December 1914 issue, inaugurated a series of such pieces, which talked about Ukraine's emancipation, the Bessarabian union, and, unusually in this context, the incorporation of Transnistria into Romania (with a new frontier on the Southern Bug).|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 2 April 2012, Pécsi Újság called into question whether Gyurcsány submitted a diploma thesis. István Geresdi, Dean of the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Pécs told Pécsi Újság that {{they were unable to}} find Gyurcsány's diploma thesis. He further added that Gyurcsány's thesis was the only missing work from that time period. On 3 April Gyurcsány published <b>a</b> <b>page</b> <b>from</b> his course record book that stated that he submitted and defended a college thesis. He also stated {{that he did not know}} where his own copy of his thesis was, but he would make efforts to locate and publish it. After two weeks, on 13 April he announced that he failed to find his copy of the thesis. On 27 April Hír TV, a government-leaning television channel announced that they have found evidence that Szabolcs Rozs, who was Gyurcsány's brother-in-law in 1984, submitted a college thesis at the same college and department as Gyurcsány, with a title identical to Gyurcsány's work, in 1980. Three days later, on 30 April Hír Tv announced that they have located and compared the reviews of both Rozs's and Gyurcsány's work, and found that based on the common errors and omissions, the two texts are likely to be identical, supporting the allegations of plagiarism.|$|E
25|$|At this time, the Hoyas {{borrowed}} <b>a</b> <b>page</b> <b>from</b> Villanova's offensive {{strategy and}} started running {{the four corners}} offense, with the hopes of causing the Wildcats to abandon their regular defense and shift to man-to-man coverage. The team's plan was foiled when a pass by Bill Martin deflected out of bounds off the shin of Broadnax. Under 30 seconds had gone off the clock when the Wildcats regained the ball. Villanova resumed their ball-control offense, and took the lead with 2:37 remaining on a made shot by Jensen; the Wildcats had taken 62 seconds to run the play. Jensen's shot was the last attempted by Villanova in the game; all of the team's remaining points came on free throws. The Wildcats scored the next four points and were up 59–54 going into the final 84 seconds. Although the team was unsuccessful on multiple one-and-one free throw attempts, they added seven more points in the final portion of the game. The last made free throw, on the second of two attempts by Pressley, gave the Wildcats a 66–62 advantage with approximately 10 seconds on the clock. A shot by Michael Jackson brought the Hoyas to within two points in the closing seconds. Wingate stopped the clock from expiring by hitting {{the ball out of}} play with two seconds left. Jensen inbounded the ball to McClain, who had gone to the floor, and McClain kept possession until time expired and the Wildcats won the game and the Division I national championship, 66–64.|$|E
