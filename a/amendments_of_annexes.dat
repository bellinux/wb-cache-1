40|$|Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission members {{seeking to}} {{implement}} MARPOL 73 / 78 Annex IV amendments which recognize the Baltic Sea as special are, in which discharge of uncommitted sewage from passenger ships is forbidden, {{must ensure that}} ports are equipped with adequate reception facilities. To ensure implementation <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Annex</b> IV in port of Klaipeda, the analysis framework model was defined by authors. The model evaluates the readiness of the port to changes brought by the <b>amendments</b> <b>of</b> MARPOL <b>Annex</b> IV. The scientific problem comes with perception of adequacy. Resolution MEPC. 200 (62) amending MARPOL 73 / 78 Annex IV states, that port reception facilities must be adequate {{to the needs of}} passenger ships using them without causing undue delay. Concept of adequacy is not defined, therefore other guidelines explaining adequacy were used: EU directive 2000 / 59 /EC and IMO resolution MEPC. 83 (44) Guidelines for ensuring adequacy of port reception facilities. Based on these sources, criteria that must be met to ensure adequacy were identified and tested in article: 1) reception facilities meet needs of ships normally using them; 2) discharge of sewage does to cause undue delay; 3) reception facilities does not provide disincentive to use them; 4) facilities are accessible; 5) facilities contribute to the improvement of the marine environment...|$|R

When carrying out an environmental risk assessment (ERA) of the GMO in question, the applicant has to follow the respective legislative provisions, in particular <b>Annex</b> II <b>of</b> Directive 2001 / 18 /EC which lies down the principles for the ERA, and the Commission’s guidance notes supplementing Annex II [4], {{as well as the}} <b>amendments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Annex</b> II and III [5]. In addition, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issued guidance documents for the ERA of GMOs (e.g. [6 – 9]).

40|$|According {{to a study}} {{conducted}} by the International Maritime organisation (IMO) shipping sector is responsible for 3. 3 % of the global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol calls upon states to pursue limitation or reduction of emissions of GHG from marine bunker fuels working through the IMO. In 2011, 14 years after the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol, the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the IMO has adopted mandatory energy efficiency measures for international shipping which can be treated as the first ever mandatory global GHG reduction instrument for an international industry. The MEPC approved an <b>amendment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Annex</b> VI <b>of</b> the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73 / 78) to introduce a mandatory Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for new ships and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) for all ships. Considering the growth projections of human population and world trade the technical and operational measures {{may not be able to}} reduce the amount of GHG emissions from international shipping in a satisfactory level. Therefore, the IMO is considering to introduce market-based mechanisms that may serve two purposes including providing a fiscal incentive for the maritime industry to invest in more energy efficient manner and off-setting of growing ship emissions. Some leading developing countries already voiced their serious reservations on the newly adopted IMO regulations stating that by imposing the same obligation on all countries, irrespective of their economic status, this amendment has rejected the Principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibility (the CBDR Principle), which has always been the cornerstone of international climate change law discourses. They also claimed that negotiation for a market based mechanism should not be continued without a clear commitment from the developed counters for promotion of technical co-operation and transfer of technology relating to the improvement of energy efficiency of ships. Against this backdrop, this article explores the challenges for the developing counters in the implementation of already adopted technical and operational measures...|$|R

It is the opinion of the Court that the first sentence in Article 29, s. 4, sub-s. 3 of the Constitution must be construed as an authorisation given to the State not only to join the Communities as they stood in 1973, but also to join in <b>amendments</b> <b>of</b> the Treaties so long as such amendments do not alter the essential scope or objectives of the Communities.
