40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Asphaltene</b> {{precipitation}} and deposition is {{a serious}} problem in many Iranian fields. The deposited <b>asphaltene</b> results in partial or total blockage of the wellbore and wellstring reducing or completely seizing oil production. This paper studies the <b>asphaltene</b> problem and mitigation methods in wellstring systematically. It presents new approach based on the combination of thermodynamic modeling of <b>asphaltene</b> precipitation with hydrodynamic well modeling. The developed model is capable to determine the <b>asphaltene</b> precipitation and deposition interval through the wellstring. Therefore, it could study the effect of hydrodynamic parameters such as wellhead pressure, well flow-rate and tubing size on the mitigation of <b>asphaltene</b> deposition. The conventional way to treat <b>asphaltene</b> deposition was through remediation which attacks the problem after it occurs. This model is capable to determine the severity of <b>asphaltene</b> deposition even before start of production. The model was applied to simulate the <b>asphaltene</b> precipitation in one of the south Iranian oil fields (Kupal) and important guidelines have been studied to mitigate the risks associated with <b>asphaltene</b> deposition.

40|$|<b>Asphaltene,</b> the {{heaviest}} and most polarizable fraction of crude oil, has a potential to precipitate, deposit and plug pipelines, causing considerable production costs. The main {{objective of this}} study is to contribute to the thermodynamic and transport modeling of <b>asphaltene</b> in order to predict its precipitation, segregation and deposition. Potential calculation of some thermophysical properties of <b>asphaltene</b> is also explored. Predicting the flow assurance issues caused by <b>asphaltene</b> requires the ability to model the phase behavior of <b>asphaltene</b> as a function of pressure, temperature and composition. It has been previously demonstrated that the Perturbed Chain form of Statistical Association Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) equation of state can accurately predict the phase behavior of high molecular weight compounds including that of <b>asphaltene.</b> Thus, a PC-SAFT crude oil characterization methodology is proposed to examine the <b>asphaltene</b> phase behavior under different operating conditions. With the fluid being well characterized at a particular reservoir depth, a compositional grading algorithm can be used to analyze the compositional grading related to <b>asphaltene</b> using PC-SAFT equation of state. The <b>asphaltene</b> compositional grading that can lead in some cases to the formation of a tar mat is studied using the same thermodynamic model.

The experimental results regarding different mixing ratios illustrate that deposition increases with the increasing of the concentration of n-heptane. Continuous <b>asphaltene</b> deposition can be represented by light intensity in terms of experimental elapsed time.
