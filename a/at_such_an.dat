5|$|Born on July 18, 1913, in Vincennes, Indiana, Richard Skelton was {{the fourth}} and {{youngest}} son of Ida Mae (née Fields) and Joseph Elmer Skelton. Joseph, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; {{he had once been}} a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. During Skelton's lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> early age, Skelton may have claimed he was older than he actually was in order to gain employment. Vincennes neighbors described the Skelton family as being extremely poor; a childhood friend remembered that her parents broke up a youthful romance between her sister and Skelton because they thought he had no future.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his growing}} talent, Prokofiev's parents hesitated over {{starting}} their son on a musical career <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> early age, {{and considered the}} possibility of his attending a good high school in Moscow. By 1904, his mother had decided instead on Saint Petersburg, and she and Prokofiev visited the then capital to explore the possibility of moving there for his education. They were introduced to composer Alexander Glazunov, {{a professor at the}} Saint Petersburg Conservatory, who asked to see Prokofiev and his music; Prokofiev had composed two more operas, Desert Islands and The Feast during the Plague, and was working on his fourth, Undina. Glazunov was so impressed that he urged Prokofiev's mother to have her son apply for admission to the Conservatory. He passed the introductory tests and enrolled that year.|$|E
5|$|Some experts {{argue that}} exposing {{children}} to television <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> early age is taking technology too far or {{that parents are}} using BabyFirst as a digital babysitter. Parents in-turn refute that argument, claiming that experts have lost touch {{with the realities of}} raising a child. BabyFirst suggests the programming is intended to be watched by parents and their children together in an interactive way. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against exposing {{children under the age of}} two to television, while a 2003 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most children under two years of age are already watching TV. According to The Washington Post, very little is known about whether young children watching television has a negative or positive effect on them.|$|E

5|$|Unusual in many aspects, the 1846Havana {{hurricane}} was {{the most}} intense of its time. Though atmospheric pressure readings in Cuba reached as low as 916mbar (27.06inHg), the meteorological historian Jose Fernandez-Partagás re-evaluated several possible pressure records, concluding that the cyclone's minimum pressure was likely closer to 938mbar (27.70inHg); even so, it maintained the title of having the lowest recorded pressure measurement until 1924, 78years later. Although no reliable wind measurements were available at the time, a separate study also estimated that it produced Category5-strength winds, making it the first known storm to strike Cuba <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> intensity. As {{a result of the}} tropical cyclone's extreme intensity, ecological and geographical features were permanently altered in many areas. Sand Key, which completely submerged {{during the course of the}} hurricane, wholly re-emerged by December of that year, albeit not in its original position; meanwhile, ecological damage remained evident for decades in Key West.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{linguists}} {{do not consider}} it likely that a Baltic-Finnic language form could have existed <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> early date. According to these views, the Finno-Ugric languages appeared in Finland and Baltic only during the Early Bronze Age (ca. 1,800 BC), if not later.|$|E

An entering driver must have fair notice that his or her contemplated conduct is forbidden by such hazard for it to be illegal.|$|E
25|$|Ny-Ålesund is host to sixteen {{permanent}} research stations run by agencies from eleven countries. In addition {{there are}} several institutions which carry out permanent research without having established their own stations. Most research is centered around environmental and earth sciences, {{taking advantage of the}} town's latitude, close access to pristine nature and relatively mild climate. Compared to other locations <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> altitude, Ny-Ålesund provides a well-developed infrastructural in terms of facilities, laboratories, access and communication.|$|E

Ensuring that the instruments functioned correctly <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> early stage in the mission allowed opportunity for multiple minor errors to be dealt with.|$|E

She was upset <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> early pregnancy, certain that it would destroy the {{closeness}} she had finally found with Elvis. She had asked him earlier if she could take birth control pills, but Elvis had insisted they weren't perfected yet. She considered abortion, and even discussed it with Elvis at one point, but both decided they could not live with themselves if they had gone through with it. Their only child, Lisa Marie, was born exactly nine months after their wedding, on February 1, 1968.|$|E
25|$|Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, {{the son of}} {{a former}} player, Seebaran first played in 1989 and was {{selected}} a year later for the 1990 ICC Trophy in the Netherlands, justifying his position <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> early age by being the best spin bowler in the tournament. He eventually played One Day International cricket for Canada at the 2003 World Cup, but has not featured for the Canadian team since then. He currently plays for the Coquitlam Windies, based in the city of Coquitlam. He is currently coaching Burnaby North Secondary in a high school cricket league in the Lower Mainland.|$|E
25|$|Tutankhamun {{was nine}} years old when he became Pharaoh and reigned for {{approximately}} ten years. In historical terms, Tutankhamun's significance {{stems from the fact that}} his reign was close to the apogee of Egypt as a world power and from his rejection of the radical religious innovations introduced by his predecessor and father, Akhenaten. Secondly, his tomb in the Valley of the Kings was discovered by Carter almost completely intact—the most complete ancient Egyptian royal tomb ever found. As Tutankhamun began his reign <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> early age, his vizier and eventual successor, Ay, was probably making most of the important political decisions during Tutankhamun's reign.|$|E

25|$|During {{a hearing}} on August 10, 2006, Haq {{surprised}} the court by indicating that he wished to enter a guilty plea on all charges. The judge refused to accept this plea before a competency hearing had been conducted. Additionally, experts consulted by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer expressed doubts as to whether Haq {{would be allowed to}} plead guilty <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> early point in the legal process because the prosecution had not yet decided whether Haq would face the death penalty. On August 16, C. Wesley Richards, Haq's attorney, told the court that Haq had changed his mind and chosen to plead not guilty. Additionally, Richards said that Haq was mentally competent to stand trial since he understood the charges against him and was capable of assisting in his own defense.|$|E
25|$|The National Public Radio investigative {{report on}} Acu-Gen {{predicted}} that parents {{may use the}} Baby Gender Mentor test {{as a basis for}} determining whether to get a sex-selective abortion. KMSP-TV interviewed genetic counselor Dr. Analia Bortz who made the same prediction. The concern is that learning the sex <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if they were hoping for a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. Americans United for Life argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if they get the results early. They say that women who want to have a specific sex will be learning the results {{at a time when it}} is safer for them to have an abortion, without the complications associated with aborting later in pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Attendees {{included}} the king, officers and other dignitaries in rows of seats, {{as well as}} half of the inhabitants of Athens in the stands. Since {{it was one of}} the first mass gatherings in the city's modern history, neither the people nor the police had any previous experience with maintaining the order <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> event. The press of that time lauded the Games as being positive, but they were a disappointment for thousands of Athenians who could not see anything from the rear stands and who did not understand this kind of event. The site was also unsuited for the sports and the weather was too cold. Moreover, the athletic competition had a more game-like than sportive character: as the competitors were not individuals who were seriously dedicated to athletics, the Organising Committee accepted the participation of workers, porters, etc., who were attracted by the monetary prizes of the Games. According to the press of the time, many comical incidents took place during the games: for instance, a policeman, who was assigned to watch over the crowds, left his post and participated in the races. Even a beggar, who pretended to be blind, participated in the races.|$|E

500|$|While {{the graphic}} {{narrative}} bears strong similarities to the comics that were proliferating {{in the early}} 20th century, Masereel's book emerged from a fine arts environment and was aimed <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> audience. [...] Its influence was felt not in comics but in the worlds of literature, film, music, and advertising. [...] Masereel's work was widely recognized with awards and exhibitions in the early 20th century, but has since been mostly forgotten outside of Western comics circles, where his wordless novels, and Passionate Journey in particular, are seen as precursors to the graphic novel.|$|E
500|$|... "O Canada" [...] is {{routinely}} played before sporting events involving Canadian teams.
