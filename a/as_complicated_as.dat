25|$|The Navier–Stokes equations, {{even when}} written {{explicitly}} for specific fluids, are rather generic {{in nature and}} their proper application to specific problems can be very diverse.

25|$|The {{next step}} is the {{restoration}} of the book cover; This can be <b>as</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>as</b> completely re-creating a period binding to match the original using whatever is appropriate for that time it was originally created. Sometimes this means a new full leather binding with vegetable tanned leather, dyed with natural dyes, and hand-marbled papers may be used for the sides or end-sheets. Finally the cover is hand-tooled in gold leaf. The design of the book cover involves such hand-tooling, where an extremely thin layer of gold is applied to the cover. Such designs can be lettering, symbols, or floral designs, depending on the nature of any particular project.|$|E
25|$|The term {{boilerplate}} {{originated from}} the use of boilerplate steel for the construction of test articles/mock-ups. Historically, during the development of the Little Joe series of 7 launch vehicles, there was only one actual boilerplate capsule and it was called such since its conical section was made of steel at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. This capsule was used in a beach abort test, and then subsequently used in the LJ1A flight. However, the term subsequently came to be used for all the prototype capsules (which in their own right were nearly <b>as</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>as</b> the orbital capsules). This usage was technically incorrect, as those other capsules were not made of boilerplate, but the boilerplate term had effectively been genericized.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{definition}} of distributions exhibits {{them as a}} subspace {{of a very large}} space, namely the topological dual of D(U) (or S(Rd) for tempered distributions). It is not immediately clear from the definition how exotic a distribution might be. To answer this question, it is instructive to see distributions built up from a smaller space, namely the space of continuous functions. Roughly, any distribution is locally a (multiple) derivative of a continuous function. A precise version of this result, given below, holds for distributions of compact support, tempered distributions, and general distributions. Generally speaking, no proper subset of the space of distributions contains all continuous functions and is closed under differentiation. This says that distributions are not particularly exotic objects; they are only <b>as</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>as</b> necessary.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{assumption}} of crevasse rescue is that {{two or more}} climbers are tied together with a climbing rope, forming a rope team; a standard number is three, one on each end {{and one in the}} middle, which means there are two available to hold a falling climber, but is not <b>as</b> <b>complicated</b> to manage <b>as</b> large numbers of people attached to a single rope.|$|R

50|$|A {{photography}} {{or paint}} triplet is {{set of three}} photos or paints usually related to one event or developing a theme or story. Many art photographers use triplets to describe more complicated story or to attract the viewer by showing related prints together. Some art critics like triplets because the best photographers are able to describe <b>as</b> <b>complicated</b> story <b>as</b> in simple documentary movie. Some triplets (called clone triplets) are the same image repeated with slight alterations (for example toned to different colors, or mixed color and monochromatic photos) or, more rarely, seemingly identical images with minor, detailed changes.|$|R
25|$|Systems <b>as</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>as</b> {{computers}} require {{very high}} reliability. ENIAC remained on, in continuous operation from 1947 to 1955, {{for eight years}} before being shut down. Although a vacuum tube might fail, it would be replaced without bringing down the system. By the simple strategy of never shutting down ENIAC, the failures were dramatically reduced. The vacuum-tube SAGE air-defense computers became remarkably reliable – installed in pairs, one off-line, tubes likely to fail did so when the computer was intentionally run at reduced power to find them. Hot-pluggable hard disks, like the hot-pluggable vacuum tubes of yesteryear, continue the tradition of repair during continuous operation. Semiconductor memories routinely have no errors when they operate, although operating systems like Unix have employed memory tests on start-up to detect failing hardware. Today, the requirement of reliable performance is made even more stringent when server farms are the delivery platform. Google has managed this by using fault-tolerant software to recover from hardware failures, and is even working {{on the concept of}} replacing entire server farms on-the-fly, during a service event.|$|E

2500|$|In Darwin's view, {{anything}} that could be expected to have some adaptive feature could be explained easily with his theory of natural selection. In On the Origin of Species, Darwin wrote that to use natural selection to explain something <b>as</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>as</b> a human eye, [...] "with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration" [...] might at first appear [...] "absurd in the highest possible degree," [...] but nevertheless, if [...] "numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist", then it seemed quite possible to account for within his theory.|$|E

2500|$|In 1975 Genie {{began to}} use a {{different}} type of serial verb construction, in sentences such as [...] "I like go ride Miss F. car". Curtiss noted that all of these were first-person utterances, that she almost never said the word I, and that she frequently used standalone verbs, such as go, which typically precede a second verb; although in several cases she said go ride and go walk, Curtiss thought Genie may have treated these as single words and were therefore not <b>as</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>as</b> they appeared. In addition, all of these sentences were in verb–(verb–verb phrase) form which Curtiss argued had no hierarchical structure, although an outside analysis argued they had contained some degree of hierarchy. In non-test settings during early 1975 Genie gave some indications, including one verbal response to David Rigler, that she grasped conditional sentences, but Curtiss said she could not be completely certain. Curtiss also noted that, despite the fact that Genie clearly understood contractions, she did not use any in her speech.|$|E

60|$|The individual's mind is, as it were, an {{isolated}} {{bit of the}} race mind. The same set of traits will be found in each. Mental characteristics there are a sort of common property, of which a certain undifferentiated portion is indiscriminately allotted to every man at birth. One soul resembles another so much, that {{in view of the}} patriarchal system under which they all exist, there seems to the stranger a peculiar appropriateness in so strong a family likeness of mind. An idea of how little one man's brain differs from his neighbor's may be gathered from the fact, that while a common coolie in Japan spends his spare time in playing a chess twice <b>as</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>as</b> ours, the most advanced philosopher is still on the blissfully ignorant side of the pons asinorum.|$|E
60|$|The third {{distinction}} {{is based on}} a completely erroneous conception of the chemical differences and resemblances between the constituents of animal and vegetable organisms, for which Cuvier is not responsible, as it was current among contemporary chemists. It is now established that nitrogen is as essential a constituent of vegetable as of animal living matter; and that the latter is, chemically speaking, just <b>as</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>as</b> the former. Starchy substances, cellulose and sugar, once supposed to be exclusively confined to plants, are now known to be regular and normal products of animals. Amylaceous and saccharine substances are largely manufactured, even by the highest animals; cellulose is widespread as a constituent of the skeletons of the lower animals; and it is probable that amyloid substances are universally present in the animal organism, though not in the precise form of starch.|$|E
60|$|Having thus ventured {{the most}} terrible {{denunciation}} he could devise, and the one which, {{in the eyes of}} the honest bee-hunter, there seemed the greatest likelihood of his being able to put in execution, he was obliged to await the fruits of his threat, with that resignation which would be apt to govern a western border-man who, in addition to the prospects just named, had the advantage of contemplating them in fetters and bondage. We shall not detain the narrative, to relate the quaint morals with which he next endeavoured to cheer the drooping spirits of his more sensitive companion, or the occasional pithy and peculiar benedictions that he pronounced, on all the bands of the Dahcotahs, commencing with those whom he accused of stealing or murdering, on the banks of the distant Mississippi, and concluding, in terms of suitable energy, with the Teton tribe. The latter more than once received from his lips curses as sententious and <b>as</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>as</b> that celebrated anathema of the church, for a knowledge of which most unlettered Protestants are indebted to the pious researches of the worthy Tristram Shandy. But as Middleton recovered from his exhaustion he was fain to appease the boisterous temper of his associate, by admonishing him of the uselessness of such denunciations, and of the possibility of their hastening the very evil he deprecated, by irritating the resentments of a race, who were sufficiently fierce and lawless, even in their most pacific moods.|$|E
