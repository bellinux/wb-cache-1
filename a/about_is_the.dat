500|$|Ordinary {{matter and}} the forces that act on matter can be {{described}} in terms of elementary particles.

2500|$|Also in the [...] "Ethics", Spinoza {{discusses}} {{his beliefs}} {{about what he}} considers to be the three kinds of knowledge that come with perceptions.

Dangerous reason lacks any type of rationality, and causes the mind to be in a “passive” state. This type of “passive mind” that Spinoza writes about in the earlier books of The Ethics is a state of the mind in which adequate causes become passions.|$|E

2500|$|What I am {{concerned}} <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> trend, common among present-day Buddhist teachers, of recasting the core {{principles of the}} Buddha's teachings into largely psychological terms and then saying, [...] "This is Dhamma." [...] When this is done we may never get {{to see that the}} real purpose of the teaching, in its own framework, is not to induce [...] "healing" [...] or [...] "wholeness" [...] or [...] "self-acceptance," [...] but to propel the mind in the direction of deliverance – and to do so by attenuating, and finally extricating, all those mental factors responsible for our bondage and suffering. We should remember that the Buddha did not teach the Dhamma as an [...] "art of living" [...] – though it includes that – but above all as a path to deliverance, a path to final liberation and enlightenment. And what the Buddha means by enlightenment is not a celebration of the limitations of the human condition, not a passive submission to our frailties, but an overcoming of those limitations by making a radical, revolutionary breakthrough to an altogether different dimension of being.|$|E
