5|$|By {{the end of}} the afternoon, nearly 300armed men had {{converged on}} the lawn of the State Capitol. Brooks' men seized the state arsenal and began turning the Statehouse into an armed camp. Telegrams covered in {{signatures}} were sent to President Ulysses S. Grant supporting Brooks as the legal governor. Three out of the five Supreme Court justices also telegraphed the President in support of Brooks. Brooks telegraphed the President himself asking for access to weapons housed at the federal arsenal. He also issued a statement to the press proclaiming himself governor. The senators from the state, Clayton and Steven Dorsey, met with President Grant, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> a message to Brooks giving their support.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{an article}} was {{published}} about the bell's submersion and resurfacing at Geneva Lake. The article interested {{the people of}} Mount Morris, Illinois, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> 12 members of their Fourth of July Committee to investigate the bell in Johnsburg. The people of Mount Morris decided to purchase the bell; a committee was formed and obtained a loan from the Mount Morris VFW. The group also collected donations from local residents to purchase the bell for US$500. By July 4, 1966, the Illinois Freedom Bell hung from the gazebo in its current location, and the two writers who first suggested bell ringing as an annual Independence Day ceremony, Eric Hatch and Eric Sloane were on hand for its dedication.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning of 17 December Milstein and Trassjonsky became {{increasingly}} concerned as Gardstein's condition worsened, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> for a local doctor, explaining that their patient had been wounded accidentally by a friend. The doctor thought the bullet was still in the chest—it was later found to be touching the right ventricle of the heart. The doctor wanted to take Gardstein to the London Hospital, but he refused; with no other course open to him, the doctor sold them pain medication and left. The Russian was dead by 9:00am that morning. The doctor returned at 11:00am and found the body. He had not heard of the events at Exchange Buildings the night before, and so reported the death to the coroner, not the police. At midday the coroner reported the death to the local police who, led by Divisional Detective Inspector Frederick Wensley, went to Grove Street and discovered the corpse. Trassjonsky was in the next room when they entered, and she was soon found by the police, hastily burning papers; she was arrested and taken to the police headquarters at Old Jewry. Many of the papers recovered linked the suspects to the East End, particularly to the anarchist groups active in the area. Wensley, who had extensive knowledge of the Whitechapel area, subsequently acted as a liaison officer to the City of London force throughout the investigation.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} obtain the Order of Saint-Louis, de Puisaye {{purchased}} a colonelcy and an honorary position in the King's guard. He married Louise Le Sesne, the sole heiress of the marquis de Ménilles, on 19 June 1788. From this marriage he obtained an estate in Pacy-sur-Eure, Normandy, and he spent his time there or in Paris. There {{he was involved in}} drafting the cahier de doléance for the nobility of Perche, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> him as their delegate to the Estates General in 1789.|$|E
25|$|Long {{distance}} flying was {{her real}} passion and in 1931 she {{seized the opportunity}} to fly to Portuguese Guinea (now Guinea-Bissau) West Africa on a scientific expedition. On the return journey, engine failure resulted in a crash-landing in the Sahara. With the help of nomadic Tuareg tribesmen, Elly joined a camel caravan to Timbuktu. She subsequently returned to the crash site to recover parts of the plane. Word of her plight reached the French authorities <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> a military two-seater plane to collect her.|$|E
25|$|According to Homer, Idomeneus {{reached his}} house safe and sound. Another {{tradition}} later formed. After the war, Idomeneus's ship hit a horrible storm. Idomeneus promised Poseidon {{that he would}} sacrifice the first living thing he saw {{when he returned home}} if Poseidon would save his ship and crew. The first living thing he saw was his son, whom Idomeneus duly sacrificed. The gods were angry at his murder of his own son <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> a plague to Crete. His people sent him into exile to Calabria in Italy, and then to Colophon, in Asia Minor, where he died. Among the lesser Achaeans very few reached their homes.|$|E

However, the Abellican Church wanted the gemstones back <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> two monks after her. The monks were defeated but Father Abbot Markwart captured her family. When she found them dead, she vowed revenge against the Church. In the next book, {{it was revealed that}} she was pregnant with Elbryan's child but it was seemingly killed during a duel with Markwart. In her rage, she fought the powerful old man again and managed to defeat and kill him. She lost her husband during this battle.|$|E
25|$|Zanet Grigorakis was {{appointed}} bey of Mani and had assumed {{the name of}} Zanetbey. He however in 1798 was plotting with French agents who were sent by Napoleon to organise a Maniot invasion of the Peloponnese while Napoleon attacked the Levant. Once the Ottomans heard this, they had Zanet disposed and outlawed. Zanet however continued {{to communicate with the}} French <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> him a shipment of weapons. Once the Ottomans heard of this, they sent an army under the command of the Capitán Pasha to lay siege to Zanet's island fort on Cranae. After a short siege Zanet fled from the forts and hid inland. The Ottomans then returned to their base in Tripoli.|$|E
25|$|On 8 February 1813, nine {{boats and}} 200 men of a British naval {{squadron}} comprising , , , and Junon captured Lottery in Lynnhaven Bay on the Chesapeake. Her crew {{put up a}} strong defense {{with the result that}} the British cutting out party suffered six men wounded, half severely or dangerously, one of whom died later; the Americans suffered 19 men wounded, including Southcomb, before they struck. Southcomb died of his wounds and his body was taken ashore. Lottery had been carrying a cargo of coffee, sugar and lumber from Baltimore to Bordeaux. The British had earlier captured the schooner Rebecca, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> her into Norfolk as a cartel with the American wounded.|$|E

25|$|The {{recovery}} of their voting rights at the Council of Castile was a goal {{shared by the}} Galician aristocracy and the kingdom's oligarchs. In 1520 the Archbishop of Santiago, Afonso III da Fonseca, and the Counts of Benavente and Andrade complained about it during {{the celebration of the}} Castilian Council in the Galician capital, Compostela, but to no avail. The involvement of Galician elites achieved an assembly between nobles and prelates of the kingdom in the town of Melide in central Galicia on December 4, 1520. This was headed by Afonso III da Fonseca, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> a new demand to the emperor {{on the subject of the}} vote, however Charles V again refused to give Galicia an independent voice.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} of the Bolsheviks towards East Prussia worried Germany, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> volunteers (Brigade Schaulen) commanded by General Rudiger von der Goltz to free {{a section of the}} Libau–Romny Railway line linking Liepāja, Mažeikiai, Radviliškis, and Kėdainiai. It {{was part of a larger}} counter-offensive in Latvia. At the end of February the Lithuanian partisans, supported by German artillery, took Mažeikiai and Seda, and pursued Bolsheviks to Kuršėnai. On February 27, 1919, German volunteers supported by Plechavičius' partisans and Joniškėlis' partisans, defeated the Samogitian Regiment in a battle near Luokė. The regiment disbanded. Before mid-March the Germans took Kuršėnai, Šiauliai, Radviliškis, Šeduva, Joniškis and stopped. On few occasions they were aided by Lithuanian partisans and regular units. Joniškėlis' partisans continued to guard the front along the Mūša River. They were later incorporated into regular Lithuanian military.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} to England, he allied himself with the Tories, and {{received}} his reward in being contrasted, much to his advantage, with the Whig victor of Blenheim and Malplaquet. The differences between the three peers, Peterborough, Galway and Tyrawley, who had served in Spain, formed the subject of angry debates in the House of Lords, when the majority declared for Peterborough; after some fiery speeches the resolution that he had performed many great and eminent services was carried, and votes of thanks were passed to him without any division (January and February 1708). His new friends were not desirous of detaining him long on English soil, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> him {{on a mission to}} Vienna, where he characteristically engaged the ministry in pledges of which they disapproved. His resentment at this disagreement was softened by the command of a cavalry regiment, and by his appointment as a Knight of the Garter (August 1713). With the accession of George I, Lord Peterborough's influence was gone. Worn out with suffering, he died at Lisbon on 25 October 1735. His remains were brought to England, and buried at Turvey in Bedfordshire on 21 November.|$|E

500|$|Hergé read {{a variety}} of books about Tibet for this project: Fosco Maraini's Secret Tibet, Heinrich Harrer's Seven Years in Tibet, Tsewang Pemba's Tibet my Homeland, Maurice Herzog's Annapurna, discredited author Lobsang Rampa's The Third Eye, and the books of Belgian {{explorer}} and spiritualist Alexandra David-Néel. Hergé visited the Belgian Alpine Society to examine their photographic collection of the Himalayas, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> him photographer Richard Lannoy's work on India. [...] Models for drawings such as of monks with musical instruments, Sherpas with backpacks, and the aircraft wreckage came from clippings Hergé had collected from sources such as National Geographic. Members of the Studios helped him gather other source material; for instance, collaborator Jacques Martin researched and drew the story's costumes.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Willkie reached age 14 and {{enrolled}} in Elwood High School, {{his parents were}} concerned about a lack of discipline and a slight stoop, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> him to Culver Military Academy for a summer {{in an attempt to}} correct both. Willkie began to shine as a student in high school, inspired by his English teacher; one classmate said that Philip [...] "Pat" [...] Bing [...] "fixed that boy up. He started preaching to Wendell to get to work and that kid went to town." [...] Faced with a set of athletic brothers—Edward became an Olympic wrestler—Willkie joined the football team but had little success; he enjoyed the debate team more, but was several times disciplined for arguing with teachers. He was class president his final year, and president of the most prominent fraternity, but resigned from the latter when a sorority blackballed his girlfriend, Gwyneth Harry, as the daughter of immigrants.|$|E
50|$|Sabanilla {{was founded}} in 1771 by 150 {{migrants}} from the surrounding villages of Moyos <b>and</b> Tila. <b>They</b> <b>sent</b> {{a letter to the}} Spanish King, Carlos III, signed by the only literate person, Matheo Diaz.

500|$|Further assaults {{were made}} on 10 May, along with a demand for Blake and his men to surrender, to which Blake responded that he [...] "had four pairs of boots left and would eat three of them before he yielded." [...] Weldon's {{relieving}} force had met with small parties of the Royalist army around Chard and Pitminster, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> an advance party ahead of them, which reached Orchard Portman, roughly [...] south of Taunton, on 10 May. Fearing that they were facing the entirety of Fairfax's army, Hopton ordered his forces to abandon their attacks and retreat to Bridgwater. As they left, they felled trees across roads to slow the Parliamentarian advance. Weldon's army arrived in Taunton on 11 May, relieving and restocking the town. Accounts of Taunton's losses vary between 50 and 200 killed, with 200 or more casualties on top of that, while {{two thirds of the}} houses in the town had been razed. Having relieved Taunton, Weldon and his army left the following day and marched eastwards.|$|E
500|$|Æthelstan {{built on}} his grandfather's efforts to revive ecclesiastical scholarship, which {{had fallen to}} a low state {{in the second half}} of the ninth century. John Blair {{described}} Æthelstan's achievement as [...] "a determined reconstruction, visible to us especially through the circulation and production of books, of the shattered ecclesiastical culture". He was renowned in his own day for his piety and promotion of sacred learning. His interest in education, and his reputation as a collector of books and relics, attracted a cosmopolitan group of ecclesiastical scholars to his court, particularly Bretons and Irish. Æthelstan gave extensive aid to Breton clergy who had fled Brittany following its conquest by the Vikings in 919. He made a confraternity agreement with the clergy of Dol Cathedral in Brittany, who were then in exile in central France, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> him the relics of Breton saints, apparently hoping for his patronage. The contacts resulted in a surge in interest in England for commemorating Breton saints. One of the most notable scholars at Æthelstan's court was Israel the Grammarian, who may have been a Breton. Israel and [...] "a certain Frank" [...] drew a board game called [...] "Gospel Dice" [...] for an Irish bishop, Dub Innse, who took it home to Bangor. Æthelstan's court played a crucial role in the origins of the English monastic reform movement.|$|E
500|$|The group {{sent out}} demo tapes to record {{companies}} but received few responses until executives at GRT Records signed the band to a one-record contract, issuing their debut single, [...] "I Want to Be with You Tonight", in 1977. GRT {{was more interested}} in the band as songwriters, and convinced the group to change their name to the Alabama Band, later shortened to Alabama. The song only reached number 78 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, and GRT declared bankruptcy the following year. Due to a hidden clause in their contract, Alabama was forbidden from recording with another label. For the next two years, the band raised money to buy out their contract and they began recording again in 1979. Following self-recorded efforts Wildcountry (1976) and Deuces Wild (1977), Alabama Band No. 3 became the band's third album, and the band performed over 300 shows on the road that year. The group hired independent radio promoters to receive radio play for the single [...] "I Wanna Come Over", <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> hand-written letters to program directors and DJs nationwide. It received the attention of Dallas-based MDJ Records, who signed the band. Scott left the group at this time, and was replaced by Mark Herndon, a rock drummer later credited with bringing the band their signature sound. [...] "I Wanna Come Over", became their first radio hit, reaching the top 40 in the Billboard country chart.|$|E
