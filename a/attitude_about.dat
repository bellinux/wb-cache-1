A demographic data form, premarital sexual permissiveness scale, parental communication about sexuality scale and parental <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> sexuality scale were administered to 366 (217 female and 148 male) college students, aged 18 to 26. The results indicated that females held more conservative premarital sexual attitudes than males; females talked to their mothers, while males talked to their fathers more about sexuality issues. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that gender was significant on the perceived maternal <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> sexuality, whereas perceived paternal <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> sexuality were not found to be significant with respect to gender.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship of pre-service teachers’ self-theories of intelligence (mindset) and their <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> Web 2. 0. The research questions evaluate: (a) Whether a significant correlation exists between pre-service teachers’ mindsets and <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> Web 2. 0 (social media), and (b) Whether significant differences exist between demographic groups (e. g., age, certification area, gender) and their <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> Web 2. 0 (social media). Results of the study indicate that a weak correlation between pre-service teachers’ perceived mindsets and perceived <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> Web 2. 0 was statistically significant. In addition, {{significant differences were found}} based upon certification area, gender, and age with the sample’s <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> Web 2. 0 tools. Future research might include the manipulation of pre-service teachers’ mindsets to measure the affect on their attitudes toward Web 2. 0. Analysis of pre-service teachers’ mindsets and <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> Web 2. 0 on a more comprehensive scale (state or national), as opposed to regional, will provide greater insights into the affect of mindsets on <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> Web 2. 0, particularly within specific demographics due to increasing the sample size.

40|$|A {{deficient}} {{safety culture}} has been implicated {{in a number of}} organisational accidents from a range of high hazard industries. Despite its implications for safety, many questions about safety culture remain unanswered. In order to contribute to the literature on this topic, this thesis set out to investigate the role of trust in safety culture. The oil and gas industry was chosen as the context for study due to the hazardous nature of its work, the industry’s focus on continuous improvement in safety performance and the interest shown by oil companies in participating in safety research. Leading models of safety culture have stressed the importance of trust in developing and maintaining patterns of safe behaviours at work. This thesis proposed a new model of safety culture based on dual <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> trust. This model states that explicit <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> trust are part of safety climate and that implicit <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> trust comprise some of the basic underlying assumptions that are the deepest level of safety culture. In order to test this model, this thesis developed a method to measure implicit <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> trust in an industrial setting. Using this method, two studies of dual <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> trust were conducted at different UK gas plants. In both of these studies, different patterns of results were found for measures of explicit and implicit <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> trust for workmates, supervisors and the plant leadership, respectively. These findings support the proposed model suggest that explicit and implicit <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> trust are separate constructs that may influence different types of safety behaviours.   Positive relationships were found between measures of explicit <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> trust and self-report items about safety behaviours like reporting incidents and challenging unsafe acts.   These findings were taken as a step toward validating the proposed model.

[...] The episode [...] "Inside Out" [...] saw the height of this inversion of Cordelia's character, where she is seen urging Connor to murder an innocent girl in order to expedite {{the birth of the}} child they conceived together. In an effort to stop Connor, the Powers That Be send the spirit of Connor's mother Darla (Julie Benz) to convince him not to go through with it. The episode sees Carpenter dressed in black, while Benz appears in heavenly white as she becomes the voice of reason and morality. Steven S. DeKnight, who wrote and directed the episode, felt this was a brilliant role-reversal for both actresses as Carpenter is accustomed to playing the benevolent Cordelia where Darla is normally seen as a sinister vampire. Much of season four's storyline had to be adjusted due to Carpenter's real-life pregnancy; after Cordelia gives birth to Jasmine in the episode [...] "Inside Out" [...] she is left in a coma {{for the remainder of the}} fourth season. Crusie discusses what she felt were the flaws in the execution of the fourth season, It's that she betrays the man she trusts above all others and who trusts her absolutely; it's that she seduces a boy she once diapered; it's that she dresses like a drag queen and talks like a Dynasty reject. It's that she's not Cordy, and what might have been fun to watch had we been let into the secret before the Beastmaster seduced Connor becomes the extended rape and death of a much-beloved character.|$|E
