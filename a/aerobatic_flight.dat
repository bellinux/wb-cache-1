It allows players to pilot reproductions of real-world aircraft and to perform aerobatic maneuvers. They may fly freely, race through floating rings against a timer or take lessons from a virtual flight instructor. The instructor teaches basic and advanced techniques, ranging from rudder turns to maneuvers such as the tailslide, Lomcevak and Immelmann turn.|$|E

2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Denison University, Lynn began working for Procter & Gamble in the 1980s, {{and became one}} of the first women to hold a {{position}} as manufacturing plant manager.

40|$|Abstract — For many applications, {{the control}} of a complex {{nonlinear}} system can be greatly aided by modeling {{the system as a}} collection of simplified hybrid modes, each representing a particular operating regime or portion of the state space. An example of this is the decomposition of complex <b>aerobatic</b> <b>flights</b> into sequences of discrete maneuvers, an approach that has proven very successful for both human piloted and autonomously controlled aircraft. However, a critical component of designing such control systems for autonomous flight is to ensure the safety and feasibility of transitions between these maneuvers. This work presents a hybrid dynamics framework for the design of guaranteed safe switching regions in performing an autonomous backflip by a quadrotor helicopter. The regions are constructed using reachable sets calculated via a Hamilton-Jacobi differential game formulation, and experimental results are presented from flight tests on the STARMAC quadrotor platform.

40|$|Abstract—Quadrotor {{helicopters}} {{have become}} increasingly important {{in recent years as}} platforms for both research and commercial unmanned aerial vehicle applications. This paper extends previous work on several important aerodynamic effects impacting quadrotor flight in regimes beyond nominal hover conditions.

The analysis and control systems are validated on the Stanford Testbed of Autonomous Rotorcraft for Multi-Agent Control quadrotor helicopter testbed by performing the quadrotor equivalent of the stall turn <b>aerobatic</b> maneuver. <b>Flight</b> results demonstrate the accuracy of the aerodynamic models and improved control performance with the proposed control schemes.

5000|$|As the {{breeding}} season approaches, wedge-tailed eagle pairs perch {{close to each}} other and preen one another. They also perform dramatic <b>aerobatic</b> display <b>flights</b> together over their territory. Sometimes, the male dives down at breakneck speed towards his partner.

The wedge-tailed eagle usually nests in the fork of a tree between one and 30 m above the ground, but if no suitable sites are available, it will nest on a cliff edge.|$|R
50|$|Strassmann first {{experienced}} flight on hot air balloon {{trips with}} her brother and cousin in 1925, and then on flying trips with a friend in 1926. In September 1927, Strassman began flying lessons at the Boornemann school in Staaken, earning her pilot license in 1928, and {{then moved on to}} learn aerobatic flying at Würzburg. However, she realised that earning an income from aviation would be difficult as women were barred from working as commercial pilots, and money from exhibition flying was insufficient for a stable income. Instead, in 1930, she made a proposal to the German Foreign Office to organise and manage a year-long touring exhibition of model and full-sized German aircraft in the United States. Her aims were to advertise German business and encourage positive German-U.S. relations. She developed agreements with the Model Airplane League of America and the Gimbel Company, and planned an itinerary to visit 12 cities. The proposal was accepted and the exhibition began in spring 1930. Strassman and her friend, pilot Koenig-von Warthausen, delivered lectures on German aviation and performed <b>aerobatic</b> <b>flights,</b> participated in air shows, visited aviation companies and gave interviews to the press. At the National Air Races in Chicago in 1930, she was invited to test 28 types of airplanes. The German Foreign Office declared the tour an absolute success, and on her return to Germany Strassmann was considered a major expert on the field of aviation, and invited to educate German industrialists and politicians, including Ernst Heinkel, Claude Dornier, Hugo Junkers, and Hugo Eckener.|$|R
