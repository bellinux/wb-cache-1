5|$|Weaver {{embarked}} on a speaking tour across the northern plains and Pacific coast states. In late August, he turned South, hoping to break the Democrats' grip on those states. As in 1880, {{the issue of race}} hurt Weaver among white Southern voters, as he sought to attract black voters by urging cooperation between white and black farmers and calling for an end to lynchings. Weaver drew good crowds in the South, but {{he and his wife were}} also subjected to <b>abuse</b> <b>from</b> hecklers. Southern Democrats depicted Weaver as a threat to the conservative Democrats in power there; with the increasing disenfranchisement of black voters, this was to prove fatal to the Populists' hopes in the South.|$|E
5|$|With {{his good}} {{academic}} reputation, several staff members {{provided him with}} work as a tutor in Ancient History in the Department of Tutorial Classes, but he was prevented from doing so by the Chancellor of the University, Sir William Cullen, who feared that Childe would propagate socialism to students. This infringement of Childe's civil rights was condemned in the leftist community, and the issue {{was brought up in}} the Parliament of Australia by centre-left politicians William McKell and T.J.

5|$|According to Sarma, Gandhi {{recruited}} {{women to}} participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because he feared he would be accused of using women as political shield. When women insisted that they join the movement and public demonstrations, according to Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him. Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal <b>abuse</b> <b>from</b> British authorities for the cause in a manner Gandhi inspired.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal <b>abuse</b> <b>from</b> their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} {{in charge of}} ethnic and religious affairs in Guangdong said that the province had hired Uygurs, aged from 18 to 29, in May.

State media confirmed that all the workers were from Shufu County. China Labor Watch reported that workers at the Shaoguan factory, where the Uyghurs were employed, earned 28 yuan per day compared with 41.3 yuan in its factory in Shenzhen. They noted that rights of workers, Han and Uyghur alike, were frequently violated by verbal <b>abuse</b> <b>from</b> factory supervisors, unpaid overtime, poor dormitory conditions and illegal labour contracts. Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch said that low pay, long hours and poor working conditions combined with the inability to communicate with their colleagues exacerbated deeply held mistrust between the Han and Uyghurs.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1987–88 season, Whiteside {{represented}} the Football League in a game against the 'Rest of the World' to celebrate the league's centenary. He formed a solid partnership with Brian McClair, scoring 10 goals in 35 appearances, though United finished second in the league behind Liverpool, and he often found himself back in midfield or on the bench when Peter Davenport was selected to play alongside McClair. However, he felt that he was due a better contract, and decided to 'call the bluff' of the club by handing in a transfer request. Recovering from injury and <b>abuse</b> <b>from</b> some supporters for his transfer request, he put what many United fans call the best performance of his career at Anfield on 4 April 1988, when he came off a substitute with his team 3–1 down to help United to salvage a point.|$|E

5|$|Kerrigan {{appears in}} several StarCraft novels that greatly expand her backstory {{before the first}} StarCraft game. The novel Uprising portrays Kerrigan's {{training}} as a Ghost assassin from an early age, where she is subjected to intense psychological <b>abuse</b> <b>from</b> her Confederate trainer, Lieutenant Rumm. When {{she was a young}} girl, an accident, most likely involving her powers, kills her mother and puts her father in a vegetative state. Consequently, Kerrigan is terrified to use her psionic abilities, and refuses Rumm's demands to show her power, even when he threatens to kill her father. Kerrigan is eventually subdued with mental implants and used as a top Confederate assassin until she is rescued by Arcturus Mengsk. The novels Liberty's Crusade and Queen of Blades provide novelisations for Kerrigan's actions in Episodes I and II of StarCraft respectively. Liberty's Crusade develops the implied relationship between Jim Raynor and Kerrigan, while Queen of Blades serves to demonstrate Kerrigan's complete transformation by the Zerg, her removal of her inhibitions and morality, and its effect on her former love, Raynor.|$|E

He scored 3 goals in 11 {{appearances}} during the 2004–05 season for Tottenham. Mido announced plans in July 2005 to launch his own football academy in Egypt, which had the aim of nurturing the country's young talent. In January 2006, he expressed {{that he did not}} wish to return to Roma {{at the end of the}} 2005–06 season, but rather sign permanently with Tottenham. Tottenham manager Martin Jol said that the club were confident of signing Mido on a permanent deal due to his good performances, but later admitted Tottenham may be defeated in keeping Mido, with other clubs interested in signing him. His permanent move was further put into doubt in April 2006, after he suffered a new injury problem. He suffered <b>abuse</b> <b>from</b> a small section of the Southampton and West Ham United fans in 2005. West Ham manager Alan Pardew apologised to Mido for the abuse by the fans. He finished the 2005–06 season with 11 goals in 27 games, meaning he was Tottenham's second highest goalscorer. Tottenham confirmed in May 2006 that Mido would be returning to Roma.|$|E
5|$|Tottenham agreed a £6million fee with Birmingham City for Mido on 20 July 2007. Birmingham manager Steve Bruce {{said the}} move was close to collapsing, as the deal {{reportedly}} faltered over the wages {{and the length of}} contract Mido was demanding. The deal eventually fell through over a clause that Mido insisted be in the contract. In August 2007 Sunderland made a £6million bid for him and held talks, after which Birmingham confirmed they were trying to revive their deal to sign Mido. Middlesbrough then revealed their interest in signing him, matching the £6million fee of Birmingham and Sunderland and were given permission to speak to him. They eventually signed Mido for a fee of £6million on a four-year contract on 16 August 2007. He scored on his debut for Middlesbrough against Fulham and on his home debut against Newcastle United. During the Newcastle game, Mido was reportedly subject to Islamophobic <b>abuse</b> <b>from</b> some Newcastle supporters, which The Football Association (The FA) was to investigate.|$|E
