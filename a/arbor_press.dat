5|$|Vertical {{broaching}} machines {{can be designed}} for push broaching, pull-down broaching, pull-up broaching, or surface broaching. Push {{broaching machines}} are similar to an <b>arbor</b> <b>press</b> with a guided ram; typical capacities are 5 to 50 tons. The two ram pull-down machine {{is the most common}} type of broaching machine. This style machine has the rams under the table. Pull-up machines have the ram above the table; they usually have more than one ram. Most surface broaching is done on a vertical machine.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} making the large open end (bell) of a brass {{instrument}} is called metal beating. In making the bell of, for example, a trumpet, a person lays out a pattern and shapes sheet metal into a bell-shape using templates, machine tools, handtools, and blueprints. The maker cuts out the bell blank, using hand or power shears. He hammers the blank over a bell-shaped mandrel, and butts the seam, using a notching tool. The seam is brazed, using a torch and smoothed using a hammer or file. A draw bench or <b>arbor</b> <b>press</b> equipped with expandable lead plug is used to shape and smooth the bell and bell neck over a mandrel. A lathe is used to spin the bell head and to form a bead {{at the edge of}} bell head. Previously shaped bell necks are annealed, using a hand torch to soften the metal for further bending. Scratches are removed from the bell using abrasive-coated cloth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Arbor</b> <b>presses</b> can {{be mounted}} on a work bench, wall, or pedestal. The base is usually {{constructed}} of cast metal. A ram provides the force; it may be square or round. The ram is usually driven by a rack and pinion setup, to improve the mechanical advantage. Higher force <b>arbor</b> <b>presses</b> have another gear reduction. Forces are usually generated by manual or hydraulic input.|$|R

2500|$|Horace Greely Prettyman (November 8, 1857 – March 27, 1945) was an American {{football}} {{player in the}} early years of the sport. [...] Prettyman won a record eight varsity letters at the University of Michigan, playing for the school's football team from 1882 to 1886 and 1888 to 1890. [...] He was the team's captain in 1884, 1885, and 1886, and scored the first touchdown in the first game played at Michigan's first home football field in Ann Arbor. [...] Prettyman later became a successful businessman and civic leader, operating a boarding house, a laundry service, a power company and the Ann <b>Arbor</b> <b>Press,</b> and holding office as an Ann Arbor city councilman, postmaster and Washtenaw County, Michigan supervisor.|$|E

2500|$|Prettyman married Jennie McNames in June 1887, {{and the two}} {{operated}} a boarding house at 602 Lawrence Street in Ann Arbor that {{was known as the}} Campus Club, also known as Prettyman's Boarding House. [...] Mr. and Mrs. Prettyman charged $1.50 per week for a room and $2.50 per week for board. [...] Prettyman {{was a member of the}} Ann Arbor City Council from 1891 to 1895, president of the Ann Arbor Municipal League from 1892 to 1894, and a Washtenaw County supervisor starting in 1901. [...] Prettyman sold his boarding house to the University in 1914 and later became the principal owner and president of the Ann <b>Arbor</b> <b>Press</b> and the president of the White Swan Laundry and the Wolverine Power Company. [...] He was also Ann Arbor's postmaster for a time starting in 1906. [...] Prettyman died in March 1945 at age 87 at St. Joseph's Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} some {{specialty}} dies worth mentioning. [...] Bump dies are designed to move the shoulder of a bottleneck case back just a bit to facilitate chambering. [...] These are frequently {{used in conjunction with}} neck dies, as the bump die itself does not manipulate the neck of the case whatsoever. A bump die can be a very useful tool to anyone who owns a fine shooting rifle with a chamber that is cut to minimum headspace dimensions, as the die allows the case to be fitted to this unique chamber. Another die is the [...] "hand die". [...] A hand die has no threads and is operated—as the name suggests—by hand or by use of a hand-operated <b>arbor</b> <b>press.</b> [...] Hand dies are available for most popular cartridges, and although available as full-length resizing dies, they are most commonly seen as neck sizing dies. [...] These use an interchangeable insert to size the neck, and these inserts come in 1/1000-inch steps so that the user can custom fit the neck of the case to his own chamber or have greater control over neck tension on the bullet.|$|E
50|$|Press fit inserts are {{internally}} threaded {{and have}} a knurled outer diameter. They are pressed into a plain hole with an <b>arbor</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E
50|$|Press fit is {{achieved}} with presses that can press the parts together with very {{large amounts of}} force. The presses are generally hydraulic, although small hand-operated <b>presses</b> (such as <b>arbor</b> <b>presses)</b> may operate {{by means of the}} mechanical advantage supplied by a jackscrew or by a gear reduction driving a rack and pinion. The amount of force applied in hydraulic presses may be anything from a few pounds for the tiniest parts to hundreds of tons for the largest parts.|$|R

50|$|An <b>arbor</b> <b>press</b> is a {{small hand}} {{operated}} press. It is typically used to perform smaller jobs, such as staking, riveting, installing, configuring and removing bearings and other press fit work. Punches, inserters, or other tools/dies may {{be added to the}} end of the ram depending on the desired task. Arbor presses are usually rated by the maximum load they can apply. Typically common are presses with a leverage of 1-5 tons. This leverage is achieved when a force is applied to the lever arm or wheel.|$|E
50|$|Broaching is {{primarily}} used to cut square cornered internal keyways. The specific broach, bushing and guide {{are used for}} each given keyway cross-section, which makes this process more expensive {{than most of the}} alternatives. However, it can produce the most accurate keyway out of all the processes. There are three main steps in broaching a keyway: First, the workpiece is set on the <b>arbor</b> <b>press</b> and the bushing is placed in the opening of the workpiece. Next, the broach is inserted and pushed through, cutting the keyway. Finally, shims are placed between the bushing and the broach to achieve the correct depth necessary for the key.|$|E
50|$|The {{second type}} of captive nut is a {{threaded}} insert. These are either pressed into holes in the material to be joined or moulded in. In either case, part of the insert is generally knurled {{to get a good}} grip on the material supporting the insert. One variant, the swage nut, has a knurled portion that swages the sides of a soft metal hole to more tightly grip the nut. Press fit and swaged captive nuts are used in panels that are too thin to be threaded or in soft materials that are too weak to be threaded. They are installed by pressing them in with an <b>arbor</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E
