50|$|The TC1100 has a 10.4 inch LCD {{display and}} {{pressure-sensitive}} pen that shares {{the same basic}} design as its predecessor, the TC1000. It has a design {{often referred to as}} a hybrid tablet, as it has the properties of both a convertible and slate tablet. All the necessary hardware components are stored within the casing of the display and digitizer. This allows it to work with or without a keyboard attached. With the keyboard attached, it {{can be used as a}} laptop, with the display rising by an <b>adjustable</b> <b>hinge</b> behind the keyboard. By rotating the display, the keyboard can fold inside the unit; or the keyboard can be removed entirely. Either method lets the user write on the screen easily, using a virtual keyboard or handwriting-recognition application for occasional character entry. This versatility gave the product a loyal following when there were no similar designs on the market.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although oral {{appliances}} {{are effective}} in some patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), they are not universally effective. A novel anterior mandibular positioner (AMP) has been developed with an <b>adjustable</b> <b>hinge</b> that allows progressive advancement of the mandible. The objective of this prospective crossover study was to compare efficacy, side effects, patient compliance, and preference between AMP and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) in patients with symptomatic mild to moderate OSA. METHODS: Twenty four patients of mean (SD) age 44. 0 (10. 6) years were recruited with a mean (SD) body mass index of 32. 0 (8. 2) kg/m 2, Epworth sleepiness score 10. 7 (3. 4), and apnoea/hypopnoea index 26. 8 (11. 9) /hour. There was a two week wash-in and a two week wash-out period and two treatment periods (AMP and nCPAP) each of four months. Efficacy, side effects, compliance, and preference were evaluated by a questionnaire and home sleep monitoring. RESULTS: One patient dropped out early {{in the study and}} three refused to cross over so treatment results are presented on the remaining 20 patients. The apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) was lower with nasal CPAP 4. 2 (2. 2) /hour than with the AMP 13. 6 (14. 5) /hour (p < 0. 01). Eleven of the 20 patients (55 %) who used the AMP were treatment successes (reduction of AHI to < 10 /hour and relief of symptoms), one (5 %) was a compliance failure (unable or unwilling to use the treatment), and eight (40 %) were treatment failures (failure to reduce AHI to < 10 /hour and/or failure to relieve symptoms). Fourteen of the 20 patients (70 %) who used nCPAP were treatment successes, six (30 %) were compliance failures, and there were no treatment failures. There was greater patient satisfaction with the AMP (p < 0. 01) than with nCPAP but no difference in reported side effects or compliance. CONCLUSIONS: AMP is an effective treatment in some patients with mild to moderate OSA and is associated with greater patient satisfaction than nCPAP. ...|$|E
50|$|Messenger bags {{typically}} incorporate {{features that}} make them particularly suitable for cycling, such as fittings that {{make it easy to}} adjust the shoulder strap, quick release buckles, an <b>adjustable</b> <b>hinged</b> buckle, and the ability to attach a variety of accessories, such as lights, phone holsters, or U-locks. Contemporary stabilizing straps help to prevent the bag from shifting while riding. The top-opening one-strap design allows messenger bags to be easily swung around front so that their contents can be accessed without having to remove the bag.|$|R
40|$|Radial head {{dislocation}} {{associated with}} plastic bowing of the ulna {{is classified as}} a Monteggia equivalent lesion. This injury in children can be treated by closed reduction, but manipulative reduction may not completely correct plastic bowing of the ulna. We encountered two cases of incomplete reduction in which the radial head was reduced in a supination position, but redislocated during rotation from neutral to a pronation position. The patients were treated conservatively using an <b>adjustable</b> <b>hinged</b> elbow splint. Plain radiography at 6 weeks after incomplete closed reduction showed that the radial head was reduced in all positions from supination to pronation; thus, both patients had good outcomes. Our method is non-invasive and may be an option for treatment of incomplete reduction of radial head dislocation with acute plastic bowing of the ulna...|$|R
5000|$|Most modern {{binoculars}} {{are also}} <b>adjustable</b> via a <b>hinged</b> construction {{that enables the}} distance between the two telescope halves to be adjusted to accommodate viewers with different eye separation or [...] "interpupillary distance". Most are optimized for the interpupillary distance (typically 56 mm) for adults.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was built}} with a Watson cab with a slanted front to allow {{easy access to}} the firebox cladding which covered the flexible firebox stays and stay caps. The cab was 9 ft wide and was fitted with <b>hinged</b> <b>adjustable</b> glass windscreens for the lookout and a rigid extended footplate instead of the older fall plate. The cab footsteps were attached to the rigid platform.|$|R
50|$|The cab {{arrangement}} was made especially convenient for the crew. The double roof {{was lined with}} teak while side louvre ventilators with roller slides were fitted. The cab front and sides had ventilating doors. Sliding louvres in the cab sides provided adequate weather protection while the lookout had <b>hinged</b> <b>adjustable</b> glass windscreens. The cab was completely enclosed with sliding side doors and the crew had upholstered hinged seats with armrests.|$|R

50|$|Stock: H-S Precision PST-024, {{the model}} with the fixed cheek piece, <b>adjustable</b> LOP and <b>hinged</b> floorplate. The stock secures the action via an {{aluminum}} bedding block {{to keep it}} rigid. The barrel is free floating. A twin-strut extension that pulls out of the butt allows a 2-inch 50.8mm adjustment to length-of-pull, as well as allowing for the weapon to fit inside the M-1950 Weapon Container for Airborne Operations. This is effected by a thick wheel on a central grooved pillar for adjusting the length and a thin locking ring behind it locks the thick wheel in place. The stock is primarily made from a polymer foam reinforced with fiberglass, carbon fiber, and Kevlar to reduce weight and then painted with a heavy duty polane paint. They were rigorously tested before being approved by Remington and the military.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of existing elemental base for design of hydraulic and pneumatic drives was done. Architecture {{and structure of}} elemental bases was studied {{and their impact on}} the functional abilities of hydraulic and pneumatic drive systems were determined. In this study a fundamentally new element base of hydraulic and pneumatic drive systems that include complex hydraulic and pneumatic drives aggregated with micromovement system, elastically-deformed drives, hydrostatic and aerostatic <b>hinges,</b> including <b>adjustable</b> and magnetic <b>hinges</b> and inertial fluctuations dampers was developed. In the proposed element base we used new materials and technologies: ceramics, photo polymers, metalpolymer and ferromagnetic composites. Computer integrated Manufacturing Engineering, including laser processing were applied. The workflows in the innovative drives elements, including characteristics of flow in gaps of a hinges, ferromagnetic fluid flowing and processes in pneumatic devices were researched. The dynamic properties of the developed drive systems were investigated. The inertia characteristics of a drives were described using stochastic tensor fields of the moments of inertia with introducing tensor-gradient of a field. The planar and spatial linear and nonlinear dynamic models were used. The mathematical models for calculating the dynamic chain partial spherical motion subsystems were developed and the features of their dynamic characteristics were established. The main results of research were tested by manufacturing of drive systems, built on new element base. ???????? ?????? ????????? ?????????? ??? ?????????????? ?????? ?????- ? ??????????????. ??????????? ??????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ??? ? ?????????? ?? ??????? ?? ???????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????????????? ?????? ?????- ? ??????????????. ??????????? ????????????? ????? ?????????? ???? ?????? ?????- ? ??????????????, ?????????? ??????????? ?????- ? ????????????? ?????????????? ? ????????? ????????????????, ??????-??????????????? ???????, ???????????????? ? ??????????????? ???????, ? ??? ????? ???????????? ? ????????? ???????. ?????????? ????????????? ????? ????????? ??????????? ???????, ? ??? ????? ??????? ? ?????????????? ????????? ? ???????? ???????? ????. ??? ????????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????? ?????????, ? ??? ????? ??????????? ???????? ? ?????????????? ?????????. ? ????????? ????????? ????????? ????? ????????? ? ??????????: ????????, ????????????, ?????????????? ??????????????? ?????????, ?????? ?????????? ???????

40|$|OAKO (Orthosis after {{knee joint}} operation) team {{accepted}} {{the challenge of}} helping MDH Company to make a project that consists of creating a new orthosis after knee-joint operation. The company {{will be able to}} open their own production line of this product in the future when the orthosis is complete. The main challenge for OAKO was to find a new global design by doing this project in an innovative way. After some research, the team found out that most of the orthosis after knee-joint operation have problems with the ergonomics and are mainly designed with Velcro attaching systems, which is experienced as a negative aspect of the product. In order to improve the product, the team has put a lot of effort on finding a way to eliminate the Velcro and succeeded by finding a different way to attach the product via magnets and basic belts. Furthermore, as “being innovative’’ was the main guideline, the team found innovative fabrics with skin care (3 D fabric and polyamide textile adapted for sport activity instead of unbreathable material) and designed an ergonomic shape which is completely innovative in the world of orthosis. After brainstorming, meeting with specialist, research and questionnaire results explanation, the team understood that {{the most important part of}} the orthosis is the joint of the frame (<b>adjustable</b> locking <b>hinge),</b> that is the reason why the team think about using silicon pads on this parts, which will help to reduce the pressure problems and deliver a better user experience. Also this option is totally universal as it embraces the knee form. The OAKO orthosis after knee-joint is not ready to be out on the market right now as the product is still in the prototype stage. Moreover, MDH already has a selection of fabrics, plus the exact shape due to 2 D modeling. Also, MDH now has knowledge about attaching the product through magnet locks though bands which enable to replace the Velcro and they are aware that using silicon pads in the knee joint area is definitely a good idea. All this is thanks to OAKO team’s research and product development. The prototype uses materials from a Polish company (fabrics from Lodz) and German buckles. OAKO hopes that for future those companies will collaborate together in order to keep the quality of the prototype. Nowadays, the cost of production per product is around 60 €. Finally, as the hypothesis says, everything depends on the global amount of charges of MDH, if the MDH charge can be cut down by two times the cost of production. The OAKO orthosis after knee-joint operation will be around 40 € per unit...|$|R
