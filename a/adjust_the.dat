30|$|The above {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} the PP between the terminal points can be controlled by <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> voltage amplitude and phase angle of each terminal. In addition, the active and reactive power can be decoupled. Ideally, the value of PP should be controlled at zero to guarantee the maximum transmission power. The active PP can be controlled by arranging the amount of reactive power compensation at the terminal point properly. This contributes to <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> voltage amplitude. As for the reactive PP, the phase angle can be controlled by <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> unit operation mode at the adjacent areas of terminal points.|$|R

In 1938, after the expiration of the minimum 25-year period during which the design could not be replaced without congressional authorization, it was replaced by the Jefferson nickel, designed by Felix Schlag. Fraser's design is admired today, and has been used on commemorative coins and the gold American Buffalo series.|$|E

5|$|It {{can also}} be seen however that this simple 2-dimensional model, {{essentially}} an inverted pendulum on a turntable, predicts that the steady-state turn is unstable. If the bike is displaced slightly downwards from its equilibrium lean angle, the torque of gravity increases, that of centrifugal force decreases and the displacement gets amplified. A more-sophisticated model that allows a wheel to steer, <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> path, and counter the torque of gravity, is necessary to capture the self-stability observed in real bikes.|$|E

Other offline modes include Versus Mode, where two players can fight against each other locally; Training Mode, which features several customization options for training purposes, {{such as the ability}} to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> Hyper Combo gauge, set AI difficulty, record and playback moves, and even simulate input lag; and Mission Mode, which features character-specific challenges designed to test players on their ability to execute complex combos.|$|E
