50|$|As {{research}} on the mental lexicon continues to expand into our modern world of abbreviations, researchers have begun to question whether the mental lexicon {{has the capacity to}} store <b>acronyms</b> as well as words. Using a lexical decision task with <b>acronyms</b> as priming words, researchers saw that <b>acronyms</b> could in fact prime other related information. This finding suggests that <b>acronyms</b> are stored alongside their related information in the mental lexicon just as a word would be. Research also demonstrated that these <b>acronyms</b> would still prime related information despite inaccurate capitalization (i.e. bbc had the same priming effects as BBC).|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>acronyms</b> like BBC are processed like real words. This claim has been based on improved performance with <b>acronyms</b> in the Reicher-Wheeler task, the letter string matching task, the visual feature integration task, and the N 400 component in event-related potential (ERP) studies. Unfortunately, in all these tasks performance on <b>acronyms</b> resembled performance on pseudowords more than performance on words. To further assess the similarity of <b>acronyms</b> and words, we focused on the meaning of the <b>acronyms</b> and used masked priming to examine whether target words can be primed to the same extent with associatively related <b>acronyms</b> as with associatively related words. Such priming was possible at a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 84 ms. In addition, the priming of the <b>acronyms</b> did not depend on the letter case in which they were presented: The target word books was primed as much by isbn and iSbN as by ISBN...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the various types of {{syntactic}} roles played by Spanish and English <b>acronyms.</b> These roles include those which derive from the original grammatical function of the <b>acronyms</b> and also those adopted as a result of the semantic transformations the <b>acronyms</b> may undergo in the course of time. After emphasizing the nominal value usually attached to <b>acronyms,</b> the paper examines other secondary grammatical categories which are obtained primarily by way of the functional shift. The essay also tries to define the linguistic status, the relative frequency and the contexts in which the different types of <b>acronyms</b> occur. Finally the author points out the great plasticity of English <b>acronyms,</b> especially those which are frequently used in ordinary language or in the technical speech of certain jargons...|$|R

It is a general rule of abstracting at the NASA Center For Aerospace Information (CASI) that <b>acronyms</b> are expanded in the abstract to enhance both information content and searchability. Over the last 22 years, abstracters at CASI have recorded <b>acronyms</b> and their expansions as they were encountered in documents.

5|$|The United States Coast Guard (USCG) Women's Reserve, {{better known}} by the <b>acronym</b> SPARS, was the World War II women's branch of the USCG Reserve. It was {{established}} by the U.S. Congress and {{signed into law by}} the President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 23 November 1942. This authorized the acceptance of women into the reserve as commissioned officers and at the enlisted level, effective {{for the duration of the}} war plus six months. The purpose of the law was to release officers and men for sea duty and to replace them with women at shore stations. Dorothy C. Stratton was appointed director of the Women's Reserve (SPARS), with the rank of lieutenant commander and was later promoted to captain. She had been the Dean of Women on leave from Purdue University, and an officer in The United States Naval Reserve (Women's Reserve), better known under the <b>acronym</b> WAVES for Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service. Stratton is credited with creating the nautical name of SPARS.|$|E

Power passed to five politicians known collectively by a whimsical <b>acronym</b> as the Cabal—Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley (afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury) and Lauderdale. In fact, the Cabal rarely acted in concert, and the court was often divided between two factions led by Arlington and Buckingham, with Arlington the more successful.|$|E
5|$|In {{a number}} of older books, the MiG I-211 is called the MiG-5.

Similarly, the MiG-9 designation was intended for the production version of the MiG-3 with the ASh-82 radial engine.
