25|$|The smartwatch {{comes with}} a Gorilla Glass 64-color e-paper <b>always-on</b> display {{developed}} by JDI with 144x168 resolution and has a pixel density of 182ppi. This is the first Pebble smartwatch to have a color display, and still retains a LED backlight as well. The watch also has a vibrating motor for silent alarms, and smart notifications. The watch {{comes with a}} redesigned charging cable that, like its predecessor's cable, magnetically attaches itself to the watch {{in order to maintain}} its water resistance. Unlike its predecessor, the cable attaches {{to the back of the}} watch rather than the side, and has the potential to transfer data rather than just power. The band attaches with standard 22mm pins. The watch is also equipped with an ambient light sensor and 6 axis accelerometer.|$|E
25|$|Internet {{telephony}} {{is another}} common communications service {{made possible by}} the creation of the Internet. VoIP stands for Voice-over-Internet Protocol, referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with walkie-talkie-like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with <b>always-on</b> Internet connections such as cable or ADSL. VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.|$|E

Cortana's <b>always-on</b> voice detection {{was considered to be}} its [...] "true strength", also citing its query capabilities and personalization features, but noting that it was not as pre-emptive as Google Now. Windows10's stock applications were praised for being improved over their Windows 8 counterparts, and for supporting windowed modes. The Xbox app was also praised for its Xbox One streaming functionality, although recommending its use over a wired network due to inconsistent quality over Wi-Fi. In conclusion, it was argued that [...] "Windows10 delivers the most refined desktop experience ever from Microsoft, and yet it's so much more than that. It's also a decent tablet OS, and it's ready for a world filled with hybrid devices. And, barring another baffling screwup, it looks like a significant step forward for mobile. Heck, it makes the Xbox One a more useful machine." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 12, 2017, Burger King {{released}} a commercial entitled Connected Whopper, {{in which a}} store employee says that while he could not explain a Whopper in 15 seconds, he had discovered {{a different way to}} do so, after which he states [...] "OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?". The dialogue was designed to trigger voice searches on Android devices and Google Home smart speakers configured to automatically respond to the phrase [...] "OK Google". [...] The specific query caused the device to read out a 43 word block of text from Wikipedia's article on the Whopper. Prior to the ad's premiere, the article had been edited by users, including one named [...] "Burger King Corporation", so that Google's automatically generated response to the query would be {{a detailed description of the}} Whopper burger in promotional language. The edits were reverted for violating Wikipedia's policy against promotion. Soon after the text became the target of vandals, Google blacklisted the advertisement's audio so that it would not trigger the <b>always-on</b> voice detection. In turn, Burger King modified the commercial in order to get around this block. Wikipedia also protected the Whopper article to prevent the promotional descriptions or vandalism from being re-inserted. Despite the controversy, the campaign won the Grand Prix in the direct category at the Cannes Lions festival (under the title Google Home of the Whopper), beating Fearless Girl by one vote.|$|E
2500|$|Digital rights {{management}} (DRM) {{is a type}} {{of technology}} that is intended to control the use of digital content and devices after purchase. [...] Many companies make use of DRM to prevent copyright infringement and to protect an entity's intellectual property from public access. [...] Opponents of DRM argue that it only inconveniences legitimate customers and allows big business to stifle innovation and competition. In the US, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 increased the strength of DRM. Objection to DRM caused Microsoft to change its DRM policy for Xbox One. <b>Always-on</b> digital rights management (DRM), also known as persistent online authentication, {{is a type of}} controversial technology relating to video games. This technology requires a consumer to maintain a connection to a host server in order to use a particular product or play a game. Those against <b>Always-on</b> DRM focus on server connection difficulties, single player offline preferences, and game playability once companies shut down a server.|$|E

A teaser trailer of the multiplayer mode was released on the official site before the E3. A cinematic debut trailer was diffused during Ubisoft's E3 2010 press conference along a walkthrough of the game's beginning. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood reached gold status on October 28, 2010.

2500|$|The channel's {{original}} format was akin {{to that of}} a {{news and}} information cable network. Since the creation of the series Atmospheres in 2000 and Storm Stories in 2003, The Weather Channel had seen a gradual transition toward a mix of weather forecast programming and weather-related entertainment programming that paralleled the launch of sister network Weatherscan, the evolution of the <b>always-on</b> [...] "L" [...] bar/weather ticker, the development of weather.com and popular branded mobile phone applications, and the increased viewing and interest in documentary programs on the topic of weather. In November 2013, the channel introduced a new initiative of [...] "weather all the time" [...] in response to the criticism; all original programming – which was rebranded under the tagline Natural Drama – now had direct relevance to weather-related subjects, and the network reemphasized its promise to interrupt original programming either regionally or nationally during major weather events; in addition, The Weather Channel extended the display of its lower display line (which also experienced a design revamp as part of the introduction of a new graphics package) to commercial breaks and through entire broadcasts of its original programs.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of {{the term}} claim that [...] "Web 2.0" [...] does not {{represent}} {{a new version of}} the World Wide Web at all, but merely continues to use so-called [...] "Web 1.0" [...] technologies and concepts. First, techniques such as Ajax do not replace underlying protocols like HTTP, but add an additional layer of abstraction on top of them. Second, many of the ideas of Web 2.0 were already featured in implementations on networked systems well before the term [...] "Web 2.0" [...] emerged. Amazon.com, for instance, has allowed users to write reviews and consumer guides since its launch in 1995, in a form of self-publishing. Amazon also opened its API to outside developers in 2002. Previous developments also came from research in computer-supported collaborative learning and computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) and from established products like Lotus Notes and Lotus Domino, all phenomena that preceded Web 2.0. Tim Berners-Lee, who developed the initial technologies of the Web, has been an outspoken critic {{of the term}}, while supporting many of the elements associated with it. In the environment where the Web originated, each workstation had a dedicated IP address and <b>always-on</b> connection to the Internet. Sharing a file or publishing a web page was as simple as moving the file into a shared folder.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} the Internet in India started with launch of {{services}} by VSNL on 15 August 1995. They were able to add about 10,000 Internet users within 6 months. However, for the next 10 years the Internet experience in the country remained less attractive with narrow-band connections having speeds less than 56 kbit/s (dial-up). In 2004, the government formulated its broadband policy which defined broadband as [...] "an <b>always-on</b> Internet connection with download speed of 256 kbit/s or above." [...] From 2005 onward {{the growth of the}} broadband sector in the country accelerated, but remained below the growth estimates of the government and related agencies due to resource issues in last-mile access which were predominantly wired-line technologies. This bottleneck was removed in 2010 when the government auctioned 3G spectrum followed by an equally high-profile auction of 4G spectrum that set the scene for a competitive and invigorated wireless broadband market. Now Internet access in India is provided by both public and private companies using a variety of technologies and media including dial-up (PSTN), xDSL, coaxial cable, Ethernet, FTTH, ISDN, HSDPA (3G), WiFi, WiMAX, etc. at a wide range of speeds and costs. As per IAMAI India will have the world's second largest number of Internet users with over 300 million by December 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to Xbox One's launch, privacy {{concerns}} were raised {{over the new}} Kinect; critics showed concerns the device {{could be used for}} surveillance, stemming from the originally announced requirements that Xbox One's Kinect be plugged in at all times, plus the initial <b>always-on</b> DRM system that required the console to be connected to the internet to ensure continued functionality. Privacy advocates contended that the increased amount of data which could be collected with the new Kinect (such as a person's eye movements, heart rate, and mood) could be used for targeted advertising. Reports also surfaced regarding recent Microsoft patents involving Kinect, such as a DRM system based on detecting the number of viewers in a room, and tracking viewing habits by awarding achievements for watching television programs and advertising. While Microsoft stated that its privacy policy [...] "prohibit the collection, storage, or use of Kinect data for the purpose of advertising", critics did not {{rule out the possibility that}} these policies could be changed prior to the release of the console. Concerns were also raised that the device could also record conversations, as its microphone remains active at all times. In response to the criticism, a Microsoft spokesperson stated that users are [...] "in control of when Kinect sensing is On, Off or Paused", will be provided with key privacy information and settings during the console's initial setup, and that user-generated content such as photos and videos [...] "will not leave your Xbox One without your explicit permission." [...] Microsoft ultimately decided to reverse its decision to require Kinect usage on Xbox One, but the console still shipped with the device upon its launch in November 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Proponents {{of nuclear}} energy argue that nuclear power is a clean and {{sustainable}} energy source which provides huge amounts of uninterrupted energy without polluting the air or emitting the carbon emissions that cause Global warming. Use of nuclear power provides plentiful, well-paying jobs, energy security, reduces a dependence on imported fuels and exposure to price risks associated with resource speculation and Middle East politics. Proponents advance the notion that nuclear power produces virtually no air pollution, {{in contrast to the}} massive amount of pollution and carbon emission generated from burning Fossil fuel like coal, oil and natural gas. Modern society demands <b>always-on</b> energy to power communications, computer networks, transportation, industry and residences at all times of day and night. In the absence of nuclear power, utilities need to burn fossil fuels to keep the energy grid reliable, even with access to solar and wind energy, because those sources are intermittent. [...] Proponents also believe that nuclear power is the only viable course for a country to achieve energy independence while also meeting their [...] "ambitious" [...] NDC's (nationally determined contributions) to reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement signed by 195 nations. They emphasize that the risks of storing waste are small and existing stockpiles can be reduced by using this waste to produce fuels for the latest technology in newer reactors. Finally, even though alarmist media reports of nuclear accidents raised fear levels a lot, in fact the Chernobyl disaster caused 56 direct deaths and Fukushima reactors caused no actual deaths {{as a result of the}} nuclear meltdown. The operational safety record of nuclear is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants and by preventing pollution, actually saves lives every year.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>always-on</b> {{requirement}} {{was quietly}} lifted for existing Uplay games {{towards the end}} of 2010, being changed to a single validation on game launch. [...] However, the <b>always-on</b> requirement made a return in 2011 with the releases of Driver: San Francisco and From Dust, the latter having been explicitly stated by Ubisoft prior to release to only require a one-time online activation on install. From Dust was later patched to remove the <b>always-on</b> requirement.|$|E

5000|$|Popular {{video games}} such as Diablo III and Starcraft 2 employ <b>always-on</b> DRM by {{requiring}} players {{to connect to}} the internet to play, even in single-player mode. Reviews of Diablo III criticized its use of <b>always-on</b> DRM. As with Diablo III, SimCity (2013) experienced bugs at its launch due to <b>always-on</b> DRM. Its developer, Maxis, initially defended the practice as being {{a result of the}} game's reliance on cloud computing for in-game processing, but it was later confirmed that cloud computing was only necessary to support the inter-city and social media mechanisms. [...] Tim Willits at id Software has also defended the use of <b>always-on</b> DRM, arguing that it would make updates easier. This later received even more criticism, with users stating that these updates could potentially render the game unable to be played.|$|E
