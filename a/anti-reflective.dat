5|$|The {{wings are}} {{transparent}} with black or brown veins and a brown-black patch {{at the base}} of apical cells 2 and 3. These patches are sometimes fused into a continuous zigzag of dark brown to black discolouration. The basal cell is often opaque and amber-coloured. As on many insects, the wing membranes are coated on either side by a repeating pattern of cuticular nanostructures, about 200nm in height, separated by about 180nm. These are thought to aid in <b>anti-reflective</b> camouflage, anti-wetting and self-cleaning.|$|E
25|$|Surface treatments, {{coatings}} or lamination {{may follow}} {{to improve the}} chemical durability (glass container coatings, glass container internal treatment), strength (toughened glass, bulletproof glass, windshields), or optical properties (insulated glazing, <b>anti-reflective</b> coating).|$|E
25|$|<b>Anti-reflective</b> {{coatings}} {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of applications where light passes through an optical surface, and low loss or low reflection is desired. Examples include anti-glare coatings on corrective lenses and camera lens elements, and antireflective coatings on solar cells.|$|E
25|$|Anti-glare {{protection}} glasses, or <b>anti-reflective</b> glasses, {{can reduce}} the reflection of light that enters our eyes. The lenses are given an anti-glare coating to prevent reflections of light under different lighting conditions. By {{reducing the amount of}} glare on your eyes, vision can be improved. The anti-glare also applies to the outer glass, thus allowing for better eye contact.|$|E
25|$|Fw 190 A-5/U2 — The A-5/U2 was {{designed}} as a night Jabo-Rei and featured <b>anti-reflective</b> fittings and exhaust flame dampers. A centre-line ETC 501 rack typically held a 250kg (550lb) bomb, and wing-mounted racks mounted 300L drop tanks. A EK16 gun camera, as well as landing lights, were fitted to the wing leading edge. The U2 was armed with only two 20mm MG 151 cannon.|$|E
25|$|The main {{benefits}} to PEM coatings are {{the ability to}} conformably coat objects (that is, the technique {{is not limited to}} coating flat objects), the environmental benefits of using water-based processes, reasonable costs, and the utilization of the particular chemical properties of the film for further modification, such as the synthesis of metal or semiconductor nanoparticles, or porosity phase transitions to create <b>anti-reflective</b> coatings, optical shutters, and superhydrophobic coatings.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, this problem, {{which is}} {{particularly}} nettlesome for GaAs-based lasers emitting between 0.630µm and 1µm wavelengths (less so for InP-based lasers used for long-haul telecommunications which emit between 1.3µm and 2µm), was identified. Michael Ettenberg, a researcher and later Vice President at RCA Laboratories' David Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, New Jersey, devised a solution. A {{thin layer of}} aluminum oxide was deposited on the facet. If the aluminum oxide thickness is chosen correctly, it functions as an <b>anti-reflective</b> coating, reducing reflection at the surface. This alleviated the heating and COD at the facet.|$|E
25|$|Moths' {{eyes have}} an unusual property: their {{surfaces}} {{are covered with}} a natural nanostructured film, which eliminates reflections. This allows the moth to see well in the dark, without reflections to give its location away to predators. The structure consists of a hexagonal pattern of bumps, each roughly 200nm high and spaced on 300nm centers. This kind of antireflective coating works because the bumps are smaller than the wavelength of visible light, so the light sees the surface as having a continuous refractive index gradient between {{the air and the}} medium, which decreases reflection by effectively removing the air-lens interface. Practical <b>anti-reflective</b> films have been made by humans using this effect; this is a form of biomimicry.|$|E
25|$|Semiconductor optical {{amplifiers}} (SOAs) are amplifiers {{which use}} a semiconductor {{to provide the}} gain medium. These amplifiers have a similar structure to Fabry–Pérot laser diodes but with anti-reflection design elements at the end faces. Recent designs include <b>anti-reflective</b> coatings and tilted wave guide and window regions which can reduce end face reflection to less than 0.001%. Since this creates a loss of power from the cavity which {{is greater than the}} gain, it prevents the amplifier from acting as a laser. Another type of SOA consists of two regions. One part has a structure of a Fabry-Pérot laser diode and the other has a tapered geometry {{in order to reduce the}} power density on the output facet.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} many types of PV systems known to be effective, {{crystalline}} silicon PV accounted for around 90% of the worldwide production of PV in 2013. Manufacturing silicon PV systems has several steps. First, polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of Boron, a group III element, are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes. Typically using a seed crystal, an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a group V element, which creates an N-type semiconducting surface. To reduce energy losses an <b>anti-reflective</b> coating {{is added to the}} surface, along with electrical contacts. After finishing the cell, cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation.|$|E
25|$|For {{the past}} years, {{researchers}} {{have been trying to}} reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. Thin-film solar cell is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants. Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques. Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the OPTOS formalism. In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si. In combination with <b>anti-reflective</b> coating, surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of light rays.|$|E

2500|$|The {{simplest}} interference <b>anti-reflective</b> coating {{consists of}} a single thin layer of transparent material with refractive index equal to the square root of the substrate's refractive index. In air, such a coating theoretically gives zero reflectance for light with wavelength (in the coating) equal to four times the coating's thickness. Reflectance is also decreased for wavelengths in a broad band around the center. A layer of thickness equal to a quarter of some design wavelength is called a [...] "quarter-wave layer".|$|E

2500|$|To reduce optical {{visibility}} {{during daylight}} flights, the B-2 is painted in an <b>anti-reflective</b> paint. The undersides are dark because it flies at high altitudes (...) , {{and at that}} altitude a dark grey painting blends well into the sky. It is speculated to have an upward-facing light sensor which alerts the pilot to increase or reduce altitude to match the changing illuminance of the sky. The original design had tanks for a contrail-inhibiting chemical, but this was replaced in production aircraft by a contrail sensor that alerts the crew when they should change altitude. The B-2 is vulnerable to visual interception at ranges of [...] or less.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} form of <b>anti-reflective</b> coating {{was discovered}} by Lord Rayleigh in 1886. The optical glass {{available at the time}} tended to develop a tarnish on its surface with age, due to chemical reactions with the environment. Rayleigh tested some old, slightly tarnished pieces of glass, and found to his surprise that they transmitted more light than new, clean pieces. The tarnish replaces the air-glass interface with two interfaces: an air-tarnish interface and a tarnish-glass interface. Because the tarnish has a refractive index between those of glass and air, each of these interfaces exhibits less reflection than the air-glass interface did. In fact, the total of the two reflections is less than that of the [...] "naked" [...] air-glass interface, as can be calculated from the Fresnel equations.|$|E
2500|$|Practical anti-reflection coatings, however, rely on an {{intermediate}} layer {{not only for}} its direct reduction of reflection coefficient, but also use the interference effect of a thin layer. Assume the layer's thickness is controlled precisely, such that it is exactly one quarter of the wavelength of light in the layer ( [...] , where λ0 is the vacuum wavelength). The layer is then called a quarter-wave coating. For this type of coating a normally incident beam I, when reflected from the second interface, will travel exactly half its own wavelength further than the beam reflected from the first surface, leading to destructive interference. This is also true for thicker coating layers (3λ/4, 5λ/4, etc.), however the <b>anti-reflective</b> performance is worse in this case due to the stronger dependence of the reflectance on wavelength and the angle of incidence.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1969 Elliot Berman joined Exxon's {{task force}} which {{was looking for}} {{projects}} 30 {{years in the future}} and in April 1973 he founded Solar Power Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon at that time. The group had concluded that electrical power would be much more expensive by 2000, and felt that this increase in price would make alternative energy sources more attractive. He conducted a market study and concluded that a price per watt of about $20/watt would create significant demand. The team eliminated the steps of polishing the wafers and coating them with an <b>anti-reflective</b> layer, relying on the rough-sawn wafer surface. The team also replaced the expensive materials and hand wiring used in space applications with a printed circuit board on the back, acrylic plastic on the front, and silicone glue between the two, [...] "potting" [...] the cells. Solar cells could be made using cast-off material from the electronics market. By 1973 they announced a product, and SPC convinced Tideland Signal to use its panels to power navigational buoys, initially for the U.S. Coast Guard.|$|E
5000|$|Handling - Some {{coatings}} {{are more}} durable than others. A scratch through an <b>anti-reflective</b> coating is also much more visible than a scratch {{through the surface}} of an uncoated glass due to {{the difference in the}} reflectivity of the scratched surface (glass ~8%) and the reflectivity of the <b>anti-reflective</b> surface around the scratch (~0.5%). Therefore, <b>anti-reflective</b> coatings with more scratch-resistance are preferred in art glazing. Magnetron-sputtered and sol-gel <b>anti-reflective</b> coatings are typically metal oxides with superior hardness compared to other application methods.|$|E
5000|$|Cleaning - since <b>anti-reflective</b> {{coatings}} {{render the}} glass surface virtually invisible, the dirt or soiling {{of the surface}} is much more visible on an <b>anti-reflective</b> surface.
