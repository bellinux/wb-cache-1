25|$|Spirits or ghosts {{were said}} to fly <b>along</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> direct course close to the ground, so a {{straight}} line connecting two places was kept clear of fences, walls, and buildings to avoid obstructing the flitting spectres. The paths would run {{in a straight line}} over mountains and valleys and through marshes. In towns, they would pass the houses closely or go right through them. The paths end or originate at a cemetery; therefore, such a path or road was believed to have the same characteristics as a cemetery, where spirits of the deceased thrive.|$|E

In Storybrooke, Regina, Mary Margaret and David discover the spell that would allow one of Merlin’s chosen to communicate with him, but they soon become suspicious of Arthur after he fails to reach the missing sorcerer, and when Emma commands Merida to kill Belle in hopes of forcing Mr. Gold’s heroic transformation, Gold must use his courage to fight for Belle’s life.|$|E
25|$|To {{land the}} cannon onto Tybee Island, {{artillery}} pieces were taken off transports, set on rafts at high tide, and pitched into the surf near shore. At low tide, manpower alone would drag the guns up the beach. Two {{hundred and fifty}} men were required to move a 13-inch mortar <b>along</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sling cart. Later Union amphibious operations would employ contraband labor {{for much of this}} work. Along the two-and-a-half mile front, their engineers had to construct almost a mile of corduroy road made of bundles of brushwood to keep the guns from sinking into the swamp. While offloading proceeded day and night according to the tides, Confederate bombardment from Fort Pulaski gunners required all Federal movement into the island limited to night time. After a month of work, 36 mortars, heavy guns and rifled cannon were in position.|$|E

500|$|So {{has been}} {{described}} as Gabriel's most commercially accessible and least experimental album. Like his previous albums, its basis is in art rock, although on So, Gabriel develops an increased focus on melody and combines this with elements of soul and African music. [...] "With a song like (the previous album's) 'The Rhythm of the Heat' or 'The Family and the Fishing Net', if I were to strum that <b>along</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> guitar or piano, the song might not work very well... whereas more of the things on this album do work just as lyric, melody and chords in a more traditional sense." ...|$|E

500|$|Kinman's {{brutality}} {{was noted}} by James R. Duff, a fellow '49er, who {{described him as}} [...] "an avowed enemy of the red man, ... (who) shot an Indian on sight."

500|$|Upon release, {{the song}} {{received}} mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the song a [...] "slice of vintage euro-pop perfection," [...] while John Murphy of musicOMH named it [...] "another poppy ballad which {{gets away with}} some cheesy lyrics by being touchingly sincere, making it probably the best track on the album." [...] Jennifer Nine of Yahoo! Music agreed, labeling it an [...] "airy, girlishly fresh album stand-out [...] soars lump-throatedly <b>along</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> peerlessly evocative Peter Hook bassline like some dreamy combination of Cyndi Lauper’s 'Time After Time' and Ms Ciccone’s 'True Blue'. Jason Damas of PopMatters claimed that the song [...] "takes us back closer to No Doubt territory again, this time wedding a distinctively Peter Hook (of New Order) influenced bass line to a sweet pop ballad." ...|$|E
500|$|Assessments vary as {{to whether}} Anderson was a {{deliberate}} impostor, delusional, traumatized into adopting a new identity, or someone used by her supporters for their own ends. Pierre Gilliard denounced Anderson as [...] "a cunning psychopath". The equation of Anderson {{with members of the}} imperial family began with Clara Peuthert in the Dalldorf Asylum, rather than with Anderson herself. Anderson appeared {{to go along with it}} afterwards. Writer Michael Thornton thought, [...] "Somewhere along the way she lost and rejected Schanzkowska. She lost that person totally and accepted completely she was this new person. I think it happened by accident and she was swept <b>along</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wave of euphoria." [...] Lord Mountbatten, a first cousin of the Romanov children, thought her supporters [...] "simply get rich on the royalties of further books, magazine articles, plays etc." [...] Prince Michael Romanov, a grandson of Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, stated the Romanov family always knew Anderson was a fraud, and that the family looked upon her and [...] "the three-ringed circus which danced around her, creating books and movies, as a vulgar insult to the memory of the Imperial Family." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{chose to}} film in Atlanta {{because of its}} proximity to Cynthiana, Kentucky, Kirkman's hometown and the setting of his comic's first issue. [...] "At the beginning they talk about how {{some of the people}} in neighboring states would have gone to larger cities so they could fortify them and protect the population." [...] Kirkman had considered other cities, particularly New York City, Miami, and Chicago. Hurd had previously filmed in the city for Lifetime. Darabont felt that Atlanta offered the essentials; [...] "Atlanta and Georgia all-told is proving to be brilliant for us in terms of what it has to offer, in terms of what the story needed, in terms of the variety of locations—it really is a fantastic place to shoot." [...] Prior to filming, Kirkman toured with Darabont around the central business district. He stated, [...] "I tagged <b>along</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> location-scouting expedition, and that was pretty fun—watching Frank Darabont walking through the streets of Atlanta as if he owned the entire city, daring cars to hit him.

500|$|In reality, {{the ships}} sighted by Tambor were the {{detachment}} of four cruisers and two destroyers Yamamoto had sent to bombard Midway.

At {{about the same}} time as this change of course, Tambor was sighted and during maneuvers designed to avoid a submarine attack, the heavy cruisers [...] and [...] collided, inflicting serious damage on Mogamis bow. The less severely damaged Mikuma slowed to [...] to keep pace. Only at 04:12 did the sky brighten enough for Murphy to be certain the ships were Japanese, by which time staying surfaced was hazardous and he dived to approach for an attack. The attack was unsuccessful and at around 06:00 he finally reported two westbound s, before diving again and playing no further role in the battle. Limping <b>along</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> straight course at 12knots—roughly one-third their top speed—Mogami and Mikuma had been almost perfect targets for a submarine attack. As soon as Tambor returned to port, Spruance had Murphy relieved of duty and reassigned to a shore station, citing his confusing contact report, poor torpedo shooting during his attack run, and general lack of aggression, especially as compared to Nautilus, the oldest of the 12 boats at Midway and the only one which had successfully placed a torpedo on target (albeit a dud).|$|E

2500|$|One of the salons said to {{have had}} an {{influence}} is Madame de Rambouillet's salon, which opened in 1618 and {{was held at the}} Hôtel de Rambouillet in Paris. It was the first and most famous salon in French history. Rambouillet made sure to distinguish her salon from an Academy, and emphasised entertainment as well as enlightenment. Like the later literary salons in the Arab world, the gatherings bore witness to the mingling of the literary elite, with male intellectuals and middle-class women. In a similar fashion to the salons in Cairo, topics such as religion, philosophy and history would be discussed, but it is noted that Rambouillet [...] "...made sure the treatment of the subject was not heavy-handed." [...] Mayy Ziyadah admired the French [...] "salonnières", and made sure to write copious materials on the well-known French hostess, habituée and prominent woman of aristocratic Parisian society, Madame de Sévigné, who was herself influenced by her time spent at the Hôtel de Rambouillet. The great Egyptian nationalist and writer, Tāhā Husayn, who began attending Ziyadah's salon after she requested Ahmad Lutfi al-Sayyid bring him <b>along</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Tuesday evening, comments on the fusion of Arab and European influences that created the salons of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries: [...] "Mayy revives by this salon a long-established Arab practice, just as she transfers to Egypt a long-established European practice, ancient and modern." ...|$|E
