5|$|Andrew Farke and {{his colleagues}} in 2014 {{published}} {{a description of a}} new neoceratopsian, Aquilops americanus, through the peer-reviewed science journal PLOS ONE. They analysed their taxa as well as most other primitive ceratopsians to get a consensus cladogram. They created their own data matrix and through it found that many groups of ceratopsians could be supported, and that Aquilops was a basal neoceratopsian that could potentially be a protoceratopsid, leptoceratopsid, or ceratopsid, although <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> groups would have a large ghost lineage with Aquilops.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} is high risk as a diver suffering from DCS may become paralysed, unconscious or stop breathing whilst under water. <b>Any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> events {{may result in}} the diver drowning or further injury to the diver during a subsequent rescue to the surface. These risks can be mitigated to some extent by using a helmet or full-face mask with voice communications on the diver, and suspending the diver from the surface so that depth is positively controlled, and by having an in-water standby diver attend the diver undergoing the treatment at all times.|$|E
5|$|Tessellation or tiling in two {{dimensions}} {{is a topic}} in geometry that studies how shapes, known as tiles, can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are {{that there must be}} no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another. The tessellations created by bonded brickwork do not obey this rule. Among those that do, a regular tessellation has both identical regular tiles and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile. There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral triangle, square, and regular hexagon. <b>Any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a plane with no gaps.|$|E

2500|$|These {{types are}} both subtypes {{of the more}} general existential type T and {{correspond}} to concrete implementation types, so <b>any</b> value <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> types is a value of type T. Given a value [...] "t" [...] of type [...] "T", we know that [...] "t.f(t.a)" [...] is well-typed, {{regardless of what the}} abstract type X is.

5|$|There {{are several}} {{well-known}} drugs and toxins that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Although <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> toxins inhibits only one enzyme in the electron transport chain, inhibition of any {{step in this}} process will halt {{the rest of the}} process. For example, if oligomycin inhibits ATP synthase, protons cannot pass back into the mitochondrion. As a result, the proton pumps are unable to operate, as the gradient becomes too strong for them to overcome. NADH is then no longer oxidized and the citric acid cycle ceases to operate because the concentration of NAD+ falls below the concentration that these enzymes can use.|$|E
5|$|The {{degree to}} which <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> forces held sway over others is unclear. Preference for one {{explanation}} over another is sometimes predicated upon a given political viewpoint. The cumulative effect of these dynamics is that {{by the beginning of}} the 20th century the Plains Aborigines were almost completely acculturated into the larger ethnic Han group, and had experienced nearly total language shift from their respective Formosan languages to Chinese. In addition, legal barriers to the use of traditional surnames persisted until the 1990s, and cultural barriers remain. Aborigines were not permitted to use their traditional names on official identification cards until 1995 when a ban on using aboriginal names dating from 1946 was finally lifted. One obstacle is that household registration forms allow a maximum of 15 characters for personal names. However, aboriginal names are still phonetically translated into Chinese characters, and many names require more than the allotted space.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{decision that}} precedes almost every {{play in a}} baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, {{as well as its}} general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, with the result being runners on base, if any, advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit {{to one side of the}} field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.|$|E
50|$|The {{last point}} is {{possible}} because the session manager maintains {{a set of}} properties for every client (in the X Window System terminology, a property is simply a container for data). <b>These</b> pieces <b>of</b> information can be modified by the client at <b>any</b> time. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> properties is named , and contains the information on how the client has to be started again.|$|R
5000|$|Stevens also {{devised a}} number of basic {{starting}} points for improvisation.

25|$|For example, the {{invariant}} core residues G5, G8, G12 and C3 in {{the minimal}} hammerhead ribozyme were each observed {{to be so}} fragile that changing even a single exocyclic functional group on <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> nucleotides results in a dramatic reduction or abolition of catalytic activity, yet few of these appeared to form hydrogen bonds involving the Watson-Crick faces of these nucleotide bases {{in any of the}} minimal hammerhead structures, apart from a G-5 interaction in the product structure.|$|E
25|$|In enzymes, {{the protein}} {{structure}} orients a few, key amino acids into precise geometries {{to form an}} active site to perform chemistry.
