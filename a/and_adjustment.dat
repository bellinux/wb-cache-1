These factors are not easily estimated, so the calculated value for breathing duration will be more than the real value.|$|E
5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to young people, {{who are at}} a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet the importance of sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem <b>and</b> <b>adjustment</b> to life post-injury. People who are able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life.|$|E
5|$|The Oliver Typewriter Company {{had begun}} {{operating}} in 1895, with its headquarters {{on the ninth}} floor of a building {{on the corner of}} Clark and Randolph Street in Chicago. In 1896, manufacturing moved from Iowa to Woodstock, Illinois, when the City of Woodstock donated a vacant factory once used by the Wheeler and Tappan Company on the condition that the Oliver Typewriter Company remain there at least five years. Manufacturing was divided into six departments: type bar, carriage, assembly, tabulators <b>and</b> <b>adjustment,</b> inspection, and an aligning room. The company's headquarters moved to the Oliver Building, now a Chicago landmark on the National Register of Historic Places, when it was completed in 1907.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, {{letters from}} readers in The Ladder {{appeared}} that expressed exasperation {{with the emphasis}} on conformity in the DOB. In the 1970s, Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon reflected that by contemporary standards, the early ideals of the DOB for integration <b>and</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the lesbian into society were outmoded, but they remembered that in the 1950s and early 1960s many gay men and lesbians considered those ideals unreachable, and this approach radical. The DOB never had the number of members comparable to the Mattachine Society's. Although some may have considered the DOB's ideals unrealistic, some also considered them too tame.|$|E

However, the restructuring <b>and</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs required to prevent the collapse of local industries, particularly in developing countries, is a global concern. For example, a late 2009 study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the United Nations Development Programme and the Kenyan Institute for Research and Policy Analysis found that Kenya would see gains in its exports of flowers, tea, coffee and oil seeds. It would concurrently lose in the tobacco and grains markets, as well as manufacturing of textiles and footwear, machinery and equipment.|$|E

25|$|The reverse parking {{procedure}} is virtually {{identical to the}} parallel parking procedure. The driver approaches the parking space, moving forward and turning, positioning the car in place for backing into the reverse parking spot. The vehicle rear has to be facing the reverse parking spot, allowing the backup camera to 'see' the parking area. Shifting to reverse automatically activates the backup camera system, and the driver selects the reverse park guidance button on the navigation/camera touchscreen (the grid appears with green or red lines, a flag symbol representing {{the corner of the}} parking spot, <b>and</b> <b>adjustment</b> arrows; reverse parking adds rotation selection). After checking the parking space and engaging the reverse park procedure, the same exact parking process occurs as the car reverse parks into the spot.|$|E

In the end, suitable colour film stock for the cameras could not be found and the footage was shot {{in black and white}}. The following episode, transmitted Monday 3 November, was videotaped in colour but featured black and white film inserts and title sequence. Like BBC1, the ITV network was officially broadcast in black and white at this point (though programmes were actually broadcast in colour as early as July that year for colour transmission testing <b>and</b> <b>adjustment)</b> so the episode was seen by most in black and white.|$|E
25|$|Agricultural {{policy is}} the set of {{government}} decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies {{with the goal of}} achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management <b>and</b> <b>adjustment</b> (including policies related to climate change, food safety and natural disasters), economic stability (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and environmental sustainability (especially water policy), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries). Agricultural policy can also touch on food quality, ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and conservation. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.|$|E
