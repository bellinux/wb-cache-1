25|$|For nucleic acids, urea is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used denaturant. For proteins, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is an anionic detergent applied to protein samples to coat proteins in order to impart two negative charges (from every SDS molecule) to every two amino acids of the denatured protein. 2-Mercaptoethanol may also be used to disrupt the disulfide bonds found between the protein complexes, which helps further denature the protein. In most proteins, the binding of SDS to the polypeptide chain imparts an even distribution of charge per unit mass, thereby resulting in a fractionation by approximate size during electrophoresis. Proteins that have a greater hydrophobic content – for instance, many membrane proteins, and those that interact with surfactants in their native environment – are intrinsically harder to treat accurately using this method, due to the greater variability in the ratio of bound SDS. Procedurally, using both Native <b>and</b> <b>SDS-PAGE</b> together can be used to purify and to separate the various subunits of the protein. Native-PAGE keeps the oligomeric form intact and will show a band on the gel that is representative of the level of activity. SDS-PAGE will denature and separate the oligomeric form into its monomers, showing bands that are representative of their molecular weights. These bands can be used to assess the purity of and identify the protein.|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} novel {{strategy}} to immobilize {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) -coated proteins for fully integrated microfluidic Western blotting. Polyacrylamide gel copolymerized with a cationic polymer, poly-l-lysine, effectively immobilizes all sized proteins after sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (<b>SDS-PAGE),</b> <b>and</b> enables <b>SDS-PAGE</b> <b>and</b> subsequent immuno-probing in an automated microfluidic chip. Design of a poly-l-lysine conjugated polyacrylamide gel allows optimization of SDS-protein immobilization strength in the blotting gel region of the microchamber. The dependence of protein capture behavior on both the concentration of copolymerized charges and poly-lysine length is studied and gives important insight into an electrostatic immobilization mechanism. Based on analysis of protein conformation, the immobilized proteins bind with partner antibody after SDS dilution.
