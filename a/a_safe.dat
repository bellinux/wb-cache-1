40|$|This study {{examines}} {{willingness to pay}} (WTP) in Bangladesh for arsenic (<b>As)</b> <b>safe</b> drinking water across different As-risk zones, applying a double bound discrete choice value elicitation approach. The study aims to provide a robust estimate {{of the benefits of}} <b>As</b> <b>safe</b> drinking water supply, which is compared to the results from a similar study published almost 10 years ago using a single bound estimation procedure. Tests show that the double bound valuation design does not suffer from anchoring or incentive incompatibility effects. Health risk awareness levels are high and households are willing to pay on average about 5 percent of their disposable average annual household income for <b>As</b> <b>safe</b> drinking water. Important factors influencing WTP include the bid amount to construct communal deep tubewell for <b>As</b> <b>safe</b> water supply, the risk zone where respondents live, household income, water consumption, awareness of water source contamination, whether household members are affected by As contamination, and whether they already take mitigation measures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
