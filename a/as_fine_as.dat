5|$|In 2001, {{paleontologist}} Phil Currie reported skin impressions {{from the}} holotype specimen of G. libratus. He originally reported the skin as being essentially smooth and lacking the scales {{found in other}} dinosaurs, similar to the secondarily featherless skin found in large modern birds. Scales of some sort were present in this specimen, but they are reportedly widely dispersed {{from each other and}} very small. Other patches of isolated Gorgosaurus skin shows denser, and larger though still relatively fine scales (smaller than hadrosaurid scales and approximately <b>as</b> <b>fine</b> <b>as</b> a Gila monster's). Neither of these specimens was associated with any particular bone or specific body area. In the Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs Kenneth Carpenter pointed out that traces of skin impressions from the tail of Gorgosaurus showed similar small rounded or hexagonal scales.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of particles (pyroclasts) with diameters <2 mm (particles >2 mm {{are classified as}} lapilli), and can be <b>as</b> <b>fine</b> <b>as</b> 1 μm. The overall grain size distribution of ash can vary greatly with different magma compositions. Few {{attempts have been made}} to correlate the grain size characteristics of a deposit with those of the event which produced it, though some predictions can be made. Rhyolitic magmas generally produce finer grained material compared to basaltic magmas, due to the higher viscosity and therefore explosivity. The proportions of fine ash are higher for silicic explosive eruptions, probably because vesicle size in the pre-eruptive magma is smaller than those in mafic magmas. There is good evidence that pyroclastic flows produce high proportions of fine ash by communition and it is likely that this process also occurs inside volcanic conduits and would be most efficient when the magma fragmentation surface is well below the summit crater.|$|E

[...] Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "In craftsmanship and delicacy of drawing and coloring, in the articulation of its dozens of characters, in the greater variety and depth of its photographic effects, it tops the high standard Snow White set. The charm, humor and loving care with which it treats its inanimate characters puts it {{in a class by}} itself."

500|$|There {{are only}} four other known survivals, secular or religious, of basse taille enamel on gold, one the small Salting Reliquary, {{also in the}} British Museum, and none <b>as</b> <b>fine</b> <b>as</b> the cup. The [...] "King John Cup" [...] in King's Lynn, of ca. 1340, silver-gilt with {{transparent}} enamel, is {{the best example of}} basse-taille work probably made in England; the metalwork expert Herbert Maryon describes this and the Royal Gold Cup as the [...] "two examples of outstanding merit, unsurpassed in any collection." [...] However it is unclear if most of the enamel at King's Lynn is original. The closest comparison to the Royal Gold Cup is perhaps the silver-gilt Mérode Cup of about 1400, which is the only surviving medieval example of plique á jour enamel, a difficult technique which creates a see-through effect like stained glass. A silver-gilt cup in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam of before 1376 has no enamels or gems, and a different shape, but offers an interesting comparison as it has a tripod stand with winged grotesques as legs, a short stem, and the cover has both an elaborate finial and a raised decorated strip around the rim, so that all the altered aspects of the Royal Gold Cup are present.|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette {{praised the}} show and said the {{decision}} to focus on fewer subplots might help. Bianco said, [...] "Let's hope the changes work, because Homicide is too good to lose, and its vision of civilization is too troubling to shunt aside." [...] The Washington Post television reviewer Tom Shales called Homicide [...] "achingly, even painfully, brilliant. The best cop show I have ever seen." [...] David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun called it the best police drama ever made for television besides Hill Street Blues. Baltimore Sun reporter David Bianculli praised the show's writers for being willing to place their characters in ethically questionable positions, adding: [...] "Please watch this series; it's so good, I don't mind pleading." [...] Tom Jicha of South Florida Sun-Sentinel called it [...] "an hour about <b>as</b> <b>fine</b> <b>as</b> there is on the tube" [...] with great writing and camera-work. Jicha said, [...] "It would be a senseless act of violence against superb TV for those who claim to appreciate fine drama to kill this show by turning the dial." [...] Hal Boedeker, television critic with The Miami Herald, strongly praised the series, particularly [...] "Bop Gun", which he called [...] "the highest order for network TV". Boedeker called the writing, direction and acting [...] "first-rate" [...] and declared Homicide the better choice over NYPD Blue {{because it did not}} resort to gimmicks like the nudity featured in the latter show.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] was generally positive with many journalists comparing the song {{to the work}} of other groups. Writing for the NME, Ted Kessler described the track as [...] "Status Quo for Generation X-ers with a Manhattan Portage full of millennial tension" [...] and went on to ask [...] "who said there was anything wrong with that?" [...] in his review of the song on its release as a single, despite his earlier review of Rings Around the World claiming that the album would benefit from the removal of the [...] "Status Quo-ish title track". Q described the track as [...] "excellent" [...] while PopMatters claimed the song [...] "sounds so much like ELO that it blows away everything on last year's ELO reunion album" [...] and the Dallas Observer stated that [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] is a [...] "Beach Boys/Beatles/ELO homage <b>as</b> <b>fine</b> <b>as</b> the '70s heyday of Roy Wood's Wizzard or very early Cheap Trick".Pitchfork Media stated that the song [...] "takes the upbeat Britpop of their debut album and layers on spectral details" [...] while Uncut described the track as [...] "tooled up rock 'n' roll modelled on [...] "Surfin' USA". The Guardian claimed the song's lyrics tackle environmental issues with a [...] "sharp wit" [...] while Drowned in Sound saw them as evidence that chief songwriter Gruff Rhys was [...] "taking his lyrics a little bit more seriously". The song was placed at number 21 in the 2001 Festive Fifty on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show. [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] appeared on the soundtrack to the 2001 film Me Without You.|$|E
500|$|According to a diary entry made by John Roberts of Paradise, Utah in 1902, Joseph Smith {{gave the}} White Horse Prophecy in early May 1843, {{during the period}} in which the Latter Day Saints were {{headquartered}} in Nauvoo, Illinois. [...] Smith is recorded as saying that the Mormons [...] "will go to the Rocky Mountains and will be a great and mighty people established there, which I will call the White Horse of peace and safety." [...] Adding that [...] "I shall never go there" [...] and predicting continued persecution by enemies of the church, Smith reportedly said that [...] "You will see the Constitution of the United States almost destroyed. [...] It will hang like a thread <b>as</b> <b>fine</b> <b>as</b> a silk fiber.... I love the Constitution; it was made by the inspiration of God; and it will be preserved and saved by the efforts of the White Horse, and by the Red Horse who will combine in its defense." [...] Smith additionally said, according to the diary, that the Mormons would send missionaries to [...] "gather the honest in heart from among the Pale Horse, or people of the United States, to stand by the Constitution of the United States as it was given by the inspiration of God." [...] Roberts' account quotes Smith as predicting numerous wars involving Great Britain, France, Russia, China, and other countries, and saying that the European nobility [...] "knows that [...] is true, but it has not pomp enough, and grandeur and influence for them to yet embrace it." [...] He is also reported to have said that a temple which the Latter Day Saints had planned to build in Jackson County, Missouri [...] "will be built in this generation." ...|$|E
