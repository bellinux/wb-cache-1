IR light produces Red-Eye effect making the pupil to shine more than in normal lighting conditions. The location of the eyes and the face contour are computed from the IR images using a collection of image processing techniques. The algorithm operates on gray images {{under a variety of}} skin tones, eye colors, angles, and illuminations. The developed method analyzes two consecutive frames where the first one is taken under regular illumination with <b>no</b> <b>IR</b> and the second one using IR in order to facilitate eye detection for subjects wearing glasses...|$|R
