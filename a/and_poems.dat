5|$|One of {{the most}} famous poet in this type of poetry is Hafez. Themes of his Ghazal is exposing hypocrisy. His life <b>and</b> <b>poems</b> {{have been the subject of}} much analysis, {{commentary}} and interpretation, influencing post-fourteenth century Persian writing more than any other author. West-östlicher Diwan of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe that is a collection of lyrical poems, has been inspired by the Persian poet Hafez.|$|E
5|$|Riley {{was quickly}} {{becoming}} wealthy from {{his books and}} touring, earning nearly $20,000 in 1888.

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{question the}} poet's sexuality, theorizing that the numerous letters <b>and</b> <b>poems</b> that were dedicated to Susan Gilbert Dickinson indicate a lesbian romance, and speculating {{about how this}} may have influenced her poetry. Critics such as John Cody, Lillian Faderman, Vivian R. Pollak, Paula Bennett, Judith Farr, Ellen Louise Hart, and Martha Nell Smith have argued that Susan was the central erotic relationship in Dickinson's life.|$|E

5|$|Arthur is {{a central}} figure in the legends making up the Matter of Britain. The legendary Arthur {{developed}} as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). In some Welsh and Breton tales <b>and</b> <b>poems</b> that date from before this work, Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn. How much of Geoffrey's Historia (completed in 1138) was adapted from such earlier sources, rather than invented by Geoffrey himself, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Between 1932 and 1938, Soeman {{published}} two further novels, Kasih Tersesat (Lost Love; serialized in Pandji Poestaka in 1932) and Teboesan Darah (Blood Payment; {{published in}} Doenia Pengalaman in 1939). This latter novel marked {{the return of}} Sir Joon, who had featured in several other detective stories by other authors. Soeman also published thirty-five short stories <b>and</b> <b>poems,</b> mostly in the magazine Pandji Poestaka but also in Pedoman Masjarakat and Poedjangga Baroe. Seven of Soeman's Pandji Poestaka stories were compiled in Kawan Bergeloet (Playmate), together with five original stories. With this collection, published in 1941, Soeman {{became one of the}} first short story writers in the Indonesian literary canon.|$|E
5|$|From 1885 {{until his}} death in 1908 his work was {{dominated}} by prose <b>and</b> <b>poems.</b> The 1895 prose text Der Schmetterling contains autobiographical accounts. Peter's enchantment by the witch Lucinde, of whom he regards himself a slave, is possibly in reference to Johanna Kessler. Peter, like Busch, returns to his birthplace. It is similar in style to the romantic travel story that Ludwig Tieck established with his 1798 Franz Sternbald's Wanderungen. Busch plays with its traditional forms, motifs, pictures, literary topics and form of narration.|$|E

Swiss Alpine scenery inspired several poems, {{some of which were}} later published. In 1924 she met Walter Beck, a naturalised German employed by his family's cosmetics firm. The couple became engaged, and enjoyed regular weekends together, signing hotel registers as a married couple using false names.|$|E
5|$|In Toraja society, {{the funeral}} ritual {{is the most}} {{elaborate}} and expensive event. The richer and more powerful the individual, the more expensive is the funeral. In the aluk religion, only nobles {{have the right to}} have an extensive death feast. The death feast of a nobleman is usually attended by thousands and lasts for several days. A ceremonial site, called rante, is usually prepared in a large, grassy field where shelters for audiences, rice barns, and other ceremonial funeral structures are specially made by the deceased family. Flute music, funeral chants, songs <b>and</b> <b>poems,</b> and crying and wailing are traditional Toraja expressions of grief with the exceptions of funerals for young children, and poor, low-status adults.|$|E
5|$|In late 1888 he {{finished}} {{work on a}} fourth book, Pipes o' Pan at Zekesbury which was released to great acclaim in the United States. Based on a fictional town in Indiana, Riley presented many stories <b>and</b> <b>poems</b> about its citizens and way of life. It received mixed reviews among literary critics who wrote of it that Riley's stories were not of the same quality as his poetry. The book was very popular with the public and went through numerous reprints.|$|E

5|$|Local {{opinion was}} heavily against Thornton. Pamphlets were sold {{purporting}} to show Thornton's guilt, <b>and</b> <b>poems</b> were composed {{with the same}} theme. The defendant's solicitor complained of these, alleging it {{made it hard to}} find an unbiased jury. On 8 August 1817, people filled {{the street in front of}} County Hall in Warwick, where the trial was to take place. When the judge, Sir George Sowley Holroyd (a justice of the Court of King's Bench) began proceedings at 8a.m., people rushed to fill the available seating, and the public benches remained full throughout the one-day trial. Because of the nature of the evidence, women were not permitted to witness the trial.|$|E

5|$|The sea plays a {{major role}} in Homer's epic poem the Odyssey, {{describing}} the ten-year voyage of the Greek hero Odysseus who struggles to return home across the sea, encountering sea monsters along the way. In the Middle Ages, the sea appears in romances such as the Tristan legend, with motifs such as mythical islands and self-propelled ships.

This was first published in 1908 after having been rediscovered in manuscript ten years earlier. His poetry likewise was first published in 1903 and 1910 (The Poetical Works of Thomas Traherne, B.D. <b>and</b> <b>Poems</b> of Felicity).

5|$|Through the association, Riley became {{acquainted with}} most of the notable writers in the midwestern United States, {{including}} humorist Edgar Wilson Nye of Chicago. After completing his lecture circuit in 1885, Riley formed a partnership with Nye and his agent to begin a new tour. The Redpath Bureau agreed to allow Riley to tour with Nye, provided he maintained his financial agreements with them. In addition to touring, Riley and Nye collaborated to write a book, Nye and Riley's Railway Guide, a collection of humorous anecdotes <b>and</b> <b>poems</b> intended to parody popular tourist literature of the day. Published in 1888, the book was somewhat successful and had three reprints.|$|E
