Jews {{played a key role}} in developing these prototypes of today's health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). The growing success of these services threatened private practitioners in a number of ways. They formed a trade union and took militant <b>action.</b> <b>Stage</b> <b>by</b> <b>stage,</b> the profession asserted its dominance, culminating in an alliance with the National Socialists and Hitler to take over these services and to purge them of socialist and Jewish physicians. Medical societies assisted Hitler in his policies of "purification," and the health care delivery systems shifted from being local, patient-centered, and health-oriented to being national, physician-centered, and focused on curing illness. After World War II, these changes were not reversed as part of denazification, and 40 years later, social medicine has yet to recover...|$|R

50|$|This fallacy {{is similar}} to the {{slippery}} slope, where the opposition claims that if a restricted action under debate is allowed, such as allowing people with glaucoma to use medical marijuana, then the <b>action</b> will <b>by</b> <b>stages</b> become acceptable in general, such as eventually everyone being allowed to use marijuana. The two arguments imply there is no difference between the exception and the rule, and in fact fallacious slippery slope arguments often use the converse accident to the contrary {{as the basis for the}} argument. However, a key difference between the two is the point and position being argued. The above argument using converse accident is an argument for full legal use of marijuana given that glaucoma patients use it. The argument based on the slippery slope argues against medicinal use of marijuana because it will lead to full use.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{reports on}} an {{instance}} of direct political action undertaken {{in the form of}} a boycott of a school canteen. The <b>action</b> was <b>staged</b> <b>by</b> students at the school, following redevelopment through a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) project. The young people’s experiences of the boycott and its impact on their learning were analysed in the context of a larger, interpretative study exploring the relationships between democratic education and the arts. The research offers some important insights into the nature of young people’s political engagement and suggests some important implications for democratic education. Specifically it indicates that – at least in the case of the participants in this study – young people are not politically disengaged but are rather differently engaged, and that such engagement can act as an important resource within a critical approach to democratic education...|$|R

40|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} a major health issue for Indigenous Australians, however there are few {{interventions}} with demonstrated efficacy in this population. The Transtheoretical Model may provide a useful framework for describing smoking behaviour and assessing readiness to quit, {{with the aim of}} developing better interventions. Interviews were conducted with 593 Indigenous Australians in eight rural and remote communities in north Queensland, to examine stages of change and smoking behaviour. Among current smokers, 39. 6 % and 43. 4 % were in Precontemplation and Contemplation stages respectively. A further 13. 9 % were making preparations to quit (Preparation) whilst only 3. 2 % said they were actively trying to quit (<b>Action).</b> When analysed <b>by</b> <b>stage</b> of change, the pattern of smoking-related behaviours conformed to the results of past research using the model. Importantly however, distribution of individuals across the stages opposes those observed in investigations of smoking behaviour in non-Indigenous Australian populations. The Transtheoretical Model can be used to meaningfully classify Indigenous smokers in remote north Queensland according to stages along the behaviour change continuum. Importantly, in this large sample across eight communities, most Indigenous smokers were not making preparations to change their smoking behaviour. This suggests that interventions should focus on promoting movement toward the Preparation and Action stages of change...|$|R
40|$|Abstract] Delivered on stage, {{featuring}} a protagonist role on stage, language feels {{in its natural}} element of performance and transfiguration, which are the very elements of theatre at its best. The fundamental idea of performance (change dealing to surmounting) symbiotically embraces in fact both the theatrical and the narrative process. Conflict and the overcoming of conflict constitute {{the ebb and flow}} of all drama, as well as of story-telling. The blending of both modes, doing and telling, resulting in the doing of telling on stage, characterises much of the Irish modern and contemporary theatre. This is not theatre propelled <b>by</b> <b>action</b> on <b>stage,</b> but theatre of language in performance, in which central dramatic tension stems from the multiple imbalance between life, story and self (Morrison, 1983 : 1), “a drama between body and speech” (Puchner, 2002 : 169). This paper approaches two examples of narrative performativity on twentieth-century Irish stage: Yeats’s seminal piece Purgatory (1938) and Tom Murphy’s unique Bailegangaire (1985) ...|$|R

40|$|The paper aims at {{investigating}} {{an innovative}} {{approach in the}} field of sustainability assessment of territorial transformations, where the necessity of decision support tools permitting to consider simultaneously the different aspects of the problem {{is becoming more and more}} apparent. In particular, we propose an interactive use of the Dominance-based Rough Sets Approach (DRSA, Greco et al., 2001). The methodology well facilitates the discussion among Decision Makers (DMs) and technical experts. The method is based on the use of a preference model expressed in terms of easily understandable "if … then" decision rules, induced from a preference information easily given by the DM in terms of indication of relatively good actions from a given sample. The method consists of organizing the search of the most preferred <b>action</b> <b>by</b> alternating <b>stages</b> of calculation and dialogue. The calculation stage aims at inducing decision rules and applying them to new actions, while in the dialogue stage the DMs react to the proposal revealing them preferences, that are taken into account in the next stage of calculation. The procedure stops when the DMs find an action satisfactory to be selected. We propose to apply this methodology in decisions-aiding processes concerning urban and territorial projects. In particular, we present an application to the choice of the location for a municipal solid waste plant in the Province of Turin (Italy). In the application, 39 sites are analysed and compared through the use of the DRSA on the basis of different attributes, such as presence of population, hydrogeological risk, agricultural value, interferences on transport infrastructures and economic cost. From the point of view of Multiple Criteria Decision Aid, the results of the application show that the DRSA offers a useful tool for reasoning about the data involved in the decision problem at hand and that it is suitable to elicitate the DMs' preferences and to support them by explaining and justifying the final choic...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} will be to produce a {{critical}} analysis of subversive artistic practices. I intend to assess if {{and to what extent}} creative forms of political direct actions can be considered forms of artistic and ontological experimentations. Post-anarchism will be used as the political-ethical horizon in relation to which to position this kind of artistic subversive actions. With its ethics of anti-authoritarianism and equal-liberty, post-anarchist movements and groups seem indeed to be engaged in a constant revision of the relations of power through the ethical practices of freedom and emancipation. The artistic interventions presented in this thesis are forms of political direct <b>action</b> <b>staged</b> <b>by</b> anti-authoritarian groups and movements and can be read as part and result of a process of de-subjectivation and of the subsequent process of self-formation, self-mastery and self-organisation that feed autonomy and emancipation. The actions of frontal opposition discussed here will be presented as examples of the numerous experimental practices that want to produce new subjectivities as means of resistance and emancipation. They will be seen as experimental artistic practices of emancipation that allow liberty and equality to emerge in unpredictable creative ways. The artistic practices and political actions of Voina, Dost je!, Atopie and RTS represent a powerful source of creative and experimental force for rejecting the established formal channels of power and for breaking the “police order”...|$|R

40|$|The simple {{primordium}} of {{the inner}} ear (otocyst) differentiates into many cell types, including sensory neurons and hair cells. We examined expression of the divergent homeobox transcription factor, cProx 1, during otocyst development in chickens. Nuclear cProx 1 protein is not evident in the otic placode but emerges in the otic cup <b>by</b> <b>stage</b> 12. At stage 16, cProx 1 -positive nuclei are scattered continuously throughout the neuroepithelium, from anteroventral to posteromedial. These labeled cells are neural precursors; they express betaIII-tubulin and migrate to the cochleovestibular ganglion between stages 13 and 21. <b>By</b> <b>stage</b> 18, two areas develop a dense pattern of cProx 1 expression in which every nucleus is labeled. These areas emerge at the anterior and posterior extremes of the band of scattered cProx 1 expression and express the sensory markers cSerrate 1 and Cath 1 <b>by</b> <b>stage</b> 23. Four discrete patches of dense cProx 1 expression appear <b>by</b> <b>stage</b> 23 that correspond to the future superior crista, lateral crista, saccular macula, and posterior crista, as confirmed by immunolabeling for hair cell antigen (HCA) <b>by</b> <b>stage</b> 29. The remaining sensory epithelia display a dense pattern of cProx 1 expression and label for HCA <b>by</b> <b>stage</b> 29. In the basilar papilla, nuclear cProx 1 expression is down-regulated in most hair cells <b>by</b> <b>stage</b> 37 and in many supporting cells <b>by</b> <b>stage</b> 40.
