40|$|Abstract:- All {{the factors}} of {{atmospheric}} environment {{that influence the}} transmission of infrared radiation were analyzed in detail in the paper. Taking horizontally varying <b>atmospheric</b> <b>property</b> into consideration, a 3 D model of atmospheric transmission of infrared radiation is established based on MODTRAN 4. Moreover, the methods of calculating the ratio of atmospheric transmission, path radiation and single scatter solar radiation are presented. This 3 D model is running by using the spectral database generated by MODTRAN 4. It can handle attenuation of infrared radiation through the 3 D atmosphere when target is below 60 km. Implementation details are also presented...|$|E

30|$|In {{this context}} it is {{important}} to bear in mind that uncertainty embedded in the models is large and only partly quantifiable (van der Linden and Mitchell (Eds.), 2009). This restricts the applicability of rigorous statistical significance tests. Therefore the robustness of the resultsn is {{to be taken into account}} (Parker, 2011). In case of probability distributions of an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>property</b> in a future climate this can be assessed by looking at (i) the sensitivity concerning assumptions that are currently under debateo and (ii) the near-future continuity in the projections, i.e., if they are subject to unplausible major change with the incremental development of the models (Parker, 2010).|$|E

40|$|Radiative {{transfer}} {{in the atmosphere}} is the backbone of any <b>atmospheric</b> <b>property</b> retrieval. The determination of clouds, aerosols, trace gases or surface properties from space observations {{is based on an}} accurate forward modeling of radiation. The "Intercomparison of 3 D Radiation Codes" (I 3 RC, [URL] has been initiated in the late 1990 s. It is an ongoing project aimed at the comparison and improvement of three-dimensional radiative transfer models - a highly sophisticated class of models which allow to quantitatively calculate radiative transfer through highly inhomogeneous atmospheres, in particular clouds. Although these codes at present cannot be used in an operational sense - due to their high computational demands and the often limited resolution of satellite sensors - they allow the simulation of benchmark cases which may serve as a framework to test operational retrievals. The talk will explain the relevance of three-dimensional radiative transfer and show how the I 3 RC can help to quality control satellite products and algorithms. The first two phases of the I 3 RC, finished in 1999 and 2000, showed that state-of-the-art 3 D codes may agree at the 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{approach}} was {{to simulate the}} surface environment of Venus as closely as practicable and to conduct experiments to determine threshold wind speeds, particle flux, particle velocities, and the characteristics of various aeolian bedforms. The Venus Wind Tunnel (VWT) is described and the experimental procedures that were developed to make the high-pressure wind tunnel measurements are presented. In terrestrial simulations of aeolian activity, {{it is possible to}} conduct experiments under pressures and temperatures found in natural environments. Because of the high pressures and temperatures, Venusian simulations are difficult to achieve in this regard. Consequently, extrapolation of results to Venue potentially involves unknown factors. The experimental rationale was developed in the following way: The VWT enables the density of the Venusian atmosphere to be reproduced. Density is the principal <b>atmospheric</b> <b>property</b> for governing saltation threshold, particle flux, and the ballistics of airborne particles (equivalent density maintains dynamic similarity of gas flow). When operated at or near Earth's ambient temperature, VWT achieves Venusian atmospheric density at pressures of about 30 bar, or about one third less than those on Venus, although still maintaining dynamic similarity to Venus...|$|E

40|$|Earth {{observation}} data {{acquired in}} the optical region require atmospheric correction {{before they can be}} used quantitatively. Most operational methods of atmospheric correction assume that the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>properties</b> are uniform across the image, but this assumption is unlikely to be valid for large images. This study aims to characterize the spatial variation in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>properties</b> over a typical mid-latitude area (southern England), and to assess the errors that would result from applying a scene-based atmospheric correction to data collected under this variable atmosphere. Two key <b>atmospheric</b> <b>properties</b> – aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and precipitable water content (PWC) – are assessed over two clear days in June 2006, and results show an AOT range of approximately 0. 1 – 0. 5 and a PWC range of 1. 5 – 3. 0 cm. Radiative transfer modelling shows that errors in reflectance of up to 1. 7 percentage points, and up to a 5 % change in normalized difference vegetation index, can be caused by AOT variability, but that PWC variability has minimal effects. Sensitivity analyses also show that the high uncertainty of many data sources used to provide AOT values for atmospheric correction may also lead to significant errors in the resulting products. The spatial variability of the atmosphere cannot be ignored, and we are in need of operational, generic methods to perform a spatially variable atmospheric correction...|$|R

This allows comparing, in terms of energy imbalance and temperature, the climate change observed between 1880 and 2003 and that given by the model. Then, the model is used to predict future climate changes depending on several scenarios for the increase of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>properties.</b> This approach proves that the constructal law can help in defining new scenarios in relation to carbon emission policies.
