40|$|The {{importance}} of Threat Appraisal {{in the relationship}} between stress and alcohol addiction was examined in this theses. Three studies assessing Threat Appraisal in relation to coping, resources <b>and</b> arousal, among <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> adult children of <b>alcoholics.</b> Reliable <b>and</b> valid measures of Threat Appraisal and Threat Centred Beliefs were developed. Study 1 comprised 63 male <b>and</b> 26 female <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> 37 male and 16 female controls. Subjects were compared on measures of Threat Appraisal, Threat-Centred Beliefs, trait-anxiety and coping In the second study 61 daughters and 25 sons of alcoholics, 59 female controls and 29 male controls completed measures of Threat Appraisals, Threat-Centred Beliefs, social support, self-esteem and self-awareness. The sample included 30 non-university students of <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> 28 non-university controls. Study 3 examined heart rate and electrodermal activity in a stressful interview situation among 7 sons and 7 daughters of <b>alcoholics,</b> <b>and</b> 7 female and 7 male controls, all of whom were university students. Subjects were also compared on measures of threat Appraisal, autonomic arousal according to Threat Appraisal levels, trait anxiety and coping. Results indicated that alcoholics perceived greater stress in their everyday lives than non-alcoholics, and this frequent stress was {{associated with the use of}} less adaptive coping strategies. Having an alcoholic parent among the non-university subjects contributed to low social support and high self-awareness, which further contributed to the frequent experience of high threat and rick of developing alcoholism. Results also suggested that sons of <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> males who perceived great stress from hassles, physiologically hyperreact to stress, whilst daughters of <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> females who perceived great stress from hassles hyporeact to stress. Generally, the theoretical model was supported, and further specified by qualifications relating mainly to gender and educational status...|$|R

5|$|Greed is a 1924 American silent film, {{written and}} {{directed}} by Erich von Stroheim and based on the 1899 Frank Norris novel McTeague. It stars Gibson Gowland as Dr. John McTeague, ZaSu Pitts as his wife Trina Sieppe and Jean Hersholt as McTeague's friend and eventual enemy Marcus Schouler. The film tells the story of McTeague, a San Francisco dentist, who marries his best friend Schouler's girlfriend Trina. Shortly after their engagement, Trina wins a lottery prize of $5,000, at that time a substantial sum. Schouler jealously informs the authorities that McTeague had been practicing dentistry without a license, and McTeague and Trina become impoverished. While living in squalor, McTeague becomes a violent <b>alcoholic</b> <b>and</b> Trina becomes greedily obsessed with her winnings, refusing to spend any of them, despite how poor she and her husband have become. Eventually McTeague murders Trina for the money and flees to Death Valley. Schouler catches up with him there for a final confrontation.|$|E

40|$|Alcohol is an {{addictive}} {{substance that}} is often misused worldwide, including in Indonesia. Ninety percent of the alcohol that enters the body will be metabolized in the liver using the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme. It is important to determine the activity of ADH enzyme and ADH 3 gene polymorphism on <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> non-alcoholics in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The aim {{of the study is}}  to determine ADH activity and identify ADH 3 gene polymorphism of <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> non-alcoholics in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. This study was an observational study with a cross-sectional design method. Blood samples were taken from 71 Javanese <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> 71 non-alcoholics of Javanese descent in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The participants were initially requested to sign an informed consent form. Examination of ADH enzyme activity used the spectrophotometry method and ADH 3 gene polymorphism was assessed with PCR-RFLP using Ssp I restriction enzyme. The activity of ADH enzyme in all individuals appeared to be a slower type. The average of the ethanol value of <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> non-alcoholics were 0. 05554 mM and 0. 0758 mM respectively. Gene type of alcoholics were ADH 3 * 2 (75. 4 %), ADH 3 * 1 / 3 * 2 (21. 5 %), and ADH 3 * 1 (3. 1 %), and non-alcoholics were ADH 3 * 2 (88. 6 %), ADH 3 * 1 / 3 * 2 (10. 0 %), and ADH 3 * 1 (1. 4 %). There {{were no significant differences between}} the activity of ADH with polymorphism of ADH 3 gene in either <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> non-alcoholics (p> 0, 05). Conclusion: The activity of ADH enzyme in all participants appeared to be a slower type. Most of the ADH 3 gene polymorphism of <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> non-alcoholics were both ADH 3 * 2 (75. 4 % and 88. 6 %). There was no differences of ADH enzyme activity with ADH 3 gene polymorphism between <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> non-alcoholics of Javanese population in Yogyakarta, Indonesia...|$|R

40|$|Serum gamma glutamyl {{transpeptidase}} (GGTP), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD), ornithine carbamoyl transferase (OCT), alanine aminotransferase (AlT), aspartate aminotransferase (AsT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities were assayed in 67 <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> 40 drug dependent patients. Bilirubin, total protein, albumin, and globulin were also measured. GGTP elevation was observed in 48 % of <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> in 50 % of drug dependents. The incidences of elevated levels of other enzymes were: ICD 39 and 38 - 7 %; OCT 23 - 7 and 36 - 1 %; AlT 30 and 33 %; AsT 24 - 2 and 21 - 7 %; ALP 10 - 4 and 5 % respectively.

40|$|Abstract — Event-related {{potentials}} (ERPs) {{have been}} shown to be different between <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> non-alcoholics. Of particular interest to investigators has been the P 300 wave. Because it has been shown that alcohol-induced neural damage can alter P 300 waves, particularly amplitude, we attempted to examine alcoholics who most likely suffered little damage because they drank heavily for relatively few years (mean = 6. 9 years). The effects of long-term sobriety (mean = 5. 0 years) were also investigated to determine if cognitive functioning, as measured by auditory-evoked P 3 O 0 waves, varies with increased abstinence. Because family history for alcoholism has also been shown to influence P 300 amplitude <b>and</b> latency, <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> controls with and without family history were examined. The alcoholic group had significantly longer latencies in P 300 measures in both the family history positive and negative groups; P 300 amplitudes between <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> non-alcoholics did not vary, regardless of family history. P 300 waves were unaffected by sobriety length or drinking history. The results support the hypothesis that P 300 differences can be seen between <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> those at risk for alcoholism...|$|R

5|$|The various health {{problems}} associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries, motor vehicle accidents (due to drunk driving), domestic violence, and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>and</b> their family and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified {{the cost to the}} UK of all forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion. All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5 billion.|$|E
5|$|Moreno González {{was born}} in the ranchería of Guanajuatillo in Apatzingán, Michoacán, Mexico at around 5:00a.m. on 8 March 1970. There are few details of Moreno González's upbringing, but {{religion}} may have {{played an important role in}} his early life. His parents had 13 children (including Moreno González). His father Manuel Moreno was reportedly an <b>alcoholic</b> <b>and</b> had several mistresses, and one day he left his family when Moreno González was still very young, forcing his mother to singlehandedly raise the whole family. With their father gone, Moreno González and his siblings lived under the strict discipline of their mother. According to his autobiography, Moreno González had a love-hate relationship with his mother; as a child, he was beaten by his mother for being troublesome and getting into fights. In one occasion, he recalled that his mother once forced him to make his way back to his house by walking on his knees while keeping his arms stretched like a cross throughout the whole day for stealing an animal. Such treatments helped him develop resentment as to partially explain his violent behavior as an adult, he argued. He admitted, however, that he often got into fist fights with other kids from Guanajuatillo and the surrounding rancherías. Moreno González recalled that he would not always win and that he once got into 10 fights in a single day. His violent reputation as a child helped him earn the nickname El Más Loco ("The Craziest One")—which he held onto for the rest of his life—among his siblings and other kids from the area where he grew up.|$|E
40|$|Two of {{the three}} class I alcohol {{dehydrogenase}} (ADH) genes (ADH 2 and ADH 3) encode known functional variants that act on alcohol with different efficiencies. Variants at both these genes have been implicated in alcoholism in some populations because allele frequencies differ between <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> controls. Specifically, controls have higher frequencies of the variants with higher Vmax (ADH 2 * 2 and ADH 3 * 1). In samples both of <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> of controls from three Taiwanese populations (Chinese, Ami, and Atayal) we found significant pairwise disequilibrium for all comparisons of the two functional polymorphisms and a third, presumably neutral, intronic polymorphism in ADH 2. The class I ADH genes all lie within 80 kb on chromosome 4; thus, variants are not inherited independently, and haplotypes must be analyzed when evaluating the risk of alcoholism. In the Taiwanese Chinese we found that, only among those chromosomes containing the ADH 3 * 1 variant (high Vmax), the proportions of chromosomes with ADH 2 * 1 (low Vmax) and those with ADH 2 * 2 (high Vmax) are significantly different between <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> controls (P< 10 - 5). The proportions of chromosomes with ADH 3 * 1 and those with ADH 3 * 2 are not significantly different between <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> controls, on a constant ADH 2 background (with ADH 2 * 1, P=. 83; with ADH 2 * 2, P=. 53). Thus, the observed differences {{in the frequency of}} the functional polymorphism at ADH 3, between <b>alcoholics</b> <b>and</b> controls, can be accounted for by the disequilibrium with ADH 2 in this population...|$|R
