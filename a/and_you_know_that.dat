500|$|Kove {{originally}} {{wanted to}} make the film biographical, based on a story her father told her: he had dreamed of being an artist, and made an appointment with an art teacher to ask if he was good enough {{to make it in the}} art world. However, he stood at the top of the stairs and decided not to go, eventually deciding to go to architecture school (as his parents wanted) where he met his wife. Kove's inspiration was drawn from the fact that her existence seemed to hinge on that decision, because [...] "if the artist had said, 'Oh, you must paint,' you know, then in all likelihood he would never have met my mother, <b>and,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> would have been it for my chances." [...] However, Kove felt the story was too personal, and rewrote it to be fictional.|$|E

500|$|Later {{that year}} Cros led his brigade, {{as part of}} the 1st Moroccan Infantry Division, at the Second Battle of Artois - an allied attempt to capture Vimy Ridge with an assault on a [...] wide stretch of the front. [...] Cros took {{particular}} care to inspire a keen esprit de corps in his men and {{on the eve of the}} attack told them: [...] "I am your father <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I love you as my children, if you want to show me that you love me in return, fight and kill lots of Boche". [...] At 10 AM on 9 May 1915 Cros' brigade advanced in conjunction with the division's 1st Brigade, a French Foreign Legion unit led by Colonel Pein. [...] The five-hour preliminary bombardment was largely ineffective and the division took heavy casualties in reaching the German lines, [...] distant. [...] However they managed to push the Germans out and some units even reached the villages of Vimy and Givenchy-en-Gohelle. [...] The next morning, hit by their own artillery and under German counter-attack, the French were forced to withdraw to their own lines in the course of which Cros was killed. [...] Cros was one of almost 2,000 men of the Moroccan division killed in that action, as was fellow brigade commander Colonel Pein.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Rediff.com rated the album 4.5 out of 5, labelled it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and wrote, [...] "Bhardwaj has delivered a soundtrack that is lethally explosive. Not that we expected anything less. And trust Gulzar to artfully craft {{a really long}} fuse for the Kaminey bomb, making sure the tracks stay afire long before and after they actually go boom." [...] Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama gave a rating 4 out 5 and wrote, [...] "Kaminey is certainly not a run of the mill album {{and this is where}} its prime strength lies. The album boasts of at least three chartbuster tracks'Dhan Te Nan' (sure shot superhit), 'Thode Bheege' (must for the hearts in love) and 'Raat Ke Dhai Baje' (for some 'masti' and 'hungama'). Songs like 'Fatak' and 'Kaminey' are innovative and situational which showcase the range of Vishal Bhardwaj. Add to that the 'Go Charlie Go– Theme Music' <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Kaminey is yet another addition to some excellent albums that have hit the stands during last one month." [...] Planet Bollywood rated the album 8.5 out of 10 and said it is the best soundtrack released that year, and that [...] "t has experimentations with both music and lyrics". Indo-Asian News Service praised the soundtrack and said that [...] "..."Kaminey" [...] is easily among 2009's finest scores. Experimental in its sound, yet very mainstream in appeal. Vishal Bhardwaj has proved his mettle yet again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sothern's {{next great}} role was the title role, Fitzaltamont, in a hit revival of Byron's The Crushed Tragedian (1878, {{originally}} named The Prompter's Box) at the Haymarket. [...] The Era admired [...] "the sepulchral tones, the glaring eyeballs, the long hair, the wonderful 'stage walk', the melodramatic attitudes" [...] of his portrayal. [...] He next appeared in The Hornet's Nest by Byron at the Haymarket. [...] The Crushed Tragedian {{was not a}} great success in London, but it became a hit in New York. [...] The Philadelphia Inquirer raved, [...] "With what elaboration of detail does the actor embody his conception! There is not a gesture, not an intonation, not a movement, but seems to illustrate the character portrayed. He strides across the stage and {{it is as though}} he were wading through a sea of gore; he mutters to himself ‘Ha! ha!’ <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he is cursing fate with a bitterness loud and deep. always and in all things poor Altamont is exquisitely, indescribably ludicrous."

Hallows opined that Pickard is [...] "probably the person I've cried at the most, some of the more difficult stories he's done, even though you know the story that's coming up, you can't help but have a lump in your throat". Another series producer Bryan Kirkwood praised Pickard's acting skills, stating that he felt Pickard is a [...] "brilliant" [...] actor. He said he was [...] "particularly pleased in moving Tony away from the buffoon he had become over the years into heartbreaking stories such Grace's death and his relationship with Jacqui. He's a touching and sensitive actor who's always over-looked". Series producer Paul Marquess praised Pickard, saying he felt that [...] "there's only so many daft Tony stories you can do. He's so key to the show and so able and adept". Pickard's colleague Gemma Merna praised Pickard saying Pickard has [...] "had some great storylines", adding that if she was [...] "half as successful as Nick is on the show and liked as much then I would love to stay".|$|E
