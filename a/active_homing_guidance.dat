50|$|The maneuverable {{reentry vehicle}} (abbreviated MARV or MaRV) {{is a type}} of {{ballistic}} missile whose warhead is capable of autonomous tracking ground targets. It often requires some terminal <b>active</b> <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> (like Pershing II active radar homing) to make sure the missile does not miss the target, because of the frequent trajectory shifts. Refer to atmospheric reentry.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{production}} of the newly built Yu-1 torpedoes has stopped long time ago, production continues in the form of upgrading the existing Yu-1 torpedoes in Chinese inventory, which numbered near 10,000. Yu-1 torpedoes have been modified in various stages, including incorporating ASW capability, so that the torpedo could no longer only be used for ASuW, but instead, can be used for both ASuW and ASW warfare. Another important modification was to incorporate Yu-1 torpedo as part of the CAPTOR mine type mine system. Upgrades with newer electronics had also been done. Incorporating <b>active</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> was another upgrade.|$|R
50|$|In flight tests, the Kipper cruised on its {{approach}} to a target {{at an altitude of}} about 10,000 meters, using inertial guidance until it reaches a range of about 100 to 110 kilometers from the target, where it enters a shallow 15 degree dive, commanded by a mid-course update via radio link. When it reaches a range of 60 to 70 kilometers it levels out at an altitude of between 800 and 1,000 meters where it cruises until it reaches a range of 10 to 16 kilometers, when the missile's <b>active</b> radar <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> is engaged. It then enters a dive, striking the target vessel close to or below the waterline.|$|R
50|$|Yu-4 (鱼-4) torpedo is the Chinese {{development}} of the Russian SAET-50 ASuW passive acoustic homing torpedo, {{and it is the}} Russian SAET-50 torpedo incorporating <b>active</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> <b>guidance.</b> Yu-4 torpedo is often erroneously claimed by many sources as the Chinese version of the SAET-60 acoustic homing torpedo, but Soviets had not completed the {{development of}} SAET-60 and only fielded the weapon in 1961, by then the relationship between former-Soviet Union and China had already worsened and China had not received any technical assistance on SAET-60 torpedo. The background of the development of Yu-4 torpedo is identical to that of Yu-1 torpedo and Yu-2 torpedo.|$|R
50|$|The {{progress}} {{made in the}} development of the Yu-3 torpedo had encouraged the Chinese to resume the development of the Yu-4 torpedo after several years of dormancy which begun in the early 1960s. At the end of 1971, 5 samples were produced based on the experience gained {{in the development of}} the Yu-3 torpedo. However, the speed was low and other results were not satisfactory either. The Chinese researchers decided to take a prudent approach by developing two different versions, one with passive acoustic <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> and the other with combined passive / <b>active</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> <b>guidance.</b> The one with passive acoustic homing begun its development in the mid-1960s and was named as Yu-4 Jia (鱼-4甲), or sometimes as Yu-4A, while the combined active / passive acoustic homing version begun its development in the late-1960s and named as Yu-4 Yi (鱼-4乙) or sometimes as Yu-4B. Yu-4A was designed by the East Wind Instrumentation Factory (东风仪表厂) in Xi'an, while Y-4B was designed jointly by Northwestern Polytechnical University (primary contractor) and Pinyang Machinery Factory (平阳机械厂) in Houma, Shanxi. Pinyang Machinery Factory (平阳机械厂) was tasked with manufacturing both Yu-4A and Y-4B.|$|R
50|$|Bombe Guidée Laser (BGL) laser-guided {{bombs were}} {{developed}} by Matra (now MBDA) starting in 1978. The guidance system had to work using the same principles as the US Paveway guided bombs. The guidance kits were intended as modifications to existing free fall bombs that were in service with the French Air Force. The semi <b>active</b> laser <b>homing</b> (SALH) <b>guidance</b> system was developed starting from the AS-30 laser-guided missile sensor. The guidance system allowed for in-flight target illumination by the aircraft-mounted ATLIS 2 (Automatic Tracking Laser Illumination System) or with ground-based laser designator targeting pod.|$|R
50|$|Built by Chelomei/NPO Mashinostroenia, the bulging 10 m missile has swept-back {{wings and}} tail, weighs around 7,000 {{kilograms}} {{and can be}} fitted with either a 750 kg HE warhead, a FAE warhead, or a 500 kt nuclear warhead. A stubby cylindrical solid-fuel rocket is fitted to the rear for launch; this booster stage is released when the missile enters sustained flight. For many years {{it was believed that}} this missile used a turbojet engine during the sustained flight; after the Russian and the Western media gained access to its performance characteristics, it was understood that its propulsion system was a ramjet. The P-700 has a distinctive annular air intake in the nose. Maximum speed is believed to be between Mach 1.6 and more than Mach 2.5. Range estimates vary between 400 km to 500 km to 550-625 km. The guidance system is mixed-mode, with inertial <b>guidance,</b> terminal <b>active</b> radar <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> and also anti-radar homing. Mid-course correction is probable.|$|R

40|$|This brief {{introduces}} a new design methodology for impact angle control guidance (IACG) laws. The proposed methodology can extend any proven <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> laws to their impact angle control versions if the {{expressions of the}} estimated terminal flight path angles under those guidance laws are given. The time derivatives of the estimated terminal flight path angles are obtained as functions of the guidance commands. The IACG versions of the <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> laws are derived from those functions and the desired error dynamics of the estimated terminal flight path angle. The guidance law of each IACG version has two terms: the first term maintains the characteristics and capturability of the original guidance law and the second term drives the estimated terminal flight path angle to converge to the specified flight path angle. When a well-understood <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> law for a certain combination of target and missile models is given, an IACG law for that combination is easily derived without reformulating the guidance problem again. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated by several examples, deriving new IACG laws for various target and missile models...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} planar <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> for a vehicle traveling to a beacon with unknown location and using a measurement of binary range-rate. The funda-mental nature of binary range-rate is studied, and a guidance law requiring only this measurement is presented. Another guidance law utilizing both binary range-rate and heading angle is also presented, and stability is addressed. This guidance law consists of separated control and observation, {{and it does not}} require finding the closest points of approach for multiple headings. This guidance law’s response to measurement corrup-tion and observer gain is studied. Characteristics of good initial estimates are given, and an exploration method is presented that provides good initial estimates and leads to improved response. This approach provides a method of low-cost, autonomous <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> that utilizes a single, omnidirectional receiver to guide a vehicle to a single, omnidirectional transmitting beacon.
