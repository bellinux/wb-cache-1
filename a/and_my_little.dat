500|$|Before the brony fandom arose, Hasbro had {{introduced}} new My Little Pony toys, including convention-exclusives, at the San Diego Comic Con International. With a brony element in attendance, the convention-exclusive toys have reflected the brony culture; a large poster {{was published in}} 2011 that included several background characters that had attracted the fandom's interest. A pony toy named [...] "Derpy" [...] was made available for both the convention <b>and</b> <b>My</b> <b>Little</b> Pony Fair in 2012. Toys [...] "R" [...] Us provided early, limited numbers of new toy based on the zebra character Zecora, due for release in late 2012 by Hasbro. Both Zecora and [...] "Derpy" [...] toys sold out within {{the first day of}} the convention. In 2014, Shapeways announced an association with Hasbro to create 3D printed versions of Friendship Is Magic characters, with fan artists creating and selling their designs under Hasbro's license and approval. Shapeways had previously published fan-financed and -created models without Hasbro's license before being asked to cease and desist such practice; the new approach with Hasbro's blessing has been seen as helping to break down the walls between content and fans in the age of social media.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the first season, one of the show's animators confirmed that [...] "Derpy" [...] would be a scripted background character in the second season, and was a part of several sight gags. In the original broadcast of the mid-season episode [...] "The Last Roundup" [...] {{as well as on the}} home media The Friendship Express release, [...] "Derpy" [...] was called out by name by Rainbow Dash, and given lines (as voiced by St. Germain) and klutzy mannerisms as a direct call-out to the brony fandom. Though most of the fans appreciated the inclusion, some viewers had a negative response to the character, believing her portrayal insulted the mentally handicapped. Hasbro subsequently modified these scenes, and while [...] "Derpy" [...] is still present in subsequent broadcast and digital versions of the episode, she is not named, and a different voice is used. According to Hasbro's Nicole Agnello, [...] "Some viewers felt that aspects of the episode 'The Last Roundup' did not stay true to the core message of friendship which is the heart and soul of the series. Hasbro Studios decided to make slight audio alterations to this single episode." [...] Despite Hasbro's intentions, some members of the brony community were disappointed, and some made efforts to restore the original voice. [...] "Derpy" [...] remained in background cameos throughout other episodes in season 2 and 3. Within season 4, Derpy was re-introduced, remaining silent and unnamed but with her original wall-eyed look, as a side character in the main story of [...] "Rainbow Falls". The appearance was planned as a big reveal for the brony fans, according to co-director Jim Miller, and that [...] "she is here to stay" [...] according to Hasbro's vice president for entertainment Mike Vogel. The Derpy character is used often on Hasbro's marketing of the show. For example, Hasbro's exclusive pony toy at the Comic-Con International <b>and</b> <b>My</b> <b>Little</b> Pony Fair in 2012 was based on [...] "Derpy", and has the same cross-eye look.|$|E

2500|$|Pickett {{was born}} March 18, 1941 in Prattville, Alabama, and sang in Baptist church choirs. He {{was the fourth}} of 11 {{children}} and called his mother [...] "the baddest woman in my book," [...] telling historian Gerri Hirshey: [...] "I get scared of her now. She used to hit me with anything, skillets, stove wood — (one time I ran away) and cried for a week. Stayed in the woods, me <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>little</b> dog." [...] Pickett eventually left {{to live with his}} father in Detroit in 1955.|$|E
2500|$|Helene {{noted in}} her book that she exposed herself and her family to great danger by {{assisting}} the queen in her efforts to obtain the crown. In an atmosphere of political intrigue, where death was a common punishment for many crimes, Helene apparently had reservations concerning the advisibility of the queen's request: [...] "The queen's request frightened me, for it meant great danger for me <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>little</b> children." [...] In her writing she describes how she prayed for success and promised to make a barefoot pilgrimage to Zell. At least two assistants accompanied Helene, who did the breaking in while Helene kept watch. After they got the crown without attracting attention, they locked the doors again and fixed the queen's seal.|$|E
2500|$|When Lori was {{six years}} old, her mother took her to an agent who {{specialized}} in child actors. She thought that acting might be a healthy outlet for Lori. When later asked what inspired her to be an actress, Martin said, [...] "The best {{time in my life}} was when I was about four. Doree and I had to go live with my aunt in Ponca City, Oklahoma. My mother got sick and Daddy had to go to work every day, so we couldn't stay here. I didn't want to come back. I cried and cried. That was when I decided, if I had to come back, I'd be an actress. I started getting parts immediately <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>little</b> brother was signed by the same agent, but he lacked my interest in acting. I just loved it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{episode was}} first teased by Hasbro Vice President of Development Mike Vogel during a panel at San Diego Comic Con International in July 2013, where he hinted about a musical season 4 episode where [...] "somebody will give [...] {{a run for}} her partying money." [...] The {{involvement}} of [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic in the episode stemmed from a Twitter post by the parody musician, where he had linked to a user-created music video with scenes from Friendship Is Magic episodes set to [...] "Polkarama!", one of his polka medleys. The tweet was discovered by co-executive producer Jayson Thiessen, who posted a reply asking the musician {{if he would be}} interested in the idea of guest voicing a character on the show since [...] "Weird Al <b>and</b> <b>My</b> <b>Little</b> Pony seem to go together really well." [...] After being met with a positive response from [...] of the series, Thiessen received a private message from Weird Al about a year later, expressing his interest in participating. In the episode, Weird Al voiced a character named Cheese Sandwich, who is portrayed as being a rival to [...] in the realm of party service.|$|E
