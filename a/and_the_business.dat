5|$|Although the Nazis won the {{greatest}} {{share of the}} popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, they did not have a majority and therefore Hitler led a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and the German National People's Party. Under pressure from politicians, industrialists <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> community, President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933. This event is known as the Machtergreifung ("seizure of power"). In the following months, the NSDAP used a process termed Gleichschaltung ("co-ordination") to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of the party. All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members. By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the NSDAP were the army and the churches.|$|E

5|$|As {{the freeways}} in the Lansing area were {{completed}} in the 1960s through the 1980s, the highways through downtown changed designations. The section of I-96 west of Lansing opened in December 1962. In 1973, M-78 was converted to a freeway near the Flint area, and from Olivet southwest of Lansing to the new freeway, the old highway was redesignated Temporary I-69 (Temp. I-69). Additional segments of I-69 north of Lansing were finished in 1984 and 1987.

5|$|In 1919 {{when the}} state highway system was first {{numbered}}, the east–west highway running through Clare was numbered M-20, and it was renumbered to US10 seven years later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created. In late 1961, the US10 freeway east {{of the city to}} Midland was finished, but the route through downtown remained part of US10. A freeway bypass north of Clare and Farwell opened in 1975, and US10 was rerouted along the then-US27 freeway to connect from the new bypass to the existing freeway east of the city, bypassing both cities. The section of US 10 in downtown Clare was designated Bus. US 10 at this time, running along then-Bus. US27 to connect to US27/US10 north of downtown. The section of former US10 between Farwell and Clare became an extended M-115 in 1989.
