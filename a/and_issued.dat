40|$|AbstractBased on an {{empirical}} study including 3 companies, the paper addresses, problems <b>and</b> <b>issues</b> {{that have been}} encountered when introducing, and later using, Functional Products in production systems. The purpose of a Functional Product {{is to provide a}} function to customers with a specified or agreed-upon level of availability or productivity. Both operational and management-level problems <b>and</b> <b>issues</b> have been investigated. The study focuses on the customer side, involving both manufacturing and process industry companies. A set of problems <b>and</b> <b>issues</b> has been identified. The problems <b>and</b> <b>issues</b> found during the literature review have been largely corroborated, and the new problems <b>and</b> <b>issues</b> found are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The {{interlinking}} of commit <b>and</b> <b>issue</b> {{data has}} become a de-facto standard in software development. Modern issue tracking systems, such as JIRA, automatically interlink commits <b>and</b> <b>issues</b> by the extraction of identifiers (e. g., issue key) from commit messages. However, the conventions {{for the use of}} interlinking methodologies vary between software projects. For example, some projects enforce the use of identifiers for every commit while others have less restrictive conventions. In this work, we introduce a model called PaLiMod to enable the analysis of interlinking characteristics in commit <b>and</b> <b>issue</b> data. We surveyed 15 Apache projects to investigate differences and commonalities between linked and non-linked commits <b>and</b> <b>issues.</b> Based on the gathered information, we created a set of heuristics to interlink the residual of non-linked commits <b>and</b> <b>issues.</b> We present the characteristics of Loners and Phantoms in commit <b>and</b> <b>issue</b> data. The results of our evaluation indicate that the proposed PaLiMod model and heuristics enable an automatic interlinking and can indeed reduce the residual of non-linked commits <b>and</b> <b>issues</b> in software projects...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores trends <b>and</b> <b>issues</b> {{in outdoor}} <b>and</b> adventure-based {{programming}} in the United States. Many of the trends <b>and</b> <b>issues</b> hold valuable lessons for practitioners and scholars worldwide. The trends <b>and</b> <b>issues</b> included were gathered through interviews with {{a panel of}} professionals, checked throughout multiple regional, national and international conferences {{over a two-year period}} and supported from the literature. The specific trends <b>and</b> <b>issues</b> discussed are: a) cultural diversity and changing demographics; b) nature-deficit disorder; c) older adult participation; d) public land access; e) professionalization of outdoor leaders, and f) program outcome accountability through evidence-based research...|$|R
5|$|At {{the height}} of the program, over 350 people were {{involved}} in the rescue of Jews. Sister Sára Salkaházi was caught sheltering Jewish women and was killed by members of the Arrow Cross Party. Swiss diplomat Carl Lutz also issued protective passports from the Swiss embassy in the spring of 1944; and Italian businessman Giorgio Perlasca posed as a Spanish diplomat <b>and</b> <b>issued</b> forged visas. Portuguese diplomats Sampaio Garrido and Carlos de Liz-Texeira Branquinho rented houses and apartments to shelter and protect refugees from deportation and murder <b>and</b> <b>issued</b> safe conducts to approximately 1,000 Hungarian Jews. Berber Smit (Barbara Hogg), the daughter of Lolle Smit (1892–1961), director of N.V. Philips Budapest and a Dutch spy working for the British MI6, also assisted Wallenberg, and later claimed to have been his girlfriend, as did her son. However, she was temporarily engaged to Wallenberg's colleague Lars Berg, and later married a Scottish officer; it has not dispelled claims that Wallenberg was homosexual.|$|E
