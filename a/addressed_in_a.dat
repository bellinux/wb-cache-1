5|$|The biography, Lindbergh, {{was highly}} anticipated; {{prior to its}} publication, the book's film rights were bought, sight unseen, by Steven Spielberg, who planned to direct a movie of it. Published in 1998, Lindbergh sold about 250,000 copies in hardcover, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. Berg was noted for his {{exhaustive}} research, {{as well as his}} sympathetic, but by no means uncritical, approach to Lindbergh, whose alleged anti-Semitism he <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> straightforward, unblinking manner.|$|E
5|$|Other {{issues with}} regards to crashes, {{temporary}} freezes and long load times were found on single core computers, but these were ultimately <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> patch. A second patch, which reduced the amount mining time required to acquire upgrades, fixed some saved game loading issues, and addressed other minor bugs, was also released. On PlayStation 3, a concerning number of players reported that their save files can become corrupted if the game crashes unexpectedly. After community chief Chris Priestly of BioWare asked affected players to provide details about the issue, BioWare released a PlayStation 3 patch designed to combat save bugs and crashes experienced.|$|E

The group contains Abbottella haitensis, and Abbottella moreletianus. Bartsch (1946) broke Abbottella moreletianus into five subspecies.

Hadrosaurid {{systematics}} were <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 1942 monograph by Richard Swann Lull and Nelda Wright. They proposed the genus Anatosaurus for several species of dubious genera. Cope's famous mount at the AMNH became Anatosaurus copei. In 1990, Anatosaurus was moved to Edmontosaurus. One former Anatosaurus species was distinct enough from Edmontosaurus {{to be placed in}} a separate genus, named Anatotitan, so in 1990, the AMNH mount was relabelled Anatotitan copei.|$|E
25|$|Seasonal {{differences}} in sora habitat use have been reported. In northeastern Missouri in spring, {{the likelihood of}} detecting sora in robust emergents, such as cattail (Typha spp.) and longroot smartweed (Polygonum amphibium var. emersum), was over 6 times that of detecting soras in these areas in fall. However, availability of habitats during various {{times of the year}} was not <b>addressed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> study performed in southeastern Missouri, plant species used by sora during spring and fall migration differed significantly (p=0.005). However, the author qualifies this finding with his observation of major seasonal {{differences in}} vegetation availability.|$|E

25|$|Although the species, {{including}} {{many of its}} synonyms, has been placed in the genus Alepes for some time, {{the nature of its}} teeth has made this placement controversial. Two authors have argued that the species should be reassigned to a new monotypic genus due to it having short conical teeth in comparison to the rest of Alepes comblike teeth. This problem was <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> molecular phylogenetic study of the Carangidae in which A. kleinii and A. djedaba (Shrimp scad) were included. The results confirmed the placement of A. kleinii in Alepes, with the authors arguing the two species were too closely related to warrant placement in a new genus.|$|E
25|$|The {{policies}} shared between San Diego and Tijuana are <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> binational way as {{the effects}} of actions {{on one side of}} the border, with regard to infrastructure, are felt on the neighboring side. In the past decade San Diego–Tijuana has developed new cooperative strategies to make energy consumption more efficient and effectively supply energy. In 2000 Sempra Energy constructed a natural gas pipeline to provide energy to a thermal power plant in Rosarito; also the principle plant in Baja California. The region was able to reduce levels of air pollution substantially when the conversion to a natural gas fired electrical generation facility was completed. In the Baja California subregions, unleaded gasoline has also replaced leaded fuel as means for transportation, helping regional air quality. The new strategies also included plans that worked with the nearby capital of Mexicali, where the pipeline shared between the two states was constructed to supply natural gas to its metropolitan area with energy supplied by Sempra and Proxima. Sempra Energy has been applauded for its initial development of this cross-border infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|The {{residents}} and staff together took {{responsibility for the}} daily maintenance {{of the community and}} all contributed to cooking and cleaning. The young people were considered to be partners in the therapeutic endeavour and there was an expectation that everyone attended the daily community meetings. These meetings were the heart of the community and often young people were able to share and resolve very painful experiences from their past, and the daily difficulties and challenges of sixty adults and children living together could be <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> helpful way. There were high expectations on young people to help each other and to achieve educationally. Many young people left to go to university and others took up higher education at a later point in their adult lives. Unfortunately a big fire broke out in 1990 and the building was uninsured. Residential care for children has also fallen out of favour as a result of abuse scandals and Peper Harow was sold and redeveloped into flats. It still has an influence today. In particular Rose's understanding {{of the importance of the}} physical and sensory environment in healing traumatised young people was decades ahead of his time.|$|E

25|$|Chemotherapy {{also has}} a role, {{combined}} with radiation, in the postoperative setting (adjuvant therapy). Generally it is used where the pathology of the resected specimen indicates features associated with high risk of locoregional recurrence (e.g. extracapsular extension through involved lymph nodes or very close margins). It has shown improved disease-free survival and locoregional control in two very similar clinical trials in such high risk patients, EORTC 22931 (1994–2000) and RTOG 9501 (1995–2000). However, for HPV+OPC patients, such extracapsular spread {{does not appear to}} be an adverse factor and the addition of chemotherapy to radiation in this group provided no further advantage. Since the sample size to detect a survival advantage is large, given the small number of events in this group, these studies may have been underpowered and the question of the utility of adding chemotherapy is being <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> randomized clinical trial (ADEPT) with two year locoregional control and disease free survival as the endpoint. The addition of chemotherapy to radiation increases acute and late toxicity. In the GORTEC trial, chemotherapy with docetaxel provided improved survival and locoregional control in locally advanced OPC, but was associated with increased mucositis and need for feeding by gastrostomy. Chemotherapy and radiation are associated with a risk of death of 3–4% in this context. It is unclear whether the added toxicity of adding chemotherapy to radiation is offset by significant clinical benefit in disease control and survival.|$|E

Replays showed that Hull's skate was within the crease when he scored; however, the NHL ruled that he had possession of the puck prior to entering the crease, making the goal legal. [...] League officials stated that that very scenario was <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> memo sent to the league's on-ice officials {{prior to the start of}} the playoffs. Hull himself states the goal was legal, supporting the claim that the NHL had altered the rules in a private memo sent to all teams but not released to the public. Media, fans and players across the league remain divided on the goal, some claiming that the league altered the rule after the fact. It remains especially controversial in Buffalo, where fans and former players continue to maintain that the play should have been ruled [...] "no goal". The NHL formally abolished the crease rule prior to the next season, allowing players to score from within the crease freely as long as they did not interfere with the goaltender.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} changes were made to {{aircraft}} before Pe-3bis production resumed in April 1942 and combat-use revealed several additional problems {{that had to be}} <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> second Pe-3bis prototype, which began its State acceptance tests in May 1942. Reloading the nose guns proved to be time-consuming, taking up to 45minutes, and the night-firing of the port-side UBK continued to blind the pilot. These problems prompted the transfer of both UBK guns to the wing center section where they were installed in a compartment that was hinged at the front to drop down and allow easier access to the guns and their ammunition. The starboard gun was given 230rounds and the port gun had 265rounds. This change reduced the capacity of the Nr. 7fuel tank by , but an asbestos bulkhead was added to protect the tank from heat generated by the guns. The changes meant that the cartridge cases from the ShVAK cannon could not be collected, making the skin and lower fuselage vulnerable. These were reinforced with steel sheets to minimize the damage inflicted by the large-caliber cases. The original mounting for the dorsal UBT machine gun provided an excellent field of fire, but lack of aerodynamic balance prevented the gunner/navigator to use its full range. Pressure exerted by the airstream prevented the gunner from traversing more than about 40–50° from the centerline. A twin-petal compensator proved mostly ineffective. The crash pylon was removed to give the gunner more working space. The ammunition box of the UBT was too small, only 30rounds, and took about a minute to reload. The boxes were deleted and the UBT was given a 200-round belt with an electric drive to help to prevent feed problems. An anti-icing system was added for the propellers and the pilot's windscreen. The nose glazing was replaced entirely and the crew's armor was increased to a total weight of [...] These changes moved the aircraft's center of gravity forward and the landing gear struts were lengthened, moving the wheels [...] forward, which helped to reduce the chance of the aircraft tipping over.|$|E
