5|$|The next day, after final checks were completed, the {{expended}} LM <b>ascent</b> <b>stage</b> was jettisoned. Because of {{a failure}} by {{the crew to}} activate a certain switch in the LM before sealing it off, it initially tumbled after separation and did not execute the rocket burn necessary for the craft's intentional de-orbit. The <b>ascent</b> <b>stage</b> eventually crashed into the lunar surface nearly {{a year after the}} mission. The crew's next task, after jettisoning the Lunar Module <b>ascent</b> <b>stage,</b> was to release a subsatellite into lunar orbit from the CSM's Scientific Instrument Bay. The burn to alter the CSM's orbit to that desired for the subsatellite had been cancelled; as a result, the subsatellite lasted half of its anticipated lifetime. Just under five hours later, on the CSM's 65th orbit around the Moon, its Service Propulsion System main engine was reignited to propel the craft on a trajectory that would return it to Earth. The SPS engine performed the burn flawlessly despite the malfunction that had delayed the lunar landing several days before.|$|E
5|$|After {{about seven}} hours of rest, {{the crew was}} awakened by Houston {{to prepare for the}} return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in Eagle <b>ascent</b> <b>stage</b> to rejoin Collins aboard Columbia in lunar orbit.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{beyond the}} manned lunar landings, NASA {{investigated}} several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware. The Apollo Extension Series (Apollo X,) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using {{the space in}} the Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop {{to be built in}} orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage, and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by the Apollo Telescope Mount, which could be attached to the <b>ascent</b> <b>stage</b> of the lunar module via a rack. The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a Venus fly-by mission.|$|E

5|$|As another active seismic experiment, the jettisoned LM <b>ascent</b> <b>stages</b> on Apollo 12 {{and later}} {{missions}} were deliberately crashed on the Moon at known locations. The only {{exceptions to this}} were the Apollo 13 LM which burned up in the Earth's atmosphere, and Apollo 16, where a loss of attitude control after jettison prevented making a targeted impact.|$|R
50|$|On the Lunar Module, {{the fuel}} and {{oxidizer}} tanks were enlarged {{on both the}} descent and <b>ascent</b> <b>stages</b> and the engine bell on the descent stage was extended. Batteries and solar cells were added for increased electrical power. In all this increased {{the weight of the}} Lunar Module to 36000 lb, 4000 lb heavier than previous models.|$|R
5|$|Another {{proposed}} spacecraft, the Gemini Lunar Surface Survival Shelter, {{was designed}} to be sent to the Moon ahead of an Apollo mission. It would have landed close to the planned Apollo landing site, and if the Apollo Lunar Module's <b>ascent</b> <b>stage</b> failed to ignite, the crew would have performed an EVA to transfer to the LSSS. The shelter was not designed to take off again after landing, so an LSRS or another Apollo mission would then be sent to collect the crew, whilst the Command Module Pilot of the original Apollo mission would have returned to Earth alone aboard his spacecraft. It consisted of a Gemini Reentry Module, which would have housed the astronauts whilst they awaited rescue, and a descent stage containing life support systems, consumables, and the engine and propellant used to land the spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The Lunar Module (LM) was {{designed}} to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module. Not designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere or return to Earth, its fuselage {{was designed}} totally without aerodynamic considerations, and was of an extremely lightweight construction. It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages, {{each with its own}} engine. The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant, surface stay consumables, and surface exploration equipment. The <b>ascent</b> <b>stage</b> contained the crew cabin, ascent propellant, and a reaction control system. The initial LM model weighed approximately , and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours. An Extended Lunar Module weighed over , and allowed surface stays of over 3 days. The contract for design and construction of the Lunar Module was awarded to Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, and the project was overseen by Thomas J. Kelly.|$|E

The important in-flight inequality constraints required to maintain the integrity of the vehicle are considered.

Along with the two flat stages and the two time trials were three hilly stages. While there were no exceptionally high passes visited in the race, each of the hilly stages was long and featured several small, steep <b>ascents.</b> <b>Stages</b> 4 and 5 were both [...] in length, which is long for stages in a multi-day race.

25|$|Like its predecessor, the Altair design {{consists}} of two parts: an <b>ascent</b> <b>stage</b> which houses the four-person crew; and a descent stage consisting of the landing gear, and storage {{for the majority of}} the crew's consumables (oxygen and water) and for scientific equipment. Unlike the Lunar Module, Altair was designed to land in the lunar polar regions favored by NASA for future lunar base construction. Altair, like the Lunar Module, was not designed to be reusable, and the <b>ascent</b> <b>stage</b> would be discarded after use.|$|E

50|$|The Apollo 14 Passive Seismic Experiment (PSE) {{was placed}} on the lunar surface as part of the Apollo 14 ALSEP package. The PSE was {{designed}} to detect vibrations and tilting of the lunar surface and measure changes in gravity at the instrument location. The vibrations are due to internal seismic sources (moonquakes) and external (meteoroids and impacts from the spent S-IVB and LM <b>ascent</b> <b>stages).</b> The primary objective of the experiment was to use these data to determine the internal structure, physical state, and tectonic activity of the Moon.

25|$|The Altair descent {{stage was}} to be powered by four RL-10 rocket engines, which are also those used in the Centaur upper stage of the Atlas V rocket. Unlike the current RL-10 engines in use, these newer RL-10s were {{to have the ability}} to {{throttle}} down to as low as 10% rated thrust (the older specifications allow for 20%), thus allowing the use of Altair for both the lunar orbit insertion (LOI) and landing stages of lunar missions. The <b>ascent</b> <b>stage</b> was designed to be powered by a single engine, likely a hypergolic engine similar or identical to the main engine of the Orion CSM, which would use the descent stage as both a launchpad and a platform for future base construction. Alternately, there was a small possibility that the original plan of using LOX/CH4–fueled engines on board the Block II (lunar) Orion CSM and Altair <b>ascent</b> <b>stage</b> would have been adopted.|$|E

A window in LM-5 (Apollo 11's LM Eagle) shattered during its initial cabin pressurization test, designed to pressurize the cabin to 39 kilopascals (5.7pounds per square inch) above the external pressure. Both inner and outer windows and the acrylic glass cover of the right-hand window shattered when the pressure reached 35 kPa (5.1pounds per square inch).|$|E

5000|$|Liquid oxygen is {{a common}} {{cryogenic}} liquid oxidizer propellant for spacecraft rocket applications, usually in combination with liquid hydrogen, kerosene or methane. [...] Liquid oxygen is useful in this role because it creates a high specific impulse. It {{was used in the}} very first rocket applications like the V2 missile (under the name A-Stoff and Sauerstoff) and Redstone, R-7 Semyorka, Atlas boosters, and the <b>ascent</b> <b>stages</b> of the Apollo Saturn rockets. Liquid oxygen was also used in some early ICBMs, although more modern ICBMs do not use liquid oxygen because its cryogenic properties and need for regular replenishment to replace boiloff make it harder to maintain and launch quickly. Many modern rockets use liquid oxygen, including the main engines on the now-retired Space Shuttle.|$|R

25|$|Upon landing, {{the crew}} {{would put on}} their extravehicular {{activity}} (EVA) spacesuits and commence the first of five to seven lunar EVAs, collecting samples and deploying experiments. After completing their Lunar Sortie operations, the crew would then enter the Altair and fire the <b>ascent</b> <b>stage</b> engine to lift off from the surface, using the descent stage as a launchpad (and leaving it as a platform for future base construction). Upon entering orbit, the Altair would rendezvous and dock with the waiting Orion spacecraft, and the crew would then transfer, along with samples collected on the Moon, back to the Orion. After jettisoning the Altair, the crew would perform the Trans Earth Injection (TEI) burn for the return trip to Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} for blackout on ascent differs from hyperventilation induced hypocapnia expedited blackouts {{and does not}} necessarily follow hyperventilation. However, hyperventilation will exacerbate the risk {{and there is no}} clear line between them. Shallow water blackouts can happen in extremely shallow water, even on dry land following hyperventilation and apnoea but the effect becomes much more dangerous in the <b>ascent</b> <b>stage</b> of a deep freedive. There is considerable confusion surrounding the terms shallow and deep water blackout and they have been used to refer to different things, or be used interchangeably, in different water sports circles. For example, the term shallow water blackout has been used to describe blackout on ascent because the blackout usually occurs when the diver ascends to a shallow depth.|$|E

40|$|A Lunar Lander Preparatory Study (LLPS) was {{undertaken}} for NASA's Lunar Lander Pre-Project in 2006 {{to explore a}} wide breadth of conceptual lunar lander designs. Civil servant teams from nearly every NASA center responded with dozens of innovative designs that addressed one or more specific lander technical challenges. Although none of the conceptual lander designs sought to solve every technical design issue, each added significantly to the technical database available to the Lunar Lander Project Office as it began operations in 2007. As part of the LLPS, a first order analysis was performed to identify candidate power systems for the <b>ascent</b> and descent <b>stages</b> of the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM). A power profile by mission phase was established based on LSAM subsystem power requirements. Using this power profile, battery and fuel cell systems were modeled to determine overall mass and volume. Fuel cell systems were chosen for both the descent and <b>ascent</b> <b>stages</b> due to their low mass. While fuel cells looked promising based on these initial results, several areas have been identified for further investigation in subsequent studies, including the identification and incorporation of peak power requirements into the analysis, refinement of the fuel cell models to improve fidelity and incorporate ongoing technology developments, and broadening the study to include solar power...|$|R

500|$|Eight {{minutes before}} departing the lunar surface, CAPCOM James Irwin {{notified}} Young and Duke from Mission Control {{that they were}} go for liftoff. Two minutes before launch, they activated the [...] "Master Arm" [...] switch and then the [...] "Abort Stage" [...] button, after which they awaited ignition of Orion’s <b>ascent</b> <b>stage</b> engine. When the <b>ascent</b> <b>stage</b> ignited, small explosive charges severed the <b>ascent</b> <b>stage</b> from the descent stage and cables connecting the two were severed by a guillotine-like mechanism. Six minutes after liftoff, at a speed of about , Young and Duke reached lunar orbit. Young and Duke successfully rendezvoused and re-docked with Mattingly in the Command/Service Module. To minimize the transfer of lunar dust from the LM cabin into the CSM, Young and Duke cleaned the cabin before opening the hatch separating the two spacecraft. After opening the hatch and reuniting with Mattingly, the crew transferred the samples Young and Duke had collected on the surface into the CSM for transfer to Earth.

The location is uncertain because the Eagle <b>ascent</b> <b>stage</b> was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time.

40|$|Scattering in a high-Q medium {{has been}} the best {{hypothesis}} to date for explaining the observation of a long, reverberating train of waves in lunar seismographs.
