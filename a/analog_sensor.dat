40|$|Aquaculture {{processes}} {{usually take}} place in remote and harsh environments, therefore its monitoring and supervision are constrained by several factors. Taking that into account, this MSc Dissertation proposes a technical solution for a remote supervision system for aquaculture platforms, which uses a sensoring method developed at CIBIO/InBIO. The proposed solution contemplates two different levels. At an upper level, there is a Gateway, an embedded data collection and communication system, based on a BeagleBone Black, which handles an I 2 C based sensor network and a SIM 800 GSM module. At a lower level, the sensor network is constituted by several sensor nodes, which consist of small sized PCBs responsible for {{the connection between the}} <b>analog</b> <b>sensors</b> and the microcontrollers that sample the <b>analog</b> <b>sensors,</b> store the collected data, and transmit it via I 2 C whenever the Gateway requests a certain information...|$|R

50|$|OTP (one time programmable) {{memory is}} a special type of {{non-volatile}} memory (NVM) that permits data to be written to memory only once. Once the memory has been programmed, it retains its value upon loss of power (i.e., is non-volatile). OTP memory is used in applications where reliable and repeatable reading of data is required. Examples include boot code, encryption keys and configuration parameters for <b>analog,</b> <b>sensor</b> or display circuitry. OTP NVM is characterized, over other types of NVM like eFuse or EEPROM, by offering a low power, small area footprint memory structure. As such OTP finds application in products from microprocessors & display drivers to Power Management ICs (PMICs).|$|E
50|$|An ADC with {{intermediate}} FM stage first uses a voltage-to-frequency converter {{to convert}} the desired signal into an oscillating signal with a frequency proportional to the voltage of the desired signal, and then uses a frequency counter to convert that frequency into a digital count proportional to the desired signal voltage. Longer integration times allow for higher resolutions. Likewise, {{the speed of the}} converter can be improved by sacrificing resolution. The two parts of the ADC may be widely separated, with the frequency signal passed through an opto-isolator or transmitted wirelessly. Some such ADCs use sine wave or square wave frequency modulation; others use pulse-frequency modulation. Such ADCs were once the most popular way to show a digital display of the status of a remote <b>analog</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|CEC {{was unique}} in {{that almost all of}} its sensors and {{actuators}} were digital; instead of the usual analog throttle position, coolant temperature, intake temperature and manifold pressure sensors, it used a set of fixed pressure- and temperature-controlled switches (as well as a wide-open throttle switch on the carburetor) to control fuel mixture and ignition timing. The only <b>analog</b> <b>sensor</b> in the system was the oxygen sensor. In other respects, it was a typical [...] "feedback" [...] carburetor system of the early-1980s, using a stepper motor to control fuel mixture and a two-stage [...] "Sole-Vac" [...] (which used a solenoid for one stage, and a vacuum motor for the other) to control idle speed. The CEC also controlled ignition timing using information from the fuel-control section and an engine knock sensor on the intake manifold.|$|E

5000|$|Digital sensors {{have been}} {{developed}} to overcome the traditional disadvantages of analog sensors.Digital sensors are mainly used in water, waste water and industrial processes. They measure parameters such as pH, redox potential, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, ammonium, nitrate, SAC, turbidity. A digital sensor system also consists of the sensor itself, a cable, and a transmitter. The differences to <b>analog</b> <b>sensor</b> systems are: a) The sensor has an electronic chip. The measuring signal is directly converted into a digital signal inside the sensor. The data transmission through the cable is also digital. This digital data transmission is not sensitive to cable length, cable resistance or impedance, and is not influenced by electromagnetic noise. Standard cables can be used. b) The connection between sensor and cable can be [...] and done by inductive coupling. Humidity and related corrosion is no longer an issue. Alternative fibre optic cables may also be an option for long or electromagnetically hostile connections.c) The sensor can be calibrated apart from the system.|$|E
