5|$|Although {{conclusive}} evidence might be wanting either way for whether Hebrew Law allowed for impalement, or just hanging, the Neo-Assyrian method of impalement <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> carvings could, perhaps, equally {{easily be seen}} as a form of hanging upon a pole, rather than focusing upon the stake's actual penetration of the body.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{credits for}} tracks Young has {{appeared}} on, {{there are often}} multiple people who contribute to his songs (although often in hip hop many people are officially credited as a writer for a song, even the producer).|$|E
5|$|Blunt-Lytton {{documented}} her {{attempts in}} the early 20th century to re-breed the 18th-century type of King Charles Spaniel <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> portraits of King Charles II. She used the Toy Trawler Spaniel, a curly haired, mostly black, small to medium-sized spaniel, and cross-bred these dogs {{with a variety of}} other breeds, including Blenheim Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels, in unsuccessful attempts to reproduce the earlier style.|$|E

5|$|For the CGI {{compositions}} of the Vale of Arryn, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{establishing shot}} of the Eyrie and from the sky cells, the visual effects team used images and textures from the Greek rock formations of Meteora. Initially they had been considering the Zhangjiajie Mountains in China, but because the landscape base plates were being shot in Ireland, using Meteora was a better option.|$|E
5|$|Once Ganesha was {{accepted}} {{as one of the}} five principal deities of Brahmanism, some Brahmins chose Ganesha as their principal deity. They developed the Ganapatya tradition, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ganesha Purana and the Mudgala Purana.|$|E

5|$|Texas {{has made}} a strong mark on {{national}} and international pop culture. The state is strongly associated {{with the image of}} the cowboy shown in westerns and in country western music.

5|$|The {{fence that}} {{separates}} the park from the city runs along a highway leaving the airport, this is one fact many Kenyans are proud of – this park is the only natural safari park that has a city scape background {{that can be seen}} from almost any part of the park, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> picture below of the giraffe and the sky scrapers.|$|E
5|$|The film shows Luttrell (Wahlberg) {{being able}} to walk after the Taliban's ambush on the four-man SEAL team. In reality, Luttrell {{explained}} that his legs were numb immediately after the ambush, and when feeling did return to them, the pain from the shrapnel in his legs made it too painful to walk; he had to crawl seven miles looking for water and sanctuary. Luttrell {{also said that he}} did not witness the MH-47 Chinook helicopter being shot down, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. At the end of the film, the Pashtun villagers fight off a Taliban attack in a firefight that never actually happened. In reality, the Taliban fighters were outnumbered by the villagers and had no intentions of attacking the village. They did, however, try to sneak in and capture Luttrell in secret. Luttrell also did not go into cardiac arrest after he was rescued, nor was he near death, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E

5|$|The {{reason for}} this is that the {{pressure}} difference across a fluid interface is proportional to the mean curvature, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Young–Laplace equation. For an open soap film, the pressure difference is zero, hence the mean curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean curvature.|$|E

An updated model, the Stage 2 EX, with extended memory capacity, was announced in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Barnum Brown {{recovered}} the first described remains of Saurolophus in 1911, including a nearly complete skeleton (AMNH 5220). Now {{on display in}} the American Museum of Natural History, this skeleton was the first nearly complete dinosaur skeleton from Canada. It was found in rocks of early Maastrichtian age, in the Upper Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon Formation (then known as the Edmonton Formation) near Tolman Ferry on the Red Deer River in Alberta. Brown wasted little time in describing his material, giving it its own subfamily. Saurolophus was an important early reference for other hadrosaurs, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> names of Prosaurolophus ("before Saurolophus") and Parasaurolophus ("near Saurolophus"). However, little additional material has been recovered and described.|$|E
5|$|During the November to May dry season, {{power output}} {{is limited by}} the river's flow rate, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{diagrams}} on the right. When there is enough flow, power output is limited by plant generating capacity. The maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site, assuming the water level is 175m and the plant gross efficiency is 90.15%. The actual power output in 2008 was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid.|$|E
5|$|From 1877 to 1882, Jovanović honed {{his artistic}} skills at Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts, {{studying}} under Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold Müller, among others. In {{the early part}} of his career, he painted mostly Orientalist works, which were in high demand at the time. The paintings were based on his own experiences in the Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa, and assured his fame among art connoisseurs in the West. In the late 1880s, Jovanović turned to history painting, depicting scenes from the history of the Serb people, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Takovo Uprising (1888). Nevertheless, his reputation as an Orientalist meant that he was best known for these types of works in his first decade as a professional artist.|$|E
