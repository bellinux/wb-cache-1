500|$|When {{choosing}} {{candidates for}} the Tatsunoko and Capcom character rosters, the development team was free to nominate any character it wished. However, the team faced limitations on its Tatsunoko candidates; Niitsuma explained, [...] " [...] had to consider licensing issues. Once we had that list we {{had to figure out}} how to make a balanced fighting game. On top of that we wanted a good balance between male and female characters." [...] Selection emphasis was placed on main characters, rather than on villains. Certain characters were denied by Tatsunoko Production without explanation to Capcom. [...] "We weren't privy to a lot of their decision making process. They didn't share <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> with us. When they said no and we asked why, they wouldn't tell us, but would give us another suggestion," [...] Niitsuma said. They disallowed characters from Genesis Climber MOSPEADA or Samurai Pizza Cats, despite the high number of fan requests for the latter. The eponymous characters of Tatsunoko's Muteking, The Dashing Warrior and Nurse Witch Komugi were among those planned for inclusion, but were eventually scrapped. The finalized Tatsunoko cast consists of characters that the team enjoyed in their youth. The development team hoped to include Capcom's Phoenix Wright and Franziska von Karma from the Ace Attorney series, but, while the latter's use of a whip made her easy to incorporate, the team struggled to find appropriate attacks for Phoenix. Since Phoenix doesn't move from the waist down in his original game environment, the team considered adding tires to his desk and having the entirety move as a single character. However, this was abandoned due to potential collision issues. Though they envisioned an attack that used his catch-phrase [...] "", with the letters themselves used to attack the opponent, they found that localization would have changed the Japanese four-character phrase (in kanji) to a ten-letter word in English, unbalancing the game. Arthur from Ghosts 'n Goblins, and Ingrid from Capcom Fighting Evolution were also scrapped.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{reinforced}} plastic composites are replacing metals {{which are being}} used for many years. This {{is due to the}} fact that {{reinforced plastic}}s have high strength to weigh ratio, low cost compared to metals, and high resistance to corrosion. However, the production of the composites nowadays is very challenging to meet the market requirement. Though natural sand is abundant in the world and very cheap, there are not many studies regarding the mechanical properties of natural sand particle reinforced composites. The objective for this thesis is to determine the tensile properties of natural-sand particle reinforced polymer composite and to validate the experimental results against theoretically calculations. To perform this, first we needed to prepare samples. The samples were prepared with mix and heat method. A few samples were produced by varying the sand weight percentage in the composites. Six samples were produced with 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, and 30 % sand percentage by weight. Next, the samples were tested with 3 -Point Bending Testing Machine and Universal Tensile Testing Machine to obtain the respective value of flexural and tensile properties of the composite samples. After that, the values obtained were compared against theoretical values which were obtained from calculation. The results obtained were in fair agreement with the experimental values. Both experimental values of the elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength were relatively low compared to theoretical ones. There may have <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> for this, but we believe that the primary reason {{is due to the fact}} that there is a critical point where the elastic modulus or ultimate tensile strength is at its lowest. In conclusion, the result is satisfying as the trend is similar although the values between theoretical and experimental are not exactly same...|$|R

In the last decade competition of developing countries became ruthless regarding the common textile like wool for <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>reason,</b> first <b>of</b> all cheaper labor. Industries started to move production over there but, fortunately, the know-how has remained here. For these reasons, since the past 10 years the world of textile, especially in Europe and USA, is moving to another kind of textile and garments dimension: the Technical Textile. Aramids are, since 90 's, the most important technical textile for protection garments, and in Biella district <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> factories started to handle them. Since some factories started to produce yarn and fabric for protective garments, the need to dye them has come. The market nowadays requires, even for protective goods, not only the conventional coloration with which the fiber is produced in large scale by manufacturers, but all the typical color ranges of other common textile fibers. Nomex® fiber is probably the most important m-aramid used for this scope and its dyeing recipes are well known. However, Nomex® is not easily available for factories due to particular commercial agreements, and is very expensive. Other branded m-aramid fibers exist on the market having same technical properties of Nomex® but, unfortunately, not exactly the same dyeability. In 2010 a regional research project called FILIDEA was born between Politecnico di Torino and Marchi&Fildi Company.

Moreover, the weight parameters of neural network are optimized by Interactive Honey Bee Matting optimization (IHBMO) to increase the efficiency of the capability of suggested procedure in tendered problem. Islanding is the situation where the distribution system including both distributed generator and loads is disconnected from the major grid as <b>a</b> consequence <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> such as electrical faults and their subsequent switching incidents, equipment failure, or pre-planned switching events like maintenance. The suggested method uses and combines wavelet analysis and artificial neural network together to detect islanding.

In passive schemes have a large Non Detection Zone (NDZ), concern has been raised on active method because of its lowering power quality impact. The main focus of the proposed scheme is to decrease the NDZ to as close as possible and to retain the output power quality fixed. The simulations results, performed by MATLAB/Simulink, demonstrate that the mentioned procedure has a small non-detection zone. What is more, this method is capable of detecting islanding precisely within the least possible amount of standard time. </p...|$|R
