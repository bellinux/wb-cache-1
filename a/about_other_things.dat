2500|$|The {{reasons for}} this big jump in the 1970s has been {{attributed}} by some scholars to widespread access to the birth control pill. While [...] "the pill" [...] was medically available in the 1960s, numerous laws restricted access to it. See, e.g., Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) (overturning a Connecticut statute barring access to contraceptives) and Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972) (establishing the right of unmarried people to access contraception). By the 1970s, the age of majority had been lowered from 21 to 18 in the United States, largely {{as a consequence of}} the Vietnam War; this also affected women's right to effect their own medical decisions. Since it had now become socially acceptable to postpone pregnancy even while married, women had the luxury of thinking <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> like education and work. Also, due to electrification women's work around the house became easier leaving them with more time to be able to dedicate to school or work. Due to the multiplier effect, even if some women were not blessed with access to the pill or electrification, many followed by the example of the other women entering the work force for those reasons. The Quiet Revolution is called such because it was not a [...] "big bang" [...] revolution; rather, it happened and is continuing to happen gradually.|$|E
2500|$|Sir Reginald Johnston {{arrived in}} the Forbidden City as Puyi's English tutor on 3 March 1919. Puyi had never met a {{foreigner}} prior to this, recalling: [...] "I have never seen foreign men. From the magazines, I noticed they had big mustaches. The eunuchs said the mustaches were very hard and a lantern could be hung at its ends". President Xu Shichang believed that the monarchy {{was going to be}} restored in China sooner or later, and to prepare Puyi for the challenges of the modern world had hired Johnston to teach Puyi [...] "subjects such as political science, constitutional history and English". Johnston was allowed only five texts in English to give Puyi to read, namely Alice in Wonderland and translations into English of the [...] "Four Great Books" [...] of Confucianism; the Analects, the Mencius, the Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean. However, Johnston disregarded the rules, and taught Puyi about world history with a special focus on British history. Johnston also told Puyi so much about his native Scotland that Puyi eventually expressed the desire to visit the [...] "Scotland the Brave" [...] that his tutor spoke of with such pride and love. Besides history, Johnston taught Puyi philosophy and about what he saw as the superiority of monarchies over republics. Puyi remembered that the piecing blue eyes of his tutor [...] "made me feel uneasy ... I found him very intimidating and studied English with him like a good boy, not daring to talk <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> when I got bored ... as I did with my other Chinese tutors".|$|E
