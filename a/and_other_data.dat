5|$|The Hollow Moon hypothesis, or Spaceship Moon hypothesis, {{proposes that}} Earth's Moon is either wholly hollow or {{otherwise}} contains a substantial interior space. No scientific evidence exists {{to support the}} idea; seismic observations <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>data</b> collected since spacecraft began to orbit or land on the Moon indicate {{that it has a}} thin crust, extensive mantle and small, dense core, although overall it is much less dense than Earth.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Weksler {{and colleagues}} {{followed}} the 2001 definition by Sánchez {{and others for}} the restricted genus Oryzomys, but added O.antillarum from Jamaica as a species. Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed Oryzomys from western Mexico in 2009 and in this context provided an extended diagnosis of Oryzomys. They recognized eight species: the six previously mentioned plus O.albiventer and O.peninsulae. Also in 2009, Robert Voss and Weksler identified the subfossil Oryzomys curasoae from Curaçao as an island population of O.gorgasi. The next year, Delton Hanson and colleagues published a study using DNA sequence data from the cytochrome b, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, and alcohol dehydrogenase 1 genes to assess relationships within Oryzomys. They recommended that the marsh rice rat be split into two species and that O.couesi be split into four species {{on the basis of}} the observed sequence divergence <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E
