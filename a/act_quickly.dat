Just like Napoleon, Kutuzov realized the importance of Pratzen and decided to protect the position. But the young Tsar did not, so he expelled the IV Corp from the Heights. This <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> pushed the Allied army into her grave.|$|E
5|$|During November 1908, Maeda went to Paris, France, {{apparently}} {{to see his}} friend Akitaro Ono. From Paris, he went to Havana, arriving there on December 14, 1908, and his twice-a-day wrestling <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> proved to be very popular. On July 23, 1909, Maeda left Havana for Mexico City. His debut in Mexico City {{took place at the}} Virginia Fabregas Theater on July 14, 1909. This show was a private demonstration for some military cadets. Shortly afterwards, Maeda began appearing at the Principal Theater. His standing offer was 100 pesos (US $50) to anyone he could not throw, and 500 pesos (US $250) to anyone who could throw him. The Mexican Herald did not record anyone taking his money.|$|E
5|$|Once a colossus is found, {{the player}} must {{discover}} its weaknesses to defeat it. Each colossus dwells {{in a unique}} lair, and many colossi cannot be defeated without making use of the surrounding environment. Every colossus {{has at least one}} weak point, indicated by a glowing sigil that can be illuminated and identified by the sword's reflected light. Each colossus has areas covered with fur or protruding ledges, which Wander may use to grip and scale the colossus while it thrashes about in an attempt to dislodge him. While scaling a colossus, the player must <b>act</b> <b>quickly,</b> as Wander has a limited stamina gauge that decreases while he hangs onto the creature.|$|E

25|$|McCormack stated: ”Preliminary {{tests show}} the {{insulation}} samples collected from Grenfell Tower combusted {{soon after the}} test started.

25|$|In Grenville's opinion, had Beneš {{held his}} line, the Communists {{would not have}} been able to form a government. The {{historian}} believed there could have been only two non-violent means of resolving the crisis—give way to the non-Communists or risk defeat in early elections which the KSČ would not have had time to rig. The non-Communists saw this as a moment of opportunity, needing to <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> before the Communists had total control over the police and threatened the electoral process.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory and}} {{application}} of these protective devices {{is an important part}} of the education of a power engineer who specializes in power system protection. The need to <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> to protect circuits and equipment as well as the general public often requires protective relays to respond and trip a breaker within a few thousandths of a second. In some instances these clearance times are prescribed in legislation or operating rules. A maintenance or testing program is used to determine the performance and availability of protection systems.|$|E
25|$|McGovern {{had failed}} to <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> when he learned of the mental health {{problems}} (though not their severe extent) because his own daughter was seriously depressed and he wondered what effect dumping Eagleton because of his depression would have on her. Ultimately, Eagleton threatened that if McGovern tried to force him off the ticket, he would fight the move. Eagleton conditioned his resignation on McGovern's releasing a statement, written by Eagleton, that Eagleton's health was fine and that McGovern had no issues with Eagleton's mental status.|$|E

25|$|To {{allow the}} {{government}} to <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> {{in case of a}} major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the President is permitted to call extraordinary sessions of one or both Houses of Congress. If the two Houses cannot agree on a date for adjournment, the President may adjourn both Houses to such a time as befits the circumstances. The last time this power was exercised was in 1948, when President Harry S Truman called a special session of Congress. That was the twenty-seventh time in American history that a president convened such a session.|$|E
25|$|Preoccupation with {{inflation}} was natural enough, after the steep rise of 1989 and the months immediately preceding {{the change of}} government. The monthly rate of inflation ranged between 25 percent and 32 {{percent in the second}} half of 1989, exceeded 40 percent in June 1990, and amounted to 78 percent by July. The deficit of the central government increased from 4 percent of GDP in January 1990 to 9 percent by May. The money supply of the country increased six times over from January to the end of July. The new government had to <b>act</b> <b>quickly,</b> and did.|$|E
25|$|On June 1, 2017, {{in light}} of the recent Trump Administration’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, California Democratic Senator Ricardo Lara {{proposed}} a bill to establish single-payer healthcare within the state of California (SB 562), calling on fellow senators to <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> in defense of healthcare. The legislation would implement “Medicare for All,” placing all levels of healthcare {{in the hands of the}} state. The bill proposed to the California Senate by Senator Lara lacked a method of funding required to finance the $400 billion-dollar policy. Despite this lack of foresight, the bill gained approval from the senate and will move on to await approval by the state assembly.|$|E

25|$|In biology, a {{disturbance}} {{is a temporary}} change in environmental conditions that causes a pronounced change in an ecosystem. Disturbances often <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> and with great effect, to alter the physical structure or arrangement of biotic and abiotic elements. Disturbance can also occur {{over a long period}} of time and can impact the biodiversity within an ecosystem. Major ecological disturbances may include fires, flooding, windstorms, insect outbreaks and trampling. Earthquakes, various types of volcanic eruptions, tsunami, firestorms, impact events, climate change, and the devastating effects of human impact on the environment (anthropogenic disturbances) such as clearcutting, forest clearing and the introduction of invasive species can be considered major disturbances. Disturbance forces can have profound immediate effects on ecosystems and can, accordingly, greatly alter the natural community. Because of these and the impacts on populations, disturbance determines the future shifts in dominance, various species successively becoming dominant as their life history characteristics, and associated life-forms, are exhibited over time.|$|E

500|$|The Byzantine {{campaign}} to Aquae Calidae {{and the threat}} in a letter by Nicholas Mystikos that numerous Byzantine troops were preparing to invade Bulgaria caused Simeon I to <b>act</b> <b>quickly.</b> He ordered a large army under Kaukanos e Menikos to head for Constantinople while Simeon I himself prepared another host to besiege {{the capital of the}} Theme of Thrace, Adrianople.

500|$|Irina Bokova, {{who is the}} Director-General of UNESCO, said, [...] "News of {{the murders}} of Gabriel Huge and Guillermo Luna Varela – {{tortured}} and killed less than {{one week after the}} murder of Regina Martínez Pérez – is deeply disturbing, and reflects an alarming state of affairs in the state of Veracruz. That these gruesome crimes have been committed on the eve of World Press Freedom Day – a day on which we honour the vital role played by journalists in upholding democratic values, protecting citizens’ rights to be informed and calling those in power to account – makes the situation all the more intolerable. I condemn these three murders in the strongest possible terms and urge the Mexican authorities to <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> and decisively to find those responsible. Impunity is not an option." ...|$|E
500|$|Melish sent form {{letters to}} {{collectors}} warning that his committee had received offers from speculators {{to buy the}} entire issue and suggesting they <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> to get their orders in. [...] By the end of July, Melish wrote that 24,000 pieces had been distributed and that the remaining thousand soon would be. Sales were good enough that in February 1937, Melish ordered the 25,000 pieces which remained from the authorized quantity. [...] In addition to those 25,000 coins, 15 more pieces were struck, intended for the 1938 Assay Commission. [...] Because of the legislation, the new pieces resembled the old exactly, including bearing the date [...] "1936". So many were produced that thousands were hoarded by coin dealers. In 1942, Melish offered 16,000 Cleveland Centennial half dollars to prominent dealer Abe Kosoff for any advance on face value. [...] Kosoff, who would, after Melish's death, auction his coin collection, declined.|$|E
500|$|According to Taliaferro, [...] "only {{after the}} deed was {{accomplished}} and Hay was installed as the {{ambassador to the}} Court of St. James's {{would it be possible}} to detect just how subtly and completely he had finessed his ally and friend, Whitelaw Reid". A telegraph from Hay to McKinley in the latter's papers, dated December 26 (most likely 1896) reveals the former's suggestion that McKinley tell Reid that the editor's friends had insisted that Reid not endanger his health through office, especially in London's smoggy climes. The following month, in a letter, Hay set forth his own case for the ambassadorship, and urged McKinley to <b>act</b> <b>quickly,</b> as suitable accommodations in London would be difficult to secure. Hay gained his object (as did Hanna), and shifted his focus to appeasing Reid. Taliaferro states that Reid never blamed Hay, but Kushner and Sherrill recorded, [...] "Reid was certain that he had been wronged" [...] by Hay, and the announcement of Hay's appointment nearly ended their 26-year friendship.|$|E
