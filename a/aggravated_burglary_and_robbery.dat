40|$|Combining two {{original}} {{pieces of}} research, {{the first on}} the spatial attributes of two types of crime and the second on the total social cost of the same crime, this paper proposes a methodology to evaluate the total socio-economic cost of spatial attributes related to <b>robbery</b> <b>and</b> <b>burglary.</b> Only recently have studies started to focus on particular types of crime, and extract their built environment characteristics. Most of these studies focus on <b>burglary</b> <b>and</b> <b>robbery</b> {{as it is the}} type of crime with the best record of location.
