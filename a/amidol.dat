25|$|Early in {{his career}} Weston printed on several kinds of paper, {{including}} Velox, Apex, Convira, Defender Velour Black and Haloid. When he went to Mexico {{he learned how to}} use platinum and palladium paper, made by Willis & Clement and imported from England. After his return to California, he abandoned platinum and palladium printing due to the scarcity and increasing price of the paper. Eventually he was able to get most of the same qualities he preferred with Kodak's Azo glossy silver gelatin paper developed in <b>Amidol.</b> He continued to use this paper almost exclusively until he stopped printing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amidol</b> is a colorless {{crystalline}} compound {{with the}} molecular structure C6H3(NH2)2OH. It is a dihydrogen chloride salt {{and is used}} as a photographic developer. It was introduced as a developing agent for photographic papers in 1892. It is unusual amongst developing agents as it works most effectively in slightly acid conditions rather than the strongly alkaline conditions required for most other developers. As <b>amidol</b> ages it changes color to a dark red-brown. Developing dishes and equipment used to prepare <b>amidol</b> solutions are also frequently stained brown, a stain that is very persistent.|$|E
50|$|Prints {{developed}} in <b>amidol</b> are typically {{a very warm}} brown-black colour, but overdevelopment can quickly lead to chemical fogging.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amidol's</b> {{color change}} upon {{oxidation}} {{is used to}} advantage as a convenient colorimetric method for measuring the dissolved oxygen concentration in water supplies, rivers, etc.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of photography, a wide range of {{developing}} agents were used, including chlorohydroquinone, ferrous oxalate,:131 hydroxylamine, ferrous lactate, ferrous citrate, Eikonogen, atchecin, antipyrin, acetanilid and <b>Amidol</b> (which unusually required mildly acidic conditions).|$|E
50|$|Dimepheptanol (INN; <b>Amidol,</b> Pangerin), {{also known}} as methadol or racemethadol, is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic related to methadone. It has similar effects to other opioids, including analgesia, sedation and euphoria, as well as side effects like itching, nausea and respiratory depression.|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic gave Memories of a Beautiful Disaster {{a rating}} of three out of five stars, and {{said that while the}} album was [...] "much more pop than rock," [...] in {{contrast}} to Durbin's American Idol performances, it [...] "does deliver the vocal goods here on material that should appeal to his <b>AmIdol</b> fan base." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song {{received}} considerable {{praise from}} music critics. Rolling Stone called the song [...] "a thrilling burst of Motown...to which Fantasia adds an amped-up ode to around-the-way boys". Allmusic's Stephen Erlewine stated that (it is) [...] "a dynamite single {{built on a}} blaring Supremes sample...It's inspired in concept and delivery, as Barrino pours her all into it and it works: with this one track, she sheds her <b>AmIdol</b> past and remakes herself into a vibrant, vital diva". Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "one of the best R&B numbers of the year." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{developing}} his 8x10 negatives, {{he did so}} by inspection {{during the}} development process. While the development was well underway, Baer briefly checked his highlight densities with a dim green safelight and continued development until he obtained his desired densities. He developed early Isopan and later Super XX Black & White film in his variation of ABC Pyro. [...] For some color work, Baer used Ektachrome film developed in a commercial developer but exposed at values he worked out in extensive testing. Although reluctant to use filters, Baer did so when necessary to make his photograph most effectively express the subject—as he described in technical entries in his several books. He seldom changed from his favorite print developer <b>Amidol</b> modifying it as necessary as printing papers evolved.|$|E
5000|$|The album's {{reception}} {{has been}} generally mixed to positive. Entertainment Weekly gave the album a positive review saying, [...] "They give David Cook's clutch of bombastic verse-chorus- verse rockers an impressive melodic sheen, one {{well suited to}} Cook's husky, expressive vocals. If anything, the series of booming midtempo anthems (most notable among them [...] "Bar-ba-sol" [...] and [...] "Mr. Sensitive") {{could use a little}} sandpapering around the edges." [...] Allmusic concurred writing, [...] "He not only is a star thanks to <b>AmIdol,</b> but he's always been ready to do big, happy, crowd-pleasing grunge-pop, as his self-released 2006 debut, Analog Heart, proved. David Cook is remarkably similar to that now-suppressed effort, heavy on crawling, melodic midtempo rockers and power ballads, only given more gloss in its production and writing." ...|$|E
5000|$|With his varied Navy {{photography}} experience, {{his many}} years of study, and intimate knowledge of his equipment, materials and darkroom techniques, Baer was well-qualified to take on any photographic assignment that came along. That confidence also allowed him {{to concentrate on the}} photographic task at hand, “… to interpret and thus to fully realize the potential for maximum expression… “ in his photographs. [...] In evaluating a potential photographic subject, Baer thought both in esthetic and organizational terms but also in the technical challenges he would face in actually making the photograph. His assistant once watched Baer as he stared at a subject tree muttering, 'I am looking at the Pyro in the tree trunks for the negative and the <b>Amidol</b> for the print in the leaves'. [...] He already was thinking of the technical problems he would have to solve in exposing the negative to get the tones he wanted in the final print.|$|E
5000|$|Princess P {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. A writer from AllMusic said that, [...] "Like {{a lot of}} <b>AmIdol</b> artists, Bennett's music can seem light and fluffy, but it's that very quality that makes Princess P a pleasurable pop concoction." [...] Adam B. Vary of Entertainment Weekly wrote about the album saying, [...] "Fans of Kewpie-sweet Paris Bennett from American Idols fifth season may never get over what they hear on Princess P, her debut CD. [...] "Imma {{give it to you}} straight no chaser," [...] she bellows on [...] "I'm So Hot," [...] the hardest - and least winning - of the album's hard-edged, surprisingly competent (but not catchy) club tracks. Other than the hook-soaked [...] "Get Bizzy" [...] (co-written by her mother, Jamecia), what gives these sub-Ciara songs their kick is Paris' full-throated delivery. The less said about her rap with Kevin [...] "Chicken Little" [...] Covais, meanwhile, the better." [...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today noted how Bennett and her team of songwriters and producers tend to [...] "cling to tried-and-true contemporary pop-R&B formulas." [...] She concluded with, [...] "Still, the album offers enough homespun charm to leave you rooting for the plucky upstart." [...] In a dual review with Elliott Yamin's self-titled debut, Vibe writer Sean Fennessey criticized the overly upbeat and pop-centric material that misuses Bennett's vocals to the point of anonymity, concluding that [...] "Unlike the goofily sincere Yamin, she never seems to be herself." ...|$|E
40|$|In this review, we {{describe}} {{direct and indirect}} photochemical approaches {{that have been developed}} for the preparation of phthalimide- and naphthalimide-based, lariat-type crown ethers. The direct route utilizes a strategy in which nitrogen-linked side chains containing polyethoxy-tethered phthalimides and naphthalimides, possessing terminal α-trialkylsilyl groups, are synthesized utilizing concise routes and UV-irradiation to form macrocyclic ring systems. In contrast, the indirect route developed for the synthesis of lariat-type crown ethers employs sequences in which SET-promoted macrocyclization reactions of α-trialkylsilyl-terminated, polyethoxy-tethered phthalimides and naphthalimides are followed by a side chain introduction through substitution reactions at the <b>amidol</b> centers in the macrocyclic ethers. The combined observations made in these investigations demonstrate the unique features of SET-promoted photocyclization reactions that make them well-suited for the use in the synthesis of functionalized crown ethers. In addition, while some limitations exist for the general use of SET-photochemical reactions in large-scale organic synthesis, important characteristics of the photoinduced macrocyclization reactions make them applicable to unique situations in which high temporal and spatial control is required...|$|E
40|$|There is {{considerable}} speculation in literature {{as to the}} mechanism of photographic emulsion stabilization by 4 -hydroxy- 6 -methyl- 1, 3, 3 a, 7 -tetraazaindene, (Aza). Aza is important as a stabilizer because, unlike the heterocyclic mercaptans, it causes no desensitization when the emulsion is processed in the commonly used MQ developing agents. The mercaptans are strongly adsorbed, whereas Aza is weakly adsorbed on silver halide. Therefore, there has been speculation that the stabilization mechanism of Aza is distinctly {{different from that of}} the mercaptans. For this work, Aza was tested as an antifogging agent and development restrainer along with KBr, as a reference, in two developers which function at emulsion pH, (6 to 7) : (1) <b>Amidol</b> at pH 6, 7, and 8, and (2) the ferrous ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) complex ion at pH 4. 5, 7. 0, 8. 5, and 10. 0. KODAK Fine Grain Positive Film, 5302, was used with both developers, and KODAK PANATOMIC-X Fine Grain Film, 5060, was used only with Fe-EDTA. Aza and KBr were compared sensitometrically for effects on fog, contrast index, and exposure index. This sensitometric evaluation comprises Section 1 of this work. The evaluation yielded evidence that at the pH of photographic emulsions, (near 7), and in concentrations of Aza normally used in the emulsions, (1 to 2 grams/mol Ag X), Aza, like KBr, was both a restrainer and an antifoggant during the development of the 5302 Film by both <b>Amidol</b> and Fe-EDTA. PANATOMIC-X Film, 5060, processed in Fe-EDTA gave similar results. The restraint of development by Aza decreased at pH values above 8. 5. This evidence and the fact that Aza is adsorbed on the grains of the emulsion to the same extent as the mercaptans, when present in amounts normally used, remove the necessity for assuming two distinctly different mechanisms of emulsion stabilization. The fact that Aza caused no desensitization or restraining action during development at the high pH of the commonly used MQ developers is explained by its desorption from the development centers. Section 2 of this work consists of a study in determining if there was an increase in the adsorption of Aza on silver bromide as a result of any effective increase in the concentration of Aza after drying the emulsion. An adsorption equilibrium exists between 1, 12 ̆ 7 -diethyl- 2, 22 ̆ 7 -cyanine iodide dye and Aza on silver bromide in the emulsion. Because the displacement, or deaggregation, of dye by Aza was evidenced by a decrease in the J-band strength of the dye, this decrease in J-band absorption at 575 nm was a convenient measure of the equilibrium. Aza not only decreased the J-band strength of the dye but also caused the appearance of two bands, identified as unaggregated dye in gelatin, one with maximum at 495 nm and the other near 530 nm. This is evidence that Aza not only deaggregated the dye but also displaced it from the AgBr. The analysis was made with a Beckman DK- 2 A Spectrophotometer which measured total reflectance and transmittance by means of an integrating sphere over the wavelength range 380 to 730 nm. From these data, absorption was calculated for the dye in the presence and the absence of Aza both wet and dry. The results of Section 2 of this work are evidence that the adsorption equilibrium between Aza and dye on silver bromide did not significantly change on drying the emulsion in spite of the change in the concentration of Aza from the wet to the dry emulsion...|$|E
