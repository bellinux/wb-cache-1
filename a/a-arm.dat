5|$|Shortly after stylists penned {{the first}} design sketches, Holden {{engineers}} {{began work on}} developing the chassis. Opel, which had {{provided the basis for}} all previous Commodore generations, ceased production of their rear-wheel drive Omega in 2003. This meant that Holden had two options: to use another GM platform, or to develop an all-new vehicle. GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform was to see production in the 2002 Cadillac CTS. Holden's engineers were offered this platform, but decided it was not appropriate. The Sigma platform's double <b>A-arm</b> front suspension and extensive use of aluminium were too costly for the VE's market segment. The luggage compartment was deemed too small and the Sigma interior package could not be stretched sufficiently to become a family-sized car. In particular, the rear-seat shoulder width was too tight. These major drawbacks made Holden decide to develop an all-new platform, known as the GM Zeta platform, on which a number of forthcoming GM vehicles will also be based. The Zeta suspension system comprises new double-pivot MacPherson strut for the front and a four-link independent rear setup. These replace the previous simple MacPherson strut design front and much criticised semi-trailing arm rear suspension, for improved ride and handling.|$|E
25|$|<b>A-arm</b> {{suspension}} (short upper arm, long lower arm) with coils {{was used}} at the front and swing axle suspension with semi-trailing arms, Panhard rods and a transverse semi-elliptical leaf spring was {{used at the}} rear.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} airheads, all oilhead GS models are shaft driven. The front suspension, however, was changed from {{conventional}} forks to the Telelever, developed by British company Saxon Motodd, {{which uses a}} control arm, called an <b>A-arm</b> by BMW to eliminate dive under braking.|$|E
50|$|The Slayer is a {{four-wheel drive}} short-course nitro race truck. This vehicle shares many parts {{with the two}} nitro Revos {{including}} the suspension (excepting the suspension arms, which are shorter and only have one push-rod mounting hole), chassis from the 2.5, and engine of the 3.3. The body of the Slayer is larger than normal 1/10 scale vehicles; this moves the tires inboard the body rather than outboard like other stadium trucks on the market today. Slayer comes stock RTR with the TRX 3.3 racing engine and has a claimed top speed of 50+ mph.A newer version of the Slayer was released in 2010 to update the race replica style, Slayer Pro 4x4 has BFGoodrich Mud Terrain tires or Kumho Road Venture tires. Along with the new tires new shells were released to capture the latest TORC looks.An extended wheelbase and longer <b>A-Arms</b> were added to make the ultimate nitro short course R/C race truck.|$|R
5000|$|Rutgers entered {{its first}} carbon fiber {{monocoque}} in the 1994 {{competition at the}} Pontiac Silverdome. The front half of the car was constructed of pre-preg carbon fiber with a Nomex honeycomb core. 3 sandwich panel aluminum bulkheads were used to mount the front suspension and master cylinders. The rear half of the car was constructed of 4130 steel tubing. One {{of the most dramatic}} features of the car was the use of very long lower <b>A-Arms.</b> They were so long, that there was only about 1 inch of space between the left and right mounts on the chassis. The composite construction made use of very simple molds made primarily from sheetmetal and wood. There were no compound curves to any of the molds for the monocoque. Shifting was performed by steering wheel push buttons via pneumatics (an FSAE first). The brakes used 200mm OD cast iron vented rotors. The engine was a naturally aspirated Kawasaki Ninja 600R, making 73 RWHp.Result Highlights:Presentation - 7th Place,Design - 13th Place,Acceleration - 13th Place,Skid Pad - 5th Place,Autocross - 3rd Place,Endurance - 7th Place (22 Cones and 3 spin outs),Economy - 6th,Overall - 9thThis car earned the [...] "Best Prototype Fabrication Award" ...|$|R
2500|$|The 501 was an all-new platform, with a {{perimeter}} frame, double <b>A-arm</b> front suspension with {{torsion bar}} springs, and a live axle with torsion bar springs at the rear. [...] The steering mechanism {{was similar to}} a rack and pinion system except that the rack was semi-circular instead of straight.|$|E
2500|$|... 84–87 front {{suspension}} is a wider direct {{derivative of}} the Chevrolet Chevette and Pontiac T1000. It employs a double <b>A-arm</b> (or double wishbone) design common {{prior to the}} advent of struts, and has naturally good geometry. A drawback of this design, however, means that the car's front suspension has four ball joints. Nevertheless, the tie-rods allow toe-in/out adjustability. Minimal camber adjustments exist on 1984 to 1987 models without an after-market upgrade that replaces the upper ball joints with slotted mounting points units. The joints have typical grease fittings for regular lubrication commonly found on pre-2000 autos.|$|E
2500|$|The 400 was {{replaced}} for 1970 with the [...] Buick V8, {{used in the}} GS 455. The base model V8 was rated 350hp (260kW) and [...] at 2800 rpm. In the optional Stage1 trim it was rated** 360hp (268kW) and 510lb·ft (691Nm) at a low 2800 rpm. As with all American engines produced prior to the 1972 model year, these were SAE gross ratings, which are generally significantly higher than SAE net ratings and are not indicative of what actual production engines produce in their [...] "as installed" [...] condition (with all engine accessories and full exhaust system in place). [...] The fastest magazine test results from this period were obtained by MOTOR TREND Magazine, which managed to extract a 13.38 ET @ 105.5 MPH from their 3,810 pound GS Stage 1 coupe test car. Using Hale's Trap Speed formula, this result indicated actual [...] "as installed" [...] peak HP of approximately 360 SAE Net (ironically the same as its advertised Gross Figure, meaning this engine was very conservatively rated for that time period). [...] The use of the larger sized 455 block created a maintenance problem by the exhaust manifolds being in too {{close proximity to the}} upper and lower <b>A-arm</b> bushings. [...] Heat would literally melt the <b>A-arm</b> bushings after {{a relatively short period of}} time; rapid tire wear and front end alignment difficulties were the first sign of this common problem, which was common to all makes and models of this GM body style with the 455 engine. [...] It was not uncommon for front ends to be rebuilt with grease fittings added, to [...] "lube" [...] the bushings at the A-arms, to help against the heat.|$|E
2500|$|Majeski raced {{four times}} during the LaCrosse Oktoberfest weekend; he won the late model feature on Thursday night, the Dick Trickle 99 on Friday night, the JMcK 63 Big 8 Series race on Saturday night. With 10 laps to go, he was leading the ARCA Midwest Tour race on Sunday when a vapor lock caused his car to {{temporarily}} lose power on a restart; he finished third. Majeski traveled across the United States to Florida for the Governor's Cup at New Smyrna Speedway in November. He started 27th after an <b>A-arm</b> broke in qualifying. After passing up through the entire field, Majeski held off Steven Wallace on numerous restarts to take the win. Dale Earnhardt, Jr. tweeted about Majeski's win calling him [...] "the Deal". At the Snowball Derby, Majeski qualified second quickest and was awarded the pole position after Christopher Bell's Kyle Busch Motorsports entry was disqualified.|$|E
5000|$|This car {{introduced}} the {{independent front suspension}} to the Packard line. Its so-called [...] "Safe-T-Flex" [...] suspension was an unequal upper and lower <b>A-arm</b> type with the largest possible lower <b>A-arm</b> composed of two different arms bolted together at a ninety-degree angle.|$|E

50|$|A {{short long}} arms {{suspension}} (SLA) {{is also known}} as an unequal length double wishbone suspension. The upper arm is typically an <b>A-arm,</b> and is shorter than the lower link, which is an <b>A-arm</b> or an L-arm, or sometimes a pair of tension/compression arms. In the latter case the suspension can be called a multi-link, or dual ball joint suspension.|$|E
50|$|The {{support arm}} carried all the load; the torque arm carried the {{accelerating}} and decelerating torque; the upper <b>A-arm</b> controlled the camber. Advantages claimed {{for the system}} included superior maintenance of wheel alignment from the wide spread of the lower <b>A-arm,</b> a permanent fixing of the caster angle, and an increased percentage of the braking force transmitted to the frame through the torque arm.|$|E
50|$|Suspension must retain {{original}} {{front end}} concept (i-beam, <b>a-arm)</b> and retain {{entire length of}} stock frame rails.|$|E

50|$|In {{automotive}} suspension, {{a control}} arm, {{also known as}} an <b>A-arm,</b> is a hinged suspension link between the chassis and the suspension upright or hub that carries the wheel.|$|E
50|$|The Mk II's MacPherson strut front {{suspension}} {{was replaced}} with more conventional double <b>A-arm</b> suspension to give the car a soft 'freeway' ride, which gave the larger engines distinct understeer.|$|E
50|$|The Mark IV {{was built}} over the winter in 1962 and 1963. It {{featured}} a space frame chassis made of thin wall chrome-moly tubing. The body was clothed in aluminum and original powered by a modified Ford FJ engine mated to a Hewland MKIV five speed gearbox. In the front was a conventional upper and lower <b>A-arm</b> suspension setup, with a reversed lower <b>A-arm</b> and upper top link in the rear. Girling brakes, courtesy of a Lotus 21 F1 car, could be found at all four corners. The large fuel tank meant it could race more than the traditional 20 lap Formula Junior race.|$|E
50|$|This kind of {{suspension}} system mainly consist of independent suspension (e.g., MacPherson strut, <b>A-arm</b> (double wishbone)). With addition with these {{suspension system}} {{there is a}} further tilting or leaning mechanism which connects the suspension system with the vehicle body (chassis).|$|E
50|$|The MacPherson strut front {{suspension}} {{was replaced}} with more conventional double <b>A-arm</b> suspension (Also known as double wishbone suspension) which gave the Mark III a much softer ride on the road' but did give cars fitted with the larger, heavier engines distinct understeer.|$|E
50|$|Suspension {{is fully}} {{independent}} coil-sprung {{and of the}} double <b>A-arm</b> type. Optional mobility enhancements included run-flat inserts and a central tyre inflation system (CTIS). Quoted standard tyre size for WTC variants is 37 × 25.50R 16.5, and for NTC variants is 285/70 R17.|$|E
50|$|As {{with the}} airheads, all oilhead GS models are shaft driven. The front suspension, however, was changed from {{conventional}} forks to the Telelever, developed by British company Saxon Motodd, {{which uses a}} control arm, called an <b>A-arm</b> by BMW to eliminate dive under braking.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanical}} components, including engine, suspension, and transmission, {{could be}} drawn from the Ford Pinto, Mercury Bobcat, or Ford Mustang II. Based on these donor choices, the suspension is relatively unsophisticated, with a solid rear axle mounted on quarter-elliptical leaf springs. The donor leaf springs are cut approximately in half, with just one of the halves {{on each side of the}} differential making up the rear springing. The rear axle is actually mounted above the side rails of the frame, which keeps the frame design simple but limits the axle's vertical range of movement. The front suspension is a somewhat sportier double-wishbone design, built from the donor car's lower <b>A-arm</b> and a custom upper <b>A-arm,</b> with coil-over shocks and the donor's disk brakes.|$|E
5000|$|The 501 was an all-new platform, with a {{perimeter}} frame, double <b>A-arm</b> front suspension with {{torsion bar}} springs, and a live axle with torsion bar springs at the rear. [...] The steering mechanism {{was similar to}} a rack and pinion system except that the rack was semi-circular instead of straight.|$|E
50|$|Front {{suspension}} was parallel double wishbones, with {{torsion bar}} springs and an anti-roll bar. Rear suspension had a live axle, also sprung by torsion bars, and located by a Panhard rod and a central, transverse <b>A-arm</b> to control acceleration and braking forces. Brakes were Alfin drum brakes of 284.5 mm (11.2 in) diameter, and power brakes were optional. Late-model 507s had front Girling disc brakes.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{original}} Seven, the front lower <b>A-arm</b> (or [...] "wishbone") {{of the double}} wishbone suspension is traditional, but {{for the purpose of}} reducing weight, the upper suspension integrated an anti-roll (anti-sway) bar into a horizontal suspension arm. This approach formed a pseudo-wishbone which was semi-independent in nature. This approach worked well with early crossply tyres, but with later radials, the configuration seriously affected its adjustability.|$|E
50|$|The Isuzu Faster used a {{traditional}} pickup truck chassis with a ladder frame and a leaf spring live axle rear suspension. At the front, the <b>A-arm</b> suspension used an independent configuration. The 2600 mm wheelbase {{was similar to}} its competitors, as was the 1855 mm cargo bay. Unlike for the preceding Wasp, {{there was also a}} long wheelbase version (KB25) which had 2995 mm between the axles, which made for a 2290 mm bed.|$|E
50|$|The GMT 355 is the {{redesigned}} S/T compact {{pickup truck}} {{design and the}} successor to the GMT 325 series. GMT 355s are built in Shreveport, Louisiana and Rayong, Thailand. GMT 355 uses an <b>A-arm</b> independent suspension in front and live axle with leaf springs in the rear. The Atlas straight-4 and straight-5 engines are widely used, starting in 2009, a 5.3L V8 was added. A 4-speed automatic and 5-speed manual transmission are also specified.|$|E
50|$|The Zeta {{architecture}} {{was designed}} for great flexibility and could accommodate {{a wide variety of}} automotive features such as wheelbase length, ride height, windshield rake and roof line. Zeta's suspension system was all wheel independent and utilizes a MacPherson strut coupled with a dual ball joint lower <b>A-arm</b> for the front and a four link independent setup for the rear wheels. The engine was mounted slightly behind the front axle giving improved weight distribution.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2009, the BYU Mars Rover is a four-wheel drive, {{skid steer}} type vehicle, {{approximately}} 36" [...] long, 40" [...] wide, and 20" [...] tall (excluding antenna and camera mast). Each wheel is approximately 12" [...] in diameter, and {{is powered by}} a brushless electric motor and planetary gearbox. The suspension is a fully independent <b>A-arm</b> design, with CNC milled A-arms, and is well integrated into the rover chassis in order to reduce weight and complexity.|$|E
5000|$|All Datsun trucks {{kept the}} <b>A-arm</b> torsion bar front {{suspension}} with leaf-sprung rear ends {{and had a}} 1/2 ton load capacity. Rear end gearing was a low 4.875:1 along with a four-speed transmission; as a result, the 320 was not freeway friendly above 60 mph. Fender emblems showed [...] "Datsun 1200" [...] and [...] "60 HP" [...] ("55ps" [...] for models sold in Japan) with a [...] "Datsun" [...] emblem on the front nose of the hood.|$|E
5000|$|The New Traxxas X-Maxx. T-Maxx uses {{a single}} plate {{aluminum}} chassis, braced underneath by beam supports. The suspension used a fully independent double <b>A-arm</b> design, supported by eight coil over shocks, two on each corner. The drive system {{consisted of a}} mid-mounted Pro [...]15 nitro engine and a mid-mounted two-speed transmission driving a permanent four-wheel drive system with no center differential. The tires were massive 5.75 x 3.5 inch [...] "chevron" [...] style tires mounted on 3.2 inch wheels.|$|E
50|$|Suspension {{travel is}} around two-feet (26", 66 cm) of wheel {{travel in the}} front and three-feet (32", 81 cm) of travel in the rear, {{although}} this may vary depending on chassis design. Most Trophy Trucks use independent <b>A-arm</b> suspensions up front. In the rear, most trucks feature a three or four-link setup with a solid rear axle, while some use various types of independent suspension. Fox Racing Shox, Bilstein and King Shocks are popular amongst competitors, previously top Trophy Truck teams manufactured their own.|$|E
