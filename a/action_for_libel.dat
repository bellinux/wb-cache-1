Having sought several opinions on the authority of his suit, he retained Sir Edward Carson and two juniors, one of whom was Frederick Edwin Smith, later Lord Birkenhead. For the defendants, Rufus Isaacs, later Marquess of Reading and Viceroy of India, assisted by another K.C. and two juniors, acted for Associated Newspapers Ltd. Lever’s legal team were in no doubt of the outcome; as F.E. Smith reportedly observed 'There is no answer to this <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>libel</b> and the damages must be enormous.' On 15 July 1907 the case came up at Liverpool before Mr Justice Lawrence.|$|E

60|$|Of course such {{an article}} had {{considerable}} effect. It was apparent {{at once that}} there was ample room for an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>libel</b> against the newspaper, {{on the part of}} Phineas Finn if not on that of the Duke. But it was equally apparent that Mr. Quintus Slide must have been very well aware of this when he wrote the article. Such an action, even if successful, may bring with it to the man punished more of good than of evil. Any pecuniary penalty might be more than recouped by the largeness of the advertisement which such an action would produce. Mr. Slide no doubt calculated that he would carry with him a great body of public feeling by the mere fact that he had attacked a Prime Minister and a Duke. If he could only get all the publicans in London to take his paper because of his patriotic and bold conduct, the fortune of the paper would be made.

5000|$|Prior {{restraint}} {{is often}} considered a particularly oppressive form of censorship in Anglo-American jurisprudence because it prevents the restricted material from being heard or distributed at all. Other forms of restrictions on expression (such as <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>libel</b> or criminal libel, slander, defamation, and contempt of court) implement criminal or civil sanctions {{only after the}} offending material has been published. While such sanctions {{might lead to a}} chilling effect, legal commentators argue that at least such actions do not directly impoverish the marketplace of ideas. Prior restraint, on the other hand, takes an idea or material completely out of the marketplace. Thus it is often considered to be the most extreme form of censorship. The United States Supreme Court expressed this view in Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart by noting: The thread running through all these cases is that prior restraints on speech and publication are the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on First Amendment rights. A criminal penalty or a judgment in a defamation case is subject to the whole panoply of protections afforded by deferring the impact of the judgment until all avenues of appellate review have been exhausted. Only after judgment has become final, correct or otherwise, does the law's sanction become fully operative. [...] A prior restraint, by contrast and by definition, has an immediate and irreversible sanction. If {{it can be said that}} a threat of criminal or civil sanctions after publication 'chills' speech, prior restraint 'freezes' it at least for the time.|$|R
