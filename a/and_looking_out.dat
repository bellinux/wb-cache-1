Eventually she turned to stone, dust and leaves building up around her until she became a part of the escarpment. She is known today as Mount Keira.|$|E

500|$|The balcony {{scene was}} {{introduced}} by Da Porto in 1524. He had Romeo walk frequently by her house, [...] "sometimes climbing to her chamber window" [...] and wrote, [...] "It happened one night, as love ordained, when the moon shone unusually bright, that whilst Romeo was climbing the balcony, the young lady ... opened the window, <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> saw him". After this they have a conversation in which they declare eternal love to each other. A few decades later, Bandello greatly expanded this scene, diverging from the familiar one: Julia has her nurse deliver a letter asking Romeo {{to come to her}} window with a rope ladder, and he climbs the balcony {{with the help of his}} servant, Julia and the nurse (the servants discreetly withdraw after this).|$|E

Chef pulls up {{in his car and}} asks if the boys saw the alien spaceship the previous evening, inadvertently confirming Cartman's [...] "dream", and relays stories of alien anal probes (which throughout the episode Cartman denies he experienced).

500|$|The {{music video}} starts {{off with a}} blue monitor screen with an eye showing the {{inscription}} [...] "Welcome". The video progresses inside a blue space ship-style room with Madonna lying prostrate in {{what seems to be}} a scientific experiment. The imagery cast in this section of the video have drawn comparisons to hermeticism. The video progresses into a sequence of dreams, containing varied surrealistic, mystic, new age, Sufi and Egyptian imagery and symbolism. Such include a scene in which Madonna lies on a rotating sunflower, and images of a woman with long hair, an alchemist-type man holding a cube with Madonna's face on each side as well as rotating Sufi dancers. The dream sequence progresses with unusual clips, including Madonna in a pool with half-visible skulls. A scene in which Madonna, dressed in a light dressing gown, gives birth to doves, can also be seen; the image has been compared to the work of René Magritte and Kahlo's 1932 painting My Birth. Suddenly, she floats down a corridor in a white gown and appears in a black-and-white projection in a cinema-like room. As the music gets more dramatic, the dream grows intense, with images of skulls and scars appearing, and the singer can be seen wading through space. A scene in which Madonna's eyes are replaced with her mouth and her mouth with an eye precedes the ending, influenced by the work of Kahlo; the final shots show Madonna waking up <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As {{a symbol}} of the tension between the writing {{imagination}} and the constraint of one's environment, the tower has appeared in the writings of many other writers than Montaigne. For instance, [...] "Montaigne's Tower" [...] is the title of a poem by Geoffrey Grigson, published in the 1984 collection Montaigne's Tower and Other Poems. It probes the relation between the writer, his immediate environment, and the compass of his imagination by imaging Montaigne at work in his library <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> at the countryside surrounding the castle after asking its initial question: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Soul Is Not a Smithy" [...] was {{originally}} published in AGNI #57 (2003). Scott M. Morris, in his review of the collection, suggested that this story [...] "may well be a masterpiece." [...] The title apparently refers to the penultimate paragraph of James Joyce's novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, in which Stephen Dedalus writes: [...] "Welcome, O life! I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race." [...] In this narrative, an unnamed narrator recounts {{his experience as a}} boy in his fourth grade civics class in Columbus, Ohio. The substitute teacher Mr. Johnson suffers a psychotic breakdown, which results in a hostage crisis, but the narrator spends his time daydreaming <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> of the classroom window.|$|E

2500|$|Such boar-shapes {{may have}} been like those on the Sutton Hoo helmet, {{terminating}} {{at the ends of}} the eyebrows <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> over the cheek guards. Beowulf himself dons a helmet [...] "set around with boar images" [...] (...) before his fight with Grendel's mother; further described as [...] "the white helmet [...] [...] [...] enhanced by treasure" [...] (...) , a similar description could have been applied to the tinned Sutton Hoo example. (The two helmets would not have been identical, however; Beowulf's was further described as [...] "encircled in lordly links"——a possible reference to the type of chain mail on the Valsgärde 6 and 8 helmets that provided neck and face protection.) The other style of boar adornment, mentioned three times in the poem, appears to refer to helmets with a freestanding boar atop the crest. When Hrothgar laments the death of his close friend Æschere, he recalls how Æschere was [...] "my right hand man when the ranks clashed and our boar-crests had to take a battering in the line of action." [...] These crests were probably more similar to those on the Benty Grange and Wollaston helmets, a detached boar found in Guilden Morden, and those seen in contemporary imagery on the Vendel 1 and Valsgärde 7 helmets and on the Torslunda plates (...)

2500|$|Robert Lawson was chiefly an {{architect}} of his time, designing in the styles then popular. The British emigrants to the colonies wanted architecture {{to remind them}} of home, and thus {{it is not surprising}} that Lawson's most notable buildings are all in a form of Gothic. Many, such as Larnach Castle and Seacliff Asylum, have been described as Scottish baronial; however, this is not an accurate description, although that particular form of Gothic may have been at times his inspiration. Lawson's particular skill was mixing various forms of similar architecture to create a building that was in its own way unique, rather than a mere pastiche of an earlier style; having achieved this, he then went on to adapt his architecture to accommodate the climate and materials locally available. Local stone and wood were particular favourites of his, especially the good quality limestone of Oamaru, and these were often used in preference to the excellent bricks equally available. Small Gothic Lancet windows were often avoided and replaced by large bay windows, allowing the rooms to be flooded with light rather than creating the darker interiors of true Gothic buildings. Larnach Castle has often been criticised as being clumsy and incongruous, but this derives from the persistent misinterpretation of Lawson's work as Scottish baronial. It is true that in a Scottish glen, much of his work would be incongruous, but Lawson realised that he was designing not for the glens and mountains of his homeland, but rather for a new country, with new ideals and vast vistas. Thus, set upon its two-storeyed verandahs, <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> over the Otago Peninsula and Otago Harbour from [...] above sea level, the mansion seems perfectly positioned.|$|E
