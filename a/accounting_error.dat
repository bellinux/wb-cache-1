25|$|In September 2014, faculty, parents, and {{students}} were {{made aware of}} a $1 million-plus deficit the school had discovered. An <b>accounting</b> <b>error</b> had caused Uni to take money out of a closed bank account, resulting in the huge deficit.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{a simple}} <b>accounting</b> <b>error</b> to think, that the gross profit share of {{value-added}} is equal to true business profit, or that constant capital invested in physical assets (fixed equipment and inventories) represents the capital that an enterprise owns, other than a fund to pay wages, or that profits from product sales are the only net income the corporation has. That can be verified from any corporate balance sheet. If an enterprise borrows or leases capital for production, rather than investing its own, this affects the cost of capital that is tied up at any particular time. How the profitability of capital is accounted for, depends very much on who owns the capital, as distinct from who borrows it, or who uses it. So the rate of profit concept which Marx uses in his theoretical analysis of capitalist production (i.e. S/(C+V)) differs from the actual business concept of the rate of profit, because it disregards all sorts of financial and ownership issues, and because it concerns only part of the total circuit of capital.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the study}} committee's report, {{the school board}} agreed to use a {{one-time}} refund on insurance premiums to pay for $575,000 in repairs at Memorial Stadium. These included east bleacher drainage improvements, east bleacher foundation and stairway improvements, and adding handicapped-accessible areas to both {{the east and west}} grandstands. The cost of these upgrades increased to $600,000 in May 2000. Costs had actually decreased because an engineer's assessment came in lower than expected and an <b>accounting</b> <b>error</b> was discovered that removed double-counting of expenses. With the additional expenditure of just $25,000, however, the work could now be expanded to include entirely replacing the east bleachers, replacing the running track, and doubling the size of the team meeting/concessions buildings. In May 2000, the work was expected to be complete by the fall. The school board had yet to decide whether the track should be expanded to 10 lanes, but did agree to solicit bids to determine the cost of improving the west grandstand. The track was expanded to eight lanes two weeks later. The track work contract came in 16 percent low, which enabled the school district to add improvements to the long-jump paths and pits as well. The contract for replacing the east bleachers, however, came in $95,000 high after contractors discovered that the existing drainage system was far more damaged than previously suspected. In June 2000, the school board agreed to tap its general maintenance fund to pay for the work on the west bleachers after these cost estimates came in much lower than expected.|$|E

500|$|Gary K. Wolf, {{author of}} the novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit?, filed a lawsuit in 2001 against The Walt Disney Company. Wolf claimed he was owed {{royalties}} based {{on the value of}} [...] "gross receipts" [...] and merchandising sales. In 2002, the trial court in the case ruled that these only referred to actual cash receipts Disney collected and denied Wolf's claim. In its January 2004 ruling, the California Court of Appeal disagreed, finding that expert testimony introduced by Wolf regarding the customary use of [...] "gross receipts" [...] in the entertainment business could support a broader reading of the term. The ruling vacated the trial court's order in favor of Disney and remanded the case for further proceedings. In a March 2005 hearing, Wolf estimated he was owed $7 million. Disney's attorneys not only disputed the claim but said Wolf actually owed Disney $500,000–$1 million because of an <b>accounting</b> <b>error</b> discovered in preparing for the lawsuit. Wolf won the decision in 2005, receiving between $180,000 and $400,000 in damages.|$|E

[...] Moody's Investors Service announced it was reviewing all US$4 billion of Dynegy debt. In financial distress, Dynegy successfully applied for a US$900 million line of credit. On May 1, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened a formal investigation into how Dynegy's [...] "Project Alpha", an internal corporate initiative that allegedly inflated income from natural gas transactions and illegally structured business partnerships to avoid income. Two weeks later, the New York Times reported that Dynegy's Illinova subsidiary was part of the investigation. [...] Illinova had formed a joint partnership named Catlin in January 2000 with a little-known investment company named Black Thunder. Catlin took over some of Illinova's electrical generating assets. [...] Although Black Thunder put up almost 90 percent of the money to form Catlin, Dynegy was required to buy out Black Thunder's investment or sell off the assets if Catlin did not earn a specified high rate of return. On May 28, Dynegy founder, president, and chief executive officer Charles Watson resigned. Dynegy Inc. chairman Dan Dienstbier was named interim CEO. In mid-June, Dynegy reported that its first quarter income had fallen 80 percent. It also admitted that it had signed long-term power contracts that would not produce revenue for years to come. [...] But it had charged the income to the current year's revenues in an attempt to bolster its bottom line. On June 19, Dynegy's chief financial office, Rob Doty, resigned.

40|$|This study {{draws on}} the {{theoretical}} framework of Hofstede 2 ̆ 7 s model to {{examine the impact of}} different cultural dimensions on audit‐detected <b>accounting</b> <b>errors.</b> Based on the <b>accounting</b> <b>errors</b> detected in 80 foreign enterprises of different cultures operating in China, we test the direct effect of the cultural dimensions, power distance and individualism, on the magnitude of <b>accounting</b> <b>errors.</b> The results indicate that power distance and individualism have significant explanatory power in describing the differences in the relative magnitude of errors. Centralization of power in a few individuals, management override of controls, and less competent personnel are important attributes of a large power distance enterprise that contribute to larger errors. Enterprises of an individualist culture, which are characterized by higher personnel turnover and more reliance on accounting numbers for individual performance evaluation, are found to have larger errors. These results should be useful for auditors in assessing the likelihood of material errors from a cultural perspective...|$|R
