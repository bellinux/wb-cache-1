40|$|Title: The Czech and German Reformations in the {{illustration}} of Czech {{books in the}} first half of the 16 th century. [...] In contrast to the German lands, very few manifestations of Reformation illustration in Bohemia have been preserved. This is due, on the one hand, to the slow <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> or textual illustrations in the Czech lands, and on the other, the shortage of native graphic artists. For printers in Bohemia it was more economical to borrow or purchase second-hand goods from Germany than to invest in the building of new centres of graphic art, as was done thoroughly and innovatively by the Severins from 1533 onwards. Despite the fact that the Nuremberg printing plates introduced to Bohemia and Moravia by printers in the 1520 s- 40 s were frequently worn-out, they remained in circulation in the Czech lands and Poland throughout the whole 16 th century, and sometimes much longer. The author finds the third major reason for the limited number of illustrations to be due to the contemporary literary landscape, the greater part of which covered the religious needs of the Utraquist Church and the Unity of the Brethren. There was significant movement on only two occasions, first of all in the 1520 s, when, despite censorship, ten translations of Luther’s treatises were published in quick succession, and the Utraquists printed the works of Chelčický and Hus. At the same time, thanks to the Bohemian Master of fine hatching, there was a brief flourishing of the portrait and Reformation satire. These were, however, a phenomenon of the contents of printed works, and not the title page. The second wave occurred in the 1540 s. However, as Prague-based literary graphic art was dominated by the Severin workshop until 1542, distinguished by its ideological neutrality and entertaining elements on decorative pages, it was more convenient to reuse older German printing plates. Due to their extended functionality and mobility, these plates came to be utilised in a wide variety of literary and confessional contexts, and they lost their original meaning. Thus the most frequently documented propagators of Reformation iconography in literature were not printers and illustrators, but bookbinders, whose work it was very difficult for preliminary state or church censorship to uncover. Printing rolls with portraits of reformers started to reach Bohemia from around 1546 onwards. ISBN 978 - 80 - 86890 - 57 -...|$|E

5000|$|The Irish Free State, {{founded in}} 1922, gave no special recognition, but in 1938, the then Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, at {{the inauguration of}} Dr. Douglas Hyde as President of Ireland, welcomed the {{incoming}} President with these words. [...] "In you we greet the successor of our rightful princes and in your accession to office we hail {{the closing of the}} breach that has existed since the undoing of our nation at Kinsale". In 1948 the government suggested {{that there should be a}} [...] "Council" [...] of chiefs, accredited by the Herald, for emotive reasons. In Irish and English law a title is a possession, classed as an [...] "incorporeal hereditament", but the 1937 Irish Constitution forbids the conferring <b>of</b> <b>titles</b> <b>of</b> nobility by the state, as well as the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>titles</b> <b>of</b> nobility or honour without the prior permission of the government. Therefore, the Council was also a means of allowing them to use their titles, but only as honorifics and without any political function. In 1943 the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) therefore agreed with Edward McLysaght, then Chief Herald of Ireland, that the titles would be known as [...] "designations" [...] made by the Herald's Office to avoid the constitutional ban. McLysaght deplored that anyone could perfectly legally describe themselves as [...] "chief of the name" [...] (such as The O'Rahilly) without having any written proof of descent, if nobody else claimed the very same title.|$|R

5|$|The {{exact nature}} of {{relations}} between Tibet and the Ming dynasty of China (1368–1644) is unclear. Analysis of the relationship is further complicated by modern political conflicts {{and the application of}} Westphalian sovereignty to a time when the concept did not exist. Some Mainland Chinese scholars, such as Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain, assert that the Ming dynasty had unquestioned sovereignty over Tibet, pointing to the Ming court's issuing <b>of</b> various <b>titles</b> to Tibetan leaders, Tibetans' full <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> these <b>titles,</b> and a renewal process for successors <b>of</b> these <b>titles</b> that involved traveling to the Ming capital. Scholars within China also argue that Tibet has been an integral part of China since the 13th century and that it was thus a part of the Ming Empire. But most scholars outside China, such as Turrell V. Wylie, Melvin C. Goldstein, and Helmut Hoffman, say that the relationship was one of suzerainty, that Ming titles were only nominal, that Tibet remained an independent region outside Ming control, and that it simply paid tribute until the Jiajing Emperor (1521–1566), who ceased relations with Tibet.|$|R

50|$|The Act {{resulted}} {{largely from}} the protests of one man, the Labour politician Tony Benn, then the 2nd Viscount Stansgate.

Roman leaders, in republic and empire, had to abide by a well-developed system of political values, in which military success, alongside and above other cardinal virtutes, was paramount.

50|$|Yermak’s {{life and}} conquests had a {{significant}} impact on Russian policy towards Siberia and the colonization attempts that followed this shift. Prior to Yermak’s agreement with the Strogonovs, the Russian attitude towards the Siberian expanse had been one preoccupied primarily with defense, not aggression. The top priority was the repelling of the Tatar hordes, and, as shown by Ivan’s letter to the Strogonovs, the central government rarely involved itself unless the tribes succeeded in entering Russian territory. This, of course, changed with Yermak, whose triumphs showed that the Tatars could be put on the defensive and that Russia could now establish itself as an aggressive power in the East. Yermak also changed the involvement of the tsar in Siberian affairs. In reaching out to the tsar for assistance, Yermak gained the support of the government; indeed, it was reinforcements from the tsar that solidified the Russian presence in the region immediately after Yermak’s death. This newfound commitment and involvement in the area is best summarized by Ivan’s <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>title</b> bestowed upon him by Yermak: “Tsar of Sibir.” Yermak’s pioneering further enabled this system to exist because it depended on the success he achieved in gaining tribute from conquered peoples. Much like Yermak, future troops were sent with the understanding that it would be necessary to supplement their base payment with treasures and tributes gained from conquest. Without this system in place, it is unlikely such an arrangement would have come to fruition.|$|R

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{electronic}} books (e-books) has significantly impacted {{the publishing industry}} in recent years. The prevalence of e-books has prompted many publishers to reconsider their distribution channels for new titles. They need {{to decide whether to}} sell the e-book version <b>of</b> new <b>titles.</b> We derive the conditions under which a publisher should sell only printed books (p-books), only e-books, and both of them simultaneously. We analyze the impact <b>of</b> reader <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> e-book and the wholesale price of the counterpart p-book on the distribution channel choice of the publisher under stochastic demand. We find that only if wholesale price of p-book is high and reader <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> e-book is low should the publisher sell only p-books; otherwise, he should sell e-books, even when reader <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> e-book is low, i. e., in most cases the publisher should sell e-books (perhaps selling p-books simultaneously). In general, the higher the reader <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> e-book is, the more the publisher tends to sell the e-book to readers directly. However, our analysis also shows that even when reader <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> e-book is very high, the publisher does not necessarily sell only e-books. The wholesale price reflects the publisher's power of negotiation over bookstores. The higher the publisher's power of negotiation over bookstores is, the more he is inclined to sell p-books; and when reader <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> e-book is relatively high, the lower the publisher's power of negotiation is, the more he tends to sell only e-books.
