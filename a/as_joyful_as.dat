Sir Thomas was <b>as</b> <b>joyful</b> <b>as</b> she could desire, and very kind and communicative; and she had so comfortable a talk with him about William as to make her feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her, till she found, towards the close, that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and dine there that very day.

40|$|Objective: Positive and {{negative}} affect {{are the two}} psychobiological-dispositional dimensions reflecting proneness to positive {{and negative}} activation that influence {{the extent to which}} individuals experience life events <b>as</b> <b>joyful</b> or <b>as</b> distressful. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a structured questionnaire that provides independent indexes of positive and negative affect. This study aimed to validate a Brazilian interview-version of the PANAS by means of factor and internal consistency analysis. Methods: A representative community sample of 3, 728 individuals residing in the cities of S&# 227;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, voluntarily completed the PANAS. Exploratory structural equation model analysis was based on maximum likelihood estimation and reliability was calculated via Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Results: Our results provide support for the hypothesis that the PANAS reliably measures two distinct dimensions of positive and negative affect. Conclusion: The structure and reliability of the Brazilian version of the PANAS are consistent with those of its original version. Taken together, these results attest the validity of the Brazilian adaptation of the instrument...|$|R

50|$|Words not chanted in Orthodox worship are sung by a choir. Originally singing {{was done}} by the entire congregation, however this rapidly became {{cumbersome}} and a select group of singers was selected to represent the congregation. Since then Orthodox church music has expanded and become more elaborate. The Church uses eight 'tones' or 'modes,' which are broad categories of melodies. Within each of these tones are many small more precise melodies. All of these tones and their melodies rotate weekly so that during each week a particular tone is used for singing music. Singing naturally developed from chanting but, unlike in the west, Orthodox music developed from a Greek musical background. Even though Orthodoxy has spread and its music adapted to its various regions, still Orthodox music is distinctive from European music. Singing is used in place of chanting on important occasions thus some things which are chanted at minor services are sung at more important services. Singing is as varied and multi-faceted in its forms as chanting and vestments, it changes with the Church 'seasons' of commemoration thus singing during Great Lent is always somber and during Holy Week nearly becomes a sorrowful dirge while during Pascha (Easter) and the Paschal season the notes are high and quick and <b>as</b> <b>joyful</b> <b>as</b> they were sad during Lent. The power of music is not lost on the Orthodox and it is used to its full effect to bring about spiritual renewal in the listeners.|$|E

40|$|Many read The Fox from Up Above and the Fox from Down Below, by José María Arguedas, as {{a tragic}} {{expression}} of the breaking-point of Andean myth. Others, while recognizing a tragic dimension to the novel, also see a joyous one that they associate {{with the hope that}} myth and modernity could come together to form a harmonious new society. This article argues for a reading of the novel <b>as</b> <b>joyful</b> <b>as</b> well as tragic, taking distance from most understandings of the novel's ‘hopeful’ dimension in arguing that both joy and suffering, together, are expressions of the novel's profoundly modern intervention in and opening up of history. I examine the passage in which the fox-human Diego joyously ‘dances the machines’ in don Ángel's factory in order to discuss how the modernity of the novel is related to this affect where joy and suffering are one, showing that it is at the level of joy-suffering that the novel is able to open up a space of indistinctness that has the potential to generate a radically new community no longer based upon the logic of identity and difference...|$|E
40|$|Shalom Auslander and Gary Shteyngart {{are two of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} new voices to have emerged in Jewish-American fiction in the 21 st century. In addition to their fiction, they have both published memoirs—Auslander’s Foreskin’s Lament (2007) and Shteyngart’s Little Failure (2014) —that follow the narrative trajectory of Bildungsromane and are, as their titles suggest, characterised by a self-satirising, self-incriminating comedy. In this article, I will argue that this comedy emerges from an intertextual dialogue with the work of Philip Roth, so that we might call Shteyngart and Auslander—adapting the ‘Sons of Ben’ label given to a generation of Caroline authors who regarded themselves as disciples of the Renaissance poet and playwright Ben Jonson—‘sons of Phil’. Tracing the affinities between the work of the two writers and that of Roth, I argue that their ‘works of semi-autobiography’ cannot be accommodated in the redemptive, ethical model of Jewish fiction that has been proposed by a number of recent critics, but rather are animated by the paradoxically self-fulfilling and self-abasing impulse identified by Shteyngart: ‘I write because there is nothing <b>as</b> <b>joyful</b> <b>as</b> writing, even when the writing is twisted and full of hate, the self-hate that makes writing not only possible but necessary’ (Shteyngart, 2014 : 148) ...|$|E

40|$|African-Americans {{fled the}} United States of America {{during the nineteenth}} century to escape slavery. The {{majority}} of the emigrants took refuge in Upper Canada. Slavery had been abolished by 1834 in all British colonial possessions. Blacks were promised protection from racism by virtue of British institutions. Upper Canada offered the fugitives a chance to begin a new life. Life in Canada West was not to be <b>as</b> <b>joyful</b> <b>as</b> was promised. When Blacks arrived in the British colony they were treated as outsiders, outcast from society. The prejudices of the day flourished throughout the countryside. Racism was manifested in the refusal of local administrators to allow African-American children to attend government financed schools. The settlers were not prepared to abandon their long held fear of Blacks and they prevented the integration of children of all races. The administration did not offer support and protection from intolerance. The education system failed Black children by not allowing them to attend classes even though their parents paid their school taxes. The British establishment recognized the injustice and tried to remedy the situation by opening schools of their own. The Colonial Church and School Society opened a school in London, Canada West. The Anglican missionaries wanted to prove that Blacks could be educated and become part of society. The aims of the founder of the school, Rev. M. M. Dillon, differed from the aims of the CCSS. He wanted to have Blacks and whites educated together to their mutual benefit. His participation in the founding and running of the Mission is central to the operation of the Mission to the Fugitive Slaves of Canada West. He did not maintain the support of the influential members of the London society and was removed from his post. The point of contention was that he had allowed more whites in the school than Black children. He left the Mission in 1856 and the Mission closed in 1858...|$|E
