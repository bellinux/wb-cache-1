5|$|The Manhattan Project {{became public}} {{knowledge}} after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Oppenheimer {{became a national}} spokesman for science who was emblematic of {{a new type of}} technocratic power.

Nuclear physics became a powerful force as all governments of the world began to realize the strategic and political power that came with nuclear weapons. Like many scientists of his generation, he felt that security from atomic bombs would come only from a transnational organization such as the newly formed United Nations, which could institute a program to stifle a nuclear arms race.|$|E

5|$|Ball {{then took}} leave in England. His feats in France had {{received}} considerable publicity. He {{was the first}} British ace to become <b>a</b> <b>household</b> <b>name,</b> and found that his celebrity was such {{that he could not}} walk down the streets of Nottingham without being stopped and congratulated. Prior to this the British government had suppressed the names of its aces—in contrast to the policy of the French and Germans—but the losses of the Battle of the Somme, which had commenced in July, made politic the publicising of its successes in the air. Ball's achievements {{had a profound impact on}} budding flyer Mick Mannock, who would become the United Kingdom's top-scoring ace and also receive the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|In 1896 he {{was first}} {{appointed}} consul and later consul general for the Orange Free State.

50|$|The {{growth and}} success of the Goldmann {{publishing}} house in Leipzig was mainly based {{on the success of}} Zischka's bestsellers which are different from, for instance, :de:Karl Aloys Schenzinger, a more fictional Raw Material bestseller written during the Third Reich. Zischka remained in Spain (and staunchly adhered to non-fiction) and found international praise as well. Zischka finally found (after some vain efforts) a sponsor within the Nazi elite, Fritz Todt. The latter introduced Wissenschaft bricht Monopole (1936) as text book in secondary schools and made Zischka <b>an</b> <b>household</b> <b>name</b> within the regime. The book was translated in 18 languages and sold worldwide.|$|R
5|$|This garment {{instantly}} received significant global media coverage, and {{has been}} cited along with Elizabeth Hurley's black Versace dress {{as one of the}} most high-profile dresses that made the designer Versace <b>a</b> <b>household</b> <b>name.</b> In addition, this dress was described as a turning point in designer Donatella Versace's career after the death of her brother Gianni Versace. It was chosen by the fashion journalist Lisa Armstrong to represent 2000 in the Fashion Museum of Bath's Dress of the Year collection, at which point it was described as a key example of the close relationship between fashions, celebrities and publicity. Another duplicate is displayed at The Grammy Museum while as of 2015, Lopez still owns the original gown. In 2015, fifteen years since Lopez first wore it, the dress is still inextricably associated with her and Versace.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the elder Joseph Terry's death in 1850, Terry's was {{becoming}} <b>a</b> <b>household</b> <b>name</b> due to its previous trade successes across the country. The younger Joseph, along with his two brothers, Robert and John, are credited with moving confectionery production to an industrial scale with the leasing of a factory at Clementhorpe, beside the River Ouse, in 1862. Its location was particularly advantageous, as the 22-year-old Terry had drawn inspiration from the manipulation of the railways initiated by his father, and saw the benefit of importing and exporting from the river using steamboats. Vessels from the River Humber supplied coal for the factory, while larger ships would import ingredients such as sugar and cocoa from around the world twice a week. The Clementhorpe factory also improved the logistics of the company, providing ample room for the construction of warehouses to store stock. Two years later, there were 400 separate items in the firm's price list, with around 13 of them consisting of chocolate as a main ingredient; others included various candied peels, cakes, biscuits and jams among other more exotic products such as cream balls.|$|E
5|$|Evans was {{a visionary}} who {{produced}} designs and ideas {{far ahead of}} their time. He {{was the first to}} describe vapor-compression refrigeration and propose a design for the first refrigerator in 1805, but it would be three decades until his colleague Jacob Perkins would be able to construct a working example. Similarly, he drew up designs for a solar boiler, machine gun, steam-carriage gearshift, dough-kneading machine, perpetual baking oven, marine salvage process, quadruple-effect evaporator, and a scheme for urban gas lighting, ideas and designs which would not be made reality until some time after his death. Evans had influential backers and political allies, but lacked social graces and was disliked by many of his peers. Disappointed and then angry at the perceived lack of recognition for his contributions, Evans became combative and bitter in later years, which damaged his reputation and left him isolated. Despite the importance of his work, his contributions were frequently overlooked (or attributed to others after his death) so he never became <b>a</b> <b>household</b> <b>name</b> alongside the other steam pioneers of his era.|$|E

5|$|Its royal {{occupant}} {{may very}} well have made York House the pinnacle of Brettingham's career. Built during the 1760s, it was one of his last grand houses. His last country-house commission was at Packington Hall, Warwickshire. In 1761, he published his plans of Holkham Hall, calling himself the architect, which led critics, including Horace Walpole, to decry him as a purloiner of Kent's designs. Brettingham died in 1769 at his house outside St. Augustine's Gate, Norwich, and was buried in the aisle of the parish church. Throughout his long career, Brettingham did much to popularise the Palladian movement. His clients included a Royal Duke and at least twenty-one assorted peers and peeresses. He is not <b>a</b> <b>household</b> <b>name</b> today largely because his provincial work was heavily influenced by Kent and Burlington, and unlike his contemporary Giacomo Leoni he did not develop, or was not given the opportunity to develop, a strong personal stamp to his work on country houses. Ultimately, he and many of his contemporary architects were eclipsed by the designs of Robert Adam. Adam remodelled Brettingham's York House in 1780 and, in addition to Kedleston Hall, went on to replace James Paine as architect at Nostell Priory, Alnwick Castle, and Syon House. In spite of this, Adam and Paine remained great friends; Brettingham's relationships with his fellow architects are unrecorded.|$|E
