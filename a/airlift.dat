5|$|By 17 February, the Khmer Republic {{abandoned}} {{attempts to}} reopen the Mekong supply line. In future, all supplies for Phnom Penh {{would have to come}} in by air to Pochentong Airport. The United States quickly mobilised an <b>airlift</b> of food, fuel and ammunition into Phnom Penh, but as US support for the Khmer Republic was limited by the Case–Church Amendment, BirdAir, a company under contract to the US Government, controlled the <b>airlift</b> with a mixed fleet of C-130 and DC-8 planes, flying 20 times a day into Pochentong.|$|E

5|$|On June 24, 1948, the Soviet Union blocked {{access to}} the three Western-held sectors of Berlin. The Allies had not {{negotiated}} a deal to guarantee supply of the sectors deep within the Soviet-occupied zone. The commander of the American occupation zone in Germany, General Lucius D. Clay, proposed sending a large armored column across the Soviet zone to West Berlin with instructions to defend itself if it were stopped or attacked. Truman believed this would entail an unacceptable risk of war. He approved Ernest Bevin's plan to supply the blockaded city by air. On June 25, the Allies initiated the Berlin <b>Airlift,</b> a campaign to deliver food, coal and other supplies using military aircraft on a massive scale. Nothing like it had ever been attempted before, and no single nation had the capability, either logistically or materially, to accomplish it. The <b>airlift</b> worked; ground access was again granted on May 11, 1949. Nevertheless, the <b>airlift</b> continued for several months after that. The Berlin <b>Airlift</b> was one of Truman's great foreign policy successes; it significantly aided his election campaign in 1948.|$|E

5|$|The daily {{rail and}} water Red Ball Express from Yokohama to Sasebo to Pusan began on July 23. By August it was {{operating}} with increased efficiency, demonstrating {{that it could}} promptly deliver any supplies available in Japan to Korea. On August 5, for example, it delivered 308tonnes; on August 9, 403tonnes; on August 22, 574tonnes; and on August 25, 949tonnes. The success of the Red Ball Express cut down the amount of <b>airlift</b> tonnage. This fell from 85tonnes on July 31 to 49tonnes on August 6. The express eliminated the need for nearly all <b>airlift</b> of supplies to Korea from Japan. It delivered supplies to Korea in an average time of 60–70 hours, while the <b>airlift</b> delivery varied from 12 hours to 5 days. The Red Ball delivery was not only more cost effective, it was more consistent and reliable.|$|E
5|$|An {{emergency}} <b>airlift</b> of critically needed items began {{almost immediately}} from the United States to the Far East. The Military Air Transport Service (MATS), Pacific Division, expanded rapidly after {{the outbreak of}} the war. The Pacific <b>airlift</b> was further expanded by the charter of civil airlines planes. The Canadian Government lent the United Nations a Royal Canadian Air Force squadron of six transports, while the Belgian Government added several DC-4s to the effort. Altogether, the fleet of about 60 four-engine transport planes operating across the Pacific before June 25, 1950, was quickly expanded to approximately 250. In addition to these, there were MATS C-74 Globemaster and C-97 Stratofreighter planes operating between the United States and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The drop in air {{delivery}} to Korea caused Major General Earle E. Partridge, commanding the Far East Air Forces, to complain on August 10 that the Army was not fully using the airlift's 200 tonne daily capacity. That day, Eighth Army ordered curtailment of delivery by the Red Ball Express and {{increased use of}} the <b>airlift</b> to its maximum capacity. The reason given for this action was a sudden apprehension that the port of Pusan could not process the flow of water-borne supplies in a timely manner. The next day, upon Partridge's suggestion, two 2½-ton trucks were airlifted in a C-119 from Tachikawa Air Base in Japan to Taegu. The Air Force planned to <b>airlift</b> two trucks daily in this manner. As a result, on August 12, Eighth Army ordered the Red Ball Express be discontinued August 15 except on Tuesday and Friday of each week when it would carry cargo that was considered too difficult for the planes to handle. Under this arrangement <b>airlift</b> tonnage greatly increased. On August 16, transport planes carried 324tonnes of cargo and 595 passengers; on August 19, 160tonnes of cargo and 381 passengers; on 28 August, 398tonnes of cargo and 343 passengers; and, on August 29, 326tonnes of cargo and 347 passengers.|$|E

5|$|At 03:58, C-130E, #72-1297, {{flown by}} a crew from the 776th Tactical <b>Airlift</b> Squadron, was {{destroyed}} by a 122mm rocket while taxiing to pick up refugees after offloading a BLU-82 at Tan Son Nhut Air Base. The crew evacuated the burning aircraft on the taxiway and departed the airfield on another C-130 that had previously landed. This was the last USAF fixed-wing aircraft to leave Tan Son Nhut. Between 04:30 and 08:00 up to 40 artillery rounds and rockets hit around the DAO Compound.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the Somali Civil War {{drew the}} world's attention.

Cheney's successors as Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin and William J. Perry, had to contend with both the Bosnian and Somali issues.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Army of Africa {{crossed the}} Gibraltar Strait, using Junkers Ju 52 {{transport}} planes provided by Nazi Germany, without any loyalist Air Force interference {{owing to the}} confusion and lack of decision of the Spanish Republican side. The massive <b>airlift</b> of troops from Spanish Morocco was the world's first long-range combat <b>airlift</b> and it allowed Franco's troops to join General Queipo de Llano's forces in Seville. Their quick movement allowed them to meet General Mola's Northern Army and secure most of northern and northwestern Spain, as well as central and western Andalusia. The Republican Government ended up with controlling {{almost all of the}} Eastern Spanish coast and central area around Madrid, as well as Asturias, Cantabria and part of the Basque Country in the north. Mola was keen {{to create a sense of}} fear within Nationalist-controlled areas. There was a massive purge of freemasons, and a wide part of the left, including some moderate socialists.|$|E
5|$|No. 37 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) medium {{tactical}} <b>airlift</b> squadron. It operates Lockheed Martin C-130J Hercules aircraft from RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales.

It has also supported Australian humanitarian and peacekeeping operations around the world, including in Somalia, East Timor, Bali, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 2003, 954 {{soldiers}} of the 173d Airborne Brigade conducted a combat jump from C-17 aircraft onto Bashur Airfield in Northern Iraq {{under the command of}} Colonel Mayville. The jump took a total of 58seconds, though 32 paratroopers were unable to jump because they would have landed too far {{from the rest of the}} force. The force had been strung out over a 10,000-yard drop zone, and it took 15 hours before it was completely assembled. In the weeks before there had been heavy rain and the mud created problems for those doing the jump. The paratroopers secured the airfield, allowing the C-17s to land and bring in the heavy armor and the 1–63d Armor contingents. They jumped from aircraft of the 62d <b>Airlift</b> Wing and the 728th <b>Airlift</b> Squadron, along with an element of USAF Airmen from the 786th Security Forces Squadron. Over the next 96 hours, the wing landed in the remaining 1,200 {{soldiers of}} the brigade as well as their vehicles. By 29 March the entire brigade was in Iraq and ready to conduct offensive operations.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Department of Defense {{responded by}} {{accelerating}} its Rapid Deployment Forces concept but suffered from major problems with <b>airlift</b> and sealift capability.
