40|$|Background: Photodermatitis is an {{abnormal}} response to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). The photoallergic contact dermatitis caused by plant allergens {{is a serious}} cause of morbidity in India. <b>Airborne</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> is the classical presentation of plant-induced dermatosis, which may become difficult to differentiate from chronic actinic dermatitis in chronic cases. The rapid growth of parthenium weed in India and its ill effects on the population make it important to detect all cases of parthenium sensitivity, which in some cases might simulate photodermatitis. Aims: This study aims to detect the occurrence of plant sensitivity and photosensitivity in idiopathic-acquired photodermatoses, <b>airborne</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and general population taken as controls. Methods: One hundred and fifty six consecutive patients suffering from polymorphic light eruption (PMLE), chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD) and <b>airborne</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (ABCD) {{were enrolled in the}} study over a period of three years (June 2004 to May 2007). An equal number of age and sex matched healthy subjects were enrolled in the study as controls. All the patients were subjected to detailed history taking, clinical examination and histopathological examination for diagnosis. Patch and photopatch testing were perfomed in all the patients and healthy controls for detection of allergic and photoallergic reactions to parthenium, xanthium and chrysanthemum plant antigens and control antigens. Results: Out of 156 patients enrolled in the study, 78 (50 &#x 0025;) had CAD, 67 (42. 9 &#x 0025;) had PMLE and 11 (7. 05 &#x 0025;) had ABCD. The occurrence of parthenium/xanthium allergy and photoallergy, either to parthenium or both was most commonly found in ABCD (72. 7 &#x 0025;), followed by CAD (32 &#x 0025;). In PMLE 4. 5 &#x 0025; cases showed photoallergy. Only 1. 9 &#x 0025; in the control group showed sensitivity to parthenium and xanthium. Conclusion: This study indicates that parthenium (and possibly xanthium) may act as important environmental factors in the initiation and perpetuation of not only ABCD but of CAD as well. Photoexacerbation to UVA at positive parthenium/xanthium sensitivity sites in ABCD and CAD indicates that ABCD with photosensitivity to compositae can lead to CAD...|$|E

40|$|Background: Parthenium hysterophorus is the commonest {{cause of}} <b>airborne</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in India. Azathioprine {{has been shown}} to be {{effective}} and safe in parthenium dermatitis, but there are no reports of comparison of steroids and azathioprine in this condition. Aims: To study the therapeutic efficacy of azathioprine versus betamethasone in patients having contact dermatitis to parthenium and compare the side effects of the drugs. Methods: Fifty-five patients of <b>airborne</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> to parthenium were randomly assigned to treatment with azathioprine 100 mg daily (group A) or betamethasone 2 mg daily (group B), for 6 months in a blinded manner. The patients were evaluated every month for 6 months to determine the response to treatment and side effects and then further followed up for another 6 months to determine any relapse. Results: There were 26 patients in group A and 29 in group B, of which 20 patients of group A and 21 of group B completed the study. Nineteen (95 &#x 0025;) patients in group A and all 21 (100 &#x 0025;) patients in group B had an excellent response (complete remission) to treatment (P = 0. 0156 vs. 0. 0005).

To investigate {{the prevalence of}} occupational allergic contact dermatitis (OACD) and to identify the causative allergens among clothing employees in China, a cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 529 clothing employees at 12 clothing factories in Beijing. All employees were subjected to an interview using self-administered questionnaire and skin examination, and those who were diagnosed with occupational contact dermatitis (OCD) were patch tested. In the present survey, we found that the overall 1 -year prevalence of OACD among the clothing employees was 8. 5 %. The 1 -year prevalence of OACD among workers (10. 8 %) was significantly higher than that among managers (3. 2 %). The lesions were primarily on the hands and wrists in workers, but the face and neck in managers.

40|$|Background: Parthenium {{dermatitis}} is {{the most}} common type of <b>airborne</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in India. It is a chronic disease of a remitting and relapsing course with significant morbidity and distress, but there is no scoring system to assess its severity. Aim: To design a scoring system for the assessment of clinical severity of disease in Parthenium dermatitis and to use this scoring system in various studies to determine its sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. Methods and Results: In our first few studies on Parthenium dermatitis, we designed and used a basic clinical severity scoring system based on itching, morphology of the lesions, and areas involved. However, in subsequent studies, we modified it to the present scoring system as Parthenium dermatitis severity score (PDSS). Our studies showed the high sensitivity of PDSS in characterization of the disease severity at the given point of time, as well as to determine the efficacy of a prescribed treatment modality which was reliable and reproducible.

In India, there are various indigenous and foreign plants that are well known to cause dermatitis, Parthenium hysterophorus being the foremost. Aims of the Study: To study the clinical features of patients presenting with plant dermatitis and evaluate plant allergen series patch test results. Materials and Methods: 50 patients with suspected plant dermatitis were evaluated regarding evolution of dermatitis, precipitating factors and contact with various plants. 31 patients (62 %) complained of photo sensitivity and 24 (48 %) had involvement of sun-exposed areas. Our provisional diagnoses included allergic contact dermatitis in 16, air borne contact dermatitis in 9, phytophotodermatitis in 7, photodermatitis in 6, <b>airborne</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> to other causes in 4, phytodermatitis in 3.

Skin biopsies from allergic (13 cases) and sodium lauryl sulfate-induced irritant patch test reactions (13 cases), obtained 1 – 72 [*]h after patch testing, were studied {{by means of an}} in situ hybridization technique. Results of chemokine mRNA expression were correlated with clinical scoring, histology, and immunohistochemical data including the proportion of inflammatory cells expressing CXCR 3, the receptor for IP- 10, Mig, and IP- 9, and ICAM- 1 and HLA-DR expression on keratinocytes. IP- 10, Mig, and IP- 9 mRNA were detected in seven of nine allergic <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> reactions after 24 – 72 [*]h, but not in sodium lauryl sulfate-induced irritant <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> reactions.
