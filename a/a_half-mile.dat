5|$|Every year, Florida averages 10 {{deaths and}} 30 {{injuries}} from lightning strikes, {{with several of}} these usually occurring in or around Tampa. University of Florida lightning expert Martin A. Uman has calculated that the average resident is within <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> of 10 to 15 lightning strikes every year. TECO Energy, the local electric utility, spends over USD $1,000,000 annually to repair transformers and other equipment damaged by lightning strikes.|$|E
5|$|NY167 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US20 (West Main Street) near {{the northern tip of}} Canadarago Lake {{in the village}} of Richfield Springs. The route proceeds north as a two-lane highway along Church Street, passing through the village's residential northern portion before leaving Richfield Springs and crossing the Otsegoâ€“Herkimer county line just <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> (0.8km) from the junction with US20. The residential surroundings follow NY167 into the town of Warren; however, they give way to more open, undeveloped areas as the route intersects Millstone Road (County Route78 or CR78, an unsigned number) about <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> (0.8km) from the county line. From Millstone Road, the route winds northeast through Warren, traveling through increasingly rural areas as it serves the hamlet of Cullen and intersects Cullen and Hogsback roads (CR183) {{in the center of the}} small community.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} able to {{continue}} the streak despite {{the death of one}} of its members. Jim McGee, Frank McGee's brother, died after the 1904 season in a horseback riding accident. He was also the Ottawa Football Club's captain at the time. The funeral cortege was estimated at <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> in length, and it included Canadian prime minister Wilfrid Laurier.|$|E

5|$|A mile {{south of}} the airport, at a signalized {{intersection}} with Old State Route 82, the road divides. Highway 82 turns eastward again, returning to its southerly heading after another mile when Spring Valley Road turns off to the Glenwood Springs campus of Colorado Mountain College in {{the mountains to the}} north. <b>A</b> <b>half-mile</b> (1km) beyond that junction, at the headquarters of the Garfield County Road and Bridge District, the highway begins a long stretch with a southerly heading.|$|E
5|$|Boston's {{park system}} is well-reputed nationally. In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land {{reported}} that Boston {{was tied with}} Sacramento and San Francisco for having the third-best park system among the 50 most populous US cities. ParkScore ranks city park systems by a formula that analyzes the city's median park size, park acres as percent of city area, the percent of residents within <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> of a park, spending of park services per resident, {{and the number of}} playgrounds per 10,000 residents.|$|E
5|$|Farther east, {{the road}} {{passes through the}} hamlets of Gardiner and Clintondale, and meets US9W in the hamlet of Highland. Just inside of Gardiner, the highway passes through Minnewaska State Park, a large state park in the Hudson Valley. US44 and NY55 join US9W for roughly <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> southward along the western bank of the Hudson River before {{separating}} at a trumpet interchange south of Highland. One mile east of US9W, US44 and NY55 cross the Hudson on the Mid-Hudson Bridge.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, a new {{interchange}} {{was built}} between NY134 and the Taconic State Parkway {{as part of}} the construction of IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center. During the excavation process for the junction, a bone from a woolly mammoth (colloquially known as Jefferson's mammoth) was found buried in the earth below. The bones were moved to the New York State Museum in Albany. The construction also required the relocation of the Kitchawan Tavern from the site of the exit to the junction of Kitchawan and Chadeanye roads <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> (0.8km) to the east.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Beach's {{extensive}} {{park system}} {{is recognized as}} one of the best in the United States. In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land reported that Virginia Beach had the 8th best park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities. ParkScore ranks city park systems by a formula that analyzes the city's median park size, park acres as percent of city area, the percent of city residents within <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> of a park, spending of park services per resident, and the number of playgrounds per 10,000 residents.|$|E
5|$|In Harrison, NY120 passes several mansions on {{both sides}} of the highway as it {{gradually}} turns northwestward and approaches I-287 (the Cross Westchester Expressway). The route parallels the western edge of the freeway for several blocks to Westchester Avenue, where NY120 meets the southern end of NY120A, an alternate route through the easternmost part of Westchester County. While NY120A heads east toward Port Chester, NY120 takes on the Westchester Avenue name as the two directions of the route split to follow collector/distributor roads running northwestward along both sides of I-287. The route remains on the frontage roads for about <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> (0.8km) to another section of Purchase Street, where NY120 turns to follow a slightly more northward track through another residential section of Harrison.|$|E
50|$|Georgetown Speedway {{features}} <b>a</b> fast, <b>half-mile</b> clay oval {{that produces}} high speeds and thrilling racing action. The facility has spacious grandstands, ample parking, a large, flat pit area, room for overnight camping and more.|$|R

5|$|Mario and Aldo were {{surprised}} to find <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> dirt racing track when they moved to Nazareth. The twins worked on a 1948 Hudson Commodore modified funded by money that they earned in their uncle's garage in 1959. They took turns racing the old Hudson on oval dirt tracks near Nazareth in 1959. They did not tell their parents that they were racing. The twins each had two wins after their first four races. Aldo was seriously hurt {{near the end of}} the season, and their parents were unhappy to find out that the twins were racing. Mario had 21 modified stockcar wins in 46 races in 1960 and 1961.|$|E
5|$|NY335 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Feura Bush Road {{southeast of the}} hamlet of Delmar {{in the town of}} Bethlehem. Although Feura Bush Road is now NY910A, an unsigned reference route, it was once part of NY32. From Feura Bush Road, NY335 heads northward as a two-lane street named Elsmere Avenue, passing several housing tracts in an otherwise open area of the town. After <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> (0.8km), the route meets the Delmar Bypass, a four-lane divided highway carrying NY32 through Bethlehem. Past the bypass, NY335 traverses dense residential neighborhoods {{on its way to the}} hamlet of Elsmere, one of several communities located along NY443.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Castorland, {{the road}} runs across <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> (0.8km) stretch of undeveloped land prior to {{crossing}} the Black River, {{which serves as}} {{the boundary between the}} towns of Denmark and Croghan. On the opposite riverbank, NY410 continues across another open stretch to reach the small hamlet of Naumburg. Here, the route passes a handful of homes and intersects the north end of CR33 (Van Amber Road) before ending at an intersection with NY126 on the northeastern fringe of the hamlet. While NY410 terminates at this junction, its right-of-way continues past NY126 as Cross Road, a local highway connecting Naumburg to CR8 (Second Road).|$|E
50|$|A visitor center, {{restroom}} and bookstore, {{operated by}} the Forest Service and the Arizona Natural History Association, is located on site. The fenced petroglyph site is <b>an</b> easy <b>half-mile</b> walk from the parking lot. For most of the year, there is a resident on-site custodian.|$|R
50|$|Leicestershire, Warwickshire, and Staffordshire meet about 0.5 mi {{northwest}} of the village. Derbyshire, Leicestershire, and Staffordshire meet <b>a</b> further <b>half-mile</b> northwest. There is an ancient (probably Mercian) stone, divided into four parts, which may mark {{the point where the}} four counties met before boundary adjustments.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} I stood irresolute. I had a {{momentary}} idea of jumping overboard and swimming for liberty. But land {{could be seen}} fully <b>a</b> good <b>half-mile</b> away, and no vessels of consequence were near, so I was forced to give such a course up.|$|R
5|$|Past the exit, the Sagtikos State Parkway crosses under CR13 and {{immediately}} enters exitS1, a large modified cloverleaf interchange with the Long Island Expressway (Interstate495 or I-495). The junction brings the parkway {{into the town}} of Smithtown, where it bends northwestward and parallels CR67 (Vanderbilt Motor Parkway) for <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> (0.8km) through the town's Commack section. CR67 eventually turns westward to pass under the Sagtikos Parkway, {{at which point the}} parkway curves back to the north and enters exitSM1E, a cloverleaf interchange serving as the Northern State Parkway's exit44. The Sagtikos State Parkway name ends here while the highway continues northward toward Long Island's North Shore as the Sunken Meadow State Parkway.|$|E
5|$|Timberlake's party left Long Island on November 28, 1761. The Holston River's unusually {{low water}} levels almost {{immediately}} stalled the journey, {{as the party}} was forced to drag their canoe over exposed shoals and sandbars. The party ran out of provisions after several days, but McCormack managed to shoot a bear, supplying them with several days' worth of meat. Around December 7, the party explored a stalactite-filled cave situated approximately 50 feet above the river. Timberlake described an incident in which Sumter swam nearly <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> in the near-freezing river waters to retrieve their canoe, which had somehow drifted away while they were exploring the cave.|$|E
5|$|Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division, from Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's Third Corps, {{advanced}} towards Gettysburg. Heth deployed no cavalry and led, unconventionally, {{with the}} artillery battalion of Major William J. Pegram. Two infantry brigades followed, commanded by Brig. Gens. James J. Archer and Joseph R. Davis, proceeding easterly in columns along the Chambersburg Pike. Three miles (5km) west of town, about 7:30 a.m., Heth's two brigades met light resistance from cavalry vedettes and deployed into line. Eventually, they reached dismounted troopers from Col. William Gamble's cavalry brigade. The first {{shot of the}} battle was claimed to be fired by Lieutenant Marcellus E. Jones of the 8th Illinois Cavalry, fired at an unidentified man on a gray horse over <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> away; the act was merely symbolic. Buford's 2,748 troopers would soon be faced with 7,600 Confederate infantrymen, deploying from columns into line of battle.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>a</b> good <b>half-mile</b> to {{the next}} body of woods, and midway there {{was one of those}} sidings where a sleigh {{approaching}} from the other quarter must turn out and yield the right of way. Bartley stopped his colt, and scanned the road.|$|R
25|$|The castle is {{approached}} by <b>a</b> modern <b>half-mile</b> long wooded drive that runs alongside the original drive which is visible as an earthwork {{in the adjacent}} woods. The main carpark is in the quarry that {{was the source of}} much of the slate used for the Pomeroy buildings.|$|R
50|$|The Autobahn {{full track}} is 3.56 miles in distance. The full track can be {{split into two}} smaller tracks. The south track is {{much larger than the}} north.

5|$|East of Brooks Avenue, NY33A {{passes through}} a small {{residential}} area before entering a more industrial neighborhood surrounding the Erie Canal and the Rochester city line. In the western portion of this area, the route meets I-390 at exit19 and intersects Buell Road (County Route162), which directly links NY33A to the airport <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> (0.8km) to the south. East of I-390, NY33A crosses the Erie Canal and enters the city of Rochester, at which point maintenance of NY33A shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{to the city of}} Rochester. On the northern bank of the waterway, the route passes under the Rochester and Southern Railroad. The surroundings become significantly more residential east of the railroad as the route heads northeastward toward downtown Rochester. However, NY33A ends roughly one mile (1.6km) west of downtown at a junction with NY33 (West Avenue). Here, Chili and West Avenues converge and NY33 continues toward downtown as West Main Street.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of Avon, West Main feeds into Park Place, a large traffic circle {{providing}} access to two local streets from US20 and NY5. The routes follow the circle counterclockwise, departing the roundabout on East Main Street. The street proceeds east, passing through four blocks of densely populated neighborhoods before exiting the village and abruptly entering vast, barren fields to the east. US20 and NY5, now named Avonâ€“Lima Road, intersects NY15 two miles (3km) to the east in East Avon, a community based around the intersection and the streets comprising it, and connects to I-390 at exit10 <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> from NY15. Continuing on, the road intersects a number of county routes {{over the next four}} miles (6km) before becoming West Main Street once more, this time for the village of Lima. At an intersection with NY15A in the village center, US20 and NY5 become East Main Street, retaining the name to the Ontario County line at Honeoye Creek.|$|E
5|$|In early 1925, Nurmi {{embarked}} on a widely publicised tour of the United States. He competed in 55 events (45 indoors) during a five-month period, starting at a sold-out Madison Square Garden on 6 January. His debut was {{a copy of his}} feats in Helsinki and Paris. Nurmi defeated Joie Ray and Lloyd Hahn to win the mile and Ritola to win the 5000 m, again setting new world records for both distances. Nurmi broke ten more indoor world records in regular events and set several new best times for rarer distances. He won 51 of the events, abandoned one race and lost two handicap races along with his final event; <b>a</b> <b>half-mile</b> race at the Yankee Stadium, where he finished second to American track star Alan Helffrich. Helffrich's victory ended Nurmi's 121-race, four-year win streak in individual scratch races at distances from 800 m upwards. Although he hated losing more than anything, Nurmi was the first to congratulate Helffrich. The tour made Nurmi extremely popular in the United States, and the Finn agreed to meet President Calvin Coolidge at the White House. Nurmi left America fearing that he had competed too often and burned himself out.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, <b>a</b> {{short-lived}} <b>half-mile</b> branch line led from Sharon Heights to a summer-only station at Lake Massapoag. The branch {{was also used}} to haul ice from the lake to surrounding locales. The remnants of the wye to the branch are still visible from passing trains on the main line.|$|R
50|$|Constructed in {{the late}} 1920s as <b>a</b> flat <b>half-mile</b> dirt oval, the Jenners Fairgrounds, as the {{speedway}} was then known, played host to â€˜big carâ€™ racing (forerunners to the sprint cars of today) during the 1930s. Among the leading local drivers of that era were Butch Gardner and the â€˜Pennsylvania coal minerâ€™, Mike (Little) Serokman.|$|R
60|$|It chanced {{that one}} fine carack had outstripped its consorts and came {{sweeping}} along, all red and gold, with a fringe of twinkling steel, <b>a</b> good <b>half-mile</b> before the fleet.
