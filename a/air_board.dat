5|$|When a {{temporary}} <b>Air</b> <b>Board</b> {{was set up}} to examine the feasibility of an Australian Air Force (AAF), Goble was assigned as a Navy representative, with Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams, an Australian Flying Corps veteran of World War I, acting as an Army spokesman. The permanent Australian <b>Air</b> <b>Board</b> was established on 9 November 1920, and recommended creation of the AAF as an independent branch of the armed services. The AAF came into being on 31 March 1921—the 'Royal' prefix being granted five months later—and Goble resigned his commission in the RAF the same day to transfer to the new service as a wing commander.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Pacific War in August 1945, SWPA was {{dissolved}} and the <b>Air</b> <b>Board</b> again assumed {{full control}} of all its operational formations. Nos.1 and 2(Training) Groups, and No.5 (Maintenance) Group, were disbanded between January and March 1946. Northern Command, having been re-designated Northern Area in December 1945, was disbanded in February 1947. The other area commands continued to function with essentially the same boundaries as during the war, except that North-Western Area no longer covered the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
5|$|Air Vice Marshal Ellis Charles Wackett, CB, CBE (13August 1901– 3August 1984) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Its chief engineer from 1935 to 1959, he served on the RAAF's controlling body, the <b>Air</b> <b>Board,</b> for a record seventeen years, and has been credited with infusing operations with new standards of airworthiness. Commencing his service career as a Royal Australian Navy cadet during World WarI, Wackett transferred to the Air Force in 1923 while on an engineering course in Britain. He qualified as a pilot before completing his studies and returning to Australia, where he inaugurated parachute instruction within the RAAF and made the country's first freefall descent from a military aircraft in 1926. The following year, he led a three-month survey flight to Papua New Guinea.|$|E

5|$|Air Vice-Marshal William Hopton (Bill) Anderson, CBE, DFC (30 December 1891– 30 December 1975) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He flew with the Australian Flying Corps in World WarI, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Belgian Croix de guerre, and leading Nos.3 and 7 Squadrons. Anderson commanded the Australian Air Corps during its brief existence in 1920, before joining the fledgling RAAF the following year. The service's third most senior officer, he primarily held posts on the Australian <b>Air</b> <b>Board</b> in the inter-war years. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1934, and promoted to air commodore in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Central Area was disbanded in August 1941 and its {{responsibilities}} divided between Southern Area, Northern Area, {{and the newly}} formed No.2 (Training) Group. The outbreak of the Pacific War resulted in Northern Area being split in January 1942 into North-Western and North-Eastern Areas, to counter separate Japanese threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea. Southern Area was also considered appropriate for division owing to its size, so the Australian <b>Air</b> <b>Board</b> proposed assigning responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to a new area command, Eastern Area, which would also assume control of units in southern Queensland from North-Eastern Area.|$|E
5|$|In December 1921, the Australian <b>Air</b> <b>Board</b> {{prepared}} to form its first five squadrons and allocate aircraft to each, {{as well as}} to the nascent flying school. The plan was for No.1 FTS to receive twelve Avro 504Ks and four Sopwith Pups, and the squadrons a total of eight Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, eight Airco DH.9s, and three Fairey IIIs. Funding problems forced the Air Force to disband the newly raised squadrons on 1July 1922 and re-form them as flights in a composite squadron under No.1 FTS. The same month, Flight Lieutenant Frank McNamara, VC, took command of the school.|$|E

5|$|In December 1966, Rowland became {{commanding}} officer of No.3 Aircraft Depot (No.3 AD) at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, with the acting rank of group captain; his promotion was made substantive in November 1967. After completing his tenure at No.3 AD in January 1969, Rowland was appointed Senior Engineering Staff Officer at Headquarters Operational Command in Glenbrook, New South Wales. In 1971 he was posted to Britain to attend the Royal College of Defence Studies, London. Returning to Australia, he was Director-General of Aircraft Engineering before being promoted to air vice marshal to serve as Air Member for Technical Services (AMTS), the RAAF's senior engineering position, in November 1972. The AMTS occupied {{a seat on the}} Australian <b>Air</b> <b>Board,</b> the service's controlling body that was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS).|$|E
5|$|Lukis {{went on to}} lead No.1 Squadron in {{the early}} 1930s, and was {{promoted}} to group captain in 1938. Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire the same year, {{he was in charge}} of RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, during the early years of World WarII. He later held forward commands in the South West Pacific theatre, including Northern Area (later North-Eastern Area), for which he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and No.9 Operational Group (later Northern Command). Lukis also served on the <b>Air</b> <b>Board,</b> the RAAF's controlling body, as Air Member for Personnel. After retirement from the Air Force in 1946, he became a manager with Australian National Airways, and was active in veterans' associations. He died in 1966 at the age of sixty-nine.|$|E
5|$|Repairs to the RAAF's F-111Cs were {{undertaken}} {{from late}} 1971, and all 24 were accepted on 15March 1973. The RAAF considered retaining the Phantoms after the F-111s entered service, and the US Government offered {{to sell the}} 23 remaining aircraft to Australia for $54 million. Studies found that the upfront cost of keeping the F-4Es would be $77 million, {{and that one of}} the MirageIII squadrons would need to be disbanded to man the Phantom-equipped units. Nevertheless, the <b>Air</b> <b>Board</b> recommended that the aircraft be retained, but a proposal to do so was rejected by the Cabinet in 1972 on advice from the Treasury. If the Phantoms had remained in service they would have been used to provide close air support for the Army.|$|E

Rivière du Loup to Winnipeg was flown by Leckie and Major Basil Hobbs in a Felixstowe F.3 and the remainder of the relay was completed using several of the CAF's DH-9As. All aircraft were part of the Imperial Gift. Although not considered suitable for the harsh Canadian weather, the Imperial Gift aircraft soldiered on into the 1930s; the last aircraft in service, an Avro 504K, was retired in 1934.|$|E
5|$|After {{repatriation}} and demobilisation, Rowland gained his engineering {{degree and}} rejoined the RAAF. He became a test pilot, serving with and later commanding the Aircraft Research and Development Unit in the 1950s, {{and also a}} senior engineering officer, being closely involved in preparations for delivery to Australia of the Dassault Mirage III supersonic fighter in the 1960s. In 1972 {{he was promoted to}} air vice marshal and became Air Member for Technical Services, holding this post until his elevation to air marshal and appointment as CAS in March 1975. He was the first engineering officer to lead the RAAF, and the first man to personally command it in a legal sense, following abolition of the Australian <b>Air</b> <b>Board</b> in 1976. Knighted in 1977, Rowland retired from the Air Force in 1979 and became Governor of New South Wales in January 1981. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1987. Retiring from the Governorship in 1989, he held a place on several boards as well as the Chancellorship of the University of Sydney.|$|E
5|$|No. 1 Squadron {{returned}} to Australia on 5March 1919, and was disbanded. In 1921, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) was {{established as a}} separate branch of the military, and on 1January 1922, the squadron was re-formed on paper. Its planned strength, approved by the <b>Air</b> <b>Board</b> in December 1921, was three officers and five airmen, operating four Airco DH.9s. Funding problems for the fledgling Air Force resulted in the disbandment on 1July of No.1 Squadron and other units established at the same time, their aircraft and personnel instead forming a single squadron of six flights {{under the control of}} No.1 Flying Training School (No.1 FTS) at Point Cook. No.1 Squadron was reactivated as an operational unit of the RAAF reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF), at Point Cook on 1July 1925. Its commanding officer was Flight Lieutenant Harry Cobby.|$|E

5|$|On {{the eve of}} World WarII, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{comprised}} twelve flying squadrons, two aircraft depots and {{a flying}} school, situated at five air bases: Point Cook and Laverton in Victoria; Richmond and Rathmines in New South Wales; and Pearce in Western Australia. An air force of this size did not require large-scale operational formations such as wings, groups, or commands, as all units could be directly administered and controlled by RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne. With the onset of war in September 1939, the Australian <b>Air</b> <b>Board</b> decided to implement a decentralised form of command and control, commensurate with an envisioned increase in manpower and units. The RAAF's initial move in this direction was to create Nos.1 and 2 Groups in November 1939, the former based in Melbourne to control units in Victoria, and the latter in Sydney to control units in New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.38 Group RAF, Bladin {{was closely}} {{involved}} in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of France. He flew a mission on D-Day, 6June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to Normandy, and was mentioned in despatches two days later. Completing his RAF {{service on the}} staff of the Second Tactical Air Force in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944. On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with directives from the <b>Air</b> <b>Board,</b> the RAAF's controlling body, but in the end the Australian government made no change to command arrangements.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Air</b> <b>Board</b> {{subsequently}} rationalised EATS {{facilities in}} southern New South Wales, dividing {{the staff and}} aircraft of No.2 SFTS between Nos.5 and 7 Service Flying Training Schools at nearby RAAF Stations Uranquinty and Deniliquin, respectively. Eaton remained {{in command of the}} school until shortly before its disbandment on 3April 1942. No.2 SFTS had suffered a total of four serious accidents in Ansons and eleven in Wirraways, resulting in the deaths of three instructors and four students. Out of some 600 entrants, just over 550 pilots graduated from the school, among them Clive Caldwell, later to become Australia's leading fighter ace of the war, and future Prime Minister John Gorton. No.60 Squadron was also disbanded on 3April, after a brief career during which its activities had been limited to training exercises. The base facilities were taken over by No.5 Aircraft Depot, responsible for maintenance of RAAF airframes, engines and other equipment.|$|E

5|$|The RAAF's {{area command}} {{structure}} was revised in 1942, following {{the outbreak of}} the Pacific War: Northern Area was split into North-Eastern Area and North-Western Area, and a new command covering New South Wales and southern Queensland, Eastern Area, was created, making a total of five commands. In October 1943, the <b>Air</b> <b>Board</b> proposed carving a new Central Area Command out of Eastern Area, which by then was considered too large to be controlled by one headquarters and therefore ripe for subdivision. This Central Area Command would have been responsible for training and operational units in southern Queensland. The War Cabinet deferred its decision on the proposal. The concept was raised again in August 1944, and this time the new Central Area Command was to control maintenance units, as well as training and operations, in southern Queensland. Once again, nothing came of the proposal.|$|E
5|$|To help {{overcome}} the static {{nature of the}} area command system, in September 1942 the RAAF created a large mobile formation known as No.9 (Operational) Group, a self-contained tactical air force that could keep pace with Allied advances north through New Guinea and towards Japan. By April 1944, No.9 Group had become a garrison force in New Guinea and lost its mobile function to No.10 (Operational) Group (later the Australian First Tactical Air Force). No.9 Group was therefore re-formed as a dedicated area command covering air units in New Guinea; Bostock had recommended calling it Northern Area, before RAAF Headquarters settled on Northern Command. In August that year, RAAF Headquarters proposed disbanding the training and maintenance groups formed in 1941–42 and return their functions to {{the control of the}} area commands, but no action was taken. The same month, the <b>Air</b> <b>Board</b> recommended carving a new Central Area Command out of Eastern Area, which it considered too large to be controlled by one headquarters. This proposed Central Area would have been responsible for units in southern Queensland but the War Cabinet deferred its decision, as it had when a similar concept was raised in October 1943.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Australia, Raw was {{appointed}} Director of Operational Requirements at the Department of Air. In 1969 he headed an evaluation team tasked with selecting a heavy lift helicopter for the RAAF. The team {{was faced with a}} choice between the Boeing CH-47 Chinook and Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion, and Raw's final report recommended acquiring CH-53s. The RAAF's governing <b>Air</b> <b>Board</b> and senior Army officers rejected this recommendation, and CH-47s were purchased instead after Air Vice Marshal Charles Read also reviewed the performance of the two helicopters and concluded that the Chinook better met Australia's needs. Raw remained the Director of Operational Requirements until 1970 when he became the commandant of the RAAF Staff College. In 1972 he was promoted to air commodore and assumed command of RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaysia. Raw held this position until 1976 when he returned to Australia and became the senior training and staff officer in the headquarters of RAAF Support Command. This was his final military posting; he retired from the Air Force on 28 February 1978.|$|E
