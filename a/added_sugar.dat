40|$|Consumption of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> in Canada {{is often}} {{reported}} {{to be higher than}} data suggest. Both popular and scientific articles often incorrectly report unadjusted national food supply (availability) data as actual consumption data. Additionally, when describing Canadian eating habits, US data is often cited. This does not provide an accurate reflection of Canadian consumption patterns, as Canadian intakes of many foods and beverages containing <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> are substantially below US levels (1). Misinformation about <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> consumption may be linked to complications associated with their estimation. Such difficulties include estimating waste adjustment factors to determine apparent consumption from food availability data; missing availability data for some sources of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> (notably corn sweeteners); and the lack of a comprehensive database of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> content in foods. In this article, the available literature and various reports are used to provide the best estimates of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> consumption in Canada. Estimates of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake from both Statistics Canada availability data and Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) nutrition survey data are explored in detail.

40|$|BackgroundReducing <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake {{is one of}} the Healthy People 2020 objectives. High <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake may be {{associated}} with adverse health consequences. ObjectiveThis cross-sectional study identified sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics associated with <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake among US adults (18 years and older) using the 2010 National Health Interview Survey data (n= 24, 967). MethodsThe outcome variable was <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake from foods and beverages using scoring algorithms to convert dietary screener frequency responses on nine items to estimates of individual dietary intake of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> in teaspoons per day. Added sugars intake was categorized into tertiles (lowest, middle, highest) stratified by sex. The explanatory variables were sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios for the highest and middle tertile <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake groups as compared with the lowest tertile group. ResultsEstimated median <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake was 17. 6 tsp/d for men and 11. 7 tsp/d for women. For men and women, those who had significantly greater odds for being in the highest tertile of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake (men: 22 ̆ 030522. 0 tsp/d; women: 22 ̆ 030514. 6 tsp/d) were younger, less educated, had lower income, were less physically active, were current smokers, and were former or current infrequent/light drinkers, whereas non-Hispanic other/multiracial and those living in the West had significantly lower odds for being in the highest tertile of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake. Different patterns were found by sex. Non-Hispanic black men had lower odds for being in the highest tertile of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake, whereas non-Hispanic black women had greater odds for being in the highest tertile. ConclusionsOne in three men consumed 22 ̆ 030522. 0 tsp <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> and one in three women consumed 22 ̆ 030514. 6 tsp <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> daily. Higher <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake was associated with various sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics; this information can inform efforts to design programs and policies specific to high-intake populations.

Increased consumption of <b>added</b> <b>sugars,</b> which are sweeteners added to processed and prepared foods, has been linked to a decrease in intake of essential micronutrients (1, 2) and an increase in body weight (3).

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{consumption}} of ultra-processed foods and analyse its association with the content of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> in the Chilean diet. Design: Cross-sectional study of national dietary data obtained through 24 h recalls and classified into food groups according to the extent and purpose of food processing (NOVA classification). Setting: Chile. Subjects: A probabilistic sample of 4920 individuals (aged 2 years or above) studied in 2010 by a national dietary survey (Encuesta Nacional de Consumo Alimentario). Results: Ultra-processed foods represented 28 · 6 (SE 0 · 5) % of total energy intake and 58 · 6 (SE 0 · 9) % of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake. The mean percentage of energy from <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> increased from 7 · 7 (SE 0 · 3) to 19 · 7 (SE 0 · 5) % across quintiles of the dietary share of ultra-processed foods. After adjusting for several potential sociodemographic confounders, a 5 percentage point increase in the dietary share of ultra-processed foods determined a 1 percentage point increase in the dietary content of <b>added</b> <b>sugars.</b> Individuals in the highest quintile were {{three times more likely}} (OR= 2 · 9; 95 % CI 2 · 4, 3 · 4) to exceed the 10 % upper limit for <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> recommended by the WHO compared with those in the lowest quintile, after adjusting for sociodemographic variables.

Conclusions: In Chile, ultra-processed foods are important contributors to total energy intake and to {{the consumption of}} <b>added</b> <b>sugars.</b> Actions aimed at limiting consumption of ultra-processed foods are being implemented as effective ways to achieve WHO dietary recommendations to limit <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> and processed foods, especially for children and adolescents...|$|R

[...] Concerns about the environmental impacts of agribusiness and the stark contrast between the obesity problems of the Western world and the poverty and food insecurity of the developing world have generated a strong movement towards healthy, sustainable eating as a major component of overall ethical consumerism. The environmental effects of different dietary patterns depend on many factors, including the proportion of animal and plant foods consumed and the method of food production.

The healthy rice-based Japanese diet is also high in carbohydrates and low in fat.

40|$|National {{food supply}} data and dietary surveys are {{essential}} to estimate nutrient intakes and monitor trends, yet there are few published studies estimating <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> consumption. The purpose of this report was to estimate and trend <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intakes and their contribution to total energy intake among Canadians by, first, using Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) nutrition survey data of intakes of sugars in foods and beverages, and second, using Statistics Canada availability data and adjusting these for wastage to estimate intakes. Added sugars intakes were estimated from CCHS data by categorizing the sugars content of food groups as either added or naturally occurring. Added sugars accounted for approximately half of total sugars consumed. Annual availability data were obtained from Statistics Canada CANSIM database. Estimates for <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> were obtained by summing the availability of “sugars and syrups” with availability of “soft drinks” (proxy for high fructose corn syrup) and adjusting for waste. Analysis of both survey and availability data suggests that <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> average 11 %– 13 % of total energy intake.

2500|$|Throughout {{most of the}} 19th century Champagne {{was made}} sweet. The taste was {{pleasing}} to most wine drinkers and the <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> helped winemakers to cover up flaws in the wine or poor quality from less desirable grapes. Champagne houses would use the dosage to tailor the sweetness to whatever style was in fashion in a particular market. The Russians preferred the sweetest level with as much as 250–330grams of sugar added. Scandinavia was next at around 200grams followed by France at 165grams, Germany with slightly more, and the United States preferring between 110–165grams. The English preferred the driest style at 22–66grams of sugar. Gradually tastes developed to favor less sweetness and higher overall quality in the Champagne. The first slightly dry Champagne to emerged was labeled demi-sec or [...] "half dry". The success of those wines prompted the introduction of sec or dry wines. [...] Other producers made wines with even less sugar and began to call these wines extra dry.
