5|$|North of Wemple, the {{sporadic}} residences {{along the}} highway are replaced by a string of tank farms serving barges on the Hudson River. The industrial surroundings follow NY144 into the hamlet of Glenmont, centered on the route's junction with Glenmont Road. Here, NY144 crosses over <b>another</b> <b>set</b> of railroad tracks before heading northeastward from the community toward Normans Kill. The route runs alongside the Hudson River tributary and <b>another</b> <b>set</b> of tank farms to an intersection with NY32 (Corning Hill Road) near the Port of Albany–Rensselaer, where the NY144 designation terminates. NY32 continues northward {{from this point on}} NY144's right-of-way, becoming South Pearl Street and immediately crossing Normans Kill to enter the city of Albany.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>set</b> of negotiations, {{that of the}} {{surrender}} of German armed forces, were conducted in May 1945. Smith and Strong met with {{the representatives of the}} Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, Generaloberst Alfred Jodl and Generaladmiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg. Once again, Strong acted as translator. Strong was present when, on 7 May, Smith signed {{the surrender}} document, along with Suslaparov and the French representative, Major General François Sevez.|$|E

50|$|In 1968, A.N.Kolmogorov {{proposed}} <b>another</b> <b>setting</b> {{of statistical}} problems and <b>another</b> <b>setting</b> for the asymptotics, {{in which the}} dimension of variables p increases along with the sample size n so that the ratio p/n tends to a constant. It was called the “increasing dimension asymptotics” or “the Kolmogorov asymptotics” Kolmogorov's approach {{makes it possible to}} isolate many principal terms of error probabilities and of standard measures of the quality of estimators (quality functions) for large p and n.|$|R
5|$|A three-disc Deluxe Extended Edition was {{released}} on November 14, 2006 in the U.S., and on November 3 in Australia. Twelve minutes were reinserted into the film, and a further forty minutes presented alongside {{the rest of the}} special features. The film was spread onto the first two discs with commentary by Peter Jackson and Philippa Boyens, and some featurettes on discs one and two, whilst the main special features are on disc three. <b>Another</b> <b>set</b> {{was released}}, including a WETA figurine of a bullet-ridden Kong scaling the Empire State Building, roaring at the army with Ann in hand. The extended film amounts to 200 total minutes.|$|E
5|$|Dataflow {{programming}} languages describe {{systems of}} operations on data streams, and {{the connections between}} the outputs of some operations and the inputs of others. These languages can be convenient for describing repetitive data processing tasks, in which the same acyclically-connected collection of operations is applied to many data items. They can be executed as a parallel algorithm in which each operation is performed by a parallel process as soon as <b>another</b> <b>set</b> of inputs becomes available to it.|$|E
5|$|Flies {{are capable}} of great {{manoeuvrability}} during flight due {{to the presence of}} the halteres. These act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly. The wings and halteres move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing the fly to turn sideways. The wings of the fly are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and <b>another</b> <b>set</b> used for fine control.|$|E

5|$|Formerly, only {{sections}} of the Liber had appeared in print, without translations. Parts of the Liber were edited by D. J. Stewart and published by the Anglia Christiana Society in 1848. Other extracts were published in various works, including parts of Book I that were included in Volume 2 of Jean Mabillon's nine-volume Acta Sanctorum, printed between 1688 and 1701. <b>Another</b> <b>set</b> of extracts, mainly consisting of parts of Book II, was compiled by Roger Gale's father Thomas Gale, {{as part of his}} Historicae Britannicae Scriptores XV, published at Oxford in 1691.|$|E
5|$|Gourcuff {{began the}} 2009–10 season {{claiming}} his fourth silverware with Bordeaux on 25 July 2009, winning the 2009 Trophée des Champions title in a 2–0 victory over Guingamp. As {{a result of}} his performance, he was named Man of the Match. Two weeks later, he scored a double in the club's opening match of the league season against Lens. The final result was 4–1. The victory set a record in league play for most consecutive wins for the club with 12. On 23 August, he scored <b>another</b> <b>set</b> of goals, this time against Nice in a 4–0 victory.|$|E
5|$|Like John of Tynemouth, {{a number}} of the glosses on a late-twelfth-century copy of Gratian's Decretum are {{ascribed}} to Simon. These take the form of notes from his lectures that were later added to the margins of copies of the Decretum. This combined work is now at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge University, catalogued as manuscript (MS) 283/676. <b>Another</b> <b>set</b> of student notes from his lectures, this time entitled Quaestiones, survives as part of British Library MS Royal E.VII. This work includes lecture notes not only from Simon's classes, but from John and Nicholas' as well.|$|E

5|$|Seeking {{national}} reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics, the Concordat of 1801 was signed on 15 July 1801 between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII. It solidified the Roman Catholic Church {{as the majority}} church of France and brought back most of its civil status. The hostility of devout Catholics against the state had now largely been resolved. It did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized during the revolution and sold off. As {{a part of the}} Concordat, he presented <b>another</b> <b>set</b> of laws called the Organic Articles.|$|E
5|$|Smith had {{to conduct}} <b>another</b> <b>set</b> of {{surrender}} negotiations, {{that of the}} German armed forces, in May 1945. Smith met with {{the representatives of the}} German High Command (the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht), Colonel General Alfred Jodl and General-Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg. Once again, Strong acted as an interpreter. Smith took a hard line, threatening that unless terms were accepted, the Allies would seal the front, thus forcing the remaining Germans {{into the hands of the}} Red Army, but he made some concessions regarding a ceasefire before the surrender came into effect. On May 7, Smith signed the surrender document, along with the French representative, Major General François Sevez, and the Soviet Susloparov.|$|E
5|$|The 15-inch turrets {{had been}} {{designed}} when the customary practice was to place the magazine above the shell room, {{and it was not}} cost-effective to modify the ammunition hoists to accommodate the opposite arrangement which was adopted after the Battle of Jutland demonstrated the dangers of exposing the magazines to long-range gunfire. The ship was provided with a powder-handling room above the shell room to mimic the arrangement that turret's hoists were designed to handle, and <b>another</b> <b>set</b> of hoists moved the propellant charges from the magazines to the powder-handling room. The charges were stowed in cases to reduce their exposure to fire.|$|E
5000|$|The opera {{was first}} {{performed}} on 26 December 1729 at the Teatro San Giovanni Gristostomo in Venice. Metastasio's libretto {{had been used}} in Rome, on 6 February that same year, for <b>another</b> <b>setting</b> of the same title by Leonardo Vinci.|$|R

5|$|The album package {{consists}} of 156 Polaroid photos that unfold into a 2×2 square. The Polaroid photos are seemingly random. One {{of the photos}} featured on the front cover is the eyeball of Dennis Rodman, former Chicago Bulls player and friend of the band, while another photo is of Vedder's foot {{after he had been}} stung by a stingray. The pictures, when viewed from afar, blend to form the No Code triangle/eyeball logo that is the theme throughout the album. The CD and vinyl came with lyrics printed on the back of replica Polaroids. Only nine Polaroids came in a set, leaving one to have to obtain <b>another</b> <b>set</b> to accumulate all thirteen songs.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} Smith's wives, Emma Hale, {{gave birth to}} nine {{children}} during their marriage, five of whom died {{before the age of}} two. The eldest, Alvin (born in 1828), died within hours of birth, as did twins Thaddeus and Louisa (born in 1831). When the twins died, the Smiths adopted <b>another</b> <b>set</b> of twins, Julia and Joseph, whose mother had recently died in childbirth; Joseph died of measles in 1832. In 1841, Don Carlos, who had been born a year earlier, died of malaria. In 1842, Emma gave birth to a stillborn son. Joseph and Emma had four sons who lived to maturity: Joseph Smith III, Frederick Granger Williams Smith, Alexander Hale Smith, and David Hyrum Smith.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} 1919 {{version of}} M-13 {{ran along the}} west side of the state, roughly replaced by what is now US131 in 1926. The current highway was first designated by 1932 with the M-13 moniker. After a series of extensions in the 1930s, the highway ran from Lennon to Saginaw. <b>Another</b> <b>set</b> of expansions in the 1960s added roadways that previously carried US23 all the way north to the Standish area. A related section of highway is numbered Connector M-13, a connector route that was once part of US23 in the Kawkawlin area.|$|E
