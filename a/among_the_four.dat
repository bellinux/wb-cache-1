However, green was not counted <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> classic colors of Greek painting – red, yellow, black and white – and is rarely found in Greek art.|$|E

5|$|Central Atlas Tamazight is <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> most-spoken Berber {{languages}} (the {{other three}} being Kabyle, Shilha, and Riff), and rivals Shilha as the most-spoken Berber language in Morocco. Central Atlas Tamazight is mostly spoken {{in the entire}} Middle Atlas and its outcroppings, reaching east to Taza and west to the region near Rabat. It is also spoken in the central and eastern High Atlas mountains in Morocco. It is thus spoken across areas with widely varying ecological conditions — from the mountainous and forested regions of the Middle Atlas mountains to the oases of the northwestern Sahara (Tafilalt). Berber in Morocco is spread into three areas: Riff in the north, Central Atlas in the center, and Shilha in the south/southwest. Central Atlas is not mutually intelligible with the Riff language but is with the Shilha dialect; Shilha- and Riff-speakers also cannot understand each other, That said, the Riffian language is of course related to both Shilha and Atlas Tamazight, and even though Riffian {{and the other two}} are not mutually intelligible, they share a high degree of the same vocabulary and grammar.|$|E

5|$|Jane Dudley {{served as}} a lady-in-waiting to Anne Boleyn, and later to Anne of Cleves. She was {{interested}} in the Reformed religion and, with her husband, moved in evangelical circles from the mid-1530s. In 1542 John Dudley was created Viscount Lisle. He was on friendly terms with William Parr, whose sister Catherine became Henry VIII's last queen in July 1543. As one of her closest friends, the Viscountess Lisle was <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> ladies leading her to the altar on the marriage day. Jane Dudley belonged also to the courtly sympathizers of Anne Askew, whom she contacted during her imprisonment in 1545–1546. The forthright Protestant was burnt at the stake as a heretic in July 1546 on the contrivance of the religiously conservative court party around Bishop Stephen Gardiner.|$|E

The decision put a bit of doubt to his potential return to the Vuelta a España, notwithstanding the team needing a wildcard for that race as well, in spite of his three-year string of winning the mountains classification at that race. Taaramäe, Dumoulin, El Fares, and Vogondy were also named to the squad.|$|E
5|$|The Amaury Sport Organisation {{announced}} the wildcard entries to the Tour de France in January, {{much earlier than}} in past years. Team Europcar had among their number French national champion Voeckler, though he lost that title shortly before the Tour, a de facto national hero after he wore the yellow jersey for ten days in the 2004 Tour de France. Confident of their inclusion, they were indeed <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> teams added to the 18 UCI ProTeams obligated to attend. Voeckler was named as the squad leader, with Charteau and Kern his top support riders. Gène was also named to the squad, the first black rider in the Tour's history. The team started quietly, with no rider finishing {{near the front of}} the race on stage 1 at the Mont des Alouettes and 13th of 22 teams in the stage 2 team time trial. The team did not really figure into the sprint finishes that happened early in the Tour, having left their best sprinter Chavanel off the squad for the Tour. Turgot's eighth place in stage 7 was their highest such finish.|$|E
