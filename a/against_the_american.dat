5|$|At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Sinclair {{broke the}} record of most goals scored in the Olympics for women's soccer, {{claiming}} the golden boot of the competition from two goals against South Africa, one against Great Britain, and three against the United States. She scored a hat-trick in a 4–3 extra time loss in the semifinal match <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> squad. Canada was unhappy {{with the performance of}} referee Christina Pedersen, who made a series of controversial decisions in favour of the Americans. Sinclair was ultimately fined a reported $3,500 and banned four matches for post match comments, which accused Pedersen of bias and deciding the result of the match before it had kicked off.|$|E
5|$|During this time, the Flames {{found it}} {{increasingly}} difficult to retain their best players as salaries escalated while the Canadian dollar lost value <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> dollar. Calgary has always been one of the smallest markets in the league (it is currently third-smallest, behind only Edmonton and Winnipeg) and the NHL's small-market Canadian teams found {{it increasingly difficult}} to compete in the new environment. In 1999, for example, the Flames traded Fleury to the Colorado Avalanche midway through the season. The trade came shortly after Fleury became the franchise's all-time leading scorer. Fleury was due to become an unrestricted free agent {{at the end of the}} season, and the Flames did not want to risk losing him without getting anything in return.|$|E
5|$|Early on in {{the gold}} rush, the US Army sent a small {{detachment}} to Circle City, in case intervention was required in the Klondike, while the Canadian government considered excluding all American prospectors from the Yukon Territory. Neither eventuality took place and instead the US agreed to make Dyea a sub-port of entry for Canadians, allowing British ships to land Canadian passengers and goods freely there, while Canada agreed to permit American miners {{to operate in the}} Klondike. Both decisions were unpopular among their domestic publics: American businessmen complained that their right to a monopoly on regional trade was being undermined, while the Canadian public demanded action <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> miners.|$|E

5|$|Halsey {{chose to}} follow Nimitz's request. His fleet {{completed}} fuelling on 19 January, and proceeded north towards the Balintang Channel; Task Group 30.8 {{separated from the}} main body, however, and subsequently passed through the Surigao Strait. During 20 January the fleet sailed east through the Balintang Channel, with a division of destroyers patrolling well ahead of the carrier task groups. A large number of Japanese aircraft were detected by radar during this period, and 15 which were evacuating Imperial Japanese Army Air Force personnel from Luzon were shot down. No attack was made <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> force. The Third Fleet exited the Balintang Channel at 10 pm that night.|$|E
5|$|Hiryū began {{recovering}} her Midway strike {{force at}} around 09:00 and finished shortly by 09:10.

The preparations were interrupted at 09:18, {{when the first}} attacking American carrier aircraft were sighted. These consisted of 15 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers of VT-8, led by Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron from the Hornet. They attempted a torpedo attack on Soryū, {{but all of the}} American planes were shot down by the 18 CAP fighters, leaving one surviving aviator treading water.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{planners}} {{intended for}} three divisions to attack Taejon from three directions, supported by tanks. The North Korean 3rd Division {{was ordered to}} attack from the north, against the flank. The North Korean 4th Division would attack across the Kum River from the east and south, in order to envelop Taejon and the US 24th Infantry Division with it. Eventually they would also be supported by elements of the North Korean 105th Armored Division. Although the North Korean 2nd Infantry Division was ordered to attack from Chongju <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> right flank, it was slow to move and arrived too late {{to participate in the}} battle.|$|E

5|$|The 1987 World Series {{matched the}} Cardinals <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> League {{champion}} Minnesota Twins.

Smith finished second in MVP balloting to Andre Dawson, who had played on the last-place Chicago Cubs, largely because Smith and teammate Jack Clark split the first-place vote. Following the 1987 season, Smith was awarded the largest contract in the National League at $2,340,000.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Black Christians have {{identified}} themselves spiritually with the Children of Israel. In the late 19th century, {{some of them}} also began to claim {{that they were the}} biological descendants of the Israelites. This identification with the Israelites was a response to the sociopolitical realities of their situation in the United States, including slavery and racial discrimination. For African-Americans, appropriating Jewish history was part of a rebellion <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> racial hierarchy that deemed Africans inferior. It was also a means of fulfilling their desire to know their origins and regain their lost history.|$|E
5|$|Walter Ohmsen (7 June 1911 – 19 February 1988) was {{a highly}} {{decorated}} Oberleutnant zur See in the Kriegsmarine during World War II. On 6 June 1944 the Western Allies launched Operation Overlord, the amphibious invasion of Normandy, France. Ohmsen was the first German defender of Fortress Europe to sight the invasion force. His battery engaged in heavy fighting and subsequently Ohmsen was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) {{for the defense of}} the Crisbecq Battery <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> 4th Infantry Division, which landed on Utah Beach. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recognised extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.|$|E
5|$|American {{casualties}} were climbing, both from frequent German counterattacks {{and the cost}} of storming pillboxes. The Germans had spent the night of 10 October turning cellars of houses in the town of Bardenberg into fortified pillboxes; American attackers were forced to withdraw and instead shell the town into submission. On 12 October, the Germans launched a major counterattack <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> 30th Infantry Division. It was disrupted by heavy artillery fire and well-placed anti-tank defenses. At the village of Birk, a three-hour fight broke out between German tanks and a single American Sherman; the Sherman managed to knock out an enemy Panzer IV and force another one to withdraw, but was soon attacked by others. This lone tank was eventually joined by elements of the 2nd Armored Division, and the Germans were driven from the town. The 30th Infantry Division soon found itself in defensive positions all along its front; nevertheless, it was ordered to continue pushing south for its intended link-up with the 1st Infantry Division. To accomplish this, two infantry battalions from the 29th Infantry Division were attached to the hard-pressed 30th.|$|E
