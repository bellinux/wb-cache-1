500|$|Boulton {{was tried}} by a {{tribunal}} headed by Ambroise-Dydime Lépine {{and sentenced to}} death for his interference with the provisional government. He was pardoned, but Scott interpreted this as weakness by the Métis, whom he regarded with open contempt. After Scott repeatedly quarreled with his guards, they insisted that he be tried for insubordination. At his court martial he was found guilty and was sentenced to death. Riel was repeatedly entreated to commute the sentence, but Riel responded, [...] "I have done three good things since I have commenced: I have spared Boulton's life at your instance, I pardoned Gaddy, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> shall shoot Scott." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to her onscreen debut, Francis {{appeared}} on the CBS talk show The Talk and stated that she [...] "would not have this job without Oprah Winfrey", saying: [...] "I must thank Oprah Winfrey here <b>and</b> <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> would not have this job without her. She made my dream come true as well." [...] In August 2011, Francis began experiencing lack of screen-time, leading viewers to speculate she had been let go from the soap opera and possibly returning to her General Hospital role. However, a spokesperson for The Young and the Restless confirmed that Francis was simply taking a brief hiatus to film a sequel to her Hallmark Channel film The Note.|$|E

500|$|After his {{military}} retirement, from 1971–74, Hartmann {{worked as a}} flight instructor in Hangelar, near Bonn, and also flew in an aerobatics team with Adolf Galland. In 1980 he caught a cold that developed into angina pectoris — the condition that had killed his father {{at the age of}} 58. He recovered and, by 1983, was medically cleared to fly, after which he resumed instructing at the various flying schools. However, fearing a second attack, he became cautious and limited his appearances at public events. [...] He stated: [...] "I am retired and I am a civilian, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> like to have my rest and peace. [...] I do not live for exhibitions."

500|$|One further oddity in his {{writings}} is that {{in one of his}} works, the Commentary on the Seven Catholic Epistles, he writes in a manner that gives the impression he was married. The section in question is the only one in that work that is written in first-person view. Bede says: [...] "Prayers are hindered by the conjugal duty because as often as I perform what is due to my wife I am not able to pray." [...] Another passage, in the Commentary on Luke, also mentions a wife in the first person: [...] "Formerly I possessed a wife in the lustful passion of desire <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> possess her in honourable sanctification and true love of Christ." [...] The historian Benedicta Ward argues that these passages are Bede employing a rhetorical device.|$|E
500|$|The makeup for the {{character}} of The Great Mutato was designed and created by special effects supervisor Tony Lindala. The Mutato mask went through several design iterations on paper, including 10–15 drawings and a color rendition. Constructed from latex, and containing an articulated second mouth, it cost $40,000 and took between five and seven hours to apply. In addition to the mask, Chris Owens wore contact lenses and dentures. Owens later recalled that [...] "the makeup had taken seven hours, and then I had sat around for three or four. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> was going {{to sit in the}} dark, and I could only see out of one eye. They put a big contact lens in." [...] Initial versions of the costume were deemed [...] "too human looking" [...] and so a newer design was chosen.|$|E

500|$|... "Love the Way You Lie" [...] and [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" [...] {{were based}} on a demo written and {{recorded}} in late 2009 by Grey. Grey told PopEater [...] "I wrote the demo initially for myself because I thought, ‘Oh, I have this big song, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> {{have a little bit of}} a launching pad to put out my own stuff." [...] Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on Loud, saying [...] "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision if I was going to let them have it or not. But I did and so it was on Rihanna’s album, too." [...] The demo track by Grey is on her extended play The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey, which was released on January 17, 2012.|$|E
500|$|At times Kiedis {{has also}} resented singing the song, {{especially}} during instances {{when he felt}} distanced from the song's lyrics. In the past few years, however, Kiedis has experienced a revival in interest: [...] "Although {{there have been times}} when I was over , I've rediscovered it <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> feel close to it and it still has power, and life, and purpose as a song." [...] Frusciante believed that the flexibility of [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] has contributed to its success: [...] "A lot of the time that is one of the ingredients of a hit; you can hear it over and over and it will still always mean new things, but you do go through cycles." [...] Flea believes that the reason [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] had a recent revival in relevancy was due to Frusciante's return to the band from 1998 to 2009 after quitting in 1992. Flea believed that it was vital to have the four members who wrote the track together.|$|E
500|$|On September 11, 1841 {{after the}} second bank veto, members of the cabinet entered Tyler's office {{one by one and}} resigned—an {{orchestration}} by Clay to force Tyler's resignation and place his own lieutenant, Senate President pro tempore Samuel L. Southard, in the White House. The only exception was Webster, who remained to finalize what became the 1842 Webster–Ashburton Treaty, and to demonstrate his independence from Clay. When told by Webster {{that he was willing to}} stay, Tyler is reported to have said, [...] "Give me your hand on that, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> will say to you that Henry Clay is a doomed man." [...] On September 13, when the president did not resign or give in, the Whigs in Congress expelled Tyler from the party. Tyler was lambasted by Whig newspapers and received hundreds of letters threatening his assassination. Whigs in Congress were so angry with Tyler that they refused to allocate funds to fix the White House, which had fallen into disrepair.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] finds Madonna taking {{accountability}} of her life, {{fame and}} adulation, while assessing her career and journey. It is {{a summary of}} the singer's personal experience of fame, exemplifying the thoughts in lines like [...] "I got exactly what I asked for [...] Running, rushing back for more [...] <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> find, I've changed my mind". Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna noted the track ended with the line [...] "This is my religion", indicating the spiritual thoughts and themes present in Ray of Light. According to Lucy O'Brien, author of , the lyrics touched upon Madonna's own desire for fame and how it ultimately ruined her personal relationships, thereby [...] " [...] the tone for the album". Madonna explained in an interview with Q in 1998 that the lyrics showed her ambivalence towards fame and love.

500|$|Shortly before 16:00, Hipper's force {{encountered}} the six ships of Vice Admiral Beatty's 1st and 2nd battlecruiser squadrons. The German ships {{were the first}} to open fire, at a range of approximately 15,000 yards (14,000m). When the British ships began returning fire, confusion amongst the British battlecruisers resulted in Moltke being engaged by both New Zealand and Tiger. The British rangefinders had misread the range to their German targets, and so the first salvos fired by the British ships fell a mile past the German battlecruisers. Due to errors in British communication, Derfflinger was unengaged during the first 10 minutes of the battle. Derfflingers gunnery officer, Korvettenkapitän Georg von Hase later remarked [...] "By some mistake we were being left out. I laughed grimly <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> began to engage our enemy with complete calm, as at gun practice, and with continually increasing accuracy." [...] At 17:03, the British battlecruiser [...] exploded after 15 minutes of gunfire from Von der Tann. Shortly thereafter the second half of Beatty's force, the four s of the 5th Battle Squadron, came into range and began firing at Von der Tann and Moltke.|$|E

In its opening weekend, the film grossed $2.5million ($ in [...] dollars), becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of that week. The next week it had a 60% decline in sales. The film grossed a total of $7.3million ($ in [...] dollars) worldwide, and was a box office bomb. It was placed at 97 on the top 100 movies of 1987 list. Morton noted that although [...] "Madonna's comic talent was acknowledged, cinemagoers in the United States stayed away in droves." [...] The film was better accepted in the foreign released territories, prompting Madonna to defend herself, rather weakly, that her ideas were better accepted in Europe and Japan, rather than her home country. She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged it with my tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. I also think there are people who don't want me to do well in both fields. I had to really fight to get any respect from the music business <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> guess {{there are some people who}} feel that I ought to be grateful for that respect and stick to music."

500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill."

I would try and keep a steady course with it, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that just came out of her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E
