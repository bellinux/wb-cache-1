40|$|Abstract. A {{broadcast}} {{encryption system}} allows a center to communi-cate securely over a broadcast channel with selected sets of users. Each time {{the set of}} privileged users changes, the center enacts a protocol {{to establish a new}} broadcast key that only the privileged users can obtain, and subsequent transmissions by the center are encrypted using the new broadcast key. We study the inherent trade-off between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> keys held by each user and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> transmissions needed to establish a new broadcast key. For every given upper bound on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> keys held by each user, we prove a lower bound on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> transmissions needed to establish a new broad-cast key.

40|$|Government {{policies}} that impose {{restrictions on the}} size <b>of</b> large <b>establishments</b> or firms, or promote small ones, are widespread across countries. In this paper, we develop a framework to systematically study policies of this class. We study a simple growth model with an endogenous size distribution of production units. We parameterize this model {{to account for the}} size distribution <b>of</b> <b>establishments</b> and for the (observed) large share of employment in large establishments. Then, we ask: quantitatively, how costly are {{policies that}} distort the size of production units? What is the impact of these policies on productivity measures, the equilibrium <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishments</b> and their size distribution? We find that these effects are potentially large: policies that reduce the average size <b>of</b> <b>establishments</b> by 20 % lead to reductions in output and output per establishment up to 8. 1 % and 25. 6 % respectively, as well as large increases in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishments</b> (23. 5 %) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Modern Schumpeterian growth theory {{focuses on}} the product line as the main locus of {{innovation}} and exploits endogenous product proliferation to sterilize the scale effect. The empirical core of this theory consists of two claims: (i) growth depends on average employment (i. e., employment per product line); (ii) average employment is scale invariant. We show that data on employment, R&D personnel, and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishments</b> in the US for the period 1964 – 2001 provide strong support for these claims. While employment and the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> R&D work-ers increase with no apparent matching change in the long-run trend of productivity growth, employment and R&D employment per establishment exhibit no long-run trend. We also document that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishments,</b> employment and pop-ulation exhibit a positive trend, while the ratio employment/establishment does not. Finally, we provide results of time series tests consistent with the predictions of these models...|$|R
