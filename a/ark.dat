5|$|The Torah <b>ark</b> had the {{capacity}} to house 50 Torah scrolls and was built on two levels. It was flanked by four Corinthian columns surrounded by baroque woodcuts depicting flowers and birds. The <b>Ark,</b> together with its ornamental gates, were taken from the Nikolayevsky Synagogue in Kherson, Russia, which had been used by Russian Jewish conscripts forced to spend twenty-five years in the Imperial Russian Army. Directly above the <b>Ark</b> was a triangular window with rounded points. To the right and in front of the <b>ark</b> was the cantor's podium, which was designed as a miniature version of the two-level <b>Ark.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the wave}} {{breaches}} the Himalayas and approaches the site, an impact driver lodges in the ark-door gears, keeping a boarding gate open and preventing the ship's engines from starting. In the ensuing chaos where many people attempt {{to board the}} ships, Yuri, Tamara and Gordon are killed, Tenzin is injured, <b>Ark</b> 4 begins filling with water and is set adrift after Air Force One crashes into one of its supports, while also causing it to skim the hull of <b>Ark</b> 6 before drifting off. With Jackson and Noah's help, {{the crew of the}} <b>Ark</b> manages to regain control of the <b>Ark</b> narrowly before it fatally smashes into Mount Everest.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rose deduces {{that she}} and Mickey were kept alive because their touch can {{activate}} the Genesis <b>Ark.</b> Dalek Sec explains that they cannot open the <b>Ark</b> because it is stolen Time Lord technology. He demands that Rose open it, but she refuses and mocks the Daleks until the Doctor arrives. The Doctor realises that these Daleks are the enigmatic Cult of Skaro, and uses his sonic screwdriver to allow the Cybermen into the sphere chamber. As the Cybermen attack the Daleks, Mickey accidentally activates the <b>Ark</b> while escaping. The Daleks battle the Cybermen and Dalek Sec takes the <b>Ark</b> outside. The Doctor and his companions flee into the tower. Along the way, Pete saves Jackie from the Cybermen and the two embrace. The Doctor then takes everyone to the control room where they witness the Genesis <b>Ark</b> open and millions of Daleks that were imprisoned during the Time War pour out and begin engaging the Cybermen firing on them from below, though humanity is {{caught in the crossfire}} and many are killed while running for cover.|$|E
50|$|In {{the year}} 2090, a new energy source is invented and a city is {{constructed}} {{to focus on}} the further development of this energy called Oliver Port. In response, a company called LugnalCorp utilizes this energy source for the development of conscious mecha known as ARKS (Artificial Reflexive Keneticoid). Due to the high industrial demand for the <b>ARKs,</b> LugnalCorp rushes the <b>ARKs</b> into production; after a while of operation, the <b>ARKs</b> rebel against their human operators and start their rebellion over Oliver Port. A team of fighter pilots is assembled to combat the renegade <b>ARKs</b> under the name of Murakumo.|$|R

5|$|Mendicant Bias {{is first}} {{encountered}} in Halo 3 on the <b>Ark,</b> as it attempted {{to communicate with}} the Master Chief through Terminals, claiming it sought atonement for its defection to the Flood by helping the Spartan, and was presumably destroyed along with the <b>Ark</b> when the Chief activated the incomplete Halo that the <b>Ark</b> was constructing.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 21 March 1941 a Fairey Fulmar from <b>Ark</b> Royal {{stumbled}} across Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at sea. Because of a radio malfunction, the crew {{had to return to}} <b>Ark</b> Royal to report, by which time the German ships had escaped under fog. The next day, <b>Ark</b> Royal re-established air patrols in the hope of re-locating the raiders. During the day, a catapult malfunction destroyed a Fairey Swordfish; flinging the fuselage into the sea ahead of the carrier. Unable to stop, <b>Ark</b> Royal ran over the Swordfish and was overhead when the aircraft's depth charges detonated. Scharnhorst and Gneisenau reached Brest without British harassment, while <b>Ark</b> Royal returned to Gibraltar for repairs, arriving on 24 March.|$|E
5|$|The next day, a Nazi U-boat appears and {{intercepts}} the ship. Belloq and Dietrich {{seize the}} <b>Ark</b> and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels {{with them to}} {{an island in the}} Aegean Sea. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of the <b>Ark</b> before presenting it to Hitler. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the <b>Ark</b> with a panzerfaust, but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders rather than destroy such an important historical artifact. The Nazis take Indy and Marion to an area where the <b>Ark</b> will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Belloq performs a ceremonial opening of the <b>Ark,</b> which appears to contain nothing but sand, all that remains of the Ten Commandments. Suddenly, angelic ghost-like beings emerge from the <b>Ark.</b> Indy cautions Marion to keep her eyes closed and not to observe what happens next. Belloq and the others look on in astonishment as the apparitions are suddenly revealed to be angels of death. A vortex of flame forms above the <b>Ark</b> and shoots bolts of fiery energy into the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all. As Belloq, Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror, the <b>Ark</b> turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up, Toht's face is melted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes. Flames then engulf the remains of the doomed assembly, save for Indy and Marion, and the pillar of fire rises into the sky. The Ark's lid is blasted high into the air before dropping back down onto the <b>Ark</b> and sealing it. Jones and Marion find their ropes burned off and embrace.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternate}} ending {{appears in}} the film's DVD version. After Captain Michaels (the <b>Ark</b> 4 captain) announces that they are heading for the Cape of Good Hope, Adrian receives a phone call. He answers the call, and is shocked to recognize the voice as his father's (Harry). Harry tells Adrian that he, his friend Tony (whose left arm is in a sling) and several others survived the megatsunami and are shipwrecked on an island. Adrian informs Captain Michaels of this and the <b>Ark</b> heads for them. Kate thanks Laura {{for taking care of}} Lilly, and Laura tells Jackson that she enjoyed his book. Jackson returns Noah's cell phone, which he recovered during the <b>Ark</b> 4 flood. Lilly says that she sees an island, and the <b>ark</b> finds the shipwrecked cruise ship Genesis and her survivors on a beach.|$|E

5|$|Eggman sneaks {{away with}} the last Emerald and arms the Eclipse Cannon. When he tries to fire it, the colony begins falling and a {{prerecorded}} message from Gerald broadcasts: he programmed the <b>ARK</b> to collide with Earth if the Emeralds were used, destroying it in revenge for the government condemning his research and killing his colleagues, including his granddaughter Maria. Everyone works to access the cannon's core and neutralize the <b>ARK</b> using the Master Emerald.|$|E
5|$|Evan loads {{hundreds}} of animals onto the <b>Ark</b> {{in front of}} {{hundreds of}} spectators and live news crews, who continue to mock him. Later, Long and the policemen arrive with a wrecking ball crew to try and destroy the <b>ark,</b> since it violates numerous building codes in Prestige Crest. When the wrecking crew threatens to demolish the <b>ark</b> within three minutes, a brief rainstorm occurs, prompting some of the spectators to leave. The rain also prevents the crew from proceeding, buying Evan a little time. Evan connects Long's profiteering ethics and what God had already {{told him about the}} original form of Prestige Crest, and realizes that the dam under Long Lake had violated building codes and will likely prepare to burst. Evan warns to those present must immediately board the <b>ark,</b> and many have do so when the prophesied flood is triggered soon after the dam bursts. Prestige Crest is catastrophically destroyed, and the <b>ark</b> later rides the flood through the streets and landmarks of Washington, D.C.. The <b>ark</b> reaches its final destination in front of the Capitol, which disrupts the vote on the Public Land Act bill. Long becomes outraged that the flood did really happen. Evan informs Long that the flood was actually caused by his poor design of the dam, which prompts the other Congressmen also present to turn against Long.|$|E

5|$|Evan soon {{learns that}} 614 {{actually}} {{refers to the}} verse in the Book of Genesis, where God instructs Noah to build an <b>Ark</b> {{in preparation for a}} flood. God later repeatedly appears in various guises before finally revealing himself to Evan, and cordially insisting that he should also build an <b>ark</b> as well. God explains to Evan that a flood is coming, and that the only opportunity Evan will have to change the world is by saving his community instead. God also tells Evan to inform others about the flood should they ask him later. Concerned about Evan's behavior, Joan initially believes that he is having a mid-life crisis. Evan begins constructing the <b>ark</b> with his sons, who start to admire him as he is spending more time with them.|$|E
