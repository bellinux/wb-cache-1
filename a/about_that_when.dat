2500|$|Spin {{wrote that}} Miller's {{influence}} as a songwriter outreached his fame. Miller was credited as an influential {{force in the}} 1980s- and 1990s-era music scenes, beginning in Northern California with bands associated with the Paisley Underground genre, and later influencing better-known independent pop artists. In 1996, Aimee Mann stated that [...] "Scott Miller is the best songwriter out there, in my opinion. I often think <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I'm writing: 'Would Scott think this song is any good?'" [...] adding [...] "Scott's definitely better than me." [...] Mann confirmed {{more than a decade}} later, [...] "I was very influenced by Scott Miller's songwriting," [...] and [...] "musically, he was a really big influence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{thinking}} behind his {{change of name}} when he converted to Islam he stated that he was [...] "latching on to something {{that was part of}} my heritage, because many of the slaves who were brought here were Muslims. My family was brought to America by a French planter named Alcindor, who came here from Trinidad in the 18th century. My people were Yoruba, and their culture survived slavery... My father found out <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I was a kid, and it gave me all I needed to know that, hey, I was somebody, even if nobody else knew about it. When I was a kid, no one would believe anything positive that you could say about black people. And that's a terrible burden on black people, because they don't have an accurate idea of their history, which has been either suppressed or distorted." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the taped {{conversation}} continued, {{the jury}} heard Saldívar's {{reaction to the}} news of Selena's death after her phone picked up a local radio station's signal. In an angry voice, Saldívar asked Young why he had kept the singer's condition from her, since she wanted to visit Selena at the hospital, believing she was still alive. Young told Saldívar not to believe the radio announcement, {{and that he did}} not know about Selena's current condition. The conversation then switched to Saldívar blaming Quintanilla, Jr. for the murder claiming that he threatened to kill her. She explained to Young that she bought the gun for protection after finding her car tires deliberately slashed. She also told him how Quintanilla, Jr. sexually abused her by [...] "sticking a knife" [...] in her vagina, threatening to murder her if she went to the police. When asked about what happened in her motel room, Saldívar exclaimed: [...] "I bought this gun to kill myself, not her, and she told me, 'Yolanda, I don't want you to kill yourself.' And we were talking <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I took it out and pointed it to my head, and when I pointed it to my head, she opened the door. I said 'Selena, close that door,' and when I did that gun went off." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{interpreter}} of the Lewis and Clark Expedition mistakenly identified this people as the Nez Perce {{when the team}} encountered the tribe in 1805. [...] Writing in 1889, anthropologist Alice Fletcher, who the U.S. government had sent to Idaho to allot the Nez Perce Reservation, explained the mistaken naming. [...] She wrote, [...] "It is never easy to come at {{the name of an}} Indian or even of an Indian tribe. A tribe has always at least two names; one they call themselves by and one by which they are known to other tribes. All the tribes living west of the Rocky Mountains were called [...] "Chupnit-pa-lu," [...] which means people of the pierced noses; it also means emerging from the bushes or forest; the people from the woods. [...] The tribes on the Columbia river used to pierce the nose and wear in it some ornament as you have seen some old fashioned white ladies wear in their ears. Lewis and Clark had with them an interpreter whose wife was a Shoshone or Snake woman and so it came <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> it was asked [...] "What Indians are these?" [...] the answer was [...] "They are 'Chupnit-pa-lu'" [...] and it was written down in the journal; spelled rather queerly, for white people's ears do not always catch Indian tones and of course the Indians could not spell any word." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2008, Martin (who {{had been}} {{performing}} {{under the name}} Martin Storrow) opted {{to take on the}} stage name Jakob Martin. He explained the name change to the San Diego Reader, saying, [...] "As an artist, there's a precarious balance between your private personal life and the very personal things you make public through your art. There was one moment when I realized I was actually considering changing a lyric because I didn't want to offend the person I wrote it <b>about.</b> <b>That's</b> <b>when</b> I realized I needed some separation; it can't be about me. It has to be about the music..." ...|$|R

50|$|The term started {{being used}} in the 1970s to {{describe}} related kanji neriage.

50|$|After {{establishing}} the context, {{the next step}} in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks.
