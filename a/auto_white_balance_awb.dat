40|$|Abstract. The <b>white</b> <b>balance</b> is an {{important}} parameter of digital camera which makes {{a great impact on}} the application of digital cameras. However, due to the limitations of hardware of digital camera, the output image of digital camera cannot restore true colors of the objects under the different light sources conditions. And existing automatic <b>white</b> <b>balance</b> (<b>AWB)</b> algorithms have many application restrictions, particularly the single color image, the algorithms always failure to adjust. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an optimized algorithm based on the gray world assumption and HSI color model. According to the R, G and B color components probability distribution, the algorithm adjusts the image by using the difference value of color. Experimental results show that our algorithm can adjust images in complex situations; meanwhile these confirm that this method is not only effective, but also has the advantage of easy realization. 1...|$|R

White-Point Color Temperature Curve (WPCTC) is constructed from sensor calibration and is utilized to estimate white-point locations in a scene. Minimum Color Temperature Distance (MCTD) with a luminance threshold is defined to further locate white-points of an image exactly. Our proposed method is performed in RGB color space so it is suitable for digital still camera pipeline design.

30|$|In {{order to}} render images {{captured}} {{with a single}} chip image sensor as a viewable image, an image processing pipeline is required. The most important parts of this image processing pipeline are demosaicing and the automatic <b>white</b> <b>balance</b> (<b>AWB).</b> Since only one color component is available at each pixel, the other two missing color components have to be estimated from the neighboring pixels. This process {{is referred to as}} CFA demosaicing or CFA interpolation. The color constancy property of the human visual system allows the perceived color to remain relatively constant at different color temperatures [2]. This capability is required for cameras to generate natural-looking images that match with human perception. The goal of the AWB method is to emulate human color constancy. This is normally achieved by adjusting the image so that it looks as if it were taken under a canonical light (usually daylight).|$|R

However, {{there is no need to}} estimate α because the <b>auto</b> <b>white</b> <b>balance</b> sub-module of IPM adjusts the slopes of the RGB channels to be equal [14]. Therefore, f(·) can be approximated as f(x)=x+β. β represents the black level of an image sensor which can be simply estimated as the average of the optical black region located on the boundary of the image sensor [21].|$|R
40|$|Variation in {{illumination}} {{conditions will}} create situations where hue {{of the dominant}} illuminant is different. It {{can be said that}} the illumination sources have different color temperatures. The human visual system has developed to adapt to these changes of the illumination hue, and thus it is able to maintain the color constancy of the objects. The task of the Automatic <b>White</b> <b>Balance</b> (<b>AWB)</b> is to do the same in digital cameras. The purpose of the AWB is to get the output colors to look as much same as the human eye saw the scene when the image was taken, i. e., as natural. The main objective of this thesis is to implement a mobile application which can collect data from the accuracy of the AWB algorithm and record the level of the color adaption of eye in different illumination conditions. With this application test users can capture images and adjust the colors immediately after the capturing. In this case, the adjustments are done in the same illumination condition as the capturing. This is important because the human visual system will adapt to see white as white in different illuminations.

40|$|Single image dehazing {{has been}} a {{challenging}} problem due to its ill-posed nature. While most of the existing single image based dehazing algorithms address this issue by introducing certain assumptions and priors into the haze imaging model, the imaging process of imaging devices has been seldom taken into account, such as <b>white</b> <b>balance</b> and metering. In general, consumer photos are taken with <b>AWB</b> (<b>Auto</b> <b>White</b> <b>Balance).</b> Hence, color temperature in a foggy scenario may not be correctly detected, which results in color distortion; and the whole scene looks brighter, which leads to under-exposure during the imaging process. In this paper, we propose to handle these two issues by applying <b>white</b> <b>balance</b> correction and decomposing an image into two component images, reflex lightness image and ambience illumination image. We devise an improved dark channel prior based algorithm to dehaze the reflex lightness image and the exposure adjustment is estimated from the ambience illumination image. Finally, a high quality haze- free image is produced by refining {{the brightness of the}} preliminarily dehazed image with the estimated exposure adjustment. Experimental results with a benchmark dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, in terms of contrast and color fidelity.

40|$|Color {{constancy}} is {{the ability}} to perceive colors of objects, invariant to the color of the light source. The aim for color constancy algorithms is first to estimate the illuminant of the light source, and then correct the image so that the corrected image appears to be taken under a canonical light source. The task of the automatic <b>white</b> <b>balance</b> (<b>AWB)</b> is to do the same in digital cameras so that the images taken by a digital camera look as natural as possible. The main challenge rises due to the illposed nature of the problem, that is both the spectral distribution of the illuminant and the scene reflectance are unknown. Most common methods used for addressing the AWB problem are based on low-level statistics assuming that illuminant information can be extracted from the image’s spatial information. Nevertheless, in recent studies the problem has been approached with machine learning techniques quite often and they have been proved to be very useful. In this thesis, we investigate learning color constancy using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Two different artificial neural network approaches are utilized to generate a new AWB algorithm by weighting some of the existing AWB algorithms. The first approach proves to be better than the existing approaches in terms of median error. On the other hand, the second method, which is better also from system design point of view, is superior to others including the first approach in terms of mean and median error. Furthermore, we also analyze camera sensor invariance by quantifying how much the performance of the ANNs degrade when the test sensor is different than the training sensor...|$|R

40|$|Current FPGAs can {{implement}} large systems {{because of}} the high density of reconfigurable logic resources in a single chip. FPGAs are comprehensive devices that combine flexibility and high performance in the same platform compared to other platform such as General-Purpose Processors (GPPs) and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The flexibility of modern FPGAs is further enhanced by introducing Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) feature, which allows for changing the functionality of part of the system while other parts are functioning. FPGAs became an important platform for digital image processing applications {{because of the}} aforementioned features. They can fulfil the need of efficient and flexible platforms that execute imaging tasks efficiently as well as the reliably with low power, high performance and high flexibility. The use of FPGAs as accelerators for image processing outperforms most of the current solutions. Current FPGA solutions can to load part of the imaging application that needs high computational power on dedicated reconfigurable hardware accelerators while other parts are working on the traditional solution to increase the system performance. Moreover, the use of the DPR feature enhances the flexibility of image processing further by swapping accelerators in and out at run-time. The use of fault mitigation techniques in FPGAs enables imaging applications to operate in harsh environments following the fact that FPGAs are sensitive to radiation and extreme conditions. The aim of this thesis is to present a platform for efficient implementations of imaging tasks. The research uses FPGAs as the key component of this platform and uses the concept of DPR to increase the performance, flexibility, to reduce the power dissipation and to expand the cycle of possible imaging applications. In this context, it proposes the use of FPGAs to accelerate the Image Processing Pipeline (IPP) stages, the core part of most imaging devices. The thesis has a number of novel concepts. The first novel concept is the use of FPGA hardware environment and DPR feature to increase the parallelism and achieve high flexibility. The concept also increases the performance and reduces the power consumption and area utilisation. Based on this concept, the following implementations are presented in this thesis: An implementation of Adams Hamilton Demosaicing algorithm for camera colour interpolation, which exploits the FPGA parallelism to outperform other equivalents. In addition, an implementation of Automatic <b>White</b> <b>Balance</b> (<b>AWB),</b> another IPP stage that employs DPR feature to prove the mentioned novelty aspects. Another novel concept in this thesis is presented in chapter 6, which uses DPR feature to develop a novel flexible imaging system that requires less logic and can be implemented in small FPGAs. The system can be employed as a template for any imaging application with no limitation. Moreover, discussed in this thesis is a novel reliable version of the imaging system that adopts novel techniques including scrubbing, Built-In Self Test (BIST), and Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) to detect and correct errors using the Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP) primitive. These techniques exploit the datapath-based nature of the implemented imaging system to improve the system's overall reliability. The thesis presents a proposal for integrating the imaging system with the Robust Reliable Reconfigurable Real-Time Heterogeneous Operating System (R 4 THOS) to get the best out of the system. The proposal shows the suitability of the proposed DPR imaging system to be used as part of the core system of autonomous cars because of its unbounded flexibility.
