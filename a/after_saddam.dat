25|$|Nearly {{from its}} {{founding}} {{as a modern}} state in 1920, Iraq has {{had to deal with}} Kurdish separatists {{in the northern part of}} the country. Saddam did negotiate an agreement in 1970 with separatist Kurdish leaders, giving them autonomy, but the agreement broke down. The result was brutal fighting between the government and Kurdish groups and even Iraqi bombing of Kurdish villages in Iran, which caused Iraqi relations with Iran to deteriorate. However, <b>after</b> <b>Saddam</b> had negotiated the 1975 treaty with Iran, the Shah withdrew support for the Kurds, who suffered a total defeat.|$|E
25|$|Iraqi {{authorities}} put Saddam {{and seven}} other former Iraqi officials on trial on 19 October 2005, {{four days after}} the 15 October 2005 referendum on the new Iraq constitution. The tribunal specifically charged the defendants with the killing of 148 Shiites from Dujail, in retaliation for the failed assassination attempt of 8 July 1982. Supporters of Saddam protested against the trial in Tikrit. After the charges were read to them, all eight defendants pleaded not guilty. While initially open to the public, the trial was closed to them on 15 March 2006, <b>after</b> <b>Saddam</b> began making political statements on the stand and an argument began between him and the presiding judge.|$|E

500|$|Conditions in Anbar {{particularly}} favored an insurgency. The province was overwhelmingly Sunni, {{the minority}} religious group that lost {{its power and}} influence in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. Hussein was also very popular in the province {{than anywhere else in}} the country. Many did not fight during the invasion (allowing them to claim that they had not been defeated) and [...] "still wanted to slug it out", according to journalist Tom Ricks. Military service was compulsory in Saddam's Iraq and the Amiriyah area contained a sizeable portion of Iraq's arms industry. Immediately <b>after</b> <b>Saddam</b> fell, insurgents and others looted many of the 96 known munitions sites, as well as local armories and weapons stockpiles. [...] These weapons were used to arm the insurgents in Anbar and elsewhere. While only a small minority of Sunnis were initially insurgents, many either supported or tolerated them. Sympathetic Ba'athists and former Saddam officials in Syrian exile provided money, sanctuary, and foreign fighters to insurgent groups. Future al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi spent part of 2002 in central Iraq, including Anbar Province, preparing for resistance. [...] Within several months of the invasion the province had become a sanctuary for anti-occupation fighters.|$|E

Claiming that he was unaware that some intelligence officials questioned the information prior to his presentation, Powell pushed for reform in the intelligence community, including the creation of a national intelligence director who would assure that [...] "what one person knew, everyone else knew." ...|$|E

2500|$|Saddam {{began to}} recite the Shahada twice. As he neared {{the end of his}} second recitation when he was about to say Muhammad, the {{trapdoor}} sprang.

[...] During the drop there was an audible crack indicating that his neck was broken. <b>After</b> <b>Saddam</b> was suspended for a few minutes, the doctor present listened with a stethoscope for a heartbeat. After he detected none, the rope was cut, and the body was placed in a coffin. He was confirmed dead at 06:03.|$|E
2500|$|Delegates to a National Congress {{elected the}} members of the National Command, who were {{eligible}} for reelection. While the National Command had few de facto powers, many of its leading members also held seats in the Iraqi Regional Command and the Revolutionary Command Council. Aflaq was elected Secretary-General of the National Command at the Ninth National Congress, held in February 1968 in Beirut, Lebanon, by the Iraqi-dominated [...] Ba'ath Party. He retained his post until his death in 1989, when he was succeeded by Saddam Hussein. <b>After</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein was executed on 30 December 2006, Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri became de facto leader of the Ba'ath Party on 3 January 2007.

The branch has maintained {{good relations with the}} Baghdad-based Ba'ath Party, even <b>after</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's downfall following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The party was able to field candidates for parliamentary seats during the 1992 parliamentary elections, and was the only party (with the exception of the Republican Party for Democracy and Renewal) to field candidates for senate elections. However, the party secured only one percent of the vote nationwide and did not secure a seat in either Parliament or the senate. Kabry Ould Taleb Jiddou, the party's leader, was awarded the office of Secretary of State by the newly elected government because of his electoral campaign.|$|E

5000|$|According {{to history}} {{professor}} Fritz Umbach, the document archive has been seeded [...] "with suggestive jihadist materials" [...] {{unrelated to the}} war in Iraq, and cites specific examples.

[...] He also notes that the archive website was linked [...] "to an entirely unrelated database of al-Qaida materials", the Harmony database, creating confusion over documents suggestive of a link between Iraq and al-Qaeda. Umbach writes, [...] "Whether intentional or not, the conflation and confusion of materials has been more than sufficient to convince bloggers on the political right that there were, as Bush officials insisted, operational links between Saddam's Iraq and al-Qaida." ...|$|R
