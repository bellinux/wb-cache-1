5000|$|Every {{point in}} the {{healthcare}} experience has a potential to result in <b>a</b> service <b>failure.</b> For example, if a health service takes longer than a patient expects, or if a service does have the outcome the patient was anticipating, <b>a</b> service <b>failure</b> has occurred. Even the setting or {{environment in which the}} care is being provided can affect <b>a</b> service <b>failure.</b> Perhaps surprisingly, patients themselves can contribute to service failures by failing to read signage or correctly completing required forms.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a replacement model with age-dependent failure type {{based on a}} cumulative repair-cost limit policy, whose concept uses the information of all repair costs {{to decide whether the}} system is repaired or replaced. <b>As</b> <b>failures</b> occur, the system experiences one of the two types of failures: <b>a</b> type-I <b>failure</b> (minor), rectified by a minimal repair; or <b>a</b> type-II <b>failure</b> (catastrophic) that calls for a replacement. <b>A</b> critical type-I <b>failure</b> means <b>a</b> minor <b>failure</b> at which the accumulated repair cost exceeds the pre-determined limit for the first time. The system is replaced at the nth type-I <b>failure,</b> or at <b>a</b> critical type-I <b>failure,</b> or at first type-II failure, whichever occurs first. The optimal number of minimal repairs before replacement which minimizes the mean cost rate is derived and studied in terms of its existence and uniqueness. Several classical models in maintenance literature are special cases of our model...|$|R

5|$|Attachment {{disorder}} {{is a broad}} term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> to form normal attachments to primary care giving figures in early childhood.

A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>failures</b> <b>a</b> process may undergo, <b>a</b> crash <b>failure</b> ora Byzantine <b>failure.</b> <b>A</b> crash <b>failure</b> occurs when <b>a</b> process {{abruptly}} stopsand does not resume. Byzantine failures are failures in which absolutely noconditions are imposed. For example, they may occur as a result of themalicious actions of an adversary. A process that experiences <b>a</b> Byzantine <b>failure</b> may send contradictory orconflicting data to other processes, or it may sleep and then resumeactivity after a lengthy delay. Of the two types of failures, Byzantinefailures are far more disruptive.Thus, a consensus protocol tolerating Byzantine failures must be resilient to every possible error thatcan occur.|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} will {{summarize the}} history and the technology of instant recovery from system and media failures. The story starts with modern hardware, e. g., flash storage, and the danger of localized failures due to limited write endurance. Initial research sought methods for detection and recovery of localized, i. e., single-page failures. Figure 1 : Single-page failures. [GK 12] Figure 1 distinguishes multiple failure classes. If single-page recovery is available, a stor-age device remains useful even after <b>a</b> localized <b>failure.</b> Otherwise, <b>a</b> single-page <b>failure</b> may imply <b>a</b> device <b>failure,</b> which in turn may imply a node failure- clearly very undesir-able if it is avoidable. Figure 2 : Instant recovery from system failures. Figure 2 illustrates an application of single-page recovery, specifically incremental re-covery from <b>a</b> system <b>failure,</b> e. g., <b>a</b> process crash. Traditional implementations permit new database transactions only after all recovery activities are complete, which may take 214 minutes or even hours. Instant recovery after <b>a</b> system <b>failure</b> requires only log analysis...|$|R
