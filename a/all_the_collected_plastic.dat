These were, on one hand, <b>the</b> data <b>collected</b> during <b>the</b> riding sessions (audio-visual {{recordings of the}} rider’s and instructor’s behaviours, and the actors’ verbal data during training, i.e. 38  h of recordings) {{and on the other}} hand, <b>the</b> verbal data <b>collected</b> after <b>the</b> riding sessions, by interviews (i.e. 47  h of recordings). The aim was to combine these two types of data in order to analyze activities in the greatest possible detail. The following information was provided in the first section: the effective time of the session, the specific behaviours of the actors (e.g. a fall), the training sessions (i.e. the type and the number of achieved exercises), and the verbal data. For the second section, the information is the effective time of the interview and the verbal data. The aim is that the verbal data can specify at each moment the observed riding session. It was made a verbatim retranscription of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>collected</b> verbal data (during and after training sessions). The corpus contains nearly 1000 pages in A 3 format.|$|R

The forests support many endemic species, such as the Iriomote Wildcat （Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis）. The population of the island was 2, 284 as of December 2009, {{while the number of}} tourists who visited in 2009 was 304, 440. Many islanders and some volunteers have been collecting marine litter on beaches of the island. <b>The</b> amount <b>collected</b> on May 25, 2008, on a beach in Funaura Bay was 6. 305 m^ 3. <b>The</b> <b>collected</b> items included polystyrene foam, plastic bottles, fishing gear, fluorescent tubes, electric bulbs, plastics, and more. The number of <b>plastic</b> bottles <b>collected</b> from Hinai Beach on April 20, 2008, was 918 : 252 of them had labels with bar codes while 666 bottles had no label. By using the numbers in the bar codes, we could identify the origin of <b>the</b> products. <b>The</b> <b>collected</b> <b>plastic</b> bottles came from various countries: 53 % from China, 22 % from Taiwan, 7 % from Japan, 8 % from South Korea, and others from Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, Egypt, the Philippines, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia. The northeast wind in winter {{may be one of the}} main causes of the flow of trash from China and South Korea to the beach. Most of the plastic bottles from southern countries such as Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Taiwan may have been brought by the Kuroshio Current to the island. Large amounts of marine litter, mostly from outside the island, still exist on beaches and coastal areas. The islanders are facing difficulties in processing collected marine litter as well as removing it because they have only limited funding and labour.
