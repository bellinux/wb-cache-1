They differ in both pharmacokinetics (<b>absorption</b> <b>factor,</b> half-life, volume of distribution, clearance) and pharmacodynamics (for example the capacity of mineralocorticoid activity: retention of sodium (Na+) and water; renal physiology). Because they permeate the intestines easily, they are administered primarily per os (by mouth), but also by other methods, such as topically on skin. More than 90% of them bind different plasma proteins, though with a different binding specificity. Endogenous glucocorticoids and some synthetic corticoids have high affinity to the protein transcortin (also called corticosteroid-binding globulin), whereas all of them bind albumin. In the liver, they quickly metabolize by conjugation with a sulfate or glucuronic acid, and are secreted in the urine.|$|E

5000|$|Solar {{insolation}} {{is made up}} of direct, diffuse, {{and reflected}} radiation. The <b>absorption</b> <b>factor</b> of a PV cell is deﬁned as the fraction of incident solar irradiance that is absorbed by the cell. At high noon on a cloudless day at the equator, the power of the sun is about 1 kW/m², on the Earth's surface, to a plane that is perpendicular to the sun's rays. As such, PV arrays can track the sun through each day to greatly enhance energy collection. However, tracking devices add cost, and require maintenance, so it is more common for PV arrays to have fixed mounts that tilt the array and face solar noon (approximately due south in the Northern Hemisphere or due north in the Southern Hemisphere). The tilt angle, from horizontal, can be varied for season, but if fixed, should be set to give optimal array output during the peak electrical demand portion of a typical year for a stand-alone system. This optimal module tilt angle is not necessarily identical to the tilt angle for maximum annual array energy output. The optimization of the photovoltaic system for a specific environment can be complicated as issues of solar flux, soiling, and snow losses should be taken into effect. In addition, recent work has shown that spectral effects can play a role in optimal photovoltaic material selection. For example, the spectral albedo can {{play a significant role in}} output depending on the surface around the photovoltaic system [...] and the type of solar cell material. For the weather and latitudes of the United States and Europe, typical insolation ranges from 4 kWh/m²/day in northern climes to 6.5 kWh/m²/day in the sunniest regions. A photovoltaic installation in the southern latitudes of Europe or the United States may expect to produce 1 kWh/m²/day. A typical 1 kW photovoltaic installation in Australia or the southern latitudes of Europe or United States, may produce 3.5-5 kWh per day, dependent on location, orientation, tilt, insolation and other factors. In the Sahara desert, with less cloud cover and a better solar angle, one could ideally obtain closer to 8.3 kWh/m²/day provided the nearly ever present wind would not blow sand onto the units. The area of the Sahara desert is over 9 million km². 90,600 km², or about 1%, could generate as much electricity as all of the world's power plants combined.|$|E

The potential minima are in the range of - 105 to - 120 °K and appear to substantiate current theoretical estimates of the effective pair potential {{in the presence of a}} weak three-body force. The data analysis procedure used was new and does not distinguish between the coherent and incoherent <b>absorption</b> <b>factors</b> for the cell scattering which were essentially equal. With this simplification, the argon scattering estimate was compared to the gas scattering estimate on the laboratory frame of reference and the two estimates coincided, indicating the data normalized. The argon scattering on the laboratory frame of reference was examined for the existence of the peaks in the structure factor and the existence of an observable third peak was considered doubtful. Numerical studies of the effect of truncation, normalization, the subsidiary peak phenomenon in the radial distribution function, uncertainties in the low angle data relative to errors in the direct correlation function and the distortion phenomenon are presented. The distortion phenomenon for this experiment explains why the Mikolaj-Pings argon data yielded pair potential well depths from the Percus-Yevick equation that were too shallow and an apparent slope with respect to density that was too steep compared to theoretical estimates.
