From such an embedding, the Nash-Kuiper process builds {{a sequence of}} maps converging toward an isometric embedding. In that paper, we describe this Nash-Kuiper process {{in the case of}} curves.

The drift velocity b {{is assumed to}} be at the critical regularity level, with respect to the natural scaling of the equations. The proof draws on Campanato's characterization <b>of</b> <b>Hölder</b> spaces, and uses a maximum-principle-type argument by which we control the growth in time of certain local averages of u. We provide an estimate that does not depend on any local smallness condition on the vector field b, but only on scale invariant quantities...|$|R

50|$|In Finland, most {{doctoral}} degrees awarded {{in the fields}} of natural sciences, technology and economics are termed D.Sc. degrees in English, with a suffix indicating the field of study. However, there is no translation of the term Doctor of Science to Finnish. For example, the proper translation for the doctorate in technology (tekniikan tohtori) would be D.Sc. (Tech.), whereas a doctorate in economics and business administration (kauppatieteiden tohtori) would be translated as D.Sc. (Econ.). When conversing or writing in English, the prefix Dr may be used to <b>address</b> a <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> a doctoral degree awarded in Finland.|$|R

5000|$|In Malta, the European Union's {{smallest}} member state, the LL.D. is a doctorate-level {{academic degree}} in law requiring {{at least three}} years of post-graduate full-time study at the University of Malta, Malta's national university. At least three years of previous law study are required for entry. Students are required to complete coursework in a number of core areas of law, as well as to submit a thesis which is to be [...] "an original work on the approved subject or other contribution to the knowledge showing that he/she has carried out sufficient research therein". It confers the title of Doctor, which in Malta is rigorously used to <b>address</b> a <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> the degree. The LL.D. is one of the requirements for admission to the profession of advocate in Malta (an advocate, as opposed to a legal procurator, has rights of representation in superior courts).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Individual {{users are}} able {{to buy and sell}} a broad variety of goods and {{services}} worldwide on online auction and shopping websites, e. g. eBay. com and Taobao. com. However, attackers have also attempted to conduct fraudulent activities against honest parties for the purpose of illegitimate profit. On Internet auction sites, auction fraud mainly involves fraud attributable to the non-delivery of products purchased through an Internet auction site or the misrepresentation of a product advertised for sale. Malicious sellers may post a non existing item for bidding with false description to deceive the buyer concerning its true value, and request payments to be wired directly to them. Similarly, malicious buyers may make a purchase through a fraudulent credit card where the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the card <b>holder</b> does not match the shipping address. Both consumers as well as merchants can be victims of online auction fraud, as well as the commercial auction websites. In this paper we study the problem of building models for the online auction fraud detection system, which essentially evolves dynamically over time. We propose a Bayesian probit online model framework for auction fraud detection...|$|R
