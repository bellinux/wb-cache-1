5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) entertains her parents, William Scully (Don Davis) and Margaret Scully (Sheila Larken), {{shortly after}} Christmas. After they leave, she falls asleep on her sofa. Several hours later, {{she wakes up}} to see her father sitting <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>her,</b> {{speaking}} silently. The telephone rings, and after looking at the phone, she finds the chair empty again. She answers the call—from her mother, who tells her that her father {{died of a heart}} attack an hour earlier.|$|E
5|$|The 1499 Madonna {{panel is}} a free adaption, in that the artist has changed and repositioned a number of elements. However, art historians usually agree that they are to the {{detriment}} of the balance and impact of the composition. The panel attributed to Gossaert shows even more significant, though perhaps more successful, alterations, including shifting the centre of balance by adding a section to the right-hand side, dressing the Virgin entirely in dark blue and changing her facial features. Both copies omit the two pools of bright light on the floor <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>her,</b> thus removing the mystical element of van Eyck's original, perhaps because its significance was not grasped by the later artists. That Gossaert followed other aspects of the original so closely, however, is evidence of the high regard he held for van Eyck's technical and aesthetic ability, and his version has been seen by some as a homage. The Master of 1499's admiration for van Eyck can be seen in his left-hand panel, which contains many features reminiscent of van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, including the rendering of the ceiling beams and the colour and texture of the red fabrics.|$|E
25|$|As {{the story}} {{continues}} {{from the previous}} episode, Emma sees the woman <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> in the cell as the same woman who was arrested for helping Snow, and learns that they are both due to be executed immediately the next day. Using her tricks from the night Neal broke into the amusement park, Emma remembers {{she knows how to}} break a lock by using two spoons, and it works. Later on, Charming catches Snow in the rope trap, although the timeline of their introduction is thrown off, until Hook shows up to say that another woman (Emma) has his ring. Charming looks at Snow's fairy dust pendant while she tells him her backstory (another timeline that was thrown off), and comes {{up with a plan to}} break into Regina’s castle first, then rescue Emma and steal back the ring. Snow tells them to wait, which gives Hook and Charming time to talk about love. Moments later, Red Riding Hood shows up, revealing herself as a friend of Snow's, and who can get them into the castle. As they reach the place, Red, who transformed into a wolf, scares a guard into running away, but the escape plan goes awry when they run into Emma and her fellow inmate, prompting Hook to tell Emma that she deprived him of a dashing rescue. Seconds later, Snow and Regina prepare to face off, with Snow throwing her dark fairy dust, but Regina uses her magic to stop it in midair. Snow tries telling her that what happened to Daniel (when she told Cora) was a mistake, saying that she was only a child, but an unforgiving Regina talks about consequences and sets up a stake to burn her. Regina throws a fireball at the helpless Snow White, who appears to die. Her death causes Red to howl as a wolf and Emma to cry over her mother's death.|$|E

2500|$|After Burns was released, she {{was quickly}} rearrested for {{continuing}} protests, picketing, and marching at the White House. Upon her third arrest in 1917, the judge aimed {{to make an}} example of Burns, and she was given the maximum sentence. [...] Once again a prisoner at Occoquan Workhouse, Lucy Burns endured what is remembered as the “Night of Terror.” The women were treated brutally and were refused medical attention. To unite the women, Burns tried to call roll and refused to stop despite numerous threats by the guards. When they realized Lucy Burns's spirit {{was not going to}} be easily broken, they handcuffed her hands above her head to her cell door and left her that way for the entire night. Burns was so loved and respected by her fellow suffragists that the women in the cell <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> held their hands above their head and stood in the same position. Despite her courage and extraordinary leadership skills, the burden of working so diligently did bother Burns at times; she once told Alice Paul, “I am so nervous I cannot eat or sleep. I am such a coward I ought to be a village seamstress, instead of a Woman’s Party organizer.” ...|$|E
60|$|A wild {{little village}} came in sight. This was the destination. Again no. Only the tall, {{handsome}} mountain youth who had sat <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>her,</b> descended grumbling because the 'bus {{had brought him}} past his road, the driver having refused to pull up. Everybody expostulated with him, and he dropped into the shadow. The big priest squeezed into his place. The 'bus wound on and on, and always towards that hollow sky-line between the high peaks.|$|E
6000|$|The {{interests}} {{of the two men}} were so strongly concerned in the matter that they watched her closely, and were not long in noticing that whenever Ned presented himself at the bar she would {{in a very short time}} come <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> place behind to speak to him, sometimes only exchanging a word or two, at others, if business happened to be at all slack, chatting with him for some minutes. That day, when as usual they sat down to dinner together, Truscott said: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1928, {{she agreed}} to donate $50,000 (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) to {{excavate}} the salt pond and create an artificial freshwater lake <b>across</b> <b>from</b> Bellosguardo (...) , <b>her</b> family's [...] estate on the Pacific Coast in Santa Barbara, California. She stipulated that the facility would be named the Andrée Clark Bird Refuge, after her sister, who had died of meningitis.|$|R
50|$|On March 21, Michael McDuffie, a {{vending machine}} serviceman, was assaulted, murdered, and robbed in his {{suburban}} {{home by the}} Brileys. Two weeks later, on April 9, the brothers followed 76-year-old Mary Gowen <b>across</b> town <b>from</b> <b>her</b> babysitting job. They followed her into her house to rape and murder <b>her.</b> They escaped <b>from</b> the residence with many of her valuables.|$|R

60|$|The {{induction}} {{services were}} interesting, and Mary Isabel enjoyed them. Doctor Hamilton was sitting <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> and {{once or twice}} she caught him looking at her admiringly. The doctor noticed the hat and the grey silk and wondered how Mary Isabel {{had managed to get}} her own way concerning them. What a pretty woman she was! Really, he had never realized before how very pretty she was. But then, he had never seen her except in a sunbonnet or with her hair combed primly back.|$|E
60|$|James {{looked at}} his daughter-in-law. That unseen glance of his was cold and dubious. Appeal and fear were in it, {{and a sense of}} {{personal}} grievance. Why should he be worried like this? It was very likely all nonsense; women were funny things! They exaggerated so, you didn't know what to believe; and then, nobody told him anything, he had to find out everything for himself. Again he looked furtively at Irene, and <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> to Soames. The latter, listening to Aunt Juley, was looking up, under his brows in the direction of Bosinney.|$|E
60|$|By this time, the Rancocus had returned, and had {{discharged}} her inward-bound cargo at the Reef, bringing excellent {{returns for}} the oils sent to Hamburgh. She now lay in Whaling Bight, being about to load anew with oil {{that had been}} taken during her absence. Saunders was as busy as a bee; and Mrs. Saunders, who had come <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> own residence on the Peak, {{in order to remain}} as long as possible with her husband, was as happy as the day was long; seeming never to tire of exhibiting her presents to the other women at the Bight.|$|E
50|$|Cling learned <b>her</b> pottery skills <b>from</b> <b>her</b> mother, master potter Rose Williams. She lived <b>across</b> {{the highway}} <b>from</b> <b>her</b> mother in Shonto, Arizona.

60|$|When Duane {{returned}} to the sitting-room Colonel Longstreth was absent, also several of the other passengers. Miss Ruth {{sat in the chair}} he had vacated, and <b>across</b> the table <b>from</b> <b>her</b> sat Miss Longstreth. Duane went directly to them.|$|R
60|$|At table, <b>across</b> {{the corner}} <b>from</b> <b>her,</b> {{he could not}} help a surreptitious {{studying}} of her. While he held his own in the general fun and foolishness, it was his hostess that mostly filled the circle of his eye and the content of his mind.|$|R
60|$|Miss Hill {{attended}} to her usual task with {{the papers of}} the day's lessons and the marking of the morrow's work before she {{glanced up at the}} five girls she had detained. They sat in widely separated sections of the room. Rose Clymer, pretty, fragile, curly-haired, occupied {{the front seat of the}} end row. Her face had no color and her small mouth was set in painful lines. Four seats <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> Bessy Bell leaned on her desk, with defiant calmness, and traces of scorn still in her expressive eyes. Gail Matthews looked frightened and Helen Tremaine was crying. Ruth Winthrop bent forward with her face buried in her arms.|$|E
60|$|Miss Cynthia did not {{get much}} comfort out of life that summer. Almost {{everywhere}} she went she was sure to meet Wilbur, engaged in some hard task. She could not help seeing how miserably pale and thin he had become. The worry had its effect on her. The neighbours said that Cynthy was sharper than ever. Even her church-going was embittered. She had always enjoyed walking up the aisle with her rich silk skirt rustling over the carpet, her cashmere shawl folded correctly over her shoulders, and her lace bonnet set precisely on her thin shining crimps. But she could take no pleasure in that or in the sermon now, when Wilbur sat right <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> pew, between hard-featured Robins and his sulky-looking wife. The boy's eyes had grown too large for his thin face.|$|E
60|$|Two blocks <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>her,</b> {{seen through}} the rising walls of the new apartment-houses, were the drab windows {{of a group of}} {{run-down}} tenements, which broke the sleek respectability of the well-to-do quarter. In those windows Ruth observed foreign-looking, idle women, not very clean, who had nothing to do after they had completed half an hour of slovenly housework in the morning. They watched their neighbors breathlessly. They peered out with the petty virulent curiosity of the workless at whatever passed in the streets below them. Fifty times a day they could be seen to lean far out on their fire-escapes and follow with slowly craning necks and unblinking eyes the passing of something--ice-wagons, undertakers' wagons, ole-clo' men, Ruth surmised. The rest of the time, ragged-haired and greasy of wrapper, gum-chewing and yawning, they rested their unlovely stomachs on discolored sofa-cushions on the window-sills and waited for something to appear. Two blocks away they were--yet to Ruth they seemed to be in the room with her, claiming her as one of their sisterhood. For now she was a useless woman, as they were. She raged with the thought that she might grow to be like them in every respect--she, Ruth Winslow!... She wondered if any of them were Norwegians named Ericson.... With the fascination of dread she watched them as closely as they watched the world with the hypnotization of unspeakable hopelessness.... She had to find her work, something for which the world needed her, lest she be left here, useless and unhappy in a flat. In her kitchen she was merely an intruder on the efficient maid, and there was no nursery.|$|E
2500|$|Sadie is {{introduced}} in July 1968 as former Lord family maid at their manor, Llanfair. She eventually {{quit her job}} there to become head of housekeeping at Llanview Hospital.

60|$|Mary Louise went to {{her room}} and was {{promptly}} pounced upon by Dorothy Knerr and Sue Finley, who roomed just <b>across</b> the hall <b>from</b> <b>her</b> and were delighted to find she was to become a regular boarder. They asked numerous questions as they helped her to unpack and settle her room, but accepted her conservative answers without comment.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1940, {{she began}} {{collecting}} Mexican handcrafts and folk art. At first {{she kept her}} acquisitions in her apartment but soon it was overflowing and she rented the apartment <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> to use as storage. Later she acquired a house in Coyoacán which was larger to accommodate her growing collection which included textiles, glass, miniatures, toys, cartonería, niños dios, nativity scenes and much more.|$|E

Hutton noticed Charles work one morning on a gate <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> loft on Bond Street. Intrigued by the art, Hutton came into Urban Works to inquire about meeting the artist. Hutton became an intricate part of the Bond Street studio until it closed in 1997 and moved to Union Square.|$|E
