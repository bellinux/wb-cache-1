40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{reports a}} {{synthesis}} methodology for linear <b>analog</b> <b>circuits.</b> A general-ized Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) network has been synthesized {{that can be}} easily pro-grammed to realize different linear <b>analog</b> <b>circuits.</b> OTA is a voltage to current (V-I) converter with differential input. This property has been exploited in this synthe-sis procedure. Efficient <b>analog</b> <b>circuits</b> synthesized with this methodology are reported along with the simulation results. ...|$|R
2500|$|According {{to fellow}} <b>analog</b> <b>circuit</b> {{designer}} Bob Pease, Widlar {{cut down on}} his drinking shortly before death. Gifford said in 2002: [...] "He stopped drinking but I think the damage was probably done, you know, in the first twenty years." [...] According to Bo Lojek, [...] "as he was older he was {{for the first time}} able to keep relationship with one woman." ...|$|E
2500|$|In <b>analog</b> <b>circuit</b> design, the current-control view is {{sometimes}} used {{because it is}} approximately linear. That is, the collector current is approximately [...] times the base current. Some basic circuits can be designed by assuming that the emitter–base voltage is approximately constant, and that collector current is beta times the base current. However, to accurately and reliably design production BJT circuits, the voltage-control (for example, Ebers–Moll) model is required. The voltage-control model requires an exponential function {{to be taken into}} account, but when it is linearized such that the transistor can be modeled as a transconductance, as in the Ebers–Moll model, design for circuits such as differential amplifiers again becomes a mostly linear problem, so the voltage-control view is often preferred. For translinear circuits, in which the exponential I–V curve is key to the operation, the transistors are usually modeled as voltage-controlled current sources whose transconductance is proportional to their collector current. In general, transistor-level circuit design is performed using SPICE or a comparable <b>analog</b> <b>circuit</b> simulator, so model complexity is usually not of much concern to the designer.|$|E
2500|$|A VU meter {{is often}} {{included}} in <b>analog</b> <b>circuit,</b> audio equipment {{to display a}} signal level in Volume Units. It is intentionally a [...] "slow" [...] measurement, averaging out peaks and troughs of short duration to reflect the perceived loudness of the material. It was originally invented in 1939 by the combined effort of Bell Labs and broadcasters CBS and NBC for measuring and standardizing the levels of telephone lines. The instrument used to measure VU is called the volume indicator (VI) instrument. Most users ignore this {{and call it a}} VU meter.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to create a}} system for optimisaton of {{specific}} <b>analog</b> <b>circuits</b> by evolution using multiple fitness functions. A set of experiments was run, and the results analyzed to evaluate the feasibility of evolutionary optimisation of <b>analog</b> <b>circuits.</b> A requirement for this goal is the study and choice of certain types of <b>analog</b> <b>circuits</b> and evolutionary algorithms. For the scope of this work, amplifiers and oscillators were chosen as target circuits, and genetic algorithms and evolutionary strategies as evolutionary algorithms. The motivation for this work is the ongoing effort to automate the design and optimisation of <b>analog</b> <b>circuits,</b> where evolutionary optimisation is one of the options...|$|R
2500|$|The first-order hold (FOH) is a {{mathematical}} model of the practical reconstruction of sampled signals {{that could be done}} by a conventional digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and an <b>analog</b> <b>circuit</b> called an integrator. [...] For the FOH, the signal is reconstructed as a piecewise linear approximation to the original signal that was sampled. [...] A mathematical model such as the FOH (or, more commonly, the zero-order hold) is necessary because, in the sampling and reconstruction theorem, a sequence of Dirac impulses, xs(t), representing the discrete samples, x(nT), is low-pass filtered to recover the original signal that was sampled, x(t). [...] However, outputting a sequence of Dirac impulses is impractical. Devices can be implemented, using a conventional DAC and some linear analog circuitry, to reconstruct the piecewise linear output for either the predictive or delayed FOH.|$|E
2500|$|Building 20 was {{the home}} of [...] the Tech Model Railroad Club, where many aspects of what later became the hacker culture developed. [...] Around 1973, the MIT Electronic Research Society (MITERS) was founded there, as an early student-run hackerspace. [...] Building 20 also housed {{one of the first}} {{anechoic}} chambers, where research was performed by acoustics pioneer Leo Beranek. [...] Professor Amar Bose did his early research on loudspeakers here, eventually leading to the founding of Bose Corporation. Prolific <b>analog</b> <b>circuit</b> designer and technical writer Jim Williams had an electronics lab here for a decade, before moving on to National Semiconductor and then Linear Technology. The Strobe Lab of high-speed photography trailblazer Harold [...] "Doc" [...] Edgerton was located here for many years, although the facility was relocated to Building 4 before the final years of Building 20.|$|E
2500|$|Avalanche {{transistor}} circuits are intrinsically {{large signal}} circuits, so small signal models, {{when applied to}} such circuits, can only give a qualitative description. To obtain more accurate information about the behavior of time dependent voltages and currents in such circuits {{it is necessary to}} use numerical analysis. The [...] "classical" [...] approach, detailed in the paper [...] which relies upon the book , consists in considering the circuits as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and solve it by a numerical method implemented by a general purpose numerical simulation software: results obtained in this way are fairly accurate and simple to obtain. However, this methods rely on the use of analytical transistor models best suited for the analysis of the breakdown region: those models are not necessarily suited to describe the device working in all possible regions. A more modern approach is to use the common <b>analog</b> <b>circuit</b> simulator SPICE together with an advanced transistor model supporting avalanche breakdown simulations, which the basic SPICE transistor model does not. Examples of such models are described in the paper [...] and in the paper : the latter is a description of the Mextram model, currently used by some semiconductor industries to characterize their bipolar junction transistors.|$|E
