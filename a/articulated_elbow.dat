50|$|The forelimbs of the Berlin {{specimen}} {{are among}} the best-preserved elements of the skeleton. Both arms are spread in dorsal view, still articulated with the shoulder socket. The <b>articulated</b> <b>elbow</b> joins upper and upper arm at a 45-degree angle; the wrist joins lower arm and manus at a 100-degree angle. While this element confused Dames originally, Petronievics eventually identified a large distal and smaller proximal carpal bone, which Danish paleontologist Gerhard Heilmann identified as a single fused bone. Today we recognize this bone as the semilunate carpal, after its half-moon shape. The hands of the Berlin specimen are beautifully preserved, and {{in contrast to the}} London specimen definitively showed the hands as three-fingered, rather than two-fingered. Though in close contact and oriented parallel to one another, the fingers are not fused as in modern birds. The first digit of the hand is the shortest, the second is the longest, and the third intermediate. The first digit appeared to be more mobile than the others. The position of the third digit, which overlapped with the second on both forelimbs, {{is likely to be a}} post-mortem displacement. The total length of the Berlin specimen forelimb is about 20 cm long, just over half the length of the entire nose-to-tail measurement of the animal.|$|E
5000|$|Little Pullip is a {{miniature}} version of Pullip, with a 1:12 scale {{body and a}} 1:6 scale head. Often called a [...] "mini," [...] these little versions stand about 4.5 inches tall. Little Pullips lack <b>articulated</b> <b>elbows</b> or knee joints, their shoes are painted on, and their eyes do not move or blink. Despite their small size and limited articulation points, they are still somewhat customizable: they can be given new wigs, bodies, eye colors, and makeup.|$|R
40|$|The {{preliminary}} {{design of a}} Shuttle-Attached Manipulator System is based on two arms that are <b>articulated</b> at shoulder, <b>elbow,</b> and wrist. Details of manipulator design are considered, giving attention to arm reach, velocity, acceleration, torque, joint angular travel limits, control, crew systems and man-machine interface, and telecommunications. The results of man-in-the-loop simulations show the feasibility of grappling a representative space payload from the Shuttle using a long boom manipulator system. The task, however, is sufficiently difficult to require the full concentration of one operator who should be relieved of any other tasks while performing operations with the manipulator system...|$|R
40|$|Elbow is a bone joint {{having a}} single axis and {{performing}} two movements: flexion and extension. Because this axis, passing through trochlea and humerus, is not perfectly transversal, but oriented from outside to inside, forward to backward and from up to low, {{during the two}} movements the forearm and the arm form an opened angle. Consequently, the complex movement guided around this axis supposes particular shapes for the <b>articulated</b> bones in <b>elbow</b> and to design and realize prosthesis in case of important damage becomes a long and difficult procedure. More, the dimensions of prosthesis depend on anthropomorphic sizes of every patient. For these reasons, in the present paper, we propose an approach much more rapid and more cheap – rapid prototyping (RP). The proposed technology is thermal injection, which {{is a part of}} RP technology. It allows executing rapidly solid 3 D models by CAD and, after that the prototype is done in short time, in accord with needed dimensions and with a very good quality. The specific device is technically simple, needs less material and more rapid. 1. ELEMENTS OF ARM’S BIOMECHANICS The human arm contains bones, joints, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. Many of these muscles ar...|$|R
