Existing analog tapped delay lines for realizing the equalization filter at a bit rate of 40 Gbit/s commonly use external manual or random dithering approaches for tap weight adjustment 1, 2.

40|$|To {{explore the}} {{hypothesis}} that load-induced fluid flow in bone is a mechano-transduction mechanism in bone <b>adaptation,</b> <b>unit</b> cell micro-mechanical techniques are used to relate the microstructure of Haversian cortical bone to its effective poroelastic properties. Computational poroelastic models are then applied to compute in vitro Haversian fluid flows in a prismatic specimen of cortical bone during harmonic bending excitations over the frequency range of 10 0 to 10 6 Hz. At each frequency considered, the steady state harmonic response of the poroelastic bone specimen is computed using complex frequencydomain finite element analysis. At the higher frequencies considered, the breakdown of Poisueille flow in Haversian canals is modeled by introduction of a complex fluid viscosity. Peak bone fluid pressures are found to increase linearly with loading frequency in proportion to peak bone stress up to frequencies of approximately 10 kHz. Haversian fluid shear stresses are found to increase linearly with excitation frequency and loading magnitude up until the breakdown of Poisueille flow. Tan � values associated with the energy dissipated by load-induced fluid flow are also compared with values measured experimentally in a concurrent broadband spectral analysis of bone. The computational models indicate that fluid shear stresses and fluid pressures in the Haversian system could, under physiologically realistic loading, easily reach {{the level of a}} few Pascals, which have been shown in other works to elicit cell responses in vitro. © 2003 American Institute o...|$|E
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 150 - 157). Next generation {{wireless network}} (NGWN) will be heterogeneous where different radio access technologies (RATs) coexist. This coexistence of different RATs necessitates joint radio resource management (JRRM) for enhanced QoS provisioning and efficient radio resource utilization. Joint call admission control (JCAC) algorithm {{is one of}} the joint radio resource management algorithms. The basic functions of a JCAC algorithm are {{to decide whether or not}} an incoming call can be accepted into a heterogeneous wireless network, and to determine which of the available RATs is most suitable to admit the incoming call. The objective of a JCAC algorithm is to guarantee the QoS requirements of all accepted calls and at the same time make the best use of the available radio resources. Traditional call admission control algorithms designed for homogeneous wireless networks do not provide a single solution to address the heterogeneous architecture, which characterizes NGWN. Consequently, there is need to develop JCAC algorithms for heterogeneous wireless networks. The thesis proposes three JCAC schemes for improving QoS and radio resource utilization, which are of primary concerns, in heterogeneous wireless networks. The first scheme combines adaptive bandwidth management and joint call admission control. The objectives of the first scheme are to enhance average system utilization, guarantee QoS requirements of all accepted calls, and reduce new call blocking probability and handoff call dropping probability in heterogeneous wireless networks. The scheme consists of three components namely: joint call admission controller, bandwidth reservation unit, and bandwidth <b>adaptation</b> <b>unit.</b> Using Markov decision process, an analytical model is developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme considering three performance metrics, which are new call blocking probability, handoff call dropping probability, and system utilization. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme improves system utilization and reduces both new call blocking probability and handoff call dropping probability. The second proposed JCAC scheme minimizes call blocking probability by determining the optimal call allocation policy among the available RATs. The scheme measures the arrival rates of different classes of calls into the heterogeneous wireless network. Using linear programming technique, the JCAC scheme determines the call allocation policy that minimizes call-blocking probability in the heterogeneous network. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme reduces call-blocking probability in the heterogeneous wireless network...|$|E
40|$|Active {{competition}} in the telecommunications industry has caused a dramatic shift in focus for public network operators. Service designers {{need to be able}} to easily and rapidly create services according to the customer’s requirements. This is achievable by using Intelligent Networks (INs). Two primary goals of service development under the Intelligent Network paradigm are rapid service crcation using new software technologies and the minimisation of service development costs through switch vendor independence. This thesis examines the development of an IN architecture and the deployment of two call control services on it using the ITU-T Service Independent Building Block (SIB) methodology. The services are deployed on a narrow-band Excel switching platform. Various aspects of the IN Conceptual Model (INCM) are examined with a particular emphasis on the middle two planes: the Global Functional Plane (GFP) and the Distributed Functional Plane (DFP). Representations of these planes are designed using the ITU-T Specification and Description Language (SDL) [SDL 89] and implemented using Telelogic’s SDL Development Tool (SDT). SDL provides capabilities to allow logical structuring of the INCM into its constituent entities, the modelling of communication between these entities and the processing within them. The Intelligent Network paradigm was developed with a view to extendibility. Two call control services, Ringback and Group Call Pickup, are implemented using the SIB methodology. Further services may be created by rearranging the order of execution of the existing SIBs or, if necessary, by adding new SIBs to the architecture. Given the demand for multimedia applications to run on top of emerging broadband networks it is becoming increasingly more important for network operators to study the enhancement and evolution of their IN service platforms in order to cope with new customer requirements. TINA is the leading architecture for multimedia service control and delivery, which defines an emerging open service platform. Migration from IN to TINA is explored in this thesis by considering two individual paths of migration. The first path involves the replacement of the IN service control and management elements (SCF, SMF, SDF) with appropriate TINA Computational Objects while the switching elements (SSF, CCF) remain IN compliant. As there is no one-to-one mapping of IN functional entities to TINA computational objects, an <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Unit</b> is required to facilitate interaction between the legacy IN entities and the TINA Computational Objects. The advantage of this step is that it is possible to keep the investment of deployed IN SSPs while taking advantage of TINA service modelling. The second step involves the introduction of TINA into the switch. In this approach the switch and its switching capabilities may be viewed as a TINA object in itself. Interworking between IN and TINA (as a step towards full migration to TINA) yields a much richer service platform. This service platform facilitates the creation of services that incorporate both IN and TINA features. A TINA service may use pieces of IN functionality and IN services may also use TINA functionality. It is possible to invoke these hybrid services from either a PSTN or a TINA terminal. Three hybrid IN/TINA services were designed to demonstrate the increased resources available to the service designer using such a platform. A user connected to the IN switch invokes the Freephone Service. This service uses a TINA database to convert the 1 - 800 number to an extension number. The call is then connected using IN switching functionality. The Audio Video Conference, uses TINA computational objects to set up a video stream between participating users while the audio connection is handled by the IN switching functionality. This service is invoked from a TINA terminal. A user connected to the IN switch invokes the Ringback Service but it runs in the TINA domain using both TINA and IN functionality. Therefore, as well as presenting an application of the IN technology, this thesis proposes possible steps towards migration to the TINA architecture...|$|E

However, despite their utility and contributions, CPRs have been neglected and declined in the recent decades, following economic, demographic and institutional changes. This has led to community's general disregard of rapidly degrading CPRs. Despite this general trend the CPRs are being productively rehabilitated by small user groups through focusing on specific CPR units in place of addressing the aggregates of CPRs. The paper reports this change by synthesizing the information collected from over 80 villages during 1982 - 85 and revisits during 1993 - 2003 to some of the earlier studied villages, in seven states falling in arid and semi-arid regions of India.

40|$|AbstractFollowing {{adaptation}} to an oriented (1 -d) signal in central vision, {{the orientation of}} subsequently viewed test signals may appear repelled away from or attracted towards the adapting orientation. Small angular differences between the adaptor and test yield ‘repulsive’ shifts, while large angular differences yield ‘attractive’ shifts. In peripheral vision, however, both small and large angular differences yield repulsive shifts. To account for these tilt after-effects (TAEs), a cascaded model of orientation estimation that is optimized using hierarchical Bayesian methods is proposed. The model accounts for orientation bias through adaptation-induced losses in information that arise because of signal uncertainties and neural constraints placed upon the propagation of visual information. Repulsive (direct) TAEs arise at early stages of visual processing from <b>adaptation</b> of orientation-selective <b>units</b> with peak sensitivity at {{the orientation of the}} adaptor (θ). Attractive (indirect) TAEs result from <b>adaptation</b> of second-stage <b>units</b> with peak sensitivity at θ and θ+ 90 °, which arise from an efficient stage of linear compression that pools across the responses of the first-stage orientation-selective units. A spatial orientation vector is estimated from the transformed oriented unit responses. The change from attractive to repulsive TAEs in peripheral vision {{can be explained by the}} differing harmonic biases resulting from constraints on signal power (in central vision) versus signal uncertainties in orientation (in peripheral vision). The proposed model is consistent with recent work by computational neuroscientists in supposing that visual bias reflects the adjustment of a rational system in the light of uncertain signals and system constraints...|$|R
