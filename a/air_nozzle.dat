50|$|A Flit gun {{consists}} of a pneumatic pump cylinder with a hand-operated piston to force air through an <b>air</b> <b>nozzle</b> in the front. Below {{the front of the}} pneumatic tube hangs a cylindrical container designed to act as a reservoir for liquid insecticide, this reservoir being set at 90 degrees to the pneumatic tube. In early versions, the reservoir is permanently secured to the pump and equipped with a removable, gasketed screw cap for filling. In later, improved versions, the insecticide reservoir is secured to the pump with a coarse screw fitting and a seal of cork composite or gasket paper, so that it can readily be unscrewed for filling. A siphon tube extends from the pump cylinder downward into the reservoir and {{the upper end of the}} siphon is positioned in front of a nozzle on the air pump. When a jet of high-velocity air exits the pump and streams across end of the siphon tube, it lowers the pressure in the siphon, drawing insecticide upward from the reservoir, which then atomizes the liquid as it is entrained in the air jet. With each vigorous forward stroke of the pump handle a burst of spray is produced, similar to that of a modern aerosol spray can.|$|E

The systematic combustion tests were conducted to investigate the thermal performance and heat transfer effect of the exploratory hot model. The different ratios of the top to the bottom secondary air flow rate were chosen to study the effect of the secondary air flow rate. The test results indicated that the secondary air flow rate was a very sensitive factor to the combustion temperature profile. The heat transfer coefficients were changed along the combustor height. Numerical simulation was continued to determine the pressure profiles and temperature profiles in the hot combustor model. The pressure change at the bottom is greater than that of the top region because of a large amount of primary air input. The higher pressure zone is formed where the secondary air flows into the center region of the combustor. The high temperature zone of the bottom section is located at the fuel injector nozzle outlet.

40|$|Abstract Extensive Computational Fluid Dynamic {{simulations}} on {{combustion process}} in a 120 MW natural gas-fired industrial boiler have been performed. The boiler is of tangential system by which natural gas and air are fired into the furnace from its four corners at three different elevation levels. Fuel burners and <b>air</b> <b>nozzles</b> can be tilted {{in the range of}} 30. The simulation results show good prediction of temperature profile and distribution as compared to practical observation. The flow in the furnace is highly swirling with intense mixing of natural gas and air. The turbulence level is extremely high and combustion gas flows in helical shape in anti-clockwise direction towards the furnace exit. The results revealed the importance of the effect of heat transfer to the water wall as the temperature distribution and flow pattern is significantly difference with heat transfer and without heat transfer cases. Temperature distribution prior to the entry to the re-heater elevation is non-uniform with lower velocity at vortex core where the fireball is located. The average temperature at re-heater level reduces when the burner is negatively tilted up to - 10. A slight change in firing angle will interrupt the temperature and flow contour at furnace-re-heater. However this is only true for <b>air</b> <b>nozzles</b> where the overall flow pattern inside the furnace is dominated by these sources. ...|$|R

40|$|During {{the current}} quarter, pilot-scale testing with the {{modified}} <b>air</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{version of the}} PC burner was completed with PRB coal at the Riley Power Inc. (RPI) test facility. A total of 8 different burner configurations were tested utilizing various burner <b>air</b> <b>nozzle</b> arrangements {{in place of the}} burner air channels. It was found that with the arrangements tested, a stable flame could not be maintained at coal feed rates above 100 lb/h. While it is felt that the <b>air</b> <b>nozzle</b> approach can ultimately be used effectively, in the interest of holding to the current project schedule it was decided to proceed with the balance of the project using the air channel design. The pilot-scale PC burner was therefore restored to the air-channel configuration and benchmark testing with PRB coal to confirmed previous operating results. A series of tests was then conducted with PRB and West Virginia caking coal to evaluate modifications to the gas combustor configuration and operation for improved performance with caking coal. Continuous operation was achieved with caking coal up to 50 lb/h vs. the full load target of 150 lb/h. Impingement and deposition of partially devolatilized coal occurred at various points within the combustor when the caking coal feed was increased above 50 lb/h. The 100 MMBtu/h commercial-scale prototype design was continued with coal burner design input from both RPI and VTI. Based on typical burner installation layout considerations, it was decided that the preheat combustor should be oriented horizontally on the axial centerline of the coal burner. Accordingly, the pilot gas combustor was changed to this orientation so that the pilot results with caking coal will be directly applicable to the preferred 100 MMBtu design. Testing with caking coal in the horizontal pilot combustor achieved feed rates up to 126 lb/h, although some deposition and LOI issues remain. Several promising approaches to further improve operation with caking coal were identified. NOx results with caking coal are promising, with NOx as low as 150 ppmv at exit oxygen levels of 4 % and higher. The 100 MMBtu/h commercial-scale prototype design is nearing completion. Design of the caking coal version of the unit continues with additional pilot testing in support of this design expected. GTI and RPI are expediting the fabrication of the 100 MMBtu/h PRB unit in order to start testing in early- to mid-December. Inspection and repair of the 100 MMBtu/h Coal Burner Test Facility (CBTF) is nearing completion. As of mid-September, this activity was 95 % complete...|$|E
