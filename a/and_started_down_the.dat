5|$|Sometime between 10:00 and 11:00 the {{advanced}} platoon of E Company, 8th Cavalry Regiment, arrived {{on top of}} Hill 755 and came into D Company's perimeter. Some of the engineers fired on the E Company men before the latter identified themselves. The E Company platoon went into position {{on the right of}} Vandygriff, and Kennedy turned over command of the combined force to the E Company commander. Kennedy then assembled 12 wounded men <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> mountain with them. The party was under small arms fire most of the way. A carrying party of Korean A-frame porters led by an American officer had started up the mountain during the morning with supplies. North Korean fire, killing several of the porters, turned it back.|$|E
25|$|Once {{across the}} Snake River ford near Old Fort Boise the weary {{travelers}} traveled across {{what would become}} the state of Oregon. The trail then went to the Malheur River and then past Farewell Bend on the Snake River, up the Burnt River canyon and northwest to the Grande Ronde Valley near present-day La Grande before coming to the Blue Mountains. In 1843 settlers cut a wagon road over these mountains making them passable {{for the first time to}} wagons. The trail went to the Whitman Mission near Fort Nez Perces in Washington until 1847 when the Whitmans were killed by Native Americans. At Fort Nez Perce some built rafts or hired boats <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Columbia; others continued west in their wagons until they reached The Dalles. After 1847 the trail bypassed the closed mission and headed almost due west to present day Pendleton, Oregon, crossing the Umatilla River, John Day River, and Deschutes River before arriving at The Dalles. Interstate 84 in Oregon roughly follows the original Oregon Trail from Idaho to The Dalles.|$|E
500|$|On 17 September 1950 {{a pair of}} Grumman F9F-2 Panthers {{launched}} from the deck of [...] Philippine Sea. VF-112 Ensign Edward D. Jackson Jr. was leading a section [...] dispatched to strafe an airfield near North Korea's capital, Pyongyang. Flying on his wing was Ensign Dayl E. Crow. The airfield {{turned out to be}} little more than a grass strip littered with burned and shattered Soviet-built war machines. After strafing a locomotive and setting it ablaze, the jets turned north <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Han River. Soon, Jackson spotted about 75 river boats. When they starting receiving small arms fire from [...] "passengers" [...] on the vessels, Crow followed Jackson down as they made a low strafing pass, splintering many of the small craft with 20mm cannon fire. After the pass both attackers started to climb from [...] AGL. Jackson then flew through an aerial booby trap: steel cables strung across the Han to [...] "clothesline" [...] low flying planes. The Panther ripped through the cables like twine, but the whipsawing cable strands caught the starboard wing, shredded the wingtip tank and snapped across the canopy, punching out the windscreen and side windows. The impact knocked Jackson unconscious with severe facial injuries. Crow, flying just astern noticed something wrong, then saw the crushed wing tank and shattered canopy, its inner surface misted with blood. After 20 seconds Jackson regained consciousness and found himself blinded by shards of Plexiglas and blood. Crow was able to guide his leader towards the Yellow Sea, but Jackson was fading in and out of consciousness. With only the left flap down due to damage to the right wing the Panther approached the ship {{and with the help of}} LSO Lt.j.g."Les" [...] Bruestle and Crow the blind pilot trapped the #4 wire on the first attempt. Jackson survived with 36 stitches and an emergency blood transfusion.|$|E
60|$|The whole river {{seemed to}} pick itself up <b>and</b> <b>start</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stream. With the {{increasing}} motion the ice-wall broke {{in a hundred}} places, and from up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> shore came the rending and crashing of uprooted trees.|$|R
60|$|Two {{days after}} the {{departure}} of Mrs. Brooke, her brother <b>and</b> Stanley <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Hoogly in a native trader.|$|R
50|$|Siegfried arrives, and the Wanderer {{questions}} the youth. Siegfried, {{who does not}} recognize his grandfather, answers insolently <b>and</b> <b>starts</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> path toward Br√ºnnhilde's rock. The Wanderer blocks his path, but Siegfried mocks him, laughing at his floppy hat and his missing eye, and breaks his spear (the symbol of Wotan's authority) with a blow from Nothung. Wotan calmly gathers up the pieces and vanishes.|$|R
60|$|Virginia rose, flicked her riding-whip, <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> steps.|$|E
60|$|He stamped off the porch, {{his huge}} spurs rattling, <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> path toward the waiting men.|$|E
60|$|It {{was after}} three {{when they left}} the tent <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> trail, {{carrying}} nothing but a few toilet articles.|$|E
5000|$|Nicklaus uses a flash grenade to escape, {{prompting}} Bishop and Sheila {{to chase}} {{him as he}} boards a plane <b>and</b> <b>starts</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> runway. The player shoots {{a hole in the}} gas tank, and uses a flare to ignite it as Nicklaus takes off. The flare burns along the gas trail, reaching the plane and destroying it, killing Nicklaus as well. The game ends with Billy wondering who [...] "the battle was really against".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think these}} are still good to use," [...] he said, <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> creek, to wash them off and inspect them more closely.|$|R
50|$|After {{a period}} of silence, Carter tells Bird to hide <b>and</b> <b>starts</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stairs. Sade in the {{meanwhile}} makes his way barefoot across the roof. He ends {{up at the top}} of the stairs, where he is surprised by Carter, and falls <b>down</b> <b>the</b> glass-strewn stairs. Fed-up, Sade plans to set the house on fire, but changes his mind and calls Carter's wife on Carter's cell phone which he had found earlier. Resting again, the men engage in another argument.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, good-night, fellows," [...] he said, <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill, with sixty exasperated and grimly {{determined}} stampeders at his heels.|$|E
60|$|So {{the cries}} ran {{on as the}} two bobsleds slowly {{gathered}} momentum <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long slope leading to Clearwater Lake.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{seeing that}} I was not wanted, I took my cudgel <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{bridle-path}} towards the common footbridge, when suddenly {{my mother called}} me back.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't, for it's {{none of my}} business," [...] said Johnny Chuck, <b>and</b> <b>started</b> on <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Crooked Little Path to the Green Meadows.|$|R
60|$|He {{took his}} bundle, <b>and</b> <b>started</b> off <b>down</b> <b>the</b> garden path {{with a grand}} air. I looked at the Vicomtesse inquiringly, and there was {{laughter}} in her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on! Come on! You've {{got here}} just in' time!" [...] <b>and</b> Jet <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slope {{to meet the}} {{one person in the}} world whom he {{particularly}} wished to see at that moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had better}} {{try to find}} out," [...] I remarked practically, though I am sure I sympathised with his suspense, <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slope at a run.|$|E
60|$|They {{passed the}} cell again <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{passageway}} {{in the opposite}} direction. Twenty feet further on they reached a wooden door, bolted on the other side.|$|E
6000|$|Ken strode out of {{the room}} <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hall. [...] "Come on!" [...] he called, grimly, and ran down the stairs. Graves hesitated a moment, then followed.|$|E
60|$|Ginger, alert {{after his}} {{unexpected}} fashion {{when it became}} a question of physical action, had followed her through the swing-door, and they emerged together <b>and</b> <b>started</b> running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> square.|$|R
60|$|But {{the little}} man {{believed}} he could shoot {{with the best of}} them, so the next morning he got up early and took his little gun <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> brook to hunt for duck.|$|R
60|$|Mara made a feint {{of eating}} what her {{grandmother}} with fond officiousness would put before her, and then rising up {{she put on}} her sun-bonnet <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> toward <b>the</b> cove to find her old friend.|$|R
60|$|Jim {{strapped}} on his pack <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> valley. He reached the telegraph camp {{three or four}} days afterwards, and in the evening told Jake and Carrie about his interview.|$|E
6000|$|... "It ain't deep," [...] Byrne assured her. [...] "Come ahead; I'll carry yeh acrost," [...] {{and without}} waiting for a reply he {{gathered}} {{her in his arms}} <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> bank.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] he continued, [...] "I {{must return}} to the club-house at once." [...] And without waiting, he turned <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{mountain}} side along the trail by which he had come.|$|E
60|$|He {{lifted her}} upon his horse <b>and</b> <b>started</b> him <b>down</b> over <b>the</b> rim.|$|R
60|$|He {{sat down}} by a little stream that ran along the roadside, and bathed his aching feet; he washed his face <b>and</b> hands; <b>starting</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill, {{he made his way}} towards the town and entered the gate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so, I will walk," [...] {{and picking}} up the spear {{of one of the}} fallen Umkulu to serve as a staff, she took Noie by <b>the</b> hand <b>and</b> <b>started</b> forward <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{speaking}} {{he took up}} one of the packages, looked {{once more}} to the cartridges in his gun, <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stairs, the boys and Jake following, while Poyor brought up the rear.|$|E
60|$|This {{order was}} given none too quickly, for almost before Bob {{had given his}} {{directions}} to the last man, Massie's party clambered into their wagons, <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road at a sharp gallop.|$|E
60|$|Such {{were some}} of the remarks that came from those in the tonneau of the touring-car, as Dave put on the power <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> winding road which led {{to the bottom of the}} long hill.|$|E
6000|$|They {{were quiet}} enough till he left <b>the</b> trail <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> toward <b>the</b> Bear. Then Johnson cried, [...] "I {{know where it}} is!" [...] and plunged with a whoop into the thicket of willows that bordered the creek.|$|R
6000|$|Jombateeste {{waited to}} hear no more injuries. He said: [...] "You'll don' got money enough, Mr. Durgin, by gosh! to reduce my wages," [...] <b>and</b> he <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill toward Whitwell's house with as great loftiness as could comport with a down-hill gait and his stature.|$|R
60|$|Toby ate {{his breakfast}} very hurriedly, <b>and</b> then <b>started</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{road in the}} {{direction}} of his partners' homes, for he thought there would be a better chance of capturing the runaway if four or five boys set out in pursuit than if he went out alone.|$|R
