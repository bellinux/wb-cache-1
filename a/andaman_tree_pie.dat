5000|$|For years, {{each game}} {{released}} by Infocom contained feelies, or extra objects, in its packaging.

The cartoons generally illustrate several of the types of puzzles in the game, such as [...] "All Alone on a Desserted Isle", which shows a castaway sitting on a tiny island (complete with requisite palm <b>tree)</b> surrounded by <b>pies,</b> cakes, and ice cream. Each cartoon corresponds to a section of the game.|$|R
50|$|Geographically, modern Xanth {{resembles the}} state of Florida in the United States in shape, but has {{landmarks}} that mimic well known geographical features from around the world. One major {{example of this is}} the Gap Chasm, an enormous canyon a mile wide which completely bisects the country, paralleling the DMZ of the Korean Peninsula. The position of the Chasm could also correspond with the Cross Florida Barge Canal, which, similar to the chasm, is generally forgotten except for those who stumble upon it. The Gap is guarded by a resident dragon, known as Stanley Steamer, and is crossed by means of treacherous bridges. Many of Xanth's other geographical features are puns on those of Florida (for example, Lake Ogre-Chobee and the Kiss-Mee River). The Florida Keys also exist, though they are, in Xanth, actual keys. Other punnish features include the Isle of View ("I love you"), Mount Ever-Rest (Mount Everest) and the Centaur Aisle (center aisle) created by a magician from the Centaur Isle. The moon is close enough that flying creatures may land there; the back side is sweet and honeyish, the visible side has turned sour and become curdled cheese, due to observing what has happened on Earth and Xanth. Plants may bear fruit of all descriptions (<b>pie</b> <b>trees</b> and shoe trees are common) or they may be carnivorous (such as the tangle trees), making travel in Xanth risky.|$|R
