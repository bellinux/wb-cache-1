A total of 96 rubies are mounted on the tiara; they were originally part of a necklace given to her in 1947 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>wedding</b> present by the people of Burma (now Myanmar), who credited them with having the ability to protect their owner from sickness and evil.

5|$|Female virtue {{was tied}} to {{literary}} knowledge in the 17th century, leading to a demand for Murasaki or Genji inspired artifacts, known as genji-e. Dowry sets decorated with scenes from Genji or illustrations of Murasaki became particularly popular for noblewomen: in the 17th century genji-e symbolically imbued a bride with an increased level of cultural status; by the 18th century {{they had come to}} symbolize marital success. In 1628, Tokugawa Iemitsu's daughter had a set of lacquer boxes made for her wedding; Prince Toshitada received a pair of silk genji-e screens, painted by Kanō Tan'yū <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>wedding</b> gift in 1649.|$|E

Manohar and his gang assault and rob the son of Thamizhmani, an MP. Divya reports Manohar to the police, and he is arrested. She later learns that Thamizhmani's son had run over a girl with his car, and Manohar stole the money to pay for the girl's medical treatment. Divya feels guilty, and bails him out.|$|E

She tries to show it by wearing the anklets Chandrakumar gave her shortly after their marriage but, irritated by what he sees as Divya's immaturity, Chandrakumar asks her to return to her parents home and books her trip. At the railway station, Chandrakumar gives Divya the divorce papers that she had requested <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>wedding</b> gift.

5|$|Dances can be {{performed}} solo (1, 4); in pairs, (2, 3); in groups, (5, 6, 7); or by massed performers (10). They might be improvised (4, 8) or highly choreographed (1, 2, 5, 10); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, (4); a paying audience (2); a world audience (10); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre (3, 5). They might {{be a part of}} a celebration, such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>wedding</b> or New Year (6, 8); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by warriors like a haka (7). Some dances, such as traditional dance in 1 and ballet in 2, need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the can-can, require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves (9).|$|E

5|$|In 1795, Rowan began {{construction}} of Federal Hill, his family estate, on land that his father-in-law gave him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>wedding</b> present. Due to limited financial resources, {{the time required}} to import building materials from the east, and the craftsmanship required to construct the large home, the mansion was not completed until 1818. After a fire destroyed the log cabin in which the Rowans lived in 1812, they moved into the part of the mansion that was completed, and continued to live there while construction {{on the rest of the}} house was finished. Federal Hill was once believed to be the first brick house constructed in the state of Kentucky, but more contemporary sources give the designation to the William Whitley House, also known as Sportsman's Hill, which was completed in 1794 near Crab Orchard, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Queen Mary asked Garrard & Co. {{to make a}} copy of a tiara {{owned by}} her grandmother, Princess Augusta of Hesse-Cassel, using the queen's own {{diamonds}} and pearls.

Mary left the tiara to Elizabeth II, who later gave it to Diana, Princess of Wales, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>wedding</b> present. She wore it often, notably with her 'Elvis dress' on a visit to Hong Kong in 1989, but on her divorce from Prince Charles it was returned to the Queen. In 2015 and 2016, the Duchess of Cambridge wore it to a diplomatic reception at Buckingham Palace.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{cinematic}} techniques by which von Stroheim portrayed naturalism was animal symbolism. In Greed McTeague {{is associated with}} a canary, only briefly mentioned in the novel. Von Stroheim altered Norris's original ending and has McTeague release the canary in Death Valley. McTeague buys Trina a female canary <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>wedding</b> gift and early in their marriage von Stroheim cuts from a shot of them kissing to birds fluttering wildly in their cage. Another scene with animal imagery includes cross-cutting between a cat attempting to pounce on the canaries in the scene where Schouler bids goodbye to McTeague and Trina without telling them that he has informed on McTeague. Dogs, cats and monkeys are associated with various supporting characters. Von Stroheim also used the naturalist technique of giving characters specific objects, gestures or phrases that repeat throughout the film as a visual leitmotif. For example, Trina tugs on her lips and McTeague fiddles with his birdcage.|$|E
