60|$|DEAR WILLIAM:--Your {{letter of}} the 19th ultimo was {{received}} last night, and for which I am much obliged. The only thing in it that I wish {{to talk to you}} at once about is that because of my vote for Ashmun's amendment you fear that you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> about the war. I regret this, not because of any fear we shall remain disagreed after you have read this letter, but because if you misunderstand I fear other good friends may also. That vote affirms that the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President; and I will stake my life that if you had been in my place you would have voted just as I did. Would you have voted what you felt and knew to be a lie? I know you would not. Would you have gone out of the House--skulked the vote? I expect not. If you had skulked one vote, you would have had to skulk many more {{before the end of the}} session. Richardson's resolutions, introduced before I made any move or gave any vote upon the subject, make the direct question of the justice of the war; so that no man can be silent if he would. You are compelled to speak; and your only alternative is to tell the truth or a lie. I cannot doubt which you would do.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has stated they will not use the fast track negotiating authority (Trade Promotion Authority) to implement ACTA, but the form of a [...] "sole executive agreement" [...] instead. While on 6 March 2012 Legal Adviser of the Department of State Harold Koh refused to back USTR's theory that it could enter any agreement that does not change U.S. law (but binds Congress not to change it) without Congressional consent, Koh described ACTA as a [...] "congressional-executive agreement" [...] that Congress approved of , citing the PRO-IP Act. This proposed method of adoption has encountered criticism in Congress. According to Senator Ron Wyden: [...] "There are questions of constitutional authority surrounding whether the administration can enter into this agreement without Congress's approval ...

5000|$|Two men {{living in}} Dallas who had married in Massachusetts in September 2006, {{identified}} by the courts as J.B. and H.B., filed for a divorce in January 2008 in Dallas County District Court. Their attorney, Peter Schulte, claimed that Article IV Section 1 of the U. S. Constitution, which requires each state to give [...] "full faith and credit" [...] to the legal proceedings of other states, required Texas to recognize a valid Massachusetts marriage. Attorney General Greg Abbott, {{on behalf of the}} state of Texas, moved to intervene to block the divorce, claiming that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. On October 1, 2009, Dallas District Judge Tena Callahan rejected Texas's intervention and held that the Texas Constitution's ban on same-sex marriage, article I, section 32(a), known as Proposition 2, violated the Fourteenth Amendment's due process and equal protection clauses. Schulte commented: [...] "I have a feeling {{there are going to be}} opponents who say this is going to allow the floodgates of gay marriage to open, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> with that. Gay marriage and gay divorce are two separate things." [...] Abbott noted that the definition of marriage that Callahan held unconstitutional had been approved by 75% of Texas voters.

5000|$|Hansen has {{commented on}} the {{relationship}} between the liberal arts and the U.S. business sector in letters to the editor, opinion editorials and articles. She has dismissed arguments brought forward by academics issuing that liberal arts colleges tend to disparage and undermine students who wish to participate in fields such as finance, business, and accounting. Author and 27th president of Dickinson College, William G. Durden charged liberal arts leaders with creating an elitist, “separatist” perspective. Hansen rejected this charge citing the [...] "intellectual and ethical virtues fostered by their undergraduate experience" [...] as a key to their success. She was quoted as saying:Rather than faulting liberal education for failing to prevent greed and corruption in corporate America, we need {{to do a better job}} of communicating what the CEOs who prefer to hire liberal arts graduates already know: Although our expertise rests in academic disciplines and our worth to society has much to do with the intrinsic human need to learn, we have many “practical” programs, and access to the broad learning achieved through a liberal education gives our graduates a realistic understanding of the complexity of the world and prepares them for lives satisfying to themselves and useful to others.Hansen has at times criticized collegiate admission practices stating that although restructuring the admissions platforms most universities use are generally agreed upon, how one is to do this is highly debatable. The shift from de-emphasizing individual performance and achievement, to general “authentically chosen” activities generating “emotional and ethical awareness and skills," [...] is, according to Hansen, [...] "doing more harm than good." [...] She refuted a report issued by the Harvard School of Education which asserted that colleges and universities will have a better pool of students should they choose to admit students based on group activities, putting less value on individual contribution. Hansen asserts that implementing admission standards that focus on these metrics [...] "invites only skepticism and confusion." [...] She notes that admission officers can't reasonably deduce whether a student has an appropriate level of gratitude from a supplementary essay. To implement these subjective metrics would mean dramatic changes to the culture and pedagogy of universities. Hansen states that low-income students can't easily find the specific jobs and work experience required of them to fill subjective and speculative metrics. She goes on to state that [...] "we know too little about how and when to identify, characterize, measure and develop the so-called noncognitive aspects of learning that this report asks colleges to evaluate. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> that the gateway to college is the time or place to subject young people to the full impact of our ignorance about how to fairly assess things they should still be questioning and exploring -- like character, feelings, motives and values." ...|$|E

Weak structure realism, on the other hand, is simply the thesis that the world has one structure (as opposed to none or many), a thesis whose denial leads to various forms of metaphysical pluralism or metaphysical anti-realism.

After the analysis, the item wordings and overall layout of the Internet survey were changed to improve the simplicity, clarity, and reliability of the scale design. The response style of this person-based rating-scale questionnaire was changed. The pilot questionnaire had had a five-statement format: I strongly agree, I agree, I cannot tell, <b>I</b> <b>disagree,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> strongly <b>disagree.</b> This was changed to a bipolar format. Although a 7 -point scale could have been optimal, a bipolar 5 -point Likert type scaling was considered to be acceptable for this paper (see Ajzen [1991], pp 192 – 193). The scale and selection of participants was determined to satisfy the general requirements of continuous scale of measurement and independence of observations in SEM methodology (Babakus et al. [1987]; Clason and Dormody [1994]; Malone and Lubansky [2012]). After revisions to the piloted questionnaire, a Spearman-Brown split-half reliability test (odd-even) was administered in IBM SPSS.
