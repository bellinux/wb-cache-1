500|$|One of the {{earliest}} notable figures from the Milford Haven area is Howell Davis, a pirate born in 1680. He was shot dead in 1719 on the Portuguese island of Príncipe. Other famous residents connected as seafarers include Isaac Davis, a former seaman who was engaged in the fur trade between the Pacific Northwest and China. He became an advisor to Kamehameha I and helped form the Kingdom of Hawaii. Milford Haven has produced, or attracted, several notable artists including Arthur Symons, poet, critic, and an art editor of The Savoy magazine, {{who was born in}} the town in 1865, and Charles Norris, topographical artist, <b>and</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> Historical Account of Tenby, who lived in [...] Milford Haven from [...] 1800 to 1810.|$|E
500|$|Fielding and Gascoyne {{had each}} issued {{contradictory}} pamphlets on the case, {{but it was}} Virtue Hall's testimony, fundamental in the prosecution of Squires and Wells, which became central to Gascoyne's investigation.

[...] A prodigious writer <b>and</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> renowned newspaper column, The Inspector, Hill had squabbled with several of his peers, notably so in Fielding's case, as Fielding had closed that argument in his Covent Garden Journal by stating that [...] "this hill was only a paltry dunghill, and had long before been levelled with the dirt." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1910, it {{was noted}} that the county councils of Essex and Middlesex and the Sheriff's Office of the County of London were all using the same arms.

Colonel Otley Parry, a Justice of the Peace for Middlesex <b>and</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> book on military badges, was asked to devise an addition to the shield.

500|$|In 2013 a Channel 4 {{documentary}} used forensic examiners who digitised {{the original}} nitrate film {{from the three}} cameras present. The film was digitally cleaned and examined. Their examination suggests that Davison intended to throw a suffragette flag {{around the neck of}} a horse or attach it to the horse's bridle. A flag was gathered from the course; this was put up for auction and, as at 2017, it hangs in the Houses of Parliament. Michael Tanner, the horse-racing historian <b>and</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> history of the 1913 Derby, doubts the authenticity of the item. Sotheby's, the auction house who sold it, describe it as a sash that was [...] "reputed" [...] to have been worn by Davison. The seller stated that her father, Richard Pittway Burton, was the Clerk of the Course at Epsom; Tanner's search of records shows Burton was listed as a dock labourer two weeks prior to the Derby. The official Clerk of the Course {{on the day of the}} Derby was Henry Dorling. When the police listed Davison's possessions, they itemised the two flags provided by the WSPU, both folded up and pinned to the inside of her jacket. They measured 44.5 by 27 inches (113 x 69cm); the sash displayed at the Houses of Parliament measures 82 by 12 inches (210 x 30cm).|$|E
500|$|According to the Life of William Marshal, {{which dates}} to soon after 1219, when word reached William Marshal, {{one of the}} richest and most {{influential}} barons, that Richard was dead, he consulted with Walter and discussed whom to support as the next king. Marshal's choice was John, but Walter initially leaned towards John's young nephew Arthur of Brittany. When Marshall was insistent on John, who was an adult, the author of the Life has Walter say in reply [...] " [...] 'So be it then,' said the archbishop, 'but mark my words, Marshal, you will never regret anything in your life as much as this.'" [...] This is almost certainly a retrospective comment that has been inserted into the biography, however, based on John's later behaviour. Once John knew he had the support of Walter and William Marshal, he sent Walter ahead to England to request all free men to pledge fealty to the new king. On 27 May 1199 Walter crowned John, supposedly making a speech that promulgated, for the last time, the theory of a king's election by the people. This story is only contained in the writings of Matthew Paris, however, and although it seems certain that Walter made a speech, it is not certain what the exact contents were. On his coronation day, John appointed Walter Lord Chancellor. W. L. Warren, historian <b>and</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> biography of John, says of Walter that [...] "No one living had a firmer grasp of the intricacies of royal government, yet even in old age his mind was adaptable and fecund with suggestions for coping with new problems." ...|$|E
