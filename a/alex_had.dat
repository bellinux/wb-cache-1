5|$|When Bonnie {{formed on}} May27, {{it became the}} first {{occurrence}} of two pre-season Atlantic storms since 2012, and only the second occurrence since 1951. The first storm, <b>Alex,</b> <b>had</b> formed in January.|$|E
5|$|Alex {{was born}} on July 18, 1992. She grew up in Oakland, California, with her parents Michael and Sita. Her father was an {{alcoholic}} and physically abusive towards his wife. When Alex was in her pre-teenage years, Michael was killed during a violent episode against Sita. The police declined to press charges, unaware that Alex was responsible for Michael's death. Alex was then sent to live with Sita's family in Mumbai, India. Alex returned to the United States, where she enrolled at the FBI Academy in 2015. Unknown to the Bureau, <b>Alex</b> <b>had</b> discovered that {{her father was a}} former FBI agent and had applied to learn more about his past. Alex kept her activities a secret from Sita, telling her mother that she was starting graduate school. A stuffed bear wearing a UC Berkeley sweater can be seen on her desk in the fifteenth episode of the first season, suggesting that she may have attended the University of California, Berkeley, prior to enrolling at Quantico.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} eight, <b>Alex</b> <b>had</b> begun playing both {{basketball}} and football. He would shoot hoops with a soccer ball and a milk crate nailed to a tree. The sport was becoming increasingly popular in Nigeria due {{to the success of}} National Basketball Association (NBA) center Hakeem Olajuwon and Owumi often followed the NBA. When he was 12, his family moved to England, where they lived for three years. They then settled in Boston after his father joined the Harvard School of Public Health. In sixth grade, he enrolled at the local Tobin K-8 School. He attended Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester, Boston, where he played {{basketball and}} football. Owumi later estimated that he lost, at most, nine high school basketball games. At Burke in 2003, he won The Boston Globe Scholar Athlete Award, given to the top male and female student-athletes in Boston. Owumi was also a part of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball team, Boston Amateur Athletic Club.|$|E

5|$|High {{school student}} Alex Browning boards Volée Airlines Flight 180 with his classmates for their senior trip to Paris, France. Before take-off, Alex has a premonition {{that the plane}} will suffer a catastrophic engine failure, causing the plane to explode mid-air and kill {{everyone}} on board. When the events from his vision begin to repeat themselves in reality, he panics and a fight breaks out between Alex and his rival, Carter Horton. This leads to several passengers being removed from the plane, including Alex; Carter; Alex's best friend, Tod Waggner; Carter's girlfriend, Terry Chaney; teacher Valerie Lewton; and students Billy Hitchcock and Clear Rivers. None of the passengers, except for Clear, believe Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on take-off, killing the remaining passengers on board. Afterwards, the survivors are interrogated by two FBI agents, who believe that <b>Alex</b> <b>had</b> {{something to do with}} the explosion.|$|E
5|$|In June 2013, Dimitri {{received}} an Email from his old friend, and former lover, Brooke English. Brooke {{was shocked when}} Dimitri responded by showing up at her door, {{and told him that}} she thought she'd never see him again. Dimitri revealed that he and <b>Alex</b> <b>had</b> divorced, and that he had not bothered remaining in touch with Edmund's family and had reverted to his reclusive ways, but that Europe was beginning to bore him and her timing couldn't have been better. Upon returning to town, he stopped by his former residence, Wildwind, only to find that the place was empty. Brooke explained that after its last occupant, Caleb Cortlandt, had moved out, Sam and Maddie, Edmund's children, had not bothered to rent the mansion out again. Dimitri told Brooke that, while at Wildwind, he stopped by the mausoleum and made amends to Edmund, who had died in a fire 8 years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Claire, {{hoping to}} speed up Alex's {{negotiations}} for a rug, complained about being tired and wanting {{to return to the}} hotel, to pressure the seller into dropping the price faster. This idea backfired, as Alex was forced to buy it when the price was frozen instead. Sir Alan indicated that had Renaissance lost the task by a narrower margin, he would have fired Claire for this, while later stating that, despite his single mistake with the unbranded tajines, <b>Alex</b> <b>had</b> done far better {{than the rest of the}} team.|$|E
5000|$|In the film, <b>Alex</b> <b>has</b> a pet snake. There is {{no mention}} of this in the novel.|$|R

25|$|Alex {{returns to}} his parents' flat, {{only to find that}} they are letting his room to a lodger. Now homeless, he wanders the streets and enters a public library, hoping to learn of a painless method for {{committing}} suicide. The old scholar whom <b>Alex</b> <b>had</b> assaulted in Part 1 finds him and beats him, with the help of several friends. Two policemen come to Alex's rescue, but turn out to be Dim and Billyboy, a former rival gang leader. They take Alex outside of town, brutalise him, and abandon him there. Alex collapses at the door of an isolated cottage, realising too late that it is the one he and his droogs invaded in Part 1. The writer, F. Alexander, still lives here, but his wife has since died of injuries she sustained in the gang-rape. He does not recognise Alex, but gives him shelter and questions him about the conditioning he has undergone. Alexander and his colleagues, all highly critical of the government, plan to use Alex as a symbol of state brutality and thus prevent the incumbent government from being re-elected. Alex inadvertently reveals that he was the ringleader of the home invasion; he is removed from the cottage and locked in an upper-story bedroom as a relentless barrage of classical music plays over speakers. He attempts suicide by leaping from the window.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} episode of series three of Ashes to Ashes, {{the nature of his}} death is raised when Alex Drake discovers a witness {{statement}} implied to have been written by Gene Hunt with various parts blacked out, accompanied by Alex seeing visions of a man with injuries to {{the left side of his}} face dressed in police tunic and greatcoat. In the second episode, DCI Jim Keats, an officer from the Discipline and Complaints department, intent on removing Gene Hunt, states he believes Gene killed Sam Tyler. In the fifth episode, Gene destroys Tyler's clothes (which <b>Alex</b> <b>had</b> requested from Manchester) and the censored file in order to prevent her from learning the truth about his death. In the following episode, a suspect who is not only a known fantasist but appears very different physically from Sam tries to convince Alex that he is Sam Tyler after undergoing extensive plastic surgery, and that he is from the future. He quotes Sam's usual speech in the Life on Mars introductions, claiming that nobody else is real, although he still seems to be pleased when he, Gene and Alex are in the same room, calling them the 'Three Musketeers', and avoiding Alex's attempts to test him for future knowledge by claiming that such details are forgotten after too long in the past. Gene tells Alex that he helped Sam fake his own death, meaning Sam was still alive but had disappeared into thin air.|$|E
500|$|Michael Wolff {{set up a}} {{recording}} session in the music studio along with Nat, Alex, and himself. Draper {{was impressed by the}} recording and contemplated making a mockumentary about the band, presenting the boys as music icons akin to The Beatles. In a TV Guide interview in early 2007, Draper explained, [...] "What originally happened was that Nat and <b>Alex</b> <b>had</b> a band, and the idea evolved based on that. Spinal Tap meets The Little Rascals was my concept... I wanted to have that Help! or A Hard Day's Night kind of feeling." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon {{becoming}} a hurricane, Alex {{was located in}} a moist, low shear environment, which led to steady intensification on June30. The pressure continued to falla sign of an intensifying cyclonewith a more rapid drop occurring that afternoon and evening. The hurricane strengthened into a Category2 storm late on June30 as it approached the northeastern Mexican coast. At 0200 UTC on July1, Alex made landfall at peak strength, with maximum sustained winds of 105mph (165km/h), gusts of 125mph (205km/h) and an unusually low central pressure of [...] in the municipality of Soto la Marina in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. After the storm, the National Hurricane Center revised the landfall intensity estimate, showing Alex was even stronger when it struck the Mexican coast, with sustained winds of 110mph (175km/h) and a central pressure of [...] Several hours after moving ashore, the storm weakened to Category1 status, and its structure began to deteriorate. However, deep convection persisted around the center. By 1200UTC, <b>Alex</b> <b>had</b> weakened into a tropical storm; by 0000UTC July2, the Sierra Madre Oriental disrupted Alex's core, causing the storm to weaken into a tropical depression and dissipate over San Luis Potosí. However, the interaction with the mountain range caused orographic lift {{on the eastern side}} of the storm after the center of circulation had ceased to exist, producing torrential rainfall throughout northern and central Mexico. Following the dissipation of Alex, divergence at the 200mb atmospheric pressure level (approximately at [...] of altitude), a ridge of high pressure located over southern Texas, and Alex's residual moisture interacted to produce intense convection over Nuevo León, Tamaulipas and Coahuila for the next 72hours.|$|E
2500|$|Living in a forested sector, Alex {{builds a}} wooden rake, draws three {{identical}} blueprints, and drops {{them in the}} slots for Bob, Curt and Don. Bob finds {{a piece of wood}} for the handle, but because he lives in a rocky sector, starts making a stone rake head. (<b>Alex</b> <b>had</b> not considered wood to be unavailable or wrong for the rake head, so it was not specified.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Once, Alex {{was given}} several {{different}} colored blocks (two red, three blue, and four green—similar {{to the picture}} above). Pepperberg asked him, [...] "What color three?" [...] expecting him to say blue. However, as <b>Alex</b> <b>had</b> been asked this question before, {{he seemed to have}} become bored. He answered [...] "five!" [...] This kept occurring until Pepperberg said [...] "Fine, what color five?" [...] Alex replied [...] "none". This was said to suggest that parrots, like children, get bored. Sometimes, Alex answered the questions incorrectly, despite knowing the correct answer.|$|E
5000|$|The Trio {{has covered}} 3 Scorpions songs to date, and bandleader <b>Alex</b> <b>has</b> called them [...] "our Rodgers and Hammerstein". http://www.vintageguitar.com/artists/details.asp?ID=229 ...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Alex</b> <b>had</b> a {{vocabulary}} of over 100 words, but was {{exceptional in that}} he appeared to have understanding of what he said. For example, when Alex was shown an object and was asked about its shape, color, or material, he could label it correctly. He could describe a key as a key no matter what its size or color, and could determine how the key was different from others. Looking at a mirror, he said [...] "what color", and learned [...] "grey" [...] after being told [...] "grey" [...] six times. This made him {{the first and only}} non-human animal to have ever asked a question (apes who have been trained to use sign-language have so far failed to ever ask a single question). [...] Alex's ability to ask questions (and to answer to Pepperberg's questions with his own questions) is documented in numerous articles and interviews.|$|E
60|$|<b>Alex.</b> <b>Had</b> I my wish, these tyrants of all nature, Who lord it o'er mankind, should perish,--perish, Each by the other's sword; but, {{since our}} will Is lamely {{followed}} by our power, we must Depend on one; {{with him to}} rise or fall.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] said Queen Bee, {{holding up}} the parcel to Henrietta, who {{came out to the}} porch. [...] "Let us look. O, they have vouchsafed a note!" [...] and she took out a {{crumpled}} envelope, directed in Aunt Mary's handwriting to Fred, on the back of which <b>Alex</b> <b>had</b> written, [...] "Dear B., we beg pardon, but Carey and Dick are going up to Andrews's about his terrier.--A. L." [...] "Very cool, certainly!" [...] said Beatrice, laughing, but still with a little pique. [...] "What a life I will lead them!" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{holidays}} arrived, {{and with}} them Alexander, who, to his great disappointment, was obliged to give up all his generous hopes that Fred {{would be one of}} his competitors for the prize, when he found him able indeed to be with the family, to walk short distances, and to resume many of his former habits; but still very easily tired, and his head in a condition to suffer severely from noise, excitement, or application. Perhaps this was no bad thing for their newly formed alliance, as <b>Alex</b> <b>had</b> numberless opportunities of developing his consideration and kindness, by silencing his brothers, assisting his cousin when tired, and again and again silently giving up some favourite scheme of amusement when Fred proved to be unequal to it. Even Henrietta herself almost learned to trust Fred to Alex's care, which was so much less irritating than her own; and how greatly the Queen Bee was improved is best shown, when it is related, that neither by word nor look did she once interrupt the harmony between them, or attempt to obtain the attention, of which, in fact, she always had as large a share as any reasonable person could desire.|$|E
