Then <b>a</b> third card is revealed, followed by <b>a</b> <b>betting</b> round, <b>a</b> fourth card, <b>a</b> <b>betting</b> round, and finally a showdown.

5|$|The {{object of}} {{blackjack}} {{is for a}} player to defeat the dealer by obtaining a total as close to 21 as possible without accumulating a total that exceeds this number. In blackjack, the standard rule {{is that if the}} player is dealt a pair of identically ranked initial cards, known as a pair, the player is allowed to split them into separate hands and ask for a new second card for each while placing a full initial bet identical to the original wager with each. After placing the wager for the split hands the dealer gives the player an additional card for each split card. The two hands created by splitting are considered independently in competition against the dealer. Splitting allows the gambler to turn a bad hand into one or two hands with a good possibility of winning. It also allows the player to double the bet when the dealer busts. Some rules even allow for resplitting until the player has as many as four hands or allow doubling the bet after a split so that each hand has <b>a</b> <b>bet</b> double the original. The standard rules are that when <b>a</b> <b>bet</b> is doubled on a hand, the player is only allowed to draw one more card for that hand.|$|E
