Focusing on microeconomic aspects of innovation within the endogenous growth literature helps reconsidering the sources and mechanisms of growth.

In the light of recent contributions on public policy analysis, these theoretical models are analysed within the debate on market structures {{and the nature of the}} discovery process.

Amongst the key factors impacting on an individuals preferences over substance use policy are their beliefs about {{the costs and benefits of}} drug use, their own drug use history, and the extent of drug use amongst their peers. We use data from the Australian National Drug Strategy's Household Surveys to study these preferences. We find that current use and past use <b>of</b> cannabis are <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>determinants</b> <b>of</b> being in favor of legalization. We also find that cannabis users are more in favor of legalization the longer they have used cannabis and, among past users, the more recent their own drug using experience. This may be re ecting the fact that experience with cannabis provides information about the costs and benefits of using this substance. We also find some evidence that peers use of cannabis impacts on preferences towards legalization. ...|$|R

Coaxial stacking occurs when two RNA duplexes form a contiguous helix, which is stabilized by base stacking at the interface of the two helices. Coaxial stacking was noted in the crystal structure of tRNAPhe. More recently, coaxial stacking has been observed in higher order structures of many ribozymes, including many forms of the self-splicing group I and group II introns. Common coaxial stacking motifs include the kissing loop interaction and the pseudoknot. The stability of these interactions can be predicted by an adaptation of “Turner’s rules”.|$|E

Labelled drug-related public expenditure showed a positive association with the GDP across the countries considered: r = 0.81 in the case of Health, and r = 0.91 for POS.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} {{by a set of}} cross-country observations on labor productivity growth among industrial countries over the period 1960 - 1997. In particular, we show that over this period, the speed of convergence among industrialized countries has decreased substantially while the negative effect of a country's own employment growth (or labor force growth) on labor productivity has increased dramatically. The main contribution of the paper is to show how these observations are consistent with the view that industrialized countries have been undergoing a particularly drastic technological revolution over the recent past. In effect, we show how the process of endogenous technological adoption, following the diffusion of a general purpose technology, can explain these observations by causing the emergence of an AK accumulation phase where demographic factors temporarily become <b>an</b> <b>major</b> <b>determinant</b> <b>of</b> labor productivity growth. Our estimation of the model implies that the AK phase has been in effect since the early to mid-seventies, but that this phase may now be coming to an end. An important contribution of the paper is to analyze growth experiences across advanced industrialized countries within an open economy framework and to evaluate the explanation by estimating a multicountry dynamic general model. ...|$|R

The results obtained through the estimation of a series of structural VAR models are consistent with this view and indicate also that deflation affected output mainly by increasing real wages.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Fatigue {{is among}} the most {{distressing}} symptoms across the breast cancer continuum. However, {{little is known about the}} factors contributing to long-term persisting fatigue. Therefore, we explored <b>determinants</b> <b>of</b> long-term physical, affective, and cognitive fatigue in a prospective cohort of breast cancer patients. METHODS: Breast cancer patients recruited in a population-based case-control study (MARIE study) provided comprehensive data on sociodemographics, lifestyle, and preexisting medical conditions. At follow-up (median 6. 3 years post-diagnosis, MARIEplus), disease-free cancer survivors (N = 1928) reported current fatigue using a validated multidimensional questionnaire. Additionally, survivors retrospectively rated their fatigue levels before diagnosis, during the treatment phase, and 1 year post-surgery. Linear regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: <b>As</b> <b>major</b> <b>determinants</b> <b>of</b> long-term physical, affective, and cognitive fatigue, multiple regression analyses revealed preexisting psychological or depressive disorders, migraine, analgesic use, peripheral arterial obstructive disease (PAOD), and arthritis. A physically inactive lifestyle and obesity were associated with persisting physical fatigue. Aromatase inhibitors were also associated with long-term fatigue, especially cognitive fatigue. Chemotherapy and, to a lower extent, radiotherapy were major contributors to the development of fatigue during the treatment phase, yet were not associated with long-term fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Although the development of fatigue in breast cancer patients seems largely impacted by cancer therapy, for the long-term persistence of fatigue, preexisting medical or psychological conditions related to depression or pain and lifestyle factors appear to be more relevant. Physicians, psycho-oncologists, and researchers may need to distinguish between acute fatigue during therapy and long-term persisting fatigue with regard to its pathophysiology and treatment...|$|R

Oral health is <b>an</b> <b>major</b> <b>determinant</b> <b>of</b> general health for psychiatric patients and may have a low priority in the context of mental illness. The present study was conducted to assess the oral health status and treatment needs of institutionalized psychiatric patients of Davangere. METHODS : 220 psychiatric patients admitted in two general hospitals of Davangere during the period of one year were included in the study. The oral health status was evaluated with respect to caries, oral hygiene, and periodontal status. RESULTS : Of the 180 examined with the response rate of 81. 8 &#x 0025;. 58. 3 &#x 0025; were males, mean age was 36. 7 years, 57. 8 &#x 0025; had < 1 year of mental illness with a mean of 2. 2 years, and 90 &#x 0025; were self-sufficient. The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the mean DMFT (0. 92) increased with age, duration of mental illness, and irregularity of oral hygiene habits (P< 0. 001). Mean OHI-S score was 3. 3 and multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the mean OHI-S score increased with age (P< 0. 001). The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the CPI score increased with age, duration of mental illness, and degree of helplessness (P< 0. 001).
