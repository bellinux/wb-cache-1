5|$|An {{optional}} query, {{separated from}} the preceding part by a question mark (?), containing <b>a</b> <b>query</b> string of non-hierarchical data. Its syntax is not well defined, but by convention is most often a sequence of attribute–value pairs separated by a delimiter.|$|E
5|$|Hibbard {{wrote that}} the {{condition}} of the mental foramen and masseteric ridges excluded the specimen from Onychomys, Peromyscus, Reithrodontomys, and Eligmodontia and that in these features and in its depth and size, the fossil more closely resembled Oryzomys; therefore, he placed it in that genus with <b>a</b> <b>query.</b> Oryzomys is a living genus that has occurred in the United States since at least 300,000 years ago. In 1966, Philip Hershkovitz wrote that Hibbard had reconsidered his opinion after re-examining ? O.pliocaenicus in 1952; he no longer thought that it was an Oryzomys and instead believed it may be a Bensonomys. The latter genus occurs in the late Miocene and early Pliocene of North America and has been variously interpreted as a close relative of the South American Calomys or merely as an evolutionarily convergent member of the North American subfamily Neotominae. Jon Baskin mentioned the animal in 1978 and 1986, asserting that it cannot be identified to genus level, but may be Bensonomys. Although some continue to list it under Oryzomys, it is now usually excluded from the genus. In 2008, Everett Lindsay listed ? O.pliocaenicus as a questionable species of Jacobsomys, a Pliocene North American genus which he said may be ancestral to Oryzomys.|$|E

25|$|An {{information}} retrieval process begins when a user enters <b>a</b> <b>query</b> into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In {{information retrieval}} <b>a</b> <b>query</b> does not uniquely identify a single {{object in the}} collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of relevancy.|$|E

25|$|The main mode of {{retrieving}} {{data from}} a SQL Server database is querying for it. The query is expressed using a variant of SQL called T-SQL, a dialect Microsoft SQL Server shares with Sybase SQL Server due to its legacy. The query declaratively specifies {{what is to be}} retrieved. It is processed by the query processor, which figures out the sequence of steps that will be necessary to retrieve the requested data. The sequence of actions necessary to execute <b>a</b> <b>query</b> is called <b>a</b> <b>query</b> plan. There might be multiple ways to process the same query. For example, for <b>a</b> <b>query</b> that contains a join statement and a select statement, executing join on both the tables and then executing select on the results would give the same result as selecting from each table and then executing the join, but result in different execution plans. In such case, SQL Server chooses the plan that is expected to yield the results in the shortest possible time. This is called query optimization and is performed by the query processor itself.|$|E
25|$|Subgoals {{encountered}} in <b>a</b> <b>query</b> evaluation are maintained in a table, along with {{answers to these}} subgoals. If a subgoal is re-encountered, the evaluation reuses information from the table rather than re-performing resolution against program clauses.|$|E

40|$|Retrieval in a {{multimedia}} database usually involves com-bining information from different modalities of data, such as text and images.

In this paper, we present an approach to complete <b>a</b> partial <b>query</b> by estimat-ing the missing features in the query. Our experiments with a database of images and their associated captions show that, with <b>an</b> initial text-only <b>query,</b> our completion method has similar performance to <b>a</b> full <b>query</b> with both image and text features.

50|$|The Ranking SVM {{algorithm}} is a learning retrieval function that employs pair-wise ranking methods to adaptively sort results {{based on how}} 'relevant' they are for <b>a</b> specific <b>query.</b> The Ranking SVM function uses a mapping function to describe the match between <b>a</b> search <b>query</b> and the features {{of each of the}} possible results. This mapping function projects each data pair (such as <b>a</b> search <b>query</b> and clicked web-page, for example) onto a feature space. These features are combined with the corresponding click-through data (which can act as a proxy for how relevant a page is for <b>a</b> specific <b>query)</b> and can then be used as the training data for the Ranking SVM algorithm.|$|R
