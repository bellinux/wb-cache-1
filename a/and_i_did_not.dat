Morse commented: [...] "The first {{thing that comes to}} mind is my nose; it was my big idea to do that nose. We didn't have a lot of time, because they asked me to do this about three weeks before they started shooting, and I just kept looking at these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> feel that my face was very commanding in the way his was.

He is currently reprising the role of Washington in voice form as part of The Hall of Presidents show in Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom.|$|E
