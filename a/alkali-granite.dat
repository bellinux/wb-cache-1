40|$|Introduction The Jebale-Barez Plutonic Complex (JBPC) is {{composed}} of many intrusive bodies and {{is located in the}} southeastern province of Kerman on the longitude of the 57 ◦ 45 ' east to 58 ◦ 00 ' and Northern latitudes 28 ◦ 30 ' to 29 ◦ 00 '. The petrologic composition {{is composed}} of granodiorite, quartzdiorite, granite, <b>alkali-granite,</b> and trace amounts of tonalite with dominant granodiorite composition. Previously, the JBPC was separated into three plutonic phases by Ghorbani (2014). The first plutonic phase is {{the main body of the}} complex with composition of quartz-diorite to granodiorite. After differentiation of magma in the magmatic chamber, the porphyritic and not fully consolidated magmas have intruded into the main body. Their compositions were dominantly granodiorite and granite that are defined as the second plutonic phase. Finally, the last phase was started by an intrusion of the holo- leucogranite into the previous bodies. This plutonic activity was pursued by the minor Quaternary basaltic volcanism that shows metamorphic haloes in the contacts. They are dominantly porphyric leucogranites. However, some bodies show dendritic texture that may imply the existence of silicic fluids in the latest crystallization stages. Materials and methods In this article different analysis methods were used. For example, we used a total of two hundred samples of the various granitoids that were selected for common thin section study. Forty four representative samples from the different granitic rocks were selected for whole rock chemical analyses. The analyses of both major and trace elements were performed at the Department of Earth Sciences, the University of Perugia, Italy. The analysis for all major elements was carried out by an X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) using a tube completed with a Rn and W anode under conditions with acceleration voltage of 40 - 45 kV and electric current ranging from I= 30 - 35 mA. After calcination of powdered samples and full matrix correction, the sum of all major oxides was equal to about 100 wt. ...|$|E
40|$|Concentrations {{of boron}} in whole rocks and {{minerals}} of the peralkaline, 1. 16. Ga Ilímaussaq intrusion and its granitic country rocks (South Greenland) were analysed using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and prompt gamma neutron activation (PGNAA) analysis. The intrusion {{consists of an}} early augite-syenite shell, a later <b>alkali-granite</b> sheet and still later nepheline syenites, which dominate the Complex. Boron concentrations are high (250 - 280 μg/g) in all rocks containing fresh sodalite, whereas boron is constantly low in the sodalite-free augite syenites (4 - 6 μg/g) and in the alkali granites (7 - 22 μg/g). Rocks with sodalite altered to analcime contain only low amounts of boron (2 - 7 μg/g), which records boron extraction by late-magmatic fluids. Concentration profiles of B in the analysed minerals (olivine, amphibole, clinopyroxene, aenigmatite, eudialyte, biotite, feldspar, nepheline and sodalite) record magmatic fractionation to various extents, late-magmatic to hydrothermal fluid/rock interaction, and sub-solidus diffusion. Whole-rock concentration data cannot be directly translated into the geochemical evolution of the peralkaline melts, since they are largely affected by cumulate fractionation of sodalite and amphibole and furthermore by late-stage hydrothermal alteration processes resulting in B loss. However, trace-element concentrations of mineral zones representing equilibrium fractionation from magmatic liquids {{can be used in}} combination with mineral-melt partition coefficients to unravel the enrichment processes of elements in the melt. Boron isotope values of minerals from the intrusion and the country rocks resemble the trend observed for Li isotopes in an earlier study. Amphibole and feldspar display a clear trend from light boron in the inner nepheline syenitic part of the intrusion (δ 11 B=- 20 ‰ and - 17 ‰ for amphibole and feldspar, respectively) through intermediate values in the outer augite syenites (δ 11 B=- 10 ‰ and - 6 ‰ for amphibole and feldspar, respectively) to heavy boron with δ 11 B=+ 2 ‰ for amphibole and + 4 ‰ for feldspar in the country rock granites close to the contact with the intrusion. The values are interpreted to reflect the entry of meteoric fluids with heavy B along the intrusive contact. ...|$|E
40|$|The Wanganzhen {{complex is}} one of {{representative}} example of Taihang-Da Hinggan tectonomagmatic belt in eastern China, which as the largest scale adn the most rock types. It consists of three-stage rocks. According to the major element, trace element, REE and ND, SR, PB isotopic characteristics of the Wanganzhen complex reported in this paper, the main stage rocks (Granodiorite, adamellite, and few quartz diorite) have similar petrological and geochemical characteristics to those of adakite with SiO₂≥ 58 %, Al₂O₃≥ 15 %, low Y content (4. 20 ~ 12. 68 μg/g), high SR content (518 ~ 861 μg/g) and Sr/Y ratios (60. 19 ~ 178. 10), LREE enrichment with (La/Yb) N= 34. 06 ~ 76. 91, HREE depletion with Yb=. 044 ~ 1. 00, no obviously Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu*= 0. 83 ~ 1. 03), and relative depletion in the high field strength elements (such as Nb, Hf, Ti), I(Sr) = 0. 7060, negative εNd(t) value (- 16. 29 ~- 14. 27) and positive εSr(t) value (+ 23. 7 ~+ 25. 0), but obviously {{different from those of}} subduction-related adakites. These adakite-like rocks were most likely derived from the partial melting of basaltic lower crust in the thickened crust resulted from hot mantle material upwellins as several mushroom cloud and the thermally altered ground uplifting to the bottom of continental crust during late Jurassic period. But the early and the late stage ones belong to non-adakites. The early basic- to intermediate- instrusive rocks (hornblendite, gabbroite and diorite) are high Mg and Fe, LREE enrichment, EU positive anomaly, enriched in compatible elements and low incompatible elements, I(Sr) = 0. 7056, εNd(t) =- 16. 72 ~- 10. 92, which are the products of partial melting of subcontinental lithospheric enrich mantle and probably represent the underplating basaltic magma below the thickened continental crust during early Mesozoic era. The late alkaline intermediate to acid-intrusive rocks (<b>alkali-granite,</b> quartz syenite and quartz monzonite) are characteristic of high K and Na alkaline series and high ΣREE, negative Eu anomaly, low Sr content, high Y and Yb, negative Sr anomaly, I(Sr) = 0. 7062, εNd(t) =- 16. 25, suggesting that the formation of adakite-like rocks of the main stage result in the lithospheric delamination and cause asthenosphere to upwell to the bottom of thinned continental crust, so the rocks of the late stage are formed by the partial melting of the materials in the crust-mantle transformation belt even in the middle crust. In this paper the Rb-Sr isochronal age of granodiorite (145. 7 ± 5. 3 Ma) is reported. Based on the Rb-Sr isochronal age of granite and granidiorite, {{the main body of the}} Wanganzhen complex was probably formed in late Jurrasic period between 137. 8 Ma and 145. 6 Ma...|$|E
40|$|The basal {{units of}} the {{allochthonous}} complexes of NW Iberia are {{used to examine the}} Lower Paleozoic geodynamic evolution of the northern Gondwana margin. These units represent the most external continental margin and the sequence of major magmatic events that affected them has been dated. Isotopic dating and field data highlight the existence of two magmatic pulses, dated at 489 ± 4 Ma (granodiorites) and 474 ± 3 Ma (<b>alkali-granites),</b> and a slightly younger alkaline/peralkaline pulse, dated at ca. 470 – 475 Ma (alkaline and peralkaline granites). Their framing into the regional background has allowed us to explore the major lithosphere-scale processes developed at the Gondwana periphery at that time, as well as to conceive a consistent model for the opening of the Rheic Ocean that reconciles the timing of sea opening and back-arc extension with the timing of intracontinental rifting. The sequence of events is framed in a Cambrian and Ordovician peri-Gondwanan subduction setting where we also explore how subduction may be linked to coeval intraplate magmatism far inboard of the arc–trench. This contribution discusses how such a scenario can be traced in basement areas through a modern analog perspective...|$|R
40|$|SW Borneo is {{the southeastern}} {{promontory}} of Sundaland the continental core of SE Asia, previously {{assumed to be}} the oldest part of Borneo. The rocks in SW Borneo are the Pinoh Metamorphic Group (PMG) and granitoids of the Schwaner batholith. The PMG was undated, but previous authors have interpreted it to be Permo-Carboniferous or older. Previous K-Ar studies of granitoid rocks yielded ages between 112 and 75 Ma. U-Pb zircon dating of two granite samples recorded ages between 86 to 79 Ma, and one xenocryst age of 152 Ma. SW Borneo has been widely {{assumed to be a}} crustal fragment which was rifted from the Indochina-China margin and translated to its current location by the Permo-Carboniferous. Recent ly an alternative model has proposed that it was rifted from the NW Australian margin and translated to its current location by the mid-Cretaceous. This study has involved detailed fieldwork, with petrographic, geochemical, metamorphic petrology, U-Pb and Ar-Ar geochronology studies. The aims of the project were to: 1. Determine petrographic and geochemical characteristics of Schwaner granitoids. 2. Constrain age of emplacement. of the Schwaner batholith. 3. Identify protoliths and style of metamorphism of PMG rocks. 4. Date protolit hs and metamorphic history of the PMG. 5. Determine the role of SW Borneo in the tectonic evolution of Sundaland. Granitoids in SW Borneo are I-type. In the Southern Schwaner Mountains (SSZ) they are withinplate granitoids, typically <b>alkali-granites,</b> with U-Pb zircon ages of c. 186 and 76 Ma. In the Northern Schwaner Mountains (NSZ) they are arc-related granitoids, typically tonalites and granodiorites. U-Pb zircon ages show four significant age populations of c. 112, 98, 84, and 76 Ma. The PMG comprises metamorphosed pe lites, quartzites and basalts, which formed a thick volcanic-sediment pile. Metapelites are hornfelses, phyllites and schists. Low pressure regional metamorphism (c. 3 - 4 kbar, 500 - 625 °C) with localised contact metamorphism resulted from intrusion of granitoid rocks. Later shear zones cut older metamorphic fabrics. U-Pb dating of zircon shows metamorphic protoliths of the PMG are younger than 130 Ma. Ar-Ar geochronology of biotite and white mica indicate that peak regional metamorphism took place at c. 110 Ma. Post-metamorphic shearing took place at 25 Ma. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The Kuboos-Bremen Igneous Province {{comprises}} {{a linear}} zone of alkaline complexes that intrude Proterozoic and Pan-African rocks and trends in a northeast {{direction from the}} northwest of the Cape Province in South Africa into southern Namibia. Of the three most southerly complexes in Namibia. two comprise silicate rocks ranging from nepheline syenite to <b>alkali-granite</b> and are called the Grootpenseiland and Marinkas Kwela Complexes (GPC and MKC). The Marinkas Kwela Carbonatite Complex is the third and most northerly of the complexes. Isotopic age determinations {{on a number of}} rock types from both the silicate complexes yield ages around 520 Ma and are consistent with published Pan-African ages for the Province. Each silicate complex shows a migrating locus of intrusion from Siundersaturated rocks in the southwest to Si-oversaturated rocks in the northeast. The complexes overlap in outcrop. The rocks are moderately to highly felsiC and none reflects primary magma compositions. The Si-undersaturated rocks from both complexes include side-wall cumulates formed from magmas that fractionated alkali-feldspar, clinopyroxene and amphibole. Foyaites also occur in the MKC and have a compositional range reflecting alkali-feldspar fractionation and, probably, some interaction with dolomite country rocks. Major and trace element data suggest that critically saturated alkali syenites occurring in both complexes evolved via protracted feldspar fractionation, and that critically saturated alkali-feldspar syenite occurring only in the GPC is a cumulate. The two rock types cannot be related genetically. Of the SI-oversaturated rocks in both complexes, those in the compositional range monzonite to granite were intruded before alkali-granites. Compositional diversity amongst the former reflects fractionation of feldspar and of mafic phases, but that process cannot genetically link the rocks to the alkali-granites. Isotopic compositions of Sr and Nd indicate that the silicate magmas were derived from an upper mantle source region characterised by low time-integrated Rb/Sr ratios and high time-Integrated Sm/Nd ratios, However, the evidence of Sr and 0 isotopic data is that the Si-oversaturated melts possibly interacted with a crustal component. presumably the Proterowlc rocks of the Namaqua Metamorphic Province. This interaction may explain the occurrence of apparently co-genetic rock series that evolved {{on opposite sides of the}} feldspar join in Petrogeny's Residua System. The Marinkas Kwela Carbonatite Complex was emplaced before the final intrusive phases of the MKC and exhibits unusually pronounced late-stage enrichment in manganese. The earliest intrusive rocks in the complex were nepheline syenites which were fenitised by later intrusions of sôvites. Although the commonly occurring magmatic sequence of sôvite-beforsite-ferrocarbonatite is observed at Marinkas Kwela, sôvites do not appear to have been parental to beforsites. Removal of apatite and early crystallisation of magnetite distinguish magnetite-rich beforsite from co-genetic apatite-rich beforsite. Two further magmatic sequences. the first from apatite-rich beforsite through ferrocarbonatite to Mn-rich ferrocarbonatite (high Fe/Mn) and the second from magnetite-rich beforsite to Mn-rich ferrocarbonatite (low Fe/Mn). reflect fractionation of dolomite and of dolomite+magnetite respectively. ...|$|E
