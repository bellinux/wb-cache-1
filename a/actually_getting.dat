5|$|Officially, {{the only}} {{acceptable}} religious doctrines in Prague were Catholic and Utraquist, but Kepler's {{position in the}} imperial court allowed him to practice his Lutheran faith unhindered. The emperor nominally provided an ample income for his family, but the difficulties of the over-extended imperial treasury meant that <b>actually</b> <b>getting</b> hold of enough money to meet financial obligations was a continual struggle. Partly because of financial troubles, his life at home with Barbara was unpleasant, marred with bickering and bouts of sickness. Court life, however, brought Kepler into contact with other prominent scholars (Johannes Matthäus Wackher von Wackhenfels, Jost Bürgi, David Fabricius, Martin Bachazek, and Johannes Brengger, among others) and astronomical work proceeded rapidly.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot at Pinewood Studios at its 007 Stage in the UK, as well as Weissensee in Austria. The pre-title {{sequence}} was filmed on the Rock of Gibraltar and although the sequence shows a hijacked Land Rover careering down various sections of road for several minutes before bursting through a wall towards the sea, the location mostly used the same short stretch of road {{at the very top}} of the Rock, shot from numerous different angles. The beach defences seen at the foot of the Rock in the initial shot were also added solely for the film, to an otherwise non-military area. The action involving the Land Rover switched from Gibraltar to Beachy Head in the UK for the shot showing the vehicle <b>actually</b> <b>getting</b> airborne. Trial runs of the stunt with the Land Rover, during which Bond escapes by parachute from the tumbling vehicle, were filmed in the Mojave Desert, although the final cut of the film uses a shot achieved using a dummy. Other locations included Germany, the United States, and Italy, while the desert scenes were shot in Ouarzazate, Morocco. The conclusion of the film {{was shot at}} the Schönbrunn Palace, Vienna and Elveden Hall, Suffolk.|$|E

For example, they see a stream of pure, clear water in the distance, but {{by the time they get}} there the stream has dried up. Hungry ghosts have huge bellies and long, thin necks. On the rare occasions that they do manage to find something to eat or drink, the food or water burns their neck as it goes down to their belly, causing them intense agony.|$|E
25|$|Countries where {{fixed rate}} loans are the {{common form of}} loan for a house {{purchase}} usually {{need to have a}} specific legal framework in place to make this possible. For example, in Germany and Austria the popular Bausparkassen, a type of mutual building societies, offer long-term fixed rate loans. They are legally separate from banks and require borrowers to save up a considerable amount, at a rather low fixed interest rate, before they get their loan; this is done by requiring the future borrower to begin paying in his fixed monthly payments well before <b>actually</b> <b>getting</b> the loan. It is generally not possible to pay this in as a lump sum and get the loan right away; {{it has to be done}} in monthly installments of the same size as what will be paid during the payback phase of the mortgage. Depending on whether there are enough savers in the system at any given time, payout of a loan may be delayed for some time even when the savings quota has already been met by the would-be borrower. The advantage for the borrower is that the monthly payment is guaranteed never to be increased, and the lifetime of the loan is also fixed in advance. The disadvantage is that this model, in which you have to start making payments several years before <b>actually</b> <b>getting</b> the loan, is mostly aimed at once-in-a-lifetime home buyers who are able to plan ahead for a long time. That has become a problem with the generally higher mobility that is demanded of workers nowadays.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of cases, a no-hitter is also recorded as a shutout if it is performed by a single pitcher pitching a complete game. If a no-hitter is achieved {{with more than one}} pitcher, no pitcher is awarded a shutout or a no-hitter, but a team shutout and no-hitter is still acknowledged. It is possible under rare circumstances for a no-hitter to not be a shutout (either individually or a combined effort). If the opposing team manages to score through a series of errors, sacrifice flies, hit batsman, or base on balls, the no-hitter remains intact while the shutout is lost. Since 1875, there have been 281 recorded no-hitters, {{and the vast majority of}} these have been completed by a single pitcher. Of that number, 24 instances resulted in a no-hitter that was not a shutout since the other team managed to score without <b>actually</b> <b>getting</b> a hit. Of these, there have only been two instances where the team that achieved no hits in the game actually won. One of these games was a combined no-hitter loss accomplished by more than one pitcher, and there has only been one recorded instance in history where a single pitcher lost a complete game no-hitter.|$|E

The finished setlist would include three songs from Circus, six songs from Blackout and five songs from In the Zone (2003); {{other parts of the}} setlist consist of a medley of [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] and [...] "Touch of My Hand", both from In the Zone; and a remix of [...] "...Baby One More Time", the only song performed off the album of the same name (1998). [...] "Everytime" [...] was the only song not included in the released setlist but was performed regularly on the show.

500|$|One {{method was}} by {{introducing}} overarching themes that individual episodes could be tied to, such as [...] "The Pattern" [...] in Season 1, providing information repeatedly about the larger plot {{over the course}} of several episodes or seasons. Abrams also created characters whose alliances to the larger narrative were clear, avoiding a similar problem that had occurred during the first and second seasons of Alias. [...] A final step taken was to script out all of the major long-running plot elements, including the show's finale, prior to full-time production. [...] Abrams contrasted this to the process used in Lost, where ideas like character flashbacks and the hatch from the second season were introduced haphazardly and made difficulties in defining when they should be presented to the viewers. Instead, with Fringe, they were able to create [...] "clearly defined goalposts" [...] (in Itzkoff's words) that could be altered as necessary with network and seasonal changes but always provided a clear target for the overarching plot. These approaches also allowed the team to introduce unique plot elements to be introduced in time that would have altered the show's fate if known at the start. Abrams stated that [...] "There are certain details that are hugely important that I believe, if shared, will destroy any chance of <b>actually</b> <b>getting</b> on the air." [...] Abrams noted that they are able to benefit from [...] "how open Fox as a network has been to a show that is embracing the weirdness and the long-term stories that we want to tell". During the third season, executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that [...] "We have six to eight seasons worth of material. We see it as having certain chapters that would enrich the overall story, but aren't necessary to tell the overall story. God willing, the network allows us the time to tell our complete story." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé's {{version of}} [...] "Resentment" [...] {{received}} positive reviews from critics, {{most of whom}} noted the soulful vocal stylings used in the song. Bill Lamb of About.com complimented the song {{as one of the}} album highlights and described it as [...] "gospel-influenced" [...] and [...] "emotion filled" [...] song. A writer of Billboard magazine stated that Beyoncé [...] "shifts into emotive mode" [...] on this song from [...] "rockier, edgier" [...] sound of album and noted that the track [...] "calls to mind the subtle fervor and passion of the best girl groups of the '60s and '70s". Brian Hiatt from Rolling Stone marked the track as [...] "one of the most arresting moments" [...] on the album and described it as an [...] "anguished, sixties-tinged ballad". Spence Abbott of IGN also noted track as a stand out alongside [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and observed that [...] " [...] track goes straight for Aretha Franklin-inspired territory, with Beyoncé <b>actually</b> <b>getting</b> gritty and dropping her high octave range down a few pegs to get guttural and downright Old School soulful". Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that the [...] "agitated goodbye" [...] builds a different kind of overwrought drama. Steve Jones of USA Today the song showcases Beyoncé's [...] "maturing vocal chops," [...] describing the song as spare and gritty. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song would have been better if performed by a trio of [...] "talented" [...] vocalists, such as Destiny's Child, rather than Beyoncé by herself. Houston Chronicles Joey Guerra felt that [...] "Doubters of Beyoncé's immense talent need only give one listen to this track [...] from 2006's B'Day. It's a stunner — a visceral, emotional showcase that casts Beyoncé as a scorned, sorrowful woman. You can almost feel the pain in her delivery." [...] According to a writer of Irish Independent, the song gives a more soulful feel to B'Day. Jim Farber of Daily News called [...] "Resentment" [...] an [...] "old-school soul shouter". Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker described the song as a [...] "fierce ballad". [...] "Resentment" [...] peaked at number 11 on the US Bubbling Under R/Hip-Hop Singles chart, which acts as an extension to the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs.|$|E

2500|$|Critic Stephanie Zacharek of Salon {{states that}} [...] "this {{adaptation}} of Cormac McCarthy's novel touches on brutal themes, but never really gets its hands dirty. The movie's violence isn't pulpy and visceral, {{the kind of}} thing that hits like a fist; it's brutal, and rather relentless, but there are still several layers of comfortable distance between it and us. At one point a character lifts his cowboy boot, daintily, so it won't be mussed by the pool of blood gathering at his feet ... The Coens have often used cruel violence to make their points– that's nothing new– but putting that violence to work in the service of allegedly deep themes isn't the same as <b>actually</b> <b>getting</b> your hands dirty. No Country for Old Men feels less like a breathing, thinking movie than an exercise.
