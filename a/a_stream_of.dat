5|$|Titanium powder is {{manufactured}} using a {{flow production}} {{process known as}} the Armstrong process {{that is similar to}} the batch production Hunter process. <b>A</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> titanium tetrachloride gas is added to <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> molten sodium metal; the products (sodium chloride salt and titanium particles) is filtered from the extra sodium. Titanium is then separated from the salt by water washing. Both sodium and chlorine are recycled to produce and process more titanium tetrachloride.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field, predominantly dipolar at its surface, is distorted {{further out}} by the solar wind. This is <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> charged particles leaving the Sun's corona and accelerating to a speed of 200 to 1000kilometres per second. They carry with them a magnetic field, the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).|$|E

5|$|Gallium also forms sulfides {{in lower}} {{oxidation}} states, such as gallium(II) sulfide {{and the green}} gallium(I) sulfide, the latter of which is produced from the former by heating to 1000°C under <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|In {{day-to-day life}} {{all of us}} observe that <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> water {{emerging}} from a faucet will break up into droplets, no matter how smoothly the stream is emitted from the faucet.

5|$|Uncommonly for Indonesian {{literature}} {{during this}} time period, Belenggu chapters were labelled with only a number– other works, such as Abdul Muis' 1928 novel Salah Asuhan (Wrong Upbringing), gave both a number and subtitle to the chapters. According to Taum, this change in style represents <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> consciousness, {{as opposed to the}} earlier style which kept chapters separate.|$|E
5|$|At about 02:30, crewmen aboard Tubantia spotted <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> bubbles rapidly {{approaching}} the ship's starboard side, {{followed by an}} explosion. The ship quickly began sinking. Distress calls sent out by Tubantia were answered by three ships, Breda, Krakstau, and La Campine, which between them rescued all 80 passengers and all 294 members of the crew. The ship and her cargo were a total loss. Tubantia was the largest neutral vessel sunk during the entire war.|$|E

5|$|Bohr became {{convinced}} that light behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, experiments confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves. He conceived the philosophical principle of complementarity: that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties, such as being a wave or <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> particles, depending on the experimental framework. He {{felt that it was}} not fully understood by professional philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Bohr {{developed}} the Bohr {{model of the}} atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|During an {{encounter}} with Jupiter in 1992, the Ulysses spacecraft detected <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> dust-sized particles being ejected from the Jovian system. The dust in these discrete streams travels away from Jupiter at speeds upwards of several hundred kilometres per second, has an average particle size of 10μm, and consists primarily of sodium chloride. Dust measurements by Galileo showed that these dust streams originate from Io, but exactly how these form, whether from Io's volcanic activity or material removed from the surface, is unknown.|$|E

5|$|For interception, {{the radar}} {{operator}} had {{to compare the}} length of the blips on the displays. If the blip was slightly longer on the right than left side of the azimuth display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to turn right in an effort to centre the target. Interceptions normally resulted in <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Crawford starred {{opposite}} Ramón Novarro in Across to Singapore, {{but it was}} {{her role}} as Diana Medford in Our Dancing Daughters (1928) that catapulted her to stardom. The role established her as a symbol of modern 1920s-style femininity which rivaled Clara Bow, the original It girl, then Hollywood's foremost flapper. <b>A</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> hits followed Our Dancing Daughters, including two more flapper-themed movies, in which Crawford embodied for her legion of fans (many of whom were women) an idealized vision of the free-spirited, all-American girl.|$|E
5|$|In July, while Fuentes was busied in {{the siege}} of Doullens, Maurice of Nassau, statholder of the Dutch Republic, {{assembled}} a force of 6,000 infantry, some cavalry companies and 16 artillery pieces of the Dutch States Army, and led them under the walls of Groenlo, a medium-sized town in the County of Zutphen. Its northern flank defended by the Slinge, <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> the Berkel river, Groenlo was fortified with five bulwarks and garrisoned by 11 infantry companies from Count Herman van den Bergh's regiment numbering 600 troops under Jan van Stirum, a German officer, and four small artillery pieces.|$|E

5|$|In the air, {{there were}} also two {{competing}} designs, originating from groups of different backgrounds and needs. The Army Signal Corps, representing military aviators, preferred a solution based on <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> audio navigation signals, constantly fed into the pilots' ears via a headset. Civilian pilots on the other hand, who were mostly airmail pilots flying cross-country to deliver the mail, felt the audio signals would be annoying and difficult to use over long flights, and preferred a visual solution, with an indicator in the instrument panel.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> famous {{visitors}} came to view Staffa's wonders including Robert Adam, Sir Walter Scott (1810), John Keats (1818), J. M. W.

Wordsworth, however, found {{the volume of}} tourism disappointing.|$|E
5|$|That same year, J.J. Thomson {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} which he channeled <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> neon ions through magnetic and electric fields, striking a photographic plate at the other end. He observed two glowing patches on the plate, which suggested two different deflection trajectories. Thomson concluded this was {{because some of the}} neon ions had a different mass. The nature of this differing mass would later be explained by the discovery of neutrons in 1932.|$|E

In this study, the bubble rise velocity (BRV) inside an inclined pipe and the liquid flow needed to bull-head <b>a</b> continuous <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> gas are investigated.|$|R
