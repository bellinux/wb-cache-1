50|$|A CRT {{computer}} monitor {{with a low}} refresh rate (<70Hz) or a CRT television can cause similar problems because the image has a visible flicker. Aging CRTs also often go slightly out of focus, and this can cause eye strain. LCDs do not go out of focus but are also susceptible to flicker if the backlight for the LCD uses PWM for dimming. This causes the backlight to turn {{on and off for}} shorter intervals as the <b>display</b> becomes <b>dimmer,</b> creating noticeable flickering which causes eye fatigue.|$|R
40|$|With {{advances}} in computer technology, complex applications {{are being developed}} which involve multi-window operations.

A significant portion of the user's time is spent in opening/closing or moving/resizing the windows. Since these window interface housekeeping activities are not directly related to the user's task domain, time spent on window management causes an increase in the actual task completion time, resulting in reduced user throughput. We propose the A 2 DL (Adaptive <b>Automatic</b> <b>Display</b> Layout) system, which performs window management functions to free the user's cognitive and temporal resources to work on task domain activities rather than managing the multi-window desktop.

Both MOS capacitors and transistors with double-layer films as gate insulation revealed the best characteristics.

40|$|Introduction. Splenic tumor {{is usually}} found as an {{incidental}} finding on CT of abdomen. Traditionally, ultrasound (US) or computed tomography (CT) guided biopsies were employed {{for the purpose}} of sampling; however they have been reported to have a complication rate of 5. 3 %. Endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has been recently utilized {{for the purpose of}} sampling splenic tumors. In literature there are 7 reported instances where splenic lymphoma was diagnosed using EUS-FNA. We present a case of follicular B cell lymphoma of the spleen diagnosed using EUS-FNA. Case Report. 58 -year-old female presented to her primary care physician for left upper quadrant abdominal pain for one week. Physical exam was significant for left upper quadrant tenderness. Her laboratory tests were within normal limits. She underwent CT scan of abdomen which revealed approximately 5 [*]cm × 5 [*]cm mass in spleen. EUS-FNA of the spleen revealed a large hypoechoic, heterogeneous, well-demarcated mass measuring 54. 7 [*]mm × 43. 0 [*]mm. Fine needle aspiration was performed, and the sample was submitted for cytology and flow cytometry. Flow cytometry revealed a lambda monotypic population of B cells <b>displaying</b> <b>dim</b> CD 19 and CD 10. Diagnosis of B cell non-Hodgkin low grade follicular lymphoma was made. Conclusion. Endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration is a very rare but safe, reliable method of diagnosis of splenic lymphomas...|$|R
