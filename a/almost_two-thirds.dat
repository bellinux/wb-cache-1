Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to Halloween as a reason to delay the change—to provide extra daylight on October 31.|$|E
5|$|While {{mercury and}} zinc {{minerals}} {{are found in}} large enough quantities to be mined, cadmium is too similar to zinc and therefore is always present in small quantities in zinc ores from where it is recovered. Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States with the largest reserves in Iran. At {{the current rate of}} consumption, these reserves are estimated to be depleted sometime between 2027 and 2055. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and one estimate found that about 109 million tonnes of that remains in use. In 2005, China was the top producer of mercury with <b>almost</b> <b>two-thirds</b> global share followed by Kyrgyzstan. Several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents. Because of the high toxicity of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Groucho Marx played Waldorf T. Beagle (later renamed Waldorf T. Flywheel), and Chico played Emmanuel Ravelli, {{the same}} name as the Italian {{character}} {{he played in the}} film Animal Crackers (1930). Mary McCoy played secretary Miss Dimple, and it is thought that Broderick Crawford also appeared as various characters. Groucho and Chico shared a weekly income of $6,500 for appearing in the show. During the Great Depression, this was considered a high sum for 30 minutes' work, especially since radio scripts required no memorization and only a few minutes were needed for costume, hair and makeup. By comparison, Greta Garbo's weekly salary from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer during the same period was also $6,500, though this was for a 40- or 50-hour week. Wynn was paid $5,000 a week for Fire Chief. In contrast, <b>almost</b> <b>two-thirds</b> of American families were living on fewer than $26 a week. In a classic Marxian twist, Harpo was paid a weekly salary for not appearing on the show, even though his mute character would have little to do in a radio program anyway.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Transportation {{models have}} not been {{adequate}} in addressing severe long-term urban transportation problems that transportation disadvantaged groups overwhelmingly encounter, and the negative impacts of transportation on the disadvantaged {{have not been}} effectively considered in the modeling studies. Therefore this paper aims to develop a transportation modeling approach {{in order to understand}} the travel patterns of the transportation disadvantaged, and help in developing policies to solve the problems of the disadvantaged. Effectiveness of this approach is tested in a pilot study in Aydin, Turkey. After determining disadvantaged groups by a series of spatial and statistical analyses, the approach is integrated with a travel demand model. The model is run for both disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged populations to examine the differences between their travel behaviors. The findings of the pilot study reveal that <b>almost</b> <b>two-third</b> of the population is disadvantaged, and this modeling approach could particularly be useful in disadvantage-sensitive planning studies to deploy relevant landuse and transportation policies for disadvantaged groups...|$|R
40|$|Findings of {{a singing}} {{experiment}} {{are presented in}} which trained and untrained singers sang melodies of familiar and less familiar Beatles songs from memory and after listening to the original song on CD. Results showed that adopting the correct pitch of a melody was done better by trained singers, and only after listening to the song. Contours of melodies were equally well reproduced by both trained and untrained singers. In contrast, the intervals of a melody were sung more accurately by trained singers than by untrained singers. These findings demonstrate the dominance of contour for remembering melodies and the poorer interval encoding of melodies {{or the lack of}} essential singing skills by untrained singers. When singing from memory, <b>almost</b> <b>two-third</b> of the singing came reasonably close to the actual tempo on the CD. This improved to more than 70 % after listening to the song on CD. In general, the singing of less familiar melodies improved after song listening. Implications for ‘query by humming’ applications are discussed. ...|$|R

30|$|Bioprospecting {{of biomass}} towards {{establishment}} of bio-refineries for augmentation of commodity chemicals and fuel generation warrants mandatory attention. Lignocellulosic (LC) biomass, locally available in plenty, requires less capital investments for bioconversion, reduces {{greenhouse gas emission}} and creates employment opportunities in rural livelihood. <b>Almost</b> <b>two-third</b> of the lignocellulosics are comprised of cellulose (40 – 50 %), hemicelluloses (25 – 35 %) and lignin (15 – 20 %). Hydrolytic enzymes are very crucial to break the complex biomass into macromolecules and then into simple sugars, towards the production of biomass-derived sugars, bioproducts and biochemicals. The total cellulase system consists of three enzymatic activities: (i) Endo-β- 1, 4 -d-glucanase (EC 3.2. 1.4) which randomly cleaves accessible intermolecular β- 1, 4 glycosidic bonds {{on the surface of}} cellulose. (ii) Exoglucanase (CBH, EC 3.2. 1.91) that cleaves cellobiose units from both reducing and non-reducing end of cellulose chains. (iii) Finally, β-glucosidases (BG, EC 3.2. 1.91) that hydrolyze the remaining glycosidic bonds to form glucose, which can then simultaneously or in a separate step get converted to the desired product by a fermenting biocatalyst.|$|R
40|$|Plasmalogens (Pls) {{represent}} a specific subclass of glycerophospholipids {{characterized by the}} presence of a vinyl-ether bond at the sn- 1 position of glycerol. Pls are quantitatively important in membranes of neuronal tissues, including the brain and the retina, where they can represent until <b>almost</b> <b>two-third</b> of ethanolamine glycerophospholipids. They are considered as reservoirs of polyunsaturated fatty acids as several studies have shown that arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids are preferentially esterified on Pls when compared to other glycerophospholipids. Reduced levels of Pls were observed in a number of neurodegenerative disorders such as glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. In a mouse model of Pls deficiency, "glaucoma-like" optic nerve abnormalities were observed as well as developmental defects in the eye. These included microphthalmia, dysgenesis of the anterior segment of the eye, and abnormalities in retinal vessel architecture. Several data from animal and in vitro studies suggest that Pls may be involved in the regulation of retinal vascular development through the release of polyunsaturated fatty acids by a calcium-independent phospholipase A 2.

30|$|In this study, we {{describe}} the production of secrete heterologous protein SubC in L. lactis using the NICE expression system. SubC is the industrially important Carlsberg-type subtilisin (Jacobs 1995) produced by Bacillus licheniformis. Bacterial subtilisins are multipurpose alkaline proteases that are frequently used in industry (Gupta et al. 2002): common variants include subtilisin from B. amyloliquefaciens, highly alkalophilic B. lentus or from B. licheniformis (Rao et al. 1998; von der Osten et al. 1993). Furthermore, Flavobacterium also produces subtilisin (Morita et al. 1998). Interestingly, <b>almost</b> <b>two-third</b> of commercial proteases produced in the world originate from microorganisms (Kumar & Takagi 1999; Tremacoldi et al. 2004). Microbial proteases are classified into different groups, according to their activity in acid, neutral or alkaline conditions, and {{on the characteristics of}} the active site group of the enzyme (Saeki et al. 2007). Subtilisin-like serine proteases are usually secreted extracellulary for searching nutrients (Aehle et al. 2009). One of the features of this class of proteases (subtilases) is an aromatic or hydrophobic residue, such as leucine, tyrosine or phenylalanine. The highest proteolytic activity is around pH 10, with a molecular weight range of 15 – 40 kDa and an isoelectric point around pI 9. Moreover, the native form of SubC remains fully stable up to 60 °C (Hirata et al. 2003) and it possesses two calcium binding site(s), therefore bound Ca 2 + contributes to enzyme stability (Briedigkeit & Frömmel 1989).|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent {{years have}} seen an {{unprecedented}} increase in funds for procurement of health commodities in developing countries. A major challenge now is the efficient delivery of commodities and services to improve population health. With this in mind, we documented staffing levels and productivity in peripheral health facilities in southern Tanzania. Method: A health facility survey was conducted {{to collect data on}} staff employed, their main tasks, availability {{on the day of the}} survey, reasons for absenteeism, and experience of supervisory visits from District Health Teams. Indepth interview with health workers was done to explore their perception of work load. A time and motion study of nurses in the Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) clinics documented their time use by task. Results: We found that only 14 % (122 / 854) of the recommended number of nurses and 20 % (90 / 441) of the clinical staff had been employed at the facilities. Furthermore, 44 % of clinical staff was not available on the day of the survey. Various reasons were given for this. Amongst the clinical staff, 38 % were absent because of attendance to seminar sessions, 8 % because of long-training, 25 % were on official travel and 20 % were on leave.

40|$|Background: Salmonella {{species are}} among the most common food borne {{pathogens}} worldwide and their infection {{is one of the major}} global public health problems. During the last decade, multidrug-resistant Salmonella species have increased to a great deal, especially in developing countries. The prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Salmonella isolates among food handlers at the University of Gondar, Ethiopia, were described in the current investigation. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to June, 2013 at the University of Gondar. Stool samples from selected volunteer food handlers were collected and analyzed complemented with questionnaire. Standard isolation, identification and biochemical tests were performed to identify Salmonella isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were also carried out on each isolate using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The data was entered into Epi info version 3. 5. 4 and analyzed using SPSS version 21. Result: Out of 423 food handlers participated, 303 (71. 6 %) were females. <b>Almost</b> <b>two-third</b> (71. 4 %) of food handlers had no previous medical checkup to Salmonella infection and only 24 (5. 7 %) of them were certified as food handlers.
