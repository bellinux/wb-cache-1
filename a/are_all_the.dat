5|$|Voalavo {{is a small}} rodent {{resembling}} a mouse with gray fur. Species of the genus are among the smallest known nesomyines, close in size only to Monticolomys koopmani. In terms of external morphology, Voalavo is barely different from Eliurus; fur coloration patterns, general morphology of the feet, and number of mammae (six) <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> same in both genera. However, all species of Eliurus have a pronounced tuft of elongated hairs {{at the tip of}} the tail, a feature that is absent in Voalavo, although the latter does have slightly longer hairs near the tip. The tail is longer than the head and body. Relative tail length in northern voalavo (136% of head and body length) is comparable to that of the longest-tailed species of Eliurus, Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat and Petter's tufted-tailed rat, but V.antsahabensis has a somewhat shorter tail. Furthermore, the pads of the feet are larger in Eliurus, and specifically, the thenar pad (located at the middle of the tarsus) is circular and fairly small in Voalavo, but longer and larger in Eliurus. On the chest, Voalavo species have a gland that produces a sweet-swelling musk in breeding males; this gland is absent in Eliurus. Unlike all other nesomyines but Brachyuromys, Voalavo lacks an entepicondylar foramen, an opening on the humerus (upper forelimb bone).|$|E

25|$|Since {{it would}} be {{difficult}} to use the same rhyme throughout a long poem, sometimes poems were written in stanza form, in the same metre throughout but with each stanza using a different rhyme.

The same statement would hold had the first and second columns been used. This is thus an orthogonal array of strength two.|$|E
