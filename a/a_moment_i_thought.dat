500|$|The puzzle was {{simplified}} in The Shadow of the Templars 2009 [...] by, {{according to}} Cecil, adding a more logical solution. This {{version of the}} game includes a diary, in which the character takes notes; After completing the goat puzzle, George's diary reads: [...] "So the 'ghost of Lochmarne' {{is no more than}} a fierce Billy goat. For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was going to be incredibly awkward to get past, but in the end it was surprisingly simple. Who would have known?", as a reference to the original puzzle's reputation. An easter egg involving a talking goat was included in The Shadow of the Templars sequel, [...] (1997). A goat puzzle was featured in , in the beginning and ending of 2014 second and final episode of the title, as part of the achieved $800,000 Kickstarter [...] "stretch goal".|$|E
2500|$|For {{the third}} {{series of the}} British game show Cluedo, Baker was cast as Professor Plum, a [...] "man {{with a degree in}} suspicion". He was also cast in the 2004 series Strange, as a blind priest who possessed {{knowledge}} of the Devil. Previously, he had appeared as a guest on the quiz show Have I Got News For You and was subsequently described by presenter Angus Deayton as the funniest guest in the series' history. A particular highlight was when Baker gave an anecdotal account of how, while entering a recording studio in Wales, he was accosted {{by a member of the}} public who told Baker: [...] "I will never forgive you, nor will my wife, for what you did to our grammar schools." [...] Baker responded with: [...] "What are you talking about, you daft bugger?" [...] to which the stranger replied: [...] "I'm so sorry. For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you were Shirley Williams." ...|$|E
60|$|FALDER. It was {{all done}} in <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of it afterwards.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not speak}} for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> she was resenting the question.|$|R
6000|$|Madame Merle stared, {{and indeed}} she was justly bewildered. [...] "Ah, <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> ago <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you seemed rather to disparage her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I didn't {{mean that}} for <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>I</b> only <b>thought</b> {{if we could}} get a {{chaplain}} from somewhere,--I'm willing to ride anywhere,--and give poor Hummil a better chance. That's all.' ...|$|R
60|$|For <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> she wavered. A softer {{expression}} {{came over}} her face, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away.|$|E
6000|$|... "You shouldn't slur {{your words}} so. For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you said 'half of one per cent. One {{and a half}} of course you really said.|$|E
6000|$|Jamrach was {{speechless}} for a second. Then he said, like one ashamed [...] "You caught me. I was napping. For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{you were in}} earnest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You couldn't {{have fired}} {{the first shot}} in more {{dramatic}} fashion," [...] she declared. [...] "Even Mr. Phipps lost his nerve for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that Henry was going to collapse altogether. I wonder {{what they are doing}} now." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{closed her}} eyes for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{she was going to}} faint. I was a little {{impatient}} with her; I had not suspected that she was so neurotic a woman. Then I heard Stroeve's voice again. It seemed to break oddly on the silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mary," [...] he said, quietly, [...] "I {{give you}} my word that nothing which I have said this evening has the least {{connection}} with that afternoon. I {{give you my}} word that not for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> have <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of it in connection with what I have said to you to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't imagine any," [...] she replied, [...] "and yet--for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{that you}} were talking artificially. I {{probably}} did you an injustice. I am sorry." ...|$|E
60|$|Upon Wilson's {{coming on}} deck to enter his boat, he was beset on all sides; and, for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> the ship would be seized before his very eyes.|$|E
60|$|John Stumpy {{suddenly}} {{shifted his}} hand from its grasp on the collar to the merchant's throat. For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> Mr. Woodward {{was in danger of}} being choked to death.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not to-day, I think. He is {{not quite}} {{prepared}} to-day. But I wanted to ask whether you could come at <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> notice,--quite at <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> notice. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it better, so that you should know why we sent for you if we did send,--so {{that you might be}} prepared. It could be done here, I suppose?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{considered}} this <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> more soberly. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> might have counted on my fingers {{the number of}} men cognizant of my connection with the case. I decided that he was guessing.|$|R
50|$|Brigadier Gerard’s jockey Joe Mercer:‘Not <b>a</b> <b>moment’s</b> trouble. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> we {{were going}} to win as soon as we went under the five furlong gate‘. ‘I had to waken him up because they {{suddenly}} went an extra length away. But there was never any doubt when he got going. His neck was in front {{a quarter of a mile}} out and that was that’.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not at all, Captain Gills,' {{returned}} Mr Toots. 'I didn't stop <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{you were}} out. But the person said--by the bye, you don't keep a dog, you, Captain Gills?' ...|$|E
6000|$|For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{that his}} bad luck ’ad turned ’is brain. [...] "You’ve got it wrong," [...] I ses, {{as soon as}} I could speak. [...] "She walked out with me." ...|$|E
60|$|For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> {{and then}} sadly shook my head; for though I was sorely tempted to be gone, I {{knew that my}} fate lay in Egypt, and I might not fly my fate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; for <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> At first <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{it quite}} hopeless, but I have unquestionably seen, for <b>a</b> single <b>moment,</b> {{the face that}} I once knew so well. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was {{not until}} the last, that he {{expressed}} the wish; when he could only put his hand upon it, and very indistinctly say to me [...] "your mother." [...] <b>A</b> <b>moment</b> before, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> him wandering in his mind, as he had been for many hours--I think he had no consciousness of pain in his short illness--when I saw him turn himself in his bed and try to open it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew," [...] he remarked, [...] "when {{you came}} back from America. You were alight with it." [...] Then he let his {{bitterness}} gleam for <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you would stick to your bargain." ...|$|R
60|$|For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> she {{was going}} to smile. We were both {{thinking}} of Edwin. But it was only for a moment, and then her face grew cold once more, and the chin resumed its angle of determination.|$|E
60|$|He put {{his hand}} into his pocket, and for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{he was about to}} produce a weapon too, but instead of that he whipped out a {{cigarette}} and lit it, breathing the smoke rapidly into his lungs.|$|E
60|$|The {{breeze and}} the gentle {{motion of the}} boat were delightful, and for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> how {{pleasant}} a life on the ocean must be. Alas! little did I realize what was in store for me on the boundless deep.|$|E
5000|$|In {{her book}} The Kennedy Chronicles, former MTV VJ Kennedy {{claimed that the}} song was {{actually}} about her complicated relationship with Rzeznik, with the lyrics referring to their time together and her full name being a secret to most. Rzeznik admitted to the inspiration in the book, saying [...] "I was trying to capture a moment...it was pretty interesting to have a song inspired by <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{it was a very}} sweet song." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't say,' he said honestly. 'I suppose {{just for}} <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> must have <b>thought</b> you had really got into some serious sort of scrape. I don't see how I {{could have helped}} it. I am sure I should never have thought you had done {{anything}} really wrong.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] said Barker eagerly, [...] "you don't understand. I {{proposed}} {{to her because}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was rich. In <b>a</b> foolish <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had discovered that some old stocks I had had acquired a fabulous value. She believed it, too, but because she <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was now a rich man and she only a poor girl--a mere servant to her father's guests--she refused me. Refused me because she <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> might regret it in the future, because {{she would not have}} it said that she had taken advantage of my proposal only when I was rich enough to make it." ...|$|R
60|$|About twelve o'clock {{one night}} {{one of the}} alarms (that on the kitchen window) went off with a whirr and a wild {{succession}} of clangs. For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> the morning train had arrived, and then I woke up. Euphemia was already under the bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, but you startled me so, and really for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{that you were}} the spirit of the place, or," [...] he added, gracefully, {{pointing}} to a branch of half-opened hawthorn bloom she held in her hand, [...] "the original Queen of the May." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sort {{of man who}} can see {{no further}} than his nose," [...] he remarked contemptuously. [...] "Fearful old fogey! I can't imagine any sister of yours putting up with him for <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps you were staying with them, as you did not seem {{particularly}} anxious to recognize your old friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>A</b> <b>moment</b> since, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> her alluring; {{this speech}} concluded, I looked on her with distaste. [...] "Just like you," [...] was my cold answer. [...] "And {{in this way}} you have ousted Mdlle. Henri? You wanted her office, {{therefore}} you rendered it intolerable to her?" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was indeed}} time, {{for the day}} was drawing toward its close. For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> we would give Mr. Enderton a good start, and then follow him down the {{mountain}} to the station. But a little reflection showed me that this plan would not answer. Ruth was {{not strong enough to}} walk so far, and although Mrs. Aleshine had plenty of vigor, she was too plump to attempt such a tramp. Besides, the sky was so heavily overcast that it was not safe to leave the shelter of the coach.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said his}} father, with an {{amusement}} {{which was not}} unfriendly. He added, after <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that had been broken off," [...] and Dan's instinct penetrated to the lurking fact that his father must have talked the rupture over with his mother, and not wholly regretted it.|$|R
