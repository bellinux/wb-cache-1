5|$|Finally in 1859, Marx {{published}} <b>A</b> <b>Contribution</b> to the Critique of Political Economy, {{his first}} serious economic work. This work was intended {{merely as a}} preview of his three-volume Das Kapital (English title: Capital: Critique of Political Economy), which he intended to publish at a later date. In <b>A</b> <b>Contribution</b> to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx accepts the labour theory of value as advocated by David Ricardo, but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between use value and value in commodities, Ricardo always {{had been unable to}} define the real relationship between use value and value. The reasoning Marx laid out in his book clearly delineated the true relationship between use value and value. He also produced a truly scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capitalist economy, thus <b>A</b> <b>Contribution</b> to the Critique of Political Economy created a storm of enthusiasm when it appeared in public and the entire edition of the book was sold out quickly.|$|E
5|$|Foucault's {{analysis}} of Las Meninas, although {{on one level}} <b>a</b> <b>contribution</b> to art history, is more about epistemology, specifically the 'cognitive status of the modern human sciences', based on the possibility, suggested by Ludwig Wittgenstein, that a picture {{is a model of}} reality.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} Marcinkus's {{letters to}} the Lithuanian envoy, Bronius Balutis, he notes that he shot down his first German bomber, a Dornier Do 17 in March.

There is also a risk that climate change, weak economic growth and social factors could cause instability in South Pacific countries.|$|E
5|$|Dakshina Kannada {{district}} has {{a per capita}} income of Rs.2,18,580 which {{is second only to}} Bengaluru Urban district. Despite ranking 8th in the list of most populous districts in Karnataka, the district is the second largest contributor to the state's GSDP, with <b>a</b> <b>contribution</b> of 5.8%.

5|$|Leonardo was, and is, renowned {{primarily}} as a painter. Among his works, the Mona Lisa is the most famous and most parodied portrait and The Last Supper the most reproduced religious painting of all time. Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items {{as varied as the}} euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen of his paintings have survived. Nevertheless, these few works, together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, compose <b>a</b> <b>contribution</b> to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, Michelangelo.|$|E
5|$|The EC, {{is located}} in the parahippocampal gyrus, a {{cortical}} region adjacent to the hippocampus. This gyrus conceals the hippocampus. The parahippocampal gyrus also includes the perirhinal cortex which {{plays an important role in}} the visual recognition of complex objects. There is also substantial evidence that it makes <b>a</b> <b>contribution</b> to memory, which can be distinguished from the contribution of the hippocampus. It is apparent that complete amnesia occurs only when both the hippocampus and the parahippocampus are damaged.|$|E
5|$|In January 1917, Crawford {{successfully}} {{applied to}} join the RFC as an observer with the 23rd Squadron, which flew over enemy lines to make observations and draw maps. On his maiden flight, the German Army opened fire on his aircraft, and his right foot was pierced by bullets and badly injured. To recuperate, he spent time at various hospitals in France and England before {{being sent to the}} RFC Auxiliary Hospital at the Heligan estate in Cornwall. During this time in England he spent a weekend at Wells's home in Dunmow, Essex, embracing the latter's desire for a united world government and the idea that writing about global history was <b>a</b> <b>contribution</b> to that cause. While at Heligan, Crawford began work on a book, Man and his Past, in which he examined a broad sweep of human history from an archaeological and geographical perspective.|$|E

5|$|Labradors like to eat, {{and without}} proper {{exercise}} can become obese. Laziness is <b>a</b> <b>contribution</b> to this. Obesity {{is a serious}} condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight. Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, {{and can lead to}} secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.|$|E
5|$|Life with PlayStation was a Folding@home {{application}} {{available for}} PlayStation 3 which connected to Stanford University’s Folding@home distributed computer network {{and allowed the}} user to donate their console's spare processing cycles to the project. Folding@home is supported by Stanford University and volunteers make <b>a</b> <b>contribution</b> to society by donating computing power to this project. Research made by the project may eventually contribute {{to the creation of}} vital cures. The Folding@home client was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment in collaboration with Stanford University. Life with PlayStation also consisted of a 3D virtual view of the Earth and contained current weather and news information of various cities and countries from around the world, as well as a World Heritage channel which offered information about historical sites, and the United Village channel which is a project designed to share information about communities and cultures worldwide. As of PlayStation 3 system software update version 4.30 on October 24, 2012, the Life With PlayStation project has ended.|$|E
5|$|O.albiventer {{is part of}} {{the genus}} Oryzomys, which {{currently}} includes about eight species distributed from the eastern United States (O.palustris) into northwestern South America (O.gorgasi). O.albiventer is further part of the O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the systematics of the O.couesi section remain unclear and {{it is likely that the}} current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group. Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were progressively removed in various studies culminating in <b>a</b> <b>contribution</b> by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than forty species from the genus. All are classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
