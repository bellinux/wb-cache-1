5|$|Training started {{immediately}} {{and concentrated on}} physical fitness, weapons training, movement across country including cliff climbing, obstacle crossing and raiding operations. Weapons training was limited {{by the lack of}} <b>anything</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> personal weapons (rifles and pistols) that each man had brought with him. Machine guns or anything heavier were not available at the time. In August 1940, some officers and non-commissioned officers (NCO) were sent to Achnacarry in the Scottish Highlands on a commando course. These men were then responsible for teaching the rest of the unit.|$|E
5|$|Delivered to the Navy on January 30, 1937, the {{aircraft}} was officially {{presented to the}} public at Hall's Bristol, Pennsylvania factory in April of that year. The aircraft's early flight testing, starting in February and conducted by test pilot Bill McAvoy, showed that the XPTBH had few faults, with the only significant issue being a lack of roll authority – a reduction of the ability of the ailerons to turn {{the aircraft}} – {{as a result of the}} surface area of the floats. A modification to increase the area of the rudder solved the issue. The aircraft's water-handling characteristics were found to be excellent; the only significant complaints that surfaced during the testing period concerned the XPTBH-2's beaching gear, which was found to be extremely difficult to use in <b>anything</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> calmest water.|$|E

50|$|During this phase, commerce, industry, and {{agriculture}} received increasing attention. Attention was also {{given to the}} creation of wealth in order to strengthen the country. This was a new idea for the Chinese, who had always been uncomfortable with activities which create wealth from <b>anything</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> land. <b>The</b> development of profit-oriented industries such as shipping, railways, mining, and telegraphy were therefore rather new ventures for the Chinese government.|$|R

The organization sees evolution as incompatible with scripture and believes <b>anything</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> young earth view is a compromise on biblical inerrancy.|$|E

25|$|Rüstow and Köchly, {{writing in}} the 19th century, {{believed}} that Pelopidas led the Sacred Band out from the column to attack the Spartans in the flank.

Plutarch does indeed describe Pelopidas leading the Band and catching the Spartans in disorder, but there is nothing in his account that conveys <b>anything</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Sacred Band being the head of the column, and the Spartans were disordered not because they were taken in the flank but because they were caught in mid-maneuver, extending their line.|$|E
25|$|Such was {{the extent}} and {{efficacy}} of his preparation of the script that almost no line of dialogue was eliminated in the final edit of the film. Except for some exterior night shots, Huston shot the entire film in sequence, which greatly helped his actors. The shooting went so smoothly that there was actually extra time for the cast to enjoy themselves; Huston brought Bogart, Astor, Bond, Lorre and others to the Lakeside Golf Club near the Warner lot to relax in the pool, dine, drink and talk until midnight about <b>anything</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> film they were working on.|$|E

5|$|By World War I, all of {{the major}} powers were experimenting with {{aircraft}} mounted cannon; however their low rate of fire and great size and weight precluded any of them from being <b>anything</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> experimental. <b>The</b> most successful (or least unsuccessful) was the SPAD 12 Ca.1 with a single 37mm Puteaux mounted to fire between the cylinder banks and through the propeller boss of the aircraft's Hispano-Suiza 8C. The pilot (by necessity an ace) had to manually reload each round.|$|R
25|$|As {{that year}} began, Another World was {{expanded}} to 60 minutes, {{with their first}} hour-long episode airing on January 6, 1975. Although this did not directly affect As the World Turns, as the two shows were not in competition for <b>anything</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> overall ratings win, CBS' afternoon lineup suffered some ratings damage as the popular soap put {{a dent in the}} ratings of both of CBS' popular afternoon game shows, The Price Is Right and Match Game. NBC, pleased by the success that the expansion of Another World had brought to the network, elected {{to do the same thing}} with Days of Our Lives beginning on April 21, 1975; this put Days of Our Lives and As the World Turns in direct competition for ratings. Incidentally, the expansions were occurring seven years after the last two 15-minute serials, Search for Tomorrow and The Guiding Light, expanded to 30 minutes.|$|E

50|$|Bulgaria's {{entry into}} World War I {{on the side}} of the Central Powers {{signified}} a dramatic shift in the way European public opinion viewed the Slavic population of Macedonia.

"The {{method of}} killing {{homotopy}} groups", due to [...] involves repeatedly using the Hurewicz theorem {{to compute the}} first non-trivial homotopy group and then killing (eliminating) it with a fibration involving an Eilenberg-MacLane space.

500|$|When the Abbey Theatre {{was set up}} Synge was {{appointed}} literary adviser and soon {{became one of the}} directors, along with Yeats and Lady Gregory.

500|$|Historians {{have often}} {{suggested}} that Guy Fawkes Day {{served as a}} Protestant replacement for the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain or Calan Gaeaf, pagan events that the church absorbed and transformed into All Hallow's Eve and All Souls' Day. In The Golden Bough, the Scottish anthropologist James George Frazer suggested that Guy Fawkes Day exemplifies [...] "the recrudescence of old customs in modern shapes". [...] David Underdown, writing in his 1987 work Revel, Riot, and Rebellion, viewed Gunpowder Treason Day {{as a replacement for}} Hallowe'en: [...] "just as the early church had taken over many of the pagan feasts, so did Protestants acquire their own rituals, adapting older forms or providing substitutes for them". While the use of bonfires to mark the occasion was most likely taken from the ancient practice of lighting celebratory bonfires, the idea that the commemoration of 5November 1605 ever originated from <b>anything</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> safety of James I is, according to David Cressy, [...] "speculative nonsense". [...] Citing Cressy's work, Ronald Hutton agrees with his conclusion, writing, [...] "There is, in brief, nothing to link the Hallowe'en fires of North Wales, Man, and central Scotland with those which appeared in England upon 5November." [...] Further confusion arises in Northern Ireland, where some communities celebrate Guy Fawkes Night; the distinction there between the Fifth, and Halloween, is not always clear.
