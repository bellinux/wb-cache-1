5000|$|... 401 {{is one of}} 25 class H-4 2-8-0 Consolidation Type steam {{locomotives}} {{built by}} the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in November 1907 for the Southern Railroad to haul freight trains. In 1949, #401 was sold to the Alabama <b>Asphaltic</b> <b>Limestone</b> Company in Margerum, Alabama. She switched hopper cars of stone until the company brought in a diesel in 1963, then she was placed on stand-by service in case the diesel broke down. Sometimes, she would be fired up to take the employees on company picnics. In 1965, #401 was officially retired from service. The locomotive was purchased by a museum in 1967 from Alabama <b>Asphaltic</b> <b>Limestone.</b> In January 1968, the locomotive was shipped to Decatur, Illinois for storage until October 1971, it was finally moved to the Monticello Railway Museum in Monticello, Illinois for display. In 1995, the museum made plans to restore 401 to operating condition again in which it did in 2010.|$|E
