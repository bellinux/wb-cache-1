[...] In 2014, a papyrus discovered by Simon Burris, Jeffrey Fish, and Dirk Obbink – P. GC. inv. 105 – added <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>words</b> <b>to</b> the known {{text of the}} poem. [...] This papyrus dates to the late-second or early-third century, {{and is in the}} same hand as a second papyrus published {{for the first time in}} 2014 (P. Sapph. Obbink), which preserves five stanzas of Sappho's Brothers Poem.|$|E

500|$|... "Tik Tok" [...] {{was written}} by Kesha, {{alongside}} Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco and was co-produced by Luke and Blanco. Kesha said the inspiration behind the song came from coming home half-drunk and stumbling after a night out of partying. She would then write down <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>words</b> <b>to</b> a song, then the following morning she would wake up with the story waiting to be told. The opening line came from an experience where she woke up surrounded by [...] "beautiful women", leading to her imagining P. Diddy being in a similar scenario. She then proceeded to bring the song to her producer Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco and the song was written. Four hours later, Diddy called Luke {{and said that they}} should do a song together. Diddy came to the studio later that day to contribute his lines and the collaboration was completed.|$|E
500|$|Before his execution, Turpin {{frequently}} received visitors (the gaoler was {{reputed to}} have earned £100 from selling drinks to Turpin and his guests), although he refused {{the efforts of}} a local clergyman who offered him [...] "serious remonstrances and admonitions". [...] John Turpin may have sent his son a letter, dated 29March, urging him to [...] "beg of God to pardon your many transgressions, which the thief upon the cross received pardon for at the last hour". [...] Turpin bought a new frock coat and shoes, and {{on the day before}} his execution hired five mourners for three pounds and ten shillings (to be shared between them). [...] On 7April 1739, followed by his mourners, Turpin and John Stead (a horse thief) were taken through York by open cart to Knavesmire, which was then the city's equivalent of London's Tyburn gallows. [...] Turpin [...] "behav'd himself with amazing assurance", and [...] "bow'd to the spectators as he passed". [...] He climbed a ladder to the gallows and spoke to his executioner. [...] York had no permanent hangman, and it was the custom to pardon a prisoner on condition that he acted as executioner. [...] On this occasion, the pardoned man was a fellow highwayman, Thomas Hadfield. [...] An account in The Gentleman's Magazine for 7April 1739 notes Turpin's brashness: [...] "Turpin behaved in an undaunted manner; as he mounted the ladder, feeling his right leg tremble, he spoke <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>words</b> <b>to</b> the topsman, then threw himself off, and expir'd in five minutes." ...|$|E
