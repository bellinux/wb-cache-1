5|$|The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) which {{split from}} the Dravidar Kazhagam in 1949, {{inherited}} the anti-Hindi policies of its parent organisation. DMK's founder Annadurai had earlier {{participated in the}} anti-Hindi imposition agitations during 1938–40 and in the 1940s. In July 1953, the DMK launched an agitation for changing {{the name of a}} town – Dalmiapuram – to Kallakudi. They claimed that the town's name (after Ramkrishna Dalmia) symbolised the exploitation of South India by the North. On 15 July 1953, M. Karunanidhi (later Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu) and other DMK members erased the Hindi name in Dalmiapuram railway station's name board <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the tracks. In the altercation with the Police that followed the protests, two DMK members lost their lives and several others including Karunanidhi and Kannadhasan were arrested.|$|E
25|$|The brawl {{began when}} Artest fouled Pistons center Ben Wallace as Wallace was {{putting up a}} shot. Wallace, upset at being fouled hard when the game was {{effectively}} over (the Pacers led 97–82 with less than 50 seconds to go), responded by shoving Artest, leading to an altercation near the scorer's table. Artest walked to the sideline <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the scorer's table. Reacting to Wallace throwing something at Artest, Pistons fan John Green threw a cup of Diet Coke at Artest, hitting him. Artest jumped into the front-row seats and confronted a man he incorrectly believed to be responsible, which in turn erupted into a brawl between Pistons fans {{and several of the}} Pacers. Artest returned to the basketball court, and punched Pistons fan A.J. Shackleford, who was apparently taunting Artest verbally. This fight resulted in the game being stopped with less than a minute remaining. Artest's teammates Jermaine O'Neal and Stephen Jackson were suspended indefinitely the day after the game, along with Wallace.|$|E
500|$|In the Confessions Tour, {{the song}} was the second {{performance}} of the evening and {{was part of the}} equine segment of the show. Madonna wore a skin-tight, full body black leotard. She opened her hat from the previous performance of [...] "Future Lovers", as the background changed from the video of the horses to a red, geometric patterned kaleidoscope shot by Steven Klein. Madonna started singing the song. Two male backup dancers appeared behind her wearing horse reins around their heads to convey the feeling of oppression. The song continued in their choreographed performance, with Madonna sometimes pulling the harness around her dancers as if they were horses. During the intermediate musical interlude, Madonna moved {{to the front of the}} stage <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the screen attached to it. As she continued singing the music increased and she started to twirl in the center of the stage. The performance continued with Madonna and her dancers moving to the back of the stage singing the words [...] "get together" [...] repeatedly. It ended with the music of the next song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] starting.|$|E

60|$|And so {{the captain}} <b>and</b> mate <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the house together, and Keola {{was left to}} himself.|$|R
60|$|They {{are like}} two navigators of whom the first sees a new country, but takes clouds for {{mountains}} and mirage for lowlands; {{while the second}} determines its length <b>and</b> breadth, <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a chart its exact place, so that, thenceforth, {{it serves as a}} guide to his successors, and becomes a secure outpost whence new explorations may be pushed.|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked at}} me with a lazy indulgent smile, <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> his back on the bank, saying: [...] "It's all right for a doss—here." ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{friends were}} sorry, but {{could do nothing}} to help her; so Dorothy went to her own room <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the bed and cried herself to sleep.|$|E
60|$|The man, who was {{obviously}} worn out, gathered some spruce twigs <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> them, {{but the others}} sat a while beside the fire before they followed his example.|$|E
60|$|The black shawl {{having been}} procured, Anne spread {{it over the}} flat <b>and</b> then <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the bottom, with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast.|$|R
6000|$|... "We will go {{to sleep}} now," [...] they said, [...] "and when we wake up the kettle will be boiled"; <b>and</b> they <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the grass, <b>and</b> shut their eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fire rises out of {{the lunar}} mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her up to a peak, <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> her <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{the edge of a}} crater." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{left the}} window <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> her bed. Sleep, {{that had come}} treacherously before, came mercifully now; came deep and dreamless, {{the image of her}} last waking thought--the image of Death.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, I can undress in the dark. I'm used to it." [...] She {{loosened}} {{the collar}} of her dress, slipped off her shoes, <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the bed bitter and rebellious.|$|E
60|$|The wayfarer smoked {{his pipe}} out, {{put it in}} his breast, slipped off his great wooden shoes, <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> his back on the heap of stones. He was fast asleep directly.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Harry then takes:--1, {{his fine}} new gold watch; 2, his {{repeater}} (that {{which he had}} bought for Hetty), which he puts into his other fob; 3, his necklace, which he had purchased for Theo; 4, his rings, of which my gentleman must have half a dozen at least (with the exception of his grandfather's old seal ring, which he kisses <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the pincushion again); 5, his three gold snuff boxes: and 6, his purse, knitted by his mother, and containing three shillings and sixpence and a pocket-piece brought from Virginia: and, putting on his hat, issues from his door.|$|R

The sea-contestants are Arnoud, Wilmie, Deborah and Foke. They have {{to take pictures of}} whales they spot while they're on a boat. They have to take a picture of a whale's head, a tail and 4 whales together. Each one of them can take 4 pictures. Wilmie gets seasick <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the deck. In the end, they couldn't find 4 whales together. They have a huge discussion during dinner, which leads to Petra walking away.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>laying</b> <b>down</b> Matcham <b>on</b> the turf, he {{undid the}} hood from off his face, and {{disclosed}} {{the features of}} Sir Daniel Brackley.|$|R
60|$|So he {{did what}} the Princess had told him. He walked {{straight}} in between the lions just {{as if he did}} not see them, and then into the small chamber, <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the bed.|$|E
60|$|The sunset was {{reddening}} {{the tops}} of the cocoanut palms when Billy Keogh came back from Casa Morena. He nodded to the artist's questioning gaze; <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a cot with his hands under the back of his head.|$|E
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head, {{and took off}} her shabby bonnet; her pretty light-brown hair fell about her face and her shoulders. [...] "I think I'm too tired, sir, to be hungry. Might I take the sofa-pillow, <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the hearth-rug?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mary {{then went}} {{over with the}} woman; <b>and</b> John <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> some mats, to sleep, {{until it was time}} to start. He slept soundly, until he was aroused by the entry of someone, with lights. He started to his feet, and found that it was Josephus, himself, with an attendant.|$|R
60|$|When {{this was}} over Mrs. Carey {{went to her}} room to rest, <b>and</b> Mr. Carey <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the sofa in the drawing-room for forty winks.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, when it grew {{dark and}} we {{returned}} to the house, I noticed that Dan was rather pale <b>and</b> quiet. He <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the kitchen sofa.|$|R

60|$|He and Harvey {{went out}} on the trolley to East Gloucester, where they tramped through the bayberry-bushes to the lighthouse, <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the big red {{boulders}} and laughed themselves hungry.

60|$|They {{went to a}} small inn, had supper, <b>and</b> then <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> some straw in an {{outhouse}} {{and slept}} soundly until morning.

60|$|As Jeanne {{finished}} speaking {{she placed}} her finger on her lips, for she thought she heard a slight noise without.

The next instant the door opened noiselessly and Sister Felicia entered. She moved with a noiseless step up to Jeanne.|$|R
6000|$|... “This {{will never}} do,” the mate said. “We can’t use our {{strength}} to advantage, else the weight {{would not be}} too great for us.

In that way I don’t think we shall have much difficulty about it.” ...|$|R
60|$|Well, {{we put up}} at {{a modest}} little inn near the harbor. I was dead tired with the journey, <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> my bed to get some rest. Mr. Dark, whom nothing ever fatigued, left me to take his toddy and pipe among the company in the taproom.|$|E
60|$|Wulf {{was then}} {{conducted}} by the host to a small chamber upstairs, where there was the luxury of a bed stuffed with straw.

60|$|The {{flag was}} still {{continuing}} its {{up and down}} movement; the boy approached <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the snow close to it; then he {{took hold of the}} stick; he felt a pull, but held fast; then he put his mouth close to the hole, two or three inches in diameter, through which it passed.|$|E

60|$|On {{reaching}} the fire-station they leaped to the ground, and all went quickly and silently to their neighbouring homes and beds, except {{the two men}} on duty.
