40|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>options,</b> {{also known}} as average value options, are exotic options whose payoffs are {{dependent}} on the average prices of the underlying assets {{over the life of}} the <b>options.</b> The <b>Asian</b> <b>options</b> are very popular among the market participants when dealing with thinly traded commodities because the average property of the <b>Asian</b> <b>options</b> makes it very difficult to manipulate the payoffs of the options. Another reason for the popularity of <b>Asian</b> <b>options</b> is that they are cheaper than the corresponding portfolio of standard options to hedge the same exposure. The pricing of <b>Asian</b> <b>options</b> has been the subject of continuous studies. In previous studies, <b>Asian</b> <b>options</b> have been priced based on the assumption that the underlying asset follows a geometric Brownian motion. This dissertation, however, assumes that the underlying asset follows a geometric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and provides an explicit formula for the geometric <b>Asian</b> <b>options.</b> The geometric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is more economically appropriate than the geometric Brownian motion for modelling commodity prices, exchange rates and interest rates due to its mean-reverting property...|$|R
40|$|Conditional <b>Asian</b> <b>options</b> are recent market innovations, {{which offer}} cheaper and long-dated {{alternatives}} to regular <b>Asian</b> <b>options.</b> In contrast with payoffs from regular <b>Asian</b> <b>options</b> {{which are based}} on average asset prices, the payoffs from conditional <b>Asian</b> <b>options</b> are determined only by average prices above certain threshold. Due to the limited inclusion of prices, conditional <b>Asian</b> <b>options</b> further reduce the volatility in the payoffs than their regular counterparts and have been promoted in the market as viable hedging and risk management instruments for equity-linked life insurance products. There has been no previous academic literature on this subject and practitioners have only been known to price these products by simulations. We propose the first analytical approach to computing prices and deltas of conditional <b>Asian</b> <b>options</b> in comparison with regular <b>Asian</b> <b>options.</b> In the numerical examples, we put to the test some cost-benefit claims by practitioners. As a by-product, the work also presents some distributional properties of the occupation time and the time-integral of geometric Brownian motion during the occupation time...|$|R

40|$|This is a {{collection}} of functions to valuate <b>Asian</b> <b>options.</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>options</b> are path-dependent options, with payoffs that depend on the average price of the underlying asset or the average exercise price. There are two categories or types of Asian options: average rate options (also known as average price options) and average strike options.

For Asian options the payoff is {{determined}} by the average underlying price over some pre-set period of time. This is different from the case of the usual European option and American option, where the payoff of the option contract depends on the price of the underlying instrument at exercise; Asian options are thus one of the basic forms of exotic options.There are two types of Asian Fixed Strike option, the Asian Fixed Strike call and the Asian Fixed Strike put.

40|$|Determining {{the correct}} {{value of an}} option is the main problem in option theory. There are several factors which {{determine}} the price of an option. In addition to these factors, Asian options also depend {{on the history of}} the underlying asset which complicates the correct pricing of an <b>Asian</b> <b>option.</b> Although the structure of an <b>Asian</b> <b>option</b> is more complex than for example European option's, many of the typical numerical methods can still be used to nd the price of an <b>Asian</b> <b>option</b> when modi ed correctly. In the rst part of this thesis some of these typical numerical methods are introduced. The basic idea of lattice method, di erential method and Monte-Carlo method are described by showing how to nd a value of a usual European option step by step. The last and main part of this thesis is dedicated to Asian options and lattice method. It is shown how to modify the lattice method so that it could be used for pricing an <b>Asian</b> <b>option.</b> The modi ed lattice method for pricing an <b>Asian</b> <b>option</b> is called forward shooting grid method (FSG) and was rst used in 1993 by Hull and White for nding the value of Asian and lookback options. The method is described thoroughly and 2 di erent approaches (Barraquand-Pudet method and modi ed Hull-White method) for choosing the average price of an underlying asset are introduced. To ensure that the FSG method can truly be used for pricing an <b>Asian</b> <b>option,</b> some results obtained by using the FSG method with di erent parameters N, and are brought out in the last section of the thesis.

Because of this, <b>Asian</b> <b>options</b> have a lower volatility and this render them cheaper relative to their European counterparts. <b>Asian</b> <b>options</b> belong to the so-called path-dependent derivatives; they are among the most difficult to price and hedge both analytically and numerically. In practice, it is only discrete <b>Asian</b> <b>options</b> that are traded, however continuous <b>Asian</b> <b>options</b> are used for studying purposes. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature, including Monte Carlo simulations, tree-based methods, Taylor’s expansion, partial differential equations, and analytical ap- proximations among others. When using partial differential equations for pricing of continuous time <b>Asian</b> <b>options,</b> the high dimensionality is problematic. In this dissertation we focus on the discrete time methods. We start off by explaining the binomial tree method, and our last chapter presents the very exciting and relatively simple method of Tsao and Huang, using Taylor approximations. The main papers that are used in this dissertation are articles by Jan Vecer (2001); LCG Rogers (1995); Eric Benhamou (2001); Gianluca Fusai (2007); Kamizono, Kariya and Nakatsuma (2006) and Tsao and Huang (2007).
