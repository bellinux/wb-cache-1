Empire wrote that [...] "Walt Disney meets Quincy Jones" [...] on [...] "Pusher Love Girl" [...] and that the song rivals English space rock band Spiritualized for [...] "dovetailing affection with addiction". Metros Arwa Haider declared that the song initially recalls Barry White and The Love Unlimited Orchestra, only with [...] "the walrus of lurve's bass croon" [...] replaced by Timberlake's [...] "falsetto yelp".|$|E

500|$|D'Angelo's singing {{throughout}} Brown Sugar is a gospel-influenced, falsetto crooning style, which {{critics have}} compared {{the singing of}} Prince, <b>Al</b> <b>Green,</b> Donny Hathaway, and Sam Cooke. Despite the album's retro influence, music writers have noted his delivery as having a hip hop approach and [...] "", as one critic described the album as a [...] "blend of classic soul and urban attitude". Another writer described the album's vibe as [...] "sultry" [...] and D'Angelo's vocal delivery as [...] "sly". Music journalist Jon Caramanica later called D'Angelo a [...] "classicist, in other words, cloaked {{in the guise of}} a hip-hop roughneck." [...] Shapiro viewed the vocal production as similar to that of Prince's Sign o' the Times (1987). The album's closing track [...] "Higher" [...] features D'Angelo's organ set to a choir of his overdubbed vocals, while [...] "Jonz in My Bonz", which compares love to an addiction, features D'Angelo's falsetto moans overdubbed in an array for effect.|$|E

The album was released and distributed in 1992 by Liaison Records, the label that also released Brown's Go-go albums. Brown originally intended to record an additional duet with Cassidy for his next solo album, but this was postponed due to ongoing negotiations between Dale and other labels for a solo deal. Cassidy's unwillingness to narrow her stylistic focus to one genre hindered her chances of securing a deal. After talks broke down, the two decided to record their own duet album.

Since elemental diffusion has a significantly smaller effect than the representative velocity of advective transport (e.g., Iwamori 1998), {{it has been}} neglected here.
