40|$|The role of net {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) <b>alkali</b> <b>absorption</b> in {{the development}} of hypocitraturia was investigated. The net GI absorption of alkali was estimated from the difference between simple urinary cations (Ca, Mg, Na, and K) and anions (Cl and P). In 131 normal subjects, the 24 h urinary citrate was positively correlated with the net GI absorption of alkali (r = 0. 49, p < 0. 001). In 11 patients with distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA), urinary citrate excretion was subnormal relative to net GI <b>alkali</b> <b>absorption,</b> with data from most patients residing outside the 95 % confidence ellipse described for normal subjects. However, the normal relationship between urinary citrate and net absorbed alkali was maintained in 11 patients with chronic diarrheal syndrome (CDS) and in 124 stone-forming patients devoid of RTA or CDS, half of whom had "idiopathic" hypocitraturia. The 18 stone-forming patients without RTA or CDS received potassium citrate (30 - 60 mEq/day). Both urinary citrate and net GI <b>alkali</b> <b>absorption</b> increased, yielding a significantly positive correlation (r = 0. 62, p < 0. 0001), with the slope indistinguishable from that of normal subjects. Thus, urinary citrate was normally dependent on the net GI absorption of alkali. This dependence was less marked in RTA, confirming the renal origin of hypocitraturia. However, the normal dependence was maintained in CDS and in idiopathic hypocitraturia, suggesting that reduced citrate excretion was largely dietary in origin as a result of low net <b>alkali</b> <b>absorption</b> (from a probable relative deficiency of vegetables and fruits or a relative excess of animal proteins) ...|$|E

40|$|Acid-base {{balance in}} chronic peritoneal {{dialysis}} patients. Endogenous acid production {{has never been}} measured directly in dialysis patients and an empiric formula is used to estimate acid production from their protein catabolic rate. We have studied acid-base balance in 19 stable CAPD patients attending the peritoneal dialysis clinic of Mount Sinai Hospital. They obtained a 24 hour collection of peritoneal dialysis fluid and urine while consuming their usual diet and performing their usual activities. Total alkali gain was calculated from net GI <b>alkali</b> <b>absorption</b> plus urinary net acid excretion plus alkali gain from dialysate, while total acid production was measured directly from the urinary and dialysate excretions of sulfate and organic anions. Net GI <b>alkali</b> <b>absorption</b> was estimated from the difference between cations (Na + K + Ca + Mg) and anions (Cl + 1. 8 P) in the 24 hour dialysate and urine collections minus the daily total amount of lactate infused. All of our patients had a normal or high serum bicarbonate concentration, which was stable with time. Total alkali gain was virtually identical to total acid production (54. 2 vs. 52. 4 mEq/day) which suggests that these patients were in neutral acid-base balance. Net GI <b>alkali</b> <b>absorption</b> (22. 7 mEq/day) {{was one of the}} same range as that of chronic renal failure patients not on dialysis and represented almost one half of the total daily alkali gain. The daily acid production of 52. 4 mEq/day was numerically equal to 84 % of the protein catabolic rate expressed as g/day, which is similar to the predicted value of 77 % of PCR reported in the literature. However, the main source of alkali loss, that is, acid production, was the loss of organic anions in dialysate and urine. Daily sulfate excretion (16 mEq/day) was lower than expected for the level of protein intake (protein catabolic rate of 62 g/day). The stable serum bicarbonate concentrations on long-term dialysis suggests a steady state and neutral acid-base balance in these patients. The almost perfect agreement between acid production and total alkali gain supports the validity of our methods for measuring the various parameters of acid-base balance, including net GI absorption of alkali...|$|E

40|$|Citrate is an {{inhibitor}} of the crystallization of stone-forming calcium salts. Hypocitraturia, frequently {{encountered in}} patients with nephrolithiasis, is therefore an important risk factor for stone formation. Potassium citrate provides physiological and physicochemical correction and inhibits new stone formation, not only in hypocitraturic calcium nephrolithiasis but also in uric acid nephrolithiasis. Inhibition of stone recurrence has now been validated by a randomized trial. Ongoing research has disclosed additional causes of hypocitraturia (sodium excess, low intestinal <b>alkali</b> <b>absorption,</b> but not primary citrate malabsorption). Moreover, new insights on potassium citrate action have been shown, notably that some of absorbed citrate escapes oxidation and contributes to the citraturic response, that ingestion with a meal does not sacrifice physiological or physicochemical action, that orange juice mimics but does not completely duplicate its actions, that potassium citrate may have a beneficial bone-sparing effect, that it may reduce stone fragments following ESWL, and that danger of aluminum toxicity is not great in subjects with functioning kidneys.

Analyses of the C budget were carried out with field measurement based on dark enclosed chamber techniques and <b>alkali</b> <b>absorption</b> methods, {{and the application of}} the CENTURY model. Results indicated that: (1) soil CO 2 flux had a strong diurnal and seasonal variation influenced by grassland type and land-use practices.

Understanding the relationship between emission rate and the factors associated with the emission process is important in global carbon emission management.

The emission rate was also greater in grassland than the plantation area. Rate of carbon emission from soil was heterogeneous along different depths below the ground. Diel variation in emission rate was greater at HZ compared to RZ. Higher microbial population in soil was detected in RZ than HZ.

In this study, the pozzolanic behavior of sugarcane bagasse ash (SBA) {{and its role}} in controlling alkali silica reaction (ASR) was investigated. For this purpose, SBA was acquired from a sugar processing industry. Locally available reactive aggregates were used to introduce the phenomenon of ASR. To evaluate the role of SBA in mitigating ASR, mortar bar specimens were prepared following ASTM C 1260 with various SBA dosages (10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 % by cement weight). To investigate the pozzolanic behavior of SBA strength activity index test and thermal analysis were performed. Results of activity index and thermal analysis showed the pozzolanic behavior of SBA. Moreover, reduction in mortar bar expansion was observed 23 % and 46 % after replacing 10 % and 40 % cement with SBA, respectively. Microscopic examination also showed no signs of cracks in mortar bars incorporating SBA; however minor cracking was observed in control specimens due to ASR. Furthermore, Energy disperse X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed low Ca/SiO 2 ratio of mortar bars incorporating SBA due to dilution process and <b>alkali</b> <b>absorption</b> leading to control the ASR expansion.

Three CO 2 absorption areas were evaluated (7; 15 and 20 % of the soil emission area or chamber); two volumes of NaOH (40 and 80 mL) at three concentrations (0. 1, 0. 25 and 0. 5 mol L- 1).

30|$|Infrared {{spectra of}} {{crystalline}} <b>alkali</b> hydroxide show <b>absorption</b> bands in the 4000 – 4400  cm− 1 portion of IR spectra. It {{has been proposed}} that they arise from {{the combination of the}} O-H fundamental stretching vibrations with the lattice modes (Buchanan 1959; Wickersheim 1959; Snyder et al. 1960). Therefore, contribution from MOH species in the 4100 – 4500  cm− 1 range of the IR spectra of the present glasses seems possible, so that the observed unknown OH could be MOH species. In this line of thinking, we note that the IR peak near 4500 – 4600  cm− 1 is also observed in hydrous soda-lime-borate glasses and assigned to the combination of the OH stretching with lattice vibrational modes (Bauer et al. 2015). Therefore, the 4500  cm− 1 IR peak in hydrous glasses not only contains contributions of OH groups bonded to Si, as it has been previously inferred (e.g., Malfait 2009 and references therein), but also possible contributions from other OH species bonded to metallic elements or even boron, as shown by the data of Bauer et al.

Significant flux is detected down to the spectrum's short wavelength limit of 6200 Å. The spectrum exhibits a broad absorption feature centered at 7700 Å, which we interpret as the K I 7665 / 7699 resonance doublet. The observed flux declines shortward of 7000 Å, due most likely to the red wing of the Na I doublet. Both Cs I doublet lines are detected more strongly than in an earlier red spectrum. Neither Li I absorption nor Hα emission are detected. An exploratory model fit to the spectrum suggests that {{the shape of the}} red spectrum can be primarily accounted for by the broad wings of the K I and Na I doublets. This behavior is consistent with the argument proffered by Burrows, Marley and Sharp that strong <b>alkali</b> <b>absorption</b> is principally responsible for depressing T dwarf spectra shortward of 1 μm. In particular, there seems no compelling reason at this time to introduce dust or an additional opacity source in the atmosphere of the SDSS object.

This process, <b>Alkali</b> <b>absorption</b> with Regeneration (AwR), consists in {{a first step in}} which CO 2 is separated from the biogas by chemical absorption with an alkali aqueous solution followed by a second step in which the spent absorption solution is regenerated for reuse in the first step and the captured CO 2 is stored in a solid and thermodynamically stable form. The latter process is carried out contacting the spent absorption solution, rich in carbonate and bicarbonate ions, with a waste material characterized by a high content of calcium hydroxide and leads to the precipitation of calcium carbonate and to the regeneration of the alkali hydroxide content of the solution.

We find that due to qualitative similarities in the compositions and spectra of objects within each of five broad effective temperature ranges, it is natural to establish five representative EGP albedo classes: a "Jovian" class (T_ eff≲ 150 K; Class I) with tropospheric ammonia clouds, a "water cloud" class (T_ eff∼ 250 K; Class II) primarily affected by condensed H_ 2 O, a "clear" class (T_ eff≳ 350 K; Class III) which lacks clouds, and two high-temperature classes: Class IV (900 K ≲ T_eff ≲ 1500 K) for which <b>alkali</b> metal <b>absorption</b> predominates, and Class V (T_eff ≳ 1500 K and/or low surface gravity (≲ 10 ^ 3 cm s^- 2)) for which a high silicate layer shields a significant fraction of the incident radiation from alkali metal and molecular absorption.

UCit×V positively correlated with urine volume (VOLUME, r= 0. 44, P= 0. 009), vegetable fibre intake (fibers, r= 0. 46, P= 0. 009) and GI-alkali <b>absorption</b> (<b>alkali,</b> r= 0. 47, P= 0. 006), and volume, fibres and alkali tended to be lower among RCSF with low-/hypo-cit. A 3 -day NH 4 Cl loading test (0. 95 mEq/kg BW daily in 3 doses) was performed in RCSF {{as well as in}} 14 age-matched healthy male controls (C). On a plot of urine pH versus serum bicarbonate, 10 of 11 RCSF with low-/hypo-cit, but only six of 23 with normo-cit (P= 0. 0004) fell off the normal range, indicating incomplete RTA. Two or more risk factors simultaneously occurred in only four of 23 RCSF with normo-cit, but in eight of 11 with low-/hypo-cit (P= 0. 002). In conclusion, incomplete RTA is the most prevalent risk factor for low-/hypo-cit in RCSF, and decreases in vegetable fibres and urine volume emerge as two new risk factors for low urinary CI...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{products}} {{which can be}} produced from a country’s natural resources is very important {{as far as the}} industrialization of a nation and saving foreign exchange is concerned. Presently, industries in Uganda and the other states in the Lake Victoria region import all refractory-related-consumables, as the demand cannot be met locally. Based on the abundance of ceramic raw materials for high temperature applications in the region and the demand for refractories by industries it is pertinent to develop and manufacture firebricks by exploiting the locally available raw materials. This thesis thus, concerns the characterisation of ceramic raw mineral powders from the Lake Victoria region, more particularly, Uganda, with the aim of developing firebrick refractories from the minerals. Two main deposits of kaolin and a ball clay deposit were investigated to assess their potential in the manufacture of refractory bricks. Raw- and processed sample powders were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal analysis (DTA-TG) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In addition, the chemical composition, particle size distribution, density, and surface area of the powders were determined. A comprehensive study on beneficiation of Mutaka kaolin was carried out using mechanical segregation of particles. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore other potential applications like in paper filling and coating. The beneficiation process improves the chemical composition of kaolin to almost pure, the major impurity being iron oxide. A general production process scheme for manufacturing fireclay bricks starting with raw powder minerals (Mutaka kaolin and Mukono ball clay) was used to make six groups of sample fireclay brick. Experimental results from the characterization of formulated sample bricks indeed revealed the viability of manufacturing fireclay bricks from the raw minerals. Based on these results, industrial samples were formulated and manufactured at Höganäs Bjuf AB, Sweden. Kaolin from the Mutaka deposit was used as the main source of alumina while ball clay from Mukono was the main plasticizer and binder material. The formulated green body was consolidated by wet pressing and fired at 1350 °C in a tunnel kiln. Characterization of the sintered articles was done by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and chemical composition (ICP-AES). In addition, technological properties related to thermal conductivity, thermal shock, <b>alkali</b> resistance, water <b>absorption,</b> porosity, shrinkage, permanent linear change (PLC), linear thermal expansion, refractoriness under load (RUL), and cold crushing strength were determined. The properties of the articles manufactured from the selected naturally occurring raw minerals reveal that the produced articles compare favourably with those of parallel types. Thus, the raw materials can be exploited for industrial production. QC 2010102...|$|R
40|$|Different forest types exert {{essential}} {{impacts on}} soil physical-chemical characteristics by dominant tree species producing diverse litters and root exudates, thereby further regulating size and activity of soil microbial communities. However, the study accuracy is usually restricted by differences in climate, soil type and forest age. Our {{objective is to}} precisely quantify soil microbial biomass, basal respiration and enzyme activity of five natural secondary forest (NSF) types with the same stand age and soil type in a small climate region and to evaluate relationship between soil microbial and physical-chemical characters. We determined soil physical-chemical indices and used the chloroform fumigation-extraction method, <b>alkali</b> <b>absorption</b> method and titration or colorimetry to obtain the microbial data. Our results showed that soil physical-chemical characters remarkably differed among the NSFs. Microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) was the highest in wilson spruce soils, while microbial biomass nitrogen (Nmic) was the highest in sharptooth oak soils. Moreover, the highest basal respiration {{was found in the}} spruce soils, but mixed, Chinese pine and spruce stands exhibited a higher soil qCO 2. The spruce soils had the highest Cmic/Nmic ratio, the greatest Nmic/TN and Cmic/Corg ratios were found in the oak soils. Additionally, the spruce soils had the maximum invertase activity and the minimum urease and catalase activities, but the maximum urease and catalase activities were found in the mixed stand. The Pearson correlation and principle component analyses revealed that the soils of spruce and oak stands obviously discriminated from other NSFs, whereas the others were similar. Thi...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{application}} of organic residues to reclaim soils requires the optimization {{of the waste}} management to minimize CO 2 emissions and optimize soil C sequestration efficiency. In this study, the short-term effects of pig slurry amendment alone and together with marble waste on organic matter mineralization in two tailing ponds from Cartagena-La Unión Mining District (SE Spain) were investigated in a field remediation experiment. The treatments were: marble waste (MW), pig slurry (PS), marble waste + pig slurry (MW+PS), and control. Soil carbon mineralization was determined using a static chamber method with <b>alkali</b> <b>absorption</b> during 70 days. Soil respiration rates in all plots were higher {{the first days of}} the experiment owing to higher soil moisture and higher mean air temperature. MW plots followed the same pattern than control plots, with similar respiration rates. The addition of pig slurry caused {{a significant increase in the}} respiration rates, although in MW+PS plots, respiration rates were lower than in PS plots. The cumulative quantities of C-CO 2 evolved from the pig slurry mineralization were fitted to a first-order kinetic model explaining 90 % of the data. This model implies the presence of only one mineralisable pool (C 0). The values of the index C 0 *constant rate/added C were similar for PS plots in both tailing ponds, but lower in the MW+PS treatment, suggesting that the {{application of}} marble reduces the degradability of the organic compounds present in the pig slurry. Thus, the application of marble wastes contributes to slow down the loss of organic matter by mineralization...|$|E
40|$|We present {{commissioning}} {{data from}} the OSIRIS integral field spectrograph (IFS) on the Keck II 10 m telescope that demonstrate the utility of adaptive optics IFS spectroscopy in studying faint close-in sub-stellar companions in the haloes of bright stars. Our R~ 2000 J- and H-band spectra of the sub-stellar companion to the 1 - 10 Myr-old GQ Lup complement existing K-band spectra and photometry, and improve on the original estimate of its spectral type. We find that GQ Lup B is somewhat hotter (M 6 -L 0) than reported in the discovery paper by Neuhauser and collaborators (M 9 -L 4), mainly due to the surface-gravity sensitivity of the K-band spectral classification indices used by the discoverers. Spectroscopic features characteristic of low surface gravity objects, such as lack of <b>alkali</b> <b>absorption</b> and a triangular H-band continuum, are indeed prominent in our spectrum of GQ Lup B. The peculiar shape of the H-band continuum {{and the difference between}} the two spectral type estimates is well explained in the context of the diminishing strength of H 2 collision induced absorption with decreasing surface gravity, as recently proposed for young ultra-cool dwarfs by Kirkpatrick and collaborators. Using our updated spectroscopic classification of GQ Lup B and a re-evaluation of the age and heliocentric distance of the primary, we perform a comparative analysis of the available sub-stellar evolutionary models to estimate the mass of the companion. We find that the mass of GQ Lup B is 0. 010 - 0. 040 Msun. Hence, it is unlikely to be a wide-orbit counterpart to the known radial-velocity extrasolar planets, whose masses are < 0. 015 Msun. Instead, GQ Lup A/B is probably a member of a growing family of very low mass ratio widely separated binaries discovered through high-contrast imaging.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Fruits and {{vegetables}} are natural suppliers of potassium, bicarbonate, or bicarbonate precursors such as citrate, malate and others-hence, possessing potential effects on citraturia. We aimed to compare the acute effects of a noncitrus (melon) fruit vs citric ones (orange and lime) on citraturia and other lithogenic parameters. Patients and Methods: Two-hour urine samples were collected from 30 hypocitraturic stone-forming patients after an overnight fast and 2, 4, and 6 hours after the consumption of 385 mL (13 oz) of either freshly squeezed orange juice (n = 10), freshly blended melon juice (n = 10), or freshly squeezed lime juice (n = 10). Urinary citrate, potassium, pH, and other lithogenic parameters were determined and net gastrointestinal <b>alkali</b> <b>absorption</b> (NGIA) was calculated. Potential renal acid load (PRAL) and pH from juices were determined. Results: Significant and comparable increases of mean urinary citrate were observed in all groups, whereas mean urinary potassium, pH, and NGIA were significantly increased only after consumption of melon and orange juices. the pH of melon juice was higher and the PRAL value was more negative compared with orange juice, indicating a higher alkalinity. Conclusions: These findings suggested that melon, a noncitrus source of potassium, citrate, and malate, yielded an increase in urinary citrate excretion equivalent to that provided by orange, and hence represents another dietary alternative {{for the treatment of}} hypocitraturic stone-formers. Despite its low potassium content, lime also produced comparable increases in citraturia possibly because of its high citric acid content.

40|$|GJ 436 b {{is a prime}} {{target for}} {{understanding}} warm Neptune exoplanet atmospheres and a target for multiple JWST GTO programs. Here, we report the first space-based optical transmission spectrum of the planet using two HST/STIS transit observations from 0. 53 - 1. 03 microns. We find no evidence for <b>alkali</b> <b>absorption</b> features, nor evidence of a scattering slope longward of 0. 53 microns. The spectrum is indicative of moderate to high metallicity (~ 100 - 1000 x solar) while moderate metallicity scenarios (~ 100 x solar) require aerosol opacity. The optical spectrum also rules out some highly scattering haze models. We find an increase in transit depth around 0. 8 microns in the transmission spectra of 3 different sub-Jovian exoplanets (GJ 436 b, HAT-P- 26 b, and GJ 1214 b). While most of the data come from STIS, data from three other instruments may indicate {{this is not an}} instrumental effect. Only the transit spectrum of GJ 1214 b is well fit by a model with stellar plages on the photosphere of the host star. Our photometric monitoring of the host star reveals a stellar rotation rate of 44. 1 days and an activity cycle of 7. 4 years. Intriguingly, GJ 436 does not become redder as it gets dimmer, which is expected if star spots were dominating the variability. These insights into the nature of the GJ 436 system help refine our expectations for future observations in the era of JWST, whose higher precision and broader wavelength coverage will shed light on the composition and structure of GJ 436 b's atmosphere.
