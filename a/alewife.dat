In 1927, the Fitchburg Cutoff became freight-only between the <b>Alewife</b> area and Somerville Junction. Passenger trains from the Lexington Branch and the Central Massachusetts Railroad were diverted to the Fitchburg mainline and began to stop at Cambridge station. In 1937, the Boston and Maine Railroad built a two-story brick depot by the bridge, with the ticket office at street level and the waiting room and platforms below.|$|E
5|$|The fish is carnivorous, {{with its}} prey {{consisting}} mainly of benthic invertebrates and fishes. Such food items include polychaetes, gastropods, bivalve mollusks, rock crabs, cancer crabs, spider crabs, lobsters, shrimps, squids, and fishes including spiny dogfish, <b>alewife,</b> Atlantic herring, menhaden, hakes, sculpins, cunner, tautog, sand lance, butterfish, and various flounders. Juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, isopods, crangon shrimp, and euphausiids. Individuals {{have been found}} with the denticles on the snout worn smooth, indicating that the snout is used to dig in the mud or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks.|$|E
5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{are both}} open for fishing. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) has {{established}} fishing regulations, such as catch and length limits, that {{are meant to}} enhance sport fisheries in public waters such as Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River. The NCWRC has had regulations in place at Pettigrew State Park since 2002. The regulations specify that anglers may keep largemouth bass that are greater than 20inches (50.8cm) or between 14 and 16inches (35.6-40.6cm). This rule {{was put in place}} {{to increase the number of}} tropy fish, fish over 20inches (50.8cm). Additionally the NCWRC stocks Lake Phelps with bluegill and they have begun a program to reintroduce <b>alewife</b> and blueback herring via fish ladder on Bee Tree Canal from the Scuppernong River.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} involves <b>alewives</b> {{of highly}} aligned single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT), process {{for making the}} same and compositions thereof.

40|$|Intraspecific {{phenotypic}} {{variation in}} ecologically important traits is widespread and important for evolutionary processes, but {{its effects on}} community and ecosystem processes are poorly understood. We use life history differences among populations of <b>alewives,</b> Alosa pseudoharengus, to test the effects of intraspecific phenotypic variation in a predator on pelagic zooplankton community structure {{and the strength of}} cascading trophic interactions. We focus on the effects of differences in (1) the duration of residence in fresh water (either seasonal or year-round) and (2) differences in foraging morphology, both of which may strongly influence interactions between <b>alewives</b> and their prey. We measured zooplankton community structure, algal biomass, and spring total phosphorus in lakes that contained landlocked, anadromous, or no <b>alewives.</b> Both the duration of residence and the intraspecific variation in foraging morphology strongly influenced zooplankton community structure. Lakes with landlocked <b>alewives</b> had small-bodied zooplankton year-round, and lakes with no <b>alewives</b> had large-bodied zooplankton year-round. In contrast, zooplankton communities in lakes with anadromous <b>alewives</b> cycled between large-bodied zooplankton in the winter and spring and small-bodied zooplankton in the summer. In summer, differences in feeding morphology of <b>alewives</b> caused zooplankton biomass to be lower and body size to be smaller in lakes with anadromous <b>alewives</b> than in lakes with landlocked <b>alewives.</b> Furthermore, intraspecific variation altered the strength of the trophic cascade caused by <b>alewives.</b> Our results demonstrate that intraspecific phenotypic variation of predators can regulate community structure and ecosystem processes by modifying the form and strength of complex trophic interactions...|$|R

5|$|From the {{introduction}} of Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) funding in 1965 until the mid-2000s, Wedgemere station remained essentially static. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 required transit agencies to make certain stations handicapped accessible. A number of high-ridership stations on the MBTA Commuter Rail system were upgraded, but due to its relatively low ridership — less than 600 riders per day as of 2009 — Wedgemere was not chosen as a key station for upgrades. Wedgemere had older low-level platforms, and access from the street was via stairs only. Beginning in 2008, a local family lobbied the MBTA to make the station accessible; in July 2009, the Federal Transit Administration granted the MBTA permission to build mini-high platforms. (Full-length high level platforms {{would not have been}} possible because the Lowell Line is a designated freight corridor; full-length platforms cause operational difficulties with freight trains. Wedgemere does not have room for a dedicated freight passing track like Anderson RTC.) In February 2010, the MBTA announced that $2 million in federal stimulus funds had been allotted to the project, part of a grant that also funded construction of the John W. Olver Transit Center and repairs to the Red Line tunnels between Harvard and <b>Alewife.</b> The work was then intended to be finished by the end of 2010.|$|E

25|$|The {{extirpation}} of {{lake trout}} from Lake Ontario in the 1950s left the large lake without an apex predator, leaving prey fish such as <b>alewife</b> and smelt with no natural means of control. <b>Alewife</b> populations exploded, sometimes {{to the point}} of causing die-offs large enough to require the use of bulldozers along Great Lakes' beaches. Seeking to control prey fish populations, the aggressive stocking of coho and Chinook salmon resumed throughout the Great Lakes and their tributaries.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Alewives</b> {{are perhaps}} best known for their {{invasion}} of the Great Lakes by using the Welland Canal to bypass Niagara Falls. <b>Alewives</b> colonized the Great Lakes and became abundant mostly in Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. They reached their peak abundance by the 1950s and 1980s. <b>Alewives</b> grew in number unchecked {{because of the lack of}} a top predator in the lakes (lake trout were essentially wiped out around the same time by overfishing and the invasion of the sea lamprey). For a time, <b>alewives,</b> which often exhibit seasonal die-offs, washed up in windrows on the shorelines of the Great Lakes. Various species of Pacific salmon (first coho, and later the Chinook salmon) were introduced as predators. Though marginally successful, this led to the development of a salmon/alewife fishery popular with many sport anglers ...|$|R

25|$|Salmon {{populations have}} been {{established}} in all the Great Lakes. Coho stocks were planted {{by the state of}} Michigan in the late 1960s to control the growing population of non-native <b>alewife.</b> Now Chinook (king), Atlantic, and coho (silver) salmon are annually stocked in all Great Lakes by most bordering states and provinces. These populations are not self-sustaining and do not provide {{much in the way of}} a commercial fishery, but have led to the development of a thriving sport fishery.|$|E
25|$|The <b>alewife</b> {{first entered}} the system west of Lake Ontario via 19th-century canals. By the 1960s, the small silver fish {{had become a}} {{familiar}} nuisance to beach goers across Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie. Periodic mass dieoffs result in vast numbers of the fish washing up on shore; estimates by various governments have placed the percentage of Lake Michigan's biomass, which {{was made up of}} alewives in the early 1960s, as high as 90%. In the late 1960s, the various state and federal governments began stocking several species of salmonids, including the native lake trout as well as non-native chinook and coho salmon; by the 1980s, <b>alewife</b> populations had dropped drastically. The ruffe, a small percid fish from Eurasia, became the most abundant fish species in Lake Superior's Saint Louis River within five years of its detection in 1986. Its range, which has expanded to Lake Huron, poses a significant threat to the lower lake fishery. Five years after first being observed in the St. Clair River, the round goby can now be found in all of the Great Lakes. The goby is considered undesirable for several reasons: it preys upon bottom-feeding fish, overruns optimal habitat, spawns multiple times a season, and can survive poor water quality conditions.|$|E
40|$|The {{unauthorized}} {{introduction of}} <b>alewives</b> (Alosa pseudoharengus) into Otsego Lake has caused ecological changes related to trophic interactions in the zooplankton communities. To determine {{the effect of}} these changes on the diet of lake trout, gill nets and angler surveys were conducted to collect stomachs for analysis in the lab. Findings were compared to a lake trout study by the Department of Environmental Conservation before <b>alewives</b> were introduced (Sanford 1984). Shifts in the optimal levels of dissolved oxygen were observed due to the decomposition of algae, limiting the appropriate forage area for lake trout. Midges were the principal invertebrate prey for lake trout 450 mm shifted from slimy sculpins (Cottus cognatus) to <b>alewives</b> as dominant fish prey...|$|R

25|$|Lake Michigan {{is home to}} a {{wide variety}} of fish species and other organisms. It was {{originally}} home to lake whitefish, lake trout, yellow perch, panfish, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and bowfin, as well as some species of catfish. As a result of improvements to the Welland Canal in 1919, an invasion of sea lampreys and overharvesting, there has been a decline in native lake trout populations, ultimately causing an increase in the population of another invasive species, the <b>alewife.</b> As a result, salmonids, including various strains of brown trout, steelhead (rainbow trout), coho and chinook salmon, were introduced as predators in order to decrease the <b>alewife</b> population. This program was so successful that the introduced population of trout and salmon exploded, resulting in the creation of a large sport fishery for these introduced species. Lake Michigan is now stocked annually with steelhead, brown trout, and coho and chinook salmon, which have also begun natural reproduction in some Lake Michigan tributaries. However, several introduced invasive species, such as lampreys, round goby, zebra mussels and quagga mussels, continue to cause major changes in water clarity and fertility, resulting in knock-on changes to Lake Michigan's ecosystem, threatening the vitality of native fish populations.|$|E
25|$|American eels {{enters the}} river from the Hudson every spring, moving {{upstream}} {{over the course of}} one to three years. The eels often accumulate under a dam in Sleepy Hollow, and approximately 10% make it past the dam. The eels move upstream where the habitat is preferable, with lower polychlorinated biphenyl pollution, fewer parasites, faster growth rates for the eels, and a higher percentage of females in the population. Other species in the river include white perch, white sucker, yellow perch, golden shiner, and <b>Alewife,</b> only in small numbers.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources planted Chinook in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron {{to control}} the <b>alewife,</b> an {{invasive}} species of nuisance fish from the Atlantic Ocean.

Chinook and Coho salmon thrived on the alewives and spawned in the lakes' tributaries. After this success, Chinook were planted in the other Great Lakes, where sport fishermen prize them for their aggressive behavior on the hook.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —Energy {{content is}} an {{important}} determinant of an individual fish’s condition and a key input variable for bioenergetics applications. Energy content of young fish can change rapidly during ontogeny; given the numerical abundance and high mass-specific metabolic rates of young fish, it is particularly important to obtain detailed information on their energy content. To this end, we quantified the total body energy content and energy density of economically and ecologically important young (age- 0 – 1) nonnative <b>alewives</b> Alosa pseudoharengus collected during 1998 – 2003 in eastern Lake Michigan and Muskegon Lake, a connected drowned river mouth lake. Our analysis demonstrates that energy content of young <b>alewives</b> varies across years, seasons, lakes, and ontogeny. Consistent with previous observations of size-dependent overwinter mortality, young <b>alewives</b> deplete {{a large amount of}} body energy between late fall and late spring (i. e., declines in length-specific energy content and energy density occur overwinter). Interestingly, unlike several past studies of young fish in their native range, size-specific energy content of young <b>alewives</b> does not appear to increase over the summer and fall (there is no evidence of increased energy storage in preparation for the resource-scarce winter period). Finally, our measured values are similar to the few previously published energy density values for age- 0 <b>alewives.</b> The high degree of variation in the energy content of young fish emphasizes the necessity of using appropriate energy measures for bioenergetic...|$|R
