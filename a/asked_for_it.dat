5|$|Although {{nothing is}} {{happening}} in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess Artemis <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death.|$|E

Released in 2013 to multiple film festivals, Tome of the Unknown has received several accolades.|$|E
5|$|In 1951 the Israeli army summoned {{representatives of}} the World Lutheran Church to remove {{religious}} artifacts from the orphanage church; church representatives removed bells, windows and a pipe organ, but left the heavy marble altar encased in a wooden chest. The church was then converted into a basketball arena for the soldiers. In October 2009, {{on a tour of}} the facility after the army had vacated the grounds, the provost of the Evangelical German Lutheran Church of the Redeemer noticed the chest and <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be opened, exposing the altar. The Lutherans negotiated for it to be moved to the Lutheran church at Augusta Victoria Hospital, where it was inaugurated in November 2010.|$|E

5|$|Little {{was seen}} of Katsura {{for the next}} few years. She made 30 {{exhibition}} appearances in 1958, and went on a one-week exhibition engagement the following year with Harold Worst, but did not compete in any professional tournaments. In 1959, she made two television appearances on ABC's You <b>Asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>It,</b> and one on the CBS primetime television hit What's My Line?. Katsura returned to competition in 1961, playing a challenge match for the World Three-Cushion title against Worst, then reigning world champion, and was defeated by him. Katsura disappeared from the sport thereafter, only making a brief impromptu appearance in 1976. She moved back to Japan in about 1990 and died in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Mimi had {{relatives}} in Eketahuna, New Zealand, because her maternal aunt, Harriet Millward, had married and moved there. Mimi had exchanged letters with her relatives over the years, so Lennon {{arranged for a}} tour of New Zealand in 1964. The success of The Beatles caused problems for {{her and she was}} constantly pestered by fans at 'Mendips', so she sold the house for £6,000 in 1965; Lennon bought her a £25,000 bungalow by the beach called Harbour's Edge in Sandbanks, at 126 Panorama Road, Poole, Dorset, which was her home {{for the rest of her}} life. The Lennons and their son visited her there in the summer of 1965, which was the last time all three of them visited the house together. Lennon later gave his aunt his MBE medal, but later <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> back so that he could return it in protest.|$|E
5|$|The {{engineering}} set {{did provide}} some challenges; a {{health and safety}} brief was required for the actors on it as it was still raised off the ground. Furthermore, {{the results of the}} bubbles being sent through water tubes that represented part of the engine core created noise issues for the sound technicians; they <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be turned off whenever it wasn't placed in shot. One of the special effects went wrong, causing an actual explosion behind Jeri Ryan rather than simply creating sparks following the weapons fire which would be edited in during post-optical effects. The explosion remained in the final cut. The final day of the shoot took place on March 10; taking the filming period to eight days, a day longer than normal for Voyager episodes. It took place on the set of the Dauntless bridge, in the orange color scheme. The final full scene filmed was of the scene {{at the end of the}} episode where the Dauntless returns to Borg space and Arturis realises he is about to be assimilated, and after an hour of closeups for various scenes, the shoot ended at 12:50am on March 11.|$|E

After the government had amended the war crimes law to allow a sentence to be appealed based on leniency of punishment, prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court of Bangladesh and <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to upgrade Molla's sentence from life in prison to death. On 17 September 2013, the Supreme Court accepted the appeal and sentenced Molla to death. Finally he was hanged in Dhaka Central Jail on 12 December 2013 at 22:01.|$|E

He tied the string to an ant, which walked through the seashell, stringing it all the way through. Minos then knew Daedalus was in the court of King Cocalus and demanded he be handed over. Cocalus managed to convince him to take a bath first; then Cocalus' daughters and Daedalus, with Minos trapped in the bath, scalded him to death with boiling water.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{this initial}} donation, {{a lack of}} funds was to plague University College, Bristol up until the {{donations}} which allowed it to lobby for a Royal Charter. Initially the financial response to the meeting was disappointing, with the College gaining only £25,991 of the £40,000 funds which it <b>asked</b> <b>for.</b> <b>It</b> was at this stage that the Wills family {{became involved in the}} project with Henry Overton Wills donating £250 to the project. The lacklustre response to the call for funds had the immediate result of delaying the opening of the College until 1876, and meant that when it did open it was under the most stringent financial conditions. Shelborne notes that the setting up of the College struggled {{due to the fact that}} Bristol lacked a significant industry which saw benefit in the creation a college, an absence of the nouveaux riches, and no philanthropic industrialists who wished to highlight the importance of Bristol.|$|E
25|$|On 17 July Hullett {{wrote out}} a cheque for Adams for £1,000 – {{to pay for}} an MG car her husband had promised to buy him.

On 19 July Hullett is thought to have taken an overdose and was found the next morning in a coma. Adams was unavailable and a colleague, Dr Harris, attended her until Adams arrived later in the day. Not once during their discussion did Adams mention her depression or her barbiturate medication. They decided a cerebral haemorrhage was most likely. On 21 July Dr Shera, a pathologist, was called in to take a spinal fluid sample and immediately asked if her stomach contents should be examined in case of narcotic poisoning. Adams and Harris both opposed this. After Shera left, Adams visited a colleague at the Princess Alice Hospital in Eastbourne and asked about the treatment for barbiturate poisoning. He was told to give doses of 10cc of Megimide every five minutes, and was given 100cc to use. The recommended dose in the instructions was 100cc to 200cc. Dr Cook also told him to put Hullett on an intravenous drip. Adams did not.|$|E
