At the Masters, he defeated Mark Williams 6–5 in the first round, Mark Selby 6–3 in the quarter-finals, and Stuart Bingham 6–3 in the semi-finals to reach the eleventh Masters final of his career. He defeated Barry Hawkins 10–1 in the final to win his sixth Masters title and equal Stephen Hendry's record for the most Masters wins.|$|E

5|$|The {{railroad}} {{has been}} consistently billed as one of Disneyland's top attractions, requiring <b>a</b> C <b>ticket</b> <b>to</b> ride when <b>A,</b> B, and C tickets were introduced in 1955, <b>a</b> D <b>ticket</b> <b>to</b> ride when those were introduced in 1956, and <b>an</b> E <b>ticket</b> <b>to</b> ride when those were introduced in 1959. The use of E <b>tickets</b> stood until <b>a</b> pay-one-price admission system was introduced in 1982.

5|$|Lody {{left his}} boarding-house hastily {{on the morning}} of 27 September and stayed {{overnight}} at the Roxburgh Hotel in Edinburgh. He left some of his luggage there, telling the manageress that he would be away for about eight days, and travelled the next day to Liverpool, where he took a room at the London and North Western Hotel on Lime Street. He bought <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> <b>to</b> Ireland and took the SS Munster to Dublin via Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire). It stopped at Holyhead in Anglesey, where an immigration official challenged Lody. His American travel documents proved sufficient to demonstrate his bona fides, and he proceeded on his way.|$|E

Nelson tried to hitchhike, but after nobody picked him up, he slept in a ditch. He then found a nearby {{railroad}} yard and boarded a freight train that left him in Eugene. A truck driver then drove Nelson to a bus station and loaned him $10 for <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> <b>to</b> reach Portland.|$|E
5|$|The Chumscrubber premiered on January 25, 2005 at the Sundance Film Festival. It {{went on to}} {{be shown}} at the 27th Moscow International Film Festival in June 2005, where it won the Audience Award. The film was {{released}} theatrically in the United States on August 5, 2005, playing in 28 theaters. It earned US$28,548 on its opening weekend, ranking 59th at the box office. It closed after two weeks in release with a total domestic gross of $52,597. The film's highest-grossing overseas releases were in Australia with $96,696, Germany with $81,323, and Greece with $71,100. It earned only £36 from its single-weekend release in the United Kingdom, meaning that only six people paid for <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> <b>to</b> see the film. With a total foreign gross of $298,804, the film's total worldwide gross was $351,401 and was a box office bomb.|$|E

5|$|Georgia Tech {{football}} was Atlanta's one major sports franchise {{during this time}} frame. To hold <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> <b>to</b> watch the Yellow Jackets play was highly valued and was difficult to obtain. During the games, Bobby Dodd sat in a folding chair at a card table on the side line, rarely standing or showing interest in the game. Dodd took his seat and left the pacing to his assistants. When a crisis arose, Dodd would decide which plays to be run and the designated players to run them. Dodd sometimes made unusual substitutions, as on a Saturday in Athens when Georgia Tech {{was about to be}} upset. Dodd sent in a small halfback who had been frequently injured during his career, who then broke to the right faking a run, stopped, threw a pass for a touchdown and returned to the bench. What Dodd brought to Grant Field was a kind of unbruising football other coaches couldn't understand: runty halfbacks; lightweight linemen; rarely a classic quarterback. Once free substitution became possible, no one made more use of it than Dodd.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-five {{cents for}} {{no more than a few}} minutes of {{entertainment}} was hardly cheap diversion. For the same amount, one could purchase <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> <b>to</b> a major vaudeville theater; when America's first amusement park opened in Coney Island the following year, a 25-cent entrance fee covered admission to three rides, a performing sea lion show, and a dance hall. The Kinetoscope was an immediate success, however, and by June 1, the Hollands were also operating venues in Chicago and San Francisco. Entrepreneurs (including Raff and Gammon, with their own International Novelty Co.) were soon running Kinetoscope parlors and temporary exhibition venues around the United States. New firms joined the Kinetoscope Company in commissioning and marketing the machines. The Kinetoscope exhibition spaces were largely, though not uniformly, profitable. After fifty weeks in operation, the Hollands' New York parlor had generated approximately $1,400 in monthly receipts against an estimated $515 in monthly operating costs; receipts from the Chicago venue (located in a Masonic temple) were substantially lower, about $700 a month, though presumably operating costs were lower as well. For each machine, Edison's business at first generally charged $250 to the Kinetoscope Company and other distributors, which would use them in their own exhibition parlors or resell them to independent exhibitors; individual films were initially priced by Edison at $10. During the Kinetoscope's first eleven months of commercialization, the sale of viewing machines, films, and auxiliary items generated a profit of more than $85,000 for Edison's company.|$|E

25|$|The Arlanda Line in its {{entirety}} {{is owned by the}} state-owned Arlanda Infrastructure, which also owns platforms 1 and 2 at StockholmC. A-Train holds a monopoly on the right to transport passengers from Stockholm to Arlanda; other train operators only have the right to transport passengers to the airport from other towns and cities. In 2008, the cost of a boarding or embarking passenger at ArlandaC was SEK75. This results in a ticket from Uppsala to Arlanda costing SEK136, while a ticket on the same train but traveling onwards to StockholmC only costs SEK64. Similarly the cost of <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> <b>to</b> the airport with the Arlanda Express is considerably higher than that of <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> <b>to</b> Uppsala, which is twice as far away.|$|E

However, this wasn't enough to mollify several fans, who on February 9 filed a $5 million class-action lawsuit against the NFL, the Cowboys and Jones. In addition to Steelers and Packers fans left without seats, the suit includes Cowboys fans who paid $100,000 for personal seat licenses, only to have to watch the Super Bowl in metal folding chairs without a view of the stadium's giant video replay board. The NFL at first offered $2,400 to fans who did not receive a replacement seat, but later offered tickets to a future Super Bowl with airfare and hotels included.|$|E
