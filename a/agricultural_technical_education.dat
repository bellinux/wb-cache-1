The districts are situated at 217 kms South West of Addis Ababa at longitude of 38 ° 30 ′East and altitude of 7 ° 30 ′North with an altitude of 1600 above sea level. The area is characterized by mild sub tropical climate with average minimum and maximum temperature of 11 and 29  °C respectively. There are two defined rainy seasons: short rainy season (March–April), long rainy season (June–September). These two PAs have high cattle population compared to other PAs in the area.

The case study from Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan serves as an excellent example. This province {{is one of the most}} stable and secure provinces in Afghanistan. For example, over 100,000 Afghans have returned to province; the province has also been declared poppy-free in 2007 by the UN. Additionally, most districts within the province have all-weather paved roads and it is also one of the most productive agricultural regions in Afghanistan. ADT should further its progress within the provinces of Afghanistan in <b>agricultural</b> <b>education,</b> <b>technical</b> support, and logistics. To defeat the insurgency in Afghanistan public diplomacy is an essential force, ADTs help the US educate the population of Afghanistan with the hope of strengthening Afghan trust in the American mission in Afghanistan.|$|R

A total of 234 students participated in the study;A five-part instrument was developed and used to collect data pertinent to the study. Descriptive and inferential statistical procedures were used to analyze the data;The following is a summary of the major findings of the study. Respondents were aged between 18 and 43 years, of which the mean was 25 years. More than 47 percent were ordinary diploma students, whereas over 52 percent were higher diploma students. Over 75 percent of the respondents were males and just under 25 percent were females.

40|$|Gebreyohannes Berhane is ILRI authorThe {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} Maichew <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Technical</b> Vocational <b>Education</b> and Training College, Ethiopia. Twenty four male yearling Tigray Highland sheep with mean body weight (BW) of 21 ± 2. 6 kg (mean ± S. D.) were used to investigate the effect of different protein sources on feed intake, nutrient digestibility, BW change and carcass parameters in a study comprising of 90 days feeding trial, followed by 7 days of digestibility trial and evaluation of carcass parameters. Six individually fed animals were used per treatment in a randomized complete block design. The treatments consisted of ad libitum feeding of tef (Eragrostis tef) straw plus 172 g dry matter (DM) of cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) pear (T 1, control) and supplementation with 145 g DM cotton seed cake (CSC) (T 2), 195 g DM noug seed cake (NSC) (T 3) or 149 g DM peanut cake (PNC) (T 4) per head per day. The quantity of the supplements was set to supply 62. 5 g crude protein (CP). Tef straw DM intake was depressed (P< 0. 01) {{as the result of}} NSC supplementation. Sheep supplemented with CSC and PNC had higher (P< 0. 001) total DM intake than the control and NSC supplemented ones. Supplementation with NSC and PNC also resulted in higher (P< 0. 01) apparent digestibility of DM and OM compared to the control treatment. Supplementation with CSC and PNC resulted in better daily BW gain (P< 0. 001), feed conversion efficiency (FCE) and dressed carcass weight (P< 0. 01) compared to the non-supplemented diet. Dressing percentage on slaughter weight base was higher (P< 0. 01) in supplemented sheep than in the non-supplemented ones. Supplementation with PNC also promoted higher (P< 0. 05) rib-eye muscle area than in the non-supplemented ones. It was concluded that supplementation with 145 g DM CSC and 149 g DM PNC resulted in better feed intake, BW gain and carcass traits in cactus–tef straw based feeding of sheep...|$|R
