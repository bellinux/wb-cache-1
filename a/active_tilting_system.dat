50|$|The TGV 001 {{turbotrain}} was a {{test train}} for a vast research program encompassing traction, vehicle dynamics, braking, aerodynamics, signalling, and other technologies {{that needed to be}} developed to allow higher speeds. Only one was ever built, although it was originally planned to build a second version equipped with an <b>active</b> <b>tilt</b> <b>system.</b> The studies for the tilting version were completed, but it never reached construction because of technical difficulties with fitting the <b>tilt</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Faced {{with this}} {{daunting}} infrastructure problem, both CN and Via opted {{to improve performance}} using [...] "medium-speed" [...] services using tilting trains. The first of these was CN's introduction of the UAC TurboTrain in the late 1960s, which featured a passive <b>tilt</b> <b>system</b> adapted from the Spanish Talgo designs. Via inherited the Turbo, but soon after replaced them with the LRC of similar performance, featuring a locally-designed <b>active</b> <b>tilt</b> <b>system.</b> Both sets were capable of relatively high speeds, around 125 mph (200 km/h), but limitations due to track quality, signalling and scheduling limited speeds to 100 mph or less.|$|R
50|$|In 1965, Wickens {{had hired}} an intern, Dutch {{engineer}} A.J. Ispeert, {{and had him}} do some early work on <b>active</b> <b>tilt</b> <b>systems.</b> These would replace the passive pendulum-like Talgo system with a system using hydraulic cylinders that would quickly drive {{the car to the}} proper angle and hold it there without any swinging. A major advantage for BR use was that the center of rotation could be through the middle of the car, instead of the top, meaning the total movement would fit within the smaller British loading gauge. Ispeert returned a report on the concept in August 1966.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} timeline {{is also a}} {{topic of}} considerable discussion. It is useful to contrast the APT project with the Canadian LRC; LRC began development {{at the same time}} as APT, developed a unique <b>active</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>system</b> of its own, and entered production in the late 1970s. Like APT, LRC also faced teething problems that took some time before they were solved, and was subject to some press chiding over these failures. Unlike APT, LRC had no competition and management was in a hurry to remove the Turbo from service. The system was given the time it needed to mature with no serious possibility of cancellation.|$|E
50|$|TGV 001 (Train Grande Vitesse 001) was a {{high-speed}} railway train built in France. It {{was the first}} TGV prototype and was commissioned in 1969, to begin testing in 1972. The TGV 001 was an experimental gas turbine-electric locomotive-powered trainset built by Alstom to break speed records between 250 - 300 km/h.The experimental train {{was part of a}} vast research program on high rail speeds. This program covered all technical aspects, principally traction, the behaviour of the vehicles, braking, aerodynamics and signalling. Originally, two trains were to be built, but only one was produced. The second was to be a tilting train equipped with an <b>active</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>system,</b> but was abandoned owing to technical difficulties.|$|E
50|$|The next {{attempt was}} made with DMUs and the well proven Italian {{hydraulic}} <b>active</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>system.</b> Between 1988 and 1990 DB commissioned 20 class 610 units for fast regional traffic. This time the results were quite satisfying and allowed a significant reduction of running times. Class 610 was followed by class 611 which basically was built for the same purpose (fast regional traffic with up to 160 km/h on twisting non-electrified lines). Class 611's tilting system was electric, with a maximum 8° tilt, based on military technology from the Leopard tank. However, after coming into service in 1996 this 50-unit class experienced problems both with the newly developed tilting system as well as chassis and axles, so it was judged not successful. The tilting system was out of service until 2006, when hardened axles and system updates finally solved the problems. In consideration of these problems DB ordered a full re-engineering, resulting {{in the development of}} class 612. Starting in 1998, a total of 192 units were commissioned by DB. The tilting system was reliable, but when in 2004 cracks were detected in a number of wheel sets, again wheels and axles had to be replaced. Today class 612 is back to tilting operation and forms the backbone of DB's fast regional service on non-electrified lines. Additional units were sold to Croatia, where they are used for InterCity services.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{solution}} to this problem had been developed in the 1950s but not widely used: tilting trains. Tilting trains rock into the curve to tilt the passenger cars the same way that a superelevated track would tilt them inward. <b>Tilting</b> <b>systems</b> had been introduced in service by the Spanish Talgo, but this system was [...] "passive" [...] and took some time to respond to curves. A great improvement can be made by making the system [...] "active", reading the forces on the cars with sensors and quickly rotating them to the proper angle using hydraulic rams. British Rail ran an extensive experimental program on <b>active</b> <b>tilt</b> <b>systems</b> in the 1960s that was highly influential, and followed these studies in the 1970s with a new tilting train design, the Advanced Passenger Train (APT). The technical design objectives for the APT included a maximum speed 50% higher than existing trains, curving speeds 40% higher, all while running on existing tracks within the limits of existing signals.|$|R
50|$|On August 26, 2016, U.S. {{passenger}} rail operator Amtrak and Alstom {{announced that the}} Avelia Liberty trainset had been chosen to replace the existing Bombardier-Alstom Acela Express trainsets on the Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington via New York. The new trainsets, along with track and signaling improvements, will allow for an initial improvement in maximum regular service speed to 160 mph on some portions of the route, with a maximum possible speed of 186 mph - 220 mph if future investments in track and signaling upgrades are made. Amtrak will acquire 28 trainsets, allowing for more frequent service on the route, including half-hourly peak service between New York and Washington; in addition, the new trains will have approximately one-third greater passenger capacity. The trainsets will be equipped with an <b>active</b> <b>tilt</b> <b>system,</b> dubbed Tiltronix by Alstom, that will allow higher speeds on curved portions of the corridor track.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT−Narrow {{commuter}} vehicles {{can address}} many congestion, parking and pollution {{issues associated with}} urban transportation. In making narrow vehicles safe, comfortable and acceptable to the public, <b>active</b> <b>tilt</b> control <b>systems</b> are likely to play a crucial role. This paper focuses {{on the development of}} an <b>active</b> direct <b>tilt</b> control <b>system</b> for a narrow vehicle that utilizes an actuator in the vehicle suspension. A simple PD controller can stabilize the tilt dynamics of the vehicle to any desired tilt angle. However, the challenges in the <b>tilt</b> control <b>system</b> design arise in determining the desired lean angle in real-time and in minimizing tilt actuator torque requirements. Minimizing torque requirements requires the tilting and turning of the vehicle to be synchronized as closely as possible. This paper explores two different control design approaches to meet these challenges. A Receding Horizon Controller (RHC) is first developed so as to systematically incorporate preview on road curvature and synchronize tilting with driver initiated turning. Second, a nonlinear control system that utilizes feedback linearization is developed and found to be effective in reducing torque. A close analysis of the complex feedback linearization controller provides insight into which terms are important for reducing actuator effort. This is used to reduce controller complexity and obtain a simple nonlinear controller that provides good performance...|$|R

5000|$|The {{engineers}} at the research division, opened in 1964, had already carried out fundamental work on vehicle dynamics, with the APT {{to a degree}} an extension of this. The existing Chief Mechanical and Electrical Engineers department was overlooked by the new project, creating resentment with its engineers.

50|$|In 1982 Fiat Ferroviaria {{purchased}} BR's <b>active</b> <b>tilting</b> patents {{for development}} of their own tilting train concepts. They had previously developed the locally designed ETR 401 using the Talgo-like pendulum arrangement and tested it in the 1980s. For its second-generation machines, the ETR 450, the company used BR's <b>active</b> <b>tilt.</b> These entered service between Rome and Milan in 1988. This led {{to a series of}} newer designs, known collectively as the Pendolino.

50|$|The first {{tilting train}} in regular public service was the 381 series {{electric}} multiple unit train operated by Japanese National Railways (JNR), which entered revenue service on 10 July 1973 on the Shinano limited express between Nagoya and Nagano on the Chūō Main Line. This technology was not fully implemented worldwide, as the marginally increased curve speeds did not justify the extra expense {{and technology in}} many cases.

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour of the nepheline family: (3) Thermal {{expansion of}} kalsilite THE published structures of SrA 120 4 and BaA 120 4 (Schulze and Mfiller-Buschbaum, 1981; H 6 rkner and Mfiller-Buschbaum, 1979) {{and the change}} in the cell parameters of their solid solution series as a function of temperature and composition (Henderson and Taylor, 1982; Paper 1 of this series) indicated that their structural behaviour could be pictured in terms of two <b>tilt</b> <b>systems.</b> One (<b>tilt</b> l) is a cooperative rotation of the framework tetrahedra about the three-fold axes which lie par-allel to the c-axis, and the other (tilt 2) is a cooperative tilting of the framework tetrahedra relative to the 0001 plane. Both increasing tem-perature and increasing the size of the cavity cation were deduced to cause partial removal of both <b>tilt</b> <b>systems.</b> Distance Least Squares (DLS) modelling of the monoclinic (Ba,Sr) A 1204 solid-solution series has confirmed significant changes in both <b>tilt</b> <b>systems</b> for compositional effects, but smaller changes for thermal effects (Taylor et al., 1985; Paper 2 of this series). It was not possible to explore the behaviour of the two <b>tilt</b> <b>systems</b> for the hexagonal (Ba,Sr) A 1204 solid-solution series by the DLS method because of severe problems in modelling their structures.
