40|$|The {{detection}} of an <b>antineutrophil</b> <b>antibody</b> which is highly sensitive and specific for adult primary sclerosing cholangitis using indirect immunoalkaline phosphatase {{has been previously}} described. In this study, the diagnostic potential of this method in childhood primary sclerosing cholangitis is described. A range of 72 blinded children's sera (36 boys), aged six months to 21 years (10 primary sclerosing cholangitis, eight autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, 10 alpha- 1 antitrypsin deficiency, 12 extrahepatic bile duct atresia, 11 ulcerative colitis and 21 normal subjects) was assayed. Eight of the 10 primary sclerosing cholangitis patients were correctly identified. Three patients with chronic active hepatitis also showed the characteristic primary sclerosing cholangitis pattern of staining. No ulcerative colitis patients or any other patients showed this pattern of staining. All normal subjects were negative. As in adult primary sclerosing cholangitis, there is a specific <b>antineutrophil</b> <b>antibody</b> in childhood primary sclerosing cholangitis and this provides further evidence towards an autoimmune aetiology of this condition.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: <b>Antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibodies</b> are {{reported}} in patients with chronic liver disease, but controversy exists about their prevalence and specificity. We aimed to find the prevalence and specificity of <b>antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibodies</b> in chronic liver diseases by determination of <b>antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibody</b> titre and IgG subclass. METHODS: One hundred and eight-four sera were studied: 63 primary sclerosing cholangitis, 28 autoimmune hepatitis, 34 primary biliary cirrhosis, 12 alcoholic liver disease, five large duct obstruction, four haemochromatosis, one chronic cholestatic syndrome, one cryptogenic cirrhosis and 36 normal individuals. <b>Antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibodies</b> were detected on alcohol-fixed neutrophils using an alkaline phosphatase technique. The IgG subclass of <b>antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibodies</b> was determined using monoclonal antibodies: HP 6001 for IgG 1, HP 6002 for IgG 2, HP 6050 for IgG 3 and SK 44 for IgG 4 (Sigma Immunochemicals). RESULTS: <b>Antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibodies</b> were detected in 65 % of primary sclerosing cholangitis patients at a serum dilution of 1 : 5, dropping to 49 % at 1 : 50. For autoimmune hepatitis, <b>antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibodies</b> were detected in 49 % at 1 : 5, dropping to 11 % at 1 : 50. Only 6 % of primary biliary cirrhosis patients were antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive at 1 : 5, dropping to 3 % at 1 : 50. All other controls were <b>antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibody</b> negative at 1 : 5. The presence of <b>antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibodies</b> in primary sclerosing cholangitis correlated with involvement of the intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree (p = 0. 016, Fisher's exact test), but no other clinical parameters. Determination of the IgG subclass of <b>antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibody</b> in 33 primary sclerosing cholangitis and 11 autoimmune hepatitis patients revealed a predominance of IgG 1 in both groups (94 % and 82 % of all IgG <b>antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibodies,</b> respectively), with a similar distribution of IgG 2, IgG 3 and IgG 4 <b>antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibodies</b> between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibodies</b> are specific to the autoimmune liver diseases, particularly primary sclerosing cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis. Titres are highest in primary sclerosing cholangitis, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 49 % and specificity of 89 % at 1 : 50, making it a useful serological marker for this disease. The lack of correlation with any marker of activity and the association of <b>antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibody</b> with extent of biliary tract involvement suggest that <b>antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibodies</b> arises {{as a result of}} the disease or related process rather than being a cause of it. The detection of <b>antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibodies</b> in autoimmune hepatitis, together with a similar IgG subclass distribution of primary sclerosing cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis <b>antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibodies,</b> may reflect similar mechanisms of immune regulation and a possible overlap syndrome. Future identification of the antigens against which this <b>antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibody</b> are directed should help to clarify this point, as well as allowing the development of a more sensitive and specific serological test for diagnostic purposes...|$|R

40|$|Leukotriene B- 4 (LTB 4) mediates {{different}} inflammatory {{events such}} as neutrophil migration and pain. The present study addressed the mechanisms of LTB 4 -mediated joint inflammation-induced hypernociception. It was observed that zymosan-induced articular hypernociception and neutrophil migration were reduced dose-dependently by the pretreatment with MK 886 (1 - 9 mg/kg; LT synthesis inhibitor) {{as well as in}} 5 -lypoxygenase-deficient mice (5 LO(-/-)) or by the selective antagonist of the LTB 4 receptor (CP 105696; 3 mg/kg). Histological analysis showed reduced zymosan-induced articular inflammatory damage in 5 LO(-/-) mice. The hypernociceptive role of LTB 4 was confirmed further by the demonstration that joint injection of LTB 4 induces a dose (8. 3, 25, and 75 ng) -dependent articular hypernociception. Furthermore, zymosan induced an increase in joint LTB 4 production. Investigating the mechanism underlying LTB 4 mediation of zymosan-induced hypernociception, LTB 4 -induced hypernociception was reduced by indomethacin (5 mg/kg), MK 886 (3 mg/kg), celecoxib (10 mg/kg), <b>antineutrophil</b> <b>antibody</b> (100 mu g, two doses), and fucoidan (20 mg/kg) treatments as well as in 5 LO(-/-) mice. The production of LTB 4 induced by zymosan in the joint was reduced by the pretreatment with fucoidan or <b>antineutrophil</b> <b>antibody</b> as well as the production of PGE(2) induced by LTB 4. Therefore, besides reinforcing the role of endogenous LTB 4 as an important mediator of inflamed joint hypernociception, these results also suggested that the mechanism of LTB 4 -induced articular hypernociception depends on prostanoid and neutrophil recruitment. Furthermore, the results also demonstrated clearly that LTB 4 -induced hypernociception depends on the additional release of endogenous LTs. Concluding, targeting LTB 4 synthesis/action might constitute useful therapeutic approaches to inhibit articular inflammatory hypernociception...|$|E

40|$|Acute {{injuries}} of {{the kidney}} or lung each represent serious, complex clinical problems, and their combination drastically decreases patient survival. However, detailed understanding of interactions {{between these two}} organs is scarce. To evaluate this further, we used the folic acid (FA) and myohemoglobinuria models of acute kidney injury (AKI) together with Pseudomonas aeruginosa inhalation to study kidney–lung cross-talk in mice during acute kidney and lung injury. Subgroups of mice received <b>antineutrophil</b> <b>antibody</b> or platelet-depleting serum to assess the role of neutrophil and platelets, respectively. AKI by itself did not cause clinically relevant acute lung injury. Pneumonia was neutrophil dependent, whereas pneumonia-induced AKI was platelet dependent. AKI attenuated pulmonary neutrophil recruitment and worsened pneumonia. Mice with AKI had lower oxygen saturations and greater bacterial load than mice without. Neutrophils isolated from mice with FA-induced AKI also had impaired transmigration and F-actin polymerization in vitro.

Methods: All children referred for initial assessment of possible IBD were eligible. Patients with symptoms or signs (right-lower quadrant mass, perianal disease, or hematochezia) mandating a complete work-up for IBD were excluded. All enrolled patients underwent a clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and endoscopic evaluation including biopsy examinations. The immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA ASCA, IgG pANCA, FC, IP, and BWUS were tested in all patients at the initial assessment. Results: A final diagnosis of IBD was made in 27 patients: 17 Crohn disease and 10 ulcerative colitis. Eighteen children had other gastrointestinal diagnoses (8 functional bowel disorders, 5 food allergy-mediated diseases, 4 infectious enterocolitis, 1 familial Mediterranean fever). In patients with simultaneous abnormal values of FC, BWUS, and ASCA/pANCA, the estimated probability of having IBD was 99. 47 %. Patients with negative results on all tests had a 0. 69 % of probability of IBD. Conclusions: The incorporation of noninvasive diagnostic tests into the initial diagnostic approach may avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and facilitate clinical decision-making when the diagnosis of IBD in children is initially uncertain. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|E

To examine the influence of discreteness, we: (1) determined the relation between manual quantification reliability and discreteness, (2) analyzed the reliability between the manual and computer-assisted approaches, and (3) determined the relation between the reliability of the manual and computer approaches and discreteness. Sixty murine injured skeletal muscle sections were immunolabeled using the <b>antineutrophil</b> <b>antibody,</b> 7 / 4. Using computer-generated section images, an observer counted the number of cells on 2 different occasions (T 1 and T 2). Computer cell counts per section and discreteness per section (as indicated by the max pixel area per section) were determined. A moderate correlation was found for the relation between manual reliability and discreteness (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). The rankings of manual and computer counts were different (P 3 ̆c 0. 01), suggesting a lack of reliability between these approaches. The relation between the reliability of the manual and computer approaches and discreteness was moderately correlated (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Samples with a computer count 200 or more had a greater mean max pixel area than those with a count 3 ̆c 200 (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001). In conclusion, manual quantification may be more appropriate with samples with a leukocyte count 3 ̆c 200, because discreteness is higher within this cell count range. Alternatively, when samples consist of 200 or more cells and discreteness is low, then the approaches that account for discreteness should be utilized...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Increased {{epithelial}} permeability of the airspaces occurs commonly in {{the lungs}} of cigarette smokers. It {{is likely to be}} important in augmenting the inflammatory response in the airspaces and hence may have a role in the pathogenesis of emphysema. It has previously been shown that intratracheal instillation of cigarette smoke condensate induces increased epithelial permeability in vivo in rats and in vitro in epithelial cell monolayers, associated with a disturbance in the lung antioxidant, glutathione (GSH). The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the role of neutrophils, GSH, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in the increased epithelial permeability following intratracheal instillation of cigarette smoke condensate. METHODS: Epithelial permeability of the airspaces was measured in rat lungs as the passage of intratracheally instilled 125 -iodine labelled bovine serum albumin (BSA) into the blood. The permeability of a monolayer of human type II alveolar epithelial cells to 125 I-BSA was also measured. RESULTS: Cigarette smoke condensate produced a 59. 7 % increase in epithelial permeability over control values peaking six hours after instillation and returning to control values by 24 hours. Depletion of neutrophils and, to a lesser extent, macrophages by an intraperitoneal injection of <b>antineutrophil</b> <b>antibody</b> did not influence the increased epithelial permeability induced by cigarette smoke condensate. Although instillation of human recombinant TNF alpha produced an increase in epithelial permeability in the rat lung from 0. 62 (0. 61) % to 1. 27 (0. 08) %, only a trivial amount of TNF alpha was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in vivo or in culture medium from BAL leucocytes obtained from animals treated with cigarette smoke condensate (94. 9 (28. 8) units/ml). Furthermore, antiTNF antibody did not abolish the increased epithelial permeability produced by cigarette smoke condensate. The role of GSH was assessed by measuring the changes in both the reduced (GSH) and oxidised form (GSSG) in lung tissue and in BAL fluid. One hour after instillation of cigarette smoke condensate there was a marked fall in the GSH content in the lung (from 809. 8 (31. 8) to 501. 7 (40. 5) nmol/g) in association with increased GSSG levels (from 89. 8 (2. 7) to 148. 7 (48. 8) nmol/g). This was followed by a return of GSH levels to control values, with a concomitant decrease in GSSG levels six hours after instillation. GSH levels in BAL fluid fell dramatically following cigarette smoke condensate (from 2. 56 (0. 30) to 0. 31 (0. 21) nmol/ml) and this fall was sustained up to six hours after instillation of cigarette smoke condensate. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that neutrophils and TNF do not have a major role in the increased epithelial permeability induced by cigarette smoke condensate. However, the data support a role for the depletion of the antioxidant glutathione in the increased epithelial permeability caused by cigarette smoke condensate...|$|E

40|$|Perinuclear <b>antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibodies</b> (p-ANCA) {{directed}} against cytoplasmic proteins of neutrophils {{have been studied}} extensively in patients with systemic vasculitides. Recent data indicate that <b>antineutrophil</b> <b>antibodies</b> in sera from patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) or autoimmune liver disorders, currently called ‘atypical p-ANCA’, recognize a nuclear target antigen, rendering the term ‘ANCA’ inaccurate. Specific microscopic criteria to distinguish atypical p-ANCA from p-ANCA are lacking. We used planar and confocal laser scanning indirect immunofluorescence microscopy to examine the labelling characteristics of ethanol-, methanol- and formaldehyde-fixed neutrophils by <b>antineutrophil</b> <b>antibodies</b> in 153 serum samples from patients with IBD, autoimmune liver disorders, systemic vasculitides or healthy blood donors. On ethanol- or methanol-fixed neutrophils, multiple intranuclear fluorescent foci together with either a rim-like peripheral nuclear staining (‘type A’) or a combined cytoplasmic and peripheral nuclear staining (‘type B’) was noted exclusively with atypical p-ANCA in sera from patients with IBD or autoimmune liver disorders. Intranuclear foci, which probably corresponded to invaginations of the nuclear envelope, were not labelled by p-ANCA from patients with microscopic polyangiitis or cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) from patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. On formaldehyde-fixed neutrophils, atypical p-ANCA gave a fine rim-like staining of the nuclear periphery, whereas ANCA diffusely labelled the cytoplasm.

40|$|Although <b>antineutrophil</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{are thought}} to be {{involved}} in drug-induced neutropenia, neither the precise mechanisms nor the particular antigens on the neutrophil surface have yet been clarified. Recently, we examined a patient with Graves’ disease who developed <b>antineutrophil</b> cytoplasmic <b>antibodies</b> (ANCA) after propylthiouracil treatment and exhibited neutropenia. Because several target antigens of ANCA are expressed on the surface of neutrophils, it was suggested that ANCA might contribute to neutropenia. The patient’s serum bound specifically to neutrophils and HL- 60 cells differentiated into granulocytes, and lysed the HL- 60 cells via a complement-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, two representative ANCA antigens, proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase, significantly inhibited both the binding and cytotoxicity of the serum. Finally, tumour necrosis factor-α, which is known to up-regulate cell surface expression of several ANCA antigens, enhanced both the binding and cytotoxicity of the serum. These findings suggest that ANCA induced by propylthiouracil contributed to leucopenia through a complement-mediated mechanism...|$|R
