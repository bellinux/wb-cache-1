5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), {{as a part}} of its {{maintenance}} responsibilities, {{tracks the}} volume of traffic using its roadways.

In 2009, the department's measurements indicated that <b>a</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> M-82 west of Fremont had the peak volume for the highway at 16,532vehicles daily.

5|$|The first {{highway to}} bear the M-68 {{designation}} was located in the western Upper Peninsula. It ran north from Rockland to Ontonagon and then westerly toward Silver City in 1919. This roadway was redesignated by 1927 as <b>a</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> M-35.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> {{what is now}} SR11 was {{originally}} added to the state highway system in 1895 as a Blanchard Whatcom County line road. The highway became State Road6 in 1905 and was named Waterfront Road in 1907. The road was incorporated into the Pacific Highway in 1913 and U.S. Route99 (US99) in 1926. After an inland bypass was designated {{by the state to}} become US99 in 1931, Chuckanut Drive became U.S. Route99 Alternate. During the 1964 highway renumbering, the road became SR11. In 1987, SR11 was realigned through Bellingham, shifting its northern terminus south to Fairhaven.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{has been}} a county road since 1960, F-41 was a state highway in 1919 when the state {{trunkline}} highway system was formed. It was <b>a</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> the original M-10 that was replaced by US23 in 1926. Later changes to US23 shifted that road closer to Lake Huron, and the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) created two different routings for M-171 out of the former US23 routings in the area. The second of these highways has been designated F-41 since 1970.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} state's {{maintenance}} of M-117, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadway.

5|$|At {{the time}} the {{business}} loop was still under state control, it was maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as <b>a</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> the State Trunkline Highway System.

These volumes were expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on <b>a</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> roadway. In the department's last survey, conducted in 2004, there were 10,272vehicles per day using Washington Street between Lincoln Avenue and Front Street, the lowest traffic count for the trunkline. The highest volume was 19,036vehicles between McClellan and Lincoln Avenues, while the Front Street section received 16,309vehicles on an average day. The former business loop has not been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
