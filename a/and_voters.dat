5|$|In September, a poll {{conducted}} by the Goldwater campaign revealed that Johnson had a comfortable lead over him. Indeed, Goldwater's campaign was an uphill battle against an incumbent administration during a prosperous economy. In {{the wake of the}} death of John Kennedy, who had been leading in polls for reelection in 1964, there lingered the possibility that Johnson had the sympathy of the media <b>and</b> <b>voters.</b>|$|E

5|$|Philadelphians {{elected a}} seventeen-member city council in 1955, with ten members {{representing}} districts of the city, {{and the remaining}} seven being elected at-large. For the at-large seats, each political party could nominate five candidates, <b>and</b> <b>voters</b> could only vote for five, with the result being that the majority party could only take {{five of the seven}} seats, leaving two for the minority party. The Democrats' citywide dominance continued into the city council races, as they retained control of nine of ten districts and five of seven at-large seats.|$|E
5|$|The talk {{became more}} {{widespread}} during {{his junior year}} as McCoy was mentioned by several analysts <b>and</b> <b>voters</b> as a potential 2008 Heisman winner. McCoy was the unanimous front-runner in an October 20 poll of 10 Heisman voters conducted by the Rocky Mountain News. Tim Tebow, quarterback of the Florida Gators, had a vote as the 2007 winner. Seven games into the season he said that McCoy would have his vote {{at that point in}} the season.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{thirteen}} seats open for magistrate, a local court, {{the duties of}} which are now performed by the Philadelphia Municipal Court. In the magistrate races, each political party could nominate eight candidates, <b>and</b> <b>voters</b> could only vote for eight, with the result being that the majority party could only take eight of the thirteen seats, leaving five for the minority party. The Democrats took {{the maximum number of}} eight magistracies, with incumbents Vincent A. Dean and William Cibotti leading the ticket. Republicans were held to just the five slots allotted them, with incumbent Benjamin W. Schwartz taking the most votes of his party's nominees.|$|E

5|$|Under the new charter, Philadelphians {{elected a}} seventeen-member city council in 1951, with ten members {{representing}} districts of the city, {{and the remaining}} seven being elected at-large. By {{the rules of the}} limited voting system for the at-large seats, each political party could nominate five candidates <b>and</b> <b>voters</b> could only vote for five, with the result that the majority party could only take five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. The Democrats' citywide triumph continued into the city council races, as they took nine of ten districts and five of seven at-large seats.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Shepard ran for an at-large {{seat on the}} Philadelphia City Council. By {{the rules}} of the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each {{political}} party could nominate five candidates <b>and</b> <b>voters</b> could only vote for five, with the result being that the majority party could only take five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. Shepard won one of the five Democratic slots and was easily elected. On the council, he served as head of the public works committee. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Shepard initially opposed the change, but later voted in favor after party leaders promised him more black Democrats would get political appointments. The amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval but failed in a vote that April.|$|E
5|$|In August 1953 France {{agreed to}} cede control over {{judicial}} and interior affairs to Cambodia, and subsequently the defense ministry {{as well in}} October 1953. At {{the end of the}} month, Sihanouk went to Phnom Penh, where he declared Cambodia's independence from France on 9November 1953. In May 1954 Sihanouk sent two of his cabinet ministers, Nhiek Tioulong and Tep Phan, to represent Cambodia at the Geneva Conference. The agreements signed for Cambodia affirmed the country's independence and allowed it to seek military aid from any country without restrictions. At the same time, Sihanouk's relations with the governing Democrat party remained strained, as they were wary of his growing influence in politics. To counter Democrat opposition, Sihanouk held a national referendum to gauge public approval for his efforts to seek national independence. While the results showed 99.8percent approval, Australian historian Milton Osborne noted that open balloting was carried out <b>and</b> <b>voters</b> were cowed into casting an approval vote under police surveillance.|$|E

5|$|The {{restrictions}} against royalist candidates <b>and</b> <b>voters</b> {{were widely}} ignored, and the elections {{resulted in a}} House of Commons that was fairly evenly divided on political grounds between Royalists and Parliamentarians and on religious grounds between Anglicans and Presbyterians. The new so-called Convention Parliament assembled on 25 April 1660, and soon afterwards welcomed the Declaration of Breda, in which Charles promised lenience and tolerance. There would be liberty of conscience and Anglican church policy would not be harsh. He would not exile past enemies nor confiscate their wealth. There would be pardons for nearly all his opponents except the regicides. Above all, Charles promised to rule in cooperation with Parliament. The English Parliament resolved to proclaim Charles king and invite him to return, a message that reached Charles at Breda on 8 May 1660. In Ireland, a convention had been called earlier in the year, and had already declared for Charles. On 14 May, he was proclaimed king in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|While Sawyer {{was serving}} overseas, the reform {{coalition}} swept the Democrats into power in Philadelphia {{for the first}} time in 67 years. When he returned to Philadelphia, Clark asked him to run for an at-large seat on City Council in 1955. By the rules of the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each political party could nominate five candidates <b>and</b> <b>voters</b> could only choose five. The result was that the majority party could take only five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. Sawyer was elected to one such seat and served a single four-year term. In that position, he sponsored legislation to establish the city's One Percent for Fine Arts program, which required one percent of the cost of construction projects in Center City to be spent on public art. He also worked for the creation of a Police Review Board. City Council did not pass that bill, but Mayor James Tate later created the board through an executive order.|$|E
