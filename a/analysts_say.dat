5|$|In {{the late}} 2000s, India's growth reached 7.5%, which will double {{the average income}} in a decade. <b>Analysts</b> <b>say</b> that if India pushed more {{fundamental}} market reforms, it could sustain the rate and even reach the government's 2011 target of 10%. States have large responsibilities over their economies. The average annual growth rates (2007-12) for Uttarakhand (13.66%), Bihar (10.15%) or Jharkhand (9.85%) were higher than for West Bengal (6.24%), Maharashtra (7.84%), Odisha (7.05%), Punjab (6.85%) or Assam (5.88%). India is the sixth-largest {{economy in the world}} and the third largest by purchasing power parity adjusted exchange rates (PPP). On per capita basis, it ranks 140th in the world or 129th by PPP.|$|E

A Navy {{project was}} given to Euromarine, a company {{associated}} with Anura Pereira, the tender awarded {{in a process that}} has been criticised as irregular. The tender was worth Sh4.1 billion. Military <b>analysts</b> <b>say</b> a similar vessel could have been built for Sh1.8 billion.|$|E
25|$|But {{whether the}} effort will succeed {{is far from}} certain, and some <b>analysts</b> <b>say</b> there are risks to that course, chief among them the {{possibility}} of further fueling the internal Palestinian conflict, leading to deeper despair {{in the occupied territories}} and a PA less able to make the compromises on peace with Israel than it is today.|$|E
2500|$|State {{news agency}} Bernama quoted several {{political}} <b>analysts</b> <b>saying</b> that the rally will tarnish Malaysia's image abroad {{and is a}} distraction from Anwar Ibrahim's ongoing sodomy trials. It claimed the 1998 demonstrations against Anwar's arrest and the 2007 Bersih rally caused [...] "inconvenience {{to the public and}} damage to public property, attracting bad publicity from the international media." [...] One analyst said elections are [...] "already fair as fair can be." [...] Bernama also reported <b>analysts</b> <b>saying</b> that Ambiga has a history of provoking Muslims and working against interests of the Malay community.|$|R

25|$|Beirut's foreign {{reserves}} {{were still}} {{close to an}} all-time high when they reached $32.5 billion in 2011 and <b>analysts</b> <b>say</b> that the Central Bank can cover nearly 80 percent of the Lebanese currency in the market. This means that the Central Bank can easily cope with any unforeseen crisis in the future thanks to the massive foreign currency reserves.|$|E
25|$|<b>Analysts</b> <b>say</b> that Lazcano's death {{does not}} signify {{the end of}} Los Zetas. As seen in other {{instances}} when top cartel leaders are taken out, fragmenting within the organizations occur, causing short-term violence. Los Zetas have a line of succession when leaders are arrested or killed, {{but the problem is}} that most of these replacements are younger, less-experienced members who are likely to resort to violence to maintain their reputation.|$|E
25|$|According to the Government of India Home Ministry, 2008 was {{the year}} with the lowest {{civilian}} casualties in 20 years, with 89 deaths, compared {{to a high of}} 1,413 in 1996. In 2008, 85 security personnel died compared to 613 in 2001, while 102 militants were killed. The human rights situation improved, with only one custodial death, and no custodial disappearances. Many <b>analysts</b> <b>say</b> Pakistan's preoccupation with jihadis within its own borders explains the relative calm.|$|E

50|$|OPEC's {{success has}} long been a matter of debate, with many <b>analysts</b> <b>saying</b> that the {{marketplace}} and the willingness of one country, Saudi Arabia, to limit output have been the deciding factors in determining oil prices. The oil embargo of 1973 was initiated just by the Arab producers, not OPEC as a whole.|$|R
5000|$|Business Insider {{reported}} {{that a variety of}} factors made it more likely that Iran's stance would harden once the agreement was in place, with one Iran expert saying that Iran's [...] "nice, smiling face" [...] would now disappear as the country pursued more adversarial stances, and policy <b>analysts</b> <b>saying</b> that by negotiating the deal with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, Obama had [...] "made an investment in the stability of the IRGC regime".|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} law {{enforcement}} and military agencies have adopted the 5.7×28mm cartridge. These agencies include the Navy SEALs and the Federal Protective Service branch of the ICE. In contrast, some defense contractors, law enforcement analysts, and military <b>analysts</b> <b>say</b> that hydrostatic shock is an unimportant factor when selecting cartridges for a particular use because any incapacitating effect it may have on a target is difficult to measure and inconsistent from one individual to the next. This {{is in contrast to}} factors such as proper shot placement and massive blood loss which are almost always eventually incapacitating for nearly every individual.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, western oil experts {{estimate}} that Russia's seizing of Crimea, and the associated control of an area of Black Sea {{more than three times}} its land area gives it access to oil and gas reserves potentially worth trillions of dollars. It also deprives Ukraine of its chances of energy independence. Most immediately however, <b>analysts</b> <b>say,</b> Moscow's acquisition may alter the route along which the South Stream pipeline would be built, saving Russia money, time and engineering challenges. It would also allow Russia to avoid building in Turkish territorial waters, which was necessary in the original route to avoid Ukrainian territory.|$|E
25|$|Bangladesh is {{a unitary}} state and {{parliamentary}} democracy. Bangladesh also {{stands out as}} one of the few Muslim-majority democracies. “It is a moderate and generally secular and tolerant — though sometimes this is getting stretched at the moment — alternative to violent extremism in a very troubled part of the world”, said Dan Mozena, the U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh. Although Bangladesh's legal code is secular, more citizens are embracing a conservative version of Islam, with some pushing for sharia law, <b>analysts</b> <b>say.</b> Experts say that the rise in conservatism reflects the influence of foreign-financed Islamic charities and the more austere version of Islam brought home by migrant workers in Persian Gulf countries.|$|E
50|$|The {{campaign}} at {{six weeks}} {{was the longest}} ever in Bermuda and was seen as being very bitter. Polls showed the election was tight with <b>analysts</b> <b>saying</b> that they expected the result to be close. During the campaign there was an incident when someone attempted to mail a bullet to the premier, Ewart Brown, but it was intercepted by a postal worker, which led both parties to try to calm the campaign down.|$|R

On September 22, 2014, Arboleda was traded to NLEX along with 2nd round picks for the 2016 and 2018 drafts for the rights of Matt Ganuelas-Rosser.|$|R
5000|$|Robin Abcarian for the Los Angeles Times criticized this {{reporting}} style by {{a conservative}} <b>analyst,</b> <b>saying</b> that blame was shifted onto the federal government. Abcarian noted that Barrett explicitly stated {{he was seeking}} a black victim, and postulated {{that he may have}} been acting on this [...] "lazy narrative that black teens were randomly attacking white people". She criticized the statement by Rev. Sharpton and the conservative news sources who began supporting him after decades of opposition.|$|R
25|$|Although Muslims and Orthodox Christians lived {{together}} in Ethiopia for many centuries, complete religious freedom was formalized only in 1991. Many of the pre-existing issues – {{dominance of the}} state religion to 1974, seizure of the church properties by the Mengistu regime, 1974–91, state-sponsored persecution of non-Orthodox Christians, second-class citizenship accorded to Ethiopian Muslims, landownership problems and similar issues for non-Orthodox believers – have subsided for the most part. There are currently between 12 and 15 million Protestant Christians, {{as well as other}} new non-Orthodox Christians. Clashes have been very rare with the domination of the Orthodox. Most <b>analysts</b> <b>say</b> that since such equality and full religious freedom didn't exist before, the infrequent clashes might occur until the culture of tolerance grows between all old and new religions and denominations.|$|E
25|$|In a 'Letter to American People' {{written by}} Osama bin Laden in 2002, {{he stated that}} one of the reasons he was {{fighting}} America was because of its support for India on the Kashmir issue. While on a trip to Delhi in 2002, US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld suggested that Al-Qaeda was active in Kashmir, though he did not have any hard evidence. An investigation by a Christian Science Monitor reporter in 2002 claimed to have unearthed evidence that Al-Qaeda and its affiliates were prospering in Pakistan-administered Kashmir with tacit approval of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI). In 2002, a team comprising Special Air Service and Delta Force personnel was sent into Indian-administered Kashmir to hunt for Osama bin Laden after reports that he was being sheltered by the Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. US officials believed that Al-Qaeda was helping organise a campaign of terror in Kashmir to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan. Their strategy was to force Pakistan to move its troops to the border with India, thereby relieving pressure on Al-Qaeda elements hiding in northwestern Pakistan. US intelligence <b>analysts</b> <b>say</b> Al-Qaeda and Taliban operatives in Pakistan-administered Kashmir are helping terrorists trained in Afghanistan to infiltrate Indian-administered Kashmir. Fazlur Rehman Khalil, the leader of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, signed al-Qaeda's 1998 declaration of holy war, which called on Muslims to attack all Americans and their allies. In 2006 Al-Qaeda claim they have established a wing in Kashmir, which worried the Indian government. Indian Army Lieutenant General H.S. Panag, GOC-in-C Northern Command, told reporters that the army has ruled out the presence of Al-Qaeda in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. He said that there no evidence to verify media reports of an Al-Qaeda presence in the state. He ruled out Al-Qaeda ties with the militant groups in Kashmir including Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. However, he stated that they had information about Al Qaeda's strong ties with Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed operations in Pakistan. While on a visit to Pakistan in January 2010, US Defense secretary Robert Gates stated that Al-Qaeda was seeking to destabilise the region and planning to provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.|$|E
500|$|The {{self-immolation}} {{incident was}} given prominent {{coverage in the}} official Chinese media, which <b>analysts</b> <b>say</b> took a propagandistic line. According to Philip Pan, the Communist Party [...] "launched an all-out campaign to use the incident to prove its claim that Falun Gong is a dangerous cult, and to turn public opinion in China and abroad against the group... Every morning and night, the state-controlled media carry fresh attacks against Falun Gong and its U.S.-based leader, Li Hongzhi." [...] Posters, leaflets and videos were produced, detailing the supposed detrimental effects of Falun Gong practice. The New York Times reported that the public was [...] "bombarded with graphic images of the act {{on television and in}} newspapers." [...] In China's schools, regular anti-Falun Gong classes were scheduled. Eight million students joined the [...] "Anti-Cult Action by the Youth Civilized Communities Across the Nation".

Disney ended their offerings 23 days after the program started, citing falling interest rates as a reason for terminating the ZEBRA program.|$|R

The militias soon re-captured several strategic positions such as Savur-Mohyla and Luhansk International Airport.

On February 26, 2009, Scripps announced that the Rocky Mountain News would print its final edition the next day, and that the newspaper's masthead, archives, and web site would be offered for sale, separate from its interest in the newspaper agency.|$|R
