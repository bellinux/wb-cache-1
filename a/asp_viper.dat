We genotyped 102 specimens from the whole Italian distribution range at three mitochondrial DNA regions (2278 characters, total) and six microsatellite DNA loci (Short Tandem Repeats, STR). The molecular phylogeny was constructed according to Bayesian, Neighbour Joining, Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood procedures. All methods grouped individuals of the three morphological subspecies (V. a. aspis, V. a. francisciredi, V. a. hugyi) into five different haploclades. Specimens assigned to hugyi clustered in two highly differentiated clades, one being sister group to the complex comprising the second clade of hugyi (i. e., a paraphyletic status), plus two clades of francisciredi. The Bayesian clustering of the STR variability disclosed only two groups, the first including aspis and francisciredi, the second all hugyi. Introgressive hybridization and capture of francisciredi-like lineages in the hugyi mitochondrial genome were suggested to explain the discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear data. The phylogeographic pattern was compatible with population contractions in three glacial refuges. Plausibility of derived hypothesis was checked using coalescence simulations as post hoc tests.

40|$|Colour {{polymorphism}} {{is widespread}} among vertebrates and plays {{important roles in}} prey–predator interactions, thermoregulation, social competition, and sexual selection. However, the genetic mechanisms involved in colour variation have been studied mainly in domestic mammals and birds, whereas information on wild animals remains scarce. Interestingly, the pro-opiomelanocortin gene (POMC) gives rise to melanocortin hormones that trigger melanogenesis (by binding the melanocortin- 1 -receptor; Mc 1 r) and other physiological and behavioural functions (by binding the melanocortin receptors Mc 1 - 5 rs). Owing to its pleiotropic effect, the POMC gene could therefore account for the numerous covariations between pigmentation and other phenotypic traits. We screened the POMC and Mc 1 r genes in 107 wild <b>asp</b> <b>vipers</b> (Vipera aspis) that can exhibit four discrete colour morphs (two unpatterned morphs: concolor or melanistic; two patterned morphs: blotched or lined) in a single population. Our study revealed a correlation between a single nucleotide polymorphism situated within the 3 ′-untranslated region of the POMC gene and colour variation, whereas Mc 1 r was {{not found to be}} polymorphic. To the best of our knowledge, we disclose {{for the first time a}} relationship between a mutation at the POMC gene and coloration in a wild animal, as well as a correlation between a genetic marker and coloration in a snake species. Interestingly, similar mutations within the POMC 3 ′-untranslated region are linked to human obesity and alcohol and drug dependence. Combined with our results, this suggests that the 3 ′-untranslated region of the POMC gene may play a role in its regulation in distant vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{occurrence}} {{of variation in}} body size and reproductive traits of Vipera aspis was assessed by analysing 74 reproductive females of different populations, collected throughout {{a large part of}} the distribution range of the taxon, from central-western France to central Italy. Six populations were analysed, two of plain habitats, in France and Italy, characterized by a Continental climate, whereas the other four derived from two coastal and two inland, hilly Italian habitats, respectively, showing a Mediterranean climate. Females of the French area showed the smallest mean body size, whereas the pre- and post-partum body masses of females from the coolest, central Italic area were significantly higher. Litter size varied among habitats and was significantly correlated with maternal body size. If the snout–vent length feature varied largely among offspring of different habitats (with the longest size occurring in representatives of the coastal, central Italian area), the average of both body mass and total mass of offsprings did not exhibit any clear pattern among populations colonizing different habitats. Nevertheless, relative litter mass was higher in the French continental populations, and lower in the coolest, Mediterranean, Italian ones. It is worth emphasizing the positive correlation between the snout–vent length feature of females and the total litter mass to environmental factors, such as hottest month temperature and total rainfall. The available literature records that female body size affects offspring size and fecundity. If the present study bolsters this correlation, it also rules out any other effect of female body size on the offspring characteristics analysed. Finally, evidence is provided for the role of climatic factors on life-history traits (e. g. pre-partum body mass) of <b>asp</b> <b>vipers,</b> although confounding effects pursued, for example, by food availability may occur...|$|R
50|$|The European polecat's diet {{consists}} of mouse-like rodents, followed by amphibians and birds. Its most frequent prey {{item in the}} former Soviet Union is the common vole and rarely the red-backed vole. In large river floodlands, water vole are common prey. In spring and winter, amphibians (especially grass frogs and green toads) become important food items. Selective predation on male frogs by the polecat decreases the occurrence of polyandry in frog populations. However, because amphibians have little calorific value, the polecat never grows fat on them, {{no matter how many}} it consumes. In Central Europe, the diet in winter months is dominated by birds including quail, grey partridges, grouse, chickens, pigeons and passerines. Seasonal changes in the activity rhythm is synchronised with the activity of the main prey. Some species only rarely preyed upon by the polecat include European hedgehogs, <b>asp</b> <b>vipers,</b> grass snakes and insects. In the British Isles, it commonly kills brown rats and European rabbits, and is capable of killing larger prey, such as geese and hares. One polecat was reported to frequently wait at a riverbank and catch eels, which it took back to its burrow. The polecat feeds on eels mostly during lengthy frosts when eels, unable to breathe air at regular intervals because of the ice, congregate at breathing holes. Unlike the stoat and weasel, the polecat readily eats carrion, including that of large ungulates. The European polecat hunts its prey by stalking it and seizing it with its canine teeth, killing the animal with a bite to the neck. This killing method is instinctive, but perfected with practice. The polecat sometimes caches its food, particularly during seasonal gluts of frogs and toads. Sometimes, the polecat does not kill these, but bites them {{at the base of the}} skull, thus paralyzing them and keeping them fresh for later consumption. Though they are normally shy around humans, naturalist Alfred Brehm in his Brehms Tierleben mentions an exceptional case in which three polecats attacked a baby in Hesse. During the winter period, when live prey is scarce, the European polecat may raid beehives and feed on the honey.|$|R

Discriminant Analysis on external features indicated the complete separation of V. aspis atra, V. aspis hugyi and V. aspis zinnikeri and the almost complete overlap of V. aspis aspis and V. aspis francisciredi.

40|$|The {{coloration}} of ectotherms {{plays an}} important role in thermoregulation processes. Dark individuals should heat up faster and be able to reach a higher body temperature than light individuals and should therefore have benefits in cool areas. In central Europe, montane local populations of adder (Vipera berus) and <b>asp</b> <b>viper</b> (Vipera aspis) exhibit a varying proportion of melanistic individuals. We tested whether the presence of melanistic V. aspis and V. berus could be explained by climatic conditions. We measured the climatic niche position and breadth of monomorphic (including strictly patterned individuals) and polymorphic local populations, calculated their niche overlap and tested for niche equivalency and similarity. In accordance with expectations, niche overlap between polymorphic local populations of both species is high, and even higher than that of polymorphic versus monomorphic montane local populations of V. aspis, suggesting a predominant role of melanism in determining the niche of ectothermic vertebrates. However, unexpectedly, the niche of polymorphic local populations of both species is narrower than that of monomorphic ones, indicating that colour polymorphism does not always enable the exploitation of a greater variability of resources, at least at the intraspecific level. Overall, our results suggest that melanism might be present only when the thermoregulatory benefit is higher than the cost of predation...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{studies on}} mammals and birds {{have shown that}} the effects of climate {{variation}} on population dynamics often depend on population composition, because weather affects different subsets of a population differently. It is presently unknown whether this is also true for ectothermic animals such as reptiles. Here we show such an interaction between weather and demography for an ectothermic vertebrate by examining patterns of survival and reproduction in six populations of a threatened European snake, the <b>asp</b> <b>viper</b> (Vipera aspis), over six to 17 years. Survival was lowest among juvenile and highest among adult snakes. The estimated annual probability for females to become gravid ranged from 26 % to 60 %, and was independent of whether females had reproduced in the year before or not. Variation in juvenile survival was strongly affected by winter temperature, whereas adult survival was unaffected by winter harshness. A matrix population model showed that winter weather affected population dynamics predominantly through variation in juvenile survival, although the sensitivity of the population growth rate to juvenile survival was lower than to adult survival. This study on ectothermic vipers revealed very similar patterns to those found in long-lived endothermic birds and mammals. Our results thus show that climate and life history can interact in similar ways across biologically very different vertebrate species, and suggest that these patterns may be very general...|$|E

Besides, rare atypical uniformly colored individuals are known here and there. Nevertheless, we found in a restricted treeless area of the French Alps, a population containing a high proportion (> 50 %) of such specimens. The aim of the study is to bring insight into the presence and function of this color morph by (i) studying the genetic structure of these populations using nine microsatellite markers, and testing for (ii) a potential local diversifying selection and (iii) differences in dispersal capacity between blotched and non-blotched vipers. RESULTS: Our genetic analyses support the occurrence of local diversifying selection for the non-blotched phenotype. In addition, we found significant color-biased dispersal, blotched individuals dispersing more than atypical individuals. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that, in this population, the non-blotched phenotype possess an advantage over the typical one, a phenomenon possibly due to a better background matching ability in a more open habitat. In addition, color-biased dispersal might be partly associated with the observed local diversifying selection, as it can affect the genetic structure of populations, and hence the distribution of color morphs...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the dietary changes which have intervened {{over the years in}} generalist and opportunist predators may provide useful {{information}} on the temporal modifications of their prey communities, especially under a climate change scenario. In this study, we analyzed the quantitative changes in the small mammals portion of the diet of two generalist and opportunist predators, the Barn owl (Tyto alba) and the <b>Asp</b> <b>viper</b> (Vipera aspis), in a forest zone in central Italy, for the period respectively 1987 - 2010 and 1975 - 2008. Concerning the Barn Owl, studied through the analysis of its pellets, there was no apparent change over the years, except for an increasing trend of syn-anthropic species Mus musculus domesticus and Rattus rattus. Similarly Microtus savii, a typical rodent of agroteriocoenoses, doesn’t show significant variations over the years. However, since I did not obtain a longitudinal long-term dataset on Barn owl pellets, I tested the methodology through a longitudinal sampling (for 30 years) at two Spanish areas. In this case it was possible to record a significant increase in two termoxerofilic species, Mus spretus and Crocidura russula, during the period analyzed. However, correlating this increase with thermopluviometric data for the same Iberian areas there wasn’t a significant correlation. As regards the analysis of the diet of the Viper, this issue was also studied through the analysis of ingesta, for a longitudinal period of 20 years. Among the various taxa eaten by vipers, only two showed significantly consistent trends over the years, with Myodes glareolus increasing and Sorex spp. declining in the viper diet. Despite being temperate-zone forest-associated species, hence likely adversed by global warming, Sorex spp. and Myodes glareolus showed opposite trends over the years, thus suggesting that such trends may reflect more local scale perturbations (local forest overgrowth and diminution of logging). I also found a significantly positive relationship between small mammals abundance in the field and their relative frequency of occurrence in the viper’s diet, thus demonstrating that vipers really sampled the small mammal species in relation to their local availability. However, global warming has certainly had an effect on the activity rhythms of predators: for example, some aspects of the annual phenology of the same populations of Viper studied for the diet have changed over the years according to patterns related to the global warming. This work therefore show the effectiveness of some indirect sampling methods in the study of temporal variations in small mammals highlighting some relevant limitations. We also tried to investigate the human impact through mutagenetic tests (micronucleus test on peripheral blood) and investigations in relation to bioaccumulation of trace elements in wild rodents. For this kind of analysis we made three different trapping sessions of small mammals in two areas: Canale Monterano and Civitavecchia. These areas are characterized by different conditions of anthropic impact: -	about Civitavecchia (Santagostino) we are in a mostly urbanized and man-made environment in relation with the presence of the largest european energy hub consisting of the Torvaldaliga power plants. -	about Canale Monterano there is a situation of greater naturalness, with agricultural areas, pastures and forest patches. With regard to the accumulation of trace elements analysis were conducted on the hair of small mammals captured and on the bones from barn owl’s pellets. The results show some significant differences for the two locations examined, in particular for the site of Canale Monterano readings are significantly higher in bone samples for the following elements Tl, Th and U due to the geology of the area, while, on the hair is confirmed a difference to Tl as well as a higher concentration of Pb in samples of Civitavecchia. This result is very interesting because it is directly attributable to the higher vehicular traffic and industrial pollution of Civitavecchia. The other important data concerne the concentrations of Mn, which could be due to use of fungicides in agriculture. With regard to micronucleus test, on erythrocytes from circulating blood, analysis showed a generalized genetic damage (from 0 to 8 MN in 1000 MNE) for both locations, according to the Mackey & MacGregor (1979) index used as reference (MNE/ 1000 ≥ 2), suggesting an alteration of the overall environmental situatio...|$|E
