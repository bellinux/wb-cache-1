5|$|Archbishop Robert excommunicated Palatine Denis and put Hungary {{under an}} interdict on 25 February 1232, because the {{employment}} of Jews <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> continued despite the Golden Bull of 1231.

Upon Andrew's demand, Pope Gregory sent Cardinal Giacomo Pecoraria as his legate to Hungary and promised that nobody would be excommunicated without the pope's special authorization. Although Andrew departed for Halych to support his youngest son in a fight against Daniel Romanivich, he continued his negotiations with the papal legate. On 20 August 1233, in the forests of Bereg, he vowed {{that he would not}} employ Jews <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> to administrate royal revenues, and would pay 10,000 marks as compensation for usurped Church revenues.
