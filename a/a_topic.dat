40|$|Automatic term {{extraction}} (ATE) aims at extracting domain-specific terms from a {{corpus of}} a certain domain. Termhood is one essential measure for judging whether a phrase is a term. Previous researches on termhood mainly depend on the word frequency information. In this paper, we propose to compute termhood based on semantic representation of words. <b>A</b> novel <b>topic</b> model, namely i-SWB, is developed to map the domain corpus into a latent semantic space, which is composed of some general <b>topics,</b> <b>a</b> background <b>topic</b> and <b>a</b> documents-specific <b>topic.</b> Experiments on four domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art ATE approaches.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal Swamp. Most settled on mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the swamp. Inhabitants included slaves who had purchased their freedom as well as escaped slaves.

Some slaves lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence slaves actually enjoyed there has been <b>a</b> <b>topic</b> of much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive nature of escaped slaves who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E

However, if Nakamura had a specific theme, she created several jokes and then connected them to form a story. When creating a simpler chapter as compared to the more elaborate, thematic ones, she wrote without worrying about creating jokes and situations in advance. With the help of her four assistants, on average she took between ten days and two weeks to make a complete chapter.|$|E
