5|$|According to CP+B {{employee}} Tom Zukoszki, {{the fictional}} background {{information for the}} band was that they signed with Burger King instead of a major record label. As part of the promotion, a four-song LP record was recorded, two music videos produced, and a national (US) tour planned. The tour had to be cancelled because the actor playing the lead singer, a Canadian citizen, was unable to enter the United States because he had <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> in his home country.|$|E
5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> may simply withhold that information from fear of being judged by whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Raël {{appeared}} on Ciel mon Mardi, a French talk show hosted by journalist Christophe Dechavanne. Toward {{the end of}} the show, Raël's liberal views on sex were critiqued by a priest, a social worker, and a psychologist. A former Raëlian named Jean Parraga believed that his wife and children were being held as prisoners and that Raël attempted to break up his family. He thought they were being treated like criminals in activities such as orgies and sacrifice involving children at the Sensual Meditation camp. Parraga also had <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> as a drug dealer and car thief, and in August 1992, he attempted to shoot Raël.|$|E

5|$|In {{the week}} {{where the first}} series of Red or Black? aired, ITV gained a much larger {{audience}} share than {{it had in the}} week directly previous, where it had been beaten by BBC One on six out of seven nights. Despite this, reviews of the first series were universally negative, and additional criticism was leveled at the show when it was discovered that Nathan Hageman, the first winner of the £1m prize, had <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>record.</b> The Sun began a campaign calling for Hageman to return the money, but he was eventually allowed to keep it. It did, however, lead to ITV dropping three other contestants from the show, with at least one withdrawn because of their criminal record.

5|$|The only clue {{found at}} the scene is a Lucky Boy {{employee}} button.

Scully suspects Spinks after it is discovered he has <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>record.</b> Mulder, however, believes that the victim's brain was removed by a proboscis, and suspects another employee, Rob Roberts, of committing the murder. Rob, who is actually a mutant human who wears a disguise to hide his true physical body, subsists on brains in order to survive. When Rob's landlady, Sylvia Jassey, is trailed by a private investigator (Steve Kiziak), Rob kills him and eats in order to placate his hunger, which begins to get more and more uncontrollable.|$|E
5|$|After {{a four-month}} investigation, the {{criminal}} justice branch of the Attorney General of British Columbia announced formal charges of assault causing bodily harm against Bertuzzi on June 24, 2004. With the charge, Bertuzzi faced up to one-and-a-half years in prison. Bertuzzi pleaded guilty to the assault charge on December 22 after arranging a plea bargain with prosecutors. He was given a conditional discharge requiring 80 {{hours of community service}} and one year's probation that additionally prohibited him from playing in any hockey game Moore was competing in. Under Canadian law, Bertuzzi's successful completion of his probationary period precluded him from <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>record.</b> Moore expressed disappointment regarding Bertuzzi's discharge and was upset that he was unable to attend the court date, having to issue a written victim statement instead. Moore's lawyer, Tim Danson, was given one day's notice of the court date following Bertuzzi's plea bargain, which he said was insufficient time for Moore to travel to Vancouver.|$|E
