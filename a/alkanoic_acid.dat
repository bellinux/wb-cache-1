40|$|Naphthenic acids (NAs) occur {{naturally}} in oil sands {{and enter the}} environment through natural and anthropogenic processes. NAs comprise toxic carboxylic acids {{that are difficult to}} degrade. Information on NA biodegradation mechanisms is limited, and there are no studies on alkyl branched aromatic <b>alkanoic</b> <b>acid</b> biodegradation, despite their contribution to NA toxicity and recalcitrance. Increased alkyl side chain branching has been proposed to explain NA recalcitrance. Using soil enrichments, we examined the biodegradation of four aromatic <b>alkanoic</b> <b>acid</b> isomers that differed in alkyl side chain branching: (4 ′-n-butylphenyl) - 4 -butanoic acid (n-BPBA, least branched); (4 ′-iso-butylphenyl) - 4 -butanoic acid (iso-BPBA); (4 ′-sec- butylphenyl) - 4 -butanoic acid (sec-BPBA) and (4 ′-tert-butylphenyl) - 4 - butanoic acid (tert-BPBA, most branched). n-BPBA was completely metabolized within 49 days. Mass spectral analysis confirmed that the more branched isomers iso-, sec- and tert-BPBA were transformed to their butylphenylethanoic acid (BPEA) counterparts at 14 days. The BPEA metabolites were generally less toxic than BPBA s as determined by Microtox assay. n-BPEA was further transformed to a diacid, showing that carboxylation of the alkyl side chain occurred. In each case, biodegradation of the carboxyl side chain proceeded through beta-oxidation, which depended on the degree of alkyl side chain branching, and a BPBA degradation pathway is proposed. Comparison of 16 S rRNA gene sequences at days 0 and 49 showed an increase and high abundance at day 49 of Pseudomonas (sec-BPBA), Burkholderia (n-, iso-, tert-BPBA) and Sphingomonas (n-, sec-BPBA). © 2011 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved...|$|E

FadD is inhibited noncompetitively by both acrylic acid and 2 -bromooctanoic acid. The deletion of the fadD gene from P. putida CA- 3 resulted in no detectable growth or polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) accumulation with 10 -phenyl-decanoic acid, decanoic acid, and longer-chain substrates.

The PHA accumulated by CA- 3 fadD contained a greater proportion of short-chain monomers than did wild-type PHA. Growth of CA- 3 fadD was unaffected, but PHA accumulation decreased modestly with shorter-chain sub-strates. The complemented mutant regained 70 % to 90 % of the growth and PHA-accumulating ability of the wild-type strain depending on the substrate.
