30|$|As {{compared}} to the PCL-gelatin films, the PCL-g-P(GMA)-c-gelatin films had a higher amount of immobilized gelatin, since gelatin was directly coupled to the pendant epoxide group of the repeat unit of P(GMA) brushes, resulting in the immobilized gelatin appearing in a dispersed form among the grafted P(GMA) chains {{rather than in the}} formation of a continuous surface layer. The increase in cell <b>adhesion</b> <b>ratio</b> of the PCL-g-P(GMA) 2 -c-gelatin surface (3.79  ±  0.73  μg/cm 2) with respect to the PCL-g-P(GMA) 1 -c-gelatin surface (2.63  ±  0.52  μg/cm 2) suggests that the cell adhesion is positively correlated to the amount of immobilized gelatin.|$|E
30|$|The {{interaction}} of cells with different PCL substrates was investigated by seeding endothelial cells (ECs) onto the films for 24  h {{to determine the}} initial adhesion ratios. Gelatin-coated coverslips were used as a positive control. The results (Table  2) showed that the ECs had the least affinity for the pristine PCL film, since less than 50  % {{of the total number}} of cells initially seeded onto the film remained on the film after 24  h. Despite obvious changes in surface hydrophilicity and roughness achieved after aminolysis treatment and the grafting of P(GMA) brushes, no significant improvement in cell <b>adhesion</b> <b>ratio</b> was observed on the PCL-NH 2 and the P(GMA)-grafted surfaces, as compared to the pristine PCL surfaces, this suggests that other factors (e.g. biological cues) may be required for positive cell interaction. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that the gelatinized films (PCL-gelatin film) had a higher affinity for cells, as compared to the films that did not contain the bioactive components of gelatin. More evident improvement in cell adhesion was observed in the PCL-g-P(GMA) 1 -c-gelatin and PCL-g-P(GMA) 2 -c-gelatin surfaces (Table  2). In fact, the number of attached cells increased with increasing concentration of exposed gelatin on the PCL surface. As a result, the PCL-g-P(GMA) 2 -c-gelatin surface, which had the highest density of immobilized gelatin, exhibited the most significant increase in cell <b>adhesion</b> <b>ratio,</b> comparable to that of the gelatin-coated coverslips (positive controls).|$|E
40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} ambroxol on the biofilm viability and pristine adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa wild (PAO 1) and quorum sensing defective strain (QS, gene deletion of ∆lasI and ∆rhlI).

The number of colony was measured with agar plate, multifunction fluorometer {{was used to measure}} the fluorescence intensity of PAO 1 and QS strains at the bottom of 96 -well plate. The <b>adhesion</b> <b>ratio</b> (%) was calculated {{to determine the effects of}} ambroxol on bacterial biofilm adhesion. Results　Ambroxol treatment reduced the survival rate of the mutant strains compared to that of wild strain, even though the QS strain had increased the adhesion in the presence of ambroxol compared to that of wild strain (P< 0. 05).

Importantly, <b>adhesion</b> force <b>ratios</b> over membrane regions away from and above the nucleus coincided with the ratios between numbers of adhering bacteria over both regions.

Recently, field {{measurements}} of wheel squeal occurrences at a site in Australia showed an increasing possibility for a squeal event to occur as the relative humidity increases. To verify these results, a new method to measure the lateral and normal force simultaneously was developed on a test rig, so as to determine the friction-creep curves. To investigate the effect of relative humidity on squeal and friction creep curves, the relative humidity inside the acoustic enclosure of test rig was adjusted under controlled conditions of 50 %, 70 % and 90 %. The test rig results show that the lateral <b>adhesion</b> <b>ratio</b> decreases slightly with the increase of relative humidity and that squeal is more likely in high relative humidity. The modelling analysis shows that the critical creepage decreases with the increase of the relative humidity, which means negative damping occurs for lower angle of attack...|$|E

Lactobacilli isolated from the intestinal tract with efficiency adhesion were selected and studied in assay competitions with different Salmonella serotypes. The growth and lectin production of lactobacilli remained unchanged in several mixed and single culture studies. However, in mixed cultures, the inhibition (bacteriostatic) of viable bacteria of salmonella strains was observed. The <b>adhesion</b> <b>ratio</b> showed significant values for L. animalis, L. fermentum, S. Gallinarum and S. Pullorum.

This pilot study assessed the efficacy of a sprayable polyethylene glycol (PEG) barrier {{in the prevention of}} de novo adhesions. 16 patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecological surgery were randomly assigned by shuffled sealed envelopes to receive either the adhesion barrier or no adhesion prevention. Incidence and severity of adhesions were scored at eight sites in the pelvis and reassessed by second look laparoscopy. Adhesion prevention was considered successful if no de novo adhesion were found at second look laparoscopy. One patient was excluded before randomization. Nine patients were randomized to treatment and six patients to control group. De novo adhesions were found in 0 / 9 patients who received the PEG barrier compared to 4 / 6 without adhesion prevention (0 % vs. 67 %, P = 0. 01). Reduction in adhesion score was significantly greater in patients receiving PEG barrier (- 2. 6 vs. - 0. 06, P = 0. 03). Meta-analysis of three randomized trials demonstrated that PEG barrier reduces the incidence of <b>adhesions</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> [OR] = 0. 27; 95 % CI 0. 11 - 0. 67).

40|$|A {{nanoscale}} modification {{strategy that}} can incorporate chondroitin sulfate (CS) into the cross-linked porous gelatin materials {{has previously been}} proposed to give superior performance for designed corneal keratocyte scaffolds. The purpose of this work was to further investigate the influence of carbodiimide chemistry on the characteristics and biofunctionalities of gelatin/CS scaffolds treated with varying N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) / 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) molar ratios (0 - 1) at a constant EDC concentration of 10 mM. Results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and dimethylmethylene blue assays consistently indicated that when the NHS to EDC molar ratio exceeds a critical level (i. e., 0. 5), the efficiency of carbodiimide-mediated biomaterial modification is significantly reduced. With the optimum NHS/EDC molar ratio of 0. 5, chemical treatment could achieve relatively high CS content in the gelatin scaffolds, thereby enhancing the water content, glucose permeation, and fibronectin adsorption. Live/Dead assays and interleukin- 6 mRNA expression analyses demonstrated that all the test samples have good cytocompatibility without causing toxicity and inflammation. In the molar ratio range of NHS to EDC from 0 to 0. 5, the cell <b>adhesion</b> <b>ratio</b> and proliferation activity on the chemically modified samples significantly increased, which is attributed to the increasing CS content. Additionally, the materials with highest CS content (0. 143 ± 0. 007 nmol/ 10 mg scaffold) showed the greatest stimulatory effect on the biosynthetic activity of cultivated keratocytes. These findings suggest that a positive correlation is noticed between the NHS to EDC molar ratio and the CS content in the biopolymer matrices, thereby greatly affecting the corneal stromal cell growth...|$|E

Two hundred and thirty eight LAB, belonging to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides species, and isolated from Nocellara Etnea table olives, have been screened in this survey through an in vitro approach. A simulation of transit tolerance in the upper human gastrointestinal tract, together with autoaggregation and hydrophobicity, have been decisive in reducing the number of LAB to 17 promising probiotics. None of the selected strains showed intrinsic resistances towards a broad spectrum of antibiotics and were therefore accurately characterized on an undifferentiated and 3 D functional model of the human intestinal tract made up of H 4 - 1 epithelial cells.

PMNL adhesion to HUVEC monolayers was measured over a range of wall shear stresses estimated to be representative of flow conditions in the microcirculation. HUVEC monolayers were treated with interleukin- 1 (IL 1, 2 U/ml, 4 hours) preceding the experiment. At 2. 0 dynes/cm 2 wall shear stress, 371 ± 25. 8 PMNL/mm 2 (mean ± SEM) adhered to IL 1 -treated HUVEC and 28 ± 2. 9 PMNL/mm 2 adhered to control HUVEC after ten minutes of flow (p < 0. 01 on the <b>adhesion</b> <b>ratio,</b> n = 5).

Cat mesenteric and intestinal blood flows were reduced to 20 % of baseline for 1 hr, followed by 1 hr of reperfusion. Sixty minutes after reperfusion, red blood cell velocity (Vr), leukocyte rolling velocity (Vw), and the number of adherent leukocytes were measured in mesenteric venules. Then, either manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), catalase, desferriox-amine, or oxypurinol was administered intravascularly. Ten minutes later, repeat mea-surements were obtained and compared with pretreatment values. Catalase, Mn-SOD, and oxypurinol significantly attenuated neutrophil adherence while neither inactivated-cata-lase nor desferrioxamine altered the reperfusion-induced leukocyte <b>adhesion.</b> The <b>ratio</b> of Vw to erythrocyte velocity, an index of the fracture stress between rolling leukocytes and venular endothelium, was not altered by any of the agents studied.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Probiotic {{microorganisms}} favorably {{alter the}} intestinal microflora balance, promote intestinal integrity and mobility, inhibit {{the growth of}} harmful bacteria and increase resistance to infection. Probiotics are increasingly used in nutraceuticals, functional foods or in microbial interference treatment. However, the effectiveness of probiotic organism {{is considered to be}} population-specific due to variation in gut microflora, food habits and specific host-microbial interactions. Most of the probiotic strains available in the market are of western or European origin, and a strong need for exploring new indigenous probiotic organisms is felt. METHODS AND FINDINGS: An indigenous isolate Lp 9 identified as Lactobacillus plantarum by molecular-typing methods was studied extensively for its functional and probiotic attributes, viz., acid and bile salt tolerance, cell surface hydrophobicity, autoaggregation and Caco- 2 cell-binding as well as antibacterial and antioxidative activities. Lp 9 isolate could survive 2 h incubation at pH 1. 5 - 2. 0 and toxicity of 1. 5 - 2. 0 % oxgall bile. Lp 9 could deconjugate major bile salts like glycocholate and deoxytaurocholate, indicating its potential to cause hypocholesterolemia. The isolate exhibited cell-surface hydrophobicity of approximately 37 % and autoaggregation of approximately 31 %. Presence of putative probiotic marker genes like mucus-binding protein (mub), fibronectin-binding protein (fbp) and bile salt hydrolase (bsh) were confirmed by PCR. Presence of these genes suggested the possibility of specific interaction and colonization potential of Lp 9 isolate in the gut, which was also suggested by a good <b>adhesion</b> <b>ratio</b> of 7. 4 +/- 1. 3 % with Caco- 2 cell line. The isolate demonstrated higher free radical scavenging activity than standard probiotics L. johnsonii LA 1 and L. acidophilus LA 7. Lp 9 also exhibited antibacterial activity against E. coli, L. monocytogenes, S. typhi, S. aureus and B. cereus. CONCLUSION: The indigenous Lactobacillus plantarum Lp 9 exhibited high resistance against low pH and bile and possessed antibacterial, antioxidative and cholesterol lowering properties with a potential for exploitation in the development of indigenous functional food or nutraceuticals...|$|E
40|$|Moisture {{damage is}} one of the major {{problems}} of asphalt pavements in United States. The moisture damage problem in asphalt has been studied for decades; still it remains an unsolved problem. Traditional macro-scale tests and methods failed to describe how and what factors affect moisture damage because moisture damage in asphalt is related to asphalt chemistry and adhesion characteristics, which are below micron scale phenomena. To this end, asphalt chemistry and adhesion values are studied at nano-scale to understand moisture damage in this study. Nano-scale measurements are conducted using an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) in the laboratory. In an AFM test, adhesion forces of dry and wet asphalt samples are measured by probing the sample surface with AFM tips. Nano-scale pull-off force or adhesion between sample molecules and tip molecules are measured. To facilitate the study of asphalt chemistry, AFM tips are modified using chemical functional groups such as carboxyl (-COOH), hydroxyl (-OH), ammin (-NH 3) and methyl (-CH 3), representing the chemistry of asphalt binder. Thus functionalized tips facilitate the measurement of adhesion within the asphalt binder. In addition, silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) tips are used. Silicon nitride resembles aggregate molecules (e. g. silica aggregate) that are used to produce asphalt concrete or pavements. Thus adhesion value measured using a silicon nitride tip can be considered as the adhesion value of asphalt-aggregate interface. It is shown in this study that the adhesion within the asphalt binder varies depending on the chemistry of asphalt. AFM testing on asphalt is non-trivial and very challenging as AFM tips stick to the asphalt surface due to the viscous and soft nature of asphalt binder. AFM testing also requires smooth surface of a test sample. This study has developed a methodology for asphalt sample preparation for AFM testing. Simply, pouring asphalt binder on a glass substrate and melting to free flow and then cooling it generates an AFM asphalt sample with a root mean square surface roughness below 10 nm. Such sample surface is smooth enough for AFM testing. Through trial and error, this study has calibrated a set of AFM testing parameters that are suitable for successful adhesion measurement in asphalt binder. In all cases, a set of AFM samples are tested under dry condition, and a set of identical samples are tested after wet conditioning. Polymer is almost an essential component of asphalt binders now-a-days. However it is not known whether polymer modification helps reduce moisture damage potential of asphalt. Therefore, both base binder and polymer modified asphalt binder are characterized herein using AFM. Two common polymers Styrene-Butadyne (SB) and Styrene-Butadyne-Styrene (SBS) are used to modify the base asphalt. The goal is to examine whether polymer modification helps reduce moisture damage at nano-scale. In addition to polymer, a chemical modifier known as Elvaloy is included in this study to examine whether Elvaloy is more effective than polymer in regards to moisture damage. It is shown that both base and modified asphalt binders are vulnerable to moisture damage to some degree. However, base binder is the most susceptible to moisture damage among all the binders. It is evident that the SB polymer modification of asphalt is good for interface adhesion, whereas the SBS polymer modification is good for achieving higher adhesion within the asphalt binder. Antistripping agents are commonly used to reduce moisture damage potential of an asphalt binder. A number of antistripping agents are available in the market. However, it is not know which antistripping works better than others. To examine, five common antistripping agents such as lime, klingbeta, wetfix, morlife and unichem are considered for AFM testing in this study. It is evident from this study that moisture damage occurs in asphalt binder having an antistripping agent. Hydrated lime provides higher moisture damage resistance to asphalt binders that the liquid antistripping agents such as morlife, unichem, klingbeta, and wetfix. Statistical analysis of the adhesion test results is performed. Based on Pearson’s p-value (significance test), it is concluded that the adhesion value measure by an AFM varies with the type and amount of antistripping agent present in an asphalt sample. Finally, an attempt is made to correlate nano-scale adhesion value of an asphalt binder to macro-scale strength value representing moisture damage. Only polymer modified binders are considered for examining such correlations. Macro-scale indirect tension tests are conducted on wet and dry asphalt concrete samples. A good correlation exists between the macro-scale indirect tensile strength ratio, and nano-scale <b>adhesion</b> <b>ratio</b> of wet and dry samples.

40|$|Gecko feet {{stick to}} almost anything, {{in almost any}} {{condition}} (including underwater and in space), but do not stick unintentionally, do not stick to dirt, and enable the gecko to literally run up the walls. When climbing a smooth surface, geckos can attach and detach each foot very quickly (detaching a foot takes 15 milliseconds) and with almost no noticeable force, but if attached perfectly they could theoretically hold tens of times their body weight. In contrast to gecko adhesion, conventional adhesives, made of soft tacky materials, tend to leave residues, pick up dirt easily, stick to themselves strongly and are useless underwater. Gecko feet rely on completely different principles, utilizing arrays of tiny mechanical structures made of very stiff protein which react to pressing and dragging with some very smart behavior. This thesis work is primarily concerned with taking inspiration from the principles of gecko-adhesion {{in order to control}} the attachment of synthetic structured adhesives. We present gecko-inspired angled elastomer micropillars with flat or round tip endings as compliant pick-and-place micromanipulators. The pillars are 35 μm in diameter, 90 μm tall, and angled at an inclination of 20 °. By gently pressing the tip of a pillar to a part, the pillar adheres to it through intermolecular forces. Next, by retracting quickly, the part is picked from a given donor substrate. During transferring, the adhesion between the pillar and the part is high enough to withstand disturbances due to external forces or the weight of the part. During release of the part onto a receiver substrate, the contact area of the pillar to the part is drastically reduced by controlled vertical or shear displacement, which results in reduced adhesive forces. The maximum repeatable ratio of pick-to-release adhesive forces was measured as 39 to 1. We find that a flat tip shape and shear displacement control provide a higher pick-to-release <b>adhesion</b> <b>ratio</b> than a round tip and vertical displacement control, respectively. We present a model of forces to serve as a framework for the operation of this micromanipulator. Finally, demonstrations of pick-and-place manipulation of μm-scale silicon microplatelets and a cm-scale glass cover slip serve as proofs of concept. The compliant polymer micropillars are safe for use with fragile parts, and, due to exploiting intermolecular forces, could be effective on most materials and in air, vacuum, and liquid environments. We present a study of the self-cleaning and contamination resistance phenomena of synthetic gecko-inspired adhesives made from elastomeric polyurethane. The phenomenon of self-cleaning makes the adhesive foot of the gecko robust against dirt, and makes it effectively sticky throughout the lifetime of the material (within the molting cycles). So far synthetic gecko adhesives fail to capture this behavior and self-cleaning remains the least studied characteristic in the field geckoinspired adhesives. In this work we use two distinct arrays of micropillars with mushroom-shaped tips made from polyurethane. The two geometries we use all have the same aspect ratios of pillar height to base diameter of about 2 to 1, and all have mushroom tips that are twice the diameter of base. The pillar tip diameters are 20 μm and 95 μm, and we will refer to them as the small and large pillars, respectively. We contaminate the adhesives with simulated dirt particles in the form of well-characterized soda lime glass spheres ranging in diameter from 1 to 250 μm. Both micropillar arrays recovered adhesive strength after contamination and cleaning through dry, shearing contact with glass. In a best case scenario, we found that large pillars contaminated with 150 - 250 μm diameter particles can rid the tips of contaminating particles completely and recover 90 % of the initial adhesive strength. This finding is significant because it is the first demonstration of adhesion recovery through dry self-cleaning by contact to a non-sticky cleaning substrate. The degree to which adhesion is recovered is superior to any conventional adhesive and is nearly identical to the gecko itself. This thesis presents a study of controlling adhesion in gecko-inspired adhesives. This control is achieved by maximizing or minimizing attachment strength on demand by simple mechanical loading, and enables robotic manipulation tasks and the recovery of adhesion after contamination. Looking forward, we can predict what is possible for gecko-inspired adhesives if the discoveries in this thesis are implemented, and if other shortcomings in the field are resolved. Looking at the applications already under development, it seems clear that medical adhesives have great potential, and climbing robots might achieve significant utility. In consumer products, gecko-adhesives might replace Velcro®and zippers in clothing, and might become a critical component in sports gear, e. g. soccer goal keeper and rock climber gloves. The reversible, controllable nature of the adhesion, as well as its incredible bonding strength, suggests more impressive possibilities for gecko-inspired adhesives: perhaps it might act as a fastener for temporary or emergency construction. We might yet see rolls of single-sided and double-sided gecko-tape sold in hardware stores, not as a replacement for duct tape, but as a replacement for nails, staples and screws...|$|E

Additionally, its influence on the metastasis and recurrence of mouse hepatocellular carcinoma was measured. METHODS: The anti-adhesion effect of β 2 on the highly metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HCCLM 6 cells and fibronectin (FN) was assayed by the MTT assay. The inhibition of invasion of HCCLM 6 cells by β 2 was observed using a Transwell (modified Boyden chamber) and matrigel. Using the hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis model and LCI-D 20 nude mice, the influence of β 2 on the metastasis and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after early resection was investigated. RESULTS: HCCLM 6 cells co-incubated with 100 μmol/L, 50 μmol/L, 20 μmol/L or 10 μmol/L β 2 for 3 h showed an obvious decrease in adhesion to FN. The <b>adhesion</b> inhibition <b>ratios</b> were 11. 8 %, 21. 7 %, 29. 6 % and 48. 7 %, respectively. Additionally, HCCLM 6 cells cultured with 100 μmol/L β 2 had a dramatic decrease in cell invasion. β 2 was also observed to inhibit the incisal edge recurrence and the distant metastasis of nude mice hepatocellular carcinoma after early resection (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The β 2 peptide can specifically block the adhesion and invasion of HCCLM 6 cells, and can inhibit HCC recurrence and metastasis of LCI-D 20 model posthepatectomy in vivo. Thus, β 2 should be further studied as a new anti-tumor drug...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. When a brittle {{material}} is loaded by a blunt indenter a Hertzian cone crack may form in its surface. This crack weakens {{the material and}} can lead to material removal. In many practical situations a thin compliant coating may be applied either to deliberately reduce this type of damage or for some other reason (e. g. an anti-corrosion paint layer). This paper models abrasion and impact on the coated system by the contact of a rigid sphere. The results of simple analyses for the stresses within the coating are used to determine how the tensile stresses in the surface of the material, which would lead to Hertzian fracture {{in the absence of the}} coating, are modified by the presence of the coating. The two extreme cases of rigid and zero adhesion of the coating to the substrate are directly compared. It is found that the stresses are most sensitive to the coating <b>adhesion,</b> Poisson’s <b>ratio</b> and thickness while the modulus of the coating material is only of secondary importance. It is shown that for optimum protection by the coating, it should be rigidly adhering to the substrate, that i t should be nearly incompressible (Poisson’s ratio> 0. 4) and that the coating thickness should be approximately 20 % of the radius of the contact between the coating and the sphere. These criteria allow a protective coating to be designed using theoretical argu-ments rather than to be developed empirically.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} was developed using PDMS-substrates with surface-aligned nanotopography gradients, varying unidirectional in amplitude and wavelength, for studying cell behavior {{with regard to}} adhesion and alignment. The gradients target more surface feature parameters simultaneously and provide more information with fewer experiments and are therefore vastly superior with respect to individual topography substrates. Cellular adhesion experiments on non-gradient aligned nanowrinkled surfaces displayed a linear relationship of osteoblast cell adhesion with respect to topography aspect ratio. Additionally, an aspect ratio of 0. 25 {{was found to be}} most efficient for cell alignment. Modification of the surface preparation method allowed us to develop an approach for creating surface nanotopography gradients which innovatively provided a superior data collection with fewer experiments showing that 1) low amplitude with small wavenumber is best for osteoblast cell adhesion 2) indeed higher aspect ratios are favorable for alignment however only with features between 80 - 180 nm in amplitude and 450 - 750 nm in wavelength with a clear transition between adhesion and alignment efficiency and 3) disproved a linear relationship of cell <b>adhesion</b> towards aspect <b>ratio</b> as was found for single feature substrate analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The immune {{response}} {{in a patient}} with acute babesiosis was determined by measurements of lymphocyte subpopulations, serum levels of cytokines, and <b>adhesion</b> molecules. The <b>ratio</b> of CD 41 :CD 81 lymphocytes was reduced early in the infection, but returned to a normal value after treatment with azithromycin and quinine. Natural killer (NK) cells markedly increased in the acute phase but progressively decreased and to the normal range in the con-valescent phase. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-a, interferon-g, interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), IL- 6, E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1, and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 were highly elevated in the acute phase while normal levels of these mediators were observed one month after treatment. These results suggest that CD 81 T cells and NK cells {{may be involved in}} the host defense mechanisms against acute babesiosis. Human babesiosis is an uncommon disease in Asia. The clinical spectrum of babesial infection in humans is broad and ranges from asymptomatic carrier states to fulminant disease that results in rapid death. Acute babesiosis is a ma-laria-like infection, characterized by fever, hemolytic ane-mia, and hemoglobinuria. 1 Although the {{immune response}} to babesial infections has been studied in animal models...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to successfully deposit Titanium Ti- 6 Al- 4 V layers onto Ti- 6 Al- 4 V substrate using two new commercially available Cold Spray processes such as Low Pressure Cold Spray (LPCS) and Pulsed Gas Dynamic Spray (PGDS). The second {{objective of}} this work is to develop a technique to repair Titanium parts since there is currently no repair technique commercially available. It is envisioned that commercial cold spray systems could be used to repair gashes on Titanium components. The examination of both feedstock powders and coatings were performed by different techniques such as optical microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Porosity, hardness, <b>adhesion</b> strength, flattening <b>ratio,</b> wipe test, fracture surface, wear test, XRD and chemical composition of the coatings using EDS have been evaluated. Cold spray has shown to be a promising technique for the deposition of heat sensitive particles such as titanium. LPCS and PGDS both produced high quality coatings.

40|$|Placenta previa, one of {{the most}} severe obstetric complications, carries an {{increased}} risk of intraoperative massive hemorrhage. Several risk factors for intraoperative hemorrhage have been identified to date. However, the correlation between birth weight and intraoperative hemorrhage has not been investigated. Here we estimate the correlation between birth weight and the occurrence of intraoperative massive hemorrhage in placenta previa. We included all 256 singleton pregnancies delivered via cesarean section at our hospital because of placenta previa between 2003 and 2015. We calculated not only measured birth weights but also standard deviation values according to the Japanese standard growth curve to adjust for differences in gestational age. We assessed the correlation between birth weight and the occurrence of intraoperative massive hemorrhage (> 1500 mL blood loss). Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to determine the cutoff value of intraoperative massive hemorrhage. Of 256 pregnant women with placenta previa, 96 (38 %) developed intraoperative massive hemorrhage. Receiver-operating characteristic curves revealed that the area under the curve of the combination variables between the standard deviation of birth weight and intraoperative massive hemorrhage was 0. 71. The cutoff value with a sensitivity of 81. 3 % and specificity of 55. 6 % was - 0. 33 standard deviation. The multivariate analysis revealed that a standard deviation of >- 0. 33 (odds ratio, 5. 88; 95 % confidence interval, 3. 04 - 12. 00), need for hemostatic procedures (odds ratio, 3. 31; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 79 - 6. 25), and placental <b>adhesion</b> (odds <b>ratio,</b> 12. 68; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 85 - 92. 13) were independent risk of intraoperative massive hemorrhage. In patients with placenta previa, a birth weight >- 0. 33 standard deviation was a significant risk indicator of massive hemorrhage during cesarean section. Based on this result, further studies are required to investigate whether fetal weight estimated by ultrasonography can predict hemorrhage during cesarean section in patients with placental previa...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the association between image characteristics on preoperative chest CT and severe pleural adhesion during surgery in lung cancer patients. We included consecutive 124 patients who underwent lung cancer surgeries. Preoperative chest CT was retrospectively reviewed to assess pleural thickening or calcification, pulmonary calcified nodules, active pulmonary inflammation, extent of emphysema, interstitial pneumonitis, and bronchiectasis in the operated thorax. The extent of pleural thickening or calcification was visually estimated and categorized into two groups: localized and diffuse. We measured total size of pulmonary calcified nodules. The extent of emphysema, interstitial pneumonitis, and bronchiectasis was also evaluated with a visual scoring system. The occurrence of severe pleural adhesion during lung cancer surgery was retrospectively investigated from the electrical medical records. We performed logistic regression analysis to determine the association of image characteristic on chest CT with severe pleural adhesion. Localized pleural thickening was found in 8 patients (6. 5 %), localized pleural calcification in 8 (6. 5 %), pulmonary calcified nodules in 28 (22. 6 %), and active pulmonary inflammation in 22 (17. 7 %). There was no patient with diffuse pleural thickening or calcification in this study. Trivial, mild, and moderate emphysema was found in 31 (25. 0 %), 21 (16. 9 %), and 12 (9. 7 %) patients, respectively. Severe pleural adhesion was found in 31 (25. 0 %) patients. The association of localized pleural thickening or calcification on CT with severe pleural adhesion was not found (P = 0. 405 and 0. 107, respectively). Size of pulmonary calcified nodules and extent of emphysema were significant variables in a univariate analysis (P = 0. 045 and 0. 005, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, moderate emphysema was significantly associated with severe pleural <b>adhesion</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> of 11. 202, P = 0. 001). In conclusion, severe pleural adhesion might be found during lung cancer surgery, provided that preoperative chest CT shows substantial pulmonary calcified nodules or emphysema...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{viscoelasticity}} on adhesion was investigated for micropatterned epoxy surfaces and compared to nonpatterned surfaces. A two-component epoxy system {{was used to}} produce epoxy compositions with different viscoelastic properties. Pillar arrays with flat punch tip geometries were fabricated with a two-step soft lithography process. Adhesion properties were measured with a home-built adhesion tester using a spherical sapphire probe as a counter-surface. Compared to flat controls, micropatterned epoxy samples with low visco elasticity (i. e., low damping factors) showed at least a 20 -fold reduction in pull-off force per actual contact area for both low (E' = 2. 3 MPa) and high (E' = 2. 3 GPa) storage moduli. This antiadhesive behavior may result from poor contact formation and indicates that the adhesion performance of commonly used elastomers for dry adhesives (e. g., polydimethylsiloxane) is governed by the interfacial viscoelasticity. Adhesion significantly increased with increasing viscoelasticity. Micropatterned samples with high viscoelasticity showed a 4 -fold reduction in <b>adhesion</b> for aspect <b>ratio</b> (AR) 1. 1 patterns but a 2 -fold enhancement in adhesion for AR 2. 2 patterns. These results indicate that viscoelasticity can enhance the effect of surface patterning on adhesion and {{should be considered as}} a significant parameter in the design of artificial patterned adhesives...|$|R
40|$|Polyurethane {{adhesives}} {{made from}} synthetic chemicals are non-biodegradable, costly {{and difficult to}} find raw materials from local market. To avoid solid pollution problem, cost effectiveness and easy availability of raw materials, biomaterials based polyurethane adhesives are used in current industrial interest. Direct use of castor oil in polyurethane adhesive gives limited hardness. Modification on active sites of castor oil to utilize double bond of unsaturated fatty acid and carboxyl group yields new modified or activated polyols, which can be utilized for polyurethane adhesive formulation. In view of this, we have synthesized polyurethane adhesives from polyester polyols, castor oil based polyols and epoxy based polyols with Isocyanate adducts based on castor oil and trimethylolpropane. To {{study the effects of}} polyurethane adhesive strength (i. e. lap shear strength) on wood-to-wood and metal-to-metal bonding through various types of polyols, cross-linking density, isocyanate adducts and also to compare adhesive strength between wood to wood and metal to metal surface. These polyols and polyurethanes were characterized through GPC, NMR and IR-spectroscopy, gel and surface drying time. Thermal stability of PU adhesives was determined under the effect of cross-linking density (NCO/OH ratio). The NCO/OH ratio (1. 5) was optimized for adhesives as the higher NCO/OH ratio (2. 0) increasing cross-linking density and decreases <b>adhesion.</b> Lower NCO/OH <b>ratio</b> (1. 0) provideslow cross-linking density and low strength of adhesives...|$|R
40|$|Arterial {{stiffness}} predicts {{an increased}} risk of cardiovascular events. Inflammation {{plays a major role in}} large arteries stiffening, related to atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, smooth muscle cell migration, vascular calcification, increased activity of metalloproteinases, extracellular matrix degradation, oxidative stress, elastolysis, and degradation of collagen. The present paper reviews main mechanisms explaining the crosstalk between inflammation and arterial stiffness and the most common inflammatory markers associated with increased arterial stiffness, considering the most recent clinical and experimental studies. Diverse studies revealed significant correlations between the severity of arterial stiffness and inflammatory markers, such as white blood cell count, neutrophil/lymphocyte <b>ratio,</b> <b>adhesion</b> molecules, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, cytokines, microRNAs, and cyclooxygenase- 2, in patients with a broad variety of diseases, such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes, coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, malignant and rheumatic disorders, polycystic kidney disease, renal transplant, familial Mediterranean fever, and oral infections, and in women with preeclampsia or after menopause. There is strong evidence that inflammation plays an important and, at least, partly reversible role in the development of arterial stiffness, and inflammatory markers may be useful additional tools in the assessment of the cardiovascular risk in clinical practice. Combined assessment of arterial stiffness and inflammatory markers may improve non-invasive assessment of cardiovascular risk, enabling selection of high-risk patients for prophylactic treatment or more regular medical examination. Development of future destiffening therapies may target pro-inflammatory mechanisms...|$|R

By using responsive polymer chemistry and molecular self-assembly, adhesion at solid/liquid interfaces can be achieved and modulated by external stimuli. Here, we utilize thermosensitive polymeric materials based on random copolymers of di(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (MEO 2 MA) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (OEGMA), that is, P(MEO 2 MAx-co-OEGMAy), to investigate the role of hydrophobicity on the phenomenon of <b>adhesion.</b> The copolymer <b>ratio</b> (x/y) dictates macromolecular changes enabling control of the hydrophilic-to-lipophilic balance (HBL) of the polymer brushes through external triggers such as ionic strength and temperature. We discuss the HBL of the thermobrushes {{in terms of the}} surface energy of the substrate by measuring the contact angle at water-decane-P(MEO 2 MAx-co-OEGMAy) brush contact line as a function of polymer composition and temperature. Solid supported polyelectrolyte layers grafted with P(MEO 2 MAx-co-OEGMAy) display a transition in the wettability that is related to the lower critical solution temperature of the polymer brushes. Using experimental observation of the hydrophilic to hydrophobic transition by the contact angle, we extract the underlying energetics associated with liquid-liquid-solid adhesion {{as a function of the}} copolymer ratio. The change in cellular attachment on P(MEO 2 MAx-co-OEGMAy) substrates of variable (x/y) composition demonstrates the subtle role of compositional tuning on the ability to control liquid liquid solid adhesion in biological applications...|$|R
40|$|Five {{different}} types of acid anhydrides such as succinic anhydride (SA), maleic anhydride (MA), phthalic anhydride (PA), 3, 4, 5, 6 -tetrahydrophthalic anhydride (TPA) and cis- 1, 2 -cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride (CDA) were used to prepare various polyalkyd resins from palm oil by following alcoholysis and esterification reaction. Palm oil was subjected to dehydration process using concentrated sulphuric acid prior to alcoholysis to improve the unsaturation in the fatty acid chains. Various physicochemical properties of the resins such as acid value, iodine value, yield, density, specific gravity, molecular weight, non-volatile material content, drying time, colour, solubility, etc., were tested by using standard methods. The resins were cured by using methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP), styrene and cobalt naphthenate at 120 °C. To enhance the thermal, structural and other resinous properties, 0. 5 wt% of montmorillonite nanoclays (MNCs) was dispersed in TPA-based resin. The cured films were tested for X-ray diffraction, surface morphology, tensile properties, pencil hardness, gloss, gel content, swelling <b>ratio,</b> <b>adhesion,</b> thermogravimetric analysis, and chemical resistivity. In addition, hydrophobicity of the cured films was observed by contact angle measurement. A comparison was drawn among the resins {{as well as the}} films prepared from different acid anhydrides. Analysis revealed that TPA-based resin/film shows improved characteristics among the others due to high degree of crosslinking. On the other hand, incorporation of MNCs into the polyalkyds led to higher thermal properties, acceptable pencil hardness and reduced wettability, which may suit this film to be applied for high-performance surface coating applications...|$|R
40|$|In 1984 Indonesia {{required}} more than 64. 000 ton of wheat flour for extender of urea formaldehyda (UF) adhesive in plywood industry. It is considered more economical when the wheat flour {{can be substituted}} by locally available carbohydrate such as sago (Metroxylon sp.). However, sago alone gives poor quality as an extender of UF adhesive. Iles-iles (Amorphophallus oncophyllus) is another potential source of carbohydrate. This contains more protein and mannan than that of wheat flour. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to explore the posisibility of mixing sago and iles-iles as a combined substitute for wheat flour as extender of UF adhesive. This work is intended to obtain optimal ratio of sago and iles-iles formulation, and then to compare its performance with that of wheat flour extender.

Surface modification of a propylene homopolymer, an ethylene / propylene copolymer, and a rubber-modified polypropylene (PP) has been studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), chemical derivatisation, contact angle measurement, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and an adhesion test. The wettability of PP surfaces {{was found to have}} been improved by solvent treatment. Mild adhesion level was obtained using solvent vapour treatment. Chromic acid etching and priming were found effective in improving the adhesion of PP. Flame treatment was found to give excellent <b>adhesion.</b> Optimum air-to-gas <b>ratio</b> and the distance from the inner cone tip of the flame to the polymer surface were found to be - 11 : 1 and 0. 5 - 1. 0 cm respectively. The non-correspondence between oxygen concentration and contact angle at high oxygen concentrations was attributed to sub-surface oxidation and the orientation / migration of oxygen containing functional groups away from the near surface during the flame treatment. This hypothesis was supported by angle resolved XPS results. The use of simple surface composition models has shown that the oxidation depth induced by a mild flame treatment is between 40 A and 60 A, and that oxygen containing functional groups may have orientated or migrated a few angstroms away from the near surface for an intense flame treatment. Trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) {{has been found to be}} a good derivatising reagent for hydroxyl groups. About 20...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} of new transvaginal ultrasound-scan-based markers and to compare them to conventional ultrasound methods used in the detection of common pelvic pathology in women with chronic pelvic pain (CPP). DESIGN: A prospective observational study. SETTING: Teaching hospital. POPULATION: A total of 120 consecutive women with CPP undergoing transvaginal ultrasonography before either diagnostic or operative laparoscopy. METHODS: Anatomical abnormalities, e. g. endometrioma or hydrosalpinx (hard markers), were documented. The woman was then assessed for {{the presence or absence}} of 'soft markers' (reduced ovarian mobility and site-specific pelvic tenderness). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Presence or absence of pelvic pathology noted during laparoscopy. RESULTS: Seventy women had pelvic pathology, of whom 51 had endometriosis alone, 7 both endometriosis and pelvic adhesions, 6 pelvic adhesions, 1 hydrosalpinx with endometriosis and 5 hydrosalpinx and pelvic <b>adhesions.</b> The likelihood <b>ratio</b> for the hard markers was infinity (specificity was 100 %), for the soft makers 1. 9 (95 % CI 1. 2 - 3. 1) and for a 'normal' ultrasound 0. 18 (0. 09 - 0. 34). The pre-test probability of pelvic disease in our population of women with CPP was 58 %, and this probability of disease was raised to 100 % with the presence of hard markers and to 73 % with the presence of soft markers. The pre-test probability of 58 % fell to 20 % when ultrasound finding was found to be normal. CONCLUSION: This new approach improves the detection and exclusion of significant pathology in women with CPP and may lead to a reduction in the number of unnecessary laparoscopies carried out on women with CPP. status: publishe...|$|R
