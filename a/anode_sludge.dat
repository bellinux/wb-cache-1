50|$|Sometra {{was founded}} {{as a private}} firm in 1939 {{for the purpose of}} zinc smelting. Initially, it had three {{distillation}} furnaces, with five more added in 1948, the year it was nationalized by the new communist regime. Its initial capacity was 3000 tons of zinc per year, expanded to 4000 tons in 1946. Between 1950 and 1960, capacity was gradually expanded to 28,000 tons a year. In 1955, a unit for producing sulfuric acid was inaugurated. The unit was expanded in 1966, a year that also saw the introduction of a system for agglomerating concentrates of zinc and lead. This was the culmination of a four-year program of thorough restructuring and modernization, with the new equipment having a capacity of 30,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of lead bullion per year. The 1967-1970 period saw the introduction of an electrolytic lead refining system (capacity 24,000 tons a year); a unit for extracting metallic bismuth for technical and pharmaceutical use from <b>anode</b> <b>sludge,</b> as well as gold and silver alloys and antimony slag; a unit for zinc sulfate production; a unit for zinc and ammonium chloride production; and an air preheater. Capacity was doubled between 1975 and 1984. A second zinc and lead extraction unit, with annual capacities of 30,000 tons (zinc) and 20,000 tons (lead) went online, as well as two thermal zinc refineries and greater cadmium refining. In 1983, metallic antimony production began by extracting the metal from slag, along with sodium thioantimoniate and stibnite. In 1984, a second blast furnace began operation, so that the old components built from 1939 to 1957 were retired. Between 1985 and 1989, zinc powder production began and a system for collecting residual gases was put in place. In 1988, a 250 m high chimney was built. By 1989, the plant was annually generating 43,490 tons of sulfuric acid (against a projected capacity of 126,000 tons), 23,519 tons of electrolytic lead (below the 38,000 tons projected), 29,840 tons of pure zinc, 2,094 tons of zinc powder, 19 tons of cadmium, 29 tons of bismuth and 195 tons of antimony.|$|E

The sludge contained amount of noble metals and rare metals, and also {{was an important}} resources for recovering noble metals. In this paper, ammonium thiocyante was used as leaching reagent for extracting gold from arsenic-free <b>anode</b> <b>sludge</b> (secondary sludge). Under the optical conditions, the leaching efficiency was up to 85. 1 %, while the dynamic behavior of gold leaching was studied, the activation energy of the system Ea= 20. 093 kJ•mol- 1, and reaction velocity constant k= 4. 084 e- 20093 /RT. The treatment of copper sludge could greatly reduce the potential contamination to the environment...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines is {{conducting}} research to recover strategic and critical metals such as Ni, Co, and Cr from mixed contaminated super-alloy scrap. One approach being studied involves melt refining of superalloy scrap to produce anodes for electrolytic deposition of Ni-Co alloy. This melt refining of superalloy turnings is described based on melt-oxidation and oxidation-carburization experiments, using roasted superalloy grinding sludge {{to supply the}} 0 needed to oxidize Cr and other readily oxidized elements to the slag. Controlled melt-carburization subsequent to oxidation improved the metal phase recovery of Ni and Co to well over 90 pct and decreased electrolytic solubility of Cr, Mo, and W by carbide formation. Electrolytic refining experiments were conducted using a controlled-potential mode (preset cathode potential). Data show effects of Fe and Cr impurities, cation concentration, electrolyte pH, S 04 -Cl electrolyte ratio, temperature, cathode potential, and cation-selective membrane use on current efficiency, current density, and deposit composition. Disposition of Ni, Co, Cr, MO, W, and Fe is compared for melt-oxidized versus oxidized-plus-carburized anodes. Deposits containing > 97 pct Ni + Co (major impurity Fe) have been routinely obtained from scrap anodes. Research is continuing to improve deposit quality in sustained deposition and to recover Cr and other metals from refining slags and <b>anode</b> <b>sludges...</b>|$|R

40|$|WO 200272924 A UPAB: 20030214 NOVELTY - Chroming {{apparatus}} comprises: (1) {{a working}} anode(s) for deposition; and (2) a separate oxidation anode(s), for oxidation of the Chromium (III) ions to Chromium (IV) ions, {{that is an}} electrode with a conductive diamond coating on a substrate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a chromating process, in which different anodes are used for deposition and oxidation of Chromium (III) ions to Chromium (IV) ions, in which the oxidation anode as above is used. USE - Used for regenerating solutions containing chromic acid by anodic oxidation of Chromium (III) to Chromium (IV) in electrolytic chromating baths, which are used for electroplating, chromation, etching e. g. acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) plastics and anodizing e. g. aluminum. ADVANTAGE - Chromium plating is normally carried out with lead anodes, which combine a double function, as counter-electrode (working electrode) and oxidation anode. In anodic operation, it becomes coated with lead dioxide. However, lead <b>anodes</b> form <b>sludge</b> and have limited dimensional stability. Various coated titanium anodes avoid this problem but have other drawbacks, including the need to add lead. The novel apparatus with the diamond-coated oxidation anode ensures effective oxidation of Chromium (III) to Chromium (IV) without costly maintenance procedures. The process is flexible and simple, even with complex geometries and structures, e. g. internal in plating of pipes and it eliminates the need to add lead and its associated drawbacks...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{fuel cells}} (MFCs) are devices that exploit {{microorganisms}} as biocatalysts to degrade organic matter or sludge present in wastewater (WW), and thereby generate electricity. We developed a simple, low-cost single-chamber {{microbial fuel cell}} (SCMFC) -type biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) sensor using carbon felt (<b>anode)</b> and activated <b>sludge,</b> and demonstrated its feasibility {{in the construction of}} a real-time BOD measurement system. Further, the effects of anodic pH and organic concentration on SCMFC performance were examined, and the correlation between BOD concentration and its response time was analyzed. Our results demonstrated that the SCMFC exhibited a stable voltage after 132 min following the addition of synthetic WW (BOD concentration: 200 mg/L). Notably, the response signal increased with an increase in BOD concentration (range: 5 - 200 mg/L) and was found to be directly proportional to the substrate concentration. However, at higher BOD concentrations (> 120 mg/L) the response signal remained unaltered. Furthermore, we optimized the SCMFC using synthetic WW, and tested it with real WW. Upon feeding real WW, the BOD values exhibited a standard deviation from 2. 08 to 8. 3 % when compared to the standard BOD 5 method, thus demonstrating the practical applicability of the developed system to real treatment effluents...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of electro-osmotic dewatering (EOD) {{is quite different}} from that of mechanical dewatering. Compared with the mechanical dewatering, EOD can be remarkably effective for hardly dewaterable suspensions of very fine particles and gelatinous materials. However, the gradual discontinuity of liquid state in the dewatering material, due to the formation of an unsaturated layer at the anode, causes the electrical blockage rendering EOD no longer effective. Mixing is believed to reduce such an effect. Therefore, a research is conducted to investigate this effect by having the anode rotating. An experimental apparatus was specially designed for this study. It consisted of one acrylic plastic cylinder, one porous stainless steel plate and one circular stainless steel plate. The porous plate acted as the cathode, and the circular plate as the rotating <b>anode.</b> Bentonite <b>sludge,</b> with 9. lwt% initial solid content was used as the model sludge. The rotational speed varied from 0 to 300 rpm. Three commercial impellers (axial flow impeller, high-shear dispersing impeller and high-shear radial flow impellers) were also used as rotating anodes and tested for their performances on EOD. The experimental results showed that, by using a flat plate as the rotating anode, the water removed from the sludge increased significantly with the rotational speed initially and reached a plateau at 240 rpm. This was believed due to the "fall-off" of the cake from the anode during the rotation. The solid content of the cake could be 23. 0 wt%, 60 % better than the performance of normal EOD. Besides, the excessive suspension added {{on the top of the}} anode was found to have a beneficial effect for both water removal and suppression of drier cake formation. It was also found that a constant thickness of the cake formed (about 5 mm) was more efficient in electro-osmotic dewatering. The combined effects of anode rotation and dry cake thickness control could remove 56 % of the initial moisture within the suspension. It was 37 % better than normal EOD. Different commercial impellers performed similarly at the rotational speed of 240 rpm. In addition, the value of rpm= 60 was found to be the most effective condition for dewatering in the case of using high shear dispersing impeller. At this optimal condition, the water removal enhancement was comparable with those obtained using the rotating plate with the dry cake thickness control. The interesting experimental results were well explained following the fundamental analysis of EOD...|$|R
30|$|Microbes in the anodic {{chamber of}} a MFC oxidise any added {{substrates}} and generate electrons and protons in the process. Carbon dioxide is produced as an oxidation byproduct. The electrons (e−) are {{absorbed by the}} anode and transported to the cathode through an external circuit. After crossing the proton exchange membrane (PEM) or a salt bridge (Fig.  1), the protons enter the cathodic chamber where they combine with oxygen to form water (Eq.  2). Microbes in the anodic zone extract electrons and protons in a dissimilative process of oxidising organic substrates. Bioelectricity generation occurs by keeping microbes separated from oxygen (i.e. under anaerobic conditions) or via end terminal acceptors other than the anode. This requires an anaerobic anodic chamber. Many microorganisms possess the ability to transfer electrons derived from the metabolism of organic matter to the <b>anode.</b> Wastewater and <b>sludge</b> produced from water and wastewater treatment processes are all rich sources for these specific microorganisms. The ideal performance of a MFC depends on the electrochemical reactions that occur between the organic substrate at a low potential such as with wastewater and the final electron acceptor having a high potential such as with oxygen. However, its ideal cell voltage is uncertain because the electrons are transferred to the anode from the organic substrate through a complex respiratory chain that varies from microbe to microbe and even for the same microbe when growth conditions differ. Nevertheless, the actual cell potential is always lower than its equilibrium potential because of irreversible losses in any system [7, 8].|$|R
