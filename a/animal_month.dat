40|$|A large {{database}} on {{the transmission}} of a stabilate of the Theileria parva Muguga stock from one breed of cattle using two stocks of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, Muguga and O 1 Pejeta was developed and analysed. Factors associated with the ticks and cattle, and the infections developing in cattle were studied {{in relation to the}} infection variables in the ticks batches harvested daily from cattle. Generalized Linear Interactive Modelling (GLIM) was used to determine the importance of factors and interactions in influencing the levels of tick infection variables using Type I and Type III sums of squares analyses. Analysis of the 6 varables, prevalence (percentage of ticks infected), abundance (mean number of infected salivary gland acini per tick examined) and intensity (mean number of infected salivary gland acini per infected tick) in batches of 30 male and 30 female ticks showed that 24 covariates, factors or interactions had a significant effect (P< 0. 05). Certain covariates and factors were particularly important for all 6 tick infection variables; parasitaemia of animal on the day of tick harvest, stabilate dilution administered to <b>animal,</b> <b>month</b> in which tick batch was harvested, minimum packed cell volume of animal over the sampling period, age of animal, and the minimum leukocyte count of the animal over the sampling period. The GLIM analyses were found to be a useful tool in identifying factors that influence infection levels and in devising methods of producing tick batches with more predictable infections...|$|E

However, in the cellular profile area, were not observed significant differences between the groups.

Male rats of both ages submitted to the same treatment showed no changes in rearing or ambulation. The low level of activity observed in the male control groups during the 2 nd and 4 th experimental week may probably explain the lack of lithium effect on the number of rearing (both age groups) and ambulation (older animals) activities.

40|$|Abstract: A {{study of}} safety of {{combined}} vaccination against myxomatosis and VHD was performed using a duly reconstituted vaccine {{made of a}} live homologous myxomatosis component SG 33 strain and of an inactivated VHD component in adjuvant AG 88 strain. The vaccine was administered intradermally to {{a representative sample of}} pet rabbits. A local reaction at the vaccine administration area was frequently observed from 2 to 3 days after vaccination in young animals. These local reactions were less frequently observed in adults. The reaction consisted of a local rash which usually disappeared 2 to 3 days after vaccination (maximum 1 week). The immune response following vaccination was monitored by antibody production against VHD and myxomatosis using, for the VHD vaccine component, an IHA titration method, and, for myxomatosis component, an ELISA titration method. Antibody production after vaccination was observed for both components. Maximum VHD IHA titre (192 ± 130) was obtained in vaccinated <b>animals</b> one <b>month</b> after vaccine administration.

40|$|This study compares insect {{and cattle}} {{consumption}} of crested wheatgrass (Agropycon spp.) {{on a site}} in Sterling Ranch, Utah County, Utah. The hypothesis tested is that insect consumption in general, and specifically consumption by Labops hesperius Uhler, significantly reduces total available cattle forage. Labops and grasshoppers were probably the major cause of secondary damage at the study site, while the impact of thrips is unknown. A detrimental impact on range was suggested by the data, as insects consumed forage equivalent to 2. 8 <b>animal</b> units per <b>month,</b> while cattle consumed forage equivalent to 2. 1 <b>animal</b> units per <b>month</b> at the study site.

40|$|Background: Myc is a {{well known}} driver of lymphomagenesis, and Myc-activating {{chromosomal}} translocation is the recognized hallmark of Burkitt lymphoma, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We developed a model that mimics this translocation event by inserting a mouse Myc cDNA gene into the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, just upstream of the intronic Eμ enhancer. These mice, designated iMycEμ, readily develop B-cell lymphoma. To study the mechanism of Myc-induced lymphoma, we analyzed signaling pathways in lymphoblastic B-cell lymphomas (LBLs) from iMycEμ mice, and an LBL-derived cell line, iMycEμ- 1. Results: Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) were constitutively activated in iMycEμ mice, not only in LBLs {{but also in the}} splenic B-lymphocytes of young <b>animals</b> <b>months</b> before tumors developed. Moreover, inhibition of either transcription factor in iMycEμ- 1 cells suppressed growth and caused apoptosis, and the abrogation of NF-κB activity reduced DNA binding by both STAT 3 and Myc, as well as Myc expression. Inhibition of STAT 3 signaling eliminated the activity of both NF-κB and Myc, and resulted in a corresponding decrease in the level of Myc. Thus, in iMycEμ- 1 cells NF-κB and STAT 3 are co-dependent and can both regulate Myc. Consistent with this, NF-κB and phosphorylated STAT 3 were physically associated with one another. In addition, LBLs and iMycEμ- 1 cells also showed constitutive AKT phosphorylation. Blocking AKT activation by inhibitin...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} how many animals your land will support (stocking rate), {{you need to know}} two things: 1) How much forage the particular animal or group of animals you have on your rangeland will consume, and 2) How much forage you have available. THE <b>ANIMAL</b> UNIT <b>MONTH</b> OR AUM The <b>animal</b> unit <b>month</b> (AUM) concept is the most widely used way to determine the carrying capacity of grazing animals on rangelands. The AUM provides us with the approximate amount of forage a 1000 lb cow with calf will eat in one month. It was standardized to the 1000 lb cow with calf when they were the most prevalent on rangeland. This AUM was established to be 800 lbs of forage on a dry weight basis (not green weight). All other animals were than converted to an “Animal Unit Equivalent ” of this cow. For example, a mature sheep has an Animal Unit Equivalent of 0. 20. This means a sheep eats about 20 % of the forage a cow will eat in one month. This allows mangers to match the number of animals with the amount of available forage. While there are numerous ways to calculate how many animals can be carried on a particular range, based on what is available and what is being eaten, the following table is a starting point. How it can be altered depends on your management goals and management intensity...|$|R

40|$|Fusion of {{vertebral}} bodies characterises {{many types of}} spine deformities in farmed Atlantic salmon and other bony fish. Little is known about development and progress of this condition in individual fish, knowledge that is required for prevention and control of spine malformations. To clarify the pathogenesis of vertebrae fusion, we describe the development and progress of the disease in farmed Atlantic salmon based on (a) tracing vertebrae fusion in individual fish at three different stages, (b) analyzing vertebrae fusion in <b>animals</b> 12 <b>months</b> after seawater transfer, and (c) histological examination of the fusion process. Vertebrae fusion was observed to develop both prior to and after smoltification; early and late fusion stages were detected in pre-smolts and in <b>animals</b> 12 <b>months</b> after seawater transfer. The process involves transformation of intervertebral notochord tissue into cartilage, shape alterations of vertebral body endplates, mineralisation of the intervertebral cartilage, and finally replacement of intervertebral cartilage by bone.
