5|$|The {{changes were}} met with {{critical}} reception in the province. Many students are now required to pay higher sports fees to cover higher transportation costs. Some schools {{do not have access}} to approved vehicles because the Education Act prohibits schools <b>and</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> from owning vehicles. To get around this they use corporate entities to operate vehicles for extracurricular activities. These require money to buy new vehicles and the required insurance, which often requires schools to conduct extra fundraising.|$|E

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 20 million animals are used annually for educational purposes in the United States including, classroom observational exercises, dissections and live-animal surgeries. Frogs, fetal pigs, perch, cats, earthworms, grasshoppers, crayfish and starfish are commonly used in classroom dissections. Alternatives {{to the use of}} animals in classroom dissections are widely used, with many U.S. States <b>and</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> mandating students be offered the choice to not dissect. Citing the wide availability of alternatives and the decimation of local frog species, India banned dissections in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The General Assembly {{approved}} $250 {{million in}} spending cuts and Daniels renegotiated 30 different state contracts for {{a savings of}} $190 million, resulting in a budget of $23 billion. Annual spending growth for future budgets was cut to 2.8% from the 5.9% that had been standard for many years. Increase in revenues, coupled with the spending reductions, led to a $300 million budget surplus. Indiana is not permitted to take loans, as borrowing was prohibited in its constitution following the 1837 state bankruptcy. The state, therefore, had financed its deficit spending by reallocating $760 million in revenue that belonged to local government <b>and</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> {{over the course of}} many years. The funds were gradually and fully restored to the municipal governments using the surplus money, and the state reserve fund was grown to $1.3 billion.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, many colleges <b>and</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> across Florida remained closed. President George W. Bush declared all of Florida a federal disaster area. Kennedy Space Center did not restore its complete work force until September 13 due to relief operations, as well as a lack of gasoline, ice, and water in the area. A total of 8000 members of the National Guard helped out with recovery efforts soon after the storm left the Florida peninsula. Residents in the areas of impact after the storm were under a boil water order, {{because of the lack of}} electricity to area water systems. Churches prepared meals for those without power and food themselves. Federal employees were granted excused absences if they helped with law enforcement and the cleanup. Thousands of portable generators were sent to the state by Home Depot and Lowe's home improvement stores. The United States Army Corps of Engineers installed blue tarpaulins on 41,556 damaged roofs statewide. Damage to the Florida citrus crop caused orange futures to rise four cents a pound due to Frances.|$|E

25|$|In {{the primary}} campaign, Fay argued for another {{national}} park, {{this time in}} the Big Thicket of east Texas, a state park on Mustang Island in the Gulf of Mexico, and a recreational area along Armand Bayou. He also urged the development of a comprehensive water plan and advocated reducing property taxes on the homes of the elderly.

25|$|Many {{teachers}} <b>and</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> {{oppose the}} idea of homeschooling.

According to a study done on the homeschool movement, homeschoolers often achieve academic success and admission into elite universities. There is also evidence that most are remarkably well socialized. According to the National Home Education Research Institute president, Brian Ray, socialization is not a problem for homeschooling children, many of whom are involved in community sports, volunteer activities, book groups, or homeschool co-ops.|$|E

Two cities, three towns, 64 incorporated villages, and more than 60 unincorporated hamlets are located within the county. There are 56 public school districts within the county.

25|$|The {{history of}} {{education}} in this region, North West Territories, began officially in 1885 with Territorial Ordinance #5. North West Territorial Schools Districts or One Room School Houses replaced trading post schooling, missionary schools and private schooling of the past. Moose Jaw School District #1 was formally established December 5, 1884 under the new Board of Education. The 1944 School Act set out to establish larger consolidated schools {{and the formation of}} the schools <b>and</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> presently in use. As with any Canadian province, the Saskatchewan Legislature has almost exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905, the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated before 1905, as well as to create and/or regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling). For historians and genealogists, previous school district records have been submitted to the Saskatchewan Provincial Archives Regina Branch.|$|E
25|$|As secretary, Cunningham {{oversaw the}} design and {{construction}} of the non-highway capital construction projects in Pennsylvania, {{as well as the}} state's minority and women-owned business contracting program and the Bureau of Commonwealth Media Services. Additionally, he served as the state’s real estate agent and insurance broker, and doubled the state's property insurance coverage while reducing premiums nearly by half, saving more than $4 million annually. He also ran the Governor's management and productivity initiative, which saved the state $500 million in operating costs. Cunningham also led initiatives to sell surplus state property, with the intention of saving taxpayer money, putting the properties back onto tax rolls, and creating community and economic development opportunities. He urged local governments <b>and</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> in Pennsylvania to buy equipment from state contracts, thus realizing financial savings, and also consolidated warehouse facilities in Harrisburg from 17 buildings to four, for an annual saving of $4 million. In addition to his secretary position, Cunningham served on the State Public School Building Authority, the Pennsylvania Higher Educational Facilities Authority, the Governor’s Homeland Security Advisory Council, the PENNVEST board, the Capitol Preservation Committee, and the Agricultural Land Preservation Interagency Committee during his time in Rendell's administration.|$|E
500|$|Supporters of {{the earlier}} {{decision}} were displeased with this decision. The language [...] "all deliberate speed" [...] was seen by critics as too ambiguous to ensure reasonable haste for compliance with the court's instruction. Many Southern states <b>and</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> interpreted [...] "Brown II" [...] as legal justification for resisting, delaying, and avoiding significant integration for years—and in some cases {{for a decade or}} more—using such tactics as closing down school systems, using state money to finance segregated [...] "private" [...] schools, and [...] "token" [...] integration where a few carefully selected black children were admitted to former white-only schools but the vast majority remained in underfunded, unequal black schools.|$|E

500|$|Schools <b>and</b> <b>school</b> <b>{{district}}s</b> caused angry {{debate between}} commuters and long-time residents. School district lines were independent {{of those of}} townships, for every school formed its own school district. Accordingly, townships could contain a number of school districts: Bergen County's Franklin Township in the early 1890s contained eleven school districts serving 774 students. Bergen County was sparsely populated when the railroad lines went through in the 1850s, making for a different pattern of development than other suburban counties, such as Union and Camden, which saw more planned development around railroad stations. Bergen's pattern of development was unique in New Jersey, with, until 1894, several commuter suburbs in a single township, something rare elsewhere in the state.|$|E
