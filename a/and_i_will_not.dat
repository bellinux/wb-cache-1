After the election, Keyes {{declined}} to congratulate Obama, explaining that {{his refusal to}} congratulate Obama was [...] "not anything personal", but was meant {{to make a statement}} against [...] "extend false congratulations to the triumph of what we have declared to be across the line" [...] of reasonable propriety. He said that Obama's position on moral issues regarding life and the family had crossed that line. [...] "I'm supposed to make a call that represents the congratulations toward the triumph of that which I believe ultimately stands for... a culture evil enough to destroy the very soul and heart of my country? I cannot do this. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> make a false gesture," [...] Keyes said.|$|E
500|$|After {{giving his}} team the news, McKechnie had the Reds {{dedicate}} themselves to winning the World Series [...] "for Hershie". His number was retired {{for the season}} by the team as a tribute. McKechnie never publicly revealed what Willard Hershberger said to him during their meeting the day before: [...] "It {{had nothing to do}} with anybody on the team", he told reporters. [...] "He told it to me in confidence, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> utter it to anyone". The Cincinnati Reds would go on to defeat the American League champion Detroit Tigers in seven games to win the 1940 World Series. Reds players decided to share a portion of their championship money, totaling $5,803, with Hershberger's mother, Maude. Hershberger was buried at Visalia Public Cemetery in Visalia, California.|$|E
500|$|As vice president-elect, Tyler {{remained}} quietly at {{his home}} in Williamsburg. [...] He privately expressed hopes that Harrison would prove decisive and not allow intrigue in the Cabinet, especially in the first days of the administration. Tyler did not participate in selecting the Cabinet, and did not recommend anyone for federal office in the new Whig administration. Harrison, beset by office seekers and the demands of Senator Clay, twice sent letters to Tyler asking his advice as to whether a Van Buren appointee should be dismissed. [...] In both cases, Tyler recommended against, and Harrison wrote, [...] "Mr. Tyler says they ought not to be removed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> remove them." [...] The two men met briefly in Richmond in February, and reviewed a parade together, though they did not discuss politics.|$|E

500|$|Washington was the DAR's first Registrar General, and {{her name}} appears as member [...] "number one" [...] on the [...] "grand roll" [...] of membership. Washington also served as {{secretary}} general, vice president general, and in 1895 she became honorary vice president general, an office which she held until her death. Under Washington's leadership, the society raised funds for a national monument to Mary Ball Washington, mother of George Washington. Washington ardently carried out the duties of her offices at DAR, despite suffering with a serious eye condition that {{made it difficult for}} her to write. Washington stated, [...] "We want a patriotic society founded on service <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> become a member of an organization which is founded on rank and not on the service of the ancestors." ...|$|E
500|$|Indeed, at times, his sarcasm was {{directed}} even at his superiors, with Nansouty clashing {{with the more}} senior Grouchy at the Battle of Friedland. Nevertheless, Grouchy later recognised that the actions of Nansouty's division throughout the battle were [...] "glorious". In 1809, Nansouty famously responded to Napoleon's criticism after the Battle of Wagram by saying: [...] "It is not Your Majesty at any rate who can {{teach me how to}} handle cavalry." [...] Three years later, during the campaign in Russia, when Murat, King of Naples complained to him about the lack of resistance of the horses, Nansouty retorted: [...] "Oh yes, Sire, this is because they lack patriotism." [...] At the Battle of Craonne, in 1814, one day before resigning, he was recorded to have refused to execute Napoleon's order to assault a redoubt, a move which he saw as a death sentence to his men. Instead, Nansouty told the Emperor: [...] "I am going alone. There is nothing but death there <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> lead these brave soldiers to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Streltsov {{was known}} for womanising, {{drinking}} heavily and leading an extravagant life outside of football, {{as well as for}} wearing his hair in the British [...] "Teddy Boy" [...] style. As a key player for his club and for the Soviet national side, these traits combined to create an impression in government circles that, in Wilson's words, [...] "Streltsov was becoming rather too much of a celebrity". The problem was brought to a head by an alleged relationship between the footballer and Svetlana Furtseva, the 16-year-old daughter of the first female Politburo member Ekaterina Furtseva. With the young Svetlana besotted by the 19-year-old Torpedo forward, her mother first met him at a Kremlin ball held early in 1957 to celebrate the Olympic victory of 1956. Furtseva suggested he might marry her daughter, to which Streltsov replied [...] "I already have a fiancée <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> marry her [...]" [...] While drunk, he was later heard to remark either [...] "I would never marry that monkey" [...] or [...] "I would rather be hanged than marry such a girl" [...] (both quotes were reported), humiliating Furtseva, a minister close to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev.|$|E

500|$|As usual, the Earps {{carried their}} revolvers in their coat pockets {{or in their}} waistbands. Wyatt Earp was {{carrying}} a [...]44 caliber American 1869 Smith & Wesson revolver. Holliday was carrying a nickel-plated pistol in a holster, but this was concealed by his long coat, as was the shotgun. The Earps and Holliday walked west, down {{the south side of}} Fremont Street past the rear entrance to the O.K. Corral, but out of visual range of the Cowboys' last reported location. Near the corner of Fourth St. and Fremont St., the Earps ran into Sheriff Behan. He had left the Cowboys and came toward them, though he looked nervously backward several times. Virgil testified afterward that Behan told them, [...] "For God's sake, don't go down there or they will murder you!" [...] Wyatt said Behan told him and Morgan, [...] "I have disarmed them." [...] Behan testified afterward that he'd only said he'd gone down to the Cowboys [...] "for the purpose of disarming them," [...] not that he'd actually disarmed them. One eye witness, laundryman Peter H. Fallehy, wrote in his testimony afterward that Virgil Earp told Behan, [...] "those men have made their threats <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> arrest them but I will kill them on sight." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{preparations}} complete, Cochrane {{ordered the}} attack {{for the evening}} of 11 April, although Gambier was reluctant to allow his sailors to support Cochrane in the operation, saying [...] "if you choose to rush to self-destruction that is your own affair [...] [...] [...] but it is my duty {{to take care of}} the lives of others, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> place the crews of the fireships in palpable danger". Cochrane was furious and after a bitter argument Gambier relented and gave permission for the attack to go ahead. He stationed Imperieuse near the Boyart Shoal to the north of the boom, approximately [...] from the French fleet, supported by frigates HMS Aigle, HMS Unicorn and HMS Pallas. This force would collect the crews of the fireships as they abandoned their blazing charges and rowed back towards the British line, and sloops HMS Redpole and HMS Lyra were equipped as light ships to guide the fireships into the channel. [...] With these ships were the schooner HMS Whiting and cutters Nimrud and King George, all converted into floating rocket batteries. Aetna and two brigs anchored north of the forts on Île-d'Aix, while frigate Emerald and five smaller warships were to launch a diversionary attack to the east of the island. Gambier, with the main body of the fleet, moved closer to the entrance to Aix Roads, eventually anchoring [...] distant; it has been suggested by one historian that he may have done so in order that he could retreat out to sea easily should the French fleet attempt to attack him in the aftermath of a failed fireship assault.|$|E
