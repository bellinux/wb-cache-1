25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{reference to}} the jedars is in the lost Tarikh of the 11th-century historian Ibrahim ar-Raqiq, in extracts preserved {{in the works of}} Ibn Khaldun and other later writers. ar-Raqiq relates that when the Fatimid caliph Ismail al-Mansur was conducting military operations in the Tiaret area, he was shown the jedars at Jabal Lakhdar <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what the dedicatory inscriptions said; he was given a fanciful translation that the monuments were built to celebrate a military victory by the Byzantine army of Justinian I. Although Ibn Khaldun lived in the area for a number of years, he made no other {{reference to the}} jedars.|$|E

Despite the game's controlling body agreeing to it, the Australian Cricket Board vetoed it {{on the grounds that it}} might lead to umpires being quizzed by teams after every game and meant that the throwing controversy would continue into the World Series Cup during the coming week. The Sri Lankans were disappointed they did not get an explanation and decided they would continue playing their bowler in matches not umpired by Hair <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether other umpires would support or reject Hair's judgement.|$|E
25|$|From 1909 to 1912, Laue was a Privatdozent at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, under Arnold Sommerfeld, at LMU. During the 1911 Christmas recess and in January 1912, Paul Peter Ewald was {{finishing}} {{the writing of}} his doctoral thesis under Sommerfeld. It was on a walk through the Englischer Garten in Munich in January, that Ewald told Laue about his thesis topic. The wavelengths of concern to Ewald were in the visible region of the spectrum and hence {{much larger than the}} spacing between the resonators in Ewald’s crystal model. Laue seemed distracted <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what would be the effect if much smaller wavelengths were considered. In June, Sommerfeld reported to the Physikalische Gesellschaft of Göttingen on the successful diffraction of x-rays by Laue, Paul Knipping and Walter Friedrich at LMU, for which Laue would be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, in 1914. While at Munich, he wrote the first volume of his book on relativity during the period 1910 to 1911.|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} been cited as an {{influence}} on director Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. After initially denying having seen Bakshi's film, Jackson admitted to having first encountered The Lord of the Rings via Bakshi's film, stating that the film was a [...] "brave and ambitious attempt." [...] In another interview, Jackson stated that he [...] "enjoyed [...] <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more." [...] Bakshi {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "Peter Jackson did say that the first film inspired him to go on and do the series, but that happened after I was bitching and moaning to a lot of interviewers that he said at the beginning that he never saw the movie. I thought that was kind of fucked up." [...] On the audio commentary for the DVD release of , Jackson acknowledges one shot, a low angle of a hobbit at Bilbo's birthday party shouting [...] "Proudfeet!", as an intentional homage to Bakshi's film.|$|E

500|$|In 1991, Sackett {{discovered}} a partly-completed manuscript while she researched documents for her book Inside Trek. This prompted her to suggest {{sending it to}} Pocket Books, which held the rights to Star Trek novels at the time, despite the prior agreement with Bantam. Roddenberry was not enthusiastic about the idea, but editor David Stern at Pocket Books was interested <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether Sackett and fellow writer Fred Bronson {{would be able to}} expand and complete it. Contract negotiations for the work began in April 1991, during which time Sackett had a version re-typed because no electronic versions were available and the type on the existing print out was faint in places. The writers were dealing with Roddenberry's lawyer Leonard Maizlish, but discussions lasted over six months. Two days after Roddenberry's death on October 24, they were informed that work on the novel would not continue. Sackett said this may have been linked to her dismissal from the [...] television series following Roddenberry's death. Pocket Books brought in Michael Jan Friedman to finish the work, but it was never published.|$|E
500|$|For the {{upcoming}} God of War title, Barlog explained that Kratos {{had to change}} his cycle of violence {{and learn how to}} control his rage. He said that Kratos had made many bad decisions, which led to the destruction of Olympus, <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what would happen if Kratos made a good decision. The birth of Barlog's own son influenced the idea of Kratos' character change. The canceled live-action Star Wars television series was also an influence. The bond between Kratos and his son {{is at the heart of}} the game and Barlog said [...] "This game is about Kratos teaching his son how to be a god, and his son teaching Kratos how to be human again." [...] Referencing the Marvel Comics character Hulk, Barlog said that in regards to Kratos, [...] "We've already told the story of The Hulk. We want to tell the story of Banner now." [...] Christopher Judge, best known as Teal'c from Stargate SG-1, replaces T.C. Carson as the voice of Kratos in the game; Carson had voiced Kratos since the original God of War. Commenting in response to the change, Carson said, [...] "Sony went in a new direction." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{traveller}} {{explains in}} [...] "Part III" [...] {{how he is}} the son of an Oxford mathematics professor. When young, he loved to read outdoors <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how the world worked. He became an architect and travelled throughout Europe. Eventually he married a lovely woman with whom he had a son, Henry. One day the couple left their son with his nurse during an outing and she fell asleep. When they returned, their son was gone, and he could not be found. The traveller spent years searching the countryside for his son; one day he met the woman, Dame Smithson, who had stolen his son. To please her sailor husband who wanted a child, she lied to him and said she was pregnant. Before his return, she needed a child, so she stole the traveller's. Unused to the harsh life of a peasant, the child suffered and became sickly. As a result, the woman's husband disliked him and beat him, believing him to be worthless. Hearing this story, Maurice reveals himself to be the traveller's son; he had changed his name to avoid the person he believed to be his cruel father. Overjoyed to be reunited with his son, the traveller buys the cottage for him and they return every once in a while. Maurice is educated, grows up, and travels widely. He returns to see that the cottage has disintegrated; he builds a new one for another poor fisherman's family, beside the lot of the old one.|$|E

Pavlica explained, [...] "In the Pilot, the other medical examiners seemed to hope they could somehow get rid of Megan by tattling on things to Kate.

2500|$|In 1984, at {{the final}} preview of Starlight Express, Crawford {{happened}} to run into the show's creator, Andrew Lloyd Webber.
