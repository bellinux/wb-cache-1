5|$|A heated altercation between Ramirez and {{teammate}} Kevin Youkilis {{took place}} on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez {{has been slow to}} join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike zone, as well as the first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an out. Before the fifth inning, Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> <b>at</b> Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.|$|E

25|$|On April 14, 2005, a Red Sox fan {{leaned over}} the railing at Fenway Park and distracted Sheffield as {{he was going to}} field a ball hit by Jason Varitek. After Sheffield took <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> <b>at</b> him with his glove, he threw the ball back into the infield, and then got into a verbal altercation with him. Fan Interference was not called, {{resulting}} in a game tying RBI Triple for Varitek. The fan, a long-time season ticket holder, was not ejected from Fenway Park, but he donated his remaining 2005 season tickets to charity in an effort to avoid any controversy {{for the remainder of the}} season. Sheffield was fined for the incident. Charges were dismissed against both the fan and Sheffield.|$|E

[...] "I think they were just exchanging some views on things", manager Terry Francona said. [...] "We {{had a lot of}} testosterone going tonight."

500|$|Politically, Tucker was a Jeffersonian Republican, delighted at {{the split}} in the Federalists between John Adams and Alexander Hamilton, and joined in the resentment toward Federalist {{attempts}} to [...] "appoint a president" [...] by party caucus. But in time he departed his near-Jacobin leanings and became a pro-bank Republican. He once gave a speech {{in support of a}} Federalist in a local election, and a staunch Republican, Lewis Harvey, called him a party traitor and liar. In reaction, the often hot-tempered Tucker took <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> <b>at</b> him but missed due the intervention of a neutral party. Assuming his challenge unsuccessful, Tucker demanded satisfaction which Harvey accepted. Tucker carefully arranged the duel, stipulating an extraordinary distance in paces, so as to diminish the superior marksmanship of his opponent. Fortunately for Tucker the duel was avoided at the last moment—though not before he had completed his will and arranged his estate for his [...] expecting wife. Their first child, Daniel George, was born November 23, 1802.|$|E
2500|$|The {{defending}} {{player has}} {{a variety of}} opportunities for his team to gain possession of the ball. He can push the opponent off the line or steal the ball from the opponent. Another common defensive play is called [...] "hooking." [...] While a player is taking <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> <b>at</b> the ball, his opponent can block the swing by using his mallet to hook the mallet of the player swinging at the ball. A player may hook only if he is on the side where the swing is being made or directly behind an opponent. A player may not purposely touch another player, his tack or pony with his mallet. Unsafe hooking is a foul that will result in a penalty shot being awarded. For example, it is a foul for a player to reach over an opponent's mount in an attempt to hook.|$|E

2500|$|When Sammartino {{was about}} 51 years old, he was {{involved}} in a backstage fight with a former football player. Six men were backstage at a wrestling show in an area that was restricted, and when Sammartino spotted the men, he told them that if security saw them in this area, they might get in trouble. Dave [...] "Rooster" [...] Fleming, a former CFL player with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, stuck his hand out to Sammartino. When Sammartino went to shake his hand, Fleming began to squeeze hard, and Sammartino asked him what he was doing, to which Fleming replied, [...] "You're nothing but a washed up old man". Sammartino responded, [...] "Not too washed up to take care of you". Upon hearing that, Fleming took <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> <b>at</b> Sammartino, but Sammartino blocked it and knocked him down with a punch. Sammartino soon found himself fighting the other five men at once. At this time, The Iron Sheik was in the showers after his match and heard the commotion. He immediately jumped in next to Sammartino and the two wrestlers proceeded to [...] "clean house".|$|E

A constitutional reserve of manner had by this time told with wholesome and, for me, commodious effect, on the manners of my co-inmates; rarely did I now suffer from rude or intrusive treatment.
