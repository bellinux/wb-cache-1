5|$|Psoriasis is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a genetic disease that is triggered by environmental factors. In twin studies, identical twins <b>are</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> more likely to be affected compared to non-identical twins. This suggests that genetic factors predispose to psoriasis. Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress can also play a role. Psoriasis is not contagious. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system reacting to skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E
5|$|All ankylosaurs that possess these {{characteristics}} - a narrow predentary; a nearly horizontal quadrate {{that is not}} fused and is oriented 30 degrees from the skull roof; the presence of mandibular condyles that <b>are</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> wider than long; premaxillary and dentary teeth that are near a symphysis with {{the front of the}} lower jaw (the predentary); a sacrum arched on top; an acromion process above the midpoint of the scapula to coracoid attachment; a straight ischium with a straight dorsal margin; relatively long, slender limbs; sacral shield armour; and the presence of erect pelvic osteoderms with flat bases - form a clade of basal nodosaurids, the Struthiosaurinae. That set of cranial and postcranial features are only present on genera considered to be in the clade. The features above distinguish Struthiosaurinae from other clades and genera found by other analysis'.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{show that}} {{fraternity}} men <b>are</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> {{more likely to}} commit rape than other men on college campuses. Fraternities have often been accused of fostering rape-supportive attitudes by promoting male dominance and brotherhood, and fraternity affiliation {{has been found to}} be a significant predictor of sexually predatory behavior in retrospective research. Furthermore, studies show that women in sororities are almost twice as likely to experience rape than other college women.|$|E
25|$|Neutering {{increases}} {{life expectancy}} in cats: {{one study found}} castrated male cats live {{twice as long as}} intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females. Non-neutered cats in the USA <b>are</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> more likely to require treatment for an animal bite. Having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine, cervical or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer.|$|E

25|$|No single, {{exclusive}} {{cause of}} developmental stuttering is known. A variety of hypotheses and theories suggests multiple {{factors contributing to}} stuttering. Among these is the strong evidence that stuttering has a genetic basis. Children who have first-degree relatives who stutter <b>are</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> as likely to develop a stutter. However, twin and adoption studies suggest that genetic factors interact with environmental factors for stuttering to occur, and many people who stutter have no family history of the disorder.|$|E
25|$|High risk {{procedures}} {{or medical}} specialties {{are responsible for}} most avoidable adverse events. (Although some mistakes, such as in surgery, are harder to conceal, errors occur in all levels of care. Even though complex procedures entail more risk, adverse outcomes are not usually due to error, but to {{the severity of the}} condition being treated.). However, USP has reported that medication errors {{during the course of a}} surgical procedure <b>are</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> more likely to cause harm to a patient than those occurring in other types of hospital care.|$|E

A cat's whiskers are {{more than twice as}} thick as ordinary cat hairs, and their roots <b>are</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> deeper in a cat's tissue than other hairs. They have numerous nerve endings at their base, which give cats extraordinarily detailed information about nearby air movements and objects with which they make physical contact. They enable a cat to know that it is near obstacles without it needing to see them.|$|E

25|$|Smoking is {{the cause}} of about 5 million deaths per year. This makes it {{the most common cause of}} {{preventable}} early death. One study found that male and female smokers lose on average of 13.2 and 14.5 years of life, respectively. Another found a loss of life of 6.8 years. Each cigarette that is smoked is estimated to shorten life by an average of 11 minutes. At least half of all lifelong smokers die earlier as a result of smoking. Smokers <b>are</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> as likely to die before the age of 60 or 70 as non-smokers.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scientists}} propose using brain imaging to help {{decide which}} soon-to-be-released offenders are {{at greater risk}} for reoffending. The brain imaging data would be used along with common factors like age, prior arrests, and marital status. To support this idea, in a 2013 study, Professor Kent Kiehl from the University of New Mexico studying the population of 96 male offenders in the state’s prisons found that offenders with low activity in the anterior cingulate cortex where twice as likely to commit an offense in the four years after their release as those who had high activity in this region. Similarly, Dustin Pardini conducted that which shows that men with a smaller amygdala <b>are</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> more likely to commit violence three years after their release.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} a number of Islamic ex-gay (i.e. people {{claiming}} to have experienced a basic change in sexual orientation from exclusive homosexuality to exclusive heterosexuality) groups aimed at attempting to guide homosexuals towards heterosexuality. A large body of research and global scientific consensus indicates that being gay, lesbian, or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and social adjustment. Because of this, major mental health professional organizations discourage and caution individuals against attempting to change their sexual orientation to heterosexual, and warn that attempting to do so can be harmful. People who have gone through conversion therapy face 8.9 times the rates of suicide ideation, face depression at 5.9 {{times the rate of}} their peers and <b>are</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> more likely to use illegal drugs compared to those who did not go through the therapy.|$|E

25|$|The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) sets {{official}} {{standards for}} all prescription and over-the-counter medicines, dietary supplements, and other healthcare products manufactured {{and sold in}} the United States, but USP standards are also recognized and used in more than 130 other countries. USP operates two programs to promote patient safety. The Medication Errors Reporting Program enables healthcare professionals to report medication errors directly to USP. MEDMARX, an internet-based error and drug reaction reporting program, is designed for use in hospitals. The USP analyzes the data it receives through its reporting programs, develops professional education programs and disseminates alerts related to medication errors. The MEDMARX report released in 2007 analyzed 11,000 medication errors during surgery in 500 hospitals between 1998 and 2005. The analysis showed that medication errors that happen {{in the operating room}} or recovery areas <b>are</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> more likely to harm a patient than errors occurring in other types of hospital care. , this was the largest known analysis of medical errors related to surgery.|$|E
25|$|July 3 - Battle of Santiago de Cuba: On July 1, the Spanish Governor of Cuba, General Blanco, ordered Admiral Cervera {{to run the}} {{blockade}} and escape the harbor at Santiago de Cuba. Cervera does so at 9:00 A.M. on July 3, just hours after U.S. Rear Admiral Sampson leaves his fleet for an on-shore conference (leaving Commodore Schley in command of both the Flying Squadron and North Atlantic Squadron). Cervera's fleet consists of the armored cruisers Infanta Maria Teresa (his flagship), Vizcaya, Cristóbal Colón, and Almirante Oquendo, and the destroyers Plutón and Furor. Although Cervera surprises the American fleet by sortying during daylight, the American ships respond quickly, and <b>are</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> larger than and outgun Cervera's ships (whose weapons are in disrepair). The Spanish Navy loses all six ships (sank or scuttled); 323 Spanish sailors are wounded, 151 killed, and 1,720 captured, while just one American sailor is killed and one is wounded.|$|E
25|$|Ketamine is {{absorbable}} by intravenous, intramuscular, oral, and topical routes due to {{both its}} water and lipid solubilities. When administered orally, it undergoes first-pass metabolism, {{where it is}} biotransformed in the liver by CYP3A4 (major), CYP2B6 (minor), and CYP2C9 (minor) isoenzymes into norketamine (through N-demethylation) and finally dehydronorketamine. Intermediate in the biotransformation of norketamine into dehydronorketamine is the hydroxylation of norketamine into hydroxynorketamine by CYP2B6 and CYP2A6. Dehydronorketamine, followed by norketamine, is the most prevalent metabolite detected in urine. As the major metabolite of ketamine, norketamine is one-third to one-fifth as potent as an anesthetic, and plasma levels of this metabolite <b>are</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> higher than ketamine following oral administration. Bioavailability through the oral route reaches 17–20%; bioavailability through other routes are: 93% intramuscularly, 25–50% intranasally, 30% sublingually, and 30% rectally. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within a minute intravenously, 5–15 min intramuscularly, and 30 min orally. Ketamine's duration of action in a clinical setting is 30 min to 2 h intramuscularly and 4–6 h orally.|$|E
