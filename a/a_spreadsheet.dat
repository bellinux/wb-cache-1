5|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} problems {{of this type}} concern collections of objects {{that need to be}} updated, such as the cells of <b>a</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> after one of the cells has been changed, or the object files of a piece of computer software after its source code has been changed.|$|E
5|$|DAGs can model many {{different}} kinds of information. <b>A</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> can be modeled as a DAG, with a vertex for each cell and an edge whenever the formula in one cell uses the value from another; a topological ordering of this DAG can be used to update all cell values when the spreadsheet is changed.|$|E
5|$|Computer {{forensics}} {{can deal}} with {{a broad range of}} information; from logs (such as internet history) through to the actual files on the drive. In 2007 prosecutors used <b>a</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> recovered from the computer of Joseph E. Duncan III to show premeditation and secure the death penalty. Sharon Lopatka's killer was identified in 2006 after email messages from him detailing torture and death fantasies were found on her computer.|$|E

5|$|For instance, {{when one}} cell of <b>a</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> changes, it is {{necessary}} to recalculate the values of other cells that depend directly or indirectly on the changed cell. For this problem, the tasks to be scheduled are the recalculations of the values of individual cells of the spreadsheet. Dependencies arise when an expression in one cell uses a value from another cell. In such a case, the value that is used must be recalculated earlier than the expression that uses it. Topologically ordering the dependency graph, and using this topological order to schedule the cell updates, allows the whole spreadsheet to be updated with only a single evaluation per cell. Similar problems of task ordering arise in makefiles for program compilation and instruction scheduling for low-level computer program optimization.|$|E
25|$|Google Docs, Sheets and Slides are a word processor, <b>a</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> and a {{presentation}} program, respectively. The three services originate from company acquisitions in 2006, and are today integrated into Google Drive. They all serve as collaborative software that allow users to view and edit documents, spreadsheets and presentations together in real-time through {{a web browser}} or mobile device. Changes are saved automatically, with a revision history keeping track of changes. Google Forms, meanwhile, is a tool that allows collecting information from users via a personalized survey or quiz. The information is then collected and automatically connected to <b>a</b> <b>spreadsheet.</b> The spreadsheet is populated with the survey and quiz responses.|$|E

The iPad version was released on 27 January 2010. The app was later updated to support iPhone and iPod Touch.|$|E
25|$|Use of Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) objects limits interoperability, {{because these}} objects are not widely {{supported}} in programs for viewing or editing files (e.g. embedding of other files inside the file, such as tables or charts from <b>a</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> application {{in a text}} document or presentation file). If software that understands an OLE object is not available, the object is usually replaced by a picture (bitmap representation of the object) or not displayed at all.|$|E
25|$|At {{the core}} of any OLAP system is an OLAP cube (also called a 'multidimensional cube' or a hypercube). It {{consists}} of numeric facts called measures that are categorized by dimensions. The measures are placed at the intersections of the hypercube, which is spanned by the dimensions as a vector space. The usual interface to manipulate an OLAP cube is a matrix interface, like Pivot tables in <b>a</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> program, which performs projection operations along the dimensions, such as aggregation or averaging.|$|E

25|$|Richard MacDuff, a young {{software}} engineer working for WayForward Technologies II, owned by Gordon Way.

25|$|If, for {{environmental}} or other reasons, a solvent or solvent blend {{is required to}} replace another of equivalent solvency, the substitution can {{be made on the}} basis of the Hansen solubility parameters of each. The values for mixtures are taken as the weighted averages of the values for the neat solvents. This can be calculated by trial-and-error, <b>a</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> of values, or HSP software. A 1:1 mixture of toluene and 1,4 dioxane has δD, δP and δH values of 17.8, 1.6 and 5.5, comparable to those of chloroform at 17.8, 3.1 and 5.7 respectively. Because of the health hazards associated with toluene itself, other mixtures of solvents may be found using a full HSP dataset.|$|E

The objective is an "intelligent structure monitor" to run beside Excel, allowing users to reconfigure spreadsheets to the representational needs of the task at hand.

25|$|Excel Mobile is <b>a</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> {{program that}} can edit XLSX files. It can edit and format text in cells, {{calculate}} formulas, search within the spreadsheet, sort rows and columns, freeze panes, filter the columns, add comments, and create charts. It can't add columns or rows {{except at the}} edge of the document, rearrange columns or rows, delete rows or columns, or add spreadsheet tabs. The 2007 version has the ability to use a full-screen mode to deal with limited screen resolution, as well as split panes to view different parts of a worksheet at one time. Protection settings, zoom settings, autofilter settings, certain chart formatting, hidden sheets, and other features are not supported on Excel Mobile, and will be modified upon opening and saving a workbook. In 2015, Excel Mobile became available for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile on Windows Store.|$|E
25|$|When {{writing the}} stories, {{he started with}} their twist endings, and then worked his way back from that. He {{designed}} {{the flow of the}} story by using <b>a</b> <b>spreadsheet,</b> and wrote prototypes of potential outcomes of the different scenarios in the game; after this, he matched it with the flowchart he had made, and came up with the details of each story. As he wrote each scene, he imagined what the player might be thinking as they play through it, and decided what to write based on it; {{this was one of the}} most important things to him when writing. A key element to Uchikoshi when writing the outcomes of player decisions is that the importance of the decision usually is much greater after the player has made it, with the consequences only being revealed later on as the player learns more information; this was to maintain the high suspense level, and to avoid situations where choices end up not actually mattering. One big challenge for him was to maintain player interest through all branches; he tried to have each branch develop differently, as to avoid repetition and fatigue, and keep the player motivated. While he came up with the set-up, the setting, and the characters on his own, he had a sub-writer helping him with writing the second game, and two sub-writers for the third game. They would help with brainstorming ideas and finding what does not work so well and how to improve scenarios.|$|E

40|$|Spreadsheets {{are often}} used in business, for simple tasks, {{as well as for}} mission {{critical}} tasks such as finance or forecasting. Similar to software, some spreadsheets are of better quality than others, for instance with respect to usability, maintainability or reliability. In contrast with software however, spreadsheets are rarely checked, tested or certified. In this paper, we aim at developing an approach for detecting smells that indicate weak points in <b>a</b> <b>spreadsheet’s</b> design. To that end we first study code smells and transform these code smells to their spreadsheet counterparts. We then present an approach to detect the smells, and communicate located smells to spreadsheet users with data flow diagrams. We analyzed occurrences of these smells in the Euses corpus. Furthermore we conducted ten case studies in an industrial setting. The results of the evaluation indicate that smells can indeed reveal weaknesses in <b>a</b> <b>spreadsheet’s</b> design, and that data flow diagrams are an appropriate way to show those weaknesses.
