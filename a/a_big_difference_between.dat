Indoor pools of 25 m give the {{advantage}} of being able to use the turning point to push off again using ones legs, thus giving a clear advantage over 50 m and of course open water venues. Open sea gives the really bad side effect of large waves and the tides, which will sometimes push the swimmer back to where they came from, this can be clearly seen in the differences in times between the Channel crossing and the almost double in length Maraton Acuatica Rio Coronda which she performed in two hours less.|$|E
25|$|The {{input-output}} equations {{could be}} made to work, only if additional assumptions were made. But even in a dynamic model, it can be shown mathematically that assumptions (1), (3) and (4) have a crippling effect on the plausibility of longterm quantitative results obtained with the model. However, what ought to be concluded from this modelling exercise, still remains very much in dispute (is the theory wrong, are the concepts and assumptions wrong, is the interpretation of the concepts wrong, is there <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the model and the real world, etc.). The math of the classical transformation problem is rather simple; the real difficulty is about whether the economic relationships involved are adequately conceptualized, and how we could know that. Both Marx and von Bortkiewicz implicitly admitted that assumptions (1), (3), (4) and (5) cannot be true in the real world, and this casts doubt on the importance or relevance of the classical transformation problem.|$|E

500|$|In 1635, a {{difficult}} situation occurred when senior pastor John Wilson returned from a lengthy trip to England {{where he had been}} settling his affairs.

In the case of odd torsion there are more precise results; in this case there is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> odd and even dimensional spheres. If p is an odd prime and n = 2i + 1, then elements of the p-component of πn+k(S'n) have order at most p'i [...] This is in some sense the best possible result, as these groups {{are known to have}} elements of this order for some values of k [...] Furthermore, the stable range can be extended in this case: if n is odd then the double suspension from πk(S'n) to πk+2(S'n+2) is an isomorphism of p-components if k < p(n + 1) − 3, and an epimorphism if equality holds [...] The p-torsion of the intermediate group πk+1(S'n+1) can be strictly larger.|$|E
500|$|In the pulpit, Wilson {{was said}} to have a voice that was harsh and indistinct and his {{demeanor}} was directed at strict discipline, but he had a penchant for rhymes, and would frequently engage in word play. [...] He was unpopular during his early days of preaching in Boston, partly attributable to his strictness in teaching, and partly from his violent and arbitrary manner. [...] His gruff style was further highlighted by the mild qualities of John Cotton, with whom he shared the church's ministry. [...] When Wilson returned to Boston in 1635, Hutchinson was exposed to his teaching for the first time, and immediately saw <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> her own doctrines and his. [...] She found his emphasis on morality, and his doctrine of [...] "evidencing justification by sanctification" [...] (a covenant of works) to be repugnant, and she told her followers that Wilson lacked [...] "the seal of the Spirit." [...] Wilson's doctrines were shared with all of the other ministers in the colony, except for Cotton, and the Boston congregation had grown accustomed to Cotton's lack of emphasis on preparation [...] "in favor of stressing the inevitability of God's will." [...] The positions of Cotton and Wilson were matters of emphasis, and neither minister believed that works could help to save a person. [...] It is likely that most members of the Boston church could not see much difference between the doctrines of the two men, but the astute Hutchinson could, prompting her to criticize Wilson at her home gatherings. [...] Probably in early 1636 he became aware of divisions within his own Boston congregation, and soon came to realize that Hutchinson's views were widely divergent from those of the orthodox clergy in the colony.|$|E

25|$|So proto-insects had to {{specialize}} and focus their whole existence on improving a single lifestyle {{in a particular}} niche. The older the species and the single individuals became, the more would they differ from their original form as they adapted to their new lifestyles better than the generations before.

In the current paper, the role different filtering methods might play in an identity processing task is examined for young and old adults, both taken from student populations. Contrary to most findings in the field of developmental face perception, only a near-significant age effect is apparent in upright and un-manipulated presentation of stimuli, whereas <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> age groups can be observed for a condition which removes all but horizontal information of a face.

40|$|Abstract: A type of Q 125 grade {{high-strength}} low carbide {{oil tube}} steel {{was designed and}} researched. The strengthening mechanism of the steel was analyzed by SEM and TEM, and the CO 2 corrosion behavior of the steel was simulated by high-temperature and high-pressure autoclave. The result show: the size of original austenite grain, packet and block are about 10 - 15 µm, 2 µm and 200 nm, respectively, so {{the strength of the}} steel matched toughness well. The precipitate of (Nb,Ti) (C,N) whose size is about 60 nm can restrain coarsening of the original austenite grain through pitting austenite grain boundary; The precipitate of (Nb,Ti) C and nanometer sized precipitate of NbC can be an effective barrier for dislocation motion, so that has great contributions to improve the strength of the steel. The average and pitting corrosion rate increased first and then dropped down with the increasing of temperature. There is a maximum of average and pitting corrosion rate at 90 ℃; Simultaneously, when the temperature is 90 ˚C, there is <b>a</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> average corrosion rate and pitting corrosion rate...|$|R

30|$|The above {{frequency}} subband decomposition only {{applies to}} the Smt-LF mapping. For Smt-MF mapping, the minimum frequency resolution required is approx. 26.6 Hz at A 4 (f 0 = 440 Hz). Using N = 512 provides a minimum resolution of 31.25 Hz which is slightly larger than the required resolution for the lowest semitone frequencies. Note that in the present implementation of the Smt-MF, the first two tones (A 4 and A 4 #) will not be adequately resolved and therefore fall within a single FFT bin which will in turn be mapped to two adjacent channels because the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> them {{is less than the}} LF resolution (7.8 Hz). To preserve the starting frequency and approach CFs to Greenwood frequencies without having an empty channel, while having frequencies of (A 4 and A 4 #) semitones being in the same bin, it is suggested to activate the first two electrodes.

40|$|Glucocorticoids {{or their}} {{metabolites}} {{can be measured}} in several body fluids or excreta, including plasma, saliva, urine and faeces. In recent years the measurement of glucocorticoid metabolites (GCMs) in faeces has gained increasing attention, because of its suitability for wild populations. In horses, however, the group-specific enzyme immunoassay described so far has a limited practicability due to its complex extraction procedure. Therefore, we tested the applicability of other enzyme immunoassays for glucocorticoid metabolites. The present study clearly proved that an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for 11 -oxoaetiocholanolone using 11 -oxoaetiocholanolone- 17 -CMO: BSA (3 alpha, 11 -oxo-A EIA) as antigen showed high amounts of immunoreactive substances. Therefore it was possible to use just a small amount of the supernatant of a methanolic suspension of faeces. The results correlated well with the already described method for measuring GCMs in horse faeces, i. e. analysing the samples with an EIA after a two step clean up procedure of the samples (Merl et al. 2000). In addition, the 3 alpha, 11 -oxo-A EIA has the advantage of providing <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> baseline values and peak values after ACTH stimulation.
