Those contents, Bearcroft went on, sought to persuade the public that [...] "every man of age had a right to choose his own representative in Parliament". Erskine, in his reply, argued that the Dialogue was not libellous (it opened with a preface containing [...] "a solemn protest against all sedition"), and insisted that the jury had the right to decide what constituted libel: ...|$|E
500|$|Two further {{problems}} are apparent {{when considering the}} fraud theory {{in the context of}} half-secret trusts. Since the will mentions the trust, it is impossible for the trustee to deny the existence of the trust. Whether or not the intended beneficiaries can be ascertained, in case of inter vivo transaction, the trust-beneficiary cannot benefit personally and any meaning of fraud seems apparent because fraud requires an intention to act dishonestly. It appears to create an alternative route: the trustee may bring false oral testimony in favour of a third party who was not the intended beneficiary, a party that cannot benefit if the law did not uphold half-secret trusts in conclusion but it could operate without court's interference. Secondly, a half-secret trust ought to fail for uncertainty, being a trust with no terms, with a resulting trust to the residuary legatee. Under the rule of three uncertainties in private trust, half or fully secretly trust ought to fail because of lack of intentional element. Those in favour of its enforcement must therefore observe the imposition of resulting trust as required under three certainties rule, and the [...] "fraud" [...] theory seems insufficient to do so, since there is no sublet and significant impact for dishonest act and if otherwise fraud can be upheld; and therefore no conduct {{on the part of the}} trustee to warrant it. The deceased's intended disposition remains imperfectly constituted and the intended beneficiary's claim is thus weaker than the residuary legatee's. Whilst one response has been to suggest that whether a resulting trust or enforcement of the secret trust is most appropriate remedy is <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> courts, subsequent cases have typically defined the automatic resulting trust, as in this case, as operating as a matter of law and not <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> courts, and this should be settled by parliament legislation.|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dehors theory is based on detective drafting of the Wills Act. In particular, whilst the term [...] "will" [...] is commonly used to refer to a specific document, the WIlls Act is designed to cover almost all documents except rules on public trust and secret trust that are to take effect after the testator's death. Indeed, the formality requirements of the Wills Act created the need for a set of prima facie documents, like the one commonly referred to. Therefore, to refer to an arrangement as dehor the Wills Act because it is not a prima facie reference to the document is incorrect. The response has been to view the secret trust as a disposition inter vivos ("between the living") rather than testamentary under exception. Although the testator is unlikely to consider the trust having come into existence {{at the time of the}} will upon his death, whether a disposition is arguably though less convincingly regarded as an inter vivos is <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> courts as well as parliament. However, other types of inter vivos trust are incapable of binding after-acquired property or operating so as to, whether automatically, semi-automatically or no automatism at all, bind such property as and when it is received. No separate declaration of trust is required in the case of property acquired after the execution of a will for it to form part of a secret trust. Looking at the definition of a [...] "testamentary disposition" [...] and [...] "inter vivo trust" [...] as applied in other sorts of cases is inconclusive.|$|E
