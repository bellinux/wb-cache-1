25|$|In the 1919 Cost Accounting Nicholson and Rohrbach again {{deal with}} the admittedly {{controversial}} {{question as to whether}} it is proper to treat normal interest return on passive investment as a part of manufacturing costs, the position is taken that interest on fixed assets should be so charged, but not interest on floating capital investment. The charging of some interest item is considered necessary to the successful distribution of overhead. Or, more exactly, normal return on passive investment is regarded as overhead to be distributed among the factory products. The authors in chapter IV considers that the opposition argument is directed chiefly at the practice of making these charges as part of the regular costs, not at the mere calculation thereof for use in statistical report form in the quotation of prices. He therefore suggests (p.140) an <b>accounting</b> <b>procedure</b> supposed to meet this objection.|$|E

50|$|The growth <b>accounting</b> <b>procedure</b> {{proceeds}} as follows. First {{is calculated}} the growth {{rates for the}} output and the inputs by dividing the Period 2 numbers with the Period 1 numbers. Then the weights of inputs are computed as input shares of the total input (Period 1). Weighted growth rates (WG) are obtained by weighting growth rates with the weights. The accounting result is obtained by subtracting the weighted growth rates of the inputs from {{the growth rate of}} the output. In this case the accounting result is 0.015 which implies a productivity growth by 1.5%.|$|E

In the Marxian interpretation, many of these rents, insofar as they are paid out of the sales of current output of production, constitute {{part of the new}} value created and part of the real cost structure of production. They should therefore be included in the valuation of the net product. This contrasts with the conventional national <b>accounting</b> <b>procedure,</b> where many property rents are excluded from new value-added and net product on the ground that they do not reflect a productive contribution.|$|E

The procedure {{was introduced by}} V. V. Chari, Patrick Kehoe and Ellen McGrattan but is similar to techniques introduced earlier. The underlying premise of the procedure is that the economy has a long run trajectory which is perturbed by various frictions. These are called wedges and the earliest version of the procedure includes a productivity wedge, a labor wedge, an investment wedge and a government consumption wedge. Business cycle accounting decomposes fluctuations in macroeconomic variables, such as GDP or employment, into fluctuations {{of each of these}} wedges (and their combinations).|$|E

A more practical approach is to assume net metering by each utility. Net metering is simply an <b>accounting</b> <b>procedure,</b> and the only requirement is a bi-directional electric meter. Most meters are bi-directional. It is more practical for utilities to discover net metering instead of requiring registration and reporting, just as there is no registration or reporting requirement in connecting an air conditioner, which is instead discovered by utilities. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kilowatt credits instead of converting to a monetary value.|$|E
