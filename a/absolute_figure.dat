To ensure the incorporation of the full labour demand, each of these single demands encompasses the realised (actual hires) and unrealised (unfulfilled vacancies) part of the labour category. To ensure comparability between different companies, it is possible to analyse this information by adjusting the figures according to a firm’s size and use the total demand shares met through each channel, which amount to 100 % of the total (or a value of 1). The studied demand-meeting options are thus viewed as interdependent and hence require simultaneous analysis.|$|E

40|$|Like all {{contaminants}} in potable water, the procedures used to remove manganese should aim {{at a fixed}} value in the finished water, preferably less than 10 μg L - 1. It has been surprising to us {{that so much of}} the R&D work reviewed for this chapter dealt with percentage removal, and we point out that on the above <b>absolute</b> <b>figure,</b> 95 % removal from water with more than 110 μg L - 1 of manganese will not meet the criterion. Dam destratification or various oxygenation techniques will convert soluble manganese into insoluble forms, although it may not reduce the overall total manganese entering the treatment plant. Changes in other parameters, e. g. algal growth and variety, associated with in-dam processes should be considered before proceeding down this line of approach. Procedures for in-plant manganese removal will be virtually essential if manganese is present in the dam water, even if dam manipulation is used. The best and probably most economical approaches for successful removal appear to lie in adding oxidant to the water entering the filtration beds. However, there may be sound reasons for adding oxidant earlier in the process. Obviously, where any form of membrane filtration is used, the addition of oxidant may be unnecessary and even counter-productive...|$|E

The {{goal of this}} paper is to extend the problem of finding the densest geodesic ball (or sphere) packing for the other 3 -dimensional homogeneous geometries (Thurston geometries),,,,, where a transitive symmetry group of the ball packing is assumed, one of the discrete isometry groups of the considered space.

40|$|Buildings are {{responsible}} for at least 40 % of energy used in most Countries. The <b>absolute</b> <b>figure</b> is rising fast, as construction booms, especially in developing countries including Malaysia. Since energy consumption is identified {{as one of the}} major cause in climate change issues, effort to reduce energy consumption in building is considered an important strategy. Energy conservation in building can be achieved through three strategies; i. e.; the physical design of the building; through electrical equipment used in the building; and the behaviour of the building users. This report discusses the study done on building user behaviour and practices in Energy Conservation. It is essential to investigate the status of awareness, knowledge and practices among building users because building users determine the pattern of energy consumption. Government of Malaysia has been actively developing policies, initiatives and programs in energy conservation not only to improve Energy Efficiency practices in the country but also in combating global warming through the reduction of fossil fuel consumption in building sector. Government also set 10 % reduction target of energy consumption in all government building in 2006. However the response by the public is still slow. This report presents the investigation carried out on the level of awareness and practices among government employees. The survey has been carried out on employee to examine the level of understanding and the initiatives organised in government offices. The results show that, up to 70 % of government employee understand about energy and 85 % understand EE, however practices on energy conservation individually and collectively are still low (about 50 %). This can be the reason why the program initiated by the government cannot be implemented successfully. Other reason for the low EE practice is {{due to the lack of}} initiative and program within the organisation/department.

40|$|It was Hegel who {{coined the}} phrase used {{in the title of}} this article, namely of quanti-tative {{accumulation}} and qualitative jump. 160 years after Hegel's death and three years {{after the fall of the}} Berlin Wall it is high time to rehabilitate his original idea, an idea which, misappropriated by Karl Marx to justify the revolution of the working class, has fallen into disrepute. For as we now know, the adoption of Hegel's idea could not prevent the flagrant falsi-fication of Marx's hypotheses in that large-scale real-life test called Eastern Europe. Hegel's phrase, however, perfectly fits the current situation of the insurance industry- a parallel which, we may rightly assume, would at the time have seemed highly improbable both to the man {{who coined the}} phrase and to the one who misappropriated it. Quantitative accumulation In 1987 direct insurance premiums worldwide passed the $US 1, 000 billion marks for the first time. By 1990 the total was already $US 1, 355 billion. This is an impressive figure and pretty close to the total gross national product of the Federal Republic of Germany, the third largest country worldwide in terms of GNP.

40|$|Tourism {{has become}} the number one {{industry}} in many countries representing the fastest growing economic sector in terms of job creation, foreign exchange earnings, and accounting for a significant share of their gross domestic product. Due to the economic impact, effective tourism planning has become vital for many destination countries. A primary tool for effective planning is accurate forecasts of tourism demand and impacts. To improve tourism forecasting accuracy, previous studies have included the effects of factors such as disasters, international politics, advertising effects, and other non-economic events. Until recently, econometric forecasting models have not taken into account {{the impact of a}} destinations image on tourism demand. Destination image is widely accepted as important for tourism development as destinations strive to be perceived as a safe, clean, friendly place to visit. Perceived image, has traditionally been considered a qualitative factor, with quantification efforts limited to focused studies of specific events or time points. The Dynamic Destination Image Index (DDII) was proposed by Stepchencova (2009) as a continuous proxy for the perceived image of a destination in an origin country. The measure of image proposed in Stepchencova (2009) represents a method of deriving a continuous measure of destination image from newspapers in origin countries. Content analysis was used to evaluate and quantify news articles about destination countries appearing in newspapers widely circulated in the tourism generating country. Since the index uses daily media sources over an extensive period of time, the DDII presents destination image as a numeric time-series-based data and <b>absolute</b> <b>figure,</b> and can be applied in an econometric model as an independent variable to improve the R-square value of the model. ^ This study utilized the DDII methodology to determine if the activities of a country with close geopolitical ties to a destination country {{have a significant impact on}} tourism demand. The DDII of North Korea in the US market was created for inclusion in an econometric model developed to estimate tourism demand for South Korea from the US. Unlike Stepchenkova’s study that demonstrate how changes in the destination image of Russia influence that country’s inbound tourism, this research investigated how the image of a neighboring country (North Korea) can impact the level of visitation to a destination country (South Korea). News articles about North Korea, published in the US market, were analyzed to construct DDII-North Korea, which was then added to the forecasting model of US arrivals to South Korea. The model including the DDII of North Korea was compared to the base model which included income, price, past tourist arrivals, seasonality and dummy variables for specific events such as Sep 11 th terrorist attack. This research found that including the DDII-North Korea significantly improved the fit of the base model, with the impact being of the direction and magnitude expected. It does appear that the activities of North Korea significantly affect the level of US visitation to South Korea. The coefficient of the model with DDII indicated that an increase of 10 index units (ranged from 0 to 100) is associated with 440 US visitors to South Korea per month. This finding on the monthly variations of the US arrivals quantifies the effects of a previously accepted but untested concept and should be useful for tourism planners in general and in South Korea specifically. ...|$|E
