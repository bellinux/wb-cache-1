40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for predicting the radiant heat flux distribution {{produced by a}} reflected bank of tungsten-filament tubular-quartz radiant heaters. The method is correlated with experimental results from two cases, one consisting of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> and <b>a</b> flat reflector and the other consisting of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> and <b>a</b> parabolic reflector. The simulation methodology, computer implementation, and experimental procedures are discussed. Analytical refinements necessary for comparison with experiment are discussed and applied to a multilamp, common reflector heating system...|$|R
50|$|To {{produce a}} {{complete}} television, the shutter assembly {{is combined with}} control electronics and backlight. The backlight for small sets can be provided by <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> using <b>a</b> diffuser or frosted mirror to spread out the light, but for larger displays <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> is not bright enough and the rear surface is instead covered {{with a number of}} separate lamps. Achieving even lighting over the front of an entire display remains a challenge, and bright and dark spots are not uncommon.|$|R
60|$|Luca Lomi himself {{opened the}} door. He drew Father Rocco hurriedly {{into the studio}} toward <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> burning on <b>a</b> stand near the {{partition}} between the two rooms.|$|R
50|$|Lampadomancy was {{a popular}} method of divination in ancient Egypt, where diviners would perform it at midday in a darkened room {{illuminated}} by <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> filled with oasis oil.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the dead}} of night, <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> burned in the chamber, which opened into an arched gallery that descended by a flight of steps into the gardens of the Serail.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for predicting the radiant heat flux distribution {{produced by a}} bank of quartz radiant heaters which accounts for the specular and diffuse effects of a flat reflector or the diffuse effects of individual parabolic reflectors. This analysis is experimentally verified for <b>a</b> <b>single</b> unreflected <b>lamp</b> and <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> with <b>a</b> flat reflector. Observations on the further development of this analysis and experimental validation are discussed...|$|R
25|$|The film {{must be in}} colour. Special {{lighting}} is not acceptable. (If there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> {{be attached to the}} camera).|$|R
50|$|Combination HPS/MH lights {{combine a}} metal halide and a {{high-pressure}} sodium {{in the same}} bulb, providing both red and blue spectrums in <b>a</b> <b>single</b> HID <b>lamp.</b> The combination of blue metal halide light and red high-pressure sodium light {{is an attempt to}} provide a very wide spectrum within <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp.</b> This allows for <b>a</b> <b>single</b> bulb solution throughout the entire life cycle of the plant, from vegetative growth through flowering. There are potential tradeoffs for the convenience of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> bulb in terms of yield. There are however some qualitative benefits that come for the wider light spectrum.|$|R
6000|$|Except for <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> {{near the}} bed, {{the place was}} unlighted, but by the fire, its glow falling on her white-draped form and pale, {{uncommon}} face, sat Stella. As he entered she rose, and, coming forward, accompanied him to the bedside, saying, in an earnest voice: ...|$|R
6000|$|... [96-102] large hall {{where not}} even <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> glimmered. It was made half visible by the wan phosphoric rays which {{proceeded}} from inscriptions on the walls, in {{letters of the}} same pale and sepulchral light. I could read them, methought; but though {{each one of the}} words 1817.|$|R
60|$|Before he {{was fairly}} {{aware of his}} attendant's meaning Serviss found himself thrust through a heavily curtained archway into a large room dimly lighted by <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> at the farther end. It {{contained}} about twenty people, and he hesitated in embarrassment and some amazement at the threshold.|$|R
60|$|John Strangewey ushered his {{companion}} into the square, oak-paneled hall, hung with many trophies of the chase, a few oil-paintings, {{here and there}} some sporting prints. It was lighted only with <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> which stood upon a round, polished table {{in the center of}} the white-flagged floor.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for predicting the radiant heat flux distribution produced by tungsten filament, tubular fused-quartz envelope heating systems with reflectors. The method is {{an application of}} Monte Carlo simulation, which {{takes the form of}} a random walk or ray tracing scheme. The method is applied to four systems of increasing complexity, including <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> without <b>a</b> reflector, <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> with <b>a</b> Hat reflector, <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> with <b>a</b> parabolic reflector, and up to six lamps in a six-lamp contoured-reflector heating unit. The application of the Monte Carlo method to the simulation of the thermal radiation generated by these systems is discussed. The procedures for numerical implementation are also presented. Experiments were conducted to study these quartz heating systems and to acquire measurements of the corresponding empirical heat flux distributions for correlation with analysis. The experiments were conducted such that several complicating factors could be isolated and studied sequentially. Comparisons of the experimental results with analysis are presented and discussed. Good agreement between the experimental and simulated results was obtained in all cases. This study shows that this method can be used to analyze very complicated quartz heating systems and can account for factors such as spectral properties, specular reflection from curved surfaces, source enhancement due to reflectors and/or adjacent sources, and interaction with a participating medium in a straightforward manner...|$|R
50|$|The halt {{was opened}} in 1908. It {{was a very}} basic affair, being without a platform, and {{consisting}} just of a fenced enclosure and a signboard, though did {{have the benefit of}} <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp.</b> When the line was built through the location, an ancient motte was damaged by the building work.|$|R
60|$|Silently, {{he strode}} into the apartment, a small {{antechamber}} off a large hall. At one end was an open hearth upon which logs were burning brightly, while <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> aided in diffusing a soft glow about the austere chamber. In {{the center of the}} room was a table, and at the sides several benches.|$|R
50|$|Lampadomancy {{is a form}} of divination using <b>a</b> <b>single</b> oil <b>lamp</b> or <b>a</b> torch flame.|$|R
50|$|Each lamp must be {{returned}} to one of several lamp racks in the kingdom. As the player can only carry <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> at <b>a</b> time, this can mean a lot of traveling back and forth. Once all the lamps have been returned to the rack, the level is complete, and the player advances to the next level.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} is a {{laser head}} for simultaneous pumping several dye lasers with <b>a</b> <b>single</b> flash <b>lamp.</b> The laser head includes primarily a multi-elliptical cylinder cavity with <b>a</b> <b>single</b> flash <b>lamp</b> placed along the common focal {{axis of the}} cavity and with capillary tube dye cells placed along {{each of the other}} focal axes of the cavity. The inside surface of the cavity is polished. Hence, the <b>single</b> flash <b>lamp</b> supplies the energy to the several dye cells...|$|R
60|$|They {{walked through}} the archway into an {{antechamber}} lit by <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp,</b> leaving Stephanus still occupied with his bolts and chains. Here with a sudden motion Nehushta threw off her cloak and tore the veil from her brow. In another instant, uttering a low, crooning cry, she flung her long arms about Miriam and began to kiss her again and again on the face.|$|R
50|$|The light {{originally}} used eleven wicks and reflectors, but in 1855 {{a fourth}} order Fresnel lens with <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> was substituted, with the lantern upgraded in 1867 {{to fit the}} new lens better. The lighting arrangements were upgraded several times over the years, with electrification coming in 1942. Its automation in 1947 brought about the retirement of Fannie Salter, the last woman lighthouse keeper in the United States.|$|R
50|$|The {{causeway}} {{is supported}} by three arches on the eastern side, while thirty-eight arches support it on the western side. It was built {{at a cost of}} Â£3,333. A local tradition states that the bridge was built by the Jesuits in <b>a</b> <b>single</b> night using the light of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp.</b> On 22 June 1634, the bridge, as well as the surrounding land was handed over to the municipal chamber of the city for its maintenance and upkeep.|$|R
5000|$|Were hosts at the Awards Tecnox 2015 (Latin American Students Applying Technologies). Its {{function}} was {{to conduct the}} ceremony sandwiching comedy acts. However, minutes before the start, a blackout surprised all the Aula Magna of the Faculty of Natural Sciences where prizes were given. True to {{the style of the}} group took the situation with humor and conducted the ceremony illuminated by <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp,</b> cell and <b>a</b> pair of lanterns lit from the public.|$|R
60|$|We all {{had good}} reason to join in the aspiration; for our vigil was a long and bitter one. Slowly the shadows darkened over the long, sombre face of the old house. A cold, damp reek from the moat chilled us to the bones and set our teeth chattering. There was <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> over the gateway and a steady globe of light in the fatal study. Everything else was dark and still.|$|R
50|$|Pumping with <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> {{tends to}} focus {{most of the}} energy on one side, {{worsening}} the beam profile. It is common for rods to have a frosted barrel, to diffuse the light, providing a more even distribution of light throughout the rod. This allows more energy absorption throughout the gain medium for a better transverse mode. A frosted flow tube or diffuse reflector, while leading to lowered transfer efficiency, helps increase this effect, improving the gain.|$|R
60|$|The Jew {{was evidently}} too {{familiar}} with the ground he traversed to be at all bewildered, either by {{the darkness of the}} night, or the intricacies of the way. He hurried through several alleys and streets, and at length turned into one, lighted only by <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> at the farther end. At the door of a house in this street, he knocked; having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it, he walked upstairs.|$|R
50|$|The {{lighting}} {{used for}} reef aquariums {{is the highest}} intensity of all aquarium types. Typical light sources types include LED, fluorescent, metal halide, and sometimes plasma lamps. Simple lighting setups use <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> or multiple <b>lamps</b> of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> type. More advanced setups can include several lamp types and can also include lamps of different colours. Lamp colour {{plays an important role}} in reef aquarium lighting for both aesthetic preference and to optimally sustain the photosynthetic life within the aquarium. Many corals require a deep blue or actinic spectrum of light to thrive.|$|R
25|$|Where {{junction}} {{indicators are}} unsuitable, route indicators {{are also used}} in colour-light areas. They may {{take the form of}} a dot-matrix of white lamps, or, in more recent installations, fibre-optic displays driven from <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> to display the route code. At certain locations, no route indication is given for the highest-speed route. As with semaphore route indicators, they are usually restricted to areas where all routes are at low speed, often on the approach or departure from large stations.|$|R
5000|$|Realizing {{that these}} lamps were such an {{important}} fixture of the nomadic Eskimo household that [...] "when the family moved the lamp went along with it", Arctic explorer William Parry (1790 - 1855) commented: The fire belonging to each family consists of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> or shallow vessel of lapis ollaris, its form being the lesser segment of a circle. The wick, composed of dry moss rubbed between the hands until it is quite inflammable, is disposed {{along the edge of}} the lamp...|$|R
25|$|Proponents of twin rear {{fog lamps}} say two lamps provide vehicle {{distance}} information not available from <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp.</b> Proponents of the <b>single</b> rear fog <b>lamp</b> say dual {{rear fog lamps}} closely mimic the appearance of illuminated stop lamps (which are mandatorily installed in pairs), reducing the conspicuity of the stop lamps' message when the rear fogs are activated. To provide some safeguard against rear fog lamps being confused with stop lamps, UN Regulation 48 requires a separation of at least 10cm between the closest illuminated edges of any stop lamp and any rear fog lamp.|$|R
50|$|In 1878 the world's first {{hydroelectric}} power scheme was developed at Cragside in Northumberland, England by William George Armstrong. It {{was used to}} power <b>a</b> <b>single</b> Arc <b>lamp</b> in his art gallery.|$|R
25|$|In {{the past}} use {{was made of}} {{searchlight}} signals; these have <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> in front of which is placed either a red, yellow or green filter to show the respective aspect. The filter assembly is moved by an electro-magnet. For a double-yellow aspect a second lamp is fitted, illuminated only when required. A few traditional searchlight signals (i.e. with moving glasses inside) remain in use in the Clacton area, but the concept had a renaissance in the 2000âs {{with the advent of}} LEDs which can show three different colours.|$|R
6000|$|The Chevalier nodded haughtily. The man preceded him by devious, narrow {{ways and}} dark staircases, coming {{abruptly}} upon {{a small apartment}} where the Princess sat on a low divan. <b>A</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> inclosed in <b>an</b> ominous wire cage flared above her. Strange things lay about the floor and shelves, and from another door he could see hideous masks, frightful heads, and disproportionate faces. He shuddered slightly, but recovered himself and fell on his knees before her. [...] "I lofe you," [...] he said madly. [...] "I have always lofed you!" ...|$|R
60|$|The Count halted, {{putting down}} my bags, closed the door, and {{crossing}} the room, opened another door, which led {{into a small}} octagonal room lit by <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>lamp,</b> and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a welcome sight. For here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log fire, also added to but lately, for the top logs were fresh, which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the door.|$|R
