40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{association}} of body mass index (BMI) and weight gain with <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> restaurants and similar establishments or <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> work among 10 European countries of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. SUBJECTS: This study included a representative sample of 24, 310 randomly selected EPIC participants. METHODS: Single 24 -h dietary recalls with information on the place of consumption were collected using standardized procedures between 1995 and 2000. Eating at restaurants was defined to include all eating and drinking occasions at restaurants, cafeterias, bars and fast food outlets. Eating at work included all eating and drinking occasions at the workplace. Associations between <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> restaurants or <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> work and BMI or annual weight changes were assessed using sex-specific linear mixed-effects models, controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: In southern Europe energy intake at restaurants was higher than intake at work, whereas in northern Europe <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> work appeared to contribute more to the mean daily intake than <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> restaurants. Cross-sectionally, <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> restaurants was found to be positively associated with BMI only among men (β=+ 0. 24, P= 0. 003). Essentially no association was found between BMI and <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> work among both genders. In a prospective analysis among men, <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> restaurants was found to be positively, albeit nonsignificantly, associated with weight gain (β=+ 0. 05, P= 0. 368). No association was detected between energy intake at restaurants and weight changes, controlling for total energy intake. CONCLUSION: Among men, <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> restaurants and similar establishments was associated with higher BMI and possibly weight gain...|$|R

In his biography, Chrisye noted that he enjoyed eating at roadside foodstalls well after his marriage and would be perplexed when people stared at him.

He thought that the menu was over complicated, and not all the elements of the dishes worked together. Gillian Glover of The Scotsman thought in 2005 that some of the food served was forgettable, but stand out elements included frog leg lolipops which came with her main course of baked seabass with garlic puree.|$|E

50|$|Lunch, the {{abbreviation}} for luncheon, {{is a light}} meal typically <b>eaten</b> <b>at</b> midday. The origin of the words lunch and luncheon relate to a small snack originally <b>eaten</b> <b>at</b> {{any time of the}} day or night. During the 20th century the meaning gradually narrowed to a small or mid-sized meal <b>eaten</b> <b>at</b> midday. Lunch is commonly the second meal of the day after breakfast. The meal varies in size depending on the culture, and significant variations exist in different areas of the world.|$|R

25|$|The {{city had}} many more modest restaurants, where one could dine for 1.50 francs, without wine. Employees with small {{salaries}} could find many restaurants which served a soup and main course, with bread and a carafe of wine, for between fifteen and twenty-one francs a week, with two courses with bread and a carafe. For {{students in the}} Left Bank, there were restaurants like Flicoteau, on rue de la Parcheminerie, which had no tablecloths or napkins, where diners <b>ate</b> <b>at</b> long tables with benches, and the menu consisted of bowls of bouillon with pieces of meat. Diners usually brought their own bread, and paid five or six centimes for their meal.|$|E
25|$|There {{were reports}} of drunken grave-diggers making graves for Ebola {{patients}} too shallow, {{and as a}} result wildlife came and dug up and <b>ate</b> <b>at</b> the corpses. In addition, in some cases bodies were not buried for days, because no one came to collect them. One problem was that it was hard to care for local health care workers, and there was not enough money to evacuate them. Meanwhile, other diseases like malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea were not being treated properly because the health system was trying to deal with Ebola patients. On 7 October 2014 Canada sent a C-130 loaded with 128,000 face shields to Freetown.|$|E
25|$|Using {{proceeds}} {{from the sale of}} her first three restaurants, Murphy invested one million dollars into the construction of her largest Candlelight restaurant in affluent Westchester County. Built on ten acres of land in Yonkers, with award-winning gardens a large parking lot and an artificial lake, the Westchester Candlelight was said to be the largest restaurant in the East. It seated almost a thousand customers while nearly as many were often waiting for tables. Serving was continuous, and 10,000 customers sometimes <b>ate</b> <b>at</b> the restaurant on a single day, according to Murphy. Engineered to maximize sales, the Westchester Candlelight invited diners enduring long waits to stroll its extensive gardens, browse at a gift shop featuring Patricia Murphy-branded fragrances, and buy drinks at the bar or flowers in the greenhouses. Charter buses from upstate New York and Pennsylvania arrived regularly with tour groups.|$|E

25|$|When {{designing}} the museum, the Smithsonian utilized its experience with Mitsitam Café at the National Museum of the American Indian. That cafeteria {{had been established}} to familiarize museum-goers with the rich food heritage of indigenous peoples of the Americas. Mitsitam Café not only proved popular and won culinary awards, but made {{a substantial amount of}} profit. The idea of regional food stations came from Dr. Jessica B. Harris, a food scholar who researched the food of African Americans from the colonial era to the present and presented her research to the museum's scholarly committee in 2013. Albert Lukas, a supervising chef at Sweet Home Café, traveled the United States for two years to find recipes and interview home cooks and professional chefs. A committee of chefs, curators, and historians spent another two years working out the restaurant's concept, visual design, and menu (the latter of which was designed by executive chef Grant). The final menu was designed not only to showcase the kinds of food African Americans of different regions <b>ate</b> <b>at</b> different times in American history, but also to demonstrate the impact African Americans had on both home cooking and haute cuisine.|$|E
