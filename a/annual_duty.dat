50|$|Motor Tax (Irish: Cáin Mhótair) is an <b>annual</b> <b>duty</b> payable on motor {{vehicles}} (subject to exemptions) in Ireland {{for use in}} public places. A new system for new private cars was introduced on 1 July 2008 where the tax rates {{are based on the}} carbon dioxide emissions of the car while in operation. Prior to this, tax rates are assessed on engine displacement - this includes used imports first registered in their original country of sale before July 2008. Motorcycles are all taxed the same regardless of engine displacement, with a special rate for electrically powered cycles. For goods vehicles, commercial vehicles and PSVs it is based on weight or is a standardised fee. For taxation of cars with Wankel engines under the old size-based system, the actual engine displacement is multiplied by 1.5 so for example a Mazda RX-8 with a 1.3 litre rotary engine is taxed as a 1.8 litre car.|$|E

The International Energy Agency recently published the “Technology Roadmap: Electric and Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles” which describes the trends for electric vehicles up to 2050 (IEA, 2011).
