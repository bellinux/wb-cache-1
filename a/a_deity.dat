5|$|According to the {{dominant}} scholarly view during the late 19th {{and much of the}} 20th century, Roman religion was originally animistic, directed towards spirits associated with specific objects or activities which were only later perceived as gods with independent personal existence. Terminus, with his lack of mythology and his close association with a physical object, seemed a clear example of <b>a</b> <b>deity</b> who had developed little from such a stage.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{every nation}} has {{associated}} blood drinking {{with some kind}} of revenant or demon, or in some cases <b>a</b> <b>deity.</b> In India, for example, tales of vetālas, ghoul-like beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the Baitāl Pacīsī; a prominent story in the Kathāsaritsāgara tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one. Piśāca, the returned spirits of evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.|$|E

5|$|Human {{cultures}} have developed many {{views of the}} planet. Earth is sometimes personified as <b>a</b> <b>deity.</b> In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity, and by the mid-20th century, the Gaia Principle compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability. Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities.|$|E
5|$|Iravan is {{generally}} known as Aravan, also spelt as Aravaan in South India. He is revered as <b>a</b> <b>deity</b> in two southern Indian Hindu cults: the Kuttantavar cult (dedicated solely to Aravan), and {{the cult of}} Draupadi (Aravan's stepmother and Arjuna's wife). In his own cult, Aravan {{is also known as}} Kuttantavar (கூத்தாண்டவர்), originating from the legend of Kuttantavar killing the demon Kuttacuran. This name is sometimes spelled as Kuttandar, Khoothandavar or Koothandavar.|$|E

40|$|The almost {{infinite}} number of epithets applied to Egyptian deities attests to the complex and diverse nature of Egyptian gods. In general, epithets outline <b>a</b> <b>deity’s</b> character, describe his/her physical appearance and attributes, and give information about the cult. Epithets immediately follow the deity’s name and {{can be made up}} of several distinct components. In hymns and ritual scenes, epithets often occur in long strings. It is useful to distinguish between epithets that identify a unique aspect of <b>a</b> <b>deity’s</b> personality (“personal epithets”) and epithets that refer to a particular situation or activity (“situational epithets”); in the latter case, the epithet can be applied to multiple deities...|$|R

5|$|A large mound on {{the south}} side of the plaza was once the Temple of Jakawitz, <b>a</b> <b>deity</b> of the {{mountains}} and the patron of the Ajaw K'iche' lineage.

This structure was part of a complex that consisted of a patio enclosed by the temple on the northern side, a palace {{on the south}}ern side and a long building on the east. The Jakawitz complex has not been investigated archaeologically. Drawings by Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with four or five terraces.|$|E
5|$|Foxes {{and human}} beings lived close {{together}} in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may {{have as many as}} nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make offerings to them as to <b>a</b> <b>deity.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> {{vegetation}} <b>deity</b> is <b>a</b> nature <b>deity</b> whose disappearance and reappearance, or life, {{death and}} rebirth, embodies the growth cycle of plants. In nature worship, the <b>deity</b> can be <b>a</b> god or goddess {{with the ability}} to regenerate itself. <b>A</b> vegetation <b>deity</b> is often <b>a</b> fertility <b>deity.</b> The deity typically undergoes dismemberment (see sparagmos), scattering, and reintegration, as narrated in a myth or reenacted by a religious ritual. The cyclical pattern is given theological significance on themes such as immortality, resurrection, and reincarnation. Vegetation myths have structural resemblances to certain creation myths in which parts of a [...] being's body generate aspects of the cosmos, such as the Norse myth of Ymir.|$|R

5|$|Ganesha likely {{emerged as}} <b>a</b> <b>deity</b> {{as early as}} the 2nd century AD, but most {{certainly}} by the 4th and 5th centuries AD, during the Gupta period, although he inherited traits from Vedic and pre-Vedic precursors. Hindu mythology identifies him as the restored son of Parvati and Shiva of the Shaivism tradition, but he is a pan-Hindu god found in its various traditions. In the Ganapatya tradition of Hinduism, Ganesha is the supreme deity. The principal texts on Ganesha include the Ganesha Purana, the Mudgala Purana, and the Ganapati Atharvashirsa. Brahma Purana and Brahmanda Purana are other two Puranic genre encyclopedic texts that deal with Ganesha.|$|E
5|$|Images of Bhikshatana {{are found}} {{throughout}} Shaiva temples of South India, but are almost unknown in Northern India.

In South Indian temples, Bhikshatana is prescribed to be enshrined as an avarana-devata (<b>a</b> <b>deity</b> depicted on the circumambulatory path encircling the central shrine). Similarly in Orissan temples, Bhikshatana may be worshipped and depicted as parshva-devata (an attendant deity) or avarana-devata.|$|E
