5|$|In Scotland {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>revival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle {{in the late}} eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as part of the wider Gothic Revival movement, as new houses were built and {{existing}} buildings remodeled in the Gothic and Scots Baronial styles. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets and is among the first houses in the revived style. His son Robert Adam's houses in this style included Mellerstain and Wedderburn in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian, but it is most clearly seen at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, remodelled by Adam from 1777. These were largely conventional Palladian style houses that incorporated some external features of the Scots baronial style.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{just before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II, there was <b>a</b> <b>revival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hooped crinoline from designers such as Edward Molyneux, who put hoops in both day skirts and evening gowns, and Norman Hartnell, whose late 1930s Winterhalter-inspired crinoline designs for Queen Elizabeth were so successful that the Queen is popularly (if inaccurately) credited with having single-handedly brought crinolines back into fashion. Both as Queen, and as the Queen Mother, Elizabeth adopted the traditional bell-shaped crinoline as her signature look for evening wear and state occasions. The film Gone With The Wind, released in 1939, inspired the American fashion for prom dresses with crinolines in Spring 1940.|$|E
5|$|Mainstream, non-pornographic manga also {{frequently}} contains explorations {{of gender and}} sex roles, although usually for purposes of exoticism or comedy {{rather than in a}} realistic manner.

IS, a manga about two intersexual characters, won the 2007 Kodansha Manga Award in the girls' manga division. Class S is a genre of girl's fiction that tells stories about crushes between a female upperclassman and an underclassman. Maria-sama ga Miteru, a contemporary series which includes a manga adaptation, has been described as <b>a</b> <b>revival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Class S genre.|$|E
