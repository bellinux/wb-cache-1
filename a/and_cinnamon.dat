5|$|A common Palestinian dessert {{reserved}} {{only for}} Ramadan is qatayef, {{which could be}} provided by the numerous street vendors in several major Palestinian cities or towns as well as typical Palestinian households.

The result of the batter being poured into a round hot plate appears similar to pancakes, except only one side is cooked, then folded. The pastry is filled with either unsalted goat cheese or ground walnuts <b>and</b> <b>cinnamon.</b> It is then baked and served with a hot sugar-water syrup or sometimes honey.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} are meat and beans or rice simmered overnight on a hotplate or blech, or {{placed in a}} slow oven. Ashkenazi cholent usually contains meat, potatoes, barley and beans, and sometimes kishke, and seasonings such as pepper and paprika. Sephardi hamin contains chicken or meat, rice, beans, garlic, sweet or regular potatoes, seasonings such as turmeric <b>and</b> <b>cinnamon,</b> and whole eggs in the shell known as haminados.

Iraqi Jews prepare tebit, using chicken and rice.|$|E
5|$|The spores are smooth, roughly {{ellipsoid}} in shape, inequilateral {{when viewed}} in profile, and measure 7.6–10 by 3–3.4μm. They appear hyaline (translucent) to yellowish in a dilute solution of KOH, <b>and</b> <b>cinnamon</b> to pale ochraceous when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia are somewhat collapsed, hyaline, and 5–6μm thick. The cystidia are scattered, sometimes arranged in clusters (especially on the gill edge), usually with an ochraceous-brown content, but occasionally hyaline. They are club-shaped to somewhat cylindric and measure 34–60 by 10–13μm. The cuticle of the cap is an ixotrichodermium—a cellular arrangement where the outermost hyphae are gelatinous and emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, {{perpendicular to the}} cap surface. These hyphae are hyaline and narrowly cylindric, measuring 1.4–3μm in diameter. The stem surface is made of scattered bundles of caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are brown or sometimes hyaline in KOH, club-shaped to subcylindrical bundles interspersed among hyaline cells. These bundles are underlain by a layer of gelatinous, hyaline, vertically oriented and parallel hyphae that are shaped like narrow cylinders. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E

5|$|Turner marketed Real Adventures {{through a}} {{substantial}} diversity of products, considering its Quest campaign {{a role model}} for future shows. Galoob acquired figurine licensing rights in 1995 and created a product line of vehicles, figures, and Micro Machines for fall 1996 release. Turner felt that Galoob's commitment legitimized the Quest marketing plan, and next secured partnership with Pizza Hut and food retailers. Pillsbury included $3mail-in rebates for future Quest videos, display contests, and instant coupon offers on over 20million packages. Campbell Soup Company released six holographic miniature posters on the same number of SpaghettiOs cans; the posters were awarded in Converting in 1997. General Mills outfitted boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios <b>and</b> <b>Cinnamon</b> Toast Crunch with offers for T-shirts and other items. Over five thousand Pizza Hut restaurants held a two-month-long give-away of figurines with meals during the show's launch. Galoob failed to build popularity for its toys outside the United States, and discontinued the line in 1997.|$|E
