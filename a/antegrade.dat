25|$|Surgery may {{be carried}} out if {{conservative}} measures alone are not sufficient to control incontinence. There are many surgical options, and their relative effectiveness is debated {{due to a lack}} of good quality evidence. The optimal treatment regime may be a both surgical and non-surgical treatments. The surgical options can be considered in four categories: restoration and improvement of residual sphincter function (sphincteroplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, tibial nerve stimulation, correction of anorectal deformity), replacement / imitation of the sphincter or its function (anal encirclement, SECCA procedure, non-dynamic graciloplasty, perianal injectable bulking agents), dynamic sphincter replacement (artificial bowel sphincter, dynamic graciloplasty), <b>antegrade</b> continence enema (Malone procedure), and finally fecal diversion (e.g. colostomy). A surgical treatment algorithm has been proposed. Isolated sphincter defects (IAS/EAS) may be initially treated with sphincteroplasty and if this fails, the person can be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. Functional deficits of the EAS and/or IAS (i.e. where there is no structural defect, or only limited EAS structural defect, or with neurogenic incontinence) may be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. If this fails, neosphincter with either dynamic graciloplasty or artificial anal sphincter may be indicated. Substantial muscular and/or neural defects may be treated with neosphincter initially.|$|E

50|$|When {{solution}} is {{introduced into the}} aortic root (with an aortic cross-clamp on the distal aorta to limit systemic circulation), this is called <b>antegrade</b> cardioplegia. When introduced into the coronary sinus, it is called retrograde cardioplegia.|$|E
50|$|This {{procedure}} {{involves the}} surgical {{creation of a}} stoma (either an appendicostomy, cecostomy, or sigmoidostomy), which thereafter functions as an irrigation port. This <b>antegrade</b> colonic irrigation aims to introduce fluid to wash out the colon at regular intervals. The idea is to ensure regular emptying of the colon and rectum and hopefully, prevent involuntary loss of bowel content. The Malone <b>antegrade</b> continence enema (MACE) is where an appendicostomy is created, i.e. the vermiform appendix is stitched to the abdominal wall to form a stoma. ACE is often necessary in addition to others when FI is complicated by neuropathy and/or an incomplete IAS. Patients may have persistent leakage of fluid per rectum for several hours following the irrigation.|$|E

50|$|Percutaneous {{nephrostomy}} is an interventional radiology/surgical {{procedure in}} which the renal pelvis is punctured whilst using imaging as guidance. Images are obtained once an <b>antegrade</b> pyelogram (an injection of contrast), with a fine needle, has been performed. This contrast is used to show calcifications at the renal pelvis. A nephrostomy tube may then be placed to allow drainage.|$|E
50|$|Another {{variation}} on this concept {{is seen in}} atrial flutter. As {{a result of the}} rapid atrial rate, some of the atrial activity fails to get through the AV node in an <b>antegrade</b> direction but can alter the rate at which a subsequent atrial impulse is conducted. In this circumstance, an alteration in the F-wave to QRS relationship is seen.|$|E

5000|$|When {{describing}} the surgery, the Roux limb is the [...] or <b>antegrade</b> limb {{that serves as}} the primary recipient of food after the surgery, while the hepatobiliary or [...] limb that anastomoses with the biliary system serves as the recipient for biliary secretions, which then travel through the excluded small bowel to the distal anastomosis at the mid jejunum to aid digestion. The altered anatomy can contribute to indigestion following surgery.|$|E
50|$|Surgery {{involves}} {{making an}} incision between the anus and scrotum (perineal incision) and dissecting out the bulbar urethra and locating the scar and membranoprostatic urethra. Dissecting the bulbar urethra destroys the <b>antegrade</b> blood flow. However, this urethra still does well since in still gets retrograde blood {{flow from the}} dorsal arteries. When patients have erectile dysfunction, the dorsal arteries do not work well and therefore the bulbar urethra does not get a good blood supply.|$|E
50|$|For {{children}} who have a poor outcome for continence and constipation from the initial surgery, further surgery to better establish the angle between the anus and the rectum may improve continence and, for those with a large rectum, surgery to remove that dilated segment may significantly improve the bowel control for the patient. An <b>antegrade</b> enema mechanism can be established by joining the appendix to the skin (Malone stoma); however, establishing more normal anatomy is the priority.|$|E
5000|$|By {{dissecting}} animals, Fabricius {{investigated the}} formation of the fetus, the structure of the esophagus, stomach and intestines, and the peculiarities of the eye, the ear, and the larynx. He was the first to describe the membranous folds that he called [...] "valves" [...] in the interior of veins. These valves are now understood to prevent retrograde flow of blood within the veins, thus facilitating <b>antegrade</b> flow of blood towards the heart, though Fabricius did not understand their role at that time.|$|E
50|$|A pelvic {{fracture}} {{can cause}} the urethra to separate, leading to a variable length of scar that can severely hamper the ability to urinate normally. The urethra is a tubular conduit that transports urine out of the bladder. The bulbar urethra is {{a segment of the}} male urethra that is in between the penile urethra and the membrano-prostatic urethra that typically has a robust blood supply. This blood supply includes <b>antegrade</b> flow from the paired bulbar arteries and circumflex arteries, and retrograde flow from the paired dorsal arteries of the penis.|$|E

The transfemoral and transapical approach are now the two most common access routes used in TAVI today. He was appointed the McLeod Professor of Heart Valve Intervention in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Accelerated idioventricular rhythm is {{also the}} most common reperfusion {{arrhythmia}} in humans. However, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation remain the most important causes of sudden death following spontaneous restoration of <b>antegrade</b> flow. Prior to the modern practice of percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndrome, pharmacologic thrombolysis was more common and accelerated idioventricular rhythms were used as a sign of successful reperfusion. [...] It is considered a benign arrhythmia that does not require intervention, though AV dyssynchrony can cause hemodynamic instability, which can be treated through overdrive pacing or atropine.|$|E
50|$|Imaging studies, {{such as an}} {{intravenous}} urogram (IVU), ultrasound, CT or MRI, {{are also}} important investigations in determining the presence and/ or cause of hydronephrosis. Whilst ultrasound allows for visualisation of the ureters and kidneys (and determine the presence of hydronephrosis and / or hydroureter), an IVU is useful for assessing the anatomical location of the obstruction. <b>Antegrade</b> or retrograde pyelography will show similar findings to an IVU but offer a therapeutic option as well. Real-time ultrasounds and color-flow Doppler tests in association with vascular resistance testing helps determine how a given obstruction is effecting urinary functionality in hydronephrotic patients.|$|E
50|$|For the 15% of {{children}} who do not obtain full bowel control, other treatments are available. Constipation may be remedied by laxatives or a high-fiber diet. In those patients, serious dehydration can play {{a major factor in}} their lifestyles. A lack of bowel control may be addressed by a stoma, similar to a colostomy. The Malone <b>antegrade</b> colonic enema (ACE) is also an option. In a Malone ACE, a tube goes through the abdominal wall to the appendix, or if available, to the colon. The bowel is then flushed daily. Children as young as 6 years of age may administer this daily flush on their own.|$|E
50|$|The {{mainstay}} {{for medical}} management of uric acid stones is alkalinization (increasing the pH) of the urine. Uric acid stones {{are among the}} few types amenable to dissolution therapy, referred to as chemolysis. Chemolysis is usually achieved {{through the use of}} oral medications, although in some cases, intravenous agents or even instillation of certain irrigating agents directly onto the stone can be performed, using <b>antegrade</b> nephrostomy or retrograde ureteral catheters. Acetazolamide (Diamox) is a medication that alkalinizes the urine. In addition to acetazolamide or as an alternative, certain dietary supplements are available that produce a similar alkalinization of the urine. These include sodium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, magnesium citrate, and Bicitra (a combination of citric acid monohydrate and sodium citrate dihydrate). Aside from alkalinization of the urine, these supplements have the added advantage of increasing the urinary citrate level, which helps to reduce the aggregation of calcium oxalate stones.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveAntegrade {{cerebral}} perfusion {{is widely}} used in neonatal heart surgery, yet commonly used flow rates have never been standardized. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion flow rate that most closely matches standard cardiopulmonary bypass conditions. MethodsNine neonatal piglets underwent deep hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass at a total body flow of 100  mL/kg/min (baseline). <b>Antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion was conducted via innominate artery cannulation at perfusion rates of 10, 30, and 50 mL/kg/min in random order. Cerebral blood flow was measured using fluorescent microspheres. Regional oxygen saturation and cerebral oxygen extraction were monitored. ResultsCerebral blood flow was as follows: baseline, 60 ± 17 mL/ 100 g/min; <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion at 50  mL/kg/min, 56 ± 17 mL/ 100 g/min; <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion at 30 mL/kg/min, 36 ± 9 mL/ 100 g/min; and <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion at 10 mL/kg/min, 13 ± 6 mL/ 100 g/min. At an <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion rate of 50 mL/kg/min, cerebral blood flow matched baseline (P =. 87), as did regional oxygen saturation (P =. 13). <b>Antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion at 30 mL/kg/min provided approximately 60 % of baseline cerebral blood flow (P <. 002); however, regional oxygen saturation was equal to baseline (P =. 93). <b>Antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion at 10 mL/kg/min provided 20 % of baseline cerebral blood flow (P <. 001) and a lower regional oxygen saturation than baseline (P =. 011). Cerebral oxygen extraction at <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion rates of 30 and 50 mL/kg/min was equal to baseline (P =. 53,. 48) but greater than baseline (P <. 0001) at an <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion rate of 10 mL/kg/min. The distributions of cerebral blood flow and regional oxygen saturation were equal in each brain hemisphere at all <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion rates. ConclusionCerebral blood flow increased with <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion rate. At an <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion rate of 50 mL/kg/min, cerebral blood flow was equal to baseline, but regional oxygen saturation and cerebral oxygen extraction trends suggested more oxygenation than baseline. An <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion rate of 30 mL/kg/min provided only 60 % of baseline cerebral blood flow, but cerebral oxygen extraction and regional oxygen saturation were equal to baseline.

40|$|ObjectiveWith the {{realization}} that hypothermia was neuroprotective, hypothermic selective <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion was adopted by many surgical groups for aortic arch resection, prompting experimental and clinical studies to elaborate technical refinements and safe parameters of selective <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion. We review the evidence for optimum management of perfusion pressure, flow, temperature, pH, hematocrit, and cannulation access. MethodsUnderperfusion and overperfusion impair neurologic function after selective <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion. Overperfusion—including excessive flow and pressure—is expressed experimentally as an increase in intracranial pressure, indicative of cerebral edema, and causes slow neurobehavioral recovery. As the safe limits of moderate and mild hypothermic selective <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion are being explored in many aortic centers, the ischemic tolerance of the spinal cord during lower-body circulatory arrest becomes a new focus of concern. ResultsAlthough {{a significant portion of}} the population has an incomplete circle of Willis, contralateral flow via extracranial collaterals has permitted the successful use of various cannulation techniques. Unilateral perfusion is adequate for short-term (< 40 minutes) selective <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion, even at higher temperatures (24 °C- 28 °C). However, if prolonged periods of selective <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion are anticipated, evidence suggests that better cerebral protection is obtained with bilateral selective <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion. ConclusionsOn the basis of these experimental and clinical studies, certain recommendations for the use of nonpulsatile selective <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion can be made...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{assess the}} impact of using <b>antegrade</b> {{cerebral}} perfusion during aortic arch surgery on postoperative survival and neurologic outcomes. MethodsAll operations were performed at the same hospital between January 2001 and January 2009. Patients undergoing aortic arch surgery using <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion during deep hypothermia were compared with patients undergoing aortic arch surgery without <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion during the same study period. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards model were used to identify predictors of postoperative cerebrovascular accidents and midterm survival, respectively. There were 46 patients in the <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion group and 78 patients in the non-antegrade cerebral perfusion group. ResultsThere were no statistically significant differences in age, proportion of emergency operations, or proportion of type A aortic dissection between the 2 groups. There was a statistically significant and clinically important difference in the rates of postoperative cerebrovascular complications (2 % <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion vs 13 % non-antegrade cerebral perfusion, P = . 03), postoperative duration of mechanical ventilation (1. 15  ± 0. 19 days <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion vs 2. 13  ± 0. 38 days non-antegrade cerebral perfusion, P = . 02), and 3 -year survival (93 % <b>antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion vs 78 % non-antegrade cerebral perfusion, P = . 03). <b>Antegrade</b> cerebral perfusion was shown to be a significant predictor of reduced postoperative stroke rates and better survival at 3 years.
