5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> use ordinary events to create a connection {{in the mind of the}} reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E

DeMille's film Union Pacific, and even an inspection by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While the locomotives displayed excellent acceleration <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> maintain schedules better than conventional steam locomotives, they also demonstrated serious reliability problems and relatively high maintenance costs; they never entered regular revenue service.|$|E
5|$|Ant {{societies}} have division of labour, communication between individuals, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> solve complex problems. These parallels with human {{societies have}} long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas {{where they have been}} introduced accidentally.|$|E
5|$|On 25 August 2011, Challinor {{signed for}} Kettering's Conference Premier rivals York City on a {{contract}} until January 2012, having impressed manager Gary Mills when playing against York for Kettering two days earlier. He made his debut a day later, coming on as a 56th-minute substitute for Patrick McLaughlin in a 0–0 draw away to Fleetwood Town. Challinor was soon converted into a right back at York, a position in which he displayed composure <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> start attacking moves. His first goal for York came in a 4–2 win away to Hayes & Yeading United on 22 October 2011 with a drilled shot into the bottom {{right corner of the}} goal {{from the edge of the}} penalty area.|$|E

5|$|The Kerry Bog Pony is a {{mountain}} and moorland breed of pony that originated in Ireland. Possibly {{descended from the}} Irish Hobby horse, it originally lived a mainly feral existence in the peat bogs {{of what is now}} County Kerry in southwestern Ireland. Local inhabitants used the ponies as pack and cart horses for transporting peat and kelp to the villages. The breed developed physical characteristics including a low weight-to-height ratio and an unusual footfall pattern, which helped it move on soft ground such as peat bogs. The ponies were known for hardiness <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> survive in harsh conditions.|$|E
5|$|The RAN {{conducted}} armament effectiveness {{studies of}} each of the six DDL variants in parallel with Y-ARD's development of the designs. These studies found that including an area air defence capability <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> operate two helicopters greatly improved the DDL's effectiveness. As a result, these features were included in the Navy's specification for the DDL design which was issued in late 1970. By this time the design had evolved to specify a general-purpose destroyer of 4,200 tons, armed with a five-inch gun and a Tartar missile launcher, and capable of operating two helicopters. The changes increased the cost of building the ships, and the number planned was reduced to three. Nevertheless, the DDL design was considered likely to result in very capable ships, with the 1972–73 edition of Jane's Fighting Ships commenting favourably.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Trinidad in February 1924, when he scored 44 and 22 against British Guiana. He {{did not play}} for Trinidad again until 1926, when he faced the touring Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in two games without much success. Despite another unproductive match for Trinidad in January 1927, this time against Barbados, Roach was named in the Trinidad press later that year as a likely candidate to join the West Indies team to tour England in 1928. Already judged a leading batsman in Trinidad, other factors cited in his favour included his fielding, given that West Indian teams had been inconsistent in that discipline, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> bowl. That December, he passed fifty {{for the first time}} in first-class matches, when he scored 84 runs for a combined Trinidad and Guiana team. The latter match was played to assist in selecting a team for the forthcoming West Indian tour of England; Roach played a further two such games without success in early 1928. Even so, he was chosen in the touring party; previews again suggested his fielding and ability to bowl played a part in his selection. Meanwhile, he trained as a solicitor, and successfully took his examinations shortly before the tour began.|$|E

To reach an expected result, it is required to think logically on what to do and how to improve just like when using a computer.

25|$|This play {{portrays a}} family in a ferociously {{negative}} light as the parents and two sons express accusations, blame, and resentments – qualities which are often paired with pathetic and self-defeating attempts at affection, encouragement, tenderness, and yearnings for things to be otherwise. The pain of this family is made worse by their depth of self-understanding and self-analysis, combined with a brutal honesty, as they see it, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> boldly express themselves. The story deals with the mother’s addiction to morphine, the family’s addiction to whiskey, the father’s miserliness, the older brother’s licentiousness, and younger brother’s illness.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{of cooling}} {{has been shown to}} {{influence}} the frost resistance of tissues, but the actual rate of freezing will depend not only on the cooling rate, but also on the degree of supercooling and the properties of the tissue. Sakai (1979a) demonstrated ice segregation in shoot primordia of Alaskan white and black spruces when cooled slowly to 30nbsp&°C to -40nbsp&°C. These freeze-dehydrated buds survived immersion in liquid nitrogen when slowly rewarmed. Floral primordia responded similarly. Extraorgan freezing in the primordia accounts for the ability of the hardiest of the boreal conifers to survive winters in regions when air temperatures often fall to -50nbsp&°C or lower. The hardiness of the winter buds of such conifers is enhanced by the smallness of the buds, by the evolution of faster translocation of water, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> tolerate intensive freeze dehydration. In boreal species of Picea and Pinus, the frost resistance of 1-year-old seedlings is on a par with mature plants, given similar states of dormancy.|$|E

25|$|Regarded by some pundits, managers, and {{teammates}} {{as one of}} the greatest midfielders of his generation, Lampard was an all-round and versatile box-to-box player, who was capable of playing anywhere in midfield; throughout his career he was deployed as a central midfielder, as an attacking midfielder, as a defensive midfielder, and even as a supporting striker on occasion. A hard-working player, with notable stamina <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> read the game, Lampard was also capable of functioning creatively and starting attacking plays after winning back possession, due to his technique, vision, and passing range. In addition to his creative and defensive midfield roles, Lampard also possessed a keen eye for goal, due to his ability to make attacking runs into the area, or produce accurate and powerful shots from distance. These attributes enabled him to maintain a prolific goalscoring record throughout his career, despite his deep playing position. Lampard was also an accurate set-piece and penalty kick taker.|$|E
25|$|Eto'o is a fast, strong, and {{energetic}} forward, {{who is known}} for his stamina, work-rate, ability in the air, and his accurate finishing ability both with his head and feet. A powerful and prolific goalscorer with good technique, composure in front of goal, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> play off other forwards, Eto'o is primarily deployed as a central striker, although during his time at Inter, under José Mourinho, he demonstrated notable tactical intelligence and versatility by playing in several other positions on the pitch. During Inter's 2009–10 treble-winning season, Eto'o {{played an important role in}} the squad, and was utilised as a winger or even as an attacking midfielder in Mourinho's 4–2–3–1 formation, where he was primarily required to help his team creatively and defensively with his work-rate off the ball. During the return leg of the Champions League semi-final match against Barcelona, Eto'o demonstrated his workrate and versatility by playing as an attacking full-back following Thiago Motta's controversial sending-off. Eto'o has also been renowned for his leadership, opportunism and mentality throughout his career. In his prime, Eto'o was regarded by pundits as one of the best strikers in the world; he is currently regarded as one of the greatest African players of all time. Despite losing some of his speed with age, he continued to maintain a consistent goalscoring rate as a striker, due to his ability to get into good positions and time his attacking runs, as shown by his goal in a 6–3 loss against Chelsea on 30 August 2014, during his time with Everton. Despite his advancing age, Eto'o has maintained his dribbling skills in his later career, which he uses to his advantage to beat defenders and assist teammates.|$|E
