40|$|The {{job of a}} {{principal}} is becoming more demanding and more critical each year. Principals are asked to undertake huge challenges and to succeed regardless of what obstacles lie ahead. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify which <b>Administrative</b> <b>Task</b> Areas and Specific Task Areas caused the most difficulties for first- and second-year principals. ^ A survey was taken of first- and second-year principals in Dade County, Florida. These beginning principals rated their level of proficiency for each <b>administrative</b> <b>task</b> area and each specific task within those areas. Participants rated their perceptions on a scale from one to four. The data were analyzed based on frequency distributions, percentages, means, and standard deviations. ^ Beginning principals perceived themselves as least proficient in the <b>administrative</b> <b>task</b> areas of management and personnel duties. They believed their strongest areas were curriculum and instruction and school-community relations. Within these areas, the specific <b>administrative</b> <b>task</b> areas identified as most problematic were identifying proper procedures for construction in the schools, visiting classrooms to help teachers improve instruction, awareness of issues related to school law, establishing accounting procedures for the school 2 ̆ 7 s internal funds, and procedures for dismissing incompetent staff members. ^ Many beginning principals surveyed volunteered to make recommendations for future beginning principals. Of these recommendations, the most popular responses addressed obtaining more experience with the budget and internal funds prior to becoming {{a principal}}. In addition, there was a strong need for more training dealing with school personnel and the importance of networking with a veteran principal. ^ The principal training programs for five of the largest school districts in Florida were reviewed. These programs were found to incorporate a vast amount of the recommendations included in the literature. Florida is moving in the right direction toward excellence in the public schools. ...|$|R

5|$|When Geta died in 211, her {{responsibilities}} increased because Caracalla found <b>administrative</b> <b>tasks</b> to be mundane. She {{may have}} taken upon {{one of the more}} important civil functions of the emperor; receiving petitions and answering correspondence. The extent of her role in this position, however, is probably overstated. She may have represented her son and played a role in meetings and answering queries; however, the final authority on legal matters was Caracalla. When Caracalla was murdered, Julia was in Antioch sorting out correspondence, removing unimportant messages from the bunch so that when Caracalla returned, he would not be overburdened with duties. The emperor filled all of the roles in the legal system as judge, legislator, and administrator.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, in 1808, he {{was offered}} the {{position}} of First Squire of the Emperor in Napoleon's Military Household, a dignity that offered an annual revenue of 30,000 Francs and which gained importance when the Grand Squire, General Armand Augustin Louis de Caulaincourt, was sent to Saint-Petersburg as ambassador. Napoleon allegedly chose Nansouty for his elegant manners and education, aristocratic posture and talent for administration. In his capacity as First Squire, Nansouty thus had to accompany the Emperor during the latter's short campaign in Spain (from November 1808 to early January 1809). There, {{he was in charge}} of several <b>administrative</b> <b>tasks</b> linked with managing the Emperor's stable services and suite and commanding his orderly officers. The Emperor's aides-de-camp had their own aides-de-camp, who were also placed under the command of the First Squire. Although never very far away from the Emperor in a campaign that included many battles, Nansouty himself never exercised a field command during this campaign, and in January 1809, he accompanied his master back to France, as the outbreak of the War of the Fifth Coalition was imminent.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the 2/15th {{remained}} on Brunei until November when it moved to Mempakul as personnel {{were returned to}} Australia in drafts based on priority of discharge. A small group of personnel volunteered {{at this time to}} undertake occupation duties in Japan and were subsequently transferred to the 66th or 67th Battalions. In early December, the battalion's vehicles were returned and after the appropriate clearances were received, the remaining cadre was transported to Labuan. From there, they sailed back to Australia aboard the Pachaug Victory, arriving at Brett's Wharf, in Brisbane on 19 December. The cadre moved into a camp at Chermside, where they completed unloading of stores and equipment before a short Christmas leave. Early in the new year, the final <b>administrative</b> <b>tasks</b> were completed and the last group of personnel were posted for demobilisation and discharge. Finally, the 2/15th was officially disbanded on 21 January 1946.|$|E

5|$|The limited {{evidence}} on auxiliary centuriones and decuriones {{is that such}} officers could be directly commissioned as well as promoted from the ranks. Many appear {{to have come from}} provincial aristocracies. Those rising from the ranks could be promotions from the legions {{as well as from the}} regiment's own ranks. In the Julio-Claudian period auxiliary centuriones and decuriones were a roughly equal split between citizens and peregrini, though later citizens became predominant due to the spread of citizenship among military families. Because centuriones and decuriones often rose from the ranks, they have often been compared to warrant officers such as sergeants-major in modern armies. However, centurions' social role was much wider than a modern warrant-officer. In addition to their military duties, centurions performed a wide range of <b>administrative</b> <b>tasks,</b> which was necessary in the absence of an adequate bureaucracy to support provincial governors. They were also relatively wealthy, due to their high salaries (see table above). However, most of the surviving evidence concerns legionary centurions and it is uncertain whether their auxiliary counterparts shared their high status and non-military role.|$|E
5|$|After its {{removal from}} Operation Varsity, the {{division}} remained in reserve as the Allied armies advanced even further into Germany, moving to Oise, France, on 3 April for supply and <b>administrative</b> <b>tasks.</b> The division {{was scheduled to}} participate in several other airborne operations; however, these were all cancelled before they could take place. The first of these was Operation Arena, which envisioned landing between six and ten divisions into what was termed a 'strategic airhead' in the Kassel region of Northern Germany; the planners of the operations envisioned that the operation would deny a large swathe of territory to the German defenders and give the Allied armies a staging area for further advances into Germany. The 13th was chosen to participate, along with the 17th, 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and the British 6th and 1st Airborne Divisions. A preliminary date for 1 May was set for the operation once all of the required airborne and air-landed infantry divisions had been located and supplied, but it was ultimately cancelled on 26 March due to the rapid movement of Allied ground forces negating {{the need for the}} operation. Two other airborne operations were planned to include the 13th. Operation Choker II was to be an airborne landing on the east bank of the Rhine near Worms, Germany; planning for the operation got to an advanced stage, and the division was only hours from taking off from airfields in France when the operation was cancelled due to Allied ground forces overrunning the proposed landing areas. Operation Effective was designed to land the 13th south of Stuttgart, seize a nearby airfield and create an airhead for further forces to land in near the Black Forest. The operation was scheduled for 22 April, but was cancelled on 18 April due to Allied units encircling the Black Forest region and making it unnecessary.|$|E
