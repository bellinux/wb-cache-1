50|$|Sar RNA is an {{antisense}} non-coding RNA that {{is partly}} responsible for the negative regulation of <b>antirepressor</b> synthesis during development of bacteriophage P22. The target of Sar RNA is ant mRNA. Structurally, Sar RNA forms two stem-loops.|$|E
40|$|The immI operon of P 1 {{contains}} the genes c 4, icd (formerly called orfx), and ant which are constitutively transcribed {{in that order}} from a single promoter, P 51 b. C 4 is an antisense RNA which is processed from the precursor transcript. C 4 RNA acts as a translational repressor of icd, thereby also inhibiting <b>antirepressor</b> (ant) synthesis. We have cloned the icd and the overlapping icd and ant genes. We show, by means of plasmid deletion analysis, that icd is translationally coupled to ant. An internal in-frame deletion of icd making up 65 % of the codons still allows <b>antirepressor</b> synthesis at a reduced rate, indicating that a functionally active icd gene product is dispensable for ant expression. We identify {{the product of the}} icd gene as a 7. 3 -kDa protein which interferes with cell division. The results suggest that constitutive expression of icd, {{in the absence of a}} functionally active <b>antirepressor,</b> prevents P 1 lysogen formation because of its detrimental effect on the host cell...|$|E
40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} {{to show that the}} initiation of DNA replication in E. coli 555 - 7 requires synthesis of a protein whose production is correlated with total protein synthesis. Once replication is initiated, however, reinitiation will occur if all further protein synthesis is prevented; a small amount of protein synthesis is sufficient to prevent this unregulated reinitiation. This shows that the initiation of DNA replication is under negative control. A mechanism for the control of DNA replication is proposed; in this mechanism a replication repressor is synthesized periodically, while an <b>antirepressor</b> protein is synthesized continuously. Derepression of initiation results after sufficient accumulation of the <b>antirepressor</b> protein, and repression is re-established by repressor synthesis after the initiation of replication...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcal superantigen-carrying {{pathogenicity}} islands (SaPIs) are discrete, chromosomally integrated {{units of}} ~ 15 kilobases that are induced by helper phages to excise and replicate. SaPI DNA is then efficiently encapsidated in phage-like infectious particles, leading to extremely high frequencies of intra- {{as well as}} intergeneric transfer. In the absence of helper phage lytic growth, the island is maintained in a quiescent prophage-like state by a global repressor, Stl, which controls expression {{of most of the}} SaPI genes. Here we show that SaPI derepression is effected by a specific, non-essential phage protein that binds to Stl, disrupting the Stl–DNA complex and thereby initiating the excision-replication-packaging cycle of the island. Because SaPIs require phage proteins to be packaged, this strategy assures that SaPIs will be transferred once induced. Several different SaPIs are induced by helper phage 80 α and, in each case, the SaPI commandeers a different non-essential phage protein for its derepression. The highly specific interactions between different SaPI repressors and helper-phage-encoded <b>antirepressors</b> represent a remarkable evolutionary adaptation involved in pathogenicity island mobilization...|$|R
40|$|The TATA box-binding {{activity}} of transcription factor IID (TFIID) is autoinhibited by the N-terminal {{domain of the}} Drosophila TATA box-binding protein- (TBP) associated factor 230 /yeast TBP-associated factor 145 subunit, which binds to the TATA box-binding domain of TBP by mimicking the TATA box structure. Here, we propose a mechanism of transcriptional activation that involves antirepression of this autoinhibitory activity by transcriptional activators. Like the autoinhibitory domain of TFIID, various acidic activators interact with the TATA box-binding domain of TBP. Moreover, the autoinhibitory domain of TFIID, which is known to interact with only the TATA box-binding domain of TBP, acts as an activation domain when fused to the GAL 4 DNA-binding domain, indicating that interaction with the TATA-binding domain of TBP is crucial for activation of transcription. In a reciprocal fashion, the acidic activation domains can function as the autoinhibitory domain when the latter is replaced by the former within TFIID. These results indicate that activation domains and the autoinhibitory domain of TFIID are interchangeable, supporting a role for transcriptional activators as <b>antirepressors</b> of the autoinhibitory {{activity of}} the TATA box binding of TFIID...|$|R
40|$|Cyanobacteria {{and their}} phages are {{significant}} microbial {{components of the}} freshwater and marine environments. We identified a lytic phage, Ma-LMM 01, infecting Microcystis aeruginosa, a cyanobacterium that forms toxic blooms on the surfaces of freshwater lakes. Here, we describe the first sequenced freshwater cyanomyovirus genome of Ma-LMM 01. The linear, circularly permuted, and terminally redundant genome has 162, 109 bp and contains 184 predicted protein-coding genes and two tRNA genes. The genome exhibits no colinearity with previously sequenced genomes of cyanomyoviruses or other Myoviridae. The majority of the predicted genes have no detectable homologues in the databases. These findings indicate that Ma-LMM 01 {{is a member of}} a new lineage of the Myoviridae family. The genome lacks homologues for the photosynthetic genes that are prevalent in marine cyanophages. However, it has a homologue of nblA, which is essential for the degradation of the major cyanobacteria light-harvesting complex, the phycobilisomes. The genome codes for a site-specific recombinase and two prophage <b>antirepressors,</b> suggesting that it has the capacity to integrate into the host genome. Ma-LMM 01 possesses six genes, including three coding for transposases, that are highly similar to homologues found in cyanobacteria, suggesting that recent gene transfers have occurred between Ma-LMM 01 and its host.

40|$|Direct {{targeting}} of critical DNA-binding {{elements of a}} repressor by its cognate <b>antirepressor</b> is an effective means to sequester the repressor and remove a transcription initiation block. Structural descriptions for this, though often proposed for bacterial and phage repressor–antirepressor systems, are unavailable. Here, we describe the structural and functional basis of how the Myxococcus xanthus CarS <b>antirepressor</b> recognizes and neutralizes its cognate repressors to turn on a photo-inducible promoter. CarA and CarH repress the carB operon in the dark. CarS, produced in the light, physically interacts with the MerR-type winged-helix DNA-binding domain of these repressors leading to activation of carB. The NMR structure of CarS 1, a functional CarS variant, reveals a five-stranded, antiparallel β-sheet fold resembling SH 3 domains, protein–protein interaction modules prevalent in eukaryotes but rare in prokaryotes. NMR studies and analysis of site-directed mutants in vivo and in vitro unveil a solvent-exposed hydrophobic pocket lined by acidic residues in CarS, where the CarA DNA recognition helix docks with high affinity in an atypical ligand-recognition mode for SH 3 domains. Our findings uncover an unprecedented use of the SH 3 domain-like fold for protein–protein recognition whereby an <b>antirepressor</b> mimics operator DNA in sequestering the repressor DNA recognition helix to activate transcription...|$|E
40|$|The Rhodobacter sphaeroides protein AppA has {{the unique}} quality of sensing and {{transmitting}} light and redox signals. By acting as <b>antirepressor</b> to the PpsR protein, {{it acts as}} a major regulator in photosynthesis gene expression. In this study, we show that by introducing amino acid exchanges into the AppA protein, the in vivo activity as an <b>antirepressor</b> can be greatly altered. The tryptophan 104 to phenylalanine (W 104 F) base exchange greatly diminished blue-light sensitivity of the BLUF domain. From the obtained in vivo data, the difference in thermal recovery rate of the signaling state of the BLUF domain between the wild type and mutated protein was calculated, predicting an about 10 -fold faster recovery in the mutant, {{which is consistent with}} in vitro data. Introduction of a tyrosine 21 to phenylalanine (Y 21 F) or to cysteine (Y 21 C) mutation led to a complete loss of AppA <b>antirepressor</b> activity, while additionally leading to an increase of photosynthesis gene expression after illumination with high blue-light quantities. Interestingly, this effect is not visible in a W 104 F/Y 21 F double mutant that again shows a wild-type-like behavior of the BLUF domain after blue-light illumination, thus restoring the activity of AppA...|$|E

Our more recent results analyzing the complete genome of Lam (refer Wulff et al abstract at this conference) demonstrates that it, too, carries a very similar prophage and apparent lytic cycle.   Our goal {{is to try to}} develop a sensitive, multiwell, microtiter dish assay for high throughput screening of chemicals with ability to trigger the lytic cycle and potentially lead to a chemical treatment method to eliminate Las from infected trees, whether symptomatic with HLB or not.   The intergenic region between the early and late genes of Las phage SC 1 and SC 2 (between locus tags gp 120 and gp 125) were cloned in both directions upstream of the lacZ reporter gene in E. coli.   We then cloned and expressed predicted repressors and anti-repressors from Las to determine responsiveness of the reporter constructs. As expected, the predicted early gene reporters of both SC 1 and SC 2 were constitutively on and the late genes were constitutively off.   However, the predicted repressors and <b>antirepressors</b> failed to function as predicted and a detailed examination of the intergenic region revealed that late gene expression is likely initiated in at least one other location.   Additional putative late gene promoter regions are being analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{initiation}} of transcription by RNA polymerase II depends on general transcription factors (GTFs), {{which include the}} TATA-binding protein (TBP) and the transcription factors (TF) IIB, IIF, IIE and IIH. In order to reconstitute mouse transcription in vitro, we cloned the genes encoding mouse TFIIB, and both subunits of TFIIE and TFIIF from a mouse cDNA library. TBP and TFIIB were expressed in E. coli, while both subunits of TFIIE and the two subunits of TFIIF were expressed in a baculovirus system. All these factors were purified to > 90 % homogeneity. The more complex transcription factors, TFIIH and RNA polymerase II, were purified more than 1000 -fold and to near homogeneity, respectively, from tissue cultured mouse ascites cells. We {{have shown that the}} purified mouse transcription factors are active in a reconstituted RNA polymerase II in vitro transcription assay. The transcription reaction was inhibited by α-amanitine, and dependent on the addition of all the GTFs. Ribonucleotide reductase is a key enzyme in deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. It consists of two subunits, R 1 and R 2, which are both required for the enzyme activity. Transcription of the R 1 and R 2 genes is restiricted to the S-phase of the cell cycle, but the mechanisms that control this coordinated expression remain to be identified. We have studied {{initiation of}} transcription from the mouse R 2 gene using a combination of in vivo reporter gene assays and in vitro transcription assays with crude nuclear extracts or with purified transcription factors. This promoter has an atypical TATA-box and a CCAAT-box that binds the transcription factor NF-Y. We found that a mutation in the R 2 CCAAT-box had no effect on the transcription level in in vitro transcription assays reconstituted with pure transcription factors. However, it significantly decreased the level of transcription in similar experiments using crude nuclear extract. We also found that the sequence downstream from the R 2 transcription start site (5 ´-UTR) (from + 1 to + 17 base pairs relative to transcription start site) is essential for initiation of transcription from this promoter. The presence of the wild type 5 ´-UTR made the R 2 TATA-box redundant. On the other hand, the R 2 5 ´-UTR had a repressing effect on transcription from the mouse R 2 promoter. This region contains a palindrome sequence that covers 10 base pairs, and it is partially conserved in the human R 2 promoter. Gel shift assays and in vitro transcription experiments using antibodies against mouse TAF 4 (=TAF 135) demonstrate that TAF 4 is a component of the protein complex that interacts with this palindrome region, and suggest involvement of this component of the TFIID complex in negative regulation of the R 2 promoter. The Adenovirus Major Late (AdML) promoter is commonly used as a model for studies of transcription initiation and regulation. It is a TATA-box dependent promoter, which also contains an initiator (Inr) element, a CCAAT-box interacting with transcription factor NF-Y, and an E-box binding the upstream stimulatory factor (USF). Using gel shift assays with recombinant NF-Y, USF, and immunopurified human TFIID, we show that binding of USF 1 and NF-Y to DNA is not cooperative and that both factors independently facilitate binding of TFIID to the core promoter. The activation domains of NF-Y are expendable for this effect. Negative cofactor (NC 2) comprises two subunits, which have a histone-fold structure similar to NF-Y, and represses transcription through formation of an inhibitory complex with TBP. Using an in vitro transcription system based on crude nuclear extracts, we show that NC 2 has a negative effect on transcription in the presence of NF-Y or USF 1, indicating that the two activators do not act as <b>antirepressors.</b> In vitro transcription using highly purified transcription factors efficiently reproduces repression of transcription by NC 2. However, USF 1 was inactive and NF-Y had a repressing effect in this system, which suggests that the activator functions of USF and NF-Y depend on cofactors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPhotosynthetic {{bacteria}} regulate photosystem synthesis {{in response}} to alterations in oxygen tension and light intensity. In this study we show that the PpsR repressor from Rhodobacter sphaeroides binds to DNA in a redox-dependent manner through the formation/breakage of an intramolecular disulfide bond. We also demonstrate that PpsR is antagonized by the flavin-containing <b>antirepressor,</b> AppA, {{that is capable of}} breaking the disulfide bond in oxidized PpsR as well as forming a stable AppA-PpsR 2 antirepressor-repressor complex. Blue light excitation of AppA induces a photocycle that is characterized by a long-lived red-shifted absorbance of the flavin.

40|$|ABSTRACT The DNA binding {{activity}} of the photosystem-specific repressor PpsR {{is known to be}} repressed by the <b>antirepressor</b> AppA. AppA contains a blue-light-absorbing BLUF domain and a heme-binding SCHIC domain that controls the interaction of AppA with PpsR in response to light and heme availability. In this study, we have solved the structure of the SCHIC domain and identified the histidine residue that is critical for heme binding. We also demonstrate that dark-adapted AppA binds heme better than light-excited AppA does and that heme bound to the SCHIC domain significantly reduces the length of the BLUF photo-cycle. We further show that heme binding to the SCHIC domain is affected by the redox state of a disulfide bridge located in the Cys-rich carboxyl-terminal region. These results demonstrate that light, redox, and heme are integrated inputs that control Ap-pA’s ability to disrupt the DNA binding {{activity of}} PpsR. IMPORTANCE Photosynthetic bacteria must coordinate synthesis of the tetrapyrroles cobalamin, heme, and bacteriochlorophyll, as overproduction of the latter two is toxic to cells. A key regulator controlling tetrapyrrole biosynthesis is PpsR, and the activity of PpsR is controlled by the heme-binding and light-regulated <b>antirepressor</b> AppA. We show that AppA binds heme only under dark conditions and that heme binding significantly affects the length of the AppA photocycle. Since AppA interacts with PpsR only in the dark, bound heme thus stimulates the <b>antirepressor</b> activity of PpsR. This causes the redirection of tetrapyrrole bio...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} general {{strategy}} for the selection of bacterial clones that express DNA-binding activities corresponding to particular DNA recognition sites. The selection uses a "challenge phage" vector, P 22 Kn 9 arc-amH 1605, into which is substituted a synthetic DNA-binding site for a site that controls transcription of the P 22 <b>antirepressor</b> (ant) gene. Constitutive synthesis of <b>antirepressor</b> channels a challenge phage into lytic development and efficiently kills an infected host, unless the substituted site is bound by a specific protein; in this case, the challenge phage prefers lysogenic development, and the host survives and acquires an antibiotic-resistance phenotype. Infections with challenge phages carrying the E. coli Lac operator, phage λOL 1 operator, or synthetic, "idealized" E. coli Trp and Tn 10 Tet operators select clones that express each of the corresponding binding activities.

40|$|Many {{species of}} {{bacteria}} harbor multiple prophages in their genomes. Prophages often carry genes that confer a selective {{advantage to the}} bacterium, typically during host colonization. Prophages can convert to infectious viruses through {{a process known as}} induction, which is relevant to the spread of bacterial virulence genes. The paradigm of prophage induction, as set by the phage Lambda model, sees the process initiated by the RecA-stimulated self-proteolysis of the phage repressor. Here we show that a large family of lambdoid prophages found in Salmonella genomes employs an alternative induction strategy. The repressors of these phages are not cleaved upon induction; rather, they are inactivated by the binding of small <b>antirepressor</b> proteins. Formation of the complex causes the repressor to dissociate from DNA. The <b>antirepressor</b> genes lie outside the immunity region and are under direct control of the LexA repressor, thus plugging prophage induction directly into the SOS response. GfoA and GfhA, the antirepressors of Salmonella prophages Gifsy- 1 and Gifsy- 3, each target both of these phages ’ repressors, GfoR and GfhR, even though the latter proteins recognize different operator sites and the two phages are heteroimmune. In contrast, the Gifsy- 2 phage repressor, GtgR, is insensitive to GfoA and GfhA, but is inactivated by an <b>antirepressor</b> from the unrelated Fels- 1 prophage (FsoA). This response is all the more surprising as FsoA is {{under the control of the}} Fels- 1 repressor, not LexA, and plays no apparent role in Fels- 1 induction, which occurs via a Lambda CI-like repressor cleavage mechanism.

40|$|Superinfection of Corynebacterium diphtheriae C 7 (beta) by {{heteroimmune}} phage gamma is productive, whereas superinfection by gamma-bin mutants is for {{the most}} part nonproductive. Exclusion of gamma-bin phage occurred after its DNA had penetrated and was partially expressed in the heteroimmune lysogen. All of the infected cells were killed, and lysis was observed. The beta inhibitor causing exclusion was produced during the prophage state and appeared to be distinct from immune repressor. The ability of gamma-bin phage to superinfect C 7 (beta) productively could be restored by recombination with beta phage, indicating that both beta and gamma phages contain either indentical or similar alleles of the bin gene. The bin gene was mapped by vegetative and prophage crosses and found to be located in the region of the phage genome concerned with regulation. Both beta and gamma wild-type phages induced the resident prophage in a significant fraction of superinfeted heteroimmune lysogens. This, coupled with the fact that induction of C 7 (beta) abolished exclusion, suggests that the bin gene product acts as <b>antirepressor,</b> i. e., it reduces the level of heteroimmune repressor either directly or indirectly. The gamma-bin mutants either failed to produce <b>antirepressor</b> or did so with reduced efficiency. <b>Antirepressor</b> activity was negatively controlled by homoimmune repressor.

Here we show that deletion of 37 amino acids within the second of five HMG box motifs in UBF 2 {{is important for the}} dual role of UBF as transcriptional activator and <b>antirepressor.</b> UBF 1 is a potent <b>antirepressor</b> and transcriptional activator, whereas the ability of UBF 2 to counteract histone H 1 -mediated repression and to stimulate ribosomal gene transcription both in vivo and in vitro is at least one order of magnitude lower. The difference in transcriptional activity between UBF 1 and UBF 2 is due to their different binding to the ribosomal gene promoter and enhancer. Apparently, the presence of an intact HMG box 2 modulates the sequence-specific binding of UBF to rDNA control elements. However, the interaction of UBF with rDNA does not entirely depend on sequence recognition. Both UBF isoforms bind efficiently to four-way junction DNA, indicating that they recognize defined DNA structures rather than specific sequences.

40|$|Prophages {{switch from}} {{lysogenic}} to lytic mode {{in response to}} the host SOS response. The primary factor that governs this switch is a phage repressor, which is typically a host RecA-dependent autocleavable protein. Here, in an effort to reveal the mechanism underlying the phenotypic differences between the Salmonella temperate phages SPC 32 H and SPC 32 N, whose genome sequences differ by only two nucleotides, we identified a new class of Podoviridae phage lytic switch <b>antirepressor</b> that is structurally distinct from the previously reported Sipho- andMyoviridae phage antirepressors. The SPC 32 H repres-sor (Rep) is not cleaved by the SOS response but instead is inactivated by a small <b>antirepressor</b> (Ant), the expression of which is negatively controlled by host LexA. A single nucleotide mutation in the consensus sequence of the LexA-binding site, which overlaps with the ant promoter, results in constitutive Ant synthesis and consequently induces SPC 32 N to enter the lytic cycle. Numerous potential Ant homologues were identified in a variety of putative prophages and temperate Podo-viridae phages, indicating that antirepressors may be widespread among temperate phages in the order Caudovirales to mediate a prudent prophage induction.

Recent reports have revealed the presence of two adjacent genes upstream of the staphylococcal blaZ {{thought to be the}} <b>antirepressor</b> (blaR 1) and repressor (blaI) genes. In the present study, beta-lactamase expression mutants of the staphylococcal beta-lactamase plasmid pI 524 were generated by transposon mutagenesis with the transposon Tn 917. Tn 917 insertions upstream of blaZ in either blaR 1 or blaI resulted in constitutive beta-lactamase production, indicating that the repressor function is lost with insertion of Tn 917 into either gene. This finding supports the concept that the staphylococcal beta-lactamase regulatory genes are encoded on a polycistronic mRNA. The corresponding region upstream of the enterococcal blaZ from Enterococcus faecalis HH 22 was sequenced and compared with the staphylococcal blaR 1 sequence. The two sequences were identical for 893 nucleotides, and then the sequences diverged completely.

Challenge phages were constructed that carried inserts containing either the contiguous P' 123 arm-type sites or the single P' 1 site within the P 22 phage promoter, Pant, which is required for expression of <b>antirepressor.</b> If Int protein binds to these sequences in vivo, it represses transcription from Pant. We found that Int repressed Pant in phages carrying the P' 123 sites more efficiently than those carrying only the P' 1 site, suggesting that the protein binds cooperatively at the three adjacent sites. The Int protein from a related lambdoid phage, HK 022, also repressed transcription by binding to the same arm-type sites. Mutations in the P' 123 or P' 1 sites that impair Int binding were isolated by selecting mutant phages that express <b>antirepressor</b> {{in the presence of}} Int. DNA sequence analyses showed that most of the mutants in the challenge phages carrying the P' 123 sites contained multiple changes and that two mutants contained only single-base-pair changes at positions that are completely conserved among all arm-type sites. Thirty-five mutants were isolated and analyzed from phages containing only the P' 1 site. Most mutants contained single-nucleotide changes, and mutations were isolated at 8 of the 10 positions of the site, suggesting that most if not all base pairs in the conserved recognition sequence are involved in Int binding...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacteriophage}} P 22 -based challenge-phage {{system was}} used to study the binding of Xis and FIS to their sites in aitP of bacteriophage lambda. Challenge phages were constructed that contained the Xl, X 2, and F sites within the P 22 Pa.,, promoter, which is required for expression of <b>antirepressor.</b> If Xis and FIS bind to these sites in vivo, they repress transcription from P [...] . allowing lysogenization to occur. ChaUlenge phages carrying the X 1 X 2 F region in either orientation exhibited lysogenization dependent on both Xis and FIS. Neither Xis nor FIS was capable of functioning by itself as an efficient repressor in this system. This {{was the first time}} challenge phages have been constructed that require two different proteins bound simultaneously to act as a repressor. Mutations in the Xl, X 2, and F sites that inhibit Xis and FIS from binding were isolated by selecting mutant phages that still expressed <b>antirepressor</b> synthesis in the presence of Xis and FIS. DNA sequence analysis of the mutants revealed 38 unique mutations, including single-base-pair substitutions, multiple-base-pair changes, deletions, and insertions throughout the entire Xl, X 2, and F regions. Some of the mutations verified the importance of certain bases within the proposed consensus sequences for Xis and FIS, while others provided evidence that the DNA sequence outside of the proposed binding sites may affect the binding of the individual proteins or the cooperativity between them. During lysogenic development, bacteriophage X integrate...|$|E
40|$|Transcriptional {{repression}} {{represents an}} important component in the regulation of cell differentiation and oncogenesis mediated by nuclear hormone receptors. Hormones act to relieve repression, thus allowing receptors to function as transcriptional activators. The transcriptional corepressor SMRT {{was identified as a}} silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors. SMRT is highly related to another corepressor, N-CoR, suggesting the existence of a new family of receptor-interacting proteins. We demonstrate that SMRT is a ubiquitous nuclear protein that interacts with unliganded receptor heterodimers in mammalian cells. Furthermore, expression of the receptor-interacting domain of SMRT acts as an <b>antirepressor,</b> suggesting the potential importance of splicing variants as modulators of thyroid hormone and retinoic acid signaling...|$|E
40|$|The {{physiological}} {{conditions and}} molecular interactions that control phage production {{have been studied}} {{in only a few}} families of temperate phages. We investigated the mechanisms that regulate activation of lytic development in lysogens of coliphage N 15, a prophage that is not integrated into the host chromosome but exists as a linear plasmid with covalently closed ends. We identified the N 15 <b>antirepressor</b> gene, antC, and showed that its product binds to and acts against the main phage repressor, CB. LexA binds to and represses the promoter of antC. Mitomycin C-stimulated N 15 induction required RecA-dependent autocleavage of LexA and expression of AntC protein. Thus, a cellular repressor whose activity is regulated by DNA damage controls N 15 prophage induction...|$|E
40|$|The anoxygenic phototrophic {{bacterium}} Rhodobacter sphaeroides uses different energy sources, {{depending on}} environmental conditions including aerobic respiration or, {{in the absence}} of oxygen, photosynthesis. Photosynthetic genes are repressed at high oxygen tension, but at intermediate levels their partial expression prepares the bacterium for using light energy. Illumination, however, enhances repression under semiaerobic conditions. Here, we describe molecular details of two proteins mediating oxygen and light control of photosynthesis-gene expression: the light-sensing <b>antirepressor</b> AppA and the transcriptional repressor PpsR. Our crystal structures of both proteins and their complex and hydrogen/deuterium-exchange data show that light activation of AppA–PpsR 2 affects the PpsR effector region within the complex. DNA binding studies demonstrate the formation of a light-sensitive ternary AppA–PpsR–DNA complex. We discuss implications of these results for regulation by light and oxygen, highlighting new insights into blue light–mediated signal transductio...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between ant (<b>antirepressor)</b> mRNA and its antisense RNA, sar (small antisense RNA), {{is important in}} regulation {{of the development of}} bacteriophage P 22. Sar is 68 - 69 nucleotides in length and is believed to consist of two hairpin structures separated by a small inter-hairpin region, followed by a short 32 ̆ 7 tail [Schaefer and McClure RNA 1997, 3, 141 - 156]. A novel feature of the proposed secondary structure of the first hairpin is a extremely rare triple U:U base stack. Heteronuclear NMR studies presented here show that the first hairpin does not possess a unique structure {{in the absence of the}} second hairpin. However, it acquires a well-defined structure within full length sar. Remarkably, the triple U:U stack appears to be a stable feature of the first hairpin, regardless of the presence or absence of the second hairpin...|$|E
40|$|Mutations that {{increase}} {{the activity of the}} promoter for the <b>antirepressor</b> gene of phage P 22 were isolated by pseudoreversion of four severe promoter-down mutations. The sequence changes in these pseudorevertants include single base pair substitutions, single base pair deletions, tandem double base pair deletions and multisite mutations. The single base pair substitutions change nonconsensus base pairs to consensus base pairs at positions - 14 and - 8. The other mutations provide support for the idea that the length of the spacer region between the conserved - 35 and - 10 hexamers is an important determinant of promoter strength. Deletions of one or two base pairs in the spacer region apparently activate an alternate - 10 hexamer by shifting it from a spacing of 19 base pairs to a spacing of 18 or 17 base pairs, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{compounds}} exhibit {{various levels}} of toxicity toward living organisms based upon their ability to insert into biological membranes and disrupt normal membrane function. The primary mechanism responsible for organic solvent tolerance in many bacteria is energy-dependent extrusion via efflux pumps. One such bacterial strain, Pseudomonas putida S 12, {{is known for its}} high tolerance to organic solvents as provided through the SrpABC resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family efflux pump. To determine how two putative regulatory proteins (SrpR and SrpS, encoded directly upstream of the SrpABC structural genes) influence SrpABC efflux pump expression, we conducted transcriptional analysis, β-galactosidase fusion experiments, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and pulldown analysis. Together, the results of these experiments suggest that expression of the srpABC operon can be derepressed by two distinct but complementary mechanisms: direct inhibition of the SrpS repressor by organic solvents and binding of SrpS by its <b>antirepressor</b> SrpR...|$|E
40|$|Bacteriophage {{transfer}} (lysogenic conversion) promotes bacterial virulence evolution. There {{is limited}} {{understanding of the}} factors that determine lysogenic conversion dynamics within infected hosts. A murine Salmonella Typhimurium (STm) diarrhea model was used to study the transfer of SopEΦ, a prophage from STm SL 1344, to STm ATCC 14028 S. Gut inflammation and enteric disease triggered > 55 % lysogenic conversion of ATCC 14028 S within 3 days. Without inflammation, SopEΦ transfer was reduced by up to 10 (5) -fold. This was because inflammation (e. g., reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, hypochlorite) triggers the bacterial SOS response, boosts expression of the phage <b>antirepressor</b> Tum, and thereby promotes free phage production and subsequent transfer. Mucosal vaccination prevented a dense intestinal STm population from inducing inflammation and consequently abolished SopEΦ transfer. Vaccination may be a general strategy for blocking pathogen evolution that requires disease-driven transfer of temperate bacteriophages. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Three mutants of {{bacteriophage}} P 1 {{affected in}} their ability to maintain the lysogenic state stably are described here. These mutants were normal in lytic growth, but lysogenic derivatives segregated nonlysogens at abnormally high rates (1 to 30 % per division). Cells harboring these mutant prophages were elongated or filamentous. The mutations responsible for this prophage instabil-ity fell into two classes on the bases of their genetic location, their effect on the ability to lysogenize recA bacteria, and their suppressibility by ant mutations eliminating <b>antirepressor</b> activity. The two mutants that were able to form recA lysogens showed the same prophage instability and partial inhibition of cell division in recA as in rec+ lysogens. The fact that plasmid-linked mutations can cause prophage instability suggests that P 1 codes for {{at least some of the}} functions determining its own autonomy and segregation. P 1 plasmid consists of covalently closed cir-cular duplex DNA molecules of molecular weight about 60 x 106 (10, 12, 36). It is normall...|$|E
40|$|Sar RNA is an {{antisense}} RNA that {{is partly}} responsible for the negative regulation of <b>antirepressor</b> synthesis during development of bacteriophage P 22 (Liao SM et al., 1987, Genes & Dev 1 : 197 - 203; Wu Th, Liao SM, McClure WR, Susskind MM, Genes & Dev 1 : 204 - 212). The structures of sar RNA and its target, ant mRNA, were probed using limited RNase digestion as a function of Mg 2 + concentration. Sar RNA forms two hairpins that are present at all Mg 2 + concentrations (Mg 2 +-independent hairpins). One of the hairpins contains three tandem U x U base pairs. Ant RNA forms three Mg 2 +-independent hairpins and one Mg 2 +-dependent hairpin. In addition, many nucleotides in sar RNA and ant RNA appear to be involved in tertiary interactions. The effects of RNA structure on the pairing reaction are considered in the accompanying paper (Schaefer KL, McClure WR, 1997, RNA 3 : 157 - 174) ...|$|E
