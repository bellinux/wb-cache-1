40|$|The {{composition}} {{has been}} developed, and the physical-chemical {{properties of the}} new solid electrolyte - potassium-barium-gadolinium molibdate the use of which as a material for sensitive layer of the sensor of the halogen-containing substance impurities in air provides its high sensitivity and stability of the characteristics at long operation have been investigated. The investigations on {{the stability of the}} suspensions on base of the different composition potassium-barium-gadolinium molibdate have been made; the conditions for creations of the dense sensitive layers by the cataphoresis and <b>anaphoresis</b> methods have been determined. The optimal thickness of the sensitive layer at wich tyhe minimal consumed power is provided has been determined. The catalytic-active cover of the ruthenium dioxide on the electrode-heater of the sensor has bee developed.
