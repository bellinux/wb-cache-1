5|$|Humans <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in {{suffering}} from lead's effects; {{plants and animals}} are also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species. Animals experience {{many of the same}} effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes such as increased aggression. Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. Animals are used to test the effects of treatments, such as chelating agents, and to provide information on the pathophysiology of lead, such as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.|$|E

25|$|I want to {{conclude}} with a few remarks about the domestic scene {{and the role of}} Social Democrats, U.S.A. in it. We are not a political party with our own candidates. We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in our specific programs for more employment, more insurance, more welfare, less discrimination, less bureaucratic inefficiency. Our spiritual task should be to relate these programs and demands to the underlying philosophy of democracy, to express and defend those larger moral ideals that should inform, programs for which we wish to develop popular support.|$|E

Gastric dilatation volvulus, commonly called bloat, is another serious condition that affects many of the large and giant breed dogs, particularly those with deep chests.

Leonbergers <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in inheriting serious diseases and according to the University of Sydney's LIDA taskforce, Leonbergers have relatively few health issues compared to other dog breeds.|$|E

25|$|On the 11th of March 2017 the Dutch {{government}} has made a decision which changed the relationship between both countries for worse. When the Turks decided to sent the minister of foreign affairs for the 400.000 Turks living in the Netherlands, to have them vote for the Turkish constitutional referendum, the Dutch government denied access into the Netherlands. Later that day minister of family affairs Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya traveled by road to the Netherlands but was escorted {{out of the country}} on orders of the Dutch government. This led to problems in Rotterdam where Dutch police used dogs and water cannon on Sunday to disperse demonstrators. The Dutch <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in this decision, The Netherlands, Austria, Germany, Denmark and Switzerland all have denied the Turkish government to rally in their countries for the referendum.|$|E
