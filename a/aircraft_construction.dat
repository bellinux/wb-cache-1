5|$|In 1938, Waldmann {{applied for}} a career as {{an officer in the}} Luftwaffe for the first time. Travelling to Berlin, he was deemed {{suitable}} but at the age of 16 was too young to volunteer for military service. After the outbreak of World War II, while still at school, Waldmann and his fellow students were forced into compulsory labour service (Reichsarbeitsdienst). Waldmann was assigned to the Brunswick Mechanical Engineering Institute. Since Waldmann had intended to study <b>aircraft</b> <b>construction</b> after his military service, he was reassigned to the Institute of Aeronautical Metrology and Flight Meteorology at the Braunschweig-Waggum airfield under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Heinrich Koppe.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{during the}} Second World War, Allied <b>aircraft</b> <b>construction</b> saw the UK of {{necessity}} concentrating on heavy bombers, leaving {{the production of}} transport aircraft to the USA. This would have left the UK with little experience in transport construction {{at the end of}} the war, so in 1943, a committee under Lord Brabazon of Tara investigated the future of the British civilian airliner market. The Brabazon Committee called for several different aircraft to be developed to specifications composed by the committee for roles felt to fulfil Britain's civilian aviation needs.|$|E
5|$|The Avro Museum , based out of CYBW west of Calgary, Alberta, Canada is {{building}} a 2/3rd scale, manned, high performance flying replica of the Avro Arrow (officially known as ARROW II) to Canadian Aviation Experimental Aircraft Regulations {{in order to become}} an airshow demonstration <b>aircraft.</b> <b>Construction</b> began in October 2007, and by 2012 the fuselage was completed and passed its first MDRA inspection, and now has a serial number. Powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney JT-15D-4s, the ARROW II will have a top speed of approximately 500 knots and a range of 1,800 miles. Current projections show a final cost of the project at approximately one million dollars and it is hoped that ground tests will start in about 2016 with the first flight to follow.|$|E

50|$|The GW-1's wings were {{extended}} in 1961 with new tips to 44.5 ft. The constant-chord wing features a NACA 23018 airfoil and flaps of 25% chord and 22 ft span. The <b>aircraft's</b> <b>construction</b> is all-metal, {{except for the}} fiberglass nose.|$|R
50|$|Extra began {{designing}} aircraft after {{competing in}} the 1982 World Aerobatic Championships. His <b>aircraft</b> <b>constructions</b> revolutionized the aerobatics flying scene and still dominate world competitions. The German pilot Klaus Schrodt won his world championship title flying an aircraft made by the Extra firm.|$|R
5|$|Unfortunately {{his desire}} to be a pilot was postponed. The family {{required}} further income after his father retired. Unable to wait for that opportunity to arise he joined the Royal Engineers on 26 April 1910, as No. 20083. On 24 February 1911 he set sail for Gibraltar on the southern tip of Spain. McCudden spent eighteen months in Gibraltar before returning to England in September 1912. While in Gibraltar he read Flight manual magazine habitually, which explained the theory of flight, <b>aircraft</b> <b>construction</b> and aero engines. He excelled in his service and by 26 April 1913 he had become a qualified Sapper. He also held the grade Air Mechanic 2nd Class, No. 892, which was awarded to him on 28 April 1913. Soon afterwards he {{became a member of the}} Royal Flying Corps (RFC). On 9 May he was posted to Farnborough depot as a mechanic.|$|E

25|$|The {{airframe}} followed contemporary <b>aircraft</b> <b>construction</b> techniques, {{with weight}} savings {{from the use}} of advanced materials and the short airborne life of the missile. The fuselage was essentially tubular, tapering to a point at the nose, housing the guidance equipment, warhead and systems equipment. The engine was fed with air through a distinctive wedge shaped intake under the center fuselage. Its swept wings attached to its fuselage at the middle position, roughly halfway along its length, and a large swept fin attached {{to the top of the}} fuselage at the rear which was sometimes augmented by a large ventral fin at the extreme rear of the fuselage.|$|E

50|$|The last {{aircraft}} {{to be developed}} by the Spartan Aircraft Company was the Spartan NP-1 biplane. The NP-1 was a throwback to earlier aircraft in appearance, though the technology used in the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>construction</b> was certainly more advanced than the wire and fabric used in Spartan's early biplane designs. Built as a United States Navy trainer, the Spartan NP-1 featured a lightweight open-cockpit construction with a Lycoming R-680-B4C 225 h.p. engine.|$|R
25|$|Construction of an Airbus A320 family {{aircraft}} {{assembly plant}} in Mobile was formally announced by Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier from the Mobile Convention Center on July 2, 2012. The plans include a $600 million factory at the Brookley Aeroplex for {{the assembly of}} the A319, A320 and A321 <b>aircraft.</b> <b>Construction</b> began in 2013, with plans for it to become operable by 2015 and produce up to 50 aircraft per year by 2017. The assembly plant is the company's first factory to be built within the United States. It was announced on February 1, 2013, that Airbus had hired Alabama-based Hoar Construction to oversee construction of the facility.|$|E
25|$|In October 1916, Commodore Murray Sueter, the Air Department's Superintendent of <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Construction,</b> {{solicited}} Sopwith for a single-seat aircraft {{capable of}} carrying a 1,000lb torpedo and sufficient fuel to provide an endurance of four hours. The resulting aircraft, designated T.1 by Sopwith, was a large, three-bay biplane. Because the T.1 was designed to operate from carrier decks, its wings were hinged to fold backwards. The T.1 could take off from a carrier deck in four seconds, {{but it was not}} capable of making a carrier landing and no arresting gear was fitted. A split-axle undercarriage allowed the aircraft to carry a 1,000lb Mk. IX torpedo beneath the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|In September 1914, at {{the start}} of World War I, Ferdinand von Zeppelin visualised the concept of a Riesenflugzeug (R) bomber, to be larger than the then-nascent Friedel-Ursinus twin-engined {{military}} aircraft. Using engineers from the Robert Bosch GmbH, he created the Versuchsbau Gotha-Ost (VGO) consortium in a rented hangar at the Gotha factory. Alexander Baumann became his chief engineer, although later the team included other noted engineers including Zeppelin's associate Claudius Dornier, the 1915 pioneer of all-metal <b>aircraft</b> <b>construction</b> in Hugo Junkers and Baumann's protogé Adolph Rohrbach. Almost all of these Zeppelin-Staaken Riesenflugzeug designs used some variation of either pusher configuration and/or push-pull configuration in their engine layout, orientation and placement of their powerplants.|$|E

25|$|The bottom wing was rigged with 3° {{dihedral}} {{while the}} top wing lacked any dihedral; {{this meant that}} the gap between the wings was less at the tips than at the roots; this change had been made at the suggestion of Fred Sigrist, the Sopwith works manager, as a measure to simplify the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>construction.</b> The upper wing featured a central cutout section for the purpose of providing improved upwards visibility for the pilot.|$|R
50|$|An {{architectural}} design competition, {{run by the}} Institute of South African Architects, attracted 38 entries and one of these {{was selected as the}} design for the SAAF memorial. Construction commenced in October 1962 and was completed within 11 months at a cost of R16,000 for the reinforced foundation and R57,000 for the memorial itself. The construction costs were partially funded by donations from British Aerospace Limited and the Society of British <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Constructions</b> Limited.|$|R
25|$|Since World War II, Córdoba {{has been}} {{developing}} a versatile industrial base. The biggest sectors is car and car parts manufacturing: (Renault has a factory which produces a range of cars, Volkswagen has a factory specialized {{in the production of}} gearboxes, and Fiat) has another car factory in the city. Many suppliers (both local and foreign) manufacture car parts for these operations. Additionally, starting in 2017-2018, Nissan and Mercedes-Benz will begin the production of their new pickup truck at the Renault factory. Railway construction (Materfer) and <b>aircraft</b> <b>construction</b> (Fábrica Militar de Aviones) were once significant employers, but their activities have greatly diminished. Furthermore, there are some textile, heavy and chemical industries (e.g. Porta for alcohol).|$|E
25|$|The Bee, {{registered}} G-AEWC, first flew on 3 April 1937 at Heston Aerodrome, piloted by Hubert Broad. Engine cooling problems {{required a}} forced landing, {{and there were}} immediate comments on its sluggish handling {{in the air and}} on its cross-wind taxying problems due to the narrow track undercarriage. This was the Bee's only flight; before there was time to improve the cooling and handling, financial problems forced Carden-Baynes into Receivership in June 1937, and all development stopped. In November 1937, it was reported that production was on hold, until British engines became available. The Bee, its plans, and Carden-Baynes' design for a bigger aircraft were bought by the newly formed Scottish <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Construction</b> Co., but no more was heard of any of them apart from an uncertain report that the Bee was scrapped at Heston in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Oswald {{continued}} {{his interest in}} balloons and airships, and developed his own ideas about leak-tight inflatable envelopes for balloons, airships and the floats of seaplanes, particularly the use of goldbeater's skin. In 1913, he took charge of a new factory at Rochester, {{for the production of}} seaplanes and to enable them to fly from the River Medway. In 1916, he established another factory at Cardington, Bedfordshire, for the production of airships; in 1917, that was nationalised. In April 1917, Oswald assumed overall responsibility for the design of Short Brothers aircraft, following the death of Horace Short. In 1919, Oswald became chairman and managing director of the partnership then incorporated as Short Brothers (Rochester and Bedford) Ltd. He developed construction methods using aluminium alloys such as Duralumin, and in 1920 he patented monocoque and stressed skin <b>aircraft</b> <b>construction</b> techniques. In 1924, he applied the technology to flying boat designs to replace wooden structures that were prone to deterioration. His technology was licensed in the United States, France, and Japan. In the 1920s, Short Brothers manufactured thousands of lightweight bodies for omnibuses, until Oswald's monocoque and stressed skin methods became more widely acceptable to aircraft customers.|$|E
50|$|As he grew up, {{he became}} fascinated with flight, first with kites, then later the Wright brothers' airplane.

50|$|The F27 was {{developed}} during the early 1950s with the expressed intent of producing a capable successor to the earlier piston engine-powered airliners that had become commonplace on the market, such as the successful Douglas DC-3. A key innovation of the F27 was {{the adoption of the}} Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engine, which produced substantially less vibration and noise which provided improved conditions for passengers; another major comfort feature was cabin pressurisation. Innovative manufacturing techniques were also employed in the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>construction.</b>|$|R
