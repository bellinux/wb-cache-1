Northern Transylvania had been annexed by Hungary in 1940, and restrictions on Jews were already in place, but the period Wiesel discusses {{at the beginning of}} the book, 1941–1943, was a relatively calm one for the Jewish population.|$|E

5|$|Utricularia purpurea, a bladderwort, {{comes from}} another genus of {{carnivorous}} plants {{and may have}} lost its appetite for carnivory, at least in part.

Instead, it harbors <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> algae, zooplankton, and debris in the bladders, giving rise to {{the hypothesis that the}} bladders of U. purpurea favor a mutualistic interaction in place of a predator-prey relationship.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Community</b> <b>of</b> Witches {{is based}} on {{interviews}} with more than a hundred practicing Wiccans and Pagans, study of the pre-existing literature on the subject and a national survey of the Pagan community in the U.S. In her work, Berger interprets Wicca as a religion of late modernity, as opposed to postmodernity, and subsequently examines it using the theories of sociologists Anthony Giddens and James A. Beckford. Themes covered include Pagan conceptions of the self, the role of covens and the wider Pagan community, the place of children in the movement and the increasing routinization of Wicca through the foundation of organised churches and clergy.|$|E

5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or wants to raise a point on {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Another myth current amongst Tamils {{says that}} the temple was {{renovate}}d by a legendary Chola king, Kullakotan. According to that myth, the king, who was afflicted with an incurable skin disease, was cured after taking a bath in the ruined temple’s holy pond. Following the miracle, the king went on to renovate the temple and created <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> temple caretakers to maintain the temple. The equivalent myth amongst the Sinhalese people indicates that the diseased king was Rajasinghe or Bhuvanekabahu and the king prayed to the presiding goddess who cured him of his affliction. There were at least two kings called Rajasinghe in Sri Lanka, {{and both of them}} were involved in the actual renovations of the temple, and at least seven kings named Bhuvanekabahu, thereby making it difficult to identify the right king.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the War of 1812, as the British post in Florida was {{evacuated}} the Corps' Florida detachment {{was paid}} off and disbanded. Although several men accompanied the British to Bermuda, the majority continued to live in settlements around the wooden stockade the Corps had garrisoned (which had become a symbol of slave insurrection). This legacy of <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> armed fugitive slaves with a substantial arsenal would lead to tensions with the United States of America. Those remaining later took part in the Battle of Negro Fort in July 1816, after which they joined the southward migration of Seminoles and African Americans escaping the American advance. Members of the Colonial Marine battalion who were deployed on the Atlantic coast withdrew from American territory. They would continue in British service as garrison-in-residence at Bermuda until 1816, when the unit was disbanded and the ex-Marines resettled on Trinidad.|$|E
5|$|By 1686, Seringapatam, {{capital of}} the Kingdom of Mysore, was home to <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> more than 400 Catholics who were {{severely}} harassed in the following two decades when their churches were destroyed and the priest's house confiscated. This destruction was undertaken {{in the name of}} the Wodeyar king, Kanthirava Narasaraja I by his finance minister. The priest's house was eventually returned to the church in 1709. Sometime between 1700 and 1717, another church was built in Rampura, a suburb of Seringapatam, in the face of local opposition. During the period of Chikka Devaraja (1673–1704), 400 priests who protested against high taxes were executed; as per a legend, they were strangled by the wrestlers of his court. Relations between the Wodeyars and the Mangalorean Catholics improved until 1717, when an anti-Christian purge led to the expulsion of the resident priest who was thereafter forbidden to preach. Several more anti-Christian demonstrations followed, but by 1736 relations had once more improved between the two groups.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, {{planning}} blight {{had affected}} {{the area and}} many of the houses had become home to <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> artists and squatters. Eventually, contractors were appointed to carry out the work and a compulsory purchase of property along the proposed route was undertaken. In March 1993, in preparation for the construction of the road, the Earl of Caithness, then the Minister of State for Transport, estimated that there would be 263 properties scheduled for demolition, displacing 550 people, of which he estimated 172 were seeking rehousing. Several original residents, who had in some cases lived in their homes all their lives, refused to sell or move out of their properties.|$|E
