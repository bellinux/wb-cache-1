25|$|Valentino and Giancarlo are {{the kings}} of high living. Every other {{designer}} looks and says, ‘How do they live the way they do?’ I don’t think they made the money that Valentino and Giancarlo did, because Giancarlo {{knows how to make}} money. If they did, they didn’t spend the money like Valentino. No other designer ever did. When the terrorism first started in Rome – the period when the Red Brigades were kidnapping people – Valentino was riding around in a bulletproof Mercedes. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> color the Mercedes was? Red. My God, I thought, you must want to get blown up.|$|E
6000|$|I {{called for}} Jowar Singh, the carpenter, {{whose name was}} first upon the list of those who should bear {{evidence}} against the landholder, saying: 'Are all things ready, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> should be said?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the man. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{he had the}} impudence, the gall, to tell me? That he was in my {{own line}} of business. A detective! He said you had sent {{for him to come}} here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> Gen. Grant {{sat through}} {{fourteen}} speeches like a graven image, but I fetched him! I broke him up, utterly! He {{told me he}} laughed till the tears came and every bone in his body ached. (<b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> the biggest part {{of the success of}} the speech lay in the fact that the audience saw that for once in his life he had been knocked out of his iron serenity.) ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> {{all that}} time she never left me a minute. [To DAISY.] I don't know how I can ever thank you.|$|R
6000|$|... "'You {{must have}} been indeed surprised, Miss Simcoe,' I said; 'it {{must have been}} quite a shock to <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> him at once?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} was astonished {{in the streets}} of our lovely little city, the other day. I met the meanest kind of critter that God ever made--meaner than the horned toad or the Texas lallapaluza! (Laughter.) <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the animile was? He was a knocker! (Laughter and applause.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We, of course, {{talked to}} him. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{he said to}} me? 'What have we to do with Balkan intrigues? We must simply extirpate the scoundrels.' Extirpate is all very well--but what then? The imbecile! I screamed at him, 'But you must spiritualize--don't you understand?--spiritualize the discontent.'..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{will depend}} upon whether you tell her. She's {{prepared}} for it, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> she counts upon for her defence? On your believing that I lie. Perhaps you do; don't make yourself uncomfortable to hide it. Only, as it happens this time, I don't. I've told plenty of little idiotic fibs, but they've never hurt any one but myself." ...|$|E
5000|$|Uncle James (who {{after hours}} of making up rather fancies himself as Father Christmas). [...] "Well, my little man, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> who I am?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... --I {{just wanted}} to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that? No. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> why? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They weren't all Mexicans, Mr. Obray. Several of {{them were}} Americans. We've {{got one of the}} Americans right here. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> who it is? Jack Pankhurst!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} a war for which Germany has been {{preparing}} for twenty years will be over in a few weeks?" [...] said Walter passionately. [...] "This isn't a paltry struggle in a Balkan corner, Harvey. It is a death grapple. Germany comes to conquer or to die. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> will happen if she conquers? Canada will be a German colony." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By George, I {{never thought}} of it. Of course it's Christmas Day. We'll have many more of them, too. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I've been thinking? What a confounded shame we're done out of our Christmas dinner. Wait till I lay hands on Dettmar. I'll {{take it out of}} him. And it won't be with an iron {{belaying}} pin either, Just two bunches of naked knuckles, that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, Mr. Henchy," [...] {{said the}} old man, [...] "you'd keep up better style than some of them. I was talking one day to old Keegan, the porter. 'And {{how do you like}} your new master, Pat?' says I to him. 'You haven't much {{entertaining}} now,' says I. 'Entertaining!' says he. 'He'd live on the smell of an oil-rag.' <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he told me? Now, I declare to God I didn't believe him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{that we are}} cousins?" [...] This was {{a slight}} exaggeration, but {{he was glad to}} advance any plea to her {{confidence}} that occurred to him.|$|R
6000|$|ANNYS <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{how long}} we have been married? Eight years. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> sir, that all that time we {{have never had a}} difference? Don't you think it will be good for you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you please," [...] I answered. [...] "I'm used to it. I haven't eaten for ten days, <b>and,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> {{trying to}} begin to eat again is a confounded nuisance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he {{returned}} without noticing her manner; [...] "and I think I can find that water again. I've been studying it up all night, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I'm going to do? I {{am going to}} make the earthquake that lost it help me to find it again." [...] He paused, and looked at her with a smile and a return of his former enthusiasm. [...] "Do you remember the crack in the adobe field that stopped you yesterday?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{the first}} admitted, [...] "you do miss the oysters. It {{was the last}} of the R months when we landed in New York; <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> we did the first thing--? We drove to Fulton Market, and had one of those Fulton Market broils! My husband said we should have had it if it had been July. He used to dream of the American oysters when we were in Europe. Gentlemen are so fond of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You call me the Mare," [...] {{she went}} on. [...] "Do {{you know how}} I got that name? They gave it me after they had shrivelled up my lips and marred the beauty of my face with irons. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they made me do? They made me carry my husband to the stake upon my back because they said that a horse must be ridden. And {{do you know who}} said this? That priest who stands before you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boord, sir? <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{so little}} of Boords as that? Why, there ain't one of them but owns cottages themselves, and it's as much as my place is worth--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, mamma {{said she}} could not think how Miss May could take one from thence. The whole place is full of thieves, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> Bessie Boulder has lost her gold pencil-case." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, we can {{buy them}} all now. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> Bab, I think Adelmar and Ermelind might find a nice lot of natural {{petroleum}} and frighten Mustafa ever so much with it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no need, George, {{for you to}} continue," [...] and then, fixing his {{glittering}} eye on Philip: [...] "it is very melancholy for me, {{having only}} one son, to know him {{to be such a}} brute, such a bearer of false witness, such an impostor as you are. Do you know that I have just seen Mr. Bellamy, the head clerk at the bank, and inquired if he knew anything of what happened about that ten pounds, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he told me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{has learned}} suddenly. Everybody can sing who has {{anything}} to sing about. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> she said about your dear wet eyes, Grizel? She said they were just sweet. And {{do you know why}} she left us so suddenly? She ran home gleefully to stitch and dust and beat carpets, and get baths ready, and look after the affairs of everybody, which she is sure must be going to rack and ruin because she has been away for half an hour!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think Mr. Drexley {{is quite}} the nicest man I know," [...] she {{declared}} gaily. [...] "I sent him three little fairy tales, and last week he sent me a cheque for them and asked for more. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he said, Douglas? I asked him to let me have his honest opinion as to whether I could make enough to live on by such work as I sent him, and he replied {{that there could be}} no possible doubt about it. He wants me to write something longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{came just}} in time," [...] replied Pan-at-lee; [...] "but who are <b>you</b> <b>and</b> how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that I was here <b>and</b> what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> of Om-at <b>and</b> where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come from <b>and</b> what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> mean by calling Om-at, gund?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> Uncle Richard?" [...] said Mary, pausing {{about six}} feet away and holding out her hand. [...] "I heard you scolding my poor dad about his bow-window. In fact, you woke me up; <b>and,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>you</b> used exactly the same words as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> at your visit after we came down from London last year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, really, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> why? Shall I {{tell you}} why? I will tell you," [...] and he grasped {{him by the}} arm and whispered hoarsely in his ear: [...] "Because she loves you, Mr. Bingham." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{met them}} just {{now in the}} village, but my brother is enchanted. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> was Julius's first {{introduction}} to her? It was at a great school-feast, where they had the regimental {{children as well as}} the town ones. A poor little boy went off in an epileptic fit, and Julius found her holding him, with her own hand in his mouth to hinder the locking of the teeth. He said her fingers were bitten almost to the bone, but she made quite light of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe she}} has suffered; on the contrary, she has enjoyed. Osmond's {{marriage}} has given his daughter a great little lift. Before that {{she lived in}} a hole. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the mother thought? That you might take such a fancy to the child that you'd do something for her. Osmond of course could never give her a portion. Osmond was really extremely poor; but of course you know all about that. Ah, my dear," [...] cried the Countess, [...] "why did you ever inherit money?" [...] She stopped a moment as if she saw something singular in Isabel's face. [...] "Don't tell me now that you'll give her a dot. You're capable of that, but I would refuse to believe it. Don't try to be too good. Be a little easy and natural and nasty; feel a little wicked, for the comfort of it, once in your life!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't he {{beautiful}} and good too himself?--altogether, whatever he may say, a lovely acquaintance to have made? You're {{just the right}} people for me--I see it now; <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what,</b> between you, you must do?" [...] Then as Susie still but stared, wonderstruck and holding herself: [...] "You must simply see me through. Any way you choose. Make it out together. I, on my side, will be beautiful too, and we'll be--the three of us, with whatever others, oh as many as the case requires, any one you like!--a sight for the gods. I'll be as easy for you as carrying a feather." [...] Susie took {{it for a moment}} in such silence that her young friend almost saw her--and scarcely withheld the observation--as taking it for [...] "a part of the disease." [...] This accordingly helped Milly to be, as she judged, definite and wise. [...] "He's at any rate awfully interesting, isn't he?--which is so much to the good. We haven't at least--as we might have, with the way we tumbled into it--got hold of one of the dreary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, he only said, 'But he'll ask {{you again}} now, {{you may be}} sure, my child.' And I replied very gravely, I didn't think <b>you</b> would. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> Cyril, I really don't think you will, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'But {{you were}} {{regularly}} hiding, Mr. Crow!' I cried, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> that mixed him {{up so much}} that if there hadn't been feathers on his head I really believe you could have seen that he was blushing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] drawled the American. [...] "It's been searched by servants, policemen, local policeman, {{and quite}} a lot of people; <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> I have a notion that nobody round here is likely to have searched it at all." ...|$|R
