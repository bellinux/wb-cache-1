40|$|Early {{fatigue damage}} in non-unidirectional {{multi-ply}} graphite/epoxy composites is manifested by a distribution of cracks and disbonds through {{the bulk of}} the material. Such damage is subtle and is difficult to detect with conventional ultrasonic technology. Consequently, a new ultrasonic measurement technique called phase-insensitive tone-burst spectroscopy has been developed. The new technique eliminates problems associated with phase cancellation and pulse shape artifacts inherent to conventional broadband ultrasonic spectral measurement systems and produces clean spectral information irrespective of specimen inhomogeneity or irregularities in surface geometry. Application of the new technique to measurements of graphite/epoxy composites has yielded frequency-domain profiles that show distinct differences in ultrasonic attenuation, <b>attenuation</b> <b>slope,</b> and velocity for each specimen experiencing a different level of fatigue damage...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{ultrasound}} (QUS) is {{a promising}} technique for non-invasive tissue characterization. In this work, {{the potential of}} QUS to assess thermal therapy in liver tissue was examined. Specifically, the QUS parameters of <b>attenuation</b> <b>slope,</b> effective scatterer size (ESD), effective acoustic concentration (EAC), and envelope statistics parameters ?? and k were evaluated {{with respect to their}} ability to discriminate between heated and unheated liver tissue. Two sets of experiments were conducted for this purpose. In the first, a series of freshly excised and bisected rat livers was exposed by placing half of a lobe in a saline bath at 60 ??C for 10 minutes and the other half in 37 ??C saline. Each sample was then scanned using single-element ultrasonic transducers with a nominal center frequency of 20 MHz. In the second experiment, a series of fresh rat livers was exposed to high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to produce a discolored region of permanent damage. These samples were scanned in the area of damage before and after HIFU exposure with a 20 MHz single element transducer. Samples in both experiments were preserved, and histology slides were generated. In the saline bath experiments, statistically significant differences in <b>attenuation</b> <b>slope,</b> ESD, and EAC were observed between heated and unheated samples, while the changes in k and ?? were not statistically significant. <b>Attenuation</b> <b>slope</b> increased on average from 0. 65 dB/cm/MHz in untreated liver to 1. 1 dB/cm/MHz in treated liver. Statistically significant differences (p< 0. 05) in ESD and EAC were observed using spherical Gaussian and fluid-filled sphere models between unheated and heated sides of every sample examined, with ESD decreasing by 34 % and EAC increasing by 18 dB with thermal insult. A linear model was also considered, and statistically significant increases in slope were observed for all samples, as well as statistically significant decreases in intercept for 5 of 7 samples. The mean k parameter was found to decrease for 5 of 6 samples, although these changes were not statistically significant. Histology slides revealed a decrease of approximately 2. 5 % in cell diameter with heating. The HIFU experiments resulted in an increase in ESD and decrease in EAC in the region of the lesion as determined by visual inspection of the sample. The increases in ESD were significant in 3 of 5 samples for both spherical Gaussian and fluid-filled sphere form-factor models, while the decreases in EAC were statistically significant for 4 of 5 samples for these same models. Statistically significant differences were observed in spectral slope in 3 of 5 samples and in spectral intercept in 2 of 5 samples.

By comparing the variance encountered in local measurements and in measurements {{at a number of}} adjoining sites, the need for averaging over large volumes of tissue to avoid the effects of large fluctuations is established. In spleens of patients with myelofibrosis, no correlation between fibrosis and attenuation was found. However it was found that variations in splenic volume were accompanied by inverse changes in attenuation, most likely due to blood pooling. A correlation was found between splenic blood flow per unit organ volume and attenuation. In cirrhotic livers, attenuation was significantly increased with fatty infiltration, but only slightly increased in livers containing minimal fat.

40|$|In this study, an {{algorithm}} previously {{developed for}} estimating the total ultrasonic attenuation along the propagation {{path from the}} surface of the transducer to a region of interest (ROI) in tissue, was modified to make it more practical for use in clinical settings. Specifically, the algorithm was re-derived for when a tissue mimicking phantom rather than a planar reflector is used to obtain the reference power spectrum. The reference power spectrum is needed to compensate for the transfer function of the transmitted pulse, the transfer function of transducer, and the diffraction effects that result from focusing∕beam forming. The modified algorithm was tested on simulated radio frequency (RF) echo lines obtained from two samples that have different scatterer sizes and different <b>attenuation</b> coefficient <b>slopes,</b> one of which was used as a reference. The mean and standard deviation of the percent errors in the attenuation coefficient estimates (ACEs) were less than 5 % and 10 %, respectively, for ROIs that contain more than 10 pulse lengths and more than 25 independent echo lines. The proposed algorithm was also tested on two tissue mimicking phantoms that have <b>attenuation</b> coefficient <b>slopes</b> of 0. 7 dB∕cm-MHz and 0. 5 dB∕cm-MHz respectively, the latter being the reference phantom.

40|$|The <b>attenuation</b> {{coefficient}} <b>slope</b> (ACS) has {{the potential}} to be used for tissue characterization and as a diagnostic ultrasound tool, hence complementing B-mode images. The ACS can be valuable for estimation of other ultrasound parameters such as the backscatter coefficient. There is a well-known tradeoff between the precision of the estimated ACS values and the data block size used in spectral-based techniques such as the spectral log difference (SLD). This trade-off limits the practical usefulness of spectral-based attenuation imaging techniques. In this thesis work, the regularized spectral log difference (RSLD) technique is presented in detail and evaluated with simulations and experiments with physical phantoms, ex vivo and in vivo. The ACS values obtained when using the RSLD technique were compared to the ones obtained when using the SLD technique, as well as the ground truth ACS values obtained with insertion loss techniques. The results showed that the RSLD technique allowed significantly decreasing estimation variance when using small data block sizes (i. e., standard deviation of percentage error reduced by more than an order of magnitude in all cases when using 10 x 10 data blocks) without sacrificing estimation accuracy. Therefore, the RSLD allows for the reconstruction of attenuation coefficient images with an improved trade-off between spatial resolution and estimation precision. Tesi...|$|R

To extensively investigate the properties of the A 1 pulley system and the surrounding tissues for assessing trigger finger, a 30 MHz ultrasound system was implemented to perform in vitro experiments using the hypodermis, A 1 pulley, and superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) dissected from cadavers. Ultrasound signals were acquired from both the transverse and sagittal planes of each tissue sample. The quantitative ultrasonic parameters, including sound speed, attenuation coefficient, integrated backscatter (IB) and Nakagami parameter (m), were subsequently estimated to characterize the tissue properties. The results demonstrated that the acquired ultrasound images have high resolution and are able to sufficiently differentiate the variations of tissue textures. Moreover, the <b>attenuation</b> <b>slope</b> of the hypodermis is larger than those of the A 1 pulley and SDFT.

We established a CT-based margin analysis method by comparing a target lesion with normal lung attenuation, drawing a slope to represent the attenuation changes. This approach was applied to patients with invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (n = 40) or bacterial pneumonia (n = 30). Correlations among multiple regions of interest (ROIs) were obtained using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values. CT visual assessment, margin and texture parameters were compared for differentiating the two disease entities. The attenuation and margin parameters in multiple ROIs showed excellent ICC values. Attenuation slopes obtained at the margins revealed a difference between invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma and pneumonia (P< 0. 001), and mucinous adenocarcinoma produced a sharply declining <b>attenuation</b> <b>slope.</b> On multivariable logistic regression analysis, pneumonia had an ill-defined margin (odds ratio (OR), 4. 84; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 26 - 18. 52; P = 0. 02), ground-glass opacity (OR, 8. 55; 95 % CI, 2. 09 - 34. 95; P = 0. 003), and gradually declining attenuation at the margin (OR, 12. 63; 95 % CI, 2. 77 - 57. 51, P = 0. 001).

Methods: Ultrasonic parameters including <b>attenuation</b> <b>slope</b> (β), integrated attenuation (IA) and integrated backscatter (IBS) were measured for the frequency range of 10 - 25 MHz from echographic signals of the forearm and neck dermis of 20 normal subjects in vivo.

Spectral {{attenuation}} and absorption {{coefficients of}} particulate matter and colocated hydrographic measurements were {{obtained in the}} Mid-Atlantic Bight during the fall of 1996 and the spring of 1997 {{as part of the}} Coastal Mixing and Optics experiment. Within the bottom boundary layer (BBL) the magnitude of the beam attenuation decreased and its spectral shape became steeper with distance from the bottom. Concurrently, the slope of the particulate size distribution (PSD) was found to increase with distance from the bottom. Changes in the PSD shape and the magnitude of the beam attenuation as functions of distance from the bottom in the BBL are consistent with particle resuspension and settling in the BBL, two processes that are dependent on particle size and density. For particles of similar density, resuspension and settling would result in a flattening of the PSD and an increase in the beam attenuation toward the bottom. In both fall and spring the magnitude of the particle attenuation coefficient correlates with its spectral shape, with a flatter shape associated with higher values of the attenuation. This observation is consistent with idealized optical theory for polydispersed nonabsorbing spheres. According to this theory, changes in the steepness of the particle size distribution (particle concentration as a function of size) will be associated with changes in the steepness of the attenuation spectra as a function of wavelength; a flatter particle size distribution will be associated with a flatter attenuation spectrum.

Current clinical assessment of radiation-induced fibrosis is generally limited to clinician-based rating scales, which are usually not sufficient for quantitative and objective evaluations. Ultrasonic propagation properties of tissues are widely reported {{to be sensitive to}} the alterations of tissue compositions and structures. Based on our previous feasibility study, we used four parameters including skin thickness and three ultrasonic parameters of dermal tissues (<b>attenuation</b> <b>slope</b> [β], integrated attenuation [IA] and integrated backscatter [IBS]) in the frequency range of 10 to 25 MHz for the assessment of skin fibrosis. Experiments were conducted on the forearm and neck skin in patients with postirradiation fibrosis in the neck region. The palpation score and stiffness of the neck soft tissue were also measured as an indication of fibrotic severity. Comparisons of the results between 38 patients and 20 control subjects showed a significantly smaller β (p = 0. 005) and a significantly larger skin thickness (p 0. 05). In conclusion, ultrasound tissue characterization may provide additional information for the assessment of postirradiation skin fibrosis in the neck region.

40|$|New {{approaches}} {{in the field}} of ultrasound utilize the frequency content of the backscattered signal, which contains information about the scattering tissue structure and enables quantitative ultrasound imaging. The ultrasonic attenuation is a quantitative parameter {{that can be used to}} characterize tissue. Furthermore, for any scatterer size estimations, the spectral distortions caused by attenuation need to be corrected, and therefore the attenuation has to be measured in vivo to make such techniques applicable for medical imaging. There are two main techniques, spectral difference and spectral shift, used to estimate the attenuation from backscattered ultrasound data. In this work we focus on the spectral shift method, which utilizes the downshift of the center frequency of a pulse propagating through an attenuating medium. The spectral shift method is less sensitive than the spectral difference method and there has not been much work done on estimating the accuracy and precision of the attenuation estimates. The amount of downshift of the pulse depends on the square of the absolute bandwidth of the pulse and is believed to be a crucial parameter for the accuracy of the attenuation estimate. An algorithm utilizing the spectral shift method was implemented and tested on virtual and physical phantoms with different attenuation slopes. The virtual phantoms were interrogated with pulses with a wide range of center frequencies and fractional bandwidths. We found that the algorithm used to estimate the <b>attenuation</b> <b>slope</b> is unbiased but has a high variance in the estimates for situations where the amount of downshift of the pulse is small. Experiments with two transducers differing in absolute bandwidth indicated that for a fixed analysis depth higher bandwidths perform better. i...|$|E

The simulated galaxies at z≃ 5, which have M_ 1500 ≤ - 18. 0 and 7. 5 ≤log(M/M_) ≤ 10. 2, display a mass-dependent α-enhancement, with a median value of [α/Fe]_z= 5 ≃ 4 × [α/Fe]_Z_. The median Fe/H ratio of the simulated galaxies is 0. 14 ± 0. 05 which, even including the effects of nebular continuum, produces steep intrinsic UV continuum slopes; 〈β_i〉 = - 2. 4 ± 0. 05. Using a set of simple dust attenuation models, in which the wavelength-dependent attenuation is assumed to be of the form A(λ) ∝λ^n, we explore the parameter values which best reproduce the observed z= 5 luminosity function (LF) and colour-magnitude relation (CMR). We find that a simple model in which the absolute UV attenuation is a linearly increasing function of log stellar mass, and the dust <b>attenuation</b> <b>slope</b> (n) is within the range - 0. 7 ≤ n ≤- 0. 3, can successfully reproduce the LF and CMR over a wide range of stellar population synthesis model (SPS) assumptions. This range of attenuation curves is consistent with a power-law fit to the Calzetti attenuation law in the UV (n=- 0. 55), and other similarly `grey' star-forming galaxy attenuation curves recently derived at z≃ 2. In contrast, attenuation curves as steep as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction curve (n=- 1. 24) are formally ruled out. Finally, we show that our models are consistent with recent 1. 3 mm ALMA observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), and predict the form of the z≃ 5 IRX-β relation.

The attenuation at lambda = 710 nm was used as a proxy for particle concentration, TSM, whereas a novel parameter was adopted as an optical indicator for chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration, based on the local maximum of c(lambda) observed at the long-wavelength side of the red band Chl-a absorption peak. In addition, since coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) has an important influence on the beam attenuation spectral shape and complementary measurements of particle size distribution were available, the beam <b>attenuation</b> spectral <b>slope</b> was used to analyze the CDOM content. Results were successfully compared with optical and biogeochemical variables from laboratory analysis of collocated water samples, and statistically significant correlations were found between the attenuation proxies and the biogeochemical variables TSM, Chl-a and CDOM. This outcome depicted the potential of high-frequency beam attenuation measurements as a simple, continuous and cost-effective approach for rapid detection of changes and patterns in biogeochemical properties in complex coastal environments...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the {{preliminary}} {{results of a}} study concerning the fan dynamics in {{the valley of the}} Mucone River (Sila Massif, southern Italy) are presented. In the study area highly weathered Palaeozoic crystalline rocks crop out, ranging from residual soils to moderately weathered rocks. Because of the rugged topography and the abundance of weathered deposits, mass movements affect the great majority of the catchments. The most common instability phenomena are represented by rotational and translational slides, with subordinate rockfalls on steep to near vertical slopes. Debris-flow and debris avalanche scars occur at the upper-middle reaches of many catchments. They are caused by mobilization of colluvial and weathered materials during large storms and are usually channelized in the main canyon of the basin. At the catchment mouth, deposition of debris-flow material occurs, contributing to the building up of fans. In order to assess the fan morphodynamics and the slope evolution in the temporal range 1955 – 1996, multi-year air-photo interpretation and field surveys concerning morphodynamic processes and vegetation cover features were carried out. Field observations allowed discriminating the type of fan deposits (debris-flow or water-flow dominated, mixed deposits) and the successional stages of vegetation. Results showed that fans were concerned by different activity and dissection modality, in addition to diverse evolution patterns in vegetation communities, according to the fan aspect. At the basin scale, from 1955 to 1996 changes in land use and in the disturbance regime involved a considerable expansion of natural vegetation cover at the expense of cultivated lands. Such occurrences very likely {{played a major role in}} determining a remarkable <b>attenuation</b> in <b>slope</b> instability at the basin scale and a progressive trend toward inactivity of the fans...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{evaluating}} the porosity volume content in composite laminates using {{the slope of the}} ultrasonic attenuation with respect to frequency has been reported before in these proceedings 1, 2. The method was first applied to laminates laid up from unidirectional prepreg tapes and has now been extended to the case of woven composite laminates. It was found that a linear relationship still holds between the porosity volume fraction and the attenuation slope; however, the constant of proportionality is quite different for the case of woven laminates. This difference is attributed to the differences in pore morphology in the woven and nonwoven laminates. Qualitatively, the voids are flatter and longer (needle-like or strip-crack-like) in the interlaminar region of nonwoven laminates of unidirectional prepregs and are very effective in blocking the sound energy. On the other hand, voids tend to be localized in the resin-rich pockets of woven laminates and remain spherical, as shown in Fig. 1. The <b>attenuation</b> and the <b>slope</b> of the <b>attenuation</b> are therefore lower (by about a factor of 2) in the woven composite for the same amount of porosity content. Quantitatively, the “void content-attenuation slope” relationship is modeled for both woven and nonwoven laminates in terms of the scattering amplitude of P-waves from voids of different shapes...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} {{to operate a}} number of radio communication channels from a single control room without time-sharing between the various channels. Here {{it is necessary to}} operate a number of transmitters and receivers simultaneously from the same base station or mobile unit without interference. The best method to achieve this has been found in the use of filters inserted in the transmission line between the antenna and the transmitter(s) on one hand and the receiver(s) on the other hand. The basic unit employed in the design of microwave filters is usually a cavity resonator of which the most important factors are the Q, insertion loss and resonant frequency. However, a problem which frequently arises with cavity resonators is the accurate determination of these resonant characteristics complicated by the presence of coupling port, materials and various design and geometrical deviations. Such cavities have been investigated in several cases and the results have been generalised, but this investigation has been conducted to examine thoroughly most of the problems being met in present practice. Design and development of some common resonant structures are considered. Emphasis is placed on solutions found to special problems especially regarding complicated boundary conditions. Furthermore, investigation includes methods for optimising resonant parameters such as insertion loss and Q, trading of insertion loss with coupled cavity selectivity, frequency tuning and compensation for frequency variations due to wide ranges of operating temperatures. By comparing Q values obtained in practice with theoretical values, it has been possible to establish an appropriate Q loss budget to as to facilitate accurate prediction of coupled cavity unloaded Q. A satisfactory agreement between theory and practice has been obtained. By application of the results of theoretical analysis and experiment, it is shown that microwave filters can be designed to have a desired insertion loss and off-band <b>attenuation</b> <b>slope.</b> Steps leading to designs of any number of cascaded cavities in a two-port network and, subsequently, multi-port networks are discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis {{is thought}} to be {{associated}} with more mood symptoms and worse cognitive functioning. This study examined whether variation in HPA axis activity underlies the association between mood symptoms and cognitive functioning. Methodology/Principal Findings: In 65 bipolar patients cognitive functioning was measured in domains of psychomotor speed, speed of information processing, attentional switching, verbal memory, visual memory, executive functioning and an overall mean score. Severity of depression was assessed by the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-self rating version. Saliva cortisol measurements were performed to calculate HPA axis indicators: cortisol awakening response, diurnal slope, the evening cortisol level and the cortisol suppression on the dexamethasone suppression test. Regression analyses of depressive symptoms and cognitive functioning on each HPA axis indicator were performed. In addition we calculated percentages explanation of the association between depressive symptoms and cognition by HPA axis indicators. Depressive symptoms were associated with dysfunction in psychomotor speed, attentional switching and the mean score, as well as with <b>attenuation</b> in diurnal <b>slope</b> value. No association was found between HPA axis activity and cognitive functioning and HPA axis activity did not explain the associations between depressive symptoms and cognition. Conclusions/Significance: As our study is the first one in this field specific for bipolar patients and changes in HPA-axi...|$|R

In addition, we report results on the frequency dependence of <b>attenuation</b> as the <b>slope</b> of <b>attenuation</b> with respect to frequency, b = Da(f) /Df. The <b>slope</b> of <b>attenuation</b> is an attractive parameter since it is quantitative, yet does not require interface corrections like conventional quantitative attenuation measurements. This {{is a consequence of}} the assumption that interface correction terms are frequency independent. Uncertainty in those corrections terms compromises the value of conventional quantitative attenuation data. [2, 3]. EXPERIMENT The samples are 16 and 32 ply thick dog bone shaped panels manufactured by major aeronautic companies. Each sample is 122 cm long by 30. 5 cm wide. The thermoset composites consist of IM 7 fibers embedded in a 5260 matrix and the thermoplastic composites consist of IM 7 fibers embedded in K 3 B matrix. Figure 1 illustrates one example of the flight load and temperature profile to which these composite samples are exposed. The flight load is expressed in terms of microstrain. Strain and temperature curves represent runway loads, climbing and descending loads and cruising loads. The low strain profile peaks near 2000 µstrain. The high strain profile peaks near 3000 µstrain. The temperature profile for the samples reported here reaches a peak temperature of 28...|$|R
40|$|High {{frequency}} (> 20 MHz) ultrasound has numerous potential {{applications in}} dermatology {{because of its}} ability to penetrate several millimeters into the skin and provide information at a spatial resolution of tens of microns. However, conventional B-scan images of skin tissues often lack the capability to characterize and differentiate various skin tissues. In this work, quantitative ultrasonic methods using the attenuation coefficient, backscatter coefficient, and echo envelope statistics were studied for their potential to characterize human skin tissues in vivo. A high frequency ultrasound system was developed using polymer transducers, a pulser/receiver, high-speed digitizer, 3 -axis scanning system, and a PC. Data collected using three different transducers with center frequencies of 28, 30 and 44 MHz were processed to determine the characteristics of normal human dermis and subcutaneous fat. Attenuation coefficients were obtained by computing spectral slopes vs. depth, with the transducers axially translated to minimize diffraction effects. Backscatter coefficients were obtained by compensating recorded backscatter spectra for system-dependent effects, and additionally for one transducer, using the reference phantom technique. Good agreement was seen between the results from the different transducers/methods. The attenuation coefficients were well described by a linear frequency dependence whose slope showed significant differences between the forearm and fingertip dermis, but not between the forearm dermis and fat. The backscatter coefficient of the dermis showed an increasing trend with frequency and was significantly higher than that of fat. (cont.) A maximum likelihood fit of six probability distributions (Rayleigh, Rician, K, Nakagami, Weibull, and Generalized Gamma) to fluctuations in echo envelope data showed that the Generalized Gamma distribution modeled the envelope better than the other distributions. Fat was seen to exhibit significantly more pre-Rayleigh behavior than the dermis. Data were also obtained from the skin of patients patch-tested for contact dermatitis. A significant increase in skin thickness, decrease in mean backscatter of the upper dermis, and decrease in <b>attenuation</b> coefficient <b>slope</b> was found at the affected sites compared to normal skin. However, no differences in terms of echo statistics were found in the mid-dermis. These results indicate that a combination of ultrasonic parameters have the potential to non-invasively characterize skin tissues. by Balasundara I. Raju. Thesis (Ph. D.)

30|$|Early in this study, {{it became}} clear that {{parasitoid}} loads varied among the population samples. One possible cause of such variation is superparasitism, which, for gregarious parasitoids such as E. erro, is expected to occur more often when unparasitized hosts are rare (Godfray 1994). Unparasitized hosts are rare when parasitism rates are high, so to test for this causal relationship, I used simple linear regression to evaluate whether high host parasitism rates corresponded with high parasitoid loads. For this analysis, each data point was the estimated mean host parasitoid load and parasitism rate for a single study site in a given year. Yearly population samples for which fewer than three parasitized cicadas were available to estimate the mean parasitoid load were excluded from the analysis. Parasitism rate was used as the explanatory (i.e., x-axis) variable, and because parasitism rates were estimated from population samples, some of which were small, there was the possibility of substantial measurement error. Consequently, the regression analysis was likely to suffer from <b>slope</b> <b>attenuation</b> bias, in which the slope estimator is biased to be less than the true slope (Bulmer 1979; Smith 2009). To compensate for this, I used the sizes of each population sample to estimate the mean measurement error variance across all population samples. I then used this estimate of the error variance with the method of moments estimator (MME) of the bias correction factor (Carroll and Ruppert 1996; Smith 2009) to calculate an attenuation-corrected slope estimate. Diagnostic plots of the standardized residuals were used to verify the fit of the simple linear regression model.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} multiwavelength study (from rest-frame ultraviolet to far-infrared) of narrow-band selected, star-forming (SF) Hα emitters (HAEs) at z ∼ 2. 23 {{taken from the}} High-Redshift(Z) Emission Line Survey (HiZELS). We find that HAEs have similar properties and colours derived from spectral energy distributions as sBzK galaxies, and probe a well-defined portion of the SF population at z ∼ 2. This is not true for Lyα emitters (LAEs), which are strongly biased towards blue, less massive galaxies (missing {{a significant percentage of}} the SF population). Combining our Hα observations with matched, existing Lyα data, we determine that the Lyα escape fraction (fesc) is low (only ∼ 4. 5 [*]per[*]cent of HAEs show Lyα emission) and decreases with increasing dust <b>attenuation,</b> ultraviolet continuum <b>slope,</b> stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). This suggests that Lyα preferentially escapes from blue galaxies with low dust attenuation. However, a small population of red and massive LAEs is also present, in agreement with previous works and indicating that dust and Lyα are not mutually exclusive. Using different and completely independent measures of the total SFR, we show that the Hα emission is an excellent tracer of star formation at z ∼ 2 with deviations typically lower than 0. 3 dex for individual galaxies. We find that the slope and zero-point of the HAE main sequence at z ∼ 2 strongly depend on the dust-correction method used to recover the SFR, although they are consistent with previous works when similar assumptions are made...|$|R
