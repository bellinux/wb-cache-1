6000|$|... 2. The {{historical}} mode is a {{very common}} one: in it the author professes {{to find out the}} truth by collecting the facts of the case, and tracing them downwards; but this mode is worse than the other. Suppose the question is as to the true essence and character of the English constitution. First, where will you begin your collection of facts? where will you end it? What facts will you select, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that the class of facts which you select are necessary terms in the premisses, and that other classes of facts, which you neglect, are not necessary? And how do you distinguish phenomena which proceed from disease or accident from those which are the genuine fruits of the essence of the constitution? What can be more striking, in illustration of the utter inadequacy of this line of investigation for arriving at the real truth, than the political treatises and constitutional histories which we have in every library? A Whig proves his case convincingly to the reader who knows nothing beyond his author; then comes an old Tory (Carte, for instance), and ferrets up a hamperful of conflicting documents and notices, which proves his case per contra. A. takes this class of facts; B. takes that class: each proves something true, neither proves the truth, or any thing like the truth; that is, the whole truth.|$|E

The Indians told me he gave poor Four Eyes an awful talking to. Then there were Tristan and Iseult--two Iseults. It was very sad. But I should like to love that way. Do all the young {{men and women in the}} world do that? They do not here. They just get married. They do not seem to have time. I am English, and I will never marry an Indian--would you? That is why I have not lighted my maiden's fire. Some of the young men are bothering father to make me do it. Libash is one of them. He is a great hunter. And Mahkook comes around singing songs. He is funny. To-night, if you come by my tent after dark, you will hear him singing out in the cold. But father says I can do as I please, and so I shall not light my fire. You see, when a girl makes up her mind to get married, that is the way she lets young men know. Four Eyes always said it was a fine custom. But I noticed he never took a wife. Maybe he was too old. He did not have much hair, but I do not think he was really very old. <b>And</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> when you are in love?--like Paolo and Francesca, I mean." ...|$|E
6000|$|By {{repeated}} pressure, however, Mulrady {{yielded the}} compromise that {{a portion of}} it should {{be made into a}} vineyard and flower-garden, and by a suitable coloring of ornament and luxury obliterate its vulgar part. Less successful, however, was that energetic woman in another effort to mitigate the austerities of their earlier state. It occurred to her to utilize the softer accents of Don Caesar in the pronunciation of their family name, and privately had [...] "Mulrade" [...] take the place of Mulrady on her visiting card. [...] "It might be Spanish," [...] she argued with her husband. [...] "Lawyer Cole says most American names are corrupted, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that yours ain't?" [...] Mulrady, who would not swear that his ancestors came from Ireland to the Carolinas in '98, was helpless to refute the assertion. But the terrible Nemesis of an un-Spanish, American provincial speech avenged the orthographical outrage at once. When Mrs. Mulrady began to be addressed orally, as well as by letter, as [...] "Mrs. Mulraid," [...] and when simple amatory effusions to her daughter rhymed with [...] "lovely maid," [...] she promptly refused the original vowel. But she fondly clung to the Spanish courtesy which transformed her husband's baptismal name, and usually spoke of him--in his absence--as [...] "Don Alvino." [...] But in the presence of his short, square figure, his orange tawny hair, his twinkling gray eyes, and retrousse nose, even that dominant woman withheld his title. It was currently reported at Red Dog that a distinguished foreigner had one day approached Mulrady with the formula, [...] "I believe I have the honor of addressing Don Alvino Mulrady?" [...] "You kin bet your boots, stranger, that's me," [...] had returned that simple hidalgo.|$|E

Of all quaint deductions from experience, that is the quaintest! Would it not be more philosophical to conclude that I, who never saw or felt or heard this which I call myself, am what I have seen, heard, and felt--and no more and no less--that sensation which I call that horse, that dead man, that jackass, those forty thousand two-legged jackasses who appear to be running for their lives below there, having got hold of this same notion of their being one thing each--as I choose to fancy in my foolish habit of imputing to them the same disease of thought which I find in myself--crucify the word!--The folly of my ancestors--if I ever had any--prevents my having any better expression.... Why should I not be all I feel--that sky, those clouds--the whole universe? Hercules! what a creative genius my sensorium must be!--I'll take to writing' poetry--a mock-epic, in seventy-two books, entitled [...] "The Universe: or, Raphael Aben-Ezra," [...] and take Homer's Margites for my model. Homer's? Mine! Why must not the Margites, like everything else, have been a sensation of my own? Hypatia used to say Homer's poetry was a part of her.... only she could not prove it.... but I have proved that the Margites is a part of me.... not that I believe my own proof--scepticism forbid! Oh, would to heaven that the said whole disagreeable universe were annihilated, if it were only just to settle by fair experiment whether any of master [...] "I" [...] remained when they were gone!

50|$|Considered a {{pioneering}} writer on Islam and contemporary cultural issues, he has produced some fifty books {{over a period}} of 30 years, some with his long-time co-author Merryl Wyn Davies. These books include the classic studies The Future of Muslim Civilisation (1979) and Islamic Futures: The Shape of Ideas to Come (1985), a vigorous intellectual assault on postmodern thought, Postmodernism and the Other (1998) and Orientalism (1999), and the international bestseller Why Do People Hate America? (2002). He has published two highly acclaimed books on cities: The Consumption of Kuala Lumpur (2000) and Mecca: The Sacred City, which won the first prize at the Lahore Literature Festival in 2014 and the Ramnath Goenka Award for Excellence in Journalism for a non-fiction book. Two collections of his essays and critical writings are available as readers: Islam, Postmodernism and Other Futures: A Ziauddin Sardar Reader (2003) <b>and</b> <b>How</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Know?</b> Reading Ziauddin Sardar on Islam, Science and Cultural Relations (2006). His two volumes of autobiography, Desperately Seeking Paradise: Journeys of a Sceptical Muslim and Balti Britain: A Provocative Journey Through Asian Britain, have been highly praised. His latest book Reading the Qur’an presents a humanist and pluralist reading of the sacred text of Islam.|$|E
5000|$|Also in 547, Gao Huan {{died and}} was succeeded as regent by Gao Cheng. Gao Cheng {{immediately}} faced a major rebellion {{by the general}} Hou Jing, and Hulü was sent to serve under Murong Shaozong (慕容紹宗), {{the commander of the}} forces Gao Cheng sent against Hou. In a rare case where Hulü might have exhibited some uncharacteristic overexuberance, when Murong and his lieutenant Liu Fengsheng (劉豐生) were initially defeated by Hou, Hulü and his fellow junior general Zhang Shixian (張恃顯) rebuked Murong and Liu for their defeat. Murong responded, [...] "I have met many opponents, but none is as difficult as Hou. Why do you not try to engage him and see." [...] As Hulü and Zhang rode out to engage Hou, however, Murong warned them, [...] "Do not cross the Guo River (渦水)." [...] (Murong's troops and Hou's troops were by this point stalemated across the Guo River.) When Hulü challenged Hou by showing his bow and arrows but did not cross the Guo, Hou told him, [...] "You came for glory, but I am trying to leave in fear of death. I am your father's friend. Why shoot at me? <b>And</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> not to cross the Guo? It must be Murong Shaozong who taught you." [...] Hulü was unable to respond, and Hou subsequently had his subordinate Tian Qian (田遷) shoot and kill Hulü's horse, and Hulü was forced to withdraw. Hou then captured Zhang but released him, and both Hulü and Zhang fled back to Murong's camp. Murong then stated, [...] "What have you seen now? Do not rebuke me." [...] (In spring 548, Murong defeated Hou, who was forced to flee to Liang Dynasty. Historical records do not indicate whether Hulü contributed to the victory.) ...|$|E
