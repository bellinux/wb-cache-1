5000|$|Book Four of De Doctrina Christiana {{has sparked}} {{a great deal}} of debate among {{scholars}} with regards {{to the extent to which}} Saint Augustine’s work has been influenced by the rules and traditions of classical rhetoric, and more specifically by the writings of Cicero. In the final chapter of On Christian Doctrine, Augustine uses much of Cicero’s rhetorical theory as he lays down the foundation for the proper use of rhetoric by Christian teachers. For example, <b>Augustine</b> <b>quotes</b> Cicero (Orat. 21. 69.) when he writes, “a certain eloquent man said, and said truly, that he who is eloquent should speak in such a way that he teaches, delights, and moves.” ...|$|R
5000|$|With {{respect to}} the first three, St. <b>Augustine</b> <b>quotes</b> from them and {{directly}} credits their authorship to St. Ambrose. He appears also to refer to No. 4 (the third verse in whose fourth strophe is: Geminœ Gigas substantiœ) when he says: [...] "This going forth of our Giant Gigantis is briefly and beautifully hymned by Blessed Ambrose ..." [...] And Faustus, Bishop of Riez (A. D. 455), quotes from it and names the Saint as author, as does also Cassiodorus (died 575) in quoting the fourth strophe entire. Pope St. Celestine, in the council held at Rome in 430, also cites it as by St. Ambrose. Internal evidence for No. 1 is found in many verbal and phrasal correspondences between strophes 4-7 and the [...] "Hexaëmeron" [...] of the Saint. Of these four hymns, only No. 1 is now found in the Roman Breviary. It is sung at Lauds on Sunday from the Octave of the Epiphany to the first Sunday in Lent, and from the Sunday nearest to {{the first day of}} October until Advent. There are sixteen translations into English, of which that by Cardinal Newman is given in the Marquess of Bute's Breviary. No. 2 has eight English renderings; No. 3, two; No. 4, twenty-four.|$|R

2500|$|Newman's {{influence}} in Oxford was supreme {{about the year}} 1839.

50|$|When Julian {{addressed}} his {{two letters}} to Zosimus {{he was preparing}} a reply to the first of Augustine's two books de Nuptiis et Concupiscentia, which he addressed to a fellow-recusant named Turbantius, whose prayers he earnestly asks that the church may be delivered from the defilement of Manicheism. He sent some extracts from the work, which was in four books, and apparently entitled Contra eos qui nuptias damnant et fructus earum diabolo assignant, to Valerius, who forwarded them to his friend Augustine, who at once rejoined in a second book de Nuptiis et Concupiscentia. When Julian's work subsequently came into his hands, Augustine published a fuller rejoinder in his contra Julianum Pelagianum. <b>Augustine</b> freely <b>quotes</b> his antagonist, and Julian again insisted upon the Manicheism of his opponents; again charged Zosimus with prevarication, and elaborated the whole anthropology for which he contended.|$|R
5000|$|Without naming it explicitly, Redemptor hominis {{confronts the}} system of atheist-based Communism, such as that found in his native Poland, an [...] "atheism that is programmed, organized, and {{structured}} as a political system." [...] John Paul confronts this on the philosophical level as inherently inhuman. Citing <b>Augustine's</b> famous <b>quote</b> of [...] "You made us for yourself, Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in you," [...] John Paul argues that the human person naturally strives for God (as understood through whatever religion) as the full dimension of humanity. Thus, he states, systems such as Communism that deny this essential aspect of human nature are fundamentally flawed and inherently unable to satisfy the deepest human longings for the fullest expression of human life. This lays a philosophical underpinning to the pope's own remarkably successful actions confronting Communism in the political field.|$|R
5000|$|But it was {{not always}} enough merely to adopt the teachings of <b>Augustine</b> and to <b>quote</b> him; the author of the regula Tarnatensis (an unknown monastery in the Rhone valley) {{introduced}} into his work the entire text of the letter addressed to the nuns, having previously adapted it to a community of men by making slight modifications.

500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, it {{has been}} suggested that King [...] "Aduluald" [...] in the letter to Justus is a real king Æthelwald, perhaps a junior king of west Kent. In that case it would appear that Laurence converted Eadbald, and Justus converted Æthelwald. It has also been suggested that the pallium did not indicate Justus was archbishop, since Justus is told the limited circumstances in which he may wear it; however, the same phrasing occurs in the letter conveying the pallium to Archbishop <b>Augustine,</b> also <b>quoted</b> in Bede. Another possibility is that the letter was originally two letters. In this view, Bede has conflated the letter conveying the pallium with the letter congratulating Justus on the conversion, which according to Bede's account was seven or so years earlier; but the grammatical details on which this suggestion is based are not unique to this letter, and as a result it is usually considered to be a single composition.|$|R

50|$|Jean Mabillon {{believed}} the missal {{to be of}} the Frankish tradition. He cited the collections post nomina, ad pacem and the formula of the Contestatio as being characteristic of Gallican Liturgy. He also cited similarities between the Bobbio missal and the Missale Gothicum/Gallicanum and the Lectionary of Luxeuil. The order of some significant feast days were also similar to the Gallican tradition, and this also excluded it from being of the Mozarabic, Ambrosian or Roman tradition. The order of the liturgy in the Bobbio missal, such as the placement of the scripture readings and the Pax Vobiscum is also such as to distinguish it from the African tradition (here Mabillon <b>quotes</b> <b>Augustine</b> to support his deductions).|$|R

[...] Now there are two rules of the human will: one is proximate and homogeneous, viz. the human reason; {{the other is the}} first rule, viz. the eternal law, which is God's reason, so to speak (quasi ratio Dei). Accordingly Augustine includes two things in the definition of sin; one, pertaining to the substance of a human act, and which is the matter, so to speak, of sin, when he says, word, deed, or desire; the other, pertaining to the nature of evil, and which is the form, as it were, of sin, when he says, contrary to the eternal law.

5000|$|Augustine has {{influenced}} many modern-day theologians and authors such as John Piper. Hannah Arendt, an influential 20th-century political theorist, wrote her doctoral dissertation in philosophy on Augustine, {{and continued to}} rely on his thought throughout her career. Ludwig Wittgenstein extensively <b>quotes</b> <b>Augustine</b> in Philosophical Investigations for his approach to language, both admiringly, and as a sparring partner to develop his own ideas, including an extensive opening passage from the Confessions. Contemporary linguists have argued that Augustine has significantly influenced the thought of Ferdinand de Saussure, who did not 'invent' the modern discipline of semiotics, but rather built upon Aristotelian and Neoplatonist knowledge from the Middle Ages, via an Augustinian connection: [...] "as for the constitution of Saussurian semiotic theory, {{the importance of the}} Augustinian thought contribution (correlated to the Stoic one) has also been recognized.

To the truth of both propositions we have the attestation of the Apostle, 'God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us,' (Rom. 5: 8.)

40|$|In his {{contribution}} to the volume entitled The Social and Political Ideas of Some Great Medieval Thinkers, A. J. Carlyle treats of the place of St. Augustine {{in the history of}} political thought. In general he regards Augustine as a typical representative of Patristic thought, and finds his significance in the history of political ideas to lie in his re-statement of the traditional view of the Stoics and the Christian Fathers. On only one point does Carlyle find Augustine differing from the Stoic-Patristic tradition. It is the question of the relation of the state to justice. <b>Augustine</b> had <b>quoted</b> Cicero's definition of a people: "A people is not every rabblement of the multitude, but a society gathered together in one consent of law, and in one participation of profit. " According to Carlyle, Augustine interpreted Cicero correctly as meaning {{that there can be no}} state where there is no justice, because there can be no law where there is no justice. But Augustine, unable to allow that a pagan state was just, found it impossible to apply Cicero's definition, and searched about for another which would not make justice an essential part of the state. [ [...] . ] It shall be the purpose of this thesis, then, to examine once more Augustine's teaching respecting the nature of the state with a view to discovering whether he really meant that justice is not an essential element in its constitution, and, if not, what he proposed the bond of society to be.

5000|$|In the Catholic Encyclopedia (1907) Hugh Pope {{discusses}} some of {{the confusion}} that arose regarding the term. He writes [...] "The earlier Fathers, going by {{the letter of the}} text in the Septuagint, maintained that it was God Himself who appeared as the Giver of the Law to Moses. It was not unnatural then for Tertullian, ... to regard such manifestations in the light of preludes to the Incarnation, and most of the Eastern Fathers followed the same line of thought." [...] He quotes the view of Theodoret that this angel was probably Christ, [...] "the Only-begotten Son, the Angel of great Counsel", and contrasts Theodoret's view with the opposite view of the Latin Fathers St. Jerome, St. Augustine, and St. Gregory the Great, which, he says, [...] "was destined to live in the Church, and the Scholastics reduced it to a system". As an exponent of this view he <b>quotes</b> <b>Augustine</b> of Hippo, who declared that [...] "the angel is correctly termed an angel if we consider him himself, but equally correctly is he termed 'the Lord' because God dwells in him." [...] The visual form under which God appeared and spoke to men is referred to indifferently in some Old Testament texts either as God's angel or as God himself.|$|R

60|$|When {{it comes}} to {{establishing}} his position Thyraeus most provokingly says, 'we omit cases which are recent and of daily occurrence,' such as he heard narrated, during his travels, in 'a certain haunted castle'. A modern inquirer naturally prefers recent examples, which may be inquired into, but the old scholars reposed more confidence in what was written by respected authors, the more ancient the more authoritative. However Thyraeus relies on the anthropological test of evidence, and thinks that his belief is confirmed by the coincident reports of hauntings, 'variis distinctissimisque locis et temporibus,' in the most various times and places. There {{is something to be}} said for this view, and the identity of the alleged phenomena, in all lands and ages, does raise a presumption in favour of some kind of abnormal occurrences, or of a common species of hallucinations. Like most of the old authors Thyraeus <b>quotes</b> <b>Augustine's</b> tale of a haunted house, and an exorcism in De Civitate Dei (lib. xxii. ch. viii.). St. Gregory has also a story of one Paschasius, a deacon, who haunted some baths, and was seen by a bishop. {131a} There is a ghost who rode horses, and frightened the religious in the Life of Gregory by Joannes Diaconus (iv. 89). In the Life of Theodorus one Georgius, a disciple of his, mentions a house haunted by stone-throwing sprites, a very common phenomenon in the books of Glanvill, and Increase Mather, in witch trials, and in rural disturbances. Omitting other examples Cardan {131b} is cited for a house at Parma, in which during a hundred years the phantom of an old woman was seen before the death of members of the family. This is a rare case of an Italian Banshie. William of Paris, in Bodin (iii. ch. vi.) tells of a stone-throwing fiend, very active in 1447. The bogey of Bingen, a rapping ghost of 856, is duly chronicled; he also threw stones. The dormitory of some nuns was haunted by a spectre who moaned, tramped noisily around, dragged the sisters out of bed by the feet, and even tickled them nearly to death! This annoyance lasted for three years, so Wierus says. {132} Wodrow chronicles a similar affair at Mellantrae, in Annandale. Thyraeus distinguishes three kinds of haunting sprites, devils, damned souls, and souls in purgatory. Some are mites, mild and sportive; some are truculenti ferocious. Brownies, or fauni, may act in either character, as Secutores et joculatores. They rather aim at teasing than at inflicting harm. They throw stones, lift beds, and make a hubbub and crash with the furniture. Suicides, murderers, and spirits of murdered people, are all apt to haunt houses. The sprites occasionally appear in their proper form, but just as often in disguise: a demon, too, can appear in human shape if so disposed: demons being of their nature deceitful and fond of travesty, as Porphyry teaches us and as Law (1680) illustrates. Whether the spirits of the dead quite know what they are about when they take to haunting, is, in the opinion of Thyraeus, a difficult question. Thomas Aquinas, following St. Augustine, inclines to hold that when there is an apparition of a dead man, the dead man is unconscious of the circumstance. A spirit of one kind or another may be acting in his semblance. Thyraeus rather fancies that the dead man is aware of what is going on.|$|R
40|$|The {{title of}} this project should not sit easily with the reader. The {{bringing}} together a Roman Bishop from the fourth century with the twentieth century Marxist philosopher certainly seems counter-intuitive; however bringing them together has potential to bring out certain aspects of their writings, which would otherwise go unexamined. In their book, The Dialectic of Enlightenment, Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer develop Marx’s concept of alienated consciousness, which Adorno further clarifies in later essays and lectures. In this project I will explore this development from consciousness, which is alienated through economic circumstances (Marx) to a consciousness that is fundamentally alienated through the genesis of consciousness itself. Generally understood, this alienation can be simply described as alienation from nature, from others, and from self, which is remarkably similar to the Augustine’s conception of the fallen man, wherein {{the effects of the}} fall can be simply described as alienation from self, from others, from nature, and adding the theological aspect: alienation from God. The purpose of this project is to explore, examine, and analyze the origins and phenomenology of these two conceptions of humanity’s existential state. The obvious point of contact between these two thinkers is the question of progress. Indeed, Adorno himself <b>quotes</b> <b>Augustine</b> his essay titled “On Progress” in his Critical Models. Such work has been investigated indirectly by Adorno’s student, Karl Heinz Haag, who inspired Adorno’s short dialogue with Augustine, in his Forschritt der Philosophie, and has been directly addressed by Peter Uwe Hohendahl in “Progress Revisited: Adorno 2 ̆ 7 s Dialogue with Augustine, Kant, and Benjamin. ” The choice to begin the dialogue between these two thinkers on the level of self, however is a conscious decision to attempt to create a more intense investigation into intersections of theology and critical theory that can potentially lay the ground-work for future projects of a similar nature. Hoffman 4 I first began conceptualizing this project over two years ago, when I read the Dialectic of Enlightenment for the first time. I recognized Adorno’s brilliance in the vigor of his critique of the culture industry; however I felt that a dimension was missing from his paradigm—a dimension of theological speculation. In its foundations, this project was oriented toward a theological expansion of this critique by outlining the pervasiveness of the culture industry as having spiritual implications, as well as material. As I began to ponder how this project could be accomplished I realized I would have to begin by displaying the similarities between Adorno’s understanding of alienation and a Christian understanding of original sin. Defining a single Christian conception of original sin that could be set next to Adorno proved to be beyond the extent of this project and so I chose a thinker, whose conception of fallenness seemed to most closely pair with Adorno’s thought—Augustine. There are obvious theoretical issues with attempting a synthesis of Adorno and ancient Christian theology. The first and potentially most problematic issue with attempting this synthesis is the stark contrast between Adorno’s metaphysical position of historical materialism and Augustine’s position of strict theism and belief in the immaterial soul. I circumvent this problem through a phenomenological approach, through which I can compare these theories’ phenomenological accounts of alienation, which would avoid the problem of metaphysics. This problem cannot, of course be completely ignored and I will acknowledge the critical differences in the discussion of the similarities. Originally, this project was conceived as proposing a synthesis of the two thinkers, but after beginning my investigation, I chose to begin by simply showing the parallels in thought between Adorno and Augustine. I position Adorno’s understanding of alienated consciousness within the tradition of Marxism, in order to justify the theological engagement with Adorno, specifically. I will then provide a thorough, in depth Hoffman 5 phenomenological analysis of Adorno’s concept of consciousness, how it emerges as alienated, and how it becomes reified by the culture Industry, while working predominantly with the Dialectic of Enlightenment, “The Culture Industry Revisited,” and the essay, which is central to this portion of the project, “On Subject and Object. ” After establishing a phenomenology of Adorno’s concept, the focus will switch to the Christian-side of things. I plan to explicate Augustine’s conception of the fallen man through his major works, such as Confessions, City of God, On the Trinity, among other minor texts. I also will engage with limited secondary literature on Augustine in order to justify the use of modern language within the context of Augustine’s ancient writings. The third portion of this project will consist in the critical discussion of the two conceptions, wherein I will critically analyze the similarities and differences of both Authors. The project will conclude with self-reflection and point toward the potential of future projects of a similar nature...|$|R
