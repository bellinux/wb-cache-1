5|$|On 22November 1941, during Operation Crusader, Rawlinson led No.3 Squadron on a bomber escort mission near Bir el Gubi in the morning, and {{a fighter}} sweep {{south-east}} of El Adem in the afternoon. German Messerschmitt Bf109 fighters shot down three Tomahawks {{for the loss}} of two of their own in the first action, Rawlinson claiming a 109 damaged. In the second action, a drawn-out battle for air superiority, the squadron lost six Tomahawks against two 109s destroyed, one of which was claimed by Rawlinson along with one probable and one damaged. He had also taken <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distant 109 and, believing he had missed it, did not claim. After the war it was established that Rawlinson's bullets had damaged the 109 and wounded its pilot, Ernst Düllberg, who made a forced landing back at base. Rawlinson was credited with his final victory on 30November, when he downed an Italian Macchi C.200 in an engagement that saw No.3 Squadron's tally of claims rise to 106 aircraft destroyed.|$|E

He hit two {{to the left}} field bleachers, two over the right field wall, and had <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> fifth homer with a deep fly to center, but center fielder Al Simmons snared it on a running catch. A's slugger Jimmie Foxx was also known for {{tape-measure}} blasts, especially during 1932 when he hit 58 home runs and challenged Ruth's season record of 60. Foxx was the all-time home run hitter at Shibe Park, with 195 round-trippers between 1927 and 1945.|$|E

25|$|The {{third season}} of NXT was {{exclusive}} for Divas. The {{majority of the}} season three cast was revealed on the second season finale on August 31, 2010. The first four episodes of season three were aired on Syfy. Due to the debut of SmackDown on Syfy in October 2010, NXT left the channel and became a webcast at WWE.com for visitors from the United States from the fifth episode onwards. AJ Lee, Naomi, Aloisia, Maxine, Aksana, and Jamie Keyes were initially announced {{as part of the}} show with Primo, Kelly Kelly, Vickie Guerrero, Alicia Fox, Goldust, and The Bella Twins as the select main roster talents featured on the show as 'mentors'. However, before the season's premiere aired, Aloisia was dropped from the show. On screen, Aloisia's exit stemmed from an argument between Aloisia and her pro, Vickie Guerrero, forcing Guerrero to fire her. In real life, she was released two weeks later, due to the company allegedly finding adult photos, and was replaced by Kaitlyn on the show. The reward to the victor was changed in contrast to the previous seasons. Unlike the first two male victors, the female victor of season 3 would not get <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> championship of her choice (the only title being the Divas Championship) but rather, a main roster spot.|$|E
500|$|On 2 January 1793, Childers was {{approaching}} {{the entrance to}} the roadstead under overcast skies and with a light, unreliable breeze. The only entrance to Brest harbour is through a narrow waterway known as the Goulet de Brest. The Goulet lies between the Pointe du Petit Minou and the Pointe du Portzic on the north shore and the îlot des Capucins and the Pointe des Espagnols on the Roscanvel peninsula to the south. Due to its importance as the entrance to Brest, the shores of the Goulet were heavily fortified. As Childers entered the Goulet one of the forts covering the entrance from the southern shore fired <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distance of [...] which passed over the brig into the sea beyond.|$|E
500|$|As Modell {{is taken}} {{away on a}} stretcher, Mulder arrives and thinks that Modell forced Skinner to shoot him on purpose {{in order to protect}} Linda Bowman. Scully says that Linda has been taken home, at which an annoyed Mulder leaves to see Modell in the {{hospital}}. A nurse enters the hospital room and tells Mulder that she has to change the patient's bandages. When Mulder leaves, it is revealed that the nurse is actually Linda Bowman wearing a paper with [...] "Nurse" [...] written on it. Linda then talks Modell's heart into stopping. A nurse runs past Mulder and he follows her into Modell's room, where Modell is pronounced dead. Mulder notices the [...] "Nurse" [...] paper has [...] "214 Channel Avenue" [...] on the back. That night, Mulder visits the address and finds Scully, pointing a gun at him and claiming to be controlled by Linda; she kills herself. Mulder hears footsteps behind him and turns around to see Linda Bowman pointing a gun at him; [...] "Linda" [...] states personal information about Mulder, revealing herself to indeed be Scully despite what Mulder sees. She fires <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> figure moving behind Mulder, and he then sees Scully in front of him, and a wounded Linda behind him. In Skinner's office, Linda Bowman's brain scan shows an advanced temporal lobe tumor, just like her fraternal twin, Robert Modell; the two had been separated at birth. Mulder has misgivings about nearly killing Scully and feels that he ultimately lost Linda's game.|$|E

5000|$|Even more so {{than other}} surface vessels in Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine (navy), the {{powerful}} German battleship Tirpitz served her entire career as a [...] "fleet in being" [...] in her own right. Although she never fired <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> enemy ship, her mere presence forced the Royal Navy to allocate powerful warships in defending Arctic convoys, and caused a major convoy (PQ-17) to scatter, suffering huge losses, mainly to U-boats and aircraft.|$|R
500|$|Producer Ron Hauge came up {{with the}} idea of someone {{shooting}} a bird and feeling guilty about it. Hauge told the staff a few weeks before Cohen started writing the episode that when he was 13 or 14 years old, he accidentally killed a bird after he got a Wrist Rocket slingshot, and took <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> bird that he thought was [...] "far, far away". Hauge said his friends were excited about it, but he was [...] "dying inside". For the scene in which the bird is killed, Cohen received further inspiration from an episode of The Andy Griffith Show entitled [...] "Opie the Birdman". The writers were trying to figure out a way to have Bart kill the bird without actually wanting to kill it, and decided to give the gun a crooked sight that Bart would be unaware of, so when Bart intentionally takes a shot at the right of the bird to avoid it, the bullet still hits the bird. After Bart kills the mother bird, he imagines himself before a bird court with a vulture, an eagle, and a toucan as judges. This sequence was added to [...] "liven up the visuals", because the writers thought the episode tended too heavily towards extreme realism and because most of the scenes in the episode were taking place in and around the Simpsons' house. Then-show runner Mike Scully had done the same thing with an episode he wrote for season seven called [...] "Marge Be Not Proud". In that episode, Bart gets caught shoplifting, and writer Bill Oakley suggested the addition of a fantasy sequence to get away from the realism in the episode.|$|E

The team also {{produced}} the Gators' first first-team All-American, end Dale Van Sickel, Florida's first member of the College Football Hall of Fame. Crabtree and Van Sickel were both unanimous All-Southern selections. Crabtree was ambidextrous and could throw passes with either hand or punt with either foot, while on the run or stationary, The 1928 team's sole loss was to Robert Neyland's Tennessee, 12–13, in the final game of the season.
