5|$|All of the Peano axioms {{except the}} ninth <b>axiom</b> (the {{induction}} <b>axiom)</b> are statements in first-order logic. The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication {{and the order}} relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The <b>axiom</b> of induction is in second-order, since it quantifies over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), {{but it can be}} transformed into a first-order <b>axiom</b> schema of induction. Such a schema includes one <b>axiom</b> per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order <b>axiom.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Zermelo {{published}} his <b>axiom</b> system for set theory.

Zermelo had proved this theorem in 1904 using the <b>axiom</b> of choice, but his proof was criticized {{for a variety of}} reasons. His response to the criticism included his <b>axiom</b> system and a new proof of the well-ordering theorem. His axioms support this new proof, and they eliminate the paradoxes by restricting the formation of sets.|$|E
5|$|Peano {{arithmetic}} is equiconsistent {{with several}} weak systems of set theory. One such system is ZFC with the <b>axiom</b> of infinity replaced by its negation. Another such system consists of general set theory (extensionality, {{existence of the}} empty set, and the <b>axiom</b> of adjunction), augmented by an <b>axiom</b> schema stating that a property that holds for the empty set and holds of an adjunction whenever it holds of the adjunct must hold for all sets.|$|E

5|$|Every {{vector space}} has a basis. This follows from Zorn's lemma, an {{equivalent}} {{formulation of the}} <b>Axiom</b> of Choice. Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases {{is equivalent to the}} <b>axiom</b> of choice. The ultrafilter lemma, which is weaker than the <b>axiom</b> of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or cardinality (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces). It is called the dimension of the vector space, denoted by dim V. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, John von Neumann {{developed}} an <b>axiom</b> system that eliminates the paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a class is too big to be a set {{if it can be}} put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all sets. This <b>axiom</b> implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. Von Neumann also used his <b>axiom</b> to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his <b>axiom</b> provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the class of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's <b>axiom.</b>|$|E

40|$|The paper {{suggests}} {{the concepts of}} an upper entropy and a lower entropy. We propose a new axiomatic definition, namely, upper entropy <b>axioms,</b> inspired by <b>axioms</b> of metric spaces, and also formulate lower entropy <b>axioms.</b> We also develop weak upper entropy <b>axioms</b> and weak lower entropy <b>axioms.</b> Their conditions are weaker than those of Shannon-Khinchin <b>axioms</b> and Tsallis <b>axioms,</b> while these conditions are stronger {{than those of the}} axiomatics based on the first three Shannon-Khinchin <b>axioms</b> for superstatiscs. The expansibility, subadditivity and strong subadditivity of entropy are obtained in the new axiomatics. Tsallis statistics is a special case of the superstatistics which satisfies our <b>axioms.</b> Moreover, different forms of information measures, such as Shannon entropy, Daroczy entropy, Tsallis entropy and other entropies, can be unified under the same axiomatic framework.

5|$|The axiomatization of mathematics, on {{the model}} of Euclid's Elements, had reached new levels of rigour and breadth {{at the end of the}} 19th century, {{particularly}} in arithmetic, thanks to the <b>axiom</b> schema of Richard Dedekind and Charles Sanders Peirce, and in geometry, thanks to Hilbert's axioms. But at the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to Russell's paradox (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves). The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics, but they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets—the <b>axiom</b> of foundation and the notion of class.|$|E
5|$|WALL-E (stylized with an interpunct as WALL·E) is a 2008 American computer-animated {{science fiction}} film {{produced}} by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton, produced by Jim Morris, and co-written by Jim Reardon. It stars {{the voices of}} Ben Burtt, Elissa Knight, Jeff Garlin, Fred Willard, John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy, Sigourney Weaver, and the MacInTalk system, and was the overall ninth feature film produced by the company.

5|$|WALL-E was {{the most}} complex Pixar {{production}} since Monsters, Inc. because {{of the world and}} the history that had to be conveyed. Whereas most Pixar films have up to 75,000 storyboards, WALL-E required 125,000. Production designer Ralph Eggleston wanted the lighting of the first act on Earth to be romantic, and that of the second act on the <b>Axiom</b> to be cold and sterile. During the third act, the romantic lighting is slowly introduced into the <b>Axiom</b> environment. Pixar studied Chernobyl and the city of Sofia to create the ruined world; art director Anthony Christov was from Bulgaria and recalled Sofia used to have problems storing its garbage. Eggleston bleached out the whites on Earth to make WALL-E feel vulnerable. The overexposed light makes the location look more vast. Because of the haziness, the cubes making up the towers of garbage had to be large, otherwise they would have lost shape (in turn, this helped save rendering time). The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a Christmas tree. Eggleston tried to avoid the colors yellow and green so WALL-E—who was made yellow to emulate a tractor—would not blend into the deserted Earth, and to make the plant more prominent.|$|E
