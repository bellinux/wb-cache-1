25|$|Sir, I {{have the}} honor of informing you that I have arrived in this port with a {{commission}} from the Supreme Government of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata to take possession of these islands {{on behalf of the}} country to which they belong by Natural Law. While carrying out this mission I want to do so with all the courtesy and respect all friendly nations; one of the objectives of my mission is to prevent the destruction of resources necessary for all ships passing by and forced to cast anchor here, as well as to help them to obtain the necessary supplies, with minimum expenses and inconvenience. Since your presence here is not in competition with these purposes and in the belief that a personal meeting will be fruitful for both of us, I invite you to come aboard, where you'll be welcomed to stay as long as you wish; I would also greatly <b>appreciate</b> <b>your</b> extending this invitation to any other British subject found in the vicinity; I am, respectfully yours. Signed, Jewett, Colonel of the Navy of the United Provinces of South America and commander of the frigate Heroína.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{his career}} Monteux {{suffered}} from being {{thought of as}} a specialist in French music. The music that meant most to him was that of German composers, particularly Brahms, but this was often overlooked by concert promoters and recording companies. Of the four Brahms symphonies, he was invited by the recording companies to record only one, the Second. Recordings of his live performances of the First and Third have been released on CD, but the discography in Canarina's biography lists no recording, live or from the studio, of the Fourth. The critic William Mann, along with many others, regarded him as a [...] "supremely authoritative" [...] conductor of Brahms, though Cardus disagreed: [...] "In German music Monteux, naturally enough, missed harmonic weight and the right heavily lunged tempo. His rhythm, for example, was a little too pointed for, say, Brahms or Schumann." [...] Gramophones reviewer Jonathan Swain contends that no conductor knew more than Monteux about expressive possibilities in the strings, claiming that [...] "the conductor who doesn't play a stringed instrument simply doesn't know how to get the different sounds; and the bow has such importance in string playing that there are maybe 50 different ways of producing the same note"; In his 2003 biography, John Canarina lists nineteen [...] "significant world premieres" [...] conducted by Monteux. In addition to Petrushka and The Rite of Spring is a further Stravinsky work, The Nightingale. Monteux's other premieres for Diaghilev included Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé and Debussy's Jeux. In the concert hall he premiered works by, among others, Milhaud, Poulenc and Prokofiev. In a letter of April 1914 Stravinsky wrote [...] "everyone can <b>appreciate</b> <b>your</b> zeal and your probity in regard to the contemporary works of various tendencies that you have had occasion to defend." ...|$|E

[...] Tancredo replied in a letter, [...] "I certainly understand and <b>appreciate</b> <b>your</b> need and desire to try and create the illusion of Miami as a multiethnic 'All American' city," [...] he said. [...] "I can also appreciate ... that the cultural and ethnic diversity of the city offers many advantages to its residents.

2500|$|In January 2006, CNN Headline News {{president}} Ken Jautz hired conservative {{talk radio}} host Glenn Beck {{to host a}} primetime commentary and interview show on the network, which premiered on May 8, 2006. Jautz stated that Beck was [...] "cordial," [...] and that his radio show was [...] "conversational, not confrontational." [...] However, Media Matters for America and FAIR have reported that Beck {{had a history of}} making controversial statements on his radio program, including calling former President Jimmy Carter a [...] "waste of skin", hoping for the deaths of Dennis Kucinich and Michael Moore, and telling a caller who claimed to have tortured foreign prisoners for the U.S. military, [...] "I <b>appreciate</b> <b>your</b> service" [...] (Beck left CNN on October 16, 2008 to join Fox News Channel, where he hosted a similar commentary/interview program that ran until 2011).|$|E
2500|$|Due to his {{training}} in three Japanese lineages, Maezumi employed both Rinzai kōan study and Sōtō shikantaza in his teaching curriculum—an approach developed by his teacher Hakuun Yasutani. He {{was known to}} be especially strict about the posture of his students while sitting zazen. Maezumi used a range of kōans from different Zen traditions, including the Blue Cliff Record, The Gateless Gate, Transmission of the Lamp, and the Book of Equanimity. According to author and Dharma Successor Gerry Shishin Wick, Maezumi was also fond of a particular saying—"appreciate your life." [...] This also is the title of a compiled book of teachings by Maezumi, published by Shambhala Publications. In it Maezumi says, [...] "I encourage you. Please enjoy this wonderful life together. Appreciate the world just this! There is nothing extra. Genuinely <b>appreciate</b> <b>your</b> life as the most precious treasure and take good care of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Military law {{requires}} commanding officers {{and those in}} authority to demonstrate virtue, honor, patriotism, and subordination in all that they do. In the 1990s, the army officially adopted what {{have come to be}} known as [...] "The 7 Army Values", which are summarized with the acronym [...] "LDRSHIP". LDRSHIP stands for Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage. While this acronym is relatively new, the ideas it represents have been at the heart of military service for generations. Similarly, the motto [...] "Duty, honor, country" [...] is the standard of the U.S. military. Military brats are raised in a culture that stresses LDRSHIP, Duty, Honor, and Country. Their strict (outward) adherence to military values is what separates most from their civilian peers. Children of military personnel often mirror the values, ideals, and attitudes of their parents more than children of civilians. Marine General Peter Pace, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a 2006 interview, [...] "There's no way, in my mind, that you can be successful in the military and have a family unless that family does, in fact, <b>appreciate</b> <b>your</b> service to the country." [...] Pace also wrote in an April 2006 letter honoring the Month of the Military Child: [...] "You [...] are American patriots and role models for us all." ...|$|E

2500|$|The April 5, 2008 Saturday Night Live {{show was}} the first time an episode hosted by Walken did not have a [...] "Continental" [...] sketch or a {{monologue}} in which he sang and danced. This episode, however, did include one sketch titled [...] "Meet the Family", which spoofs many of Walken's idiosyncrasies. The sketch depicts a fictional Walken family reunion, where all of Christopher's relatives have his mannerisms and speech patterns, and sport his trademark pompadour hairstyle. In order of appearance, the other Walkens are Christopher's cousin Stanley (Bill Hader); Stanley's brother John (Jason Sudeikis); John's son Scott (Andy Samberg) and daughter Maxine (Amy Poehler) (who carries a doll that also has a pompadour); Nathan (Fred Armisen), a gay relative for whom [...] "flamboyance" [...] means dressing all in black and running his finger around the rim of a cosmo glass; Uncle Richard (Darrell Hammond) and Aunt Martha (Kristen Wiig), who think that The Deer Hunter was hilarious, and who are hosts of a Nigerian foreign exchange student named Oleki (Kenan Thompson). When he came to live with them, Oleki—who has absorbed all of the Walken Family traits—could not speak any English. But now (he says) he [...] "talks like a normal teenaged American boy". The biggest laugh of the sketch occurs when Christopher expresses his sympathies for Scott's teenaged attitude: [...] "I <b>appreciate</b> <b>your</b> situation. For a Walken, adolescence is a difficult time. You feel like you're the only normal person in a school full of nutjobs." [...] Scott's response: [...] "Wow! It's like you're lookin' right into my noggin!" [...] (Will Forte also appears as a waiter {{at the beginning of the}} sketch, but does not do a Walken impression.) ...|$|E
