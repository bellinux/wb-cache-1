5|$|Oliver Cromwell, {{who led the}} {{uprising}} and declined invitations to be made king, became Lord Protector of England in 1657. It was marked by a ceremony in Westminster Hall, where he donned purple robes, sat on the Coronation Chair, and was invested {{with many of the}} traditional symbols of sovereignty, except <b>a</b> <b>crown.</b> <b>A</b> <b>crown,</b> perhaps saved from the melting pot in 1649, was placed beside Cromwell at his lying in state in 1660.|$|E

5|$|After López de Salcedo {{had been}} {{installed}} as governor, the emissaries {{that had been}} sent by Pedrarias arrived, expecting to find Saavedra. Although they did not dare to present Pedrarias' demands to <b>a</b> <b>Crown</b> representative, López de Salcedo had them imprisoned. When the Crown had appointed the new governor, it had not defined the limits of Honduras. Pedrarias {{had been replaced by}} <b>a</b> <b>Crown</b> representative in July 1526; this prompted López de Salcedo to claim jurisdiction over Nicaragua, based upon the actions of González Dávila and Hernán Cortés. He left a few men under the command of Francisco de Cisneros in Trujillo, and marched with 150 men to impose his authority over Nicaragua.|$|E

5000|$|Australia, for example, {{has been}} {{referred}} to as <b>a</b> <b>crowned</b> republic. The Australian Republic Advisory Committee, which was created in 1993 by Paul Keating, then Prime Minister, described the country as <b>a</b> <b>crowned</b> republic because they said it was [...] "a state in which sovereignty resides in its people, and in which all public offices, except that at the very apex of the system, are filled by persons deriving their authority directly or indirectly from the people" [...] so [...] "it may be appropriate to regard Australia as <b>a</b> <b>crowned</b> republic" ...|$|R

50|$|The {{crowned eagle}} {{is perhaps the}} only extant {{raptorial}} bird which has been believed to attack human children as prey. In one case, a 7-year-old boy, of a weight of approximately 20 kg, was ambushed by <b>a</b> <b>crowned</b> eagle, who gouged its talons through the boy's throat and chest. The attack was ended {{by a woman who}} came upon them and rescued the child by bludgeoning the eagle to death with a hoe. In another case, the skull of a human child was found in the nest of <b>a</b> <b>crowned</b> eagle pair. In yet another instance, when assisting in the investigation of the disappearance of a four-year-old girl, Simon Thomsett came to believe she was the victim of <b>a</b> <b>crowned</b> eagle after the severed arm of a child was found in a tall tree that was inaccessible to leopards and known to be used as <b>a</b> <b>crowned</b> eagle cache.|$|R
5|$|The Roman army {{awarded a}} variety of {{individual}} decorations (dona) for valour to its legionaries. Hasta pura was a miniature spear; phalerae were large medal-like bronze or silver discs worn on the cuirass; armillae were bracelets worn on the wrist; and torques were worn round the neck, or on the cuirass. The highest awards were the coronae ("crowns"), of which the most prestigious was the corona civica, <b>a</b> <b>crown</b> made of oak-leaves awarded for saving {{the life of a}} Roman citizen in battle. The most valuable award was the corona muralis, <b>a</b> <b>crown</b> made of gold awarded to the first man to scale an enemy rampart. This was awarded rarely, as such a man hardly ever survived.|$|E
5|$|The collar {{was made}} of gold, {{consisting}} of Tudor roses and harps attached with knots.

5|$|A similar {{system for}} the Church of England was {{approved}} in 1976. The traditions of Eastern Christian heraldry have less developed regulation. Eastern secular coats of arms often display a shield before a mantle topped with <b>a</b> <b>crown.</b> Eastern clergy often display coats of arms according to this style, replacing the crown with an appropriate hat drawn from liturgical use.|$|E
5|$|According to the Illuminated Chronicle, {{in order}} to secure Solomon's succession, his father {{arranged}} a meeting with Duke Béla at the royal manor in Tiszavárkony. The king proposed that his brother choose between <b>a</b> <b>crown</b> and a sword (which were the symbols of royal and ducal power, respectively), but had previously commanded his men to murder the duke if Béla picked the crown.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{model for}} the iconography of Saint Jovan Vladimir is an engraving in the 1690 edition of the Greek akolouthia. It is a work by Venetian engraver Isabella Piccini. She depicted the saint with a mustache and short beard, wearing a cloak and <b>a</b> <b>crown</b> inscribed with lilies, holding a cross in his right hand, and his severed head in his left hand. A portable icon in Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, dated around 1700, shows the saint mounted on horseback.|$|E

5|$|Howe {{worked to}} place the government-dominated Canadian National Railways (CNR) on a sound {{financial}} basis. He introduced legislation to form the CNR into <b>a</b> <b>crown</b> corporation. Although the opposition complained that Howe was becoming power mad, they had little quarrel with the proposed reorganization itself, and it was passed into law. In June 1936, Howe brought in legislation to establish another crown corporation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which passed into law with little debate or opposition.|$|E
5|$|In Greek mythology, Corona Borealis {{was linked}} to the legend of Theseus and the minotaur. It was {{generally}} considered to represent <b>a</b> <b>crown</b> given by Dionysus to Ariadne, the daughter of Minos of Crete, after she had been abandoned by the Athenian prince Theseus. When she wore the crown at her marriage to Dionysus, he placed it in the heavens to commemorate their wedding. An alternate version has the besotted Dionysus give the crown to Ariadne, who in turn gives it to Theseus after he arrives in Crete to kill the minotaur that the Cretans have demanded tribute from Athens to feed. The hero uses the crown's light to escape the labyrinth after disposing of the creature, and Dionysus later sets it in the heavens. The Latin author Hyginus linked it to <b>a</b> <b>crown</b> or wreath worn by Bacchus (Dionysus) to disguise his appearance when first approaching Mount Olympus and revealing himself to the gods, having been previously hidden as yet another child of Jupiter's trysts with a mortal, in this case Semele. Corona Borealis was one of the 48 constellations mentioned in the Almagest of classical astronomer Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|In some European Celtic or Germanic {{countries}} {{prior to}} the adoption of Christianity, the ruler upon his election was raised on a shield and, while standing upon it, was borne on the shoulders of several chief men of the nation (or tribe) in a procession around his assembled subjects. This was usually performed three times. Following this, the king was given a spear, and a diadem wrought of silk or linen (not to be confused with <b>a</b> <b>crown)</b> was bound around his forehead as a token of regal authority.|$|E
