40|$|American {{elections}} have increasingly become candidate-centered campaigns in which solitary aspirants for office bear {{the primary responsibility}} for generating their own money, issues, imagery, and support. Candidates present themselves through televised advertising appearing as social tribunes instead of representatives for political and governmental institutions. News media respond by depicting campaigns as ongoing battles among individual combatants and direct much of {{their attention to the}} question of who is winning and who is not. In an important book addressing these electoral features, Kaid and Johnston focus on the personal style candidates develop through television advertising. They claim a candidate 2 ̆ 7 s style is revealed initially through a general communication style, a pattern of behavior that is apparent, consistent, and recurring. Videostyle, composed of verbal, nonverbal, and film/video production techniques, is their term for this pattern. The writers draw their conclusions from 1, 204 televised ads, obtained from the Political Commercial Archive in the University of Oklahoma 2 ̆ 7 s Political Communication Center, employed by the nominees of the two major parties in the presidential elections of 1952 through 1996. They do not review the ads of unsuccessful candidates for nominations or standard-bearers of minor parties. The exhaustive nature of their work, however, suggests these additional ads would provide few, if any, new insights. Kaid and Johnston offer results that frequently challenge conventional wisdom. They find, for example, that ads focus more on issues than images and tend to be positive toward candidates. The conventional opposite notion, they believe, derives from news media interest in images and negative messages. Their work supports conventional wisdom in other instances, showing, for example, that most ads last for less than one minute. In addition, they contrast videostyle components and methods of proof (logical, ethical, emotional) between incumbents and non-incumbents, Democrats and Republicans, winners and losers, as well as the unique styles of individual candidates. Other chapters look at negative <b>advertising,</b> communication <b>ethics,</b> and videostyles in other nations. The writers of this well-researched, easy to read book present extensive data to support their conclusions about one of the more significant aspects of contemporary American political life. Scholars and practitioners of political communication can gain valuable insights into the workings of mediated information, particularly when generated by the candidates themselves, in a time when most voters have few other sources of information upon which to base their choices...|$|R

Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Margaret Duffy. Vita. Understanding the complexity of <b>advertising</b> <b>ethics</b> mandates an organizational approach to empirical research. Organizational culture affords attention to not only the advertising practitioner's perspectives of ethics, {{but also to the}} organizational context in that ethical decision-making takes place. This ethnography examines the relationship between organizational culture and <b>advertising</b> <b>ethics</b> at an advertising agency from the theoretical perspective of Giddens' structuration. Forty-five days of fieldwork and one-on-one interviews with 45 agency practitioners examined shared perceptions and divided views of organizational values, goals, challenges, and aspects of leadership; as well as perceptions of ethical problems in advertising. Members' ethical perceptions fell along a continuum from moral myopia to acute ethical awareness. Organizational values enabling ethical awareness and decision-making include integrity and respect for others. Also, the hands-on work characteristic of leaders sets an ethical example for others. A founder of the agency suggested ethics was not an intention for starting the agency. Furthermore, the agency does not espouse explicit ethical values or code. Therefore, the perceptions categorizing moral myopia suggest ways in which ethical awareness is simultaneously constrained. The concept of amorality is presented as the organizational perspective for understanding, and as a constraint upon, ethical intentions for an agency.

Individual dentists may feel the need to advertise in order to establish or grow a dental practice, but what effect does this have on the standing of the profession as a whole? As health care professionals are bound by a code of ethics, should dentists be allowed to advertise?Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the attitudes of Indian dentists to the issue of advertising. It also aims to explore whether advertising could have positive benefits (to increase the community&# 39;s awareness of dental health care, encourage better quality dental services, decrease unemployment in the industry, and help consumers choose a dentist), or, on the contrary, whether advertising could have a negative impact by undermining the reputation of the industry, in particular the definition of dentistry as a medical profession. Methods: Of 1500 eligible participants, 423 dentists (28. 2 %) participated in the study. The questionnaire, comprising 14 questions, was provided to the respondents. The data was collected and analyzed by applying the &ldquo;Chi-squared test&rdquo; of association and the &ldquo;Z test&rdquo; of difference between two proportions at 5 % and 1 % levels of significance (ie, P = 0. 05 and P = 0. 01).

40|$|In Australia, {{consumer}} complaints about advertising are adjudicated by the Advertising Standards Board (ASB) against ‘prevailing community standards’. Despite having a central {{place within the}} existing regulatory framework, there is no evidence-based definition of this term and it is used inconsistently within ASB decisions. Thus, complaint determinations made by the ASB may not {{be representative of the}} views of the Australian public. Currently, the majority of complaints made against advertisements in Australia are dismissed by the ASB as they are not considered contrary to ‘prevailing community standards’, {{in the context of the}} current <b>Advertising</b> Code of <b>Ethics.</b> This suggests that there is a gap between the standards held by the community and those utilized by the ASB; a gap that needs to be addressed to ensure Australia has a more accurate, fair and community focus complaint determination process. AIM This project aimed to collect comprehensive data on the nature of community standards in relation to advertising – both in terms of what is deemed to be (un) acceptable and the underlying considerations (or viewpoints) on which these standards are determined. To achieve this, this project: developed a taxonomy of evidence-based standards on community views on the ethicality of various types of images and messages in advertising; investigated whether the community holds different standards towards advertising in a commercial compared to a social marketing context; and, finally, explored what other considerations the community take into account when determining the acceptability of advertising content. METHODOLOGY To more thoroughly investigate the concept of community standards for advertising, this project consisted of qualitative and quantitative research, based on Creswell and Plano Clark’s (2007) Taxonomy Development Model. During the first phase, a series of 20 focus groups were held to determine the range of issues which members of the community see as ethically problematic in advertising. Following a thematic analysis, the results were used to develop a taxonomy of ethical issues in advertising, as perceived by members of the Australian community. To quantify the results of Phase One, a community-based survey was conducted in Phase Two. RESULTS There were three major themes that emerged from this research: stereotypes, prejudice and language; violence and potentially harmful behaviours; and adverse effects of advertising on children. These themes were consistent across the qualitative and quantitative phases of this research. The most notable finding was that the opinions held by the community in respect to these three themes were independent of gender, age, level of education, religious affiliation, being a parent, and previous lodgement of a complaint about advertising. The results also demonstrated that there was a difference in the standards the community held towards social marketing advertising and commercial advertising. Finally, it was clear that there were a number of thoughtful, reasoned considerations that these community members took into account when determining their opinion on (un) acceptable advertising; that is, responses were not merely a one-dimensional reaction to the image or message portrayed. DISCUSSION Australia’s current system of advertising self-regulation does not adequately address or represent the standards the community hold for acceptable advertising. Changes need to be made to the manner in which the system is regulated, including (but not restricted to) a more representative Code of Ethics that reflects current issues of concern held by the community and a complaints resolution process that takes into account the various considerations behind a complainant’s opinion. Until this occurs, advertising complaints will not be accurately or fairly adjudicated by the ASB against ‘prevailing community standards’.

40|$|It is the {{recognition}} of the advertising industry that ethics in advertising require an overall responsibility of all stakeholders of industry. There are a number of laws in many developed countries that clearly define rules and regulations in regards to placement, timing and content of the advertising.

40|$|As one of {{the most}} visible {{marketing}} tools, advertising is no new to social controversy and ethical concerns. Despite <b>advertising</b> <b>ethics</b> has been defined as the ultimate oxymoron (Beltramini 2003), the study of ethics of/in advertising is quite ancient and extensive. However, <b>advertising</b> <b>ethics</b> has been studied mainly in a moral-philosophical perspective and from a “macro” viewpoint. Few scholars have examined the ethical practice of advertising professionals (Drumwright & Murphy, 2004) or the specific topic of the advertising practice relating to gender representations. In spite of persistent criticisms of advertising’s treatment of gender (Kilbourne, 1999) and despite some studies about professionals’ ethical dilemmas (Drumwright & Murphy, 2004, 2009; Fraedrich, Ferrell, & Pride, 1989; Moon & Franke, 2000; Pratt & James, 1994), few authors have focused their attention on the production process behind the gendered messages (Tuncay Zayer & Coleman, 2014). In Italy, in particular, there is a rich literature on gender stereotypes in advertisements, a recent surge of attention among professionals about the bias in the media representations of women, but there is no study about the production processes or the perceptions of gendered images among professionals. Thus, the paper focused on the advertising practice as it relates to gender. In order to appreciate the commercial “culture of production” (du Gay, 1997), we studied the production processes that lead to particular gender representations {{and the manner in which}} advertising professionals make sense of ethical issues related to gender portrayals within their societal contexts. In particular, we tried to discover where the ideas for certain gender representations come from, who determine how and what gender-based advertising should be, which are the prevailing cultural norms and practices in the advertising gender representations, what are practitioners’ perceptions of how advertising gender portrayals impact male and female audiences, in what ways do ethics inform their creative and strategic choices regarding gender portrayals in advertising. We hypothesized that the professionals are actors in a broader institutional system and their beliefs and actions are shaped within the organizations to which they belong and the society where certain gender discourses prevail (Tuncay Zayer & Coleman 2014). Because the study’s aim is to understand practitioners’ thinking about the work of advertising in their own terms and to evaluate those thoughts relative to existing theories, a qualitative design was selected. Semistructured in-depth interviews with senior-level agency practitioners (at least 20 creative, planning, and account directors working in Italy) were used as the key field method. Respondents were selected using snowball sampling. First results provide evidence for the existence of such autonomous practitioner knowledge schemas. Advertising agency professionals know well the bias of the most common representations of gender in Italian advertising. They recognize the most frequent sex-stereotypes and are particularly critical towards them. In particular, the respondents believe that the gendered images are mainly caused by inexperienced operators or customers. They appreciate the cases of innovative representation of gender identity and strongly believe in the need for professional ethics that protects a more equitable and respectful gender representation. Finally, they are aware of the impact on the public of stereotyped gender portrayals, but they do not believe in the need for more or stricter codes of conduct...|$|E

The spot coincided with a public campaign against street harassment and various organizations criticized advertising Lemon Soda and filed a complaint to the National Council of Self-Regulation and <b>Advertising</b> <b>Ethics</b> (CONAR), calling for sanctions against the company responsible.    En marzo de 2014, Michelle Bachelet e Isabel Allende asumieron los dos máximos cargos de poder político e institucional en Chile -presidenta de la República y presidenta del Senado, respectivamente-. Ese mismo mes, la presidenta anunció la creación del ministerio de la Mujer y la Equidad de Género. Paradójicamente, por esos días, la bebida gaseosa Limón Soda, lanzaba una campaña publicitaria que incluía piezas audiovisuales que mostraban a jóvenes en actitudes de acoso callejero, las que están penadas por la ley chilena (grababan con sus celulares sus escotes o sus piernas, por ejemplo).

Esas tres cuestiones están en la base de este trabajo, que pretende realizar una panorámica sobre las normas deontológicas publicitarias, analizando críticamente tanto sus aportaciones como sus lagunas o incumplimientos. Tras las conclusiones, ofrecemos un «Decálogo de Buenas Prácticas para la Utilización de la Imagen del Menor en la Publicidad». The growing {{presence of}} children in advertising not directed at them makes us to consider three issues that most directly affect the principle of protecting children in the media: 1) To what extent the <b>advertising</b> <b>ethics</b> effectively protect the principle of protecting children? 2) What sets ethical codes about the presence {{of children in}} advertising, especially in regard to his image in the commercials? 3) To what extent are met standard specifications listed above? These three issues are the basis of this work, which aims to conduct an overview of ethical standards in the field of advertising, critically analyzing both their contributions and their shortcomings or failures. Following the conclusions, we offer a «Ten Commandments of Good Practice for the Use of the Image of Child in Advertising»...|$|E
