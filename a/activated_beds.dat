40|$|Introduction: Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{are one of}} the most significant current environmental issues. Phenanthrene and naphthalene adsorption at <b>activated</b> carbon <b>beds</b> prevent the release of these compounds into the environment. The objective of this research was to compare the amounts of phenanthrene and naphthalene adsorption at <b>activated</b> carbon <b>beds</b> in the n-hexane solution.. Material and Method: This discontinuous experimental study was conducted in the laboratory scale batch and in the n-hexane solution containing phenanthrene and naphthalene. PH values were adjusted by adding hydrochloric acidand 1 N NaOH. The initial and residual phenanthrene and naphthalene concentrations were spectrophotometrically measured at 270 and 266 nm, respectively.. Results: Findings showed that the maximum adsorption of naphthalene was obtained at pH= 5 and contact time of 8 hours (7. 4 mg/gr). The maximum adsorption was reached at pH= 7 and contact time of 11 hours for phenanthrene (8. 34 mg/gr). Improvement in the adsorption capacity was happenedby the increases in contact time and initial phenanthrene and naphthalene concentrations. The adsorption kinetics of these two compounds followed pseudo-second-order and Freundlich isotherm model.. Conclusion: Freundlich isotherm model showed a strong association with PAHs adsorption process.
