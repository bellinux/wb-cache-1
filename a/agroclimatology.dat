In the dry tropics variation in the timing and amount of precipitation are the key factors influencing agricultural production possibilities. The agricultural value of rainfall varies with the factors that influnce evapotranspiration. In determining the agricultural potentialities of any semi-arid area, a quantification of the rainfall, soil, and evapotranspiration is of importance. Appropriate quantification of the growing season and its characteristics could be of great help in crop planning. The objectives of <b>agroclimatology</b> research are: To understand rainfall variability for quantifying associated risks in crop production. To characterize crop response to prevailing moisture envionment; to assist in crop planning for increased and stabilized agricultural production. To develop a climate-driven production model to predict crop performance at different locations.

40|$|Climate {{has been}} of primary concern from the {{beginning}} of agricultural research. Early in the 20 th century, climatology and agronomy evolved separately, focusing primarily on production agriculture and crop adaptation. Concepts developed include thermal units and water use efficiency. The integrated discipline of <b>agroclimatology</b> developed in the mid- 20 th century. As theoretical understanding evolved, numerous papers related to <b>agroclimatology</b> were named Citation Classics. Spectral properties of plants and soils were identified that underpin today’s remote sensing technologies. Commercialization of instrumentation enhanced our ability to efficiently collect data using standardized methods. Private and public-sector partnerships advanced research capacity. Later in the 20 th century, research focus shifted toward integrating knowledge into crop growth and agronomic models. Remote sensing provided capacity to gain theoretical and practical understanding of regional scale processes. In the early 21 st century, recognition of earth as a system along with inter-related human systems is driving research and political agendas. There is a pressing need to change our data-rich to an information-rich environment. The emerging cyberinformatics field along with natural resource and agricultural system models allow us to apply climate information to assessments and decision support related to water supply, production, environmental management, and other issues. Solutions to today’s problems require interdisciplinary and multi-sectoral teams. While needs have never been greater, fewer universities maintain critical mass required to off er advance degrees in <b>agroclimatology.</b> It will be increasingly important that agrclimatology attract top students and provide training and practical experience in conducting integrated systems research, communications, and team skills...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to calculate the accumulated thermal time and estimate the phenological stages length of three soybean cultivars in two crop years, using agronomic models associated to meteorological variables. Two experiments were conducted in a field at the <b>Agroclimatology</b> Laboratory (LAGRO) of the Federal University of Santa Maria/UFSM, campus of Frederico Westphalen/RS, Brazil during the 2012 / 2013 and 2013 / 2014 crop years. A randomized block in a factorial scheme 6 x 3 with six spatial arrangements (45, crossed, 20, 20 x 40, 20 x 60 and 20 x 80 cm) and three cultivars with different cycles and growth habits (BMX Ativa RR/determinate, BMX Turbo RR/indeterminate and BMX Potência RR/indeterminate) with three replications were used for the experimental design. Sowing was held on 11 / 28 / 2012 and 12 / 02 / 2013. The assessed phenological stages were sowing-emergence; emergence – final vegetative; final vegetative – full bloom; full bloom – physiological maturity. The duration of each stage was related to meteorological parameters: maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, and thermal time.

40|$|Agricultural drought is {{the leading}} cause for crop failure {{throughout}} the world. In the USA, significant impacts of recent droughts on agricultural production indicate the continuing vulnerability of the country to drought. This paper presents a methodology for spatial representation of the agroclimatic component of agricultural drought vulnerability. This methodology was developed as a part of an integrated assessment of drought vulnerability. For the spatial analysis, the state of Nebraska was selected as a study area because of the considerable variation in climatology, soil characteristics, land use, and cropping patterns. The underlying approach assumes that the best spatial characterization of the state’s <b>agroclimatology</b> from the agricultural drought vulnerability perspective is the probability of seasonal crop moisture deficiency. Seasonal crop water-use thresholds for well-watered crops (e. g. corn, soybean, and sorghum) were estimated using the evapotranspiration (ET) mathematical model. For wheat and grass, ET values were estimated based on the relationship between ET, water-use efficiency, and crop yield. Historical grain yield data were analyzed to define an economically viable threshold for wheat. Seasonal ET thresholds determined for the crops were used to calculate area-weighted mean ET for the combination of crops in every county. The threshold values and long-term precipitation data were used for calculating statistical probabilities of seasonal crop moisture deficiency. Probability values were analyzed at 112 weather stations across Nebraska, spatially interpolated and classified using geographic information systems. The spatial pattern of probabilities of seasonal crop moisture deficiency reflected both seasonal precipitation across Nebraska and the distribution of crops and grasses...|$|E
40|$|Belgium has {{accumulated}} considerable experience in tropical agriculture over the years. This is {{the fruit of}} work carried out in research centres in its former African colonies and {{in other parts of}} the world where Belgian experts have been involved in agricultural development. To take advantage of this rich experience the Belgian Ministry of Education decided to establish, in 1970, the Centre for Applied Information on Tropical Agricultural Development, shouldered jointly by the Albert I Royal Library and by the Royal Museum of Central Africa and supported by the Fund for Fundamental and Collective Research. The Centre also benefits from scientific and technical assistance from CNDST (National Centre for Scientific and Technical Documentation). ClDAT's objectives are manifold. First and foremost, the centre focusses on the inventory and the preservation of scientific achievements of Belgian experts in the field of tropical agriculture so that less developed countries may benefit from this wide experience. Within this perspective ClDAT develops techniques for the comparative study of agrobioclimatic characteristics to facilitate the transfer of technologies, cropping techniques and plant species while evaluating the risks involved. CIDAT also advises individuals and organizations who wish to adopt this development approach. It attempts to promote the introduction of new varieties by acting as a link between national research centres, development agencies and gene banks. CIDAT publishes the results of the applied research undertaken. In Belgium, the centre serves as a focal point both for Belgian agronomists working abroad and for graduate students in agronomy preparing to work overseas. In order to meet these objectives, CIDAT has been set up as four independent panels working on the following topics: <b>agroclimatology,</b> soil science and management, ecology and plant introduction as well as data processing. Each panel is headed by an agronomist who has made his career overseas with an experience of at least ten consecutive years both in the field of research and applied agronomy. This type of organization facilitates individual contacts as inquiries emanate from related experience and relevant context. The inquiries received at the centre are steadily increasing and more than twenty-five percent are from abroad. They come from private companies (20 %), higher education (60 %) and governmental or international institutions (20 %) The centre mainly received inquiries on the following subjects, in order of importance: crop production, <b>agroclimatology</b> (CIDAT has a data bank of 58, 000 entries), documentation, economic analysis, soil science, physical geography, food supply, forestry technology, fish farming, animal husbandry, seed supply and plant ecology. As far as the inquiry service is concerned, CIDAT collaborates closely with SERDAT, the Documentation Service for Tropical Agriculture that belongs to the Royal Albert I Library. There are regular joint activities and exchanges between the two centres, in particular for the purchase of publications to rationalize expenditure. CIDAT publishes the results of the activities and research in a series of six editions: - 'Thesauri', a series mainly concerned with information processing (three publications) - 'Bulletin for research in comparative agrobioclimatology'(two publications) - 'Studies on tropical wood' (two publications) - 'Abstracts' (six publications) - 'World catalogue of climatic date' (nine publications) - 'Miscellaneous' (two publications) All these publications, as well as copies of miscellaneous reports and articles published in periodicals of other organizations, are available from: Patrimoine du Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale.

This document lists some of the main capabilities that have been recently developed, especially in the area of operational <b>agroclimatology,</b> for an efficient use of natural resources and a better management of climatic risks. Many countries, including the developing world, now benefit from well-trained staff in the use of climate data, physical and biological information and knowledge to reduce negative climate impacts. A significant volume of data and knowledge about climate–agriculture relationships is now available and used by students, scientists, technicians, agronomists, decision-makers and farmers alike, particularly in the areas of climate characterization, land suitability and agroecological zoning, seasonal climate forecasts, drought early warning systems and operational crop forecasting systems. Climate variability has been extensively modelled, capturing important features of the climate through applied statistical procedures, agroclimatic indices derived from raw climatic data and from remote sensing. Predictions of climate at seasonal to interannual timescales are helping decision-makers in the agricultural sector to deal more effectively with the effects of climate variability. Land suitability and agroclimatic zoning have been used in many countries for agricultural planning, thanks to the availability of new and comprehensive methodologies; developments in climate, soil and remote sensing data collection and analysis; and improved applications in geographic information systems (GIS). Drought early warning systems are available worldwide at both national and international levels. These systems are helping decision-makers and farmers to take appropriate decisions to adapt to short-term climatic risks. Also, operational crop forecasting systems are now becoming available at the regional and national levels. In some developed countries, several efficient and well tested tools are now available for optimizing on-farm decisions based on the combination of crop simulation models and seasonal forecasts. However, in developing countries few tools have been developed to efficiently manage crops at the farm level to cope with climate variability and climate risks. Climate change impacts on agriculture and food security have been assessed in international studies using specific and efficient methodologies and tools. Adaptation to climate change and variability can also be facilitated through effective planning and implementation of strategies at the political level. The role of technological progress, risk transfer mechanisms and financial instruments and their easy accessibility to rural people are critical elements of climate risk management...|$|E
40|$|The {{macadamia}} nut is a high-value product {{for which there}} is considerable demand: world production currently represents less than one half of a percent of world edible tree nut production. Despite its earlier lack of success in Fiji, the considerable export potential of the crop, particularly {{in the context of the}} growing tourist trade, resulted in the decision to re-assess the potential of the crop in Fiji. These projects covered a short preliminary assessment mission in July and August 1989, and a more detailed examination, over one year, from December 1989, of the possible future development of macadamia in FijiA macadamia production expert, supported by consultants in macadamia genetic improvement and breeding, horticulture and bioclimatology, and farming systems, reviewed the various factors governing the crop's potential, particularly crop physiology, <b>agroclimatology,</b> and the adaptability of various genotypes. Also, training activities were undertaken, including a workshop and specialist training for staff of the Ministry of Primary Industries and Cooperatives. A study tour to Australia and Hawaii allowed two middle-level professional officers to gain experience of large-scale macadamia productionAs a result of the assessment conducted, it was concluded that macadamia deserves to be systematically evaluated as a potential crop in certain, selected areas where factors such as wind risk and temperature should not be limiting. In this regard, a longer- term evaluation of the improved important varieties, a careful selection of sites, and a further study of the farming systems involved, was neededIt was therefore recommended that the Government proceed with a programme for the introduction of a wide range of improved macadamia varieties. These should be observed, and evaluated, in various climatological environments in Fiji, to verify the agronomic and economic viability of the crop. At the same time, a programme investigating other tropical and subtropical fruit crops should be undertaken, with the aim of identifying income-generating opportunitiesThe project therefore prepared a follow-up project proposal for fruit and nut research and development. This project, entitled `Fruit and Nut Development', was submitted to UNDP in Fiji, and it was recommended that the Government give high priority to its early implementation, under the Country Programme. In the course of this project, training should be arranged for national scientists, so as to put the Ministry of Primary Industries and Cooperatives in a position to carry this programme to completio...|$|E
