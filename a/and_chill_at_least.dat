40|$|Metabolic {{profiling}} {{represents a}} key element for herd health investigations in dairy herds. Though, the detection and prevention of subclinical metabolic diseases has the main priority. Subclinical ketosis (SCK) {{is one of the}} most frequent and economic important metabolic diseases in the transition period. SCK is associated with increased risk for clinical diseases, impaired reproductive performance and reduced productivity. Metabolic profiling with nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and β- hydroxybutyrate (BHB) has become the mainstay in monitoring dairy herds for SCK. Therefore, random samples are used. Metabolic profile results can be interpreted as either individual mean values of the subgroup sampled or as the proportion of animals above or below a certain cutpoint within the subsample. Both procedures require the analysis of all individual samples. Although the use of metabolic profiling has been widely advocated, their acceptance has been limited as a result of high cost. Pooling samples provides an alternative to reduce laboratory costs. For the efficiency and the success of the pooled sample procedure the adequate sampling, sample handling, sample size and the quality of the reference criteria are most meaningful. However, scientific evidence is missing for accepting the pooled sample procedure. Therefore the objectives of the study were to investigate the effects of different preanalytical procedures and to describe the diurnal and lactational variation of NEFA and BHB for validating the diagnostic potential of a pooled sample metabolic profile. For describing the effects of different preanalytical procedures six experiments were performed to investigate the effect of freeze-thaw, storage temperature and time of serum and whole blood, anticoagulant, blood collection side on the concentrations of NEFA and BHB, respectively. Fortysix pluriparous dairy cows were sampled to describe the dynamics of NEFA and BHB in the transition period. Additionally, the diurnal variation of NEFA and BHB was investigated in ten pluriparous cows in the last week antepartum and the first week postpartum, respectively. Recommendations based on the results of these experiments are: Blood samples should be either centrifugated or kept chilled for improving the storage stability. Centrifugation of blood samples is more important than storage temperature for conservation. Unchilled whole blood samples remain stable for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 12 hours <b>and</b> <b>chilled</b> samples for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 24 hours. Freezing serum samples can be used for long-term conservation. Blood sampling from the V. epigastrica cranialis superficialis should be avoided. NEFA and BHB contain a pronounced diurnal and lactational variation. NEFA reached their peak just before the fresh feed was delivered. After four to eight hours the concentrations decreased to the lowest level. Disregarding the diurnal variation in the postpartum period could be a failure source for misinterpretation of metabolic profiles. Based on lactation dynamics of NEFA, there was a gradual increase in the last week antepartum followed by an exponential increase at the time of parturition. Thereafter, small changes were observed in the first week postpartum. In contrast, BHB reached its peak four to eight hours after fresh feed was delivered. The diurnal variation was not of clinical relevance. Based on lactation dynamics of BHB, average BHB concentration did not change antepartum. At the time of parturition BHB decreased to the lowest level and increased continuously until the end of the experiment. However, there were strong individual differences in the shape of the diurnal and lactational variation for NEFA and BHB, respectively. For evaluating the pooled serum samples 278 metabolic profiles were performed. In each herd a maximum of ten pluriparous cows was sampled. In 110 herds a sample size of n = 10 was reached. The animals sampled were clinically healthy and in the first week postpartum. A pooled sample was build by mixing aliquot volumes of the individual sera of each sample. NEFA and BHB concentrations were measured in individual and pooled serum samples. Regarding the 2298 individual animals, the prevalence of SCK (BHB ≥ 1, 4 mmol/l) was 15. 8 %. Linear regression analysis and Bland-Altman method comparison revealed a high agreement between the pool value and the arithmetic mean of the sample. There was highly significant correlation between the two methods for NEFA (r = 0, 98; p < 0, 001) and BHB (r = 0, 98; p < 0, 001), respectively. The limits of agreement were - 0, 12 /+ 0, 13 mmol/l and - 0, 14 /+ 0, 15 mmol/l for NEFA and BHB, respectively. There is a strong relationship between the pool value and the number of abnormal animals in the sample. The pool value provides useful information about the deviation of diagnostic metabolites in an animal group with SCK. Different methods were used for generating reference criteria with high quality for a pooled sample procedure with NEFA and BHB. Based on the assumption that having a high proportion of cows with elevated NEFA and/ or BHBA concentrations in the fresh cow group increases the disease risk and the risk of impaired production the pool value of NEFA and BHBA from 10 randomly selected healthy animals in the first week postpartum could be regarded as a continuous measure of risk and provide useful information about the metabolic health of an animal group. The methods proposed in this study for generating reference criteria for pooled serum samples of NEFA and BHB can be used in the future for additional laboratory parameters for establishing the pooled sample metabolic profile as a reliable diagnostic approach for dairy herd health investigations...|$|R
