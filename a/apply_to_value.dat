40|$|The {{literature}} is increasingly focusing on how firms are improving their environmental performances and promoting green strategies to transform environmental constraints into new drivers of competitive advantage. This paper {{contributes to the}} literature by expanding knowledge about environmental management at the value chain level by exploring the concept of environmental upgrading and its implications in terms of economic upgrading and greening of industries. Leveraging on the global value chain and environmental managerial literature, the paper develops an integrated theoretical framework to analyse environmental upgrading trajectories and their implications in terms of firms' green strategies based on case studies in the Italian home-furnishing industry. Empirical evidence suggests that firms develop green strategies to reduce environmental impacts while achieving economic benefits and competitiveness, which may be internal to the firm but also <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>value</b> chains, with different implications in terms of bargaining power and value appropriation.

40|$|Within social {{learning}} theory, positive alcohol expectancies represent motivation {{to drink and}} negative expectancies, motivation to restrain. It is also recognized that a subjective evaluation of expectancies ought to moderate their impact, although the evidence for this in social drinkers is problematic. This paper addresses the speculation that the moderating effect will be more evident in clinical populations. This study shows that (i) both expectancy and value reliably, independently and equally predict clients' abstinence survivorship following discharge from a treatment programme (and that this is almost entirely confined to the negative rather than positive terms). When (ii) expectancy evaluations are processed against expectancy through multiplicative composites (i. e. expectancy x value), their predictive power is only equivalent to either expectancy or value on its own. However (iii) when the multiplicative composite is assessed following the statistical guidelines advocated by Evans (1991) (i. e. within the same model as its constituents, expectancy and value) the increase in outcome variance explained by its inclusion is negligible and casts doubt upon its use in alcohol research. This {{does not appear to}} <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>value,</b> however, and its possible role in treatment is discussed...|$|E

The simultaneous estimation of all production and functional traits is still demanding. Different meta-models are used to overcome several constraints. The {{aim of this study}} was to conduct an approximate multivariate two-step procedure <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> de-regressed breeding <b>values</b> and yield deviations of five fertility traits of Austrian Pinzgau cattle and to compare results with routinely estimated breeding values. The approximate two-step procedure <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> de-regressed breeding <b>values</b> performed better than the procedure <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> yield deviations. Spearman rank correlations for all animals, sires and cows were between 0. 996 and 0. 999 for the procedure <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> de-regressed breeding <b>values</b> and between 0. 866 and 0. 995 for the procedure <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> yield deviations.
