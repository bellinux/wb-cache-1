40|$|In this {{bachelor}} thesis, a nonlinear {{mathematical model}} simulation and linear controller {{design for the}} U 1 -H 1 helicopter was achieved. This thesis {{is divided into two}} parts. In the first part, the nonlinear dynamic model is developed using the Matrix Laboratory Software and Heli-Dyn R Software, which is a modeling and simulation tool for rotorcraft developed by Dr. Ilkay Yavrucuk at Middle East Technical University. The non-linear model consists in a contribution of main rotor, tail rotor, fuselage, gravitational model, horizontal and vertical tail rotor. The U 1 -H 1 main rotor non-linear mathematical model was build by use of blade element momentum theory, inflow dynamics and flapping dynamics. The total forces and moments are used in 6 degrees of freedom equations of motion model and helicopter states are obtained for hover conditions and forward flight. Trim and linearization process was done by Heli-Dyn R Software. The second part consists in a stability augmentation systems (SAS) followed by a set of automatic flight control systems (AFCS) designed by use of PID controllers. The AFCS main objective is to ease the pilot by decreasing the workload. The stability augmentation systems was designed by use of optimal control, especially Linear Quadratic Tracking Controller (LQT) and Linear Quadratic Regulator Controller (LQR). The automatic flight control systems implemented are heading hold, attitude, hold <b>altitude</b> <b>acquire</b> and hold mode for hover condition and heading hold, attitude hold, <b>altitude</b> <b>acquire</b> and hold mode and airspeed hold for forward flight condition. Furthermore, in order to check the robustness of the controllers and directory modes, disturbances were added to the model. The nonlinear model in trim mode simulations shown that the U 1 -H 1 has achieved hovering conditions and forward flight successfully. Furthermore, the controllers and directory modes shown a successful dynamic behavior towards perturbations...|$|R

40|$|High {{altitude}} platform (HAP) drones {{can provide}} broadband wireless connectivity to ground users {{in rural areas}} by establishing line-of-sight (LoS) links and exploiting effective beamforming techniques. However, at high <b>altitudes,</b> <b>acquiring</b> the channel state information (CSI) for HAPs, which is a key component to perform beamforming, is challenging. In this paper, by exploiting an interference alignment (IA) technique, a novel method for achieving the maximum sum-rate in HAP-based communications without CSI is proposed. In particular, to realize IA, a multiple-antenna tethered balloon {{is used as a}} relay between multiple HAP drones and ground stations (GSs). Here, a multiple-input multiple-output X network system is considered. The capacity of the considered M*N X network with a tethered balloon relay is derived in closed-form. Simulation results corroborate the theoretical findings and show that the proposed approach yields the maximum sum-rate in multiple HAPs-GSs communications in absence of CSI. The results also show the existence of an optimal balloon's altitude for which the sum-rate is maximized. Comment: Accepted in IEEE Communications Letter...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} number of articles stressing the advantage of applying remote sensing products of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) for rapidly enhancing the volume of geological data in Amazonian areas, where forest cover is dense and high, clouds are abundant and accessibility is limited. The majority of these studies has emphasized geomorphology as a tool for both discussing tectonic reactivations during the Cenozoic and reconstructing Quaternary paleolandscapes. This work applies Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) for delineating past morphological features under dense rainforest in an Amazonian lowland area. Previous use of this tool in southwestern Marajó Island (northern Brazil) helped to delineate, with exceptional precision, a paleochannel network hidden under the rainforest, which would be barely detected with other available remote sensing products. Fieldwork revealed that these paleochannels are related to palimpsest drainage systems developed mostly during the last 40, 000 14 C yr B. P. Measured <b>altitudes</b> <b>acquired</b> during topographic surveys attested that paleochannel areas are slightly higher than adjacent floodplains. This fact determined the successful application of SRTM-DEM for mapping paleochannels in Marajó Island. Integration of SRTM data with sedimentological information collected during fieldwork suggests paleoflows derived from continental areas located to south of the study area. This paleodrainage was active when the island was still connected to mainland. With island detachment due to reactivation of tectonic faults, the channels became abandoned and were progressively forested. The results obtained in the present study indicate that SRTM-DEM has high potential for unraveling similar morphological features from many other Amazonian areas with low topography and a dense forest cover.

The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the accuracy of the photogrammetric results based on novel method of multi-rotor UAV images as well as to analyze the slope error distribution that are obtained from the UAV images. This study only concentrates on multi-rotor UAV which also known as Hexacopter. An operator can control the speed of multi-rotor UAV during flight mission. Several ground control points and checkpoints were established using Real Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK- GPS) at the slope area. Ground control points were used in exterior orientation during image processing in sequence to transform image coordinates into local coordinate system. Checkpoints were established at the slope area for accuracy assessment. A digital camera, Sony NEX- 5 N was used for image acquisition of slope area from UAV platforms. The digital camera was mounted vertically at the bottom of UAV and captured the images at an <b>altitude.</b> All <b>acquired</b> images went through photogrammetric processing including interior orientation, exterior orientation and bundle adjustment using photogrammetric software. Photogrammetric results such as digital elevation model, and digital orthophoto including slope map were assessed. UAV is able to acquire data within short period of time with low budget compared to the previous methods such as satellite images and airborne laser scanner. Analysis on slope analysis and error distribution analysis are discussed in this paper to determine the quality of slope map in the area of interest.

He is notified that the aircraft will be shot down if it flies over a populated area and must drop the toxin over water within seven minutes. He is told that the toxin is in cargo box A45114 but only hears [...] "A45..." [...] before Elliot switches off the VOR. Martin opens the spoilers to slow the 747 to make it descend to 10,000 ft (3,000 m) to open the cargo door without getting sucked out by the decompression and to get a signal for his cellphone. After reaching his intended <b>altitudes</b> and <b>acquiring</b> a signal, he retracts the spoilers and opens the cargo door. He finds the toxin in cargo box A45114. Elliot comes down and tries to shoot at the duo but can't get a clear shot as the bins are preventing the door from opening completely, expending all of his ammunition in the process. The ground controllers order the aircraft shot down by a missile from the USS Bremerton. Elliot activates the detonator to blow up the toxin but Martin and Jessica manage to drop the toxin out the plane before it detonates over water. They notify Seattle that the toxin has been dropped and the missile from the Bremerton is redirected away from the 747-200 and self-destructed.|$|R
40|$|Calculating a spacecraft's precise {{location}} at high orbital altitudes- 22, 000 miles (35, 800 km) and beyond-is {{an important and}} challenging problem. New and exciting opportunities become possible if satellites are able to autonomously determine their own orbits. First, the repetitive task of periodically collecting range measurements from terrestrial antennas to high altitude spacecraft becomes less important-this lessens competition for control facilities and saves money by reducing operational costs. Also, autonomous navigation at high orbital altitudes introduces the possibility of autonomous station keeping. For example, if a geostationary satellite begins to drift outside of its designated slot it can make orbit adjustments without requiring commands from the ground. Finally, precise onboard orbit determination {{opens the door to}} satellites flying in formation-an emerging concept for many scientific space applications. The realization of these benefits is not a trivial task. While the navigation signals broadcast by GPS satellites are well suited for orbit and attitude determination at lower <b>altitudes,</b> <b>acquiring</b> and using these signals at geostationary (GEO) and highly elliptical orbits is much more difficult. The light blue trace describes the GPS orbit at approximately 12, 550 miles (20, 200 km) altitude. GPS satellites were designed to provide navigation signals to terrestrial users-consequently the antenna array points directly toward the earth. GEO and HE 0 orbits, however, are well above the operational GPS constellation, making signal reception at these altitudes more challenging. The nominal beamwidth of a Block II/IIA GPS satellite antenna array is approximately 42. 6 degrees. At GEO and HE 0 altitudes, most of these primary beam transmissions are blocked by the Earth, leaving only a narrow region of nominal signal visibility near opposing limbs of the earth. This region is highlighted in gray. If GPS receivers at GEO and HE 0 orbits were designed to use these higher power signals only, precise orbit determination would not be practical. Fortunately, the GPS satellite antenna array also produces side lobe signals at much lower power levels. NASA has designed and tested the Navigator, a new GPS receiver that can acquire and track these weaker signals, thereby dramatically increasing the signal visibility at these altitudes. While using much weaker signals is a fundamental requirement for a high orbital altitude GPS receiver, it is certainly not the only challenge. There are other unique characteristics of this application that must also be considered. For example, Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP) figures are much higher at GEO and HE 0 altitudes because visible GPS satellites are concentrated in a much smaller area with respect to the spacecraft antenna. These poor PDOP values contribute considerable error to the point solutions calculated by the spacecraft GPS receiver. Finally, spacecraft GPS receivers must be designed to withstand a variety of extreme environmental conditions. Variations in acceleration between launch and booster separation are extreme. Temperature gradients in the space environment are also severe. Furthermore, radiation effects are a major concern-spacecraft-borne GPS receivers must be designed with radiation-hardened electronics to guard against this phenomenon, otherwise they simply will not work. Perhaps most importantly, there are no opportunities to repair or modify any space-borne GPS receiver after it has been launched. Great care must be taken to ensure all performance characteristics have been analyzed prior to liftoff...|$|R
40|$|Low {{altitude}} {{aerial image}} sequences have {{the advantages of}} high overlap, multi viewing and very high ground resolution.

This paper mainly focuses on the photogrammetric processing of low <b>altitude</b> image sequences <b>acquired</b> by unmanned airship, which automatically flies according to the predefined flight routes under the controlment of autopilot system. The overlap and relative rotation parameters between two adjacent images are estimated by matching two images as a whole and then precisely determined by pyramid based image matching and relative orientation. The matched image points and ground control points are then used for aerial triangulation with collinearity equations. The aerial triangulated high resolution images can be used to obtain precise spatial information products, such as Digital Surface Model (DSM), Digital Ortho Map (DOM) large scale Digital Linear Graphic (DLG) and three-dimensional (3 D) city model. Experimental results show that the developed remote sensing system is qualified for high overlap and high resolution stereo imagery acquisition. Moreover, the proposed approaches are effective for photogrammetric processing of low altitude image sequences, and have well potentials in large scale topographic mapping and precise 3 D reconstruction areas. 1...|$|R
40|$|The present {{work has}} {{explored}} {{for the first}} time acclimation of upper versus lower canopy leaves along an altitudinal gradient. We tested the hypothesis that restrictive climatic conditions associated with high altitudes reduce within-canopy variations of leaf traits. The investigated beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest is located on the southern slope of the Hrubý Jeseník Mountains (Czech Republic). All measurements were taken on leaves from upper and lower parts of the canopy of mature trees (> 85 years old) growing at low (400  m above sea level, a. s. l.), middle (720  m a. s. l.) and high (1100  m a. s. l.) altitudes. Compared with trees at higher altitudes, those growing at low altitudes had lower stomatal conductance, slightly lower CO 2 assimilation rate (Amax) and leaf mass per area (LMA), and higher photochemical reflectance index, water-use efficiency and Rubisco content. Given similar stand densities at all altitudes, the different growth conditions result in a more open canopy and higher penetration of light into lower canopy with increasing altitude. Even though strong vertical gradients in light intensity occurred across the canopy at all altitudes, lower canopy leaves at high <b>altitudes</b> tended to <b>acquire</b> the same morphological, biochemical and physiological traits as did upper leaves. While elevation had no significant effect on nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) contents per unit leaf area, LMA, or total content of chlorophylls and epidermal flavonoids in upper leaves, these increased significantly in lower leaves at higher altitudes. The increases in N content of lower leaves were coupled with similar changes in Amax. Moreover, a high N content coincided with high Rubisco concentrations in lower but not in upper canopy leaves. Our results show that the limiting role of light in lower parts of the canopy is reduced at high altitudes. A great capacity of trees to adjust the entire canopy is thus demonstrated...|$|R

Observations <b>acquired</b> in the period June 2006 to July 2008 were used to derive average temperature fields {{as a function of}} latitude, subsolar longitude (i. e., local time, LT), and pressure. Coverage presented here is limited to the nighttime because of the adverse effects of daytime non-LTE emission on the retrieval procedure and to southernmost latitudes because of the orientation of the Venus-Express orbit. Maps of air temperature variability are also presented as the standard deviation of the population included in each averaging bin. At the 100 mbar level (about 65 km above the reference surface), temperatures tend to decrease from the evening to the morning side despite a local maximum observed around 20 - 21 LT. The cold collar is evident around 65 S, with a minimum temperature at 3 LT. Moving to higher altitudes, local time trends become less evident at 12. 6 mbar (about 75 km) where the temperature monotonically increases from middle latitudes to the southern pole. Nonetheless, at this pressure level, two weaker local time temperature minima are observed at 23 LT and 2 LT equatorward of 60 S. Local time trends in temperature reverse about 85 km, where the morning side is the warmer. The variability at the 100 mbar level is maximum around 80 S and stronger toward the morning side. Moving to higher altitudes, the morning side always shows the stronger variability. Southward of 60 S, standard deviation presents minimum values around 12. 6 mbar for all the local times. © 2010 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R

By synthetically fitting the measured NO gamma bands, intensities are derived {{as a function of}} altitude and latitude. We find that the NO concentrations inferred from the ATLAS 1 measurements are higher than predicted by our thermospheric airglow model and tend to lie to the high side of a number of earlier measurements. By comparison with synthetic spectral fits, the shape of the NO gamma bands is used to derive temperature as a function of altitude. Using the simultaneous spectral and spatial imaging capability of the instrument, we present the first simultaneously <b>acquired</b> <b>altitude</b> images of NO gamma band temperature and intensity in the thermosphere. The lower thermospheric temperature images show structure as a function of altitude. The spatial imaging technique appears to be a viable means of obtaining temperatures in the middle and lower thermosphere, provided that good information is also obtained at the higher altitudes, as the contribution of the overlying, hotter NO is nonnegligible. By fitting both self-absorbed and nonabsorbed bands of the NO gamma system, we show that the self absorption effects are observable up to 200 km, although small above 150 km. The spectral resolution of the instrument (1. 6 A) allows separation of the N(+) (S- 5) doublet, and we show the contribution of this feature to the combination of the NO gamma (1, 0) band and the N(+) (S- 5) doublet as a function of altitude (less than 10 % below 200 km). Spectral images including the NO delta bands support previous findings that the fluorescence efficiency is much higher than that determined from laboratory measurements.

Now, the power of elevation lies altogether in the superior lightness of the gas in the balloon compared with the atmospheric air; and, at first sight, it does not appear probable that, as the balloon <b>acquires</b> <b>altitude,</b> and consequently arrives successively in atmospheric strata of densities rapidly diminishing--I say, it does not appear at all reasonable that, in this its progress upwards, the original velocity should be accelerated. On the other hand, I was not aware that, in any recorded ascension, a diminution was apparent in the absolute rate of ascent; although such should have been the case, if on account of nothing else, on account of the escape of gas through balloons ill-constructed, and varnished with no better material than the ordinary varnish. It seemed, therefore, that the effect of such escape was only sufficient to counterbalance the effect of some accelerating power. I now considered that, provided in my passage I found the medium I had imagined, and provided that it should prove to be actually and essentially what we denominate atmospheric air, it could make comparatively little difference at what extreme state of rarefaction I should discover it--that is to say, in regard to my power of ascending--for the gas in the balloon would not only be itself subject to rarefaction partially similar (in proportion to the occurrence of which, I could suffer an escape of so much as would be requisite to prevent explosion), but, being what it was, would, at all events, continue specifically lighter than any compound whatever of mere nitrogen and oxygen. In the meantime, the force of gravitation would be constantly diminishing, in proportion to the squares of the distances, and thus, with a velocity prodigiously accelerating, I should at length arrive in those distant regions where the force of the earth's attraction would be superseded by that of the moon. In accordance with these ideas, I did not think it worth while to encumber myself with more provisions than would be sufficient for a period of forty days.|$|R
40|$|A new {{interpretation}} of the tectonic evolution of {{the southern end of}} Monte Altissimo syncline is given in this study on the basis of new information acquired through traditional geo-structural survey and photo-{{interpretation of}} data derived from airborne lidar and optical proximal sensing. The high spatial resolution and the geometric accuracy of the data {{led to the creation of}} digital geo-referenced products and, through the creation of 3 D models with decimeter accuracy, the digitization of new morpho-structural elements. The study area is known in the geology of Apuan Alps because is studied since late nineteenth century by several authors among which Zaccagna (1932), Giglia (1967), and Meccheri et al. (2007). The interest in this zone is also increased by the presence of precious marbles cultivated by the Henraux company since 1821. The Monte Altissimo syncline has an approximately North-South trend for about ten kilometres in the Apuan Alps tectonic window (Northern Apennines). In the area of interest, the syncline is characterized by a core consisting of the Marbles Formation (Hettangian). The syncline flanks consist of carbonate formations with aged between Noricum and Hettangian (Megalodont Marbles, Seravezza Breccias and Grezzoni dolomites), that overlay the Hercynian basement. The tectonic evolution of the Apuan metamorphic complex is polyphasic, characterized by ductile and fragile deformation, and connected with the tertiary evolution of the orogenic Apennine wedge. In the area the following elements are particularly evident: i) the deformation geometries in low metamorphic state (green schists facies), produced by the compressional tectonic regime, which led to the structuring of the Monte Altissimo large isoclinal syncline with an East vergency; ii) the effects of the retro-deformation, created during ductile regime and low grade metamorphism, probably contemporary to the final stages of the orogenic wedge building, which develops a kilometric synform/antiform structure with a West vergency; iii) a subsequent deformative phase characterized by significant shear zones and low angle normal faults connected to the left and right transfer systems which overlaps the previous fold systems.

Because of such association, much effort is being made to merge the information from HEDs as well as Vestoids - with that from Vesta to characterize the lithologic diversity of the surface of this asteroid and to infer clues regarding its thermal history. However, while the HEDs are a class of meteorites well studied in the laboratory, the only spectral data available for Vesta until now were telescopic observations which are limited in terms of observation conditions, spatial resolution and Signal to Noise Ratio. The Dawn spacecraft, orbiting around Vesta since July 2011, is performing detailed observations of this body and thus improving our knowledge of its properties. Dawn s scientific payload includes an imaging spectrometer, VIR-MS, sensitive to the VIS-NIR spectral range. VIR-MS began acquiring spectra during the approach phase started in May 2011 and will continue its observations through July 2012 when the spacecraft will depart Vesta to travel to Ceres. The VIR-MS spatial resolution depends upon the mission phase (approach, survey, high altitude, low <b>altitude).</b> However, spectra <b>acquired</b> by VIR-MS have already exceeded the spatial resolution of ground-based telescopic observations, with resolution in the approach phase ranging from 2. 5 up to 0. 8 km/pixel.
