40|$|Abstract Background <b>Acute</b> angle-closure <b>glaucoma</b> {{is a rare}} {{complication}} {{in patients}} receiving anti-depressant treatment. In the following case, we report the development of <b>acute</b> angle closure <b>glaucoma</b> in a patient who overdosed on Citalopram, an antidepressant, and discuss the possible etiological mechanisms for the condition. Case presentation We report a 54 year old, Caucasian lady, with depression and alcohol dependence syndrome, who developed <b>acute</b> angle-closure <b>glaucoma</b> after an overdose of Citalopram, along with alcohol. She was treated with medications and had bilateral Yag laser iridotomies to correct the glaucoma and has made complete recovery. In this case, the underlying cause for glaucoma appears {{to be related to}} the ingestion of Citalopram. Conclusion The patho-physiological basis for <b>acute</b> angle closure <b>glaucoma</b> in relation to antidepressant medications remains unclear. The authors suggest Citalopram may have a direct action on the Iris or Ciliary body muscle through serotonergic or anti-cholinergic mechanisms or both. This case highlights the importance of the awareness of the underlying risks, which may predispose an individual to develop <b>acute</b> angle-closure <b>glaucoma,</b> and reminds the clinicians the significance of history taking and examination of the eye before and after starting anti-depressants.

50|$|Anterior ischemic optic {{neuropathy}} (AION) includes diseases {{that affect the}} optic nerve head and cause swelling of the optic disc. These diseases often cause sudden rapid visual loss in one eye. Inflammatory diseases of the blood vessels, like giant cell arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, Churg-Strauss syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and rheumatoid arthritis can cause arteritic AIONs (AAION). The vast majority of AIONs are nonarteritic AIONs (NAION). The most common acute {{optic neuropathy}} in patients over 50 years of age, NAION has an annual incidence of 2.3-10.2/100,000. NAION presents as a painless loss of vision, often when awakening, that occurs over hours to days. Most patients lose {{the lower half of}} their visual field (an inferior altitudinal loss), though superior altitudinal loss is also common. The pathophysiology of NAION is unknown, but it is related to poor circulation in the optic nerve head. NAION is often associated with diabetes mellitus, elevated intraocular pressure (<b>acute</b> <b>glaucoma,</b> eye surgery), high cholesterol, hypercoagulable states, a drop in blood pressure (bleeding, cardiac arrest, peri-operative esp. cardiac and spine procedures), and sleep apnea. Rarely, amiodarone, interferon-alpha, and erectile dysfunction drugs have been associated with this disease.|$|E
40|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>glaucoma</b> is an ocular {{emergency}} and sight -threatening disease {{which is caused}} by a sudden increase in intraocular ocular pressure (IOP) due to blockage of aqueous humor outflow. <b>Acute</b> <b>glaucoma</b> can result in permanent loss of visual acuity and visual field (VF). Prophylactic or therapeutic medicine is rare for <b>acute</b> <b>glaucoma.</b> In animal studies, a well-established model to investigate this acute IOP spike is by fluid infusion and adjustment of the fluid level to induce high IOP within a few seconds. However, there is no blockage of aqueous outflow and the increase in intraocular pressure is unrealistically rapid. To mimic the IOP profile in human <b>acute</b> <b>glaucoma</b> attack, we propose the use of an ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD), Healon 5 (AMO, Santa Ana, CA, USA) which is injected intracamerally to block aqueous outflow. The IOP is allowed to increase naturally inside the globe. We found that Healon 5 can induce an acute elevation in IOP with very similar characteristics to those observed in humans. For example, the IOP profile during the attack, changes in the anterior segment and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thinning are all consistent with findings in human acute angle closure glaucoma (AACG). We believed that our new model can more accurately reflect <b>acute</b> <b>glaucoma</b> than other animal models. Based on these findings we further tested the neuroprotective effect of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) on retinal neurons against an acute rise in IOP (attack) with the new model. L. barbarum is an herb that has been used in Chinese medicine for thousands of years. The fruit of this plant is believed to be good for the health of the eyes. In our study we found that oral administration of LBP preceding an <b>acute</b> <b>glaucoma</b> attack can preserve the visual function of the animals despite the loss of neurons in the retinal ganglion cell layer (RGCL). L. barbarum intake seems to inhibit secondary cell death and progression of the disease. In conclusion, we had successfully established a new <b>acute</b> <b>glaucoma</b> attack animal model by intracameral injection of Healon 5. This model more closely resembles the condition observed in human <b>acute</b> <b>glaucoma.</b> We also found that LBP has a prophylactic neuroprotective effect against an <b>acute</b> <b>glaucoma</b> attack in animals. It can protect the visual function and possibly inhibit secondary cell death. Oral consumption of LBP as a health supplement may provide extra benefit to people who are at high risk of developing <b>acute</b> <b>glaucoma,</b> in addition to the protective effects of LBP against other diseases. published_or_final_versionAnatomyMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
