5|$|The Old Court – New Court {{controversy}} was a 19th-century political {{controversy in}} the U.S. state of Kentucky in which the Kentucky General Assembly abolished the Kentucky Court of Appeals {{and replaced it with}} a new court. The justices of the old court refused to recognize the action as valid, and for a time, two separate courts operated <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> of last resort for the state.|$|E
5|$|West Pennard Court Barn (which is {{also known}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> Barn, West Bradley) is a late 14th or early 15th century tithe barn which was built for Glastonbury Abbey.

5|$|After Desha was elected, Relief legislators, {{who held}} {{majorities}} {{in both houses}} of the General Assembly, attempted to remove the offending judges from office. Failing to achieve the needed two-thirds majority, the legislature passed a reorganization act abolishing the Court of Appeals and replacing it with a new court. Desha appointed justices favoring relief. The original court continued to claim authority <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> of last resort in the state; during {{what became known as the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, both courts operated simultaneously, with both claiming legitimacy. It was a politically tumultuous time.|$|E
5|$|Another {{question}} in the case was whether the High Court, sitting <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction to hear the case. Hill argued {{that because of the}} structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the court could not hear the case. She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E
5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E
50|$|On July 2, 2003 <b>the</b> <b>court</b> {{was again}} restructured. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> was {{split into two}} {{separate}} <b>Courts,</b> with <b>the</b> Trial Division continued <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Federal <b>Court</b> and <b>the</b> Appeal Division continued <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Federal <b>Court</b> of Appeal.|$|R

5|$|Dreadnought was christened with {{a bottle}} of Australian wine by King Edward VII on 10 February 1906, after only four months on the ways. The bottle {{required}} multiple blows to shatter on a bow that later became famous. Signifying the ship's importance the launch had been planned to be a large elaborate festive event, however <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> was still in mourning for Queen Alexandra's father who had died twelve days before, she did not attend and a more sober event occurred.|$|E
5|$|Henry Sue, a voter from Queensland, {{disputed the}} {{election}} of Hill and filed a petition under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 in the High Court of Australia, sitting in its capacity <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Disputed Returns. Sue argued that on the date of Hill's nomination to the Senate {{she was still a}} citizen of the United Kingdom and thus, because of the operation of section 44 of the Australian Constitution, was ineligible to be elected to the Parliament of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Hunt {{and eight}} others were tried at York Assizes on 16 March 1820, charged with sedition. After a two-week trial, five {{defendants}} were found guilty. Hunt {{was sentenced to}} 30months in Ilchester Gaol; Bamford, Johnson, and Healey were given one year each, and Knight was jailed for two years on a subsequent charge. A civil case {{on behalf of a}} weaver wounded at Peterloo was brought against four members of the Manchester Yeomanry, Captain Birley, Captain Withington, Trumpeter Meagher, and Private Oliver, at Lancaster Assizes, on 4 April 1822. All were acquitted, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> ruled their actions had been justified to disperse an illegal gathering.|$|E

5|$|In Han government, {{the emperor}} was the supreme judge and lawgiver, the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the armed}} forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations; those who earned a 600-bushel salary-rank or higher. Theoretically, there were no limits to his power. However, state organs with competing interests and institutions such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> conference (tingyi 廷議)—where ministers were convened to reach majority consensus on an issue—pressured the emperor to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions. If the emperor rejected a court conference decision, he risked alienating his high ministers. Nevertheless, emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to historical sources, Poe {{was influenced by}} other writers. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge was a general influence, and scenes of Pym and Dirk Peters in a cave echo scenes in Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, which many reviewers noted at the time, including London publications such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> Gazette and the Torch. The ship of corpses recalls {{the legend of the}} Flying Dutchman, a ship which is cursed and unable to return home.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> did not explain this.|$|E

5|$|Like Pedra Branca, the Sultan of Johor {{held the}} {{original}} ancient title to Middle Rocks. As Singapore had not exercised any {{rights as a}} sovereign over Middle Rocks, the ICJ determined that Malaysia retained sovereignty over this maritime feature. As for South Ledge, the ICJ noted that it fell within the apparently overlapping territorial waters of mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> had not been mandated {{to draw the line}} of delimitation with respect to the territorial waters of Malaysia and Singapore in the area in question, it simply held that sovereignty over South Ledge belonged to the state which owned the territorial waters in which it is located.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rowan, who espoused the Relief position, {{was elected}} to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1822 {{representing}} Jefferson and Oldham counties. He immediately became the leader of the Relief faction in the House. When Relief partisans decided to appeal Williams and Lapsley to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which was at the time the court of last resort in the state, Rowan was chosen to argue the appeal before the court alongside George M. Bibb and Lieutenant Governor William T. Barry. Their efforts failed, however, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> found the measure unconstitutional, upholding the decisions of the lower courts.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma's {{judicial}} branch {{consists of}} the Oklahoma Supreme Court, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, and 77 District Courts that each serve one county. The Oklahoma judiciary also contains two independent courts: a Court of Impeachment and the Oklahoma Court on the Judiciary. Oklahoma has two courts of last resort: the state Supreme Court hears civil cases, and the state Court of Criminal Appeals hears criminal cases (this split system exists only in Oklahoma and neighboring Texas). Judges of those two courts, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Civil Appeals are appointed by the Governor upon {{the recommendation of the}} state Judicial Nominating Commission, and are subject to a non-partisan retention vote on a six-year rotating schedule.|$|E

5|$|Section 3(c) {{contains}} its own preclearance {{language and}} differs from Section 5 preclearance in several ways. Unlike Section 5 preclearance, which applies to a covered jurisdiction {{until such time}} as the jurisdiction may bail out of coverage under Section 4(a), bailed-in jurisdictions remain subject to preclearance for as long <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> orders. Moreover, the court may require the jurisdiction to preclear only particular types of voting changes. For example, the bail-in of New Mexico in 1984 applied for 10 years and required preclearance of only redistricting plans. This differs from Section 5 preclearance, which requires a covered jurisdiction to preclear all of its voting changes.|$|E
5|$|The Court of King's Bench (or Court of Queen's Bench {{during the}} reign of a female monarch), {{formally}} known <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> of the King Before the King Himself, was an English court of common law in the English legal system. Created in the late 12th to early 13th century from the curia regis, initially following the monarch on his travels, the King's Bench finally joined the Court of Common Pleas and Exchequer of Pleas in Westminster Hall in 1318, making its last travels in 1421.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} part of a large reform {{movement}} to prevent equitable courts such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Chancery from undermining their business. It was far cheaper and faster than the older equivalents used by the Chancery and Common Pleas, leading to a drop in their business and an increase in that of the King's Bench. As such, the Chancery issued injunctions in an ineffective attempt to prevent its use. The Bill was finally abolished by the Uniformity of Process Act 1832.|$|E
