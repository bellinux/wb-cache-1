STUDY DESIGN/METHODS Eighteen patients underwent a single treatment session using a variable pulse-width <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser.</b> Test sites were performed using a 10 -mm spot size and up to four pulse widths (3, 20, 40, 60 ms) with and without epidermal cooling. Full treatments were performed 3 weeks later using optimum test parameters. The patients were evaluated at 3 and 6 weeks. RESULTS Patients with darker lentigines had greater lesion clearance than those patients with lighter colored lentigines. Shorter pulse widths and treatment without cryogen cooling both, independently, lowered the fluence threshold for lentigo clearance.

40|$|Background and Objective Basal Cell Nevus {{syndrome}} (BCNS) {{is characterized}} by numerous basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). Multiple treatments with the pulsed dye laser (PDL) have been shown, in small studies, to be effective {{for the treatment of}} superficial and nodular BCCs. Like PDL, the <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> can be vessel-selective, but has the added advantage of deeper tissue penetration. We evaluated the utility of the <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> in reducing the tumor burden in BCNS with a single treatment. Study Design/Materials and Methods A case report and review of the literature are presented. A 45 -year-old man with BCNS and a history of radiation therapy presented with an extraordinarily high tumor burden (> 250 BCCs). As a compassionate measure to reduce the tumor burden, we investigated the utility of a single treatment of the long-pulsed 755 [*]nm <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> to several BCC lesions. The treated lesions were evaluated at 2 -month and 7 -month clinical follow-up. Histopathologic analysis of a treated lesion was performed at 7 -month clinical follow-up. Results At 2 -month, and 7 -month clinical follow-up, 15 of 18 treated lesions or about 83 % of the <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> treated lesions showed a complete clinical response and appeared as hypopigmented areas with scarring. Histopathologic analysis of a treated lesion at 7 -month clinical follow-up showed no evidence of residual tumor. Conclusions The long-pulsed <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> may be helpful in significantly reducing tumor burden in difficult to manage BCNS patients with a single treatment. This provides a facile and practical treatment alternative for the management of challenging cases of BCNS. The limitation {{of this study is that}} it is a single case observation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acquired {{bilateral}} nevus of Ota-like macules (ABNOM), or Hori's macules, is {{a common}} Asian condition that is characterized by bluish hyperpigmentation in the bilateral malar regions. Unlike nevus of Ota, ABNOM is an acquired condition that often develops after 20 {{years of age and}} involves both sides of the face, but there is no mucosal involvement. Recently Q-switched (QS) 1064 nm Nd:YAG lasers have been effective in clearing this condition. The effectiveness of QS <b>alexandrite</b> <b>lasers</b> has not yet been studied. OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively assess the efficacy and complications of QS <b>alexandrite</b> <b>lasers</b> in the treatment of ABNOM. METHODS: Thirty-two Chinese women with ABNOM ranging in age from 28 to 66 years were involved in the study. All underwent QS alexandrite laser treatment (755 nm, spot size 3 mm, 8 J/cm(2)). Topical hydroquinone and tretinoin cream were given to those with hyperpigmentation after the laser surgery. Clinical photographs were taken before and after laser surgery and assessed by two independent observers. The degree of clearing was scored and complications, including hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, scarring, and erythema, were assessed. RESULTS: The mean number of treatment sessions was 7 (range 2 - 11) and the mean treatment interval was 33 days. Both observers identified more than 80 % of the patients as having more than a 50 % degree of clearing, and complete clearance was seen in more than 28 % of patients. Although most patients had postlaser hyperpigmentation and were on depigmentary regimes, the hyperpigmentation was seen in only 12. 5 % of the patients during photographic evaluation. Hypopigmentation was seen in 50 % of patients and erythema in 41 %. CONCLUSION: QS alexandrite appears to be effective in the treatment of ABNOM. Postoperative pigmentary changes were frequent and the use of topical depigmentary agents was necessary to achieve a satisfactory result. Transient hypopigmentation risk was high, affecting up to 50 % of the patients.
