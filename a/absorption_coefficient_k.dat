40|$|SUMMARY. The {{spectral}} reflectivities of homogeneous and exsolved titanomagnetites of {{the same}} chemical composition were measured in air and in oil. The reflectivities of the two kinds of titano-magnetite are closely similar in the blue part of the spectrum, but become increasingly different when proceeding towards the red end. The refractive indices (n) and the <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> (<b>k)</b> were calculated from the reflectivity values. The n-values of the two kinds of titanomagnetite show a pattern of separation {{similar to that of}} the reflectivity values. Regarding possible differences between the k-values no reliable conclusions could be drawn. Some possible xplanations ofthe observed separa-tions are discussed. THE present paper forms the first part of an investigation of the relations between chemical composition and spectral reflectivity in the magnetite-ulv 6 spinel s ries. Reflectivity measurements have earlier been made on a homogeneous titanomagnetite (Cervelle, 1967), magnetites from different localities (Demirsoy, 1968), lunar ulv 6 spinel (Cameron, 197 o), and on homogeneous titanomagnetites of varying compositions (Pr 6 vot and Mergoil, 1973).

At the temperatures and densities of the venusian atmosphere, the absorption is due mainly to binary collisions of CO 2 molecules. Using a realistic anisotropic intermolecular potential and assuming the absorbing dipole to be due to the electrostatic induction and a quantum overlap, a series of molecular dynamics simulations were performed for the temperature range 200 to 800 K, and the roto-translational (RT) collision-induced absorption spectra at frequencies from 0 to 250 cm(exp - 1) were derived. The <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> in the submillimeter region, used in constituency retrieval studies, decreases more than 10 times in the temperature range 200 to 800 K.
