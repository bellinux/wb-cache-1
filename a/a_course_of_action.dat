The Environmental Protection Agency is the federal agency that determines if a particular site is hazardous, prepares <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> to reduce the hazard, and finds the parties responsible for the pollution. If a site is listed with the Superfund program, federal dollars are available for cleanup.|$|E
5|$|The two {{predecessor}} {{theories to}} two-level utilitarianism, act and rule utilitarianism, were beset by various objections. For example, rule utilitarianism {{was criticized for}} implying {{that in some cases}} an individual should pursue <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> that would obviously not maximise utility. Conversely, act utilitarianism was criticized for not allowing for a 'human element' in its calculations, i.e. it is sometimes too difficult (or impossible) for an ordinary person.|$|E
5|$|Various {{protocols}} {{have been}} drawn up detailing <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for scientists and governments after extraterrestrial contact. Post-detection protocols must address three issues: {{what to do in}} the first weeks after receiving a message from an extraterrestrial source; whether or not to send a reply; and analyzing the long-term consequences of the message received. No post-detection protocol, however, is binding under national or international law, and Dominik and Zarnecki consider the protocols likely to be ignored if contact occurs.|$|E

5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} such <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> as abandonment of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his {{evidence to the}} enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the sounding rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain {{the amount of water}} in the ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps, leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had, and was in danger of sinking.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to stave off the}} Civil War, Dixon participated in a {{convention}} of border states and a peace convention in Frankfort, Kentucky, both in 1861. Both conventions were unsuccessful. At the outset of the war, the Kentucky General Assembly elected six arbiters to recommend <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for the Commonwealth. Dixon represented the pro-Union position along with John J. Crittenden and Samuel S. Nicholas. Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin, John C. Breckinridge, and Richard Hawes represented the southern sympathizers. The arbiters met on May 11, 1861. After the pro-Union men defeated a proposal to call a sovereignty convention, the six arbiters recommended a position of neutrality, which the General Assembly adopted.|$|E
5|$|Johnston decided upon <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> that {{forfeited}} {{the initiative}} across {{most of his}} defensive line, tacitly admitting that the Confederate defensive strategy for Tennessee was a sham. On February 7, at a council of war held in the Covington Hotel at Bowling Green, he decided to abandon western Kentucky by withdrawing Beauregard from Columbus, evacuating Bowling Green, and moving his forces south of the Cumberland River at Nashville. Despite his misgivings about its defensibility, Johnston agreed to Beauregard's advice that he should reinforce Fort Donelson with another 12,000 men, knowing that a defeat there would mean the inevitable loss of Middle Tennessee and the vital manufacturing and arsenal city of Nashville.|$|E

5|$|Meth {{mouth is}} very {{difficult}} to treat unless the patient stops using methamphetamine; persistent drug use makes changes in hygiene or nutrition practices unlikely. Many drug users lack access to dental treatment, and few are willing to participate in such <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> often because of poverty. Those who are willing to seek dental treatment often resist discussing their drug use. Providing dental treatment to individuals who use methamphetamine can also be dangerous, because the potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems. There is also an increased risk of serious side effects if opioid medications are used in the patient's treatment.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November, Riel invited Anglophones {{to attend}} a {{convention}} alongside Métis representatives to discuss <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> and on 1 December he proposed to this convention a list of rights to be demanded {{as a condition of}} union. Much of the settlement came to accept the Métis point of view, but a passionately pro-Canadian minority began organizing in opposition. Loosely constituted as the Canadian Party, this group was led by John Christian Schultz, Charles Mair, Colonel John Stoughton Dennis, and a more reticent Major Charles Boulton. McDougall attempted to assert his authority by authorizing Dennis to raise a contingent of armed men, but the Anglophone settlers largely ignored this call to arms. Schultz, however, attracted approximately fifty recruits and fortified his house and store. Riel ordered Schultz's home surrounded, and the outnumbered Canadians soon surrendered and were imprisoned in Upper Fort Garry.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords Select Committee {{assigned}} {{to deal with}} the bill was chaired by Lord Cromer and sat during November and December 1908. After several sessions, the committee declared several important decisions. It reaffirmed that federation would benefit {{of the people of the}} Potteries, that a differential rating system for a fixed period was required, that asset valuation in each town should be abandoned, and that the committee reserved the right to decide <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> should the parties not be able to reach agreement. This last point was important because without it all disputes would have to be passed back either to the Local Government Board or the House of Commons. With prorogation of the current Parliament on the horizon, this would have led to delays that jeopardised the passage of the whole bill through Parliament during that parliamentary session.|$|E

5|$|During {{the spring}} and into the summer, Stanley began meeting with Senator Byrd, State Senator Gray, and others to strategize about <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Byrd was {{concerned}} that one or more local school districts might integrate, creating a domino effect {{that would lead to}} integration across the entire South. Preventing this from happening became the preeminent concern of Stanley, Byrd, and the others. Stanley called the Gray Commission back into session in late May 1956, but the group was unable to immediately come up with any new recommendations. Attorney General Almond publicly urged Stanley to call a special session of the legislature on May 31, but House Speaker Moore demanded to know what proposals Almond felt the legislature should pass before any special session was called. On June 4, the Gray Commission again reported to the governor that it {{had not been able to}} improve on its November proposals, but it, too, advised the governor to call a special session of the legislature. The following day, Governor Stanley announced he would call the legislature into special session in late August.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1960s, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} {{of the benefits of}} retaining the canal. The Inland Waterways Association produced a report, entitled The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal - Waterway with a Future, suggesting that the canal had the potential for development as a linear Country Park, and the County Planning Officer for Somerset County Council produced a second report, suggesting that funds should be made available for maintenance and restoration, which the County Council duly adopted. The Countryside Act 1968 provided a framework for such action, and a visit in 1971 to see the work being done on the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal as part of the creation of the Brecon Beacons National Park convinced the Council of the wisdom of such <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> By 1974, Higher and Lower Maunsel locks, which are listed buildings, had been refurbished by the British Waterways Board, with funding from the County Council. Funding for towpath maintenance and weed cutting was also provided.|$|E
5|$|Themistocles {{probably}} turned 30 in 494BC, which qualified him {{to become}} an archon, the highest of the magistracies in Athens. On {{the back of his}} popularity, he evidently decided to run for this office and was elected Archon Eponymous, the highest government office in the following year (493BC). Themistocles's archonship saw the beginnings of a major theme in his career; the advancement of Athenian sea-power. Under his guidance, the Athenians began the building of a new port at Piraeus, to replace the existing facilities at Phalerum. Although further away from Athens, Piraeus offered three natural harbours, and could be easily fortified. Since Athens was to become an essentially maritime power during the 5th centuryBC, Themistocles's policies were to have huge significance for the future of Athens, and indeed Greece. In advancing naval power, Themistocles was probably advocating <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> he thought essential for the long-term prospects of Athens. However, as Plutarch implies, since naval power relied on the mass mobilisation of the common citizens (thetes) as rowers, such a policy put more power into the hands of average Atheniansand thus into Themistocles's own hands.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} formal {{framework}} for diagnosing failures and predicting safe runs <b>of</b> <b>actions,</b> given incomplete {{information on the}} initial state of affair, i. e. on the initial database providing {{a description of the}} domain before any action has taken place. Two aspects of uncertainty are formalized by two different notions of probability: uncertainty in the initial database and uncertainty during the execution <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions.</b> We introduce also a third concept of probability, which is obtained by combining the two previous notions. We call this new concept expected probability: it accounts for the probability of a sentence on the hypothesis that the sequence <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> needed to make it true might have failed. This new probability can be used to predict what would happen after <b>a</b> given <b>course</b> <b>of</b> actions; it leads to the possibility <b>of</b> comparing <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> and verifying which one is more safe. On the other hand, after <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> has been executed, and failures might have occurred, we give a methodology to diagnose what had really happened during the execution...|$|R
5|$|Macrinus {{realised}} {{that his}} life was in danger but struggled to decide upon <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> and remained at Antioch. He sent a force of cavalry commanded by Ulpinus Julianus {{to regain control of}} the rebels, but they failed and Ulpinus died in the attempt. This failure further strengthened Elagabalus' army. Soon after, a force under Elagabalus' tutor Gannys marched on Antioch and engaged Macrinus' army on 8 June 218 near the village of Immae, located approximately 24 miles from Antioch. At some point during the ensuing Battle of Antioch, Macrinus deserted the field and returned to Antioch. Macrinus was then forced to flee from Antioch as fighting erupted in the city as well. Elegabalus himself subsequently entered Antioch as the new ruler of the Roman Empire. Macrinus fled for Rome; he traveled as far as Chalcedon before being recognized and captured. His son and co-emperor Diadumenianus, sent to the care of Artbanus V of Parthia, was himself captured in transit at Zeugma and killed in June of 218. Diadumenianus' reign lasted a total of 14 months, and he was about 10 years old when he died. Macrinus, upon learning of his son's death, tried to escape captivity, but he injured himself in the unsuccessful attempt and was afterward executed in Cappadocia; his head was sent to Elegabalus. Much like Macrinus, Diadumenianus' head was also cut off and sent to Elegabalus as a trophy.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for Metternich the Tsar's dual {{proposal}} for the St Petersburg meetings, a settlement of the Eastern Question favourable to Russia and limited autonomy for three Greek principalities, was a pairing unpalatable to the other European powers, and potential attendees like British Foreign Secretary George Canning slowly turned away, much to the annoyance of Alexander. Metternich believed for several months afterward that he had gained a unique level of influence over the Tsar. Meanwhile, he renewed the conservative program he had outlined at Karlsbad five years before and sought to further increase Austrian influence over the German Federal Diet. He also informed the press {{they could no longer}} publicise the minutes of Diet meetings, only its rulings. In January 1825 he began to worry about his wife Eleonore's health and he reached her sickbed in Paris shortly before her death on 19 March. Mourning sincerely for her, he also took the opportunity to dine with the Paris elite. Unfortunately, an aside he made about the Tsar there was reported back and did not enhance his reputation. He left Paris for the last time on 21 April and was joined by the Emperor in Milan after arriving on 7 May. He declined the Pope's invitation to become a cardinal of the church. There was also a short trip to Genoa. Early in July the court dispersed and Metternich visited his daughters Leontine (fourteen) and Hermine (nine) in the quiet town of Bad Ischl. Despite the seclusion he received constant reports, including those of ominous developments in the Ottoman Empire, where the Greek revolt was rapidly being crushed by Ibrahim Ali of Egypt. He also had to deal with fallout from St. Petersburg where the Tsar, although unable to convene a full congress, had talked with all the major ambassadors. By mid-May it was clear the allies could not decide on <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> and, as such, the Holy Alliance was no longer a viable political entity.|$|E
