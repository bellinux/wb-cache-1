Glucose medium was used a substrate. Supplementary <b>acetate</b> and <b>butyrate</b> concentrations were ranged 0 to 500 mM and 0 to 250 mM, respectively. The increased concentration of <b>acetate</b> and <b>butyrate</b> significantly influenced to hydrogen production. At the initial condition, VFAs concentration of 0 g/L, maximum hydrogen was produced. The hydrogen production was decreased as increasing dosage of <b>acetate</b> and <b>butyrate.</b> The inhibitory effect by adding acetate on fermentative hydrogen production was less significant compared to that by butyrate. A modified Gompertz equation could be successfully described the cumulative H 2 production at different VFAs concentrations. In addition, the inhibition by adding VFAs on hydrogen production was described well by a non-competitive inhibition model...|$|R

The parameters, including reaction temperature, reaction time, feeding method of adding anhydrides, the dosage of total anhydrides to SCB, and the molar ratio of acetic anhydride to butyric anhydride, were considered, {{and the extent}} of acylation was measured by weight percent gain (WPG). The results showed the positive effects of reaction duration and total anhydride dosage on WPG and the negative effects of reaction temperature and molar ratio of AA/BA on WPG. The feeding method of acetylation after butyrylation resulted in the increased WPG compared with acetylation before butyrylation. FT-IR and 1 H– 13 C correlation 2 D NMR (HSQC) studies provided evidence for acylation. The bagasse <b>acetate</b> <b>butyrates</b> showed increased thermal stability after acylation.

5000|$|Cellulose acetate is {{also known}} as [...] "safety" [...] film and started to replace nitrate film in the 1920s.

The earliest, diacetate, was found to be inferior to nitrate because it had high shrinkage rates. Eastman Kodak then worked with mixed esters of cellulose to create <b>acetate</b> <b>butyrate</b> and acetate propionate, which were used for sheet film, X-rays, amateur roll film, and aerial maps, but they were still found to be inferior to nitrate by the motion picture industry. Triacetate was then produced and is still in production for roll film today.|$|E

40|$|The {{coupling}} {{of growth}} of the o -demethylating bacterium, Clostridium methoxybenzovorans SR 3, with a nitrate-reducing bacterium able to degrade aromatic compounds, Thauera sp. Cin 3, 4, allowed complete mineralization of poorly oxidizable methoxylated aromatic compounds such as vanillate, isovanillate, vanilline, anisate, ferulate and veratrate. C. methoxybenzovorans o -demethylated these aromatic compounds to their corresponding hydroxylated derivatives and fermented the side chains to <b>acetate</b> and <b>butyrate.</b> The hydroxylated compounds and the fermentation end-products in the C. methoxybenzovorans spent growth medium were then completely metabolized to CO 2 on inoculation with the Thauera strain. Kinetic studies with veratrate indicated that C. methoxybenzovorans initially o -demethylated the substrate to vanillate and then further to protocatechuate together with the production of <b>acetate</b> and <b>butyrate</b> from the demethylated side chains. Protocatechuate, <b>acetate</b> and <b>butyrate</b> were then utilized as a carbon source by the Thauera strain aerobically or anaerobically {{in the presence of}} nitrate.

40|$|The {{formation}} of acetone and n-butanol by Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 8052 (ATCC 824) was monitored in batch culture at 35 °C in a glucose (2 % [wt/vol]) minimal medium maintained throughout at either pH 5. 0 or 7. 0. At pH 5, good solvent production was {{obtained in the}} unsupplemented medium, although addition of <b>acetate</b> plus <b>butyrate</b> (10 mM each) caused solvent production to be initiated at a lower biomass concentration. At pH 7, although a purely acidogenic fermentation was maintained in the unsupplemented medium, low concentrations of acetone and n-butanol were produced when the glucose content of the medium was increased (to 4 % [wt/vol]). Substantial solvent concentrations were, however, obtained at pH 7 in the 2 % glucose medium supplemented with high concentrations of <b>acetate</b> plus <b>butyrate</b> (100 mM each, supplied as their potassium salts). Thus, C. acetobutylicum NCIB 8052, like C. beijerinckii VPI 13436, is able to produce solvents at neutral pH, although good yields are obtained only when adequately high concentrations of <b>acetate</b> and <b>butyrate</b> are supplied. Supplementation of the glucose minimal medium with propionate (20 mM) at pH 5 led {{to the production of}} some n-propanol as well as acetone and n-butanol; the final culture medium was virtually acid free. At pH 7, supplementation with propionate (150 mM) again led to the {{formation of}} n-propanol but also provoked production of some acetone and n-butanol, although in considerably smaller amounts than were obtained when the same basal medium had been fortified with <b>acetate</b> and <b>butyrate</b> at pH 7...|$|R

40|$|Gut dysbiosis might {{underlie}} {{the pathogenesis of}} type 1 diabetes. In mice of the non-obese diabetic (NOD) strain, we found that key features of disease correlated inversely with blood and fecal concentrations of the microbial metabolites <b>acetate</b> and <b>butyrate.</b> We therefore fed NOD mice specialized diets designed to release large amounts of <b>acetate</b> or <b>butyrate</b> after bacterial fermentation in the colon. Each diet provided {{a high degree of}} protection from diabetes, even when administered after breakdown of immunotolerance. Feeding mice a combined acetate- and butyrate-yielding diet provided complete protection, which suggested that <b>acetate</b> and <b>butyrate</b> might operate through distinct mechanisms. Acetate markedly decreased the frequency of autoreactive T cells in lymphoid tissues, through effects on B cells and their ability to expand populations of autoreactive T cells. A diet containing butyrate boosted the number and function of regulatory T cells, whereas acetate- and butyrate-yielding diets enhanced gut integrity and decreased serum concentration of diabetogenic cytokines such as IL- 21.
