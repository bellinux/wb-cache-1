5|$|On 24 October, {{it emerged}} that a Norwegian export credit company (Eksportfinans) {{had made a}} {{complaint}} to Norwegian police concerning the alleged embezzlement of 415 million Norwegian kroner (€47 million) by Glitnir since 2006. The Icelandic bank had acted as <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> Eksportfinans, administering loans to several companies: however Eksportfinans alleges that, when the loans were paid off early by borrowers, Glitnir kept the cash and merely continued with the regular payments to Eksportfinans, effectively taking an unauthorized loan itself.|$|E

5|$|With Americans {{in control}} of New Orleans, mail from Fort Stoddard, near Mobile, had to pass through Spanish {{territory}} to get there.

5|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Ken Flower, then the {{director}} of Rhodesia's Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), Harper's downfall {{was the result of}} an extramarital affair with a young secretary in the Rhodesian civil service who the CIO discovered was <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> MI6. Flower informed Smith of this on 3 July and the Prime Minister demanded Harper's resignation that afternoon; Harper acquiesced the next day. Because this was kept secret (presuming it is true), Harper's sudden departure from the Cabinet was interpreted by many observers at the time as the culmination of the personal and political rivalry between Smith and Harper, or the result of disagreements over the new constitution.|$|E
5|$|Angry at his {{treatment}} by the Byers enquiry, Scott sought {{other means of}} pursuing his vendetta against Thorpe. In June 1971 he met Gordon Winter, a South African journalist who was also <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> the South African intelligence agency BOSS. Scott provided details of his supposed seduction by Thorpe, a story which Winter assured his BOSS masters would destroy Thorpe and the Liberal Party. He found that no newspaper would print the story on largely uncorroborated and unreliable evidence. In March 1972 Scott's friend Gwen Parry-Jones died; Scott used the inquest to denounce Thorpe for ruining his life and driving Parry-Jones to her death. None of these accusations was published. Depressed, Scott retreated {{into a state of}} torpor, assisted by tranquilisers, and for a while presented no threat to Thorpe.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his service}} as governor, Morehead resumed his legal {{practice}} in Frankfort, Kentucky. In March 1837, he {{was commissioned by}} Governor James Clark to act as <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> the state, selling bonds to fund internal improvements. He returned to the state House from 1837 to 1838, representing Franklin County. He {{was president of the}} Kentucky Board of Internal Improvements from 1838 to 1841, and in 1839, he and John Speed Smith were chosen as commissioners to the state of Ohio to secure the return of Kentucky-owned slaves as property of their masters. They were successful in this endeavor.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, he {{accepted}} a teaching {{position at the}} ICY's preparatory school for boys. White furthered his interests in mathematics during his teaching stint at the institute. He became a lecturer on the subject while {{a member of the}} mathematics committee of the Banneker Institute, also becoming a proficient chess player in his leisure time. His exceptional skills with figures and calculations led to different business ventures: he was <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> the Anglo-African weekly newspaper (1860–1861) and Pine and Palm (1860–1862). In 1861, he became a representative at the Haitian Bureau of Emigration, empowering him with the transfers of funds for free blacks who sought to move to Haiti, via New York. As a result of his different ventures, White became a relatively wealthy man at a young age.|$|E
5|$|In October 1867, <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> Swift & Co. {{negotiated}} {{a deal with}} Peru to purchase Catawba and her sister for a million dollars apiece. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, initially indicated that the company could repurchase the pair if it refunded the government's costs to build them, but {{changed his mind and}} said that he had no authority to do that. Congress debated the issue and ultimately decided that they would be appraised by a board of officers and that the highest competitive bid in equal to or in excess of the appraised value would be accepted. The ship was appraised at $375,000 and sold for that amount, possibly after a rigged bid, on 11 April 1868.|$|E

5|$|Perfect Dark is {{an action}} video game {{developed}} {{and published by}} Rare. It was exclusively released for the Game Boy Color handheld game console in August 2000, shortly {{after the release of}} its Nintendo 64 counterpart. The game takes place in the year 2022, one year prior to the events of the Nintendo 64 game, and follows the exploits of Joanna Dark as she attempts to prove herself as <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> the Carrington Institute agency. The gameplay revolves around shooting opponents and completing objectives such as rescuing hostages or recovering items. It also features a multiplayer mode where two players may compete in several deathmatch modes.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} factors contributed to the {{collapse}} of this initial resistance and to nearly all non-Muslim majority princely states agreeing to accede to India. An important factor was the lack of unity among the princes. The smaller states did not trust the larger states to protect their interests, and many Hindu rulers did not trust Muslim princes, in particular Hamidullah Khan, the Nawab of Bhopal and a leading proponent of independence, whom they viewed as <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> Pakistan. Others, believing integration to be inevitable, sought to build bridges with the Congress, hoping thereby to gain a say in shaping the final settlement. The resultant inability to present a united front or agree on a common position significantly reduced their bargaining power in negotiations with the Congress. The decision by the Muslim League {{to stay out of the}} Constituent Assembly was also fatal to the princes' plan to build an alliance with it to counter the Congress, and attempts to boycott the Constituent Assembly altogether failed on 28 April 1947, when the states of Baroda, Bikaner, Cochin, Gwalior, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Patiala and Rewa took their seats in the Assembly.|$|E

5|$|A soft, silvery-white {{radioactive}} metal, actinium reacts rapidly {{with oxygen}} and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and many actinides, actinium assumes oxidation state +3 {{in nearly all}} its chemical compounds. Actinium is found only in traces in uranium and thorium ores as the isotope 227Ac, which decays with a half-life of 21.772 years, predominantly emitting beta and sometimes alpha particles, and 228Ac, which is beta active with a half-life of 6.15 hours. One tonne of natural uranium in ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium-227, and one tonne of natural thorium contains about 5 nanograms of actinium-228. The close similarity of {{physical and chemical properties}} of actinium and lanthanum makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical. Instead, the element is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of 226 in a nuclear reactor. Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium has no significant industrial use. Its current applications include a neutron source and <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> radiation therapy targeting cancer cells in the body.|$|E
5|$|In June 1987, as {{a private}} venture, BAe, McDonnell Douglas, and Smiths Industries signed an MoU for the {{development}} of what was to become the AV-8B Plus, which saw the addition of radar and increased missile compatibility. The agreement was endorsed by the USMC and, after much consideration, the Spanish and Italian navies developed a joint requirement for a fleet of air-defense Harriers. The United States, Spain, and Italy signed an MoU in September 1990 to define the responsibilities of the three countries and establish a Joint Program Office to manage the program. On 30 November 1990, the USN, acting as <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> the three participating countries, awarded McDonnell Douglas the contract to develop the improved Harrier. The award was followed by an order from the USMC in December 1990 for 30 new aircraft, and 72 rebuilt from older aircraft. Italy ordered 16 Harrier II Plus and two twin-seat TAV-8B aircraft, while Spain signed a contract for eight aircraft. Production of the AV-8B Harrier II Plus was conducted, in addition to McDonnell Douglas' plant, at CASA's facility in Seville, Spain, and Alenia Aeronautica's facility in Turin, Italy. The UK also participated in the program by manufacturing components for the AV-8B.|$|E
5|$|Off-stage, Robey led {{an active}} {{lifestyle}} {{and was a}} keen amateur sportsman. He {{was proud of his}} healthy physique and maintained it by performing frequent exercise and following a careful diet. By the time he was in his mid-thirties, he had played as an amateur against Millwall, Chelsea and Fulham football clubs. He organised and played in many charity football matches throughout England, which were described by the sporting press as being of a very high standard, and he remained an active football player well into his fifties. Robey became associated with cricket by 1895 when he led a team of amateur players for a match at Turney Road in Dulwich. In September 1904, while appearing in Hull, he was asked by the cricketer Harry Wrathall {{to take part in a}} charity cricket match at the Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Robey played so well that Wrathall asked him to return the following Saturday to take part in a professional game. That weekend, while waiting in the pavilion before the game, Robey was approached by <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> Hull City A.F.C., who asked the comedian to play in a match that same afternoon. Robey agreed, swapped his cricket flannels for a football kit and played with the team against Nottingham Forest as an inside right.|$|E

5|$|Starting in March, Braathens SAFE {{took over}} KLM's routes from Stavanger to Amsterdam, {{and started a}} new route from Trondheim to Amsterdam. From 26 March 1998, Braathens SAFE moved its flights to London from Gatwick to London Stansted Airport. At the same time, it {{announced}} {{that the number of}} daily services from Oslo to London would increase from one to three, following the opening of Gardermoen. In addition, KLM-partner AirUK would become <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> Braathens SAFE, and the company hoped that 40% of the sales on the route would be sold in the United Kingdom. The agreement also involved a codesharing agreement with AirUK, including some onwards flights from London, notably the route to Dublin. At the same time, Braathens SAFE announced that the airline would start selling more discounted tickets on the London-flights, to compete with Ryanair's new route from Stanstad to Sandefjord Airport, Torp.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1914, Sledd {{resigned}} the presidency of Southern University and returned to Emory College, by then renamed Emory University and relocated to its new main campus in northeast Atlanta, as the first Professor of Greek and New Testament Literature at the Candler School of Theology, the newly established seminary of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Sledd became well known {{as a professor of}} Greek, Latin and New Testament studies at Candler, and was the author of several scholarly books on New Testament subjects, including Saint Mark's Life of Jesus (1927), The Bibles of the Churches (1930) and His Witnesses: A Study of the Book of Acts (1935). He was selected {{to be a member of}} the American Standard Bible Committee, which was preparing a revision of the American Standard Version of the Bible. He continued to advocate internal Methodist reform and an end to racial violence, and his teaching inspired a generation of his Candler theology students to act as change agents within the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Many of his former students became Methodist ministers who returned to their congregations and annual conferences to work for better treatment of African-Americans, helping the Southern Methodist church to evolve from a mainstay of theological and racial intransigence to <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> social change and doctrinal reform.|$|E
