40|$|A {{range of}} options for utilising {{additional}} land on a dairy farm in the high rainfall area of Gippsland were analysed. The aim {{was to determine if}} additional land may assist the owners/operators in maintaining or increasing profit in the medium term (5 - 10 years). Historical trends have been towards fewer, larger, more intensive enterprises, and this project studies the value of additional land in continuing or altering this trend. A case study farm and spreadsheet modelling approach was used to examine these issues. Five different uses for additional land were identified by an expert steering committee, and were compared to the base farm system over a 10 -year development period. The results suggest that expanding the milking area by purchasing additional land without a significant increase in herd size (2 A) increased annual operating profit by approximately $ 70, 000 /year without increasing variability when compared to the base farm system. This was the only option examined to earn a high enough internal rate of return on additional capital investment to justify the investment without capital gains. <b>Additional</b> <b>milking</b> area with a substantial increase in stocking rate (2 C) significantly reduced annual operating profit (by approximately $ 70, 000 /year) and notably increased the variability of these returns. The purchase of an outblock for conserved fodder production improved profitability, but would require some capital gains to be an attractive option on profit measures alone. The most appropriate changes to dairy farm businesses in response to changes in the operating environment will vary from farm to farm. The analysis indicated that simple following previous industry trends may not be appropriate on many farms. Optimising the amount of home grown feed and efficiently using purchased supplements are important, particularly if the milk produced is subject to the fluctuations of an export milk price.

40|$|To compare milk yields between cows or {{management}} strategies, lactations {{are traditionally}} standardized to 305 -d yields. The 305 -d yield, however, gives no {{insight into the}} combined effect of <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> yield before calving, decreased milk yield after calving, and a possible shorter calving interval {{in the case of}} a shortened dry period. We aimed to develop a measure that would enable the comparison of milk yield between cows with different dry period (DP) lengths. We assessed the importance of accounting for <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> yield before calving and for differences in calving interval. The 305 -d yield was compared with a 365 -d yield, which included <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> yield in the 60 d before calving. Next, an effective lactation yield was computed, defined as the daily yield from 60 d before calving to 60 d before the next calving, to account for <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> yield before calving and for differences in calving interval. Test-day records and drying-off dates of 15 commercial farms were used to compute the 305 -d, 365 -d, and effective lactation yields for individual cows. We analyzed 817 second-parity lactations preceded by no DP, a short DP (20 to 40 d), or a conventional DP (49 to 90 d). Compared with cows with a conventional DP, the 305 -d yield of cows with no DP was 7. 0 kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) per day lower, and the 305 -d yield of cows with a short DP was 2. 3 kg of FPCM per day lower. Including <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> yield before calving in the 365 -d yield reduced this difference to 3. 4 kg of FPCM per cow per day for cows with no DP and to 0. 9 kg of FPCM per cow per day for cows with a short DP. Compared with cows with a conventional DP, median days open were reduced by 25 d for cows with no DP and by 18 d for cows with a short DP. Accounting for these differences in calving interval in the effective lactation yield further decreased yield reductions for cows with no DP or a short DP by 0. 3 kg of FPCM per cow per day. At the herd level, estimated 365 -d yield losses for cows with no DP or a short DP differed from effective lactation yield losses by 0. 4 to - 0. 8 kg FPCM per cow per day. Accounting for <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> yield before calving had a major and consistent effect on yield comparisons of cows with different DP lengths. The effect of correcting for calving interval was more variable between farms and will especially be important when calving interval is affected by DP length. </p...|$|R

However, due to {{recent changes in}} the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), milk quotas will be abolished by 2015. Therefore, the European dairy sector will soon face an opportunity, {{for the first time}} in a generation, to expand. Numerous studies have shown that milk production in Ireland will increase significantly post quotas (Laepple and Hennessy (2010), Donnellan and Hennessy (2007) and Lips and Reider (2005)). The research in this thesis explored milk transport and dairy product processing in the Irish dairy processing sector in the context of milk quota removal and expansion by 2020. In this study a national milk transport model was developed for the Irish dairy industry, the model was used to examine different efficiency factors in milk transport and to estimate milk transport costs post milk quota abolition. Secondly, the impact of different milk supply profiles on milk transport costs was investigated using the milk transport model. Current processing capacity in Ireland was compared against future supply, it was concluded that <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> processing capacity would not be sufficient to process the <b>additional</b> <b>milk.</b> Thirdly, the milk transport model was used to identify the least cost locations (based on transport costs) to process the <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> supply in 2020.

An alternative approach for control using methods approved for organic production are sprays based on teas made from compost, both actively aerated (ACT) and non-aerated (NCT) compost teas, and sprays made from diluted milk. We evaluated these sprays for control of powdery mildew on pumpkins in field trials in Connecticut in 2008 and 2009, and in greenhouse trials in 2009. We also evaluated the compost teas and milk in the greenhouse in 2009, as well as additives, like liquid seaweed and humic acid, used to enhance the effectiveness of compost teas. Applications were applied to the leaves before disease symptoms were noticed and visual assessments of the plants were made on a weekly basis. In 2008 both the ACT and NCT treatments applied in combination with a milk spray significantly reduced the incidence of powdery mildew compared with compost tea applied without the <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> spray. In 2009 the treatments were changed to evaluate the effect of milk applied alone, and the compost teas were evaluated without the <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> application. In both locations the compost teas provided no control of powdery mildew when compared to the untreated control plots. The milk treatment provided significantly less disease than the untreated control, and the chemical treatment had equal or significantly less disease than the milk. In greenhouse trials the milk treatment was as effective as the chemical control, and the enhancer products, liquid seaweed and humic acid, were as effective as the compost teas at suppressing powdery mildew with all treatments reducing disease when compared with the untreated control. These results suggest that enhancers added to compost teas may provide as much control as the teas, and milk may be an effective control for powdery mildew on pumpkins. Both organic and conventional growers could benefit from using milk in place of the fungicides typically sprayed to control powdery mildew...|$|R

40|$|The results {{revealed}} that the supply of milk through Crossbred cows is sensitive to the price change in area covered {{under the umbrella of}} cooperatives. The milk yield of Crossbred cows being higher and the potentiality of increasing the milk through cross-breeding, feeding and management being high, the liquid milk supply could be increased substantially with proper pricing policy of Crossbred cow milk. Further, since the price of milk of Crossbred cow was lower compared to Murrah buffaloes (superior breed of buffalo), this breed of cattle showed higher sensitivity to unit increase in the price of milk and it was particularly true in the case of area covered by cooperatives.

40|$|Surveys {{were made}} of rural artisan cheese {{factories}} located {{in the region of}} Olancho, Catacamas, and Juticalpa in Honduras (n= 10) and in Esquipulas and Muy-Muy in Nicaragua (n= 13). The objective was to analyze the milk market of small rural artisan cheese factories in livestock watersheds of Honduras and Nicaragua to determine if there is a market for higher milk production; how much <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> can the market absorb in each season of the year; there is a market for milk of higher hygienic quality. The main buyer of the milk from small and medium scale farmers in Honduras and Nicaragua is the rural artisan cheese industry, which absorbs almost 80 % of the milk produced in both countries. Total milk production during the rainy season is about twice that during the dry season, causing an over-supply and scarcity of milk, respectively. The shortage of fluid milk during the dry season leads to an unsatisfied market. The artisan cheese factories in Honduras and Nicaragua would be willing to buy 76 % and 55 % more milk during the dry season, but this supply is not available due low milk productivity. This fact suggests that an aggressive program for the promotion of shrub legumes with sugarcane to supplement the herd during the dry season would have more impact that the promotion of grasses or legumes for the rainy season when there is little market for <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> produced. In addition, rural artisan cheese factories in Honduras and Nicaragua, that consider the milk they collect is of bad quality, {{would be willing to pay}} a higher price if the option to collect milk of better hygienic quality exists. In Honduras this price would be about 9 % higher during the dry season and 11 % higher during the rainy season.

40|$|China has an {{ever-increasing}} thirst for milk, with a predicted 3. 2 -fold increase in demand by 2050 {{compared to the}} production level in 2010. What are the environmental implications of meeting this demand, {{and what is the}} preferred pathway? We addressed these questions by using a nexus approach, to examine the interdependencies of increasing milk consumption in China by 2050 and its global impacts, under different scenarios of domestic milk production and importation. Meeting China's milk demand in a business as usual scenario will increase global dairy-related (China and the leading milk exporting regions) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 35 % (from 565 to 764 Tg CO 2 eq) and land use for dairy feed production by 32 % (from 84 to 111 million ha) compared to 2010, while reactive nitrogen losses from the dairy sector will increase by 48 % (from 3. 6 to 5. 4 Tg nitrogen). Producing all <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> in China with current technology will greatly increase animal feed import; from 1. 9 to 8. 5 Tg for concentrates and from 1. 0 to 6. 2 Tg for forage (alfalfa). In addition, it will increase domestic dairy related GHG emissions by 2. 2 times compared to 2010 levels. Importing the extra milk will transfer the environmental burden from China to milk exporting countries; current dairy exporting countries may be unable to produce all <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> due to physical limitations or environmental preferences/legislation. For example, the farmland area for cattle-feed production in New Zealand would have to increase by more than 57 % (1. 3 million ha) and that in Europe by more than 39 % (15 million ha), while GHG emissions and nitrogen losses would increase roughly proportionally with the increase of farmland in both regions. We propose that a more sustainable dairy future will rely on high milk demanding regions (such as China) improving their domestic milk and feed production efficiencies up to the level of leading milk producing countries. This will decrease the global dairy related GHG emissions and land use by 12 % (90 Tg CO 2 eq reduction) and 30 % (34 million ha land reduction) compared to the business as usual scenario, respectively. However, this still represents an increase in total GHG emissions of 19 % whereas land use will decrease by 8 % when compared with 2010 levels, respectively...|$|R

The study included 36 in-depth interviews of mothers with infants aged 0 - 11 months, and health care professionals, including general practitioners, pediatricians, and midwives. This study was performed between 0 cto ber - November 2 0 l 0 in both rural and urban areas of 4 provinces in Indon esia. Results We found that most mothers intended to breastfeed and had positive perceptions of breastfeeding. However, mothers faced many challenges in the practice of exclusive and proper breastfeeding. Additionally, the perceived definition of exclusive breastfeeding varied among the participants, leading  to n on-exclusive breastfeeding attitudes. The most frequent reasons for mothers to introduce <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> formula or food were the perception of an inadequate milk supply, infant dissatisfaction or fu ssiness after feeding.

40|$|Background: In 2010 {{contamination}} by dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs {{was detected}} in milk and {{meat in the}} valley Engidalur situated {{at the bottom of}} a fjord (Skutulsfjörður) in North West Iceland. The valley is narrow and surrounded by high mountains resulting in prevailing calm weather. The contamination was traced to a small municipal waste incinerator operating in the valley. Annual agricultural production in Engidalur was modest (≈ 6 tons of meat and 45 tons of milk). The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority conducted a series of measurements examining the contamination and the results are reported in this paper. Results: Earlier inspection of the waste incinerator had shown dioxin levels in fly ash of 2. 1 ng I-TEQ/m 3, which exceeded the EU maximum limit of 0. 1 ng I-TEQ/m 3. Late in 2010 routine inspection found 4. 0 pg WHO-TEQ/g for PCDD/Fs and 7. 4 pg total WHO-TEQ/g fat in one milk sample from a farm in Engidalur; levels exceeding the EU maximum limits of 3. 0 and 6. 0 pg WHO-TEQ/fat for dairy fat, respectively. These results were confirmed in an <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> sample. Elevated levels exceeding the maximum limits were also observed in one out of two beef samples collected from the farm (4. 7 pg WHO-TEQ/g for dioxins and 12. 3 pg total WHO-TEQ/g fat). Elevated levels in lamb and ewe meat were also observed but concentration varied greatly, reflecting different migration routes of animals during summer grazing and different sources of hay used during winter.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to summarize management practices, identify factors associated with bacterial counts, and describe the variation in total solids concentrations of milk or milk replacer in automated feeders. Six dairy calf operations in Virginia and 4 in Minnesota employing 1 to 2 sophisticated automated calf feeders were visited biweekly for 26 to 28 wk. An initial management survey was conducted for each farm. Observations on facilities, calf weights and heights, blood samples to estimate serum total proteins, treatment records, digital feeding behavior records, and milk or milk replacer (MMR) samples were collected at each visit. <b>Additional</b> <b>milk</b> replacer (MR) samples were collected for 4 wk pre- and post-circuit cleaning. Samples of MMR were plated on Aerobic Plate Count (APC) and Coliform Count (CCP) Petrifilms. Total solids concentration was estimated for MR samples by refractometry. Feeding plans varied widely between farms. Estimates of calf growth were near industry standards, but the proportion of calves receiving treatment was elevated. Least squares mean APC and CCP were 5. 26 and 3. 01 log 10 cfu/ml for Virginia and 3. 80 and 0. 61 log 10 cfu/ml for Minnesota. Circuit cleaning (CC) caused 13 and 16 % log reduction in APC and CCP. However, more frequent CC/wk increased bacteria. Mixer/heat exchanger cleanings decreased bacteria during biweekly farm visits. Chlorine bleach reduced bacteria. Use of silicone feeder hoses increased bacteria. A quadratic effect of MMR liters delivered/d was observed; liters delivered> 147 L decreased APC.

40|$|Background: Nondietary {{exposure}} to milk proteins {{may be a}} risk for children who do not outgrow milk allergy by school age. Objective: To study the allergenicity of casein containing chalk. Methods: A 6 -year-old, milk allergic child developed asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis while in school. The suspected cause was dust-free chalk containing casein. To study the relationship of dust-free chalk containing casein with asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis, 13 <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> allergic patients were studied: 3 school-aged children, 8 preschool-aged infants, and 2 children with outgrown milk allergy. Skin tests and/or specific IgE with chalk and casein were performed. A chalk use test was performed in older children. Milk allergens contained in chalk were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblot, and IgE inhibition experiments. Results: All school-aged, milk allergic children were exposed to chalk and reported symptoms attributed to chalk exposure. The skin test result to chalk was positive in 5 of 12 cases, and the specific IgE test result was positive in all 12 study participants {{in which it was}} performed. Casein strongly inhibited the binding of IgE to chalk. Chalk sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed proteins with molecular weight similar to caseins. Immunoblot demonstrated strong binding of IgE to chalk in a blurred pattern and a band at 30 kDa, inhibited by casein. The chalk challenge test result was positive in 2 school-age children who had a positive skin test result to chalk. Their symptoms improved after avoidance of chalk in the school. In 2 other cases in which the challenge test result was negative, chalk was reintroduced without problems. Conclusion: Inhalation of chalk dust containing casein can induce asthma symptoms in milk allergic patients. Hidden and nondietary sources of exposure should always be considered in food allergic patients...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{national}} reports from Denmark, Finland, Italy and Norway, describing the school meal systems {{and to which}} extent organic food is integrated there, this report identifies differences between the four countries and experiences made with organic food procurement and the dissemination of organic ingredients in school meals. Such knowledge will help to understand the possibilities and restrictions for increasing organic food in school meal systems, and to reveal the room of manoeuvre for public organic food procurement for youth in each country. In the report, similarities and differences of the national school meal systems in general are first discussed, because this context determines the scope of organic food procurement. The history and current situation of the school meal systems, framework conditions of public food procurement in schools (laws, guidelines, control, financing), {{the structure of the}} school meal provision and public discourses about school meals are described. Next, focus is set on the use and development of organic food in school meal systems. Some school meal system cases are presented by the amount of organic food used, the arguments for organic school food and challenges and barriers for the dissemination of organic food. Finally, school meal system actors in general as well as “organic” actors such as promoters, decision makers, companies and organisations are compared across the four countries. Summarizing chapters are found {{at the end of each}} section of the report. In short, warm meals are served for free to all pupils daily in Finland, and subsidized according to family income to all pupils at least twice a week in Italy. Norway and Denmark stick to a packed lunch brought from home, with <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> and fruit subscription schemes and a developing additional or complementary meal service especially in Denmark with subsidized prices. Organic food is much emphasised in Italy and Denmark; significantly less in Finland and Norway...|$|R
40|$|In this 2 -year {{randomized}} controlled study of 167 men > 50 years of age, supplementation with calcium-vitamin D 3 -fortified <b>milk</b> providing an <b>additional</b> 1000 mg of calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D 3 per day was effective for suppressing PTH and stopping or slowing bone loss at several clinically important skeletal sites {{at risk for}} fracture. Introduction: Low dietary calcium and inadequate vitamin D stores have long been implicated in age-related bone loss and osteoporosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effects of calcium and vitamin D 3 fortified milk on BMD in community living men > 50 years of age. Materials and Methods: This was a 2 -year {{randomized controlled}} study in which 167 men (mean age ± SD, 61. 9 ± 7. 7 years) were assigned to receive either 400 ml/day of reduced fat (1 %) ultra-high temperature (UHT) milk containing 1000 mg of calcium plus 800 IU of vitamin D 3 or to a control group receiving no <b>additional</b> <b>milk.</b> Primary endpoints were changes in BMD, serum 25 (OH) D, and PTH. Results: One hundred forty-nine men completed the study. Baseline characteristics between the groups were not different; mean dietary calcium and serum 25 (OH) D levels were 941 ± 387 mg/day and 77 ± 23 nM, respectively. After 2 years, the mean percent change in BMD was 0. 9 - 1. 6 % less in the milk supplementation compared with control group at the femoral neck, total hip, and ultradistal radius (range, p 50 years of age with reduced-fat calcium- and vitamin D 3 -enriched milk may represent a simple, nutritionally sound and cost-effective strategy to reduce age-related bone loss at several skeletal sites at risk for fracture in the elderly. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This thesis compares {{growth and}} {{behaviour}} of domestic sows and piglets in confined pens versus get-away pens (where sows could leave their fitters at will), {{to ask whether}} parent-offspring conflict occurs, whether it increases with offspring age, whether it involves offspring access to the udder, and whether it affects animal production or welfare. Parent-offspring conflict occurs in domestic pigs: piglets of Confined sows suckled more and ate less solid food but grew {{at the same rate}} as piglets from Get-away sows, indicating they obtained more milk. Confined sows lost more weight than Get-away sows and returned to oestrus later, indicating a fitness cost of providing the <b>additional</b> <b>milk.</b> Parent-offspring conflict increased with piglet age: as the fitter aged, Get-away sows spent more time away from their young and the differences between Get-away sows and Confined sows in weight loss and nursing frequency increased. In Get-away sows, the reduction in contact with their young occurred rapidly, but its timing varied greatly among individual sows. Behavioural conflict over access to the udder is a plausible mechanism by which conflict is expressed in swine: piglets from Confined pens spent more time nuzzling the udder than piglets of Get-away sows. Piglets from Get-away sows nuzzled the udder a higher proportion of the time when the sow was present than piglets from Confined sows. Get-away sows terminated more nursings than Confined sows thus limiting the amount of contact piglets had with the udder after nursing. Mowing sows to control maternal provisioning improved productivity: there was a slight benefit of reduced time to the next oestrus for Get-away sows. Piglets from Get-away sows gained more weight and consumed more food after weaning than piglets from Confined sows. There was only slight evidence that get-away pens reduced behavioural indicators of post-weaning stress (e. g., movements, vocalizations, response to playback of vocalizations) for either the p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of liquid milk supplement on litter performance (weight development of the piglets, weaning weight and mortality) and on sow back-fat thickness change during the suckling period. Data were collected from 150 litters, with the weight of a total of 1709 piglets measured at birth, at 14 days of age and at weaning (28 days), respectively. Sow (n = 150) back-fat depth was measured the day before farrowing, 14 days after farrowing and at weaning. In the control group (n = 363), the piglets were suckled and got pre-starter feed from day 10. In the four experimental groups (MS 1; MS 2; MS 2 and MS 4; n = 1346), the piglets received <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> replacer in various concentrations from the 10 th day of life. While there were no significant differences in birth weight between the control and experimental groups, we did find significant differences between the 14 -day weights and weaning weights. The milk supplement significantly reduced mortality compared to the control (11. 6 vs. 4. 9; 5. 9, 8. 9; 8. 3 %). However, there were no statistically significant differences between litter homogeneity data, based on the CV% of piglet weight. Three experimental groups (MS 1, MS 2 and MS 4) were more homogenous compared to the control group at weaning (25. 3 vs. 20. 9; 20. 3; 20. 3 CV%). Based on the examination of sow back-fat thickness reduction, there were significant differences between the control (C) and MS 3 groups (7. 61 vs. 5. 57 mm reduction, P < 0. 05) during the suckling period. These results demonstrate the advantage of milk replacer on weaning weight. Litter homogeneity, piglet mortality and back-fat thickness of the sows were affected by providing milk replacer to the piglets during the suckling period...|$|R
40|$|Optimising {{production}} {{is an important}} aspect in pig farming. Despite the fact that nowadays sows are able to reach a high litter size born alive, postnatal piglet mortality remains a problem in many pig farms. Due to the increased litter size, the birth weight of individual piglets is lower and as a consequence, the chances of survival of certain piglets are very low. It is therefore important that every piglet can consume enough milk. To ensure this, <b>additional</b> <b>milk</b> can be supplied in the farrowing crate, for example by introducing Rescue Cups. This means an extra cost for the pig farmer and the effects on production parameters of the piglets must be considered. To this end, 1, 710 piglets from 127 sows were followed during a suckling period of 22 days, from which 854 piglets (from 63 sows) had access to extra milk using Rescue Cups (treatment group) and 856 piglets (from 64 sows) had no access to extra milk (control group). The piglets in the treatment group had access to extra milk {{from the age of}} 4 days until the age of 15 days. Birth weight, weaning weight and piglet mortality were recorded as production parameters. Data were analysed using the generalized linear mixed model. No significant difference was found in piglets mortality. The mean mortality rate however was already very low (7, 53 %). This shows that the management in general at the pig fram in this study was already good. There was no difference found in daily growth rate. The uniformity within the litters does not seem to increase when extra milk was provided. This might be {{due to the fact that}} not only small piglets drink milk from the cups, but also heavier piglets. There was also no difference found in weaning weight between treatment and control group within the group of piglets with the lowest weaning weight. status: publishe...|$|R
