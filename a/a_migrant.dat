A justice system is present to punish criminals, for example, dwarves who injure or kill another dwarf or destroy furniture. Occasionally, a vampire dwarf, with a fake background history, may arrive with <b>a</b> <b>migrant</b> wave and start killing and feeding on the other citizens without being noticed.|$|E

The team resided at <b>a</b> <b>migrant</b> hostel, which at the time was primarily occupied by Vietnamese refugees from the Vietnam War. Brooks spoke out {{about the quality of the}} accommodation, leading officials to make improvements.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} {{generally}} resident across its range, but sightings of solitary and silent birds {{have suggested that}} the species may be migratory in Bolivia and Brazil.

In 2006 the species was reported {{for the first time in}} Peru, but it was unclear if this represented a vagrant escaping cold weather or <b>a</b> <b>migrant,</b> as the species is mostly uncommon across its range and that area is poorly studied ornithologically.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} remittance behavior for Vietnam {{using data from the}} 2004 Vietnam Migration Survey on internal migrants. It considers how, among other things, the vulnerability of <b>a</b> <b>migrant's</b> life at the destination, their link to relatives back home, and the time spent at the destination affect remittances. The paper finds that migrants act as risk-averse economic agents and send remittances back to the household of origin as part of an insurance exercise in the face of economic uncertainty. Remittances are also found to be driven by <b>a</b> <b>migrant's</b> labor market earnings level. The paper highlights the important role of remittances in providing an effective means of risk-coping and mutual support within the family...|$|R

5|$|The {{work may}} have been {{intended}} for private devotion, perhaps as a portable altarpiece for <b>a</b> <b>migrant</b> cleric. That the frames are so richly decorated with Latin inscriptions indicates that the donor, whose identity is lost, was highly educated and cultured. Because {{of a lack of}} surviving documentary evidence on commissions of 15thcentury-Northern painting, the identities of donors are often established through evidence gathered by modern art historians. In this work, damaged coats of arms on the borders of the interior wings have been identified with the Giustiniani of Genoa– an influential albergo active from 1362– who established trade links with Bruges as early as the mid-14th century.|$|E
5|$|For decades Haitians {{have been}} {{crossing}} the Haitian-Dominican border for various reasons, including voluntary and involuntary migration, long- and short-term {{residence in the}} Dominican Republic, legal and illegal entry, smuggling, and human trafficking. Haitians move across the Haitian-Dominican border in search of opportunities and they are highly vulnerable to exploitation. In fact, the Dominican Republic {{has one of the}} worst records of human rights abuses, including human trafficking, against migrant workers in all of the Caribbean. Haitians in the Dominican Republic are widely disparaged as <b>a</b> <b>migrant</b> minority because of the countries' proximity. During the dictatorial reign of Jean-Claude Duvalier in the 1970s and 80s, he sold Haitians at bulk rates to work on sugar plantations in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Want was {{published}} with an essay by Carlos Bulosan {{as part of}} the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as <b>a</b> <b>migrant</b> laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.|$|E

5|$|Lihou is also {{a common}} family name on Guernsey, with records {{suggesting}} that the name has been in use in the Channel Islands {{since at least the}} eighteenth century, including Royal Navy Captain John Lihou, who discovered and named the Australian Port Lihou Island and Lihou Reef. The name {{is also a}}ttested further afield, {{in a number of other}} countries such as Australia, where for example, Sergeant James Lihou, the son of <b>a</b> <b>migrant</b> from Guernsey, enlisted in the Australian forces in 1916 and was killed in action in 1918 in France. There are also numerous instances of people with the surname having migrated from the Channel Islands to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Looms {{were not}} {{controlled}} by the guilds. Dependent on <b>a</b> <b>migrant</b> workforce, their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported. The entrepreneur was {{in direct contact with}} the patron, and they would often go through the nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by Colart de Laon having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's – and presumably his commissioner's – considerable embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|Castro {{was born}} out of wedlock at his father's farm on August 13, 1926. His father, Ángel Castro y Argiz, was <b>a</b> <b>migrant</b> to Cuba from Galicia, Northwest Spain. He had become financially {{successful}} by growing sugar cane at Las Manacas farm in Birán, Oriente Province and after the collapse of his first marriage he took his household servant, Lina Ruz González – of Canarian origin – as his mistress and later second wife; together they had seven children, among them Fidel. Aged six, Castro was sent to live with his teacher in Santiago de Cuba, before being baptized into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of eight. Being baptized enabled Castro to attend the La Salle boarding school in Santiago, where he regularly misbehaved, so he was sent to the privately funded, Jesuit-run Dolores School in Santiago. In 1945, Castro transferred to the more prestigious Jesuit-run El Colegio de Belén in Havana. Although Castro took an interest in history, geography and debating at Belén, he did not excel academically, instead devoting much of his time to playing sports.|$|E

30|$|We {{hypothesize that}} {{individuals}} with a larger social-family network {{are more likely to}} choose self-employment. We test this hypothesis using data on temporary rural–urban migrants in China. The size of <b>a</b> <b>migrant’s</b> social-family network is measured by the number of relatives and friends this migrant greeted during the past Spring Festival. After controlling for endogeneity using an instrumental variable approach, our results show that <b>a</b> rural–urban <b>migrant</b> with <b>a</b> larger social-family network {{is more likely to be}} self-employed. This finding is robust to alternative model specifications and various restrictions on the estimation sample.|$|R
5|$|The Mumbai Police {{announced}} its move to put Raj under their custody on 13 February, which created an upsurge {{of violence in}} the state and led to two deaths. Attacks on North Indians were reported from Mumbai, Pune, Jalna, Beed, Aurangabad and Latur. Shops, offices and other business establishments were shut down in different parts of Mumbai, as MNS workers threatened violence in case their leader was arrested. Central Mumbai localities were most affected, especially around Dadar and Shivaji Park, the strongholds of both the MNS and the Shiv Sena. The police blocked roads in front of the residence of Raj in the Shivaji Park area. A civic activist named James John was assaulted by suspected MNS workers while he was attempting to photograph them forcing shop owners to down shutters in JB Nagar, Andheri. John suffered two rib fractures and bruises on his lungs. In Nashik, an employee of the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, a Maharashtrian, died during a stone pelting on state-run buses by MNS supporters. <b>A</b> <b>migrant</b> from Bihar, who was a security guard with a private company at Igatpuri in Nashik district, was killed by a mob.|$|E
