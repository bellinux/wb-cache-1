5|$|Since tool use is {{considered}} to be a key feature of primate intelligence, the apparent lack of this behavior in wild lemurs, as well as the lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce the perception that lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins. However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of tool functionality in both the ring-tailed lemur and the common brown lemur and discovered that, like monkeys, they used tools with functional properties (e.g., tool orientation or ease of use) instead of tools with nonfunctional features (e.g., color or texture). Although the ring-tailed lemur may not use tools in the wild, it can not only be trained to use <b>a</b> <b>tool,</b> but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to use <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use of tools may not have appeared until much later.|$|E
