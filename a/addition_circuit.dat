40|$|We {{investigate}} the theoretical {{limits of the}} effect of the quantum interaction distance on the speed of exact quantum <b>addition</b> <b>circuits.</b> For this study, we exploit graph embedding for quantum circuit analysis. We study a logical mapping of qubits and gates of any Ω(n) -depth quantum adder circuit for two n-qubit registers onto a practical architecture, which limits interaction distance to the nearest neighbors only and supports only one- and two-qubit logical gates. Unfortunately, on the chosen k-dimensional practical architecture, we prove that the depth lower bound of any exact quantum <b>addition</b> <b>circuits</b> is no longer Ω(n), but Ω(√(n)). This result, the first application of graph embedding to quantum circuits and devices, provides a new tool for compiler development, emphasizes the impact of quantum computer architecture on performance, and acts as a cautionary note when evaluating the time performance of quantum algorithms.

40|$|Abstract: In a {{conventional}} binary floating-point number arithmetic system, two’s complement number represen-tation {{is often used}} to perform addition/subtraction in a floating-point adder. Since the significand of an addition operand is usually expressed as a sign-magnitude number representation, the swapping operation of two operands and the carry propagation in the addition will limit the arithmetic speed. In this paper, we introduce a radix-two signed-digit(SD) number arithmetic to the floating-point number arithmetic. Then the swapping operation is not required and the carry propagation becomes free for the inner addition. We present an <b>addition</b> <b>circuit</b> architecture using the SD arithmetic with a normal binary floating-point number representation in both input and output.

Multiple solutions of resource allocation were derived based on convex optimization or game theory via lowering power consumption under certain constraints, such as minimizing the outage probability [22 - 24], maximizing energy efficiency [25 - 28], maximizing overall throughput [29, 30], maintaining service quality, or maximizing the sum of SUs’ capacities and signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) [31]. Joint relay selection and power allocation schemes are proposed by factoring the cost of acquiring channel state information (CSI) to minimize the total energy consumption [32].
