25|$|In {{order to}} design a system without the {{shortcomings}} of the straight air system, Westinghouse invented a system wherein each piece of railroad rolling stock was equipped with an air reservoir and a triple valve, also known as <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
500|$|On {{the same}} day that the sealed {{atmosphere}} experiment was terminated, 24 April 1960, Triton experienced a major equipment failure. [...] In the after torpedo room, a hydraulic line to the stern plane mechanism burst. [...] Through the prompt action by Torpedoman's Mate Third Class Allen W. Steele, aided by Engineman Third Class Arlan F. Martin, this potentially catastrophic event was successfully contained. Eventually, the main hydraulic system was restored with <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> from the steering system, but the boat's steering controls remained on emergency mode {{for the rest of the}} voyage. It was subsequently determined that the pipe burst was caused by a fractured valve. [...] For his quick and decisive actions in handling this emergency, Steele was presented the Navy Commendation Medal.|$|E
2500|$|The rig {{comprised}} {{a rubber}} breathing/buoyancy bag containing a canister of barium hydroxide to scrub exhaled CO2 and, {{in a pocket}} {{at the lower end}} of the bag, a steel pressure cylinder holding approximately [...] of oxygen at a pressure of [...] The cylinder was equipped with <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> and was connected to the breathing bag. Opening the cylinder's valve admitted oxygen to the bag at ambient pressure. The rig also included an emergency buoyancy bag on the front of to help keep the wearer afloat. The DSEA was adopted by the Royal Navy after further development by Davis in 1927.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> flow <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> {{regulates the}} flow or {{pressure}} of <b>a</b> fluid. <b>Control</b> <b>valves</b> normally respond to signals generated by independent {{devices such as}} flow meters or temperature gauges.|$|R
50|$|This method {{demands that}} the {{appropriate}} pumps provide precisely constant flow of the material. Flow of material is started by <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>valve</b> and stopped after a certain time.|$|R
50|$|Valve loft is {{intentionally}} using <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>valve</b> {{float to}} increase lift {{and duration of}} the valve open cycle. In some motorsports there are rules that limit camshaft lift; therefore, provoking this type of exploitation. Properly optimizing the system avoids undue stresses to the camshaft lobes and tappets.|$|R
2500|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} PID controller {{is the ability to}} use the three control terms of proportional, integral and derivative influence on the controller output to apply accurate and optimal control. The block diagram on the right shows the principles of how these terms are generated and applied. It shows a PID controller which continuously calculates an error value [...] as the difference between a desired setpoint SP= and a measured process variable PV=, and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms. The controller attempts to minimize the error over time by adjustment of a control variable , such as the opening of <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> to a new value determined by a weighted sum of the control terms.|$|E
2500|$|Tuning - The {{balance of}} these effects is {{achieved}} by [...] "loop tuning" [...] (see later) to produce the optimal control function. The tuning constants are shown below as [...] "K" [...] and must be derived for each control application, as they depend on the response characteristics of the complete loop external to the controller. These are dependent on the behaviour of the measuring sensor, the final control element (such as <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve),</b> any control signal delays and the process itself. Approximate values of constants can usually be initially entered knowing the type of application, but they are normally refined, or tuned, by [...] "bumping" [...] the process in practice by such as introducing a setpoint change and observing the system response.|$|E
2500|$|To do this, a {{controller}} {{with the}} requisite corrective behaviour is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares {{it with the}} reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the error signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are [...] controllability and observability. On this is based the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries. This is feedback control, which is usually continuous and involves taking measurements using a sensor and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range {{by means of a}} [...] "final control element", such as <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E

The conclusion is that installing <b>a</b> pressure-difference <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> can increase hydraulic stability, and reduce pump head and pump energy consumption. The application of terminal control has the smallest energy consumption, but flow variation scope is narrower than everything else...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{measurement}} of static characteristics of <b>a</b> pressure <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> The pressure, at which the valve starts to leak oil, is adjusted by a spring. The measurement is performed on a hydraulic system that consists of tank, hydraulic pump, check valve, relief <b>valve</b> and pressure <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> which is measured.

50|$|A handle {{is used to}} {{manually}} <b>control</b> <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> {{from outside}} the <b>valve</b> body. Automatically <b>controlled</b> <b>valves</b> often do not have handles, but some may have a handle (or something similar) anyway to manually override automatic <b>control,</b> such as <b>a</b> stop-check valve. An actuator is a mechanism or device to automatically or remotely <b>control</b> <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> from outside the body. Some valves have neither handle nor actuator because they automatically control themselves from inside; for example, check valves and relief valves may have neither.|$|R

50|$|Chrysler {{has made}} various {{revisions}} to the 5.7 L for the 2009 model year. The first for all applications is what Chrysler calls Variable Camshaft Timing or VCT. VCT (which is essentially variable valve timing) uses <b>an</b> oil <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> which <b>controls</b> oil flow to a unique camshaft sprocket which contains a phasing device, which depending on {{the operation of the}} oil <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> either advances or retards camshaft timing.|$|R
