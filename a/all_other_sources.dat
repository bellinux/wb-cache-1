5|$|Even though {{social impact}} of {{television}} in Croatia {{is considered to}} be imperfect and that of variable quality, television is important in the society because it offers a way for non-governmental organizations to communicate their concerns to the public and to criticize the government and other aspects of politics of Croatia.

That percentage varies significantly by geographic regionfrom 43% in Zagreb and areas surrounding the capital to 79% in Slavoniabut in every region it surpasses <b>all</b> <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> of information, the second most widely used source of information being the Internet averaging at 19%.

5|$|Knowing {{that their}} {{camp on the}} Szamos could easily be attacked, the rebels marched towards Kolozsvár in October or November. They invaded and pillaged the Báthorys' estates at Fejérd (Feiurdeni). They also {{captured}} and beheaded many noblemen before attacking the abbey and forcing the abbot to flee. A group of rebels took possession of Nagyenyed {{with the assistance of}} its poor burghers and the inhabitants of the nearby villages. Most burghers of Kolozsvár also sympathized with the rebels, who thus entered the town without resistance. A Saxon charter recorded that Antal Nagy de Buda died fighting against the noblemen before 15 December.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} {{differences between the}} original manuscripts and Mathers' edition.

Second, Mathers gave the duration of the operation as six months, whereas <b>all</b> <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> specify eighteen months. Third, possibly due to a mistranslation, Mathers changed one of the ingredients within the recipe for Abramelin oil, specifying galangal instead of the original herb calamus. The oil in the German manuscript sources also contains cassia and is nearly identical to the biblical recipe for Holy anointing oil. The differences between the recipes cause several notable changes in the oil's characteristics, including edibility, fragrance, dermal sensation, and spiritual symbolism. Fourth, there are 242 word squares in Mathers' translation, while the original German has 251. Most of the squares in Mathers are not completely filled in, and those that are differ markedly from the German sources.|$|E

50|$|A {{variation}} of the Source Four PAR is the Source Four PARNel, a wash lighting fixture intended to be an alternative for Fresnel lanterns. The name PARNel is a portmanteau of PAR and Fresnel. The PARNel operates with 750-, 575- or 375-watt HPL lamps that are compatible with <b>all</b> <b>other</b> <b>Source</b> Four fixtures. Unlike traditional Fresnel lanterns, where adjusting the light beam between flood and spot is accomplished by moving the {{lamp and reflector assembly}} relative to the lens, the PARNel is focused by rotating a stippled lens. It can be focused from 25- to 47-degree field angles. The PARNel also uses the enhanced aluminum reflector technology, which theoretically allows a 575 watt lamp to output more light than a standard 1000 watt Fresnel lantern.|$|R
500|$|Pope John XXII {{addressed}} Basarab as a [...] "devout Catholic prince" [...] in {{a letter}} written on 1 February 1327.

According to scholar Neagu Djuvara, this correspondence with the Holy See proves that Basarab was a Catholic, which also testifies to Basarab's Cuman origin, because the Cumans had been baptized according to Catholic rite. Historians Matei Cazacu and Dan Mureșan reject Djuvara's theory, saying that <b>all</b> <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> prove that Basarab was an Eastern Orthodox.

[...] Among the most striking flags in the illustrations are the elongated ceremonial streamers, shown flying from all ships in varying numbers. These feature a Saint George red cross on white ground on the hoist, nearest the flagpole, and a very long tail striped in green and white. They all feature gold paint on the red and green, and silver paint (now oxidized to black) on the white. This artistic device was used either to simulate the fluttering of the flags or to actually display the metallic thread and paint that was sometimes used to decorate them.|$|E
