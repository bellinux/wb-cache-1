25|$|<b>Art</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{a matter}} of taste, but {{involves}} the whole man. Whether in making or perceiving a work of art, we bring to bear on it feeling, intellect, morals, knowledge, memory, and every other human capacity, all focused in a flash on a single point. Aesthetic man is a concept as false and dehumanising as economic man.|$|E
25|$|Although visual <b>art</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{popular in}} Somalia due to {{prevailing}} beliefs that it contradicts Islam's proscription on {{all forms of}} idolatry, {{a lot of the}} known visual art in the country derives from the small historical town of Merca. Known for its beautiful white sandy beaches and orange dunes, the city's picturesque contrast of colors serves as an inspiration for local visual artists.|$|E
25|$|The {{artist is}} a not great creator—Duchamp went {{shopping}} at a plumbing store. The artwork {{is not a}} special object—it was mass-produced in a factory. The experience of <b>art</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> exciting and ennobling—at best it is puzzling and mostly leaves one {{with a sense of}} distaste. But over and above that, Duchamp did not select just any ready-made object to display. In selecting the urinal, his message was clear: Art is something you piss on.|$|E

25|$|To scholars, {{the use of}} unpegged joints seems odd, if not eccentric, and is {{not found}} in well established, ancient Mediterranean {{shipbuilding}} traditions. This approach allowed Egyptian boats used in trade to be easily disassembled, the planks transported long distances through the desert and then re-assembled to be used on important trading routes {{such as those in}} the Red Sea. There are pictographs of boats dating from Predynastic Egypt and the First Dynasty along {{the first half of the}} route in the desert known to be used to reach the Red Sea from Upper Egypt. A sketch on an ostracon found at depicts priests carrying the Solar Bark of Amun across the desert. This rock <b>art</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> only evidence for take apart, portable boats, but has magical significance as well.|$|E
25|$|The art of {{the ancient}} Near East, and also in archaic Greece, used only the frontal and profile view. Only {{classical}} Greek style introduced an intermediate step, especially the three-quarter view. Representations of the classical Greeks tried the illusion of life in all its forms. The characters are totally preoccupied with themselves and ignore the viewer. The frontal view is also found here, but {{is only one of}} many possibilities. Parthian art certainly took over the frontal view of Hellenistic art, but it appears the Parthians in their art again took recourse with the presence of the Ancient Orient. The Parthian <b>art</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an illusion and tried to capture the fleeting nature of life. Rather, they tried to give the figures durability. They tried to capture the true content of life and not just the outer shell. The effect of such methods is often that the viewer feels transcended.|$|E
25|$|The Met's {{collection}} of Islamic <b>art</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> confined strictly to religious art, though {{a significant number}} of the objects in the Islamic collection were originally created for religious use or as decorative elements in mosques. Much of the 12,000 strong collection consists of secular items, including ceramics and textiles, from Islamic cultures ranging from Spain to North Africa to Central Asia. The Islamic Art department's {{collection of}} miniature paintings from Iran and Mughal India are a highlight of the collection. Calligraphy both religious and secular is well represented in the Islamic Art department, from the official decrees of Suleiman the Magnificent to a number of Qur'an manuscripts reflecting different periods and styles of calligraphy. Modern calligraphic artists also used a word or phrase to convey a direct message, or they created compositions from the shapes of Arabic words. Others incorporated indecipherable cursive writing within the body of the work to evoke the illusion of writing.|$|E

500|$|Public <b>art</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{new to the}} Gateway Mall. In 1940, a large Carl Milles {{work was}} {{installed}} outside St. Louis Union Station.

In 1982, Richard Serra's Twain—a sculpture comprising eight large plates of weathering steel—was installed on the [...] block immediately west of Citygarden, creating Serra Sculpture Park.|$|E
500|$|In Stuart Nicholson's words, [...] "Mehldau's <b>art</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{based on}} {{negotiating}} {{his way through}} a harmonic sequence with a string of bravura licks [...] Instead he patiently weaves melodic developments from motifs, fragments and inversions of the [...] songs he plays into the fabric of his extemporizations, making the tunes gradually assume the proportions of an alternative composition." [...] Fordham stated that [...] "Mehldau demonstrates immense attention to detail, control of dynamics, and patience in developing an improvisation's shape over a longer span than the chorus-structure of a popular song." ...|$|E
500|$|Corresponding {{with general}} {{developments}} within feminism, and often including such self-organizing tactics as the consciousness-raising group, the movement {{began in the}} 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s. Jeremy Strick, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, described the feminist art movement as [...] "the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period", and Peggy Phelan says that it [...] "brought about the most far-reaching transformations in both artmaking and art writing {{over the past four}} decades". Feminist artist Judy Chicago, who created The Dinner Party, a set of vulva-themed ceramic plates in the 1970s, said in 2009 to ARTnews, [...] "There is still an institutional lag and an insistence on a male Eurocentric narrative. We are trying to change the future: to get girls and boys to realize that women's <b>art</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an exception—it's a normal part of art history." [...] A feminist approach to the visual arts has most recently developed through Cyberfeminism and the posthuman turn, giving voice to the ways [...] "contemporary female artists are dealing with gender, social media and the notion of embodiment".|$|E

500|$|As a symbol, an urn cannot {{completely}} represent poetry, {{but it does}} {{serve as}} one component in describing the relationship between art and humanity. The nightingale of [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is separated from humanity and does not have human concerns. In contrast, being a piece of art, the urn requires an audience and is in an incomplete state on its own. This allows the urn to interact with humanity, to put forth a narrative, and allows for the imagination to operate. The images on the urn provoke the narrator to ask questions, and {{the silence of the}} urn reinforces the imagination's ability to operate. This interaction and use of the imagination is part of a greater tradition called ut pictura poesis – the contemplation of art by a poet – which serves as a meditation upon art itself. In this meditation, the narrator dwells on the aesthetic and mimetic features of art. The beginning of the poem posits that the role of art is to describe a specific story about those with whom the audience is unfamiliar, and the narrator wishes to know the identity of the figures {{in a manner similar to}} [...] "Ode on Indolence" [...] and [...] "Ode to Psyche". The figures on the urn within [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] lack identities, but the first section ends with the narrator believing that if he knew the story, he would know their names. The second section of the poem, describing the piper and the lovers, meditates on the possibility that the role of <b>art</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to describe specifics but universal characters, which falls under the term [...] "Truth". The three figures would represent how Love, Beauty, and Art are unified together in an idealised world where art represents the feelings of the audience. The audience is not supposed to question the events but instead to rejoice in the happy aspects of the scene in a manner that reverses the claims about art in [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". Similarly, the response of the narrator to the sacrifice is not compatible with the response of the narrator to the lovers.|$|E

[...] The handbook states, “…. the exhibition at the NMAA argues that this <b>art</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an objective account of history and that <b>art</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> necessarily history; seeing is not necessarily believing.” ...|$|E

2500|$|A 1962 quote {{is often}} used to {{summarize}} Gould's perspective on art: [...] "The justification of art is the internal combustion it ignites in the hearts of men and not its shallow, externalized, public manifestations.

2500|$|In any case, {{the debate}} is purely modern: {{it is clear that}} most Byzantine viewers did not {{consider}} their art to be abstract or unnaturalistic. As Cyril Mango has observed, [...] "our own appreciation of Byzantine art stems largely from the fact that this <b>art</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> naturalistic; yet the Byzantines themselves, judging by their extant statements, regarded it as being highly naturalistic and as being directly in the tradition of Phidias, Apelles, and Zeuxis." ...|$|E
