5|$|The {{value of}} {{treasure}} Morgan collected during his expedition is disputed. Talty {{writes that the}} figures range from 140,000 to 400,000 pesos, and that owing to the large army Morgan assembled, the prize-per-man was relatively low, causing discontent. There were accusations, particularly in Exquemelin's memoirs, that Morgan left away {{with the majority of}} the plunder. He arrived back in Port Royal on 12 March to a positive welcome from the town's inhabitants. The following month he made his official report to the governing Council of Jamaica, and received their formal thanks <b>and</b> <b>congratulations.</b>|$|E

5|$|Constantinople was {{the nerve}} {{centre of the}} Byzantine state. Had it fallen, the Empire's {{remaining}} provinces would have been unlikely to hold together, and would have become easy prey for the Arabs. At the same time, {{the failure of the}} Arab attack on Constantinople was a momentous event in itself. It marked the culmination of Mu'awiya's campaign of attrition, pursued steadily since 661. Immense resources were poured into the undertaking, including the creation of a huge fleet. Its failure had similarly important repercussions, and represented a major blow to the Caliph's prestige. Conversely, Byzantine prestige reached new heights, especially in the West: Constantine IV received envoys from the Avars and the Balkan Slavs, bearing gifts <b>and</b> <b>congratulations</b> and acknowledging Byzantine supremacy. The subsequent peace also gave a much-needed respite from constant raiding to Asia Minor, and allowed the Byzantine state to recover its balance and consolidate itself following the cataclysmic changes of the previous decades.|$|E

In Kenya, the home country of Obama's father, people celebrated the inauguration as a public holiday. Indonesians and Americans in Jakarta watched the inauguration at a free midnight ball featuring performances by students from State Elementary School Menteng 01, the school that Obama attended as a child. The city of Obama in Japan celebrated the event with fireworks, bell-ringing and hula-dancing at the Hagaji Temple. Governor General Michaëlle Jean and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada extended congratulations on behalf of Canadians, while Mexican President Felipe Calderón wished Obama [...] "great success in the work as the new President of the United States".

500|$|Early on {{the second}} day, D'Oliveira batted with less certainty. He was dropped by the {{opposition}} wicket-keeper with his score on 31, but he was encouraged by the umpire Charlie Elliott and his batting partner John Edrich. As his score reached fifty, Elliott whispered, [...] "Well played—my God you're going to cause some problems." [...] D'Oliveira went on to score 158 runs before he was out, although he was dropped {{a few more times}} after passing three figures. He received a prolonged ovation from the crowd when he was out, <b>and</b> <b>congratulations</b> from John Gleeson, one of the opposing Australians. Oborne assesses the innings {{as one of the best}} ever: despite the relatively weak attack and easy batting conditions, Oborne believes that no other cricketer had faced so much pressure and so many outside forces conspiring against him. Later in the game, D'Oliveira also contributed with the ball. After rain had reduced the amount of playing time and caused further delays through the subsequent clean-up, England faced a race against time to win the match. D'Oliveira took a crucial wicket with his 12th ball to break a long partnership and open the way for Derek Underwood to bowl England to victory in the game and a share in the series.|$|E

Viceroys crew recovered brandy which had been aboard U-1274 from the water and built a presentation case for it; the First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Andrew Cunningham, sent it to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who, in a note of 12 May 1945, expressed thanks to Cunningham and Viceroys crew for the [...] "interesting souvenir" [...] <b>and</b> <b>congratulations</b> on the sinking.|$|E

In her second letter to Sigismund August, written in response to his letter, Hürrem expresses in superlative terms her joy at hearing that the king is in good health and that he sends assurances of his sincere friendliness and attachment towards Sultan Süleyman the Magnificent. She also quotes the sultan as saying, [...] "with the old king we were like brothers, and if it pleases the All-Merciful God, with this king we will be as father and son."

2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the battle, Sampson’s flagship the New York approached the Brooklyn. [...] Schley sent the message by signal flag: “The enemy has surrendered” and “We have gained a great victory.” Against common practice {{at the end of a}} victorious battle, Sampson did not respond with the expected congratulatory remark, but rather, according to historian Joseph G. Dawson, [...] "the answering signal was terse and seemed needlessly brusque." [...] After these messages were exchanged, more tension grew between the two officers when Schley requested that he and his crew should [...] "have the honor of the surrender of the Cristobal Colon." [...] With disregard to Schley and the other commanding officers, Sampson cabled Secretary Long, [...] "The fleet under my command offers the nation as a Fourth of July present the whole of Cevera’s fleet," [...] invoking General William T. Sherman's message to Abraham Lincoln after taking Atlanta in 1864, but making no reference to Schley. A day after the news reached the United States, the New York Times published an article with the headline, [...] "Sampson's Fourth of July Victory," [...] expressing gratitude towards Sampson for his leadership during the Battle of Santiago. In Sampson's hometown of Palmyra, New York, a respectful one hundred shots were fired for his victory.

2500|$|The ACNA has {{established}} friendly ecumenical {{relationships with the}} Roman Catholic Church. The RCC was represented by Bishop Kevin Vann at their inaugural Provincial Assembly, in Bedford, Texas, on 22 June 2009. In October 2009, ACNA's leadership reacted to the Roman Catholic Church's proposed creation of personal ordinariates for disaffected traditionalist Anglicans by stating that although they believe that this provision will not be utilized by {{the great majority of}} its laity and clergy, they will happily bless those who are drawn to participate in this proposal. The ACNA expressed his support for the RCC in her opposition to the HHS mandate, with Archbishop Robert Duncan being one of the signatories of the statement of the Christian Associates of Southwest Pennsylvania, representing 26 Christian denominations, on 13 April 2012. Archbishop Duncan and Bishop Ray Sutton were also invited to the weekly private audience by Pope Benedict XVI, which took place in Rome, on 28 November 2012, whom they meet and greet afterwards on behalf of the ACNA and the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans. The ACNA Provincial Assembly, which reunited more than 900 participants, and their College of Bishops conclave, which elected Foley Beach as the second Archbishop of the province, took place at the Roman Catholic Benedictine St. Vincent Archabbey Basilica, in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, from 19–21 June 2014, due to the kind permission of Archabbot Douglas Robert Nowicki, a personal friend of Archbishop Duncan. Archbishop Wilton Daniel Gregory of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta offered Foley Beach an African-made crozier, which he used at his investiture ceremony, that took place at the Church of the Apostles, in Atlanta, Georgia, at 9 October 2014. Former Archbishop Gregory Venables of the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone of America read at the ceremony a message by his personal friend Pope Francis, who sent Archbishop Foley Beach his [...] "personal greetings <b>and</b> <b>congratulations</b> as he leads his church in the very important job of revival" [...] and asked Archbishop Venables to embrace him on his behalf.|$|E
