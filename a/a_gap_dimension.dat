S-layer proteins are a diverse class of molecules found in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and most archaea 1 - 5. S-layers protect {{cells from the}} outside, provide mechanical stability and also play roles in pathogenicity. In situ structural information about this highly abundant class of proteins is scarce, so atomic details of how S-layers are arranged {{on the surface of}} cells have remained elusive. Here, using purified Caulobacter crescentus' sole S-layer protein RsaA, we obtained a 2. 7 Å X-ray structure that shows the hexameric S-layer lattice. We also solved a 7. 4 Å structure of the S-layer through electron cryotomography and sub-Tomogram averaging of cell stalks. The X-ray structure was docked unambiguously into the electron cryotomography map, resulting in a pseudo-Atomic-level description of the in vivo S-layer, which agrees completely with the atomic X-ray lattice model.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the gap between current and optimal status of curriculum leadership in the postgraduate courses in two Iranian universities. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a sample of 212 faculty members from the two Iranian universities (one medical and one nonmedical) was randomly selected through stratified random sampling method. Data were collected by using a researcher-made questionnaire, with 55 items categorized in four areas of main dimensions in curriculum leadership. The validity of the questionnaire was determined by curriculum studies scholars, and the reliability was confirmed as the Cronbach′s alpha calculated 0. 969. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics according to the variables. Results: There was <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> in all <b>dimensions</b> and roles.

In other words, there has been so little research done in this area, so that the researchers couldn't present the clear image of caring dimensions.

Methods: This descriptive study was performed on 240 nursing students in Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The participants were selected through stratified random sampling method. The data were collected using Wade’s inventory for nursing students’ perception of instructor caring (NSPIC). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics in SPSS 13 software. Results: The level of nursing instructors' caring behavior during teaching students was medium to high with the mean and standard deviation of 4. 65 (0. 93), as the highest level belonged to the respectful sharing, and then respectively, instill confidence through caring, appreciation of life meanings, supportive learning climate, and control versus flexibility.

This technology uses photographic process to create a resist layer on a thin (about 0.007 in) copper foil on a dielectric backing (thin circuit board material) etched into tuned resonator arrays, each individual resonator being in a [...] "C" [...] shape (or other shape—such as a square).

40|$|Building a {{scalable}} {{quantum computer}} {{is one of}} the most interesting and difficult problems facing the world of physics today. The requirements for building such a machine are stringent and a number of critical challenges must be overcome before it is achieved. This thesis represents an effort to mitigate some of the challenges for the donor based Kane quantum computer and its derivatives. At the Centre of Quantum Communication and Computation, UNSW, we use scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) lithography to place individual phosphorus donors into the lattice of isotopically pure 28 Si. For phosphorus in silicon (Si:P) based quantum computation, a complete understanding of tunnelling rates between planar, STM patterned regions is crucial to control and operate single electron transistors and charge sensors. Furthermore, tunnelling rates between qubits is vitally important in information flow through a quantum computer. In this thesis, systematic sets of atomically precise tunnel gaps are fabricated and characterised. From this we extract the dependence of tunnel rates and potential barriers as <b>a</b> function of <b>gap</b> <b>dimensions</b> and discuss suitable modelling methods for the simulating tunnelling devices and qubits. A fundamental component of STM patterned Si:P device architecture is the two dimensional, planar, phosphorus doped delta-layer. We characterise the energy quantisation of delta layers by two separate experimental techniques, which, through an international collaboration, is compared to atomistic tight-binding models. Schottky barrier spectroscopy is used to measure the density of states of delta layers across a range of doping densities, while STM spectroscopy is used to investigate the variation and disorder of the delta-layer. To assist in qubit coherence times, a new dynamical decoupling scheme to preserve quantum states during quantum computation is investigated. Combining ideas from separate dynamical decoupling sequences a dramatic increase in qubit coherence times is achieved, in a way that is robust to common experimental errors. Finally, an improved quantum algorithm is presented for the dihedral hidden subgroup problem. By augmenting a subexponential time algorithm with a quantum search, I show an improvement of five orders of magnitude for the common 256 bit key size in lattice based cryptography over previously described algorithms, and optimise the size of the quantum search in the new algorithm for best performance...|$|R
