The main aim of the thesis was to define the term statutory limitations of an authorized representative's competence to act on behalf the company, find its examples in the Czech Commercial Code and analyse the consequences of not following those limitations.

40|$|Legitimacy of {{licensing}} individual {{financial advisers}} through third party licensees is currently debated {{by the media}} and in practice, with unsubstantiated claims evident in the majority of commentaries.

This not only advances financial planning theory, but raises further questions for future empirical research, which should provide policymakers data required to make evidence-based decisions around licensing advisers...|$|R

40|$|Refusal {{to sell to}} 'unauthorised' dealers is an {{integral}} part of a selective distribution system. Under such a system <b>manufacturers</b> <b>authorise</b> only those dealers meeting their specific requirements. Where the market involved is 'reasonably competitive' it is widely recognised that manufacturers, dealers and consumers can gain. The British Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) has been criticised for its interpretation of what constitutes a 'reasonably competitive' market. In a recent report into the supply of fine fragrances the issue was again central to its findings that the selective distribution system was not against the public interest. The European Commission has also recently granted exemption from Article 85 for the distribution system operated by the leading firms. We argue that the MMCs analysis of competition was again flawed in this case and that the danger to the consumer and new entrants is compounded by the Europe-wide exemption.
