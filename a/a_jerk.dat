5|$|It is Christmas in Bikini Bottom and Plankton is {{miserable and}} angry for {{committing}} so many naughty deeds, {{that he always}} gets on Santa's naughty list, making him unable to receive his Christmas wishthe Krusty Krab's Krabby Patty secret formula. However, he discovers Jerktonium, a dangerous chemical element {{which serves as a}} trap for the citizens of Bikini Bottom and is capable of turning anyone into <b>a</b> <b>jerk.</b> He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into jerks. In order to test it, Plankton gives SpongeBob a slice, but nothing seems to work on SpongeBob, who is immune to Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his very big heart. Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, Plankton gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and transforms all the residents into jerks. After realizing that the element works only on other people in Bikini Bottom instead and that SpongeBob is so full of Christmas spirit that he is immune to jerktonium, Plankton is forced to send out an evil wind-up robot version of SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob.|$|E

When studying the film at varying speeds, it still appeared as if he straightened his arm, even though the brace {{makes it impossible to}} do so. His unique shoulder rotation and amazing wrist action seem to create the illusion that he straightens his arm.|$|E

25|$|In the 1998 TV Series Hercules, Helen {{appears as}} a {{supporting}} character at Prometheus Academy as a student. Helen is caring and enthusiastic. She {{was the most popular}} girl in the academy and Adonis' girlfriend. Helen tries her best to keep Adonis from being <b>a</b> <b>jerk</b> but mostly fails. She likes Hercules but as a friend. She is a princess as in the myth but is not a half-sister of Hercules in the series. She was voiced by Jodi Benson.|$|E
25|$|Signals are {{combinations}} of pulls and bells, A pull {{is a relatively}} long steady tension on the line. Bells are always given in pairs, or pairs followed by the remaining odd bell. They are short tugs, and a pair is separated by a short interval, with a longer interval to the next pair or the single bell. The technique and nomenclature derive from the customary sounding of the ships bell every half-hour during the watches, which is also performed in pairs, with the odd bell last. One bell is not used as a diving signal as {{it is difficult to}} distinguish it from <b>a</b> <b>jerk</b> caused by temporarily snagging the line.|$|E
25|$|Travis {{has been}} {{compared}} to other characters in fiction, primarily action characters. Game Revolution editor Jesse Constantino comments that while Grasshopper Manufacture tries to portray him as punk, he's no more punk than his grandmother's doll collection, comparing him to Sam Spade of The Maltese Falcon. He was also described as what the love child between Fight Clubs Tyler Durden and Kill Bills The Bride would be. Game designer Steve Gaynor compared Travis' clothing to Durden's as well. He {{has been compared}} to another character from Goichi Suda in the video game Flower, Sun, and Rain called Sumio Mondo. Gaming Nexus editor Matt Mirkovich praised the voice work of his voice actor Robin Atkin Downes, calling it one of the best works in gaming. Game Style editor Garry Webber described him as an unashamedly geeky otaku as well as an amoral contemptuous assassin, but added that this was why he was so likable. G4 TV editor Matt Kiel stated that Travis is an especially noteworthy aspect of the quality plot, adding that while he's amoral and <b>a</b> <b>jerk,</b> {{he is one of the}} most likable video game characters in a long time. Fox News editor Lou Kesten described Travis as the Wii's most ridiculously violent hero. He was awarded best new character of 2008 by GamePro magazine, and was nominated by GameSpot for the same award.|$|E

5000|$|One {{particular}} style requires the dancer to take (in <b>a</b> <b>jerking</b> motion) quick steps, stomp, twists and throwing {{their arms around}} all while moving to a beat, the best example being Crunchy Black's style, referred to as G-Walking. The style is considered the basis of all Gangsta Walking done in Memphis since the 1980s.|$|R

500|$|Schur {{said the}} writing staff had {{difficulty}} scripting {{the scene where}} Ann kisses Andy: [...] "We {{had a lot of}} discussions about this because we didn't want Ann to be too much of <b>a</b> <b>jerk</b> and kiss a guy who likes another girl, and we didn't want Andy to be too much of <b>a</b> <b>jerk</b> because he likes April. It was very delicate." [...] The episode marked a turning point for the romantic subplot between April and Andy, who shared their first kiss of the series in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti". Goor said filming of that scene, [...] "They nailed the kiss immediately." [...] While trying to get April to talk to him, Andy pretends he doesn't want to talk to her at all, which he incorrectly calls [...] "reverse psychiatry" [...] instead of reverse psychology. This line was improvised by Chris Pratt.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Carl Fredricksen has received mostly positive reception. Bill Capodagli, author of Innovate the Pixar Way, praised Carl {{for his ability}} to be <b>a</b> <b>jerk</b> and likable at the same time. Wall Street Journal editor Joe Morgenstern described Carl as gruff, comparing him to Buster Keaton, but adds that this begins to wear thin as the movie progresses. He has been compared with Spencer Tracy, an influence on the character, by The Washington Post editor Ann Hornaday and Empire Online editor Ian Freer, who describes him as similar to a [...] "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner-era" [...] Tracy.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{produced}} in stop motion animation at Screen Novelties, and was directed by Mark Caballero and Seamus Walsh, two {{of the founders of}} the company. The animation style was inspired by those of the classic Rankin/Bass television specials. Written by Luke Brookshier, Marc Ceccarelli, Derek Iversen, and Mr. Lawrence, [...] "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!" [...] was based on Tom Kenny and Andy Paley's 2009 song [...] "Don't Be <b>a</b> <b>Jerk</b> (It's Christmas)", which was also featured in the episode. John Goodman guest starred as the voice of Santa Claus. On November 6, 2012, the soundtrack album and the DVD for the episode were released simultaneously.|$|E

500|$|Konner and Rosenthal were {{rewriting}} the script even as sets were being constructed. Ari, Helena Bonham Carter's character, was originally a princess. She {{was changed to}} [...] "a Senator's daughter with a liberal mentality". One of the drafts had General Thade, Tim Roth's character, as an albino gorilla, but Burton felt chimpanzees were more frightening. Limbo, Paul Giamatti's character [...] "was supposed {{to turn into a}} good guy. There was supposed to be this touching personal growth thing at the end," [...] Giamatti reflected. [...] "But Tim [...] and I both thought that was kind of lame so we decided to just leave him as <b>a</b> <b>jerk</b> into the end." ...|$|E
500|$|Another major {{breakthrough}} was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans would be revealed as the film's true villain only near the end. Hans {{was not even}} in the earliest drafts, then at first was not a villain, and after becoming one, was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot. Del Vecho said, [...] "We realized [...] was most important [...] {{if we were going to}} make the ending so surprising you had to believe at one point that Hans was the answer... he's not the answer, it's Kristoff... f you can get the audience to leap ahead and think they have figured it out you can surprise them by turning it the other way." [...] Lee acknowledged that Hans was written as [...] "sociopathic" [...] and [...] "twisted" [...] throughout the final version. For example, Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters: [...] "He mirrors [...] and he's goofy with her... he Duke [...] is <b>a</b> <b>jerk,</b> so he's <b>a</b> <b>jerk</b> back. And with Elsa he's a hero." [...] It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans' betrayal of Anna too predictable, in that the audience had to [...] "feel... her feeling something but not quite understanding it... Because the minute it is [...] it deflated." [...] At one point, Anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him, but that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans.|$|E
500|$|The next day, SpongeBob {{begins to}} notice that {{everyone}} in town is behaving like jerks. SpongeBob meets Sandy at her treedome, and she was <b>a</b> <b>jerk,</b> too. SpongeBob accidentally drops a piece of fruitcake in Sandy's Christmas Magic Analyzer, which shows that {{it is filled with}} Jerktonium. He and Sandy discover the antidote for Jerktonium to cure the residents in Bikini Bottom is a song called [...] "Don't Be <b>a</b> <b>Jerk</b> (It's Christmas!)." [...] SpongeBob sings it, bringing back the residents' Christmas spirit. Unfortunately, it was too late when Santa arrives and states that everyone is on his naughty list, except for Plankton, who is the only nice person there is, which has earned him the Krabby Patty formula, much to Mr. Krabs shock. SpongeBob tries to convince Santa that this is all a mistake, but Santa refuses to believe him, saying he's the worst of all, being blamed for his robot doppelganger's deeds. The wind-up robot shows up to eliminate Santa, but SpongeBob fights the robot with the fruitcake dispenser and finally destroys it, clearing his name. Santa thanks SpongeBob for saving him, which shows that SpongeBob is good, but then he finds the robot's wind-up key by reading [...] "If found, please return to the Chum Bucket," [...] revealing that Plankton was behind all the chaos, and punishes Plankton by giving him, once again, a stocking of coal. Santa lets the residents of Bikini Bottom celebrate the holiday, and he leaves Bikini Bottom, only for Patrick Star to capture him in a jellyfish/butterfly net and throw him off-course.|$|E

5000|$|Clean: The kettlebell {{is held in}} {{the rack}} {{position}} (resting on the forearm {{in the crook of}} the elbow, with the elbow against the chest), lowered to below the groin, and then thrust back up to the rack. The clean is often combined with <b>a</b> press or <b>jerk</b> to make <b>a</b> clean and press or <b>a</b> clean & <b>jerk</b> (also called <b>a</b> long <b>jerk).</b> The dead clean is a clean starting with the kettlebell on the floor.|$|R
500|$|By {{the end of}} July 1916, John Nichols and Robert Murphy {{were taking}} the great white more seriously. In Scientific American, Murphy wrote that the [...] "white shark is perhaps the rarest of all {{noteworthy}} sharks... their habits are little known, but {{they are said to}} feed to some extent on big sea turtles... Judging from its physical make-up, it would not hesitate to attack a man in open water." [...] He concluded that [...] "because it is evident that even a relatively small white shark, weighing two or three hundred pounds, might readily snap the largest human bones by <b>a</b> <b>jerk</b> of its body, after it has bitten through the flesh." ...|$|E
500|$|Chaiken also didn't want {{to portray}} Jenny's ordeal in an {{explicit}} manner, confirming this she said: [...] "I am loath to portray rape as a filmmaker. I {{think it is}} really hard {{to do it without}} somehow becoming complicit and exploitative. And so as much as it's important to talk about it, I wanted to be vague and not milk it." [...] Chaiken has also admitted that the use of dream sequences involving Jenny were not a successful inclusion, but claimed it was necessary to portray Jenny coming to terms with her abuse. Heather Hogan of AfterEllen criticized the storyline because there was no conclusion to it, also stating it was never explored enough, leading everyone to think she was just <b>a</b> <b>jerk.</b>|$|E
500|$|Popping {{is based}} on the {{technique}} of quickly contracting and relaxing muscles to cause <b>a</b> <b>jerk</b> in the dancer's body, referred to as a pop or a hit. Popping is also an inadvertent umbrella term that includes several other illusory dance styles such as ticking, liquid, tutting, waving, gliding, twisto-flex, and sliding. Most of these cannot be traced to a specific person or group and may have influences earlier than hip-hop. Earl [...] "Snake Hips" [...] Tucker was a professional dancer in the 1920s who appeared in the film Symphony in Black and performed at the Cotton Club in Harlem. Since hip-hop did not exist in the 1920s his style was considered jazz, but his [...] "slithering, writhing" [...] movement foreshadowed waving and sliding.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were as positive, however. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C+" [...] and highly criticized the {{characterization}} of Michael. Largely, he felt that Michael's antics made him out to be <b>a</b> <b>jerk</b> because the series has not worked at showing that he truly [...] "isn’t a complete asshole". Adams noted that Michael [...] "could truly force Darryl and his staff to work on Saturdays, and he truly could fire them for winning the basketball game. But {{that would be an}} outrageous abuse of legitimate power, which isn’t funny." [...] Ultimately he argued that the basketball scenes went on for too long; he said the [...] "episode’s original cut ran too long to air, and it’s obvious where the basketball scenes boxed out other threads of the episode".|$|E
500|$|Mike Scully {{wanted to}} do an episode where the {{children}} of Springfield {{would be subject to}} a curfew. He {{came up with the idea}} to do a Kids vs. Adults episode, where the children would be blamed for something the adults have done. The name of the baseball announcer, Denis Conroy, was used because that is the name of writer Larry Doyle's uncle. Dan Castellaneta ad libbed Homer singing [...] "Hitler is <b>a</b> <b>jerk,</b> Mussolini...." [...] It was added in to the episode only for the purpose of filling time. The Chief Wiggum billboard sketch was inspired by Beaver Cleaver getting stuck in a soup bowl billboard during the [...] "In the Soup" [...] episode of Leave It to Beaver. The music playing when the kids secretly leave their houses to see the movie was written by composer Alf Clausen.|$|E
500|$|... "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!" [...] was {{released}} on a DVD compilation {{of the same name}} on October 30, 2012 in Canada and on November 6, 2012 in the United States. The DVD features exclusive content including behind-the-scenes making of the special and interviews with the cast and crew, a pre-color animatic, and yule log. The initial announcement of the DVD release stated that it would contain three Christmas specials from T.U.F.F. Puppy, Fanboy & Chum Chum, and The Fairly OddParents as bonus features; however, these were dropped from the actual release. A Blu-ray release was also announced, but was cancelled a week afterwards for unknown reasons; however, on July 22, 2013, Paramount Home Media Distribution announced that the Blu-ray would be released on October 15, 2013.

50|$|Popping is {{centered}} around the technique of popping, which means to quickly contract and relax muscles to create <b>a</b> <b>jerking</b> effect (<b>a</b> pop or hit) in the body.

Stronger pops normally involve popping both the lower and upper body simultaneously.|$|R
