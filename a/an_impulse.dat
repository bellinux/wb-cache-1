5|$|Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun (The Three Leaps of Wang Lun) was Döblin's third novel (although it was {{the first}} to be {{published}} as a book), and garnered him the Fontane Prize. Published in 1916, (although back-dated to 1915), this epic historical novel narrates upheaval and revolution in 18th-century China, and was favorably received by critics, who praised its detailed and exotic depictions of China. Wang Lun also had an influence on younger German writers, including Lion Feuchtwanger, Anna Seghers, and Bertolt Brecht; for the latter, Wang Lun provided <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> {{for the development of the}} theory of epic theatre. In commercial sales, it is Döblin's most successful novel after Berlin Alexanderplatz.|$|E
5|$|CMAPs show small amplitudes but normal latency and {{conduction}} velocities. If repeated impulses {{are administered}} (2 per second or 2Hz), it is normal for CMAP amplitudes to become smaller as the acetylcholine in the {{motor end plate}} is depleted. In LEMS, this decrease is larger than observed normally. Eventually, stored acetylcholine is made available, and the amplitudes increase again. In LEMS, this remains insufficient to reach a level sufficient for transmission of <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> from nerve to muscle; all {{can be attributed to}} insufficient calcium in the nerve terminal. A similar pattern is witnessed in myasthenia gravis. In LEMS, in response to exercising the muscle, the CMAP amplitude increases greatly (over 200%, often much more). This also occurs on the administration of a rapid burst of electrical stimuli (20 impulses per second for 10 seconds). This is attributed to the influx of calcium in response to these stimuli. On single-fiber examination, features may include increased jitter (seen in other diseases of neuromuscular transmission) and blocking.|$|E
5|$|Once there, {{they are}} {{introduced}} to and begin {{to stay at the}} guesthouse of Kodandaram, an avid hunter, the neighbor and friend of Diganth's grandfather. Kodandaram, now handicapped from a hunting accident and confined to a wheelchair, lives with his wife Padma, daughter-in-law Sowmya, and daughters Radha and Pavani. Sowmya is widowed and teaches the village children; Radha, a student of Ayurveda, practices it alongside looking over the family's farming land; and Pavani is a student doing her pre-university course. Ganesh, a foodie, is fascinated with learning of Kodandaram's hunting spoils and persuades him to join them in hunting the very wild boar that left his legs crippled two years ago. At the forest, Kodandaram accidentally shoots Diganth in the chest, but is saved by a gong he had worn around his neck. They embark on another and final venture to kill the boar. As the boar approaches a rifle-wielding and wheelchair-bound Kodandaram, he gets up on his feet as <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> and refuses to shoot it, thankful for bringing him back to his feet again, and calls it an incarnation of varaha.|$|E

30|$|A sudden enhancement/drop {{in solar}} wind dynamic {{pressure}} causes the sudden compression/expansion of the magnetosphere, forming <b>a</b> positive/negative sudden <b>impulse</b> (SI) in the geomagnetic field (Nishida and Jacobs 1962). The signatures of these impulses {{in the ground}} magnetic field are quite complex due to the contributions from several current systems flowing in the magnetosphere and ionosphere. Using rapid-run magnetograms, {{it has been observed}} that the geomagnetic response signature of an SI is preceded by an initial rapid variation. The broad features of the geomagnetic signature include a first rapid response, also known as <b>a</b> preliminary <b>impulse</b> (PI) with <b>a</b> time scale of a few seconds to a few minutes, followed by <b>a</b> main <b>impulse</b> (MI). Araki (1977) described the geomagnetic signature of SIs in terms of <b>a</b> preliminary <b>impulse</b> of polar origin (DPpi), <b>a</b> main <b>impulse</b> dominating at low latitude (DLmi), and <b>a</b> main <b>impulse</b> of polar origin (DPmi). The PI is further categorized into positive and negative PIs. If the PI is negative (positive) during enhanced (reduced) solar dynamic pressure, then it is known as <b>a</b> preliminary reversed <b>impulse</b> (PRI). The DL field is a stepwise change in the geomagnetic field, and the DP field is a bipolar type. In this paper, we define the MI of a negative SI as the maximum reduction in the total field containing DPpi, DLmi, and DPmi parts.|$|R
25|$|When in space, {{the purpose}} of a {{propulsion}} system is to change the velocity, or v, of a spacecraft. Because this is more difficult for more massive spacecraft, designers generally discuss momentum, mv. The amount of change in momentum is called impulse. So the goal of a propulsion method in space is to create <b>an</b> <b>impulse.</b>|$|E
25|$|Automaticity is {{a measure}} of the {{propensity}} of a fiber to initiate <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> spontaneously. The product of a hypoxic myocardium can be hyperirritable myocardial cells. These may then act as pacemakers. The ventricles are then being stimulated by more than one pacemaker. Scar and dying tissue is inexcitable, but around these areas usually lies a penumbra of hypoxic tissue that is excitable. Ventricular excitability may generate re-entry ventricular arrhythmia.|$|E

25|$|Vertical {{harmonic}} motion results, producing <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> that travels {{the length of}} the basin at a velocity that depends on the depth of the water. The impulse is reflected back {{from the end of the}} basin, generating interference. Repeated reflections produce standing waves with one or more nodes, or points, that experience no vertical motion. The frequency of the oscillation is determined by the size of the basin, its depth and contours, and the water temperature.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} it spread was no faster than {{the spread of the}} Neolithic in general. Accordingly, Dolukhanov and others {{postulate}} that <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> from the steppe to the southeast of the barrier stimulated the Mesolithics north of it to innovate their own pottery. This view only accounts for the pottery; presumably, the Mesolithics combined it de novo with local food production, which began to spread very rapidly throughout a range that was already producing some food.|$|E

25|$|Also other {{solutions}} {{have been}} proposed, for instance, Valery Morozov (2011) gave consideration to movement of an imponderable charged sphere.

This flux has <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> exactly equal to 1/3 of the sphere electromagnetic impulse regardless of a sphere internal structure or a material, it is made of. The problem was solved without attraction of any additional hypotheses. In this model, sphere tensions are not connected with its mass.|$|E
25|$|Mathematical PID loop tuning induces <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> in the system, {{and then}} uses the {{controlled}} system's frequency response {{to design the}} PID loop values. In loops with response times of several minutes, mathematical loop tuning is recommended, because trial and error can take days just to find a stable set of loop values. Optimal values are harder to find. Some digital loop controllers offer a self-tuning feature in which very small setpoint changes are sent to the process, allowing the controller itself to calculate optimal tuning values.|$|E
25|$|Frequency {{multiplication}} {{can also}} be attained by locking the VCO output to the Nth harmonic of the reference signal. Instead of a simple phase detector, the design uses a harmonic mixer (sampling mixer). The harmonic mixer turns the reference signal into <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> train that is rich in harmonics. The VCO output is coarse tuned {{to be close to}} one of those harmonics. Consequently, the desired harmonic mixer output (representing the difference between the N harmonic and the VCO output) falls within the loop filter passband.|$|E

25|$|A small radial impulse {{given to}} a body in orbit changes the eccentricity, but not the orbital period (to first order). A {{prograde}} or retrograde impulse (i.e. <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> applied along the orbital motion) changes both the eccentricity and the orbital period. Notably, a prograde impulse at periapsis raises the altitude at apoapsis, and vice versa, and a retrograde impulse does the opposite. A transverse impulse (out of the orbital plane) causes rotation of the orbital plane without changing the period or eccentricity. In all instances, a closed orbit will still intersect the perturbation point.|$|E
25|$|For this system, when Q> (i.e., {{when the}} system is underdamped), it has two complex {{conjugate}} poles that each have a real part of −α. That is, the attenuation parameter α represents the rate of exponential decay of the oscillations (that is, of the output after <b>an</b> <b>impulse)</b> into the system. A higher quality factor implies a lower attenuation rate, and so high-Q systems oscillate for many cycles. For example, high-quality bells have an approximately pure sinusoidal tone {{for a long time}} after being struck by a hammer.|$|E
25|$|The {{output of}} a magneto {{depends on the}} speed of the engine, and {{therefore}} starting can be problematic. Some magnetos include <b>an</b> <b>impulse</b> system, which spins the magnet quickly at the proper moment, making easier starting at slow cranking speeds. Some engines, such as aircraft but also the Ford Model T, used a system which relied on non rechargeable dry cells, (similar to a large flashlight battery, and which was not maintained by a charging system as on modern automobiles) to start the engine or for starting and running at low speed. The operator would manually switch the ignition over to magneto operation for high speed operation.|$|E

50|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century and early twentieth century, {{monomania}} appears in treatises on criminal law: Monomania is a state of madness, or derangement of the mind, with respect to one subject only.
