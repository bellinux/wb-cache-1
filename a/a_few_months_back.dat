60|$|Wingrave {{eyed him}} more closely. Aynesworth had {{certainly}} fallen {{away from the}} trim and carefully turned out young man of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back.</b> He was paler, too, and looked older.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Sam Hicks; he {{only came}} back from California <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back,</b> so {{you would not be}} likely to have met him before. Were they going to remain where you left them?" ...|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as he}} {{was well}} enough to talk without fatigue, Martin {{consulted}} him upon a project he had in his mind, and which <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back</b> he would have carried into execution without troubling anybody's head but his own.|$|E
50|$|In the European election, 2004 the {{coalition}} gained 0.76% and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> later merged <b>back</b> into the Coalition of the Radical Left.|$|R
50|$|He {{started his}} career at junior side Dalry Thistle and joined Hamilton Academical in 1957 but after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> he moved <b>back</b> to Dalry.|$|R
6000|$|It {{happened}} after I {{had been in}} America for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months.</b> I got <b>back</b> to the flat latish one night, and when Jeeves brought me the final drink he said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You {{have been}} misinformed,' she said, a little primly. 'I {{do not say}} that <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back</b> I {{might not have been}} willing to have entertained such an offer, but my {{circumstances}} have changed since then, and now I should not think for a moment of doing so.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; he outspanned {{alongside}} of me for {{a fortnight}} to rest his oxen before going on to the interior. I had {{a letter from a}} lawyer <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back,</b> asking me if I knew what had become of him, which I answered {{to the best of my}} ability at the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|The door is flung open, and the red-faced Campaigner appears. Her face is mottled with wrath, her bandeaux of hair are disarranged {{upon her}} forehead, the {{ornaments}} of her cap, cheap, and dirty, and numerous, only {{give her a}} wilder appearance. She is in a large and dingy wrapper, {{very different from the}} lady who had presented herself <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back</b> to my wife--how different from the smiling Mrs. Mackenzie of old days! ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the next}} season, Atar moved to Hapoel Petah Tikva {{for a single}} season, before moving back to Hapoel Haifa and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> later <b>back</b> to Beitar Jerusalem, where {{he became one of}} the most popular players. In 2000, he {{returned}} to Maccabi Haifa, winning two championships. Atar left Haifa for Maccabi Netanya before the 2002/03 season, the last team in his professional career as a player.|$|R
5000|$|In 1898, Yuxian became Shandong {{lieutenant}} governor (buzengshi [...] ), the second-highest-ranked {{official in the}} province. After serving in Hunan and Jiangsu provinces for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> he came <b>back</b> to Shandong in March 1899 to serve as provincial governor.|$|R
50|$|Before {{striking}} a record deal with Jugoton, Zekerijah {{worked as a}} hotel singer in Tuzla, Bijeljina and Zagreb. He relocated to Sarajevo in 1959, singing in hotels for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> before moving <b>back</b> to Tuzla in March 1960 and signing with Radio Tuzla.|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate, he was {{the only}} {{prisoner}} who went with him. The rest of us remained there till <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back,</b> when the fort was abandoned. It was just after the capture of Bangalore, and the place could have offered no resistance, if a body of troops had been sent against it. At any rate, an order arrived one morning, and a few hours afterwards the place was entirely abandoned, and we and the garrison marched here." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back,</b> {{and such}} a {{spectacle}} would have called forth all the latent passion of Alroy; but time and suffering, and sharp experience, had already somewhat curbed the fiery spirit of the Hebrew Prince. He gazed upon Jerusalem, he beheld the City of David garrisoned by the puissant warriors of Christendom, and threatened by the innumerable armies of the Crescent. The two great divisions of the world seemed contending for a prize, which he, a lonely wanderer, had crossed the desert to rescue.|$|E
60|$|How the aspirations, and instincts, and {{feelings}} of a household become changed as the young birds begin to flutter with feathered wings, and have half-formed thoughts of leaving the parental nest! <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back,</b> Frank had reigned almost autocratic over the lesser subjects {{of the kingdom of}} Greshamsbury. The servants, for instance, always obeyed him, and his sisters never dreamed of telling anything which he directed should not be told. All his mischief, all his troubles, and all his loves were confided to them, with the sure conviction that they would never be made to stand in evidence against him.|$|E
50|$|Harriman {{started his}} career as a clerk in Omaha, Nebraska for Union Pacific Railroad. Even though his family were {{majority}} shareholders, Harriman wanted to start at the bottom and work his way up. However, he quit after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> and moved <b>back</b> to New York.|$|R
50|$|In 1986 Cennamo {{suffered}} a stroke. After {{an absence of}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> he was <b>back</b> on the air (WBUR) for another eleven years, with his son James producing and engineering. Tony helped a lot of Boston Jazz musicians, always ready to offer them support and airplay.|$|R
5000|$|After only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> he went <b>back</b> to Turin. In 1897, {{he created}} a series of portraits and nudes, {{including}} the [...] "Lucrezia Romana", {{which was the first}} popular Bulgarian painting in that genre. He graduated from the Academy with honors and was awarded a gold medal.|$|R
60|$|Laura had netted a purse {{into which}} {{his mother had}} put some sovereigns, and Pen had found it on his dressing-table that very morning. He gave one to the little servant who {{had been used to}} wait upon the Costigans, and another to the children, because they said they were very fond of her. It was but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back,</b> yet what years ago it seemed since he had first entered that room! He felt that it was all done. The very missing her at the coach had {{something}} fatal in it. Blank, weary, utterly wretched and lonely the poor lad felt.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{not more}} than that," [...] the man said; [...] "but age don't go for much here, and Colonel Washington is {{adjutant}} general of the Virginian militia. Only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back,</b> he made a journey with despatches, right through the forests to the French station at Port de Beuf, and, since then, {{he has been in}} command of the party which went out to build a fort, at the forks of the Ohio, and had some sharp fighting with the French. A wonderful smart young officer they say he is, just as cool, when the bullets are flying, as if sitting on horseback." ...|$|E
60|$|Scarcely {{anything}} can be imagined more miserable than {{the condition of the}} army, or more terrible than the situation of the young general, who felt himself responsible for its safety, and was compelled daily to see its sufferings and find his plans thwarted by the obstinacy and folly of the other officers, crushed by an overwhelming force, knowing that there was no quarter from which help could come, yet still struggling on in fulfillment of his sad duty. The hopes and expectations which had filled his heart <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back</b> had long passed away; nothing was around him but misery, nothing before him but desolation; but still he never failed in courage, in mildness, in confidence in Heaven.|$|E
60|$|EILEEN (hastening {{to comfort}} him). You mustn't worry, Fred. Please don't! It'd {{make it so}} much worse for me if I thought you did. I'll be all right. I'll do exactly what they tell me, and in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> I'll be <b>back</b> so fat and healthy you won't know me.|$|R
50|$|Although {{his life}} in Argentina was successful, he always pined for his {{hometown}} and country. His dream came true in January 1989, when he travelled to Slovenia with 107 works of art, all of which he donated to his motherland, just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> before dying <b>back</b> in Argentina, on 21 June 1989.|$|R
50|$|Born in Logroño, La Rioja, Rodríguez {{made his}} {{professional}} debuts with UE Lleida, {{playing with the}} Catalans in both {{the second and third}} divisions. In the 2006-07 season, he switched to Cádiz CF in the former level but, unsettled, left after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> and moved <b>back</b> to Lleida on loan, in the third category.|$|R
60|$|But the campaign, if {{not very}} glorious, was very pleasant. New sights of nature, by sea and land--a life of action, {{beginning}} {{now for the}} first time--occupied and excited the young man. The many accidents, and the routine of shipboard--the military duty--the new acquaintances, both of his comrades in arms, and of the officers of the fleet--served to cheer and occupy his mind, and waken it out of that selfish depression into which his late unhappy fortunes had plunged him. He felt as if the ocean separated him from his past care, and welcomed the new era of life which was dawning for him. Wounds heal rapidly in a heart of two-and-twenty; hopes revive daily; and courage rallies in spite of a man. Perhaps, as Esmond thought of his late despondency and melancholy, and how irremediable it had seemed to him, as he lay in his prison <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back,</b> he was almost mortified in his secret mind at finding himself so cheerful.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{were half}} a dozen fellows in the regiment--I was one of them--who ventured to think for themselves. We had secret meetings, and were in {{communication}} with men of other regiments. Well, I was sent off before anything came of it. But they got hold {{of the names of}} the others when they arrested some Nihilists at Kieff, and they were all sent out here for life. I met one of them <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back,</b> and he told me so. So you see it was rather lucky that I knocked down the colonel when I did. Besides, it is ever so much better to be a convict than a political. I don't know how it was you had the luck to get turned in with us. I can tell you there is no comparison between their lot and ours. Still it is hateful, of course, living among such a gang as these fellows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may be sure we was {{surprised}} {{as well as}} pleased to hear all this, an' we pumped him, in course, a good deal, an' {{he told us that}} the mine was in the Andes somewheres, at a place called Murrykeety Valley, or some such name. This Conrad had discovered the mine a good while ago, and had got an old trapper an' a boy to work it, but never made much of it till <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back,</b> when the old man an' the boy came suddenly on some rich ground, where the silver was shovelled up in buckets. In course I don't rightly know what like silver is when first got hold on. It ain't in ready-made dollars, I dare say, but anyhow, they say this Conrad'll be as rich as a nabob; an' he's got a pretty darter too, as has bin lost the most of her life, and just turned {{up at the same time}} wi' the silver. I don't rightly know if they dug her up in the mine, but there she is, an' she's goin' up to the mountains too, so young Ansty will be in good company." ...|$|E
50|$|Dedee ends up {{serving time}} in prison, leaving {{her son in}} Bill's care while she's incarcerated. After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> she moves <b>back</b> in with Bill, while Matt goes traveling, and Lucia gives birth to her own child. Eventually, Dedee decides that her son {{would be better off}} with Bill, who is now dating Dedee's parole officer, and runs away.|$|R
5000|$|Conventional therapy at {{that time}} did not help Luigi much. To regain control of his body, he started to {{experiment}} and design his own stretches. After nine months of self therapy, he returned to Falcon Studios where he trained daily. In 1948, Luigi was hired by Horace Heidt, a popular pianist and big band leader, to choreograph for his [...] "Bandwagon" [...] tour. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> later, <b>back</b> in Los Angeles, the three became housemates. It was then that Luigi, with Frontiere's help, coined “5, 6, 7, 8” as a lead-in for when to start dancing. He started to use the phrase around other dancers.|$|R
50|$|In 1889 the McKinley Tariff act raised {{tariffs on}} sugar {{exported}} to the U.S. market, and its price dropped to two cents a pound. Baldwin {{took advantage of}} the lower land prices and built an irrigation project on Kauai island called the Hanapepe ditch for the Hawaiian Sugar Company. He moved his family to Kauai for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> before moving <b>back</b> to Maui in 1893.|$|R
6000|$|Pen {{could hardly}} {{sleep at night}} in his bedroom at the Trencher: so anxious was he to begin his college life, and to get into his own apartments. What did he think about, as he lay tossing and awake? Was it about his mother at home; the pious soul whose life was bound up in his? Yes, let us hope {{he thought of her}} a little. Was it about Miss Fotheringay, and his eternal passion, which had kept him awake so many nights, and created such wretchedness and such longing? He had a trick of blushing, and if you had been in the room, and the candle had not been out, you might have seen the youth's countenance redden more than once, as he broke out into passionate {{incoherent}} exclamations regarding that luckless event of his life. His uncle's lessons had not been thrown away upon him; the mist of passion had passed from his eyes now, and he saw her as she was. To think that he, Pendennis, had been enslaved by such a woman, and then jilted by her! that he should have stooped so low, to be trampled on the mire! that there was a time in his life, and that but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back,</b> when he was willing to take Costigan for his father-in-law! ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few days}} after the famous presentation, another great and {{exceeding}} honour was vouchsafed to the virtuous Becky. Lady Steyne's carriage drove up to Mr. Rawdon Crawley's door, and the footman, instead of driving down the front of the house, as by his tremendous knocking he appeared to be inclined to do, relented and only delivered in a couple of cards, on which were engraven the names of the Marchioness of Steyne and the Countess of Gaunt. If these bits of pasteboard had been beautiful pictures, or had had a hundred yards of Malines lace rolled round them, worth twice the number of guineas, Becky could not have regarded them with more pleasure. You may be sure they occupied a conspicuous place in the china bowl on the drawing-room table, where Becky kept the cards of her visitors. Lord! lord! how poor Mrs. Washington White's card and Lady Crackenbury's card--which our little friend had been glad enough to get <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back,</b> and of which the silly little creature was rather proud once--Lord! lord! I say, how soon at the appearance of these grand court cards, did those poor little neglected deuces sink {{down to the bottom of}} the pack. Steyne! Bareacres, Johnes of Helvellyn! and Caerylon of Camelot! we may be sure that Becky and Briggs looked out those august names in the Peerage, and followed the noble races up through all the ramifications of the family tree.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had gone}} back at once to his mines, in some hopes that the threats might yet prove nothing but blustering; but he had {{scarcely}} arrived there when an Indian muleteer, to whom he had shown some kindness, brought him intelligence that la justida was in quest of him, but in difficulties how to get up the mountains. The poor Indians guided his escape, conducting him down wonderful paths only known to themselves, hiding him in strange sequestered huts, and finally guiding him safely to Callao, where he had secretly embarked on board an American vessel bound for Panama. Louis asked why he had fled, instead of taking his trial, and confuting Robson; but he smiled, and said, my Lord knew little of foreign justice; besides, Ford was ready to bear any witness that Robson might put into his mouth;--and his face grew dark. Who was this Ford? He could not tell; Mr. Robson had picked him up <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>back,</b> {{when there was a}} want of a clerk; like loved like, he supposed, but it was no concern of his. Would it be safe for him to venture back to Peru, under Fitzjocelyn's protection, and assist him in unmasking the treacherous Robson! To this he readily agreed, catching at the hope of establishing his innocence; but declaring that he should then go at once to the States.--'What, not even go home to see Charlotte? I've got a letter for you, when I can get at it.' ...|$|E
5000|$|After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> {{she came}} <b>back</b> with the drama series [...] "You Will Love Me". A {{lot of people}} {{believed}} that Lee Tae-Im was the sole reason for the fight, but the media and people welcomed her with a warm heart. Also, Kim Ye-Won apologized to Lee Tae-im and told the media how she felt after the incident and about her relationship with Lee Tae-Im.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1995, Redman visited Tennessee and Auburn before {{deciding}} to follow Schnellenberg to Oklahoma, giving another verbal commitment. [...] That commitment lasted only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> as Redman <b>backed</b> out based on concerns about the depth chart and distance from home. [...] In the summer of 1995, Redman signed a letter of intent to play college football at Louisville, his original choice, under new head coach Ron Cooper.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{his career}} as a strongman competitor, Girard worked as a bouncer in a popular Quebec City nightclub on {{weekends}} while attending community college. In the early 1990s, he went to Los Angeles in order to either pursue a career as a professional bodybuilder or as an actor. After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> Girard came <b>back</b> to the province of Quebec where he was later hired as a police officer for the city of Gatineau.|$|R
