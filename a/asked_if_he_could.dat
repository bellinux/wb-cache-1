5|$|After the diagnosis, Ryan White was too ill {{to return}} to school, but by early 1985 {{he began to feel}} better. His mother <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> return to school, but was told by school {{officials}} that he could not. On June 30, 1985, a formal request to permit re-admittance to school was denied by Western School Corporation superintendent James O. Smith, sparking an administrative appeal process that lasted for eight months.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Jamal Al-Durrah (born 1988) was {{in fifth}} grade, but his school was closed on 30 September 2000; the Palestinian Authority {{had called for}} a general strike and day of {{mourning}} following violence in Jerusalem the day before. His mother {{said he had been}} watching the rioting on television and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> join in. Father and son decided instead to go to a car auction. Jamal had just sold his 1974 Fiat, Motro wrote, and Muhammad loved cars, so they went to the auction together.|$|E
5|$|Newt Lee, {{the night}} watchman, arrived at work shortly before 4:00 and Frank, who was {{normally}} calm, came bustling {{out of his}} office. Frank told Lee {{that he had not}} yet finished his own work and asked Lee to return at 6:00. Newt Lee noticed that Frank was very agitated and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> sleep in the packing room, but Frank was insistent that Lee leave the building and told Lee to go out {{and have a good time}} in town before coming back.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after {{negotiations}} with the union ended, the mine owners met secretly with Sheriff Bowers in Colorado Springs. They told Bowers they intended to bring in hundreds of nonunion workers, and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> protect such a large force of men. Bowers said he could not, for the county lacked the financial resources to pay and arm {{more than a few}} deputies. The mine owners offered to subsidize an initial force of a hundred or so men. Bowers agreed, and immediately began recruiting ex-police and ex-firefighters from Denver.|$|E
5|$|Surjik {{personally}} <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{direct the}} episode {{because he was}} a fan of the series; this was his only credit for the series. Filming the episode was difficult for the cast and crew due largely {{to the fact that the}} script arrived for the cast and crew to film only two days in advance. Other issues arose because of technical reasons; one scene required flooding a hallway with 3,300 gallons of water. Many of the scenes were filmed at Riverview Hospital, a mental health facility located in Coquitlam, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Elvis Presley as Vince Everett, a {{prisoner}} who, after being released, becomes a star for his singing talent. Producer Pandro S. Berman's wife {{convinced him to}} make a film with Presley starring in the leading role. Berman contacted Presley's manager, Colonel Thomas Parker, and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> send Presley or Parker the script to read it. Parker was uninterested and denied the request. Berman asked Parker under which conditions would he take the project, to which Parker replied that he was only interested in the music score of the movie and owning the rights for record sales and publishing royalties. Presley's payment was settled at 250,000 and 50% of the royalties from the distribution of the movie.|$|E
50|$|The episode {{ends with}} Hawkeye {{on the phone}} talking to his father, casually {{explaining}} how he's still dead {{as far as the}} Army is concerned and <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be sent his allowance again.|$|R

5|$|George Holdcroft {{composed}} the score for The FP. He {{was invited to}} a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate {{the sound of a}} choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another song, he sang in falsetto and altered the pitch of his voice to make himself sound like a woman.|$|E
5|$|In February 1943, Lieutenant General Walter Krueger's Sixth United States Army {{headquarters}} {{arrived in}} Australia. Since Sixth Army would {{do all the}} planning, and there was as yet little scope for corps-sized operations, Eichelberger found himself with a training role, preparing the 24th Infantry Division, which had arrived from Hawaii, and the 32nd and 41st Infantry Divisions, which had returned from Papua, for future missions. The War Department asked in May 1943 if Eichelberger could be released to command the First United States Army, but MacArthur would not release him. Later, it <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be released to command the Ninth United States Army, but this was also refused, and this job went to Eichelberger's West Point classmate William H. Simpson. Instead, he was given responsibility for Eleanor Roosevelt's visit to Australia in September 1943. She visited Sydney and Melbourne, and had dinner with the Governor General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, and the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin, in Canberra.|$|E
5|$|When Skerritt {{first read}} the {{screenplay}} for Alien, he declined the project, unimpressed with its writing quality and budget. After the screenplay was edited {{and the budget}} enlarged, Skerritt was approached again and signed on. Halfway through production, he approached writer and executive producer Ronald Shusett and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> trade his salary for a one-half percentage point (.5 percent) share in the film. In a deleted scene, Ellen Ripley detours while escaping from the Nostromo and finds Dallas alive in the Alien nest; she kills Dallas and destroys the nest with a flamethrower {{in an act of}} mercy. According to Skerritt, the scene was cut because its quality was below par and it disrupted the pace of Ripley's escape; it was included in the 2003 director's cut.|$|E
6000|$|... “And I am Diogenes the Cynic,” was the answer, {{in a tone}} as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> thought himself {{quite as}} good as the king. Alexander, however, talked much with him, and ended by <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do {{anything}} for him.|$|R
5000|$|... "Umbrella Sharing": Red and Brown {{are sitting}} under a rock {{on a sunny}} day, until some storm clouds appear and a {{lightning}} strike frightens them. They look up and they could see a drop appear. It is raining. Brown covers himself with a small rock, while Red hides under a large rock. Brown throws away the small rock, and pulls out an umbrella, which surprises Red. Red <b>asks</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> cover himself with something. Brown walks away, until Red squirts {{his face with a}} hose, and then rubs his eyes and <b>asks</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> share the umbrella with Brown, and Brown says yes. All cavemen are happy while sharing the umbrella.|$|R

5|$|Having {{lived in}} Queensland {{most of his}} life, Irwin was also a fan of rugby league. As a teenager, he played for the Caloundra Sharks as a second-rower, and as an adult {{he was known to}} be a passionate Brisbane Broncos fan and was {{involved}} with the club on several occasions. On one occasion after turning up to training he <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> tackle the largest player, Shane Webcke. Despite being thrown to the ground and looking like he'd been crushed he was jovial about the experience. Irwin laughingly shared the experience with the Queensland State of Origin squad before the 2006 series. Irwin also supported rugby union, being a fan of the national team, the Wallabies. He once wore a Wallaby jersey during a demonstration at the zoo. A behind-the-scenes episode of The Crocodile Hunter showed Irwin and the crew finding a petrol station in a remote part of Namibia to watch the Wallabies defeat France in the 1999 Rugby World Cup Final. Irwin was also a talented surfer.|$|E
5|$|Warren Davis, a {{programmer}} hired {{to work on}} the action game Protector, noticed Lee's ideas, and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> use them to practice programming randomness and gravity as game mechanic. Thus, he added balls that bounced from the pyramid's top to bottom. Because Davis was still learning how to program game mechanics, he wanted to keep the design simple. He also felt games with complex control schemes were frustrating and wanted something that could be played with one hand. To accomplish this, Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective to saving the protagonist from danger. As Davis worked on the game one night, Gottlieb's vice president of engineering, Ron Waxman, noticed him and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game's character has landed on them. Davis implemented a unique control scheme; a four-way joystick was rotated 45° to match the directions of Q*bert's jumping. Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation, but Davis stuck to his decision. Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982, but the project was only put on schedule as an actual product several months later.|$|E
5|$|At about 5 a.m., Parsons {{stopped at}} a Texaco service station 23 miles to the north. He was wearing Ernest's clothes and had assumed his identity. Parsons told the station {{attendant}} he needed to hose out red construction paint from the car's interior and offered to give him Ernest's construction tools. The attendant said that he observed Parsons throwing away clothing, books, posters and carpentry tools into a dumpster. Parsons asked the attendant about the distance to Denver and spoke of Ernest's 9-year-old son as his own. He purchased cigarettes and food with Ernest's MasterCard credit card before leaving. At 7:23 a.m., Parsons used the credit card to check into a Quality Inn at Richfield, Utah. He used the card again at about 10 a.m. to purchase seat covers and floor mats from Kmart {{to cover up the}} blood stains in the car. A clerk called the Richfield Police Department after Parsons attempted to purchase $300 worth of items at 12:34 p.m. and the credit card was found to be over its limit. The attendant back at the Texaco station called the Beaver County Sheriff's Office after discovering bloody items in the dumpster. Deputy Raymond Goodwin found Ernest's bank statement and Parsons' bloody clothes in the dumpster. After calling Ernest's wife Beverley, the officers concluded that the person who visited the service station was not Richard Ernest. At about 4:25 p.m. on August 31, a Utah Highway Patrol officer found Parsons sleeping in Ernest's car at the Red Creek rest area on Interstate 70, west of Salina, Utah. When Parsons was brought into the Richfield police station where the bloody clothes were gathered, he continued to insist that he was Ernest. When officers asked for his street address, Parsons asked for a lawyer. Sheriff Kenneth Yardley recalled that Parsons <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> keep his book to read.|$|E

25|$|In late 1916, Zelle {{travelled}} to Madrid, {{where she}} met with the German military attaché, Major Arnold Kalle, and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> arrange {{a meeting with the}} Crown Prince. During this period, Zelle apparently offered to share French secrets with Germany in exchange for money, though whether this was because of greed or an attempt to set up a meeting with Crown Prince Wilhelm remains unclear.|$|E
60|$|Now, it happened, one day, {{that the}} king of the country was hunting in a wood close to the palace, and was {{overtaken}} by the dark. Seeing a light shining in the palace he sent one of his servants to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get a night's lodging there.|$|R
50|$|Phillips credits YouTube for {{starting}} his acting career. He was discovered on YouTube by a producer who enjoyed {{his work and}} later messaged him to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> star in a movie he was producing called Assault of the Sasquatch. Since then, Phillips has starred in over 100 movies.|$|R

25|$|In 1950, Horiuchi {{suffered}} a fall from a ladder {{in which he}} severely injured his left wrist, {{and was unable to}} work for several months. As the Horiuchis reached financial desperation, a family friend <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> try selling some of Paul's paintings. To Horiuchi's surprise, the friend quickly sold four of his works for a considerable amount of money. Horiuchi closed his auto repair shop and opened Tozai ("East-West") Art, an antique shop which also served as his studio and gallery, and as a meeting place for artists.|$|E
25|$|Mutemath {{started in}} 2002 {{as a long}} {{distance}} collaboration between Paul Meany in New Orleans, Louisiana and Darren King in Springfield, Missouri. The two {{had known each other}} from their work together in Meany's previous band Earthsuit. Occasionally Paul would receive instrumental demo CDs from Darren. Fairly impressed with his efforts, Paul contacted Darren and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> mess with the demos a bit, adding some ideas of his own. Darren obliged and the two would set in motion a sort of songwriting ping-pong match that would carry on for several months.|$|E
25|$|Another of Bob's friends, Vestine (who {{had been}} {{expelled}} from Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention for excessive drug use), <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> join {{the band and}} was accepted while keeping Edwards on temporarily. Soon Edwards departed (he went on to form the Stone Poneys with Linda Ronstadt) {{and at the same}} time Frank Cook came in to replace Holmes as their permanent drummer. Cook already had substantial professional experience, having performed with such jazz luminaries as bassist Charlie Haden, trumpeter Chet Baker, and pianist Elmo Hope and had also collaborated with black soul/pop artists such as Shirley Ellis and Dobie Gray.|$|E
