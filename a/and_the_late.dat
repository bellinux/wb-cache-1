5|$|Between then <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1940s {{these two}} {{estimates}} were commonly cited by reporters and the media.

5|$|The Green Revolution was {{a series}} of research, development, and {{technology}} transfer initiatives, between the 1940s <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1970s.

The initiatives, led by Norman Borlaug and credited with saving over a billion people from starvation, involved the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers.|$|E

5|$|A fee {{equivalent}} to €280,000 {{was enough to}} take him to the Ukrainian Premier League and Dynamo Kiev in January 1998, where he signed a four-year deal.

The Ukrainian club had been under the ownership of Hryhoriy Surkis <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> Valeriy Lobanovskyi had just been installed as manager; they would go on to win eight consecutive league titles. Kaladze also appeared in both legs of the semi-final of the 1998–99 Champions League against Bayern Munich, which Dynamo Kyiv lost 4–3 on aggregate.

5|$|Athens {{is home to}} {{the summer}} music festival Athfest, , the Athens Popfest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> spring Athens Human Rights Festival and North Georgia Folk Festival. The college radio station WUOG (90.5 FM), the {{low-power}} (100.7) FM WPPP-LP and the free weekly Flagpole are the city's most prominent modern music media. Athens has never produced a major local label like many similar indie rock towns; the most important label of the 1970s and 1980s was DB Records, based out of Atlanta, though jangle pop pioneers Kindercore Records and Wuxtry Records were also Athens-based.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the early}} 16th <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 17th centuries, an {{original}} tradition of stone tented roof architecture developed in Russia. It was quite unique and {{different from the}} contemporary Renaissance architecture elsewhere in Europe, though some research terms the style 'Russian Gothic' and compares it with the European Gothic architecture of the earlier period. The Italians, with their advanced technology, may have influenced {{the invention of the}} stone tented roof (the wooden tents were known in Russia and Europe long before). According to one hypothesis, an Italian architect called Petrok Maly may have been an author of the Ascension Church in Kolomenskoye, one of the earliest and most prominent tented roof churches.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s the South Florida {{metropolitan}} area grew {{four times as}} fast {{as the rest of the}} nation. Between 1940 and 1965, 6million people moved to south Florida: 1,000people moved to Miami every week. Urban development between the mid-1950s <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1960s quadrupled. Much of the water reclaimed from the Everglades was sent to newly developed areas. With metropolitan growth came urban problems associated with rapid expansion: traffic jams; school overcrowding; crime; overloaded sewage treatment plants; and, for the first time in south Florida's urban history, water shortages in times of drought.|$|E
5|$|During warmer weather, {{the wood}} turtle {{stays in the}} water for a larger {{percentage}} of the time. For this reason, during the winter months (<b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> fall and early spring) it is considered an aquatic turtle. November through February or March is spent in hibernation {{at the bottom of a}} small, flowing river. The wood turtle may hibernate alone or in large groups. During this period, individuals bury themselves in the thick mud at the bottom of the river and rarely move. During hibernation, it is vulnerable to flash floods. Emergence does not occur until March or sometimes April, months that mark the beginning of its activation period (males are typically more active than females at this time).|$|E
