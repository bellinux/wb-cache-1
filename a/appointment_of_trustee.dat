2500|$|The Trusts <b>of</b> Land and <b>Appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trustees</b> Act 1996 (...) , {{usually called}} [...] "TLATA", is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, which altered {{the law in}} {{relation}} to trusts of land in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.|$|R

50|$|The Act {{authorized}} the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>trustees,</b> who would oversee a guarantee against {{the expense of}} settling South Australia, purchased out of the funds raised as South Australian Colonial Revenue Securities. This guarantee could be either Exchequer bills or other government securities in England. The amount was specified as twenty thousand pounds.|$|R
50|$|In 1959 vandals {{destroyed}} {{a number of}} articles in the chapel which precipitated {{the formation of a}} committee and the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>trustees</b> from the R.S.S.A.I.L.A. and the 41st Division Association to preserve and maintain the chapel. The committee established an annual service held on the Sunday closest to 4 July, American Independence Day.|$|R
50|$|The power <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trustee</b> <b>of</b> a {{discretionary}} trust {{is held by}} the Appointor. In some trust deeds, the person holding the power <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trustee</b> is called the Custodian or the Principal of the trust. The Appointor is usually a natural person but {{can also be a}} company. Generally, upon the death of the Appointor, in the absence <b>of</b> an alternate <b>appointment</b> in the trust deed, the personal legal representative (executor) of the Appointor becomes the Appointor. The real power in relation to the control of the trust rests with the Appointor because of the ability to terminate the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trustee</b> and appoint a different trustee. This must be kept in mind when considering succession and estate planning involving assets held in a {{discretionary trust}}.|$|R
5000|$|The law {{relating}} to trusts of land was adjusted by the Trusts <b>of</b> Land and <b>Appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trustees</b> Act 1996 (TOLATA) which came into force in 1997. This {{had a significant}} impact, particularly in relation to bankruptcy and the associated importance of the family home - see [...] "Re Shaire" [...] 2001. There have also been discussions in relation to trusts of land and the Human Rights Act 1998.|$|R
5|$|Rules on the {{acquisition}} of land are covered in Part III of the Act. Until the passage <b>of</b> the Act, <b>trustees</b> {{had no right to}} purchase land with trust money, with two exceptions; first, if the trust instrument authorised or required the trustee to purchase land and second, Section 6(4) of the Trusts <b>of</b> Land and <b>Appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trustees</b> Act 1996, which allowed trustees to buy land either as an investment or for habitation by the beneficiaries.|$|R

[...] "But, indeed, {{the identity of the}} legacies given to some twenty or thirty persons, and of all the other provisions of the will, including the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>trustees</b> and guardians, with those of the will in our possession, would seem in itself to set the matter at rest. Were you present yourself when the General signed it?" ...|$|R

50|$|On 4 March 2016, a state {{administrator}} {{was appointed}} to run Zaman as well as Today's Zaman. It is widely believed that the Turkish government's <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>trustees</b> {{to a number of}} media organizations was an attempt to silence voices critical of the government. Since a series of corruption investigations went public on 17 December 2013 which targeted high ranking government officials, the Turkish government has been putting pressure on media organizations that are critical of it.|$|R
25|$|Cricket {{was first}} played in Australia in Sydney's Hyde Park in 1803. However, {{up until the}} <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>trustees</b> {{to look after the}} SCG in the late 1870s, several {{different}} grounds had been used. The Domain was first used for inter-colonial games and then the Albert Ground in Redfern but in time both became unavailable, the Domain because of its poor condition and because it could not be fenced in and the Albert Ground because it closed in the late 1870s.|$|R
50|$|The Chester {{district}} was abolished on 1 April 2009, {{when the new}} Cheshire West and Chester unitary authority was formed. Chester's city charter is retained through the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> charter <b>trustees.</b>|$|R

Under emergency decree No. 687 of February 9, 2017, Turkey’s Saving Deposit Insurance Fund (TMSF) will be authorized to sell companies seized by the state through the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>trustees.</b> Also, through the use of emergency decrees- such as Nos. 668  (July 27, 2016), 675 (October 29, 2016) and 677 (November 22, 2016), 178 media organizations were closed down being charged of having terrorist affiliations. As to November 2016, Twenty-four of these shut-down media organizations were radio stations, twenty- eight televisions, eighty newspapers.|$|R
50|$|Counsel for Mrs Sabherwal {{attacked}} {{the claim that}} the interest was overreached by arguing that the Trusts <b>of</b> Land and <b>Appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trustees</b> Act 1996 altered the common law precedent, and by arguing that his client’s human rights (specifically the right to respect for one’s home in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights) had been breached. Walker LJ found that neither the 1996 Act or the implementing 1998 Human Rights Act were in force at the material time, and furthermore even if they were neither would apply.|$|R
5000|$|This is the {{appropriate}} way of alerting a purchaser {{of the existence of}} an equitable family interest which arises under a trust of land. A restriction does not protect the priority of that interest, nor any right of occupation - it notifies the purchaser of the interest. In any event, in the normal case, the purchaser will overreach and in such cases it is immaterial whether the purchaser knows of the equitable family interest or not.

40|$|Outlines {{the factors}} {{which the court}} needs to {{consider}} when deciding whether to grant an application {{for the sale of}} a property where the owner becomes bankrupt. Considers the different priorities to be given to the claims <b>of</b> <b>trustees</b> in bankruptcy and to secure lenders, with reference to the Trusts <b>of</b> Land and <b>Appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trustees</b> Act 1996 ss. 14 and 15, the Insolvency Act 1986 s. 355 A, and the exceptional circumstances in which claims will not be granted.

40|$|Discusses {{the rights}} and {{responsibilities}} <b>of</b> <b>trustees</b> and beneficiaries <b>of</b> co-owned land under the Trusts <b>of</b> Land and <b>Appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trustees</b> Act 1996, in particular s. 14 which allows the court to make an order declaring the extent and nature of a person's interest in the property. Refers to the Court of Appeal decision in Avis v Turner on whether {{the existence of an}} earlier court order postponing the sale of matrimonial property following the owners' divorce meant that an application could not be brought by a trustee in bankruptcy under s. 14. Considers the "exceptional circumstances" which could allow the court to postpone the sale. [From Legal Journals Index...|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the outcry}} over the ballroom demolition, and the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> new <b>Trustees</b> {{and a new}} Chair in 1983, the {{heritage}} of the building began {{to be seen as}} important as providing modern space for exhibitions.|$|R
40|$|Construes the Trusts <b>of</b> Land and <b>Appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trustees</b> Act 1996 s. 6 (5) {{under which}} <b>trustees</b> <b>of</b> trusts of land are {{required}} to have regard {{to the rights of}} the beneficiaries when exercising the powers conferred on them under s. 6, proposing a construction of the subsection which requires it to be read as a counterpart to the provisions of s. 15. Considers the meaning to be attributed to the word "rights" in s. 6 (5). Explains the reasons for the proposed construction, applies it to an example scenario and identifies three advantages in adopting it...|$|R
40|$|Reflects {{on whether}} a {{rational}} foundation exists for the right of occupation granted to beneficiaries under a trust of land by the Trusts <b>of</b> Land and <b>Appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trustees</b> Act 1996. Reviews the historical background to the right, the advantages of its statutory basis and factors which suggest {{the absence of any}} underlying doctrinal cohesiveness, including the Act's failure to provide a definition of "unsuitable for occupation". Examines case law {{on the extent to which}} the right is underpinned by three conflicting principles of beneficiary autonomy, various aspects <b>of</b> <b>trustee</b> authoritarianism and settlor interposition. Compares the right to occupy the matrimonial home under the Family Law Act 1996 s. 30 and suggests possible options for reform...|$|R

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{the topic}} of integrity <b>of</b> the bankruptcy <b>trustee</b> is being dealt with from a Dutch perspective, more specifically {{from the point of}} view of the creditors and their (lack of) influence on the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trustee.</b> In this respect various questions are addressed: what does integrity or righteousness mean in the context <b>of</b> the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> a bankruptcy <b>trustee</b> and what do we mean when we are talking about a righteous trustee; why do we need a righteous trustee; and how do we reach our goal? After investigating the existing safeguards to prevent non-righteous persons to be enrolled or appointed as <b>trustee,</b> the position <b>of</b> the creditors is dealt with, especially with respect to their influence on the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trustee.</b> A quick glance on various neighbouring jurisdictions, demonstrates that not much has been regulated in the Netherlands. As to the question whether or not more creditor involvement in the appointment process is required or desired, it is argued that there is no need to increase their influence because it is not to be expected that such influence will enhance the integrity <b>of</b> bankruptcy <b>trustees...</b>|$|R
5|$|Attorney General Alfred S. Hartwell {{applied for}} the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>trustees</b> shortly after Kanaʻina's death under the {{articles}} of Lunalilo's will. Article three of that will bequeathed the entirety of his estate to three trustees appointed by the Justices of the Supreme Court of the Hawaiian Kingdom.

40|$|The Trusts <b>of</b> Land and <b>Appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trustees</b> Act 1996 has {{transformed}} the nature of co-ownership interests in land. The trust for sale, which governed dealings in co-owned property under the Law of Property Act 1925, and which made sale the presumptive object of co-ownership, {{has been replaced by}} a trust of land, under which co-owners retain an interest in the land itself, rather than its capital value. This article considers the likely impact of this legislative policy departure, particularly in relation to the court's willingness to grant an order for the sale of co-owned property on application by a creditor, and against the wishes of anon-debtor co-owner occupier...|$|R
