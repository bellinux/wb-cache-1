5|$|By {{the time}} of World War I, the easy-to-reach gold was {{exhausted}} and Fairbanks' population plunged as miners moved to promising finds at Ruby and Iditarod. Construction of the Alaska Railroad caused a surge of economic activity and allowed heavy equipment to be brought in for further exploitation of Fairbanks' gold deposits. Enormous gold dredges were built north of Fairbanks, and the city grew throughout the 1930s <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> gold rose during the Great Depression. A further boom came during the 1940s and 1950s as the city became a staging area for construction of military depots during World War II and {{the first decade of}} the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the French government's anger against Morocco was increasing. A {{series of}} {{incidents}} in October 1849 damaged relations between both countries; {{a series of}} assassinations directed at the French frontier had occurred, and the French Consul had requested the dismissal of Pacha Ouchda, who was believed to have caused these issues. From 1845 to 1851, Morocco had a serious agricultural crisis caused by a drought, resulting in crop failure. The people of Morocco were suffering <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> wheat and barley reached unprecedented heights. In Salé, many people were starving, and the agricultural crisis and anger towards France ultimately led to the bombardment of Salé.|$|E
5|$|Rupert's contemporaries {{believed}} {{him to have}} been involved in some of the bloodier events of the war, although later histories have largely exonerated him. Rupert had grown up surrounded by the relatively savage customs of the Thirty Years' War in Europe. Shortly after his arrival in England he caused consternation by following similar practices; one of his early acts was to demand two thousand pounds from the people of Leicester for the King <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> not sacking Leicester. Although in keeping with European practices, this was not yet considered appropriate behaviour in England and Rupert was reprimanded by the King.|$|E
5|$|A less violent side to Alexander's {{government}} {{is demonstrated by}} other evidence. Over a century after his time, his administrative decisions were still being cited as precedents. Some of these are known from a surviving edict issued on July 6, 68, {{less than a month}} after Nero's death. This denounces, and introduces measures against, a variety of abuses including inaccurate tax assessments, malicious prosecutions and the imprisonment of debtors by private creditors. The edict's only allusion to the chaotic political situation comes as a call for trust in the benevolence of the new Emperor, Galba, and his ability to put right the wrongs of the past. Alexander was making representations to Galba on behalf of the provincials, presumably representing the desired reforms <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> loyalty from this vital grain-producing province.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> silver rose, Treasury Department vaults were {{depleted}} of silver dollars by the public. No silver dollars had been minted in the United States since 1935, and a shortage {{developed in the}} Western United States, especially in areas in which gambling was common. As a result, Congress voted to authorize production of 45 million new silver Peace dollars on August 3, 1964. However, the move drew strong condemnation from critics who believed that the issuance of the coins was influenced by special interests, {{and that they would}} be quickly removed from circulation. The dollars were subsequently melted, and the Coinage Act of 1965, enacted on July 23, 1965, forbade all production of dollar coins for a period of five years.|$|E
5|$|Linderman {{ordered a}} review {{of the success of the}} trade dollar in China. It was {{discovered}} that the coins circulated reasonably well in southern China, but usage in the north was limited. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> silver decreased, employers in the United States began paying workers in trade dollars purchased at a discount. The situation frustrated the public, as the coins were widely disliked and many banks and businesses refused to accept them. In response, many towns, mostly in the western states, set a fixed value on trade dollars. Businesses which did accept trade dollars to avoid offending customers could not deposit them in banks or use them to pay taxes, and sold them to brokers. The brokers in turn recirculated the coins by selling them at a discount from face value to employers who included them in workers' pay packets. In 1883, members of the New York Mercantile Exchange petitioned Congress to allow redemption of the coins by the government.|$|E
5|$|With the Coinage Act of 1873, {{the dollar}} {{was no longer}} {{equivalent}} to a set amount of silver, a statutory change made so that <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> silver dropped with increased U.S. production, mining companies could not present their bullion at the mints and receive it back, struck into silver dollars worth more as money than they were as metal. By the post-World War II era, the Bureau of the Mint was striking the three remaining precious metal coins, the dime, quarter and half dollar in 90 percent silver—the dollar had not been coined since 1935 and circulated little outside some Western states like Nevada and Montana. The metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money above $1.2929 per troy ounce; the smaller coins would be attractive for the melting pot above $1.38 per ounce.|$|E

Per capita, the U.S. spends more on pharmaceuticals than any other country, although expenditures on pharmaceuticals accounts for a smaller share (13%) of total health care costs compared to an OECD average of 18% (2003 figures).

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the cotton {{industry}} was booming. The crop made up 69% of the agricultural business in the region. Livestock production was booming, as was poultry production, especially chicken. In addition, the shipping of agricultural goods and livestock was the other main business in Cooper. The First National Bank was rebuilt in 1909 and became an important factor in Cooper's economy. In the 1910s, potatoes become {{an important part of the}} economy due to the sudden drop in the livestock business. In 1926, the cotton crop failed and Cooper's economy plummeted. Many of Cooper's inhabitants became deep in debt <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> crops plummeted. The lumber businesses had exhausted the regions resources, forcing most of them to go out of business. Many people moved away to find new work. The local economy stabilized in the mid-1930s, and cotton, potato, and corn production began to rise. The growing of oats, however, had ended. In addition, the railroad going through Cooper had failed a few years before, so the shipping industry in Cooper was struggling. Cotton and alfalfa carried Cooper's economy through the 1950s and 1960s, until the shift to the growing of wheat in the 1970s. Cooper reported 60 businesses in the 1970s, more than half of which were dairies. During the 1980s and 1990s, Cooper's economy shifted to the manufacturing and shipping of local goods, and in 1991, Cooper had 70 businesses.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} what was then known as Scary Movie went on sale on a Friday in June1995, but {{received}} no bids. By the following Monday, the script had become {{the subject of a}} significant bidding war among a host of established studios, including Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and Morgan Creek Productions. Producer Cathy Konrad read the script and felt it was exactly what the Weinstein brothers of the fledgling Dimension Films — then a part of Miramax — were looking for. Dimension had previously released several horror films and intended to focus on that genre. Konrad brought the script to Bob Weinstein's assistant, Richard Potter. Believing it had potential, he brought it to Weinstein's attention. Studios began {{to drop out of the}} bidding <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> the script increased, and the final two bidders were Oliver Stone, who was at the time working under Cinergi Pictures, and the Weinsteins of Dimension Films. Williamson agreed to a bid of $400,000 from Miramax, plus a contract for two sequels and a possible fourth unrelated film. Williamson said he chose Dimension because he believed they would produce Scary Movie immediately and without significantly censoring the violence in the script. Craven read the script before he became involved in the production, and considered convincing a studio to buy it for him to direct. However, by the time Craven read the script, it had already been sold.|$|E
5|$|The station {{started to}} trial the {{co-firing}} of petcoke (petroleum coke) {{in one of}} its boilers in June 2005, ending in June 2007, burning 15% petcoke and 85% coal. Petcoke was burned to make the electricity more competitive <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> running the FGD equipment was making the electricity more expensive. The Environment Agency (EA) granted permission for the trial in June 2004, despite the plans being opposed by Friends of the Earth and Selby Council. To meet their concerns, emissions were constantly monitored through the trial, and they were not allowed to burn petcoke without operating the FGD plant to remove the high sulphur content of the emissions. The trial proved that there were no significant negative effects on the environment, and so in late 2007 Drax Group applied to move from trial conditions to commercial burn. The EA granted permission in early 2008 after agreeing with Drax's findings that the fuel had no significant negative effects on the environment. The station can now burn up to 300,000 tonnes of the fuel a year, and stock up to 6,000 tonnes on site.|$|E

50|$|In capitalism, Marx argues, {{commodity}} {{values are}} commercially expressed <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> production of commodities (cost-price + average profit). <b>Prices</b> <b>of</b> production are established jointly by average input costs {{and by the}} ruling profit margins applying to outputs sold.
