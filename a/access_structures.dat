In its original use in cryptography, the resource was a secret shared among the participants. Only subgroups of participants contained in the access structure, are able to join their shares to recompute the secret.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 In this {{dissertation}} {{we consider}} the problem of automating the design of <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> for relational database systems. The main considerations are effective and rigorous utilization of the users' usage patterns, global treatment of the whole design and utilizing most of the commonly known <b>access</b> <b>structures.</b> We represent the usage patterns on the <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> as relational algebra views. We transform a view into one or more simple <b>access</b> <b>structures.</b> Using the simple <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> we generate compound <b>access</b> <b>structures.</b> From this set of <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> we choose an approximately optimal set of <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> that process the input views as efficiently as possible and obey the storage space constraint. In developing the transformation methods, we also develop the concepts of aggregation and generalization for <b>access</b> <b>structures,</b> and use them in obtaining compound <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> from simple data items and in integrating several <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> into one access structure. We introduced a general method that shows how any complex access structure is formed from the simple data items using aggregation. In the transformations we consider insertion, deletion, look-up, update, building and storage space costs of <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> and/or views. The access structure types employed are tree, chain, circular chain, pointer array, cluster of tuples and sorting tuples {{in one or two}} relations. The <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> associated with a relation may cover different numbers of tuples. For the optimization we separate all <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> into pointer and placement types. We give a 0 - 1 knapsack problem based approximate optimization algorithm to solve the pointer access structure optimization problem. We formulate the placement access structure optimization as a 0 - 1 integer programming problem. In the global optimization algorithm, we utilize the placement and pointer optimization algorithms and approximately compensate for the interdependencies between the placement and pointer access structure optimizations...|$|E

Brickell and Davenport (J. of Cryptology, 1991) proved that ideal <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> are induced by matroids. Subsequently, ideal <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> and <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> induced by matroids have attracted {{a lot of}} attention. Due {{to the difficulty of}} finding general results, the characterization of ideal <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> has been studied for several particular families of <b>access</b> <b>structures.</b> In all these families, all the matroids that are related to <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> in the family are representable and, then, the matroid-related <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> coincide with the ideal ones. In this paper, we study the characterization of representable matroids. By using the well known connection between ideal secret sharing and matroids and, in particular, the recent results on ideal multipartite <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> and the connection between multipartite matroids and discrete polymatroids, we obtain a characterization of a family of representable multipartite matroids, which implies a sufficient condition for an access structure to be ideal. By using this result and further introducing the reduced discrete polymatroids, we provide a complete characterization of quadripartite representable matroids, which was until now an open problem, and hence, all <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> related to quadripartite representable matroids are the ideal ones. By the way, using our results, we give a new and simple proof that all <b>access</b> <b>structures</b> related to unipartite, bipartite and tripartite matroids coincide with the ideal ones...|$|E

Matroid ports are combinatorial objects that are almost equivalent to matroid-related <b>access</b> <b>structures.</b> They were introduced by Lehman in 1964 and a forbidden minor characterization was given by Seymour in 1976.
