The main goal of these algorithms is to offer services that satisfy the QoS requirements of individual users while guaranteeing {{at the same time}} an efficient utilization of network resources. In this paper we introduce a new service model that provides quantitative per-flow bandwidth guarantees, where users subscribe for a guaranteed rate; moreover, the network periodically individuates unused bandwidth and proposes short-term contracts where extra-bandwidth is allocated and guaranteed exclusively to users who can exploit it to transmit at a rate higher than their subscribed rate. To implement this service model we propose a dynamic provisioning architecture for intra-domain Quality of Service networks. We develop an efficient bandwidth allocation algorithm that takes explicitly into account traffic statistics to increase the users ’ benefit and the network revenue simultaneously. We demonstrate through simulation in several realistic network scenarios that the proposed dynamic provisioning model is superior to static provisioning in providing resource allocation both in terms of total <b>accepted</b> <b>load</b> and network revenue...|$|E

One {{of the most serious}} disadvantages of fully adaptive wormhole routers is its performance degradation due to the routing decision time. The key idea to overcome this shortcoming is the use of different clocks in a head flit and body flits, because the body flits can be forwarded immediately and the FIFO usually operates faster than route decision logic in an adaptive router. The major contributions of this paper are: 1) a proposal of a simple and efficient mechanism to improve the performance of fully adaptive wormhole routers, 2) a quantitative evaluation of the proposed mechanism showing that the proposed one can support higher throughput than a conventional one, and 3) an evaluation of hardware overhead for the proposed router.

In {{order to maintain}} full net-work symmetry, 2 D and 3 D Tori (k-ary 2 -cubes and k-ary 3 -cubes) must have {{the same number of}} nodes (k) per di-mension resulting in square or cubic topologies. Never-theless, for practical reasons, computer engineers have de-signed and built 2 D and 3 D Tori having a different number of nodes per dimension. These mixed-radix topologies are not edge-symmetric which translates into poor performance provoked by an unbalanced use of the network links. In this paper, we propose and analyze twisted 2 D and 3 D Tori which remove the network bottlenecks present in mixed-radix standard Tori. These new topologies recover edge-symmetry and, consequently, balance the utilization of their links. We describe the distance-related parame-ters of these twisted networks and use simulation to asses their performance under synthetic loads. The obtained re-sults show noticeable and consistent performance gains (up to a 88 % increase in <b>accepted</b> <b>load).</b> In addition, we pro-pose scalable and practicable packet routing and folding techniques for these interconnection subsystems.

40|$|In optical {{dedicated}} path protection (1 1), {{the same}} optical signal is transmitted along both working and backup paths. Thus, in 1 1, the transmission parameters {{need to be}} configured {{according to the most}} impaired path, e. g., the backup one. This implies that the working signal is typically served with higher than necessary quality of transmission and occupies larger than necessary spectrum resources, leading to inefficient network resource utilization. In this study, we propose to apply the recently introduced signal overlap technique to improve network efficiency of optical dedicated path protection. The signal overlap technique enables uncorrelated optical signals to be superimposed along the same spectrum resources. It relies on a cancellation detection strategy also exploited in wireless communications and recently applied on coherent optical receivers. In particular, this study summarizes the key aspect and transmission performance of the overlap technique and discusses its implementation complexity. Then, two signal overlap schemes, namely, working signal overlap and working and backup signal overlap are introduced for effective optical dedicated path protection. An integer linear programming (ILP) formulation based on the routing, modulation, and spectrum allocation problem and an efficient heuristic are then presented to effectively assess the performance of the proposed overlap-based 1 1 protection strategy under various topologies and traffic profiles. In the considered simulative scenarios (e. g., network diameters well below a thousand kilometers), results show that the more efficient working and backup signal overlap scheme significantly improves the <b>accepted</b> <b>load</b> of dedicated protection requests.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} development of an improved method for the static and dynamic analysis of driven piles for both forward and inverse solutions. Wave propagation in piles, which is the result of pile head (or toe) impact and the distributed mass and elasticity of the pile, was analyzed in two ways: forward (the hammer is modeled and the pile response and capacity for a certain blow count is estimated) or inverse (the force-time and velocity-or displacement-time history from driving data is used to estimate the pile capacity.) The finite element routine developed was a three dimensional model of the hammer, pile and soil system using the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, Newmark 2 ̆ 7 s method for the dynamic solution and a modified Newton method for the static solution. Soil properties were aggregated to simplify data entry and analysis. The three-dimensional model allowed for more accurate modeling of the various parts of the system and phenomena that are not well addressed with current one-dimensional methods, including bending effects in the cap and shaft response of tapered piles. Soil layering was flexible and could either follow the grid generation or be manually input. The forward method could either model the hammer explicitly or use a given force-time history, analyzing the pile response. The inverse method used an optimization technique to determine the aggregated soil properties of a given layering scheme. In both cases the static axial capacity of the pile was estimated using the same finite element model as the dynamic method and incrementally loaded. The results were then analyzed using <b>accepted</b> <b>load</b> test interpretation criteria. The model was run in test cases against current methods to verify its features, one of which was based on actual field data using current techniques for both data acquisition and analysis, with reasonable correlation of the results.

Compared to previous exoskeletons, the device is ultra-lightweight, resulting in low mechanical impedance and inertia. The exosuit has custom McKibben style pneumatic actuators that can assist the hip, knee and ankle. The actuators attach to the exosuit through a network of soft, inextensible webbing triangulated to attachment points utilizing a novel approach we call the virtual anchor technique. This approach is designed to transfer forces to locations on the body that can best <b>accept</b> <b>load.</b> Pneumatic actuation was chosen for this initial prototype because the McKibben actuators are soft and can be easily driven by an off-board compressor. The exosuit itself (human interface and actuators) had a mass of 3500 g and with peripherals (excluding air supply) is 7144 g. In order to examine the exosuit’s performance, a pilot study with one subject was performed which investigated {{the effect of the}} ankle plantar-flexion timing on the wearer’s hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics and metabolic power when walking. Wearing the suit in a passive unpowered mode had little effect on hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics as compared to baseline walking when not wearing the suit. Engaging the actuators at the ankles at 30 % of the gait cycle for 250 ms altered joint kinematics the least and also minimized metabolic power. The subject’s average metabolic power was 386. 7 W, almost identical to the average power when wearing no suit (381. 8 W), and substantially less than walking with the unpowered suit (430. 6 W). This preliminary work demonstrates that the exosuit can comfortably transmit joint torques to the user while not restricting mobility and that with further optimization, has the potential to reduce the wearer’s metabolic cost during walking.
