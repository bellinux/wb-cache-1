40|$|Entry to the {{information}} age and effective life in information-oriented society requires an understanding of its characteristics. One of the social institutions that will undergo extensive changes at this age is general and higher education and training institutions. The aim of this review study is {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of e learning in learning. This paper is a review study carried out using Medline and CINAHL databases and Google search engine. The studies used include review articles and English meta-analysis of language. Of the retrieved results, 38 documents including articles, books and web sites were investigated and classified. At first, the background of e learning was studied history and in the next section its effectiveness in learning was briefly examined. The overall benefits of e-learning include the promotion of learning, independence and individual satisfaction, learning at anytime, anywhere and with any background, learning without the same prerequisites, speed and process of learning due to individual needs, individual learning along with cooperative learning, saving time and costs significantly, the possibility of teaching and learning for all people, mutual teaching and learning, getting quick results in learning, learning more by using multimedia and maintaining resources and reducing environmental <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> <b>pollution.</b> The results of studies suggest positive effects of e-learning on learning thus it is suggested that this approach be used more in education, which requires building the required grounds. ...|$|E

In particular, we extensively survey the features that can be efficiently extracted from compressed video <b>and</b> <b>audio,</b> which include visual, motion, coding, <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> features. We also discuss typical applications of these compressed-domain features in video <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> indexing <b>and</b> analysis. Finally, we give a summary of important visual <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> descriptors in the current MPEG- 7 standard draft, and discuss the possibility of extracting these descriptors directly from compressed video <b>and</b> <b>audio...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{architecture}} of World Wide Web (WWW) browsers and servers support full file transfer for document retrieval.

Full file transfer and TCP are unsuitable for continuous media, such as real time <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> video. In order for the WWW to support continuous media, we require the transmission of video <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> on-demand <b>and</b> in real time, {{as well as new}} protocols for real time data.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a technique for dynamically grouping digital ink <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> to support user interaction in freeform note-taking systems. For ink, groups of strokes might correspond to words, lines, or paragraphs of handwritten text. For audio, groups {{might be a}} complete spoken phrase or a speaker turn in a conversation. Ink <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> grouping is important for editing operations such as deleting or moving chunks of ink <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> notes. The grouping technique is based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering. This clustering algorithm yields groups of ink or audio {{in a range of}} sizes, depending on the level in the hierarchy, and thus provides structure for simple interactive selection and rapid non-linear expansion of a selection. Ink <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> grouping is also important for marking portions of notes for subsequent browsing and retrieval. Integration of the ink <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> clusters provides a flexible way to browse the notes by selecting the ink cluster and playing the correspond [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Meanwhile, {{some people}} tried to design {{specific}} model to combine visual feature <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> feature. Jiang et al.

[13] constructed a bigraph with temporal concurrency between visual words and employed a k-way segmentation algorithm to combine visual <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> features. In this work, we propose to construct a spatio-temporal bigraph and use the k-way segmentation algorithm to combine multiple features.|$|R

40|$|Emerging {{high-speed}} networks {{give rise}} to a new class of applications in the domain of multimedia.

With the exception of purely conversational applications like Teleconferencing all other multimedia applications require a storage facility for video <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> data. We will subsequently call this facility a video server. The special nature of video <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> data makes it impossible to employ a normal file server design for a video server.
