SACE gravity <b>feed</b> <b>drilling</b> is a novel micromachining technology for use on non-conducting materials that has yet to move beyond academic investigation. However, SACE is a promising technology. It can be used to create high quality structures, at low cost, using a machine that could be installed into any laboratory.

The goal of this thesis is to quantify and reduce the variability in SACE gravity <b>feed</b> <b>drilling.</b> This goal is accomplished through three steps.

This work focuses on one such mining drill jumbo which is actually a redundant robotic manipulator with eight degrees of freedom, because it has six revolute joints and two prismatic joints.

MethodsBased on force analysis and previous works, anotologic drill was modified and equipped with three sensors. Under various conditions, the drill was used to simulate three drilling faults and normal drilling, and signals from the drill were analyzed to extract the characteristic signal. A multi–sensor information fusion system and a stop program were designed to recognize drilling faults and stop drilling. ResultsSignals from each sensor changed consistently in response to drilling condition changes, with high repeatability and regularity. The average identification rate was 72. 625 %, 68. 575 %, 70. 5 % and 81. 3 % respectively for the three simulated drilling faults and normal drilling. The stop program stopped drilling in 0. 2 ~ 0. 3 seconds when a drilling faults was detected. ConclusionsThis study shows that the forces acting on the drill bit change predictably in the three simulated drilling conditions; that using suitable BP neural networks, the drilling faults can be reliably identified, and that a stop program based upon characteristic signal recognition can stop drilling quickly upon detecting drilling faults.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation into the feasibility of deep-hole microdrilling a nickel-based superalloy. This material is very challenging to machine and current drilling methods are based on non-conventional machining technologies; the traditional view is that microdrills are too fragile to be used for drilling this high-strength aerospace alloy. The work investigated mechanical microdrilling under various cutting condi-tions. Mechanical microdrilling may offer the chance of improved hole quality and surface integrity. Initially a review of literature was undertaken with a view to identify the best drill geometry for the production of micro holes in nickel-based alloys. Based on this review the best available commercial micro drills were selected. A special strategy was introduced for selecting the pilot drill in order to ensure gradual loading of the twist drill and reduce the chance of drill breakage. For the cutting tests, 0. 5 mm diameter twist drills were used in drilling tests to a depth of 5 mm. The effect of processing parameters such as <b>drill</b> <b>feed</b> rate, spindle speed, and peck depth were evaluated, and the tool wear mechanism was also investigated. The cutting performance was characterized by the number of holes produced before drill breakage.
