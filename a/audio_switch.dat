50|$|Picturephone {{arrived in}} the early 1970s. 1ESS switch was already going into service and {{provided}} a more sophisticated basis for advanced services, but was not yet as widely available, so 5XB was designated as the switching vehicle. Every Picturephone line has six wires: the old talking pair plus a video transmission pair and a video receiving pair. A new wideband switching fabric was designed using a 6-wire version of Type B crossbar switches, two of the wires being grounded, thus diminishing crosstalk for the two video pairs. When completing a Picturephone call, the completing marker first picked the line or trunk to which the audio portion of the call would be completed, and then set up both the <b>audio</b> <b>switches</b> and the video ones. Wideband remote switches (WBRS) were installed in smaller exchanges, as video concentrators for lines that were beyond video range from a larger exchange that {{had been given the}} Picturephone feature.|$|R

50|$|On 6 December 2014, Proton {{introduced}} the Suprima S Standard, a new base model variant which undercuts the Suprima S Executive {{by as much}} as RM6,900. The Suprima S Standard loses some equipment and trim, including several safety features, and offers several new, albeit downgraded components to achieve its lower pricing. The omissions include several interior components like the Android OS-powered Proton Infotainment System in favour of the more basic head-unit from the Proton Prevé Executive variant, as well as the lack of steering <b>audio</b> <b>switches,</b> YES 4G internet connectivity, and the rear lid on the floor console between the two front seats. On the exterior, the Suprima S loses the front foglights, engine cover and the black tape on the B-pillar sashes. The Suprima S Standard is fitted with the ten-spoke alloy rims first seen on the Proton Prevé, and not the hubcaps from the Proton Exora Bold Standard CFE as speculated from spyshots several days prior to the launch. The most significant omissions in the Suprima S Standard are its safety features; it is only equipped with dual front airbags, ABS and EBD, and is not equipped with side and curtain airbags, electronic stability control (ESC), traction control (TCS) and brake assist (BA), which are all offered in the Suprima S Executive. The anti-trap feature in the front power windows, front reactive headrest, driver-side overhead handle grip and seat belt reminder for the front passenger have also been omitted. Nonetheless, the Suprima S Standard comes with a new Panther Grey finish for the front dashboard panels and front position lamps which are of the bulb type, instead of the L.E.D. type on the Executive trim. The rest of the specifications, including the powertrain were left largely unchanged, and the Proton Suprima S Standard is priced at RM69,438 and RM69,888 for the solid and metallic paint options respectively, both on-the-road prices with insurance. Proton hopes to triple sales of the Suprima S with this new base model.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first detailed mathematical {{analysis of the}} ripple compensation technique for reducing audio distortion in a class-D amplifier with negative feedback. The amplifier converts a relatively low-frequency audio signal to a high-frequency train of rectangular pulses whose widths are slowly modulated according to the audio signal (pulse-width modulation, PWM). Distortion manifests itself through unwanted audio-frequency harmonics that arise in the output due to nonlinearities inherent in the design. In this paper, we first develop a small-signal model, which describes the fate of small-amplitude perturbations to a constant input, and demonstrate how this traditional engineering tool may be extended to allow one to infer the most significant contributions to the full output {{in response to a}} general audio input. We then compute the audio output of the amplifier through a perturbation expansion based on the ratio between <b>audio</b> and <b>switching</b> frequencies. Our results explicitly demonstrate how the ripple compensation technique significantly linearizes the output, thereby reducing the distortion...|$|R
5000|$|At that point, Flight 610 was {{scheduled}} to make a right turn to intercept the 168 degree course line of the DEN low frequency range, and then to proceed to the WONT intersection, which was its next clearance limit.

If the pilot had configured his <b>audio</b> selector <b>switches</b> properly, {{he would have been}} able to hear the aural Morse code identifier of [...] "A", for the north side of that low frequency range, and then as he neared the course line itself, he would begin to hear the [...] "N" [...] identifier.

5000|$|The film's opening {{sequence}} {{is presented in}} black and white. When Oscar is {{caught up in the}} tornado, the <b>audio</b> <b>switches</b> from monaural to stereo and eventually surround sound. The film shifts to full color when Oscar arrives in Oz; additionally, the aspect ratio gradually widens from 4:3 Academy ratio to 2.35:1 widescreen. As in the 1939 film, Glinda travels in giant bubbles, and the Emerald City is actually emerald; in the novel, characters wear tinted glasses to make it appear so. However, during the battle preparations sequence Oz can be seen wearing emerald goggles. The iconic green look of the Wicked Witch of the West is closer to her look in the classic film, as the Witch is a short, one-eyed crone in the novel. The Wicked Witches are portrayed as sisters, an idea which originated in the 1939 film. Also from the 1939 film is that several actors who play Oz characters make cameos in the Kansas segments, such as Frank (Zach Braff), Oscar's assistant whom he refers to as his [...] "trained monkey" [...] (Frank's [...] "Oz" [...] counterpart is the winged monkey Finley) and a young girl in a wheelchair (Joey King) who serves as the Kansas counterpart to China Girl (in Kansas, Oscar is unable to make the wheelchair-bound young girl walk, and gets a chance to do so when he repairs China Girl's broken legs). Annie (Michelle Williams), a woman wearing a gingham dress who inspires Oscar to be a good and great person, informs him that she has been proposed to by John Gale, presumably hinting at Dorothy Gale's parental lineage (Annie's [...] "Oz" [...] counterpart, Glinda, also inspires Oscar to be a better person). Theodora (Mila Kunis), who became the Wicked Witch of the West after suffering from a [...] "broken heart" [...] caused by Oscar's [...] "betrayal", has no Kansas counterpart. However, an unnamed woman who worked as Oscar's assistant at the time and suddenly left after suffering from a [...] "broken heart", may be a possible reference to the existence of Theodora's unknown counterpart. The character of Miss Almira Gulch, who did not exist in Baum's novel, is the Kansas counterpart of the Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 film.|$|R
