50|$|The Legislature also {{passed a}} law that year {{reducing}} the maximum commitment age from 16 to 14 years old.

They also abolishment of the <b>alternative</b> <b>sentence.</b> The <b>alternative</b> <b>sentence</b> was handed down by the judge at the time of sentencing and was designed to specify a sentence to prison if the boy was incorrigible at the reform school. In practice, however, it was found that in most cases the <b>alternative</b> <b>sentence</b> to prison was of a lesser duration than the reform school, sometimes amounting to only days. Because of this, some boys would act out at the reform school hoping for their <b>alternative</b> <b>sentence</b> to be enacted and for their sentence to be carried out in prison for a few days or weeks instead of the sentence to the reform school throughout their childhood.Also enacted was an order that every sentence, to the reform school would be until the age of 18; previously it was 21. At the time, it was thought that the reform process should take upwards to 4 years to thoroughly educate the boys in character, schooling, industry, and labor. Additionally the power to commit inmates was restricted to judges of the Superior and probate courts, and all boys should have legal representation in court provided by the state. It was thought that by limiting the number of judges able to commit boys to the state reform school the number of boys committed for minor offenses would be reduced.|$|E

The individuals and organizations represented in the brief have all collaborated together to build and support what are colloquially known as “problem solving dockets”: courts that are specialized, <b>alternative</b> <b>sentencing</b> dockets that offer diversionary programs to qualified offenders. The dockets are run out of Maryland’s district and circuit courts, but not separate, freestanding judicial institutions. Two issues were to be considered by the Court of Appeals: 1) Do Maryland’s <b>alternative</b> <b>sentencing</b> dockets lack fundamental jurisdiction by violating the Maryland Constitution and exceeding judicial authority? 2) Do <b>alternative</b> <b>sentencing</b> dockets engage in procedures that violate criminal due process rights and exercise judicial bias? The amici brief argues that the Maryland Constitution grants courts broad and extensive authority to structure <b>alternative</b> <b>sentencing</b> dockets within Maryland’s judiciary system and utilize these dockets to administer justice, thereby making these dockets constitutional. The brief points to the dockets specifically authorized by the Maryland legislature and that the existence of the statutory scheme quells the petitioner’s claims of due process violations, judicial bias, and double jeopardy. The brief then further considers whether there should be state-wide, minimum standards for <b>alternative</b> <b>sentencing</b> dockets and what are {{the pros and cons of}} implementing standardization...|$|R

50|$|Initially {{based on}} the royal {{prerogative}} of mercy, and later under English Law, transportation was an <b>alternative</b> <b>sentence</b> imposed for a felony; it was typically imposed for offences for which death was deemed too severe. By 1670, as new felonies were defined, the option of being sentenced to transportation was allowed. Forgery of a document, for example, was a capital crime until the 1820s, when the penalty was reduced to transportation. Depending on the crime, the sentence was imposed for life or for a set period of years. If imposed {{for a period of}} years, the offender was permitted to return home after serving out his time, but had to make his own way back. Many offenders thus stayed in the colony as free persons, and might obtain employment as jailers or other servants of the penal colony.|$|E

50|$|Currently, {{the police}} {{exercise}} largely discretionary powers over juvenile matters. Police have three options available {{when confronted with}} a juvenile matter: take no further action, dismiss the case after speaking with the child’s guardians, or direct the matter to the prosecutor. Juvenile offenders are primarily subject to two main sanctions: the fine and detention. Furthermore, three alternative sanctions exist: community service, reparations for damages, and the training order. Fines are an available alternative, but judges do not typically impose fines on juveniles; they are not considered an appropriate sanction because juveniles rarely end up paying the fines themselves. Secondly, while fourteen percent of adults receive unconditional sentences, only three percent of juvenile incarceration is unconditional. Juvenile detentions are typically conditional and coincide with community service orders. The community service order was implemented for juveniles after its successful introduction into adult penology. In 1998, seventy percent of all juvenile cases disposed of in court resulted in an <b>alternative</b> <b>sentence</b> (community service, training order, or reparations). Juveniles {{between the ages of}} 12 and 16 can be sentenced up to twelve months, whereas individuals between 16 and 18 years old can be sentenced up to 24 months.|$|E

This will maximize the peaceful character of the law but also would affect levels significantly above sentence enhancers ’ purpose. In other words, the criminal law has more need for legal flexibility, giving a considerable assistance and judicial bodies. This flexibility is achieved by using not only clearly defined penalties and stiffly but also creating an amalgam arising from the acquisition of qualitative elements of some types of penalties are available always maintaining sustainable character of the criminal sentence. This flexibility between types of sentences leads us first what is called <b>alternative</b> <b>sentence.</b> Must have a clear alternative that should not understand this notion of broad term for a criminal offense then you can choose punishment of imprisonment or fine, because this determines the choice of law without much skating, but we are dealing with a process which allows us to within a clearly defined type of punishment may be able to detach some other elements of criminal justice thus building a sustainable form of criminal punishment completely featured.

40|$|Many {{countries}} have recently adopted electronic monitoring (EM) as an <b>alternative</b> <b>sentence</b> to reduce incarceration while maintaining public safety. However, the empirical {{evidence on the}} effects of EM on recidivism (relative to prison) is very scarce worldwide. Our empirical strategy exploits the incremental rollout of EM in France, which started as a local experiment in four courts in 2000 – 2001 and was later adopted by an increasing number of courts. Our instrumental variables estimates show that fully converting prison sentences into EM has long-lasting beneficial effects on recidivism, with estimated reductions in the probability of reconviction of 6 – 7 percentage points (9 – 11 percent) after 5 years. The presence of heterogeneous effects suggests that both rehabilitation and deterrence are important factors in reducing long-term recidivism and that EM can be a very cost-effective alternative to short prison sentences...|$|E
