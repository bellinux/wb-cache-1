25|$|There {{are several}} common types of {{contoured}} main deck ULDs, that are contoured (curved {{to fit in}} the plane's body) to provide as much cargo volume as possible. Initially ULD contouring was simply a triangle removed from one or two corners of {{the profile of the}} ULD, such as the common LD3 and LD6. Main deck ULDs use curves for the contoured shape to truly maximize cargo volume. Upper deck ULDs <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> lower deck ULDs that are either the full width of the plane with two corners of the profile removed (lower deck LD6 lower), or that container is cut in half, down the center line of the plane, (lower deck LD3 and upper deck AAX).|$|E
25|$|The sea and island zone of Quảng Ninh has {{a unique}} terrain. There are more than 2,000 islands, making up {{two thirds of the}} country's islands. They extend along the coast for more than 250km and divide into {{numerous}} layers. The largest islands are Cái Bầu and Bản Sen, while the smallest <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> rocks in a garden. Vân Đồn and Cô Tô are island districts. There are thousands of islands on Hạ Long Bay and Bái Tử Long Bay, many of which contain caves. Besides areas of alluvial deposits, there are also white sand zones which have built up from tidal action. Some places have formed white sand mines producing materials for the glass industry (Van Hai), or have developed into tourism spots (Trà Cổ, Quan Lạn, Minh Châu, Ngọc Vừng).|$|E

Before filming, ABC {{announced that the}} production would adapt elements from the original 1900 book, rather than the 1939 film. such as the Silver Shoes instead of the Ruby slippers. [...] On August 25, 2004, {{it was announced that}} Hilary Duff, Jessica Simpson, and Ashanti had auditioned for the role of Dorothy Gale, but Ashanti had won the part. When asked about how she felt about working with the Muppets, Ashanti replied, [...] "I love children, and to me, the Muppets <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> little kids." [...] She also stated, [...] "The director had to give me a few pointers and tips for acting with them, {{but the most important thing}} that I learned was to keep eye contact." [...] Also in August 2004, BBC News reported that Quentin Tarantino would appear in the film.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrasting}} Miles with Peter Parker, Bendis has depicted different {{conflicts and}} anxieties for the character. Right after acquiring his superhuman abilities from a spider bite {{at the home}} of his uncle, Aaron, whom Miles admires but he does not initially know is a career criminal, Miles' father, Jefferson, explains to Miles that before Miles was born, Jefferson and Aaron were thieves who spent time in prison, and that while Jefferson reformed when he got older, Aaron has not. According to Bendis, this gives Miles cause to wonder if the traits that lead to criminal behavior are hardwired into his DNA, leading him to question whether he is essentially a good person or not, and what his future holds for him. These issues further haunt Miles after he becomes disillusioned with Aaron, and Aaron dies from an accidental explosion triggered during a battle between the two of them, saying, [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> me" [...] to Miles before dying.|$|E

500|$|In September 1945, Ulam left Los Alamos {{to become}} an {{associate}} professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. [...] In January 1946, he suffered an acute attack of encephalitis, which put his life in danger, but which was alleviated by emergency brain surgery. [...] During his recuperation, many friends visited, including Nicholas Metropolis from Los Alamos and the famous mathematician Paul Erdős, who remarked: [...] "Stan, you <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> before." [...] This was encouraging, because Ulam was concerned about the state of his mental faculties, for he had lost the ability to speak during the crisis. [...] Another friend, Gian-Carlo Rota, asserted in a 1987 article that the attack changed Ulam's personality: afterwards, he turned from rigorous pure mathematics to more speculative conjectures concerning the application of mathematics to physics and biology; Rota also cites Ulam's former collaborator Paul Stein as noting that Ulam was sloppier in his clothing afterwards, and John Oxtoby as noting that Ulam before the encephalitis could work for hours on end doing calculations, while when Rota worked with him, was reluctant to solve even a quadratic equation. [...] This assertion was not accepted by Françoise Aron Ulam.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Eminem played voicemails to the {{audience}} during his Anger Management Tour allegedly from Carey and reported as saying [...] "Why won't you see me? Why won't you call me?". Eminem reiterated his dislike of Carey the following year on a track called [...] "Jimmy Crack Corn" [...] from his compilation album, , with the lyrics [...] "Your mind's on us like mine's on Mariah / And y'all <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> her, you're all fucking liars / But I'll just keep fucking you like I fucked her / Right in the ass with KY yes sir." [...] 50 Cent referenced Carey's denial of the relationship on a track called [...] "All of Me" [...] from his third studio album Curtis in 2007: [...] "Em predicted it all, I don't know how he knew it / He said women from Hollywood they liars, liars, liars / You fuck them, they get you heated, deny it like Mariah." [...] Two years later, Eminem released a song called [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad", on which he took aim at Carey's husband Nick Cannon by calling him a [...] "prick" [...] and wishing him [...] "luck with the fucking whore". The lead single from Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel was [...] "Obsessed". Many critics believed the track to be about Eminem, and its accompanying music video portrayed Carey being followed by a male stalker which critics also thought bore a strong resemblance to the rapper. Mansfield thought that the lyrical content of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{appeared to be a}} continuation of [...] "Obsessed" [...] and her feud with Eminem, as Carey sings [...] "I know you're not a rapper, so you better stop spittin' it." ...|$|E
500|$|Sarah {{ends up in}} an oubliette, {{where she}} reunites with Hoggle. After they confront Jareth and escape one of his traps, the two {{encounter}} a large beast named Ludo. Hoggle flees in a cowardly fashion while Sarah befriends Ludo. After another riddle, she loses him in a forest. Hoggle encounters Jareth, who gives him a peach and instructs him {{to give it to}} Sarah, calling his loyalty into question, as he was supposed to lead her out of the maze. Sarah is assaulted by a group of creatures called Fireys with detachable body parts who try to remove her head, but Hoggle comes to her aid. She kisses him, and Jareth magically sends them to the Bog of Eternal Stench as punishment, where they reunite with Ludo. Sarah, Hoggle, and Ludo meet a guard of the bridge out of the swamp named Sir Didymus, an anthropomorphic fox, and his Old English Sheepdog [...] "steed" [...] named Ambrosius. After Ludo howls and summons a trail of rocks to save Sarah from falling into the bog, Didymus joins the group (her three new friends <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> some of the toys in her room). After the group gets hungry, Hoggle gives Sarah the peach and runs away as she falls into a trance and begins to lose her memories. She has a dream where Jareth comes to her at a masquerade ball, proclaiming his love for her, but she begins to remember and escapes, falling into a junkyard. After an old Junk Lady fails to brainwash her and her memory is jogged, she is rescued by Ludo and Didymus, and they are right outside Goblin City near Jareth's castle. They are confronted by the gate guard, but Hoggle bravely comes to their rescue. Despite his feeling unworthy of forgiveness for his betrayal, Sarah and the others welcome him back, and they enter the city together.|$|E

2500|$|As a teenager, she {{formed a}} folk rock band named The Breeders with her sister. She {{then became a}} {{prolific}} songwriter, as she {{found it easier to}} write songs than cover them. Deal later commented on her songwriting output: [...] "I got like a hundred songs when I was like 16, 17 ... The music is pretty good, but the lyrics <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>like,</b> OH MY GOD.

[...] The Deals bought microphones, an eight-track tape recorder, a mixer, speakers, and amps for a bedroom studio.

2500|$|In {{almost all}} {{cultures}} objects are named using {{one or two}} words equivalent to [...] "kind" [...] (genus) and [...] "particular kind" [...] (species). When made up of two words (a binomial) the name usually consists of a noun (like salt, dog or star) and an adjectival second word that helps describe the first, and therefore makes the name, as a whole, more [...] "specific", for example, lap dog, sea salt, or film star. The meaning of the noun used for a common name may have been lost or forgotten (whelk, elm, lion, shark, pig) but when the common name is extended to two or more words much more is conveyed about the organism's use, appearance or other special properties (sting ray, poison apple, giant stinking hogweed, hammerhead shark). These noun-adjective binomials <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> our own names with a family or surname like Simpson and another adjectival Christian or forename name that specifies which Simpson, say Homer Simpson. It seems {{reasonable to assume that}} the form of scientific names we call binomial nomenclature is derived from this simple and practical way of constructing common names - but with the use of Latin as a universal language.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2005, Takei {{revealed}} in {{an issue of}} Frontiers magazine that he is gay and {{had been in a}} committed relationship with his partner, Brad Altman, for 18 years; the move was prompted by then California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's veto of same-sex marriage legislation. He said, [...] "It's not really coming out, which suggests opening a door and stepping through. It's more like a long, long walk through what began as a narrow corridor that starts to widen." [...] Nevertheless, Takei's sexuality had been an open secret among Star Trek fans since the 1970s, and Takei did not conceal his active membership in LGBT organizations, including Frontrunners, where he developed public friendships with openly gay couples such as Kevin and Don Norte. In an on-air telephone interview with Howard Stern in December 2005, Takei explained, [...] " [...] are masculine, we are feminine, we are caring, we are abusive. We <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> straight people, in terms of our outward appearance and our behavior. The only difference is that we are oriented to people of our own gender." [...] Takei also described Altman as [...] "a saint" [...] for helping to take care of Takei's terminally ill mother.|$|E
2500|$|The {{physical}} {{aspects of}} Lena and Bianca's romance were heavily downplayed by the series. When {{asked if she}} thought she and Riegel had succeeded in living up to the [...] "couple's groundbreaking and progressive" [...] reputation, Sosnovska responded, [...] "Yes, we succeeded to a certain extent. We succeeded in making this couple acceptable." [...] After a pause, Sosnovska continued, [...] "Not acceptable in a realistic sense, since our relationship hasn’t been portrayed truly realistically, {{which would have been}} nice." [...] She described Bianca and Lena's physical relationship as [...] "kind of ostentatiously reserved" [...] compared to what gets shown between heterosexual couples, [...] "although I’m quite shocked by what does get shown between the heterosexual couples." [...] Even though the couple had recently started [...] "dating" [...] again, as the writers also scripted a love triangle including Maggie, there was an apparent double-standard regarding intimacy between the same sex lovers; in the entire year of Lena and Bianca's on-again, off-again relationship, the two women had only kissed twice onscreen. The final obstacles given to the couple's onscreen intimacy were Bianca's rape by Michael and pregnancy with his child, which were controversial and seen by viewers as desperate attempts by the network to avoid lesbian love scenes. AfterEllen.com editor Sarah Warn stated that {{it was a way to}} assure Bianca's continued asexuality. Warn added that [...] "the pregnant-lesbian storyline" [...] is a favorite refuge for television writers who both want to avoid dealing with the sexual aspects of lesbian relationships and who want to [...] "normalize" [...] the lesbian characters — [...] "to show viewers that, at their core, lesbians <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> heterosexual women — who of course, all want to be mothers". In 2004, though Lena and Bianca were allowed to kiss for a third time onscreen, it came at the end of their romance, as Lena went back to Poland to tend to her ailing mother and the couple was later written to have broken up over the phone.|$|E
