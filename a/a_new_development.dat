5|$|Seizing upon <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>development</b> to {{visualize}} particle tracks, created by Donald Glaser and {{known as a}} bubble chamber, Alvarez realized the device was just what was needed, if only it {{could be made to}} function with liquid hydrogen. Hydrogen nuclei, which are protons, made the simplest and most desirable target for interactions with the particles produced by the Bevatron. He began a development program to build a series of small chambers, and championed the device to Ernest Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} housebuilding programme {{started in}} the 1960s, and Radyr's population grew rapidly — particularly children. In 1964 Radyr Comprehensive School had 135 pupils on its roll. This number more than trebled in the next decade. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>development,</b> the Danescourt estate, was built on land surrounding Radyr Court and St John the Baptist parish church, and the land was officially incorporated as a suburb of Cardiff in 1974. Danybryn Woods, near the development, was retained as the entire forest is protected by a tree preservation order and is home to many species of plants and wildlife. Radyr railway station was renovated in 1998 and the tracks through the station were renewed, reducing journey times to Cardiff city centre.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{problems}} revealed in flight tests, McDonnell reviewed the program and proposed <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>development</b> based on a more conventional design promising a Mach 0.9 capability, using alternatively a 35° swept wing and delta wing. McDonnell also considered adding a telescoping extension to the docking trapeze that would extend the device below the turbulent air under the mother ship. Before any further work on the trapeze, other modifications to the XF-85, or continued design studies on its follow-up could be carried out, the USAF canceled the XF-85 program on 24 October 1949.|$|E

5|$|Development of Xenosaga Episode II began {{development}} following {{the completion of}} Episode I. Following Episode I, series creator Tetsuya Takahashi gave control of the Xenosaga series to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>development</b> team, resulting {{in a number of}} changes. The gameplay system was redesigned based on feedback from Episode I. The scenario, written by Norihiko Yonesaka, was based on the original draft by Takahashi and Soraya Saga, with Episode II being Saga's last contribution to the main trilogy. The music was composed by Yuki Kajiura and Shinji Hosoe, who worked separately on the cinematic and gameplay soundtracks respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, an unofficial, high-definition remake was {{announced}} titled Sonic the Hedgehog 2 HD, which included development members {{who would later}} work on Sonic Mania. In 2012, {{it was reported that}} a potential keylogger was included with an alpha build of the game, which led to the project being discontinued due to the controversy. In 2014, the project was restarted under <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>development</b> team. The final version is planned to feature additional stages and the option to play levels as Knuckles the Echidna.|$|E
5|$|In May 1943 Albert Speer, the Reich's Minister of Armaments and War Production, {{informed}} Adolf Hitler of {{work that}} was being carried out to produce a supergun capable of firing hundreds of shells an hour over long distances. The newly designed gun, codenamed the Hochdruckpumpe ("High Pressure Pump", HDP for short) and later designated as the V-3, {{was one of the}} V-weapons– Vergeltungswaffen ("retaliation weapons")– developed by Nazi Germany in the later stages of the war to attack Allied targets. Long-range guns were not <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>development,</b> but the high-pressure detonations used to fire shells from previous such weapons, including the Paris gun, rapidly wore out their barrels.|$|E

5|$|Norwegian {{control over}} the Faroe Islands and Shetland was strong due to the {{importance}} of Bergen as a trading centre, while Orkney, the Hebrides and Man had more natural ties with the Scottish mainland. Although traditionally having had ties with the community of Norse settlers in northern Scotland, Scottish rulers had increasingly asserted their sovereignty over the entire mainland. Haakon had at the same time gained stronger control of the Hebrides and Man than any Norwegian ruler since Magnus Barefoot. As part of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>development</b> the Scottish king Alexander II claimed the Hebrides and requested to buy the islands from Norway, but Haakon staunchly rejected the proposals. Following Alexander II's death, his son Alexander III continued and stepped up his father's policy by sending an embassy to Norway in 1261, and thereafter attacking the Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of the {{previous}} game in the Mana series, 1999's Legend of Mana, several members of the development team for the game left Square to form <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>development</b> studio, Brownie Brown. These included character designer Kameoka Shinichi and lead artist Kouji Tsuda, as well as several other writers and artists. Square, in turn, outsourced development of the fifth game in the Mana series to Brownie Brown. The producer for the game was Square's Koichi Ishii, who had directed or designed the previous games in the series. Ishii had served as the director for the original game in the series, Final Fantasy Adventure, which Sword of Mana is a remake of. The remake, in addition to adding enhanced graphics to the original Game Boy title, sought to add elements present in later games in the series, such as the Ring Command menu system, and to expand the game's storyline. It also removed elements from the Final Fantasy series, which had been placed in the original game {{as a part of the}} marketing for the game before its sequels moved to be a distinct series.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh was educated, {{along with}} his younger brother Charles, at Trinity College, Oxford. Although Charles was a studious young man, who planned to enter the church on graduation, Peter had an active social life in both Oxford and London. He holidayed in {{southern}} resorts including St Leonards-on-Sea, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>development</b> in Sussex, where he admired the work of architect James Burton. He became close friends with Burton's son Decimus, who was also an architect. The two men {{were involved in the}} formation of London's Athenaeum Club and Burton designed the club's building in Pall Mall. Hesketh received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1823 and his Master of Arts degree in 1826. That same year, he married Eliza Debonnaire Metcalfe, the daughter of Sir Theophilus Metcalfe, 2nd Baronet, commonly known by her middle name. Debonnaire's father gave the couple a house in Dover, but they also spent time at the Rossall estate. The couple were very close to Charles and his new wife Anna, and their sister Anna, and her husband Thomas Knowlys. Charles was ordained in 1828 and as patron of St Chad's Church in Poulton-le-Fylde, Peter presented his brother with that curacy.|$|E

5|$|Manor Farm and Park Wood {{were nearly}} {{demolished}} {{in the early}} 1900s {{to make way for}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>development</b> planned in partnership with King's College and the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council. A town planning competition was won by A & J Soutar from Wandsworth, who suggested a symmetrical design across the parish which would have seen a total of 7,642 new homes built. St. Martin's church would have been the only example of historical architecture left in Ruislip. An outline map of the new development proposal was made public on 30 November 1910 with few objections. A Local Board inquiry followed on 17 February 1911 which required negotiations with landowners to allow for a full planning scheme to be compiled. This was presented in February 1913 with an adaptation of the original Soutars plan and received approval from the Local Government Board in September 1914. Three roads with residential housing, Manor Way, Windmill Way and Park Way were completed before the outbreak of the First World War when all construction work was halted. It was not resumed until 1919, though the plan was substantially scaled back as work slowed throughout the next decade.|$|E
5|$|Salford Docks (also called Manchester Docks) {{were opened}} by Queen Victoria in 1894, {{providing}} docks in Manchester and Salford for the Manchester Ship Canal which linked Manchester to the sea. During the 1970s, the docks fell into decline as they proved {{too small for}} new, larger ships, {{and when they were}} abandoned in 1982 over 3,000 people lost their jobs. Salford City Council purchased the docks in 1984 and since then they underwent regeneration as a centre of tourism in Salford, which included the construction of the Lowry Centre. More than 10,000 people are employed in the Quays in jobs such as retail, construction, and e-commerce. In 2007, it was confirmed that the BBC would be moving five of its departments to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>development</b> on Pier 9 of Salford Quays, to be called MediaCityUK. The move, which is expected to be completed by 2011, will create up to 15,500 jobs and add £1bn to the regional economy over 5 years.|$|E
