5|$|The RGA reorganised {{itself to}} become the {{governing}} Rhodesia Party, with Coghlan as Southern Rhodesia's first Premier. The title was changed to Prime Minister in 1933 by George Mitchell, the third man to hold the office. In 1932, the Southern Rhodesian leader was first invited to an Imperial Conference. Although Southern Rhodesia was not a dominion, it was seen elsewhere in the Empire as a sui generis case among Britain's colonies, <b>and</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> inclusion, particularly {{as it was the}} only one which governed itself. Southern Rhodesian Prime Ministers thereafter became a regular fixture at such meetings and, from 1944, at Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences.|$|E

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite) does not practice polygamy, but recognizes it as a legitimate historical doctrine.|$|E
25|$|The {{final and}} perhaps most {{important}} factor which secured Britain's heritage was a change in public opinion. This was in part brought about by the Destruction of the Country House exhibition held at London's Victoria and Albert Museum in 1974. The response to this highly publicised exhibition was very positive; {{for the first time the}} public, rather than a few intellectual bodies, became aware that country houses were an important part of the national heritage <b>and</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> preservation. Today, over 370,000 buildings are listed, which includes all buildings erected before 1700 and most constructed before 1840. After that date a building has to be of architectural or historical importance to be protected.|$|E
25|$|Hindu texts {{accept a}} polytheistic framework, {{but this is}} {{generally}} conceptualized as the divine essence or luminosity that gives vitality and animation to the inanimate natural substances. There is a divine in everything, human beings, animals, trees and rivers. It is observable in offerings to rivers, trees, tools of one's work, animals and birds, rising sun, friends and guests, teachers and parents. It is the divine in these that makes each sacred <b>and</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> reverence. This seeing divinity in everything, state Buttimer and Wallin, makes the Vedic foundations of Hinduism quite distinct from Animism. The animistic premise sees multiplicity, power differences and competition between man and man, man and animal, as well as man and nature. The Vedic view does not see this competition, rather sees a unifying divinity that connects everyone and everything.|$|E

Like the movie, its title has a fascinating history too; The title was changed many times due to superstitious reasons, but finally the original stayed. After the failure of Daera in 1953, Pakeezah as an idea, was roaming around in Amrohi's mind. A concept, he said, was irretrievably fixed by his love for his wife. He hoped to create a film which would be worthy of her as an actress, <b>and</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> the love he felt for her as a woman. Kamal declared that for every line he wrote, he had Meena in mind. He wished to present her on the screen as no one had before: beautiful, sad, sanguine, dejected, calculating, sexy - he ambitioned to capture as many dimensions of her as he knew of.|$|E
25|$|Richard Dawkins {{outlines}} in The Selfish Gene (1976) {{that humans}} are machines made of genes and genes are the grounding for everything we do. The gene-centric view outlines that natural selection, evolution and all behaviour must {{be traced back to}} the survival of competing genes as an extension of Darwin’s theory being the survival of competing individuals. The main goal of individuals, coming from the instinct of our genes, is to reproduce and thrive, where thriving involves protection, conquering competition and future growth. Therefore, everything that we do relates to thriving in our environment above competition, including the way we consume as a form of survival in our environment when simply purchasing the basic physiological needs of food, water and warmth. We also consume to thrive above others, for example in conspicuous consumption where a luxury car represents money and high social status and the application of makeup makes the person and their genes seem more attractive <b>and</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> passing to offspring.|$|E
25|$|While some {{commentators}} {{have seen the}} party lose focus {{with the rise of}} SAP neoliberal study groups, the Swedish Social Democratic Party has for many years appealed to Swedes as innovative, capable, <b>and</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> running the state. The Social Democrats {{became one of the most}} successful political parties in the world, with some structural advantages in addition to their auspicious birth within vibrant folkrörelser. At the close of the nineteenth century, liberals and socialists had to band together to augment establishment democracy, which was at that point embarrassingly behind in Sweden; they could point to formal democratic advances elsewhere to motivate political action. In addition to being small, Sweden was a semi-peripheral country at the beginning of the twentieth century, considered unimportant to competing global political factions; so it was permitted more independence, while soon the existence of communist and capitalist superpowers allowed social democracy to flourish in the geo-political interstices. The SAP has the resource of sharing ideas and experiences, and working with its sister parties throughout the Nordic countries. Sweden could also borrow and innovate upon ideas from English-language economists, which was an advantage for the Social Democrats in the Great Depression; but more advantageous for the bourgeois parties in the 1980s and afterward. While the SAP has not been innocent of repressing communists, the party has overall benefitted, in government coalition and in avoiding severe stagnation and drift, by engaging in relatively constructive relationships with the more radical Left Party and the Green Party. The early SAP had internal resources as well, in creative politicians with brilliant tactical minds, and similarly creative labor economists at their disposal.|$|E

500|$|Harold Stanley Marcus (April 20, 1905– January 22, 2002) was {{an early}} {{president}} (1950–1972) and later {{chairman of the board}} (1972–1976) of the luxury retailer Neiman Marcus in Dallas, Texas, which his father and aunt had founded in 1907.

After Neiman Marcus was sold to Carter Hawley Hale Stores, Marcus initially remained in an advisory capacity to that company, but later began his own consulting business, which continued until his death. He served his local community as an avid patron of the fine arts and as a civic leader. In a chapter titled [...] "Mr. Stanley"— the name by which Marcus was known locally for decades— in his 1953 work Neiman-Marcus, Texas, Frank X.

[...] Although the work was generally regarded as a critical and public failure, aspects of its music have been recognised as among Tippett's best. The critic John Warrack writes that, after the violence of the opening acts, the third act's music has a lyrical warmth comparable to that of The Midsummer Marriage".
