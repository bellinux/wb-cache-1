5|$|In many {{developing}} countries, the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet {{has been proposed}} as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1974. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 3.88 to 32.79 USD per 50mg vial. In the United Kingdom this amount costs the NHS about £100.12. Versions that are pegylated and in liposomes are also available; however, <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive.</b> Doxorubicin was originally made from the bacteria Streptomyces peucetius.|$|E
5|$|NextWorth {{purchases}} used {{electronics and}} resells about 80-85 percent of them, while the remainder {{are sent to}} a network of partners for recycling. Many used iPhones are resold in countries where new ones <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive.</b> Sellers can fill out an online form to describe the used products they want to sell, then get a quote through the website. After receiving the quote, sellers have thirty days to ship the product using a pre-paid shipping label provided by NextWorth. The company wipes the device's memory and inspects the item before sending the seller reimbursement in 3-15 days depending on the payment method. If NextWorth appraises a product at a lower condition than the seller expected, they can get an explanation from NextWorth, challenge the quote, or reject it and get the product back.|$|E
5000|$|Cabinet faces. Solid wood {{remains a}} popular choice for cabinet parts, {{including}} bases, frames, doors, and sides. However, traditional-style solid-wood cabinetry <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> and many consumers opt for cabinets that incorporate particle board or plywood to reduce costs. Pricing for solid wood cabinet doors {{depends on the}} wood species used. For example, teak <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than cherry, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than maple, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than oak. Similarly, solid wood <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than plywood which, in turn, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than particle board or similar sheet goods.|$|R

5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{and their}} closer neighbours mostly {{cost less than}} silver; only polonium and astatine <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than gold, on account of their significant radioactivity. As of 5 April 2014, prices for small samples (up to 100 g) of silicon, antimony and tellurium, and graphite, aluminium and selenium, average around one third the cost of silver (US$1.5 per gram or about $45 an ounce). Boron, germanium and arsenic samples average about three-and-a-half times the cost of silver. Polonium is available for about $100 per microgram. Zalutsky and Pruszynski estimate a similar cost for producing astatine. Prices for the applicable elements traded as commodities tend to range from {{two to three times}} cheaper than the sample price (Ge), to nearly three thousand times cheaper (As).|$|E

25|$|Argentine long {{distance}} buses are fast, affordable and comfortable; {{they have become}} the primary means of long-distance travel since railway privatisations in the early 1990s greatly downsized Argentina's passenger rail service and plane tickets <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive.</b> Competing providers differ little on their time-honoured formula, offering three different services regarding the number of stops and type of seats: the Regular, Semi-cama (semi-bed), and Cama (bed), with Cama being similar to an airline's business class but the names vary. They may also be called Ejecutivo, Cama-vip, Cama-suite and some other names. Some services, usually the ones that <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive,</b> have also on-board dining, while others stop at restaurants by the road.

40|$|Cormorants hunt both benthic (sedentary) and pelagic (motile) prey {{but it is}} {{not known}} if the energy costs of {{foraging}} on these prey differ. We used respirometry to measure the costs of diving in double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) foraging either for sedentary (fish pieces) or motile (juvenile salmon) prey in a deep dive tank. Short dives for sedentary prey <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than dives of similar duration for motile prey (e. g. 20 % higher for a 10  s dive) whereas the reverse was true for long dives (i. e. long dives for motile prey <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than for sedentary prey). Across dives of all durations, the foraging phase of the dive <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> when the birds hunted motile prey, presumably due to pursuit costs. The period of descent in all the dives undertaken appears to have <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> when the birds foraged on sedentary prey, probably due to a higher swimming speed during this period...|$|R
