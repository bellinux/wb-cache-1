40|$|The {{analytic}} frame {{presented in}} this contribution seeks to enable careful, systematic and complex consideration of the various {{factors that contribute to}} language use in disciplinary settings across all grade levels. Three key concepts are presented: disciplinary awareness, disciplinary configurations, and writing universes, in which genres and practices interact. Describing the elements of these three concepts leads to a foregrounding of the tensions that student writers must negotiate as they produce language acts in different disciplinary contexts. The contribution bases its exploration of an analytic frame for language activity in the disciplines on insights developed through extended study of the work of <b>apprentice</b> <b>writers</b> and speakers in various settings, studying their interactions with scholastic and disciplinary life through their interaction with and representations of the objects and modes associated with different school sub-jects...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the contribution of}} Vivian Gussin Paley’s (1990; 1992) storytelling and story acting pedagogy to young children’s growing word and print awareness and their agency in early story authoring. Whilst many scholars have asserted and documented the value of Paley’s approach for children’s oral development and narrative comprehension (e. g. Cooper, 2009; Nicolopoulou, McDowell and Brockmeyer, 2006; Nicolopoulou, Cates, de Sá and Ilgaz, 2014), considerably less {{attention has been paid}} to its potential contribution to children’s early writing and their development as authors. In telling their tales to an adult, children watch as the adult scribes their spoken words and later they participate in bringing their own and others’ written tales to life through enactment. This close observation of adults’ writing, coupled with their active participation in the acting out of their peers’ stories were salient features of children’s participation in a recent UK based study of the approach upon which this chapter draws. In half the settings, children (aged 3 - 6 years old) initiated their own writing activities, authoring and co-authoring their own tales with friends and scribing their peers’ stories for later dramatisation (Cremin, Swann, Flewitt, Faulkner & Kucirkova, 2013). The agency and intentionality shown by these young authors was marked; they seized opportunities to write their own narratives and to scribe others’ tales and in the process learnt about writing through their authorial engagement. Anchoring the work within a sociocultural approach to learning (Lave and Wenger, 1991; Vygotsky, 1978) and literacy (Barton, Hamilton and Ivanic, 2000) the chapter begins by discussing children’s early authoring and the concepts of intentionality and agency from different ontological perspectives. It argues that children’s early authoring needs to be viewed as a socially situated act of meaning making, and recognizes that reading, writing and oral language develop simultaneously, not as discrete entities (Bloome, Carter Christian, Otto and Shuart-Faris, 2005; Rowe, 2003). Related research on the writing practices associated with Paley’s (1990) storytelling and story acting approach is also considered. The chapter then details the ethnographic data collection tools which enabled close documentation of the writing experiences of the children who participated in the UK instantiation of this approach (see Chapter 2 for more detail on the methodological approach). Data are drawn predominantly from two of the six settings involved in the study: a primary school and one of its feeder pre-schools, located within half a mile of each other in a semi-rural, suburban context in southern England. One class in each setting was involved, with children aged three-four, and four-five years old respectively. Specific, local enactments of learning-to-write practices that were evidenced during the use of the Helicopter Stories in these settings are examined. The chapter explores the ways in which storytelling and story acting enabled children to learn about writing and prompted some to scribe others’ tales spontaneously as well as author their own. Importantly, it argues that this playful pedagogic approach creates a possibility space for young <b>apprentice</b> <b>writers,</b> one which not only draws attention to the written word enabling children to observe its use in a meaningful context, but which may, in some settings, also serve to motivate their engagement in self-initiated and purposeful writing activities and become authors...|$|E

40|$|Esta pesquisa visa a estudar o exercício da função de autoria em aulas de escrita em inglês como Língua Estrangeira (LE) e o embasamento teóricometodológico articula transdisciplinarmente fundamentos da Lingüística Aplicada e da Análise do Discurso (AO), pressupondo uma concepção psicanalítica da subjetividade. A hipótese {{fundamental}} é que através da exercitação de voltas meta-enunciativas do dizer (retornos do dizer na cadeia enunciativa - Authier-Revuz, 1995), e da conscientização de efeitos de sentido por elas produzidos, estaremos modificando as condições de produção no discurso pedagógico em sala de aula de escrita em LE, propiciando a mobilização do sujeito no exercício de sua capacidade de autoria, isto é, levando os aprendizes a confrontarem-se com suas funções como enunciadores de pontos de vista que envolvem questões de responsabilidade no dizer. Trabalhamos com a noção de sujeito dividido, polifônico, não intencional, sem o domínio completo de seu discurso e com a concepção de linguagem como interdiscursividade heterogeneamente constituída (M. Pêcheux, 1990). Ao longo de um ano, foram acompanhadas as produções textuais de alunos universitários de segundo ano de Curso de Letras, na disciplina Prática Escrita. Uma classe foi dividida em dois grupos, levando-se em consideração o nível de desempenho dos participantes no primeiro semestre letivo. Os integrantes da proposta tomaram conhecimento de algumas voltas meta-enunciativas que julgamos mais favoráveis às suas produções escritas e a seu nível de competência lingüística. Interessava chegar a saber se, com mudanças nas condições de produção e a exercitação das citadas voltas, haveria um melhor desempenho na prática escrita dos enunciadores, isto é, se os aprendizes produziriam mais, ou melhor, ousariam mais em suas argumentações e,apesar de algumas limitações impostas pela materialidade lingüística, facilitar-se-ia o processo inscrição na segunda língua (Serrani-Infante, 1997). O resultado de nosso trabalho nos mostrou que há alterações significativas nq jogo de imagens e de formações imaginárias. O aluno passa a se ver e a ser visto como participante de uma proposta de mudança; o professor é também pesquisador; a própria sala de aula passa a ser um lugar de desafios e descobertas e, sobretudo, há mudanças gratificantes nas produções textuais dos aprendizes-enunciadores a partir da proposta, dando-nos a possibilidade de afirmar: a) que existem estratégias extremamente válidas que podem alterar de modo frutífero as produções escritas dos alunos e os próprios programas de ensino de escrita; b) que dentre tais estratégias, as voltas meta-enunciativas representam um caminho profícuo, motivador e inédito e dão possibilidades ao aprendiz de escrita em LE de se inscrever na língua estrangeira, desenvolvendo funções de autoria que propiciam a construção de um imaginário em que o enunciador é, cada vez mais, responsável pelo seu dizerThis research {{investigates the}} practice of authorship in writing English as a Foreign Language and the theoretical and methodological basis that provides a transdisciplinary articulation between the concepts of Applied Linguistics and those of Discourse Analysis; this presupposes a psychoanalytical conception of subjectívity. The fundamental hypothesis is that the use and practice of "boucles réflexives" (repetitions of previous affirmations in a linear chain of speech - Authier-Revuz, 1995), and {{an awareness of the}} effects of these devices on (the) meaning, will modify the conditions of production in pedagogic discourse in English language writing classes, facilitating the mobilization of the subject in exercising hislher capacity of authorship, i. e., providing the leamers with the opportunity of accepting their own functions as enunciators of points of view that involve the issue of responsibilíty for what is saído. We worked with the notion of a divided, polyphonic and unintentional subject, without complete control of hislher discourse and with the conception of language as interdiscourse heterogeneously constituted (M. Pêcheux, 1990). The textual production of second year university students enrolled in the discipline of Writing Practice Y'as collected for the period of one academic year. The class was divided into two subgroups according to class performance in the first semester. One subgroup was taught some basic "boucles" considered to be useful for written production and linguistic knowledge, to see whether these conditions of. production and {{the practice of}} "boucles" would lead to better compositions, whether the leamers would take the risk of producing more text, i. e., if they would accept the challenge and, despite their limited linguistic knowledge, whether these devices would facilitat the process of inscription in the second language (Serrani-Infante, 1997). The result of the research showed meaningful alterations in imaginary formations, with the students becoming participants in changes; the procedure situates the teacher as researcher, and the classroom as the location of challenges and discoveries. Modifications observed in the textual productions of the students 	(<b>apprentice</b> <b>writers)</b> were encouraging and suggested that:, a) it is possible to devise valid strategies to improve both written production of foreign language students and the curriculum for writing instruction; b) among these strategies are "boucles", which represent a new and exciting way of fumishing the apprentice writer with the possibility of inscribing himlherself in the foreign language, developing functions of authorship, that propitiate the construction of an imaginary in which the enunciator is more and more truly responsible for what he/shesays (for what is said).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (English)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. This {{thesis is}} {{premised on the}} notion, drawn mainly from a postcolonial {{perspective}} (which is subsumed under the poststructuralist {{as well as the}} postmodern), that Conrad's early writing reflects his abiding concern with how people construct their identities vis-a-vis the other/Other in contact zones on the periphery of empire far from the reach of social, racial and national identities that sustain them at home. It sets out to explore the problematic of race, culture, gender and identity in a selection of the writer's early works set mainly, but not exclusively, in the East, using the theoretical perspective of postcoloniality as a point of entry, nuanced by the configurations of spatiality which are factored into discourses about the other/Other. Predicated mainly on the theoretical constructs about culture and identity espoused by Homi Bhabha, Edward Said and Stuart Hall, this study proposes the idea of an in between "third space" for the interrogation of identity in Conrad's work. This postcolonial space, the central contribution of this thesis, frees his writings from the stranglehold of the Manichean paradigm in terms of which alterity or otherness is perceived. Based on the hypothesis that identities are never fixed but constantly in a state of performance, this project underwrites postcoloniality as a viable theoretical mode of intervention in Conrad's early works. The writer's early oeuvre yields richly to the contingency of our times in the early twenty-first century as issues of race, gender and identity remain contested terrain. This study adopts the position that Conrad stood both inside and outside Victorian cultural and ethical space, developing an ambivalent mode of representation which recuperated and simultaneously subverted the entrenched prejudices of his age. Conceived proleptically, the characters of Conrad's early phase, traditionally dismissed as those of an <b>apprentice</b> <b>writer,</b> pose a constant challenge to how we view alterity in our everyday lives.

40|$|Research on {{the texts}} of <b>apprentice</b> {{academic}} <b>writers</b> has found that they often exhibit weaknesses related to presenting an authoritative argumentative stance. This study rendered explicit linguistic resources for stance-taking and engaged advanced L 2 writers in exploring stance expressions in published research. Both linguistic and language learning theories informed this study. Seven Mandarin-speaking learners of English from fields in social sciences engaged in three writing sessions in which they consulted a concordance tool organized and created to present genre moves (Swales 1990; 2004) and engagement strategies (Martin & White, 2005) used by academic authors in research introductions. Analysis of their drafts showed improvement in rhetorical move structure and stance deployment after using the tool. They {{were found to be}} more accurate in applying and identifying stances that present assertive claims and factual statements than moderately assertive stance expressions that present expansive meanings. Despite some success in learning, close text analysis reveals that more help is needed to support students in deploying appropriately assertive claims, substantiating strong claims, and managing their stance expression across several clauses. Overall, this study found that an explicit approach to learning about authorial stance has the potential to raise L 2 writers’ consciousness and improve their writing...|$|R
50|$|Campbell {{was born}} on 25 December 1719 in Aberdeen (it is {{unlikely}} that there was much significance given to his birth date, since Scottish Calvinists, such as Campbell's father, Rev. Colin Campbell, despised both popish rituals and holidays). At the age of fifteen, Campbell attended Marischal College where he studied logic, metaphysics, pneumatology (philosophy of mind and/or spirit), ethics, and natural philosophy. After graduating with his M.A. in 1738, Campbell decided to study law and served as an <b>apprentice</b> to a <b>writer</b> to the Signet in Edinburgh. He began gravitating towards theology after attending lectures at the University of Edinburgh. After serving out his term as an apprentice, he returned to Aberdeen and enrolled at both King's and Marischal Colleges, University of Aberdeen as a student of divinity. Because of the tumultuous political landscape in Scotland (see Jacobite rising), Campbell's divinity examinations were delayed until 1746 when he received his licence to preach. Within two years, he received ordination at the parish of Banchory Ternan.|$|R

50|$|He {{was born}} 13 January 1766, at Berrywell, near Dunse, {{where his father}} was factor (estate manager) to Lord Douglas. While <b>apprenticed</b> to a <b>writer</b> to the signet in Edinburgh, young Ainslie in 1787 formed the {{acquaintance}} of Burns, and in May {{of the same year}} he made an excursion with the poet in Teviotdale and Berwickshire. Burns stayed some days at Berrywell. A sister of Ainslie, whom Burns met on this occasion, was the subject of the impromptu beginning with ‘Fair maid.’ Ainslie passed writer to the signet in 1789. He became an elder in the Church of Scotland, and was the author of two small religious works, ‘A Father's Gift to his Children,’ and ‘Reasons for the Hope that is in us.’ He also contributed to the ‘Edinburgh Magazine’ and other periodicals. His intimacy with Burns, and his genial manners, secured him a cordial welcome in the literary circles of Edinburgh. Hogg, who speaks of him as ‘honest Ainslie,’ mentions, as his one failing, constitutional sleepiness, the irresistibility of which Hogg, with characteristic egotism, illustrates by stating that he has ‘seen him fall fast asleep in the blue parlour at Ambrose's, with North in the chair and myself croupier.’ Fourteen letters of Burns to Ainslie are included in the poet's correspondence. According to W. S. Douglas (Works of Burns, ii. 188), the ballad, ‘Robin shure in Hairst,’ refers to a juvenile amour of Ainslie. Ainslie presented Sir Walter Scott with a manuscript copy of ‘Tam o' Shanter,’ which he had received from Burns at Ellisland. He died on 11 April 1838.|$|R
60|$|His family, {{consisting}} of several strapping deer-stalkers, still possessed the farm, {{by virtue of}} a long lease, for a trifling rent. There was no chance of any one buying it with such an encumbrance, and a transaction was entered into by the MacLarens, who, being desirous to emigrate to America, agreed to sell their lease to the creditors for L500, and to remove at the next term of Whitsunday. But whether they repented their bargain, or desired to make a better, or whether from a mere point of honour, the MacLarens declared they would not permit a summons of removal to be executed against them, which was necessary for the legal completion of the bargain. And such was the general impression that they were men capable of resisting the legal execution of warning by very effectual means, no king's messenger would execute the summons {{without the support of}} a military force. An escort of a sergeant and six men was obtained from a Highland regiment lying in Stirling; and the Author, then a <b>writer's</b> <b>apprentice,</b> equivalent to the honourable situation of an attorney's clerk, was invested with the superintendence of the expedition, with directions to see that the messenger discharged his duty fully, and that the gallant sergeant did not exceed his part by committing violence or plunder. And thus it happened, oddly enough, that the Author first entered the romantic scenery of Loch Katrine, of which he may perhaps say he has somewhat extended the reputation, riding in all the dignity of danger, with a front and rear guard, and loaded arms. The sergeant was absolutely a Highland Sergeant Kite, full of stories of Rob Roy and of himself, and a very good companion. We experienced no interruption whatever, and when we came to Invernenty, found the house deserted. We took up our quarters for the night, and used some of the victuals which we found there.
