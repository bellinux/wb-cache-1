5|$|This {{does not}} appear to be the entire story. Four {{modifications}} to the cytosine residues in human DNA have been reported.

5|$|Once {{secretory}} proteins are formed, the ER membrane separates {{them from}} the proteins that {{will remain in the}} cytosol. Secretory proteins depart from the ER enfolded in the membranes of vesicles that bud like bubbles from the transitional ER. These vesicles in transit {{to another part of the}} cell are called transport vesicles. An alternative mechanism for transport of lipids and proteins out of the ER <b>are</b> <b>through</b> lipid transfer proteins at regions called membrane contact sites where the ER becomes closely and stably associated with the membranes of other organelles, such as the plasma membrane, Golgi or lysosomes.|$|E
5|$|Similarly {{to other}} Brazilian public universities, admissions to {{undergraduate}} programs <b>are</b> <b>through</b> a comprehensive general examination, called vestibular. While other Brazilian public universities, specially federally managed ones, which use the National High School Exam (ENEM, in Portuguese Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio) as an entrance exam, Unicamp {{has its own}} national entrance exam applied yearly by its Vestibular Commission (COMVEST, in Portuguese Comissão Permanente para os Vestibulares) in two rounds. Generally, the first round happens in November and is a test composed of 90 multiple-choice general knowledge questions. Students applying to programs that require specific skills (such as music, architecture, dance, and others) must take a specific knowledge test even before the first phase.|$|E

The rest of the pathologic cases did not have exit wounds.|$|R
5|$|The A1 {{is one of}} London's main roads, {{providing}} {{a link to the}} M1 and the A1(M) motorways, and on to the Midlands, Northern England and Scotland. Despite this, its main use is to connect a number of neighbourhoods within north London; less than 5% of its vehicles <b>are</b> <b>through</b> traffic – the bulk is local. The roads along which the A1 route travels are the shared responsibility of the local boroughs, the Greater London Authority, and the British Government via the Department for Transport.|$|E

He and Adjeng fight, and Asmoro almost smothers Adjeng with a pillow before saying that they <b>are</b> <b>through.</b> As Adjeng lies on the bed, she recalls how her mother's lover raped her and how her mother murdered him. As the phone rings, Adjeng watches the people from her past going about life in a residential complex, smiles, and returns to writing.|$|E
5|$|The {{full-time}} side at {{the west}} end of the mezzanine has three street stairs. One leads to the northeast corner of Queens Boulevard and 59th Avenue, the closest to the mall. The other two staircases <b>are</b> <b>through</b> a long passageway to both southern corners of Queens Boulevard and Woodhaven Boulevard, acting as a pedestrian underpass outside of fare control. These staircases date back to the station's original opening. There is an entrance to the southeast corner of Woodhaven and Queens Boulevards that, {{as a result of the}} construction of the Long Island Expressway in the mid-1950s, leads only to two entrance ramps to the expressway, with no continuous sidewalk leading to the entrance.|$|E

5|$|The {{route of}} the A1 in London runs from the {{northern}} end of St. Martin's Le Grand in the City to Borehamwood in Hertfordshire, then travels on the northern fringe of Greater London to Bignell's Corner, where it crosses the M25 and becomes a motorway, designated A1(M), which alternates with the dual carriageway A1 as it continues to Edinburgh. The London section of the road passes through part of the City of London and three London boroughs: Islington, Haringey and Barnet. The A1 is one of London's main northern routes, providing a link to the M1 motorway and the A1(M) motorway, and on to the Midlands, Northern England and Scotland. It connects a number of major areas within London, and sections of it serve as the High Street for many of the now-joined villages that make up north London. Even though it is one of London's major roads, less than 5% of its approximate 60,000 vehicles a day <b>are</b> <b>through</b> traffic – the bulk is local.|$|E
