5|$|Honório Hermeto {{pursued a}} typical course open to 19th century Brazilians who became {{affluent}} through family connections and patronage: a judicial career, with expectations of entering politics. On 14 October 1826, {{he was named}} to a three-year term as juiz de fora (external judge) with jurisdiction over the three villages {{in the province of}} São Paulo. On 25 August 1828, Honório Hermeto left São Paulo upon being promoted to the post of auditor da marinha (<b>admiralty</b> <b>judge)</b> in Rio de Janeiro, the imperial capital located in the province of same name. His tenure in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro helped expand his connections. Emperor Dom PedroI appointed him ouvidor (superior judge) in late 1828 and desembargador (regional appeal judge) in 1829, an office Honório Hermeto held until his retirement in 1848.|$|E

[...] Under its terms, three positions were established for admiralty judges; Sullivan was appointed to be the <b>admiralty</b> <b>judge</b> for the eastern district (i.e. Maine) in addition to his other duties. [...] During his period of service in the provincial congress he drafted a large amount of legislation and was tireless in his activities on many committees.

50|$|The {{existence}} of a separate federal judiciary had been controversial during the debates over the ratification of the Constitution. Anti-Federalists had denounced the judicial power as a potential instrument of national tyranny. Indeed, of the ten amendments that eventually became the Bill of Rights, five (the fourth through the eighth) dealt primarily with judicial proceedings. Even after ratification, some opponents of a strong judiciary urged that the federal court system be limited to a Supreme Court and perhaps local <b>admiralty</b> <b>judges.</b> The Congress, however, decided {{to establish a system}} of federal trial courts with broader jurisdiction, thereby creating an arm for enforcement of national laws within each state.|$|R

2500|$|The {{scourge of}} the high seas pirates were cast as [...] "hostis humani generis", a term which was derived from Roman law. This title was {{rendered}} onto them in part by Sir Edward Coke in his effort to renovate existing legislation which dealt with piracy. As a consequence of this label, an <b>Admiralty</b> <b>Judge</b> by the name of Sir Charles Hedge would issue a sweeping proclamation which would grant the power of [...] "jurisdiction over all people – anywhere on earth – who interfered with English commerce." [...] The last great epoch of piracy gave rise to individuals who as a cohort were defined by, [...] "their almost universal rejection of national and religious authorities." ...|$|E

This is the way the government accounts get jammed, when Parliament wants to overhaul them. But I suppose young blood will have its run!

5|$|The {{failure of}} Operation Mascot {{convinced}} {{the commander of}} the Home Fleet, Admiral Sir Henry Moore, that the Fleet Air Arm's main strike aircraft, the Fairey Barracuda dive bomber, was not suited to operations against Kaafjord. As the dive bombers' slow speed gave the defenders of Kaafjord enough time to cover Tirpitz in a smoke screen between the time incoming raids were detected and their arrival over the target area, Moore concluded that further attacks using these aircraft would be futile. However, the <b>Admiralty</b> <b>judged</b> that repeatedly striking Kaafjord with Barracudas over a 48-hour period might wear down the German defences and exhaust the supply of fuel for Tirpitzs protective smoke generators. Consideration was also given to flying fast and long-ranged de Havilland Mosquito bombers off the carriers in an attempt to achieve surprise, but none of these land-based aircraft could be spared from supporting the Allied bombing of Germany.

50|$|Rolle's name is {{associated}} with a cause celebre of international law. Don Pantaleone Sá, a brother of the Portuguese ambassador, was arrested for a murder committed in an affray in the New Exchange in the Strand, London. The fact was undeniable, but the Don claimed the privilege of ex-territoriality, due to his {{being a member of the}} ambassador's household. The point was discussed by Rolle in consultation with two of his puisnes, two <b>admiralty</b> <b>judges</b> and two civilians, and on 16 January 1654 was decided against the Don. The decision was without precedent, for it could neither be denied that the Don was of the household of the ambassador, nor that the privilege of ex-territoriality had theretofore been understood to extend even to cases of murder. At the trial on 6 July 1654, over which Rolle presided, the prisoner was conceded a jury, half English half Portuguese, but was denied the assistance of counsel and was compelled to waive his privilege and plead to the indictment by a threat of peine forte et dure. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. The execution was carried out on Tower Hill on 10 July 1654.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was awarded}} the degree of Legum Doctor from Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1595 {{and spent the next}} four decades in private legal practice, until the {{outbreak}} of the First English Civil War in the early 1640s. In 1643 the sole <b>Admiralty</b> Court <b>judge,</b> Richard Zouch, was dismissed from office by Oliver Cromwell on suspicion of being a Royalist sympathiser. Cromwell's Lord High Admiral, Robert Rich, appointed Sammes as [...] "acting Judge" [...] in Zouch's place, and confirmed him as the permanent officeholder in 1644.|$|R
50|$|An {{exception}} to the ban on holding two offices at once {{seems to have been}} made for Gerald Comerford, who was appointed both Chief Justice of Munster and a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) shortly before his death in 1604. This was probably in consideration of his 20 years of loyal service to the Crown, his lack of a proper reward being a subject about which he had complained frequently over the years. There was apparently no objection to the Chief Justice holding a purely local judicial office at the same time: Henry Gosnold, through much of his long career, was also the <b>Admiralty</b> <b>judge</b> for Munster. This was at the time the only local section of the Irish Admiralty Court: the judge in Munster was a deputy to the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, acting in his role as the Irish <b>Admiralty</b> <b>judge.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Henry Gosnold, or Gosnell (c.1560 [...] - [...] c.1655) was an English-born {{lawyer who}} {{spent most of}} his very long life in Ireland.

He was also famous in his own lifetime for his wit: a few of his jokes still survive.|$|E
5000|$|He died in Dublin in June 1640 and {{was buried}} in the Church of St. John the Evangelist, Dublin.

2500|$|In English {{admiralty}} law, piracy {{was classified}} as petit treason during the medieval period, and offenders were accordingly liable to be drawn and quartered on conviction. Piracy was redefined as a felony {{during the reign of}} Henry VIII. In either case, piracy cases were cognizable in the courts of the Lord High Admiral. English <b>admiralty</b> vice-admiralty <b>judges</b> emphasized that [...] "neither Faith nor Oath is to be kept" [...] with pirates; i.e. contracts with pirates and oaths sworn to them were not legally binding. Pirates were legally subject to summary execution by their captors if captured in battle. In practice, instances of summary justice and annulment of oaths and contracts involving pirates do not appear to have been common.|$|R
