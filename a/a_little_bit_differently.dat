Working with requirements is not an easy thing and their poor understanding and incorrect implementation may adversely affect the project. Dissatisfaction arises at the both sides of project because customers do not get what they have wanted and development team does worthless and unnecessary work from their point of view. Problems with requirements and with setting up the right processes to deal with them are the area of Requirements Management. Over the years there was defined a few best practices within this scope. This thesis describes some basic techniques, methods and rules. There is also a requirements splitting into five types.

40|$|Our {{lives would}} not be what they are today without animals. From the food we eat, to the clothes we wear, animals provide {{tangible}} evidence of their importance every day. But more than that, animals have shaped {{who we are and}} what we believe. Often in ways we don 2 ̆ 7 t see. That 2 ̆ 7 s what inspired me to write Being Human. This work began as an examination of how humans have altered animals to better match our imaginations and ideals, and too, the way these animals have irrecoverably altered how we live and look at the world. Consider, for example, that before they became physically useful to us in providing meat or skills or companionship, animals were central figures in our stories, mythologies, and religions. All the while, of course, these animals remained both ignorant and at the mercy of whatever we imagined [...] or needed [...] them to be. And what does all of this say about us? What can we learn about ourselves from looking at animals, and more specifically, looking at the way we treat them? In a society where animal flesh comes to us freshly packed and cleanly saran-wrapped, and pets are treated as members of our families, we tend to look at animals as one thing or another. A farm pig is not a companion animal, any more than a cat is a meal-in-waiting. At least not in our culture. We generally see what 2 ̆ 7 s convenient or desirable and when things get messy or complicated, we tend to look away. In so doing, we miss the opportunity to clearly see who we really are, what we 2 ̆ 7 re capable of, and what, if anything, we might want to change as a result. I chose four specific animals that show us different sides of ourselves. These beings are both familiar and strange, part of our everyday lives but often only found on the periphery. Each animal symbolizes one of four categories: food, pest, worker and pet. And each connects to a human need: pigs with consumption, pigeons with communication, horses with control and cats with companionship. They are arranged in this order to reflect the deepening complexity of their respective human needs [...] from the simplest, the need to eat, to the most complex, the need for companionship. (Arguably, control can be considered the most complex, however I chose companionship as the culminating need because it inherently involves all of the other three.) I hope if I accomplish only one thing, it is this: after reading, you see these animals [...] and your relationship to them [...] <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>differently</b> than before...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to {{creating}} a technique for calculating power characteristics of the screws with constant and variable step for the centrifugal pumps. The technique feature is that the reverse currents, which are observed in screws working at low flow, are numerically taken into account. The paper presents a diagram of the stream in the screw with flow to the network Q= 0, and the static pressure of the screw in this mode is computed according to reverse current parameters. Maximum flow of screw is determined from the known formulas. When calculating the power characteristics and computing the overall efficiency of the screw, {{for the first time}} a volumetric efficiency of the screw is introduced. It is defined as a ratio between the flow into the network and the sum of the reverse current flows and a flow into the network. This approach allowed us to determine the efficiency of the screw over the entire range of flows. A comparison of experimental characteristics of the constant step screw with those of calculated by the proposed technique shows their good agreement. The technique is also used in calculating characteristics of the variable step screws. The variable step screw is considered as a screw consisting of two screws with a smooth transition of the blades from the inlet to the outlet. Screws in which the step at the inlet is less than that of at the outlet as well as screws with the step at the inlet being more than that of at the outlet were investigated. It is shown that a pressure of the screw with zero step and the value of the reverse currents depend only on the parameters of the input section of the screw, and the maximum flow, if the step at the inlet is more than the step at the outlet, is determined by the parameters of the output part of the screw. Otherwise, the maximum flow is determined <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>differently.</b> The paper compares experimental characteristics with characteristics calculated by the technique for variable step screws, thereby demonstrating good compliance. Results of the research allowed us to draw the following conclusions. 1. Taking into account the reverse currents enabled us to refine the calculation of power characteristics of the constant and variable step screws over the entire range of flows. 2. A program developed on the basis of the proposed technique enables us to calculate screw characteristics from their geometrical parameters and frequency of rotation. This is very convenient when performing the design calculations of the flow part of the screwcentrifugal pump. 3. If the screw-set pump is intended for use in the continuous flow mode, it is advisable to set either constant step screws S 1 =S 2 or variable step screw S 1 S 2. </p...|$|E
