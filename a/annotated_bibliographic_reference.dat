40|$|Taeniotes farinosus (Linnaeus, 1758) is {{a species}} that has been {{confused}} with other species {{during the past two}} centuries. In this work we demonstrate that Taeniotes farinosus sensu auctorum is not the species described by Linnaeus and designate a lectotype to establish its identity. Taeniotes pulverulentus (Olivier, 1790), currently synonymous with T. farinosus, is revalidated. Taeniotes guttullaris Schwarzer, 1929 and T parafarinosus Breuning, 1971 are junior synonyms of T. pulverulentus; Lamia subocellata Olivier, 1792 (= Taeniotes subocellatus) is a junior synonym of Cerambyx farinosus (= T farinosus). Additionally we monnei, a new species from Brazil and Argentina, is described and figured.

When built using open standards, GWS permits users to dynamically access, exchange, deliver, and process geospatial data and products on the World Wide Web, no matter what platform or protocol is used. Standards/specifications pertaining to geospatial ontologies, geospatial Web services and interoperability are discussed in this bibliography. Finally, a selected, <b>annotated</b> list of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>references</b> by experts in the field is presented.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{repeated}} mistakes in <b>bibliographic</b> <b>references,</b> scientists are interested in reference managers. Currently, there are only few studies which concentrate on the quality evaluation of the <b>bibliographic</b> <b>references</b> generated by these applications. In this research, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>references</b> of online and printed articles, books, contributions to books and web resources generated from the Citace PRO, EndNote, Mendeley, RefWorks and Zotero reference managers with briefly made references according to the citation styles ACS, APA, ASA, ČSN ISO 690, JAMA, MLA and NLM were compared. During the comparison, {{it was found that}} no reference manager is able to generate all references in the correct way. The best results were detected in Mendeley which had the total fewest number of mistakes and the fewest number of mistakes for 3 citation styles and in Zotero which had the second total least number of mistakes and the total fewest number of mistakes for 4 citation styles. On the other hand, Citace PRO revealed the most mistakes for 5 citations style, EndNote for 2 citation styles and RefWorks for 1 citation style. All reference managers had problems with generating various data in <b>bibliographic</b> <b>references.</b> It was found that several mistakes were caused by the technical restrictions of the reference managers while other mistakes were caused by the wrong setting of the citation formats. With respect to similar functions of the tested reference managers and the number of mistakes in generated references, Zotero and Mendeley proved to be the most suitable managers...|$|R
