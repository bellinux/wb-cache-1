40|$|The {{impact of}} the minimum wage {{increase}} on the part-time/full-time employment ratio (PTFT) is re-examined. Contrary to some previous findings, strong evidence is found of the substitution effect that if the relative wage (the ratio of the minimum wage to the <b>average</b> <b>hourly</b> <b>earning</b> in the private sector) rises, PTFT decreases. The linear and logarithmic forms can be rejected. The partial adjustment process describes the lag response better. Real GDP growth {{is found to be}} insignificant and may be proxied by the unemployment rate for experienced workers. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} problem of maximizing the <b>average</b> <b>hourly</b> profit <b>earned</b> by a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) {{provider}} who runs a software service {{on behalf of a}} customer using servers rented from an Infrastructureas-a-Service (IaaS) provider. The SaaS provider earns a fee per successful transaction and incurs costs proportional to the number of server-hours it uses. A number of resource allocation policies for this or similar problems have been proposed in previous work. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, these policies have not been comparatively evaluated in a cloud environment. This paper reports on an empirical evaluation of three policies using a replica of Wikipedia deployed on the Amazon EC 2 cloud. Experimental results show that a policy based on a solution to an optimization problem derived from the SaaS provider’s utility function outperforms well-known heuristics that have been proposed for similar problems. It is also shown that all three policies outperform a “reactive ” allocation approach based on Amazon’s auto-scaling feature. I...|$|R

40|$|The carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) is dominant among major traffic emitted pollutants such as respirable {{suspended particulate matter}} (RSPM), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), volatile organic carbons(VOCs) and ozone (O 3) etc. It is generated by automobiles due to incomplete combustion of the fuel. The vehicles that queue up at an intersection {{spend more time in}} idle driving mode generating more pollutant leading to higher pollutant concentrations. Therefore, the trends of <b>average</b> <b>hourly</b> CO concentrations at various locations of congested roadways intersection have been investigated. The four approach roads making intersection have been selected for the present study. CO monitoring has been carried out at 2 selected locations of each approach road. The CO concentration has been monitored from 8 : 00 AM to 8 : 00 PM at each location using portable online CO monitor. The <b>average</b> <b>hourly</b> CO concentrations data have been analyzed using MS excel spread sheet for each approach road. The <b>average</b> <b>hourly</b> concentration of monitored CO concentration at all receptors locations shows two peak CO concentration values (i. e., the morning peak and evening peak) throughout the monitoring programme (March to May, 2011). The comparison of monitored values of <b>average</b> 1 <b>hourly</b> CO concentration levels as well as 8 <b>hourly</b> <b>average</b> concentration levels of CO showed non compliance with the prescribed standards (4000 µg/m 3 <b>average</b> <b>hourly</b> and 2000 µg/m 3 <b>average</b> 8 <b>hourly</b> CO concentration).

40|$|Wind-driven rain (WDR) {{is the one}} of {{the main}} {{moisture}} sources for building facades. It {{is an important factor in}} the dry and wet deposition of pollutants, facade surface soiling and facade erosion. WDR calculations require data records of wind speed, wind direction and horizontal rainfall intensity as input. Most meteorological datasets contain at best arithmetically <b>averaged</b> <b>hourly</b> wind and rain data. Their use is common practice in WDR calculations. As an example, existing WDR standards request at best hourly data. This paper however demonstrates that the use of such data can yield (very) large errors in the calculated WDR amounts and intensities. The reason is that arithmetic <b>averaging</b> on an <b>hourly</b> basis generally causes an important loss of information about the co-occurrence of wind and rain. An improved data averaging technique for wind and rain data is proposed that respects this co-occurrence by applying appropriate weighting factors in the averaging procedure. The performance of this technique is evaluated by WDR calculations on buildings in three cities with different climates. While arithmetically <b>averaged</b> <b>hourly</b> data yield large underestimation errors (Eindhoven, The Netherlands: 11 %, Bloomington, USA: 45 %, Grahamstown, South Africa: 31 %), the improved averaging technique provides very good results (errors: 0 %, 4 %, 3 %, respectively). In conclusion, WDR calculations should not be performed with arithmetically <b>averaged</b> <b>hourly</b> data. Instead, either high-resolution data (e. g. 10 -minute data) or hourly data that have been obtained with the proposed weighted averaging technique should be used...|$|R

40|$|The gender pay gap exists universally but {{its size}} might vary {{from one country}} to another. A variety of factors cause the gender pay gap but two {{important}} ones are occupational segregation and gender discrimination in labour markets. It is common to observe gender differences by occupations and industries. These differences imply large variations in the jobs worked by women and men. For instance, female workers are in general more likely to be in clerical and service occupations or professional services such as education and training. Gender discrimination occurs when people who provide labour market services and are equally productive are treated unequally because of gender. Inequality means that these people receive different wages for the same work or face different demands for their labour services at a given wage. Many economic theories suggest that labour market discrimination not only lowers the wages of the disadvantaged group but also raises the wages of the advantaged group. 1 The figure presents the ratio of <b>average</b> <b>hourly</b> female wages to average male wages over a working lifetime. The hourly wage is adjusted for years of schooling, geographical locations (e. g., provinces or urban/rural) and race.

Occupations in STEM reflect lower educational levels and wages in these countries because of specifics in these countries’ histories (see OECD (2012)). If Eastern European countries are excluded, the data set shows the expected right-skewed wage distribution with higher wages, on average, for occupations in STEM. Additionally, higher levels of education show higher levels of wages than lower and middle levels of education.|$|R
