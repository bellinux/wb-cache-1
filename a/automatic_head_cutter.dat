40|$|Shapes {{different}} from the traditional ones have been proposed for face worm gears and for conical and cylindrical worms that mesh with them. The proposed shapes {{are based on the}} concept of generating a face worm gear surface by use of a tilted <b>head</b> <b>cutter</b> instead of by the traditional use of a hob. (As used here, <b>head</b> <b>cutter</b> is also meant to signify, alternatively, a head grinding tool.) The gear-surface-generation equipment would be similar to that used for generation of spiral bevel and hypoid gears. In comparison with the corresponding traditional hob, a tilted <b>head</b> <b>cutter</b> according to the proposal would be larger, could be fabricated with greater precision, and would enable the generation of gear surfaces with greater precision and greater productivity. A face worm gear would be generated (see figure) by use of a tilted <b>head</b> <b>cutter,</b> the blades or grinding surfaces of which would have straight-line profiles. The tilt of the <b>head</b> <b>cutter</b> would prevent interference with teeth adjacent to the groove being cut or ground. A worm to mesh with the face worm gear would be generated by use of a tilted <b>head</b> <b>cutter</b> mounted on the cradle of a generating machine. The blades or grinding surfaces of the <b>head</b> <b>cutter</b> would have a parabolic profile and would deviate from the straight-line profiles of the <b>head</b> <b>cutter</b> for the face worm gear. The shortest distance between the worm and the cradle would follow a parabolic function during the cycle of meshing in the generating process to provide a parabolic function of transmission errors to the gear drive. The small mismatch between the profiles of the face-worm-gear and worm <b>head</b> <b>cutters</b> would make it possible to localize the bearing contact in the worm gear drive. The parabolic function of transmission errors could absorb discontinuous linear functions of transmission errors caused by errors of alignment; this could afford a significant benefit, in that such errors are main sources of noise and vibration in gear drives. The main advantage of using tilted <b>head</b> <b>cutters</b> is that cutting speeds are independent of the shape-generation processes, making it possible to choose cutting speeds that are optimum with respect to requirements to minimize temperatures and deformations during fabrication and improve the quality of finished parts...|$|R

A main dif-ficulty of such a design is determining the length and diameter of the shaft that might be undercut by the <b>head</b> <b>cutter</b> during gear tooth generation.

40|$|Offshore {{activities}} in ice-covered waters are gaining increased attention nowadays. Such operations as crew change, lifting, installation, drilling, etc. may require keeping the vessel {{on a fixed}} location during long time periods. The use of dynamic positioning systems appears therefore to be an attractive solution, being much more flexible than mooring operations. However, the ice environment is significantly different from open water conditions. As known from several full-scale experiments, systems developed for open water purpose do not answer all ice challenges. Nevertheless, recent R&D projects have demonstrated the feasibility of DP in ice. During the DYPIC project, a European collaborative program, large amount of ice model basin tests have been performed at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin. Those tests have not only spotlighted stationkeeping possibilities under certain challenging conditions, but have also brought out several important aspects of ice forces on the hull. In this paper, the DYPIC outcomes are used to build an <b>automatic</b> <b>heading</b> control system for a DP vessel {{in order to improve}} its stationkeeping abilities in ice. The system with <b>automatic</b> <b>heading</b> is then compared in a numerical simulation framework to a system with fixed heading. The results show that in selected scenarios the DP system with <b>automatic</b> <b>heading</b> control outperforms clearly the one with fixed heading control. Specifically, the ice loads and the power consumption are reduced considerably. 1...|$|R
