5|$|The {{trial judge}} has an {{obligation}} to ensure <b>an</b> <b>impartial</b> jury, especially vis-a-vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as jury selection (including voir dire and for-cause challenges), jury sequestration, and jury instructions. For example, this may require the court to permit voir dire {{on the subject of the}} juror's potential racial prejudice. In some circumstances, the Sixth Amendment even requires the trial judge to grant a defendant's change of venue motion if <b>an</b> <b>impartial</b> jury cannot be obtained otherwise.|$|E

Golda Meir finally agreed to the formation of the Agranat Commission towards the end of November 1973. War veterans and members of the public attacked Meir and Moshe Dayan, while Israeli generals criticised one another's performance.|$|E
5|$|Atrus {{calls the}} Stranger {{to his home}} in Tomahna to request his friend's assistance. Atrus is the writer of special books, which serve as links to worlds known as Ages. Twenty years earlier, his two sons, Sirrus and Achenar, {{destroyed}} his library on Myst and trapped their parents in order to plunder the wealth of Atrus' Ages. The Stranger's intervention saved Atrus, who had imprisoned his sons via traps intended for thieves. Atrus' wife Catherine hopes that, after twenty years, they have finally repented for their crimes. Atrus is not as sure his sons have reformed, and so wishes the Stranger to act as <b>an</b> <b>impartial</b> judge. After being knocked unconscious by an explosion, the Stranger realizes that Yeesha, Atrus' daughter, has disappeared.|$|E

5|$|Smith said he {{understood}} this would irk the British, but {{insisted that he}} and his government were no longer willing to wait. He had repeatedly offered to respect the judgement of <b>an</b> <b>impartial</b> arbitration team, he reminded Johnston, but the British had shot this idea down each time. He therefore felt compelled to follow the advice given by his own legal team, which was that the appointment was legitimate. His government would not accept a lesser appointment in Lisbon than in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques. He dismissed Johnston's threat to expel the Rhodesian representatives in West Germany, Japan and America; relations with Portugal and South Africa were far more important, he said, as they were Rhodesia's two closest neighbours geographically.|$|E
5|$|In late March 1889, {{just as the}} izinDuna {{were about}} to leave London, Rhodes arrived to make the {{amalgamation}} with Cawston and Gifford official. To the amalgamators' dismay, the Colonial Office had received protests against the Rudd Concession {{from a number of}} London businessmen and humanitarian societies, and had resolved that it could not sanction the concession because of its equivocal nature, as well as the fact that Lobengula had announced its suspension. Rhodes was originally angry with Maund, accusing him of responsibility for this, but eventually accepted that it was not Maund's fault. Rhodes told Maund to go back to Bulawayo, to pose as <b>an</b> <b>impartial</b> adviser, and to try to sway the king back in favour of the concession; as an added contingency, he told Maund to secure as many new subconcessions as he could.|$|E
5|$|Worsening {{economic}} conditions had put further pressure on industrial relations, with unemployment rising and employers seeking to cut costs. Strikes of sugar mill workers in 1927, waterside workers in 1928, and then transport and timber industry workers in 1929 continued to disrupt economic operations. The worst came with ongoing disputes between miners and mine owners on the coalfields of New South Wales had culminated in riots and lockouts in 1929, and intervention by the Bruce government {{failed to produce}} a settlement. Notably, in March 1929 Newcastle-based mine owner John Brown locked out workers from his mines at Pelaw Main and Richmond Main to try to force acceptance of lower wages. Attorney-General John Latham pursued legal action against Brown for illegally using coercive industrial tactics, but Bruce intervened to stop the prosecution, believing the case to be doubtful and that dropping it would give the government a chance to negotiate {{an end to the}} dispute. The mine-owners refused to accede to government-brokered negotiations anyway, and the government was seen to have been siding with rich businesses and applying double standards, undermining Bruce's own credibility as <b>an</b> <b>impartial</b> leader and law-and-order prime minister.|$|E

5|$|In the {{original}} version, the Enterprise visits Naterra and meets the planet's leader, Zxolar, who {{is concerned that}} Captain Kirk is an alien called Komether who is due to return within twenty days to destroy their world. Zxolar suddenly collapses and Doctor McCoy tries to help him but an energy surrounds the doctor's head and he runs at a wall and disappears. The landing party search for McCoy {{but to no avail}} and Zxolar is beamed to the Enterprise. Doctor Chapel attempts to help him but the energy appears around her and she passes out. Xon and Kirk discuss the energy and realize it wants Zxolar to die as it has attacked anyone who helps him. The pair beam back down the planet to investigate the palace they met Zxolar in and discover an archive which shows them {{the original}} agreement made by six philosophers, including a much younger Zxolar, and Komether a thousand years earlier. They note one of the philosophers is Zxolar and the Komether is the energy being which attacked the two doctors. As in the later version used on Star Trek: The Next Generation, the agreement was that the being would correct the pollution of the planet in return for ownership of the planet a thousand years later. Xon and Kirk decide to move Zxolan to a life support table and ask for other volunteers as it is apparent that Komether will attack them as they attempt to save him. Scotty, Sulu and Chekov all volunteer as well, and the alien disables each of them as they move Zxolar. It is only because of Xon's strength as he is being attacked that they manage to attach Zxolar to a life support machine and his life signs immediately improve. Zxolar tells Kirk about the contract, who retrieves it from the planet's surface and challenges it. Komethar appears and agrees to a trial with the Enterprises computer acting as <b>an</b> <b>impartial</b> judge. Kirk realises that Komethar was created by the six philosophers and so as the last remaining, Zxolar is in control of it. Zxolar manages to defeat the creature using his will and releases the stunned crewmen. He finds that McCoy was trapped in the wall itself and releases him too, the Enterprise departing shortly thereafter.|$|E

25|$|<b>An</b> <b>impartial</b> game is one where, {{at every}} {{position}} of the game, the same moves are available to both players. For instance, Nim is impartial, as any set of objects that can be removed by one player can be removed by the other. However, domineering is not impartial, because one player places horizontal dominoes and the other places vertical ones. Likewise Checkers is not impartial, since the players own different colored pieces. For any ordinal number, one can define <b>an</b> <b>impartial</b> game generalizing Nim in which, on each move, either player may replace the number with any smaller ordinal number; the games defined in this way are known as nimbers. The Sprague–Grundy theorem states that every impartial game is equivalent to a nimber.|$|E
