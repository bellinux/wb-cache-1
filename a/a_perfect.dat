5|$|Only {{four days}} before Galarraga's near-perfect outing, Roy Halladay pitched <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> game for the Philadelphia Phillies, and just twenty days prior to that, Dallas Braden threw <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> game for the Oakland Athletics. Halladay's and Braden's perfect games {{had been the first}} pair of such games to occur in the same season during the modern era, let alone the same month.

The Terps secured an Orange Bowl rematch against first-ranked Oklahoma and a chance to avenge their defeat in 1953. However, the Sooners beat them again, 20–6, and they finished the postseason with a 10–1 record.|$|E

5|$|This {{would have}} also {{marked the first}} perfect game in the Tigers' 110-year history. The 83 pitches thrown before the blown call {{would have been the}} fewest pitches in <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> game since 1908. Galarraga's near-perfect game was the first such game since Mike Mussina's bid for <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> game on September 2, 2001, which was broken up by 27th batter Carl Everett. It was also the third time for a Tigers pitcher to come so close to <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> game, as Milt Wilcox also missed getting the 27th {{straight}} batter out on April 15, 1983, and Tommy Bridges missed the 27th batter on August 5, 1932.|$|E
5|$|A year later, David Cone, {{one of the}} {{key players}} in the then-most recent Yankee dynasty, started for the Red Sox against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium to the sound of a {{standing}} ovation despite playing for the arch-rival Red Sox. It marked Cone's first return to Yankee Stadium since leaving the team. Cone would later take part in another notable game later that year when he went up against newly acquired Yankee pitcher Mike Mussina. Mussina had come within one strike of pitching <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> game against the Red Sox at Fenway Park. Carl Everett's 9th-inning two-out, two-strike single was the only baserunner allowed by Mussina in a 1–0 Yankee win. Coincidentally, David Cone was the last Yankee pitcher to throw <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> game, in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. <b>A</b> <b>perfect</b> duty always holds true—there is <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E
