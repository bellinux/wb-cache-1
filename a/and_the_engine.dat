5|$|Each engine {{had its own}} intake <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{nacelles}} were {{paired with}} a splitter plate between them to minimise adverse behaviour of one powerplant influencing the other. Only above Mach 1.6 was an engine surge likely to affect the adjacent engine.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Rolls-Royce {{started work}} on modifying some Merlins which were later {{to be used}} in British MTBs, MGBs, and RAF Air-Sea Rescue Launches. For these the superchargers were {{modified}} single-stage units <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was re-engineered for use in a marine environment. Some 70 engines were converted before priority was given to producing aero engines.|$|E
5|$|In August 2015, {{members of}} the Dutch sport-diving club Duikteam Zeester dove on {{the wreck of the}} Mainz and {{retrieved}} a variety of prosaic artifacts, including a sextant <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> telegraph. Their actions provoked criticism from German sources, who noted that the wreck was a war grave containing the remains of 89 crew members and thus should not be disturbed. The German Federal Police were investigating the incident.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next few years, Bloom spent some £16,000 {{restoring}} the locomotive (along with some 20,000 man hours) and in May 1974 it was restored to steam once more. Unfortunately, as 1976 progressed it was discovered that No. 46233 would require a new firebox tubeplate at a projected cost of £12,000. Bloom was not prepared to spend further money at this time <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> became a static exhibit at Bressingham.|$|E
5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Captain Salmond rushed on {{deck and}} ordered the anchor to be dropped, the quarter-boats to be lowered, and a turn astern to be given by the engines. However, as the ship backed off the rock, the sea rushed into the large hole made by the {{collision}} and the ship struck again, buckling the plates of the forward bilge and ripping open the bulkheads. Shortly, the forward compartments <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> rooms were flooded, and over 100 soldiers were drowned in their berths.|$|E
60|$|After an hour's {{steaming}} the Russian launches came to {{the immediate}} neighbourhood of <b>the</b> enemy's flotilla, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> were slowed.|$|R
5000|$|The IVF6 {{was tested}} on F-BXAS, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> were {{retained}} [...] during that aircraft's {{time as a}} company transport. This version of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> output 10.490 kN of thrust at takeoff power.|$|R
50|$|In a {{marketing}} coup for both <b>the</b> brewer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> manufacturer, King George III and Queen Charlotte visited the brewery on 24 May 1787. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> remained in service for 102 years, until 1887.|$|R
5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight laminar flow wings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
5|$|During late 1969, Phase IV sensors {{began to}} be {{deployed}} in-theater. These had {{a greater number of}} available communications channels, which allowed the seeding of a larger sensor field without fear of signal interference. By 1971–1972 a new sensor with a commandable microphone (COMMMIKE III) and another with a vehicle ignition detector (EDET III, which could detect the unshielded ignition systems of gasoline engines) were introduced. In 1972 U.S. dollars the ADSID cost $619.00, the ACOUSID $1,452.00, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> detector $2,997.00. During the life of the operation approximately 20,000 sensors were deployed in Laos.|$|E
5|$|In October 1990, while {{flying a}} {{training}} route in eastern Colorado, B-1B (s/n 86-0128) from the 384th Bomb Wing, 28th Bomb Squadron, McConnell AFB, experienced an explosion as the engines reached full power without afterburners. Fire on the aircraft's left was spotted. The #1 engine {{was shut down}} and its fire extinguisher was activated. The accident investigation determined that the engine had suffered catastrophic failure, engine blades had cut through the engine mounts <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> became detached from the aircraft.|$|E

50|$|The {{recovery}} {{continued on}} 2 August using <b>the</b> DSV Norskald, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines,</b> main rotor, <b>and</b> transmission were located and raised on 5 August.|$|R
60|$|Soon after that, {{the fire}} was {{completely}} extinguished, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>and</b> men returned to their several stations, leaving London once again in comparative repose.|$|R
5|$|In many respects, the YF-22s were {{different}} from production F-22s. Contrary to the F-117 Nighthawk, which was initially difficult to control because of small vertical stabilizers, Lockheed over-specified the fin area on its YF-22. Therefore, the company reduced the size of those on F-22s by 20–30 percent. Lockheed recontoured {{the shape of the}} wing and stabilator trailing edges to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics; the wing and stabilitor sweep was reduced by 6° from 48°. Finally, to improve pilot visibility, the canopy was moved forward 7inches (178mm), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> intakes were moved rearward 14inches (356mm).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Boeing {{selected}} the CFM56-3 to exclusively power the Boeing 737-300 variant. The 737 wings were {{closer to the}} ground than previous applications for the CFM56, necessitating several modifications to the engine. The fan diameter was reduced, which reduced the bypass ratio, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> accessory gearbox was moved {{from the bottom of}} the engine (the 6o'clock position) to the 9o'clock position, giving the engine nacelle its distinctive flat-bottomed shape. The overall thrust was also reduced, from , mostly due to the reduction in bypass ratio.|$|E
5|$|To {{address the}} {{relatively}} poor {{reception of the}} preceding AU series, the BA series was heavily updated for launch in September 2002—the same time as its biggest rival, the Holden Commodore (VY). It featured a substantially revised and more conservative exterior styling, with every panel new except for the carry-over door skins. Interiors, too, were substantially revised, while mechanically, a new independent rear suspension setup was fitted to all sedan derivatives <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and transmissions received extensive upgrades. In October 2004, Ford introduced a Mark II update, bringing subtle styling and mechanical changes, and in October 2005, replaced the BA with the BF.|$|E
50|$|The 1960s Aston Martin {{vehicles}} had the bodywork {{styled by}} Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera of Milan in Italy, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> developed by Tadek Marek (from Poland).|$|R
50|$|The initial {{pre-production}} version, differing {{slightly from}} the Yak-38. It weighed only 6650 kg compared to the Yak-38's 7370 kg <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> were slightly less powerful.|$|R
50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{had been}} started <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{temperature}} {{had risen to}} the minimum operating level, the external air hose and connectors were removed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> resonant design kept it firing without any further need for the electrical ignition system, which was used only to ignite <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> when starting.|$|R
5|$|Alan Brigman was the {{technical}} director and co-producer. He and Mike Woodroffe developed a game creation system, Adventure Graphic Operating System (AGOS) II, which facilitated {{the development of}} Simon the Sorcerer and enabled the team {{to focus on the}} gameplay and story without worrying about {{the technical}} aspects. The system allowed the developers to input text commands on a separate monitor, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> could be ported to other platforms. Other features of the engine included translating actions performed by the mouse into text commands (a sentence parser carries them out), the loading of data as-needed, and functions could be implemented by the simple addition of commands. The game was built as a database, which contained tables for rooms and objects. These tables contained animation code and information about what is supposed to happen. Alan Cox was also involved {{in the development of the}} AGOS engine, which is based on AberMUD.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} spacecraft, the Gemini Lunar Surface Survival Shelter, {{was designed}} to be sent to the Moon ahead of an Apollo mission. It would have landed close to the planned Apollo landing site, and if the Apollo Lunar Module's ascent stage failed to ignite, the crew would have performed an EVA to transfer to the LSSS. The shelter was not designed to take off again after landing, so an LSRS or another Apollo mission would then be sent to collect the crew, whilst the Command Module Pilot of the original Apollo mission would have returned to Earth alone aboard his spacecraft. It consisted of a Gemini Reentry Module, which would have housed the astronauts whilst they awaited rescue, and a descent stage containing life support systems, consumables, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and propellant used to land the spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|As August ended, {{production}} {{continued to}} slip farther behind schedule. Koenig learned {{that rather than}} being released in 14 days after his scenes were completed, his last day would be on October 26—eight weeks later than expected. The next bridge scenes to be filmed after the wormhole sequence, Enterprises approach to V'Ger and the machine's resulting attack, were postponed for two weeks so that the special effects for the scene could be planned and implemented, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> room scenes could be shot. Chekov's burns sustained in V'Ger's attack were difficult to film; though the incident took only minutes on film, Weldon spent hours preparing the effect. A piece of aluminum foil was placed around Koenig's arm, covered by a protective pad and then hidden by the uniform sleeve. Weldon prepared an ammonia and acetic acid solution that was touched to Koenig's sleeve, causing it to smoke. Difficulties resulted in the scene being shot ten times; it was especially uncomfortable for the actor, whose arm was slightly burned {{when some of the}} solution leaked through to his arm.|$|E
5000|$|Mercedes {{needed a}} compact 6 {{cylinder}} for their vans and asked Volkswagen {{if they could}} use <b>the</b> VR6 Golf/Jetta <b>engine.</b> An agreement was reached <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> were sold semi completed to MB. Basically only <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> cover <b>and</b> aircleaner housing is by MB.|$|R
50|$|The Agnes is a sportier {{version of}} the Mystar. The new model was {{introduced}} in May 2007. <b>The</b> interior <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> are <b>the</b> same as in the Mystar.|$|R
5000|$|Air {{resistance}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> {{inability to}} keep a high specific impulse at a fast burn rate are why all the propellant is not used as fast as possible.|$|R
5|$|Frankie dies next at a drive-through, when {{a runaway}} truck crashes {{into the back}} of Kevin's truck <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> fan blows out. The next day, Wendy and Kevin try to save Lewis at the gym; he tells them that he does not believe them shortly before two weights from the weight {{training}} machine he is using swing down and decapitate him. Ian and Erin are working at a hardware store; Wendy saves Ian from being impaled by falling planks of wood, causing Death to skip him and move onto Erin, who falls onto a nail gun and is shot repeatedly in the head. Though questioned by the police after Erin's death, both Wendy and Kevin are let go. Assuming that whoever was next must be dead, they decide to ensure their own safety. While leaving the police station, Wendy is stalked by a grief-stricken Ian.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to refloat her, Captain Pearce ordered Gothenburg to be {{lightened}} forward. Water casks used as ballast and passengers were positioned aft in an endeavour to refloat her as the tide rose, but without success. Finally, a fatal {{attempt was made to}} refloat her, by reversing the engine hard. The vessel came half off the reef, but holed herself badly and then slewed broadside to the waves, in a much worse position. However, with the tide rising and some cargo now being dumped overboard, all aboard still expected Gothenburg to float free. With strong winds changing direction and seas increasing, the boiler fires were extinguished by water rising through the damaged stern. Around midnight, the chief engineer came on deck to report that the engine room was flooded <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was of no further use. With heavy seas now rushing down hatchways and into the cabins, Gothenburg was doomed and Captain Pearce was forced to admit that the situation had become desperate.|$|E
5|$|New to the Forza {{series is}} a feature known as Autovista. It is {{designed}} to allow players to walk around and explore inside cars. This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads, engine components, and interior details. The player can point at certain features, such as headlights, wheels <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> for further information about them via audio recording. It can be controlled via Kinect or a game controller. Only 24 cars in the game support the Autovista feature, as it is primarily for sports cars, classic cars, and dream cars. The graphics used to create these cars are formed using image-based lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections, and would better immerse {{the car in the}} environment both when racing on a track or in the garage or Top Gear studio when viewing a car.|$|E
5000|$|The main deck, {{sometimes}} called the freight or weather deck, carried <b>the</b> boiler, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> for <b>the</b> vessel, as well as crew quarters, <b>the</b> kitchen, <b>and</b> space for freight.|$|R
