40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technical approach for fusing information from diverse sources. Fusion requires appropriate weighting of information {{based on the}} quality of the source of the information. A credibility model characterizes the quality of information based on the source and the circumstances under which the information is collected. In many cases credibility is uncertain, so inference is necessary. Explicit probabilistic credibility models provide a computational model of the quality of the information that allows use of prior information, evidence when available, and opportunities for learning from data. This paper provides an overview of the challenges, describes the <b>advanced</b> probabilistic <b>reasoning</b> <b>tools</b> used to implement credibility models, and provides an example of the use of credibility models in a multi-source fusion process...|$|R
40|$|Medical imaging is a {{powerful}} and increasingly popular tool. This project addresses two major problems: data storage and transmission; and automated diagnosis and classification. We suggest that by addressing the latter issuue using <b>advanced</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>tools</b> and clinical models (necessary {{in even the most}} deceptively obvious modailities), medical images (and subregions within them) can be categorised according to medical standards. Past experience has suggested that simple techniques fail to provide accurate results; and that to cope with the wide diversity of image information within any one medical modaility and subdomain (e. g. leg radiograophs) an adaptable system that combines evidence from multiple sources is required. The outcome from using such a system will provide a means for indexing large numbers of images. Furthermore, we suggest that the clinical classification of an image is of importance in categorisng image sub-regions and so providing a means by which differential information retaining compression techniques can be used, alleviating many problesm related to dtaa storage and image transmission. These problems need to be addressed as we move towards a technology dependent medical domain using Picture Archiving and Communication systems and Telereadiology techniques for diagnosis, conference and teaching purposes. Background Medical imaging is {{a powerful}} and useful tool of use to radiologists and consultants, allowing them to improve and facilitate their diagnoses.

40|$|New {{trends in}} Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) {{highlight}} {{the need for}} decoupling the automation aspect from the knowledge management side of KBE. In this direction, some authors argue that KBE is capable of effectively capturing, retaining and reusing engineering knowledge. However, there are some limitations associated with some aspects of KBE that present a barrier to deliver the knowledge sourcing process requested by the industry. To overcome some of these limitations this research proposes a new methodology for efficient knowledge capture and effective management of the complete knowledge life cycle. Current knowledge capture procedures represent {{one of the main}} constraints limiting the wide use of KBE in the industry. This is due to the extraction of knowledge from experts in high cost knowledge capture sessions. To reduce the amount of time required from experts to extract relevant knowledge, this research uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques capable of generating new knowledge from company assets. Moreover the research reported here proposes the integration of AI methods and experts increasing as a result the accuracy of the predictions and the reliability of using <b>advanced</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>tools.</b> The proposed knowledge sourcing framework integrates two features: (i) use of advanced data mining tools and expert knowledge to create new knowledge from raw data, (ii) adoption of a well-established and reliable methodology to systematically capture, transfer and reuse engineering knowledge. The methodology proposed in this research is validated through {{the development and implementation of}} two case studies aiming at the optimisation of wing design concepts. The results obtained in both use cases proved the extended KBE capability for fast and effective knowledge sourcing. This evidence was provided by the experts working in the development of each of the case studies through the implementation of structured quantitative and qualitative analyses...|$|R

40|$|Recently, the {{classical}} backtracking-search satisability algorithm of Davis, Put-nam, Loveland and Logemann (DPLL) has been enhanced in two distinct directions: with more <b>advanced</b> <b>reasoning</b> methods, or with con ict-directed back-jumping (CBJ). Previous methods used one idea or the other, but not both (except that CBJ has been {{combined with the}} unit-clause rule). The diÆculty is that more <b>advanced</b> <b>reasoning</b> derives new clauses, but does not identify which backtrackable assumptions were relevant for the derivation. However CBJ needs this information. The linear-time decision procedure for binary-clause formulas {{is a good example}} of this phenomenon. This paper describes an eÆcient method to integrate several popular reasoning methods with CBJ. It includes binary-clause reasoning, equivalent-literal identi-cation, variable-elimination resolution, and others. The main idea is to exploit the fact that DPLL can be viewed as an algorithm to construct a resolution refutation, rather than as backtracking-search for a model. Con ict sets in CBJ correspond to clauses in the resolution refutation. Incorporating <b>advanced</b> <b>reasoning</b> into this dual view of DPLL shows the way to combine it soundly with CBJ. Experiments show that the search space is reduced, but that memory has to be managed extremely carefully. ...|$|R

It promises long-sought-after benefits such as increased software reuse, reduced development time to market and, hence, reduced software production cost. Despite the huge potential, the lack of reasoning support and development environment of component modeling and verification may hinder its development. Methods and tools that can support component model analysis are highly appreciated by industry. Such a tool support should be fully automated as well as efficient.
