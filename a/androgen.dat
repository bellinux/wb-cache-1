5|$|A {{reversible}} surgical method {{under investigation}} is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) {{which consists of}} injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, into the vas deferens. An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility. Another is an intravas device which involves putting a urethane plug into the vas deferens to block it. A combination of an <b>androgen</b> and a progestin seems promising, as do selective <b>androgen</b> receptor modulators. Ultrasound and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{higher levels of}} <b>androgen</b> exposure, the female hyenas are {{significantly}} more muscular and aggressive than their male counterparts; social-wise, they are of higher rank than the males, being dominant or dominant and alpha, and the females who {{have been exposed to}} higher levels of <b>androgen</b> than average become higher-ranking than their female peers. Subordinate females lick the clitorises of higher-ranked females as a sign of submission and obedience, but females also lick each other's clitorises as a greeting or to strengthen social bonds; in contrast, while all males lick the clitorises of dominant females, the females will not lick the penises of males because males are considered to be of lowest rank.|$|E
5|$|During early {{childhood}} <b>androgen</b> synthesis and secretion remain low, but {{several years before}} puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical <b>androgen</b> production that lead to increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes {{are part of a}} process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.|$|E
25|$|The main {{subset of}} <b>androgens,</b> known as adrenal <b>androgens,</b> is {{composed}} of 19-carbon steroids synthesized in the zona reticularis, the innermost layer of the adrenal cortex. Adrenal <b>androgens</b> function as weak steroids (though some are precursors), and the subset includes dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), androstenedione (A4), and androstenediol (A5).|$|R
25|$|Adrenal <b>androgens</b> are steroids {{produced}} by the zona reticulosa of the adrenal cortex in both sexes. The major adrenal <b>androgens</b> are dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione (which are precursors of testosterone), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate which is present in large amounts in the blood. Adrenal <b>androgens</b> contribute to the androgenic events of early puberty in girls.|$|R
40|$|<b>Androgens</b> have {{important}} physiological effects in women {{while at the}} same time they may be implicated in breast cancer pathologies. However, data on the effects of <b>androgens</b> on mammary epithelial proliferation and/or breast cancer incidence are not in full agreement. We performed a literature review evaluating current clinical, genetic and epidemiological data regarding the role of <b>androgens</b> in mammary growth and neoplasia. Epidemiological studies appear to have significant methodological limitations and thus provide inconclusive results. The study of molecular defects involving androgenic pathways in breast cancer is still in its infancy. Clinical and nonhuman primate studies suggest that <b>androgens</b> inhibit mammary epithelial proliferation and breast growth while conventional estrogen treatment suppresses endogenous <b>androgens.</b> Abundant clinical evidence suggests that <b>androgens</b> normally inhibit mammary epithelial proliferation and breast growth. Suppression of <b>androgens</b> using conventional estrogen treatment may thus enhance estrogenic breast stimulation and possibly breast cancer risk. Addition of testosterone to the usual hormone therapy regimen may diminish the estrogen/progestin increase in breast cancer risk but the impact of this combined use on mammary gland homeostasis still needs evaluation...|$|R
5|$|Sex steroids {{are known}} to affect the rate of sebum secretion; androgens such as {{testosterone}} {{have been shown to}} stimulate secretion, and estrogens have been shown to inhibit secretion. Dihydrotestosterone acts as the primary <b>androgen</b> in the prostate and in hair follicles.|$|E
5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive <b>androgen</b> production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the <b>androgen</b> receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} for erectile dysfunction to exist not {{as a direct result}} of SCI but due to factors such as major depression, diabetes, or drugs such as those taken for spasticity. Finding and treating the root cause may alleviate the problem. For example, men who experience erectile problems as the result of a testosterone deficiency can receive <b>androgen</b> replacement therapy.|$|E
40|$|Maternally derived yolk <b>androgens</b> affect {{many aspects}} of {{phenotypic}} development. To explore this phenomenon I injected clutches of American kestrels (Falco sparverius) with one of three different dosages of testosterone + androstenedione or with vehicle. Morphological measurements taken from nestlings 26 days after hatching showed no significant treatment effect. In 2007, nestlings with more yolk <b>androgens</b> had lower hatching mass and higher hematocrit levels 15 days after hatching than nestlings with less yolk <b>androgens,</b> but the effects disappeared by day 26. In 2008, there were no effects of <b>androgens</b> on mass or hematocrit. Because the results were not consistent between years, and because field year {{had a significant effect}} on many morphological and blood measurements, <b>androgens</b> may be linked to the environmental conditions. Over two field seasons, control clutches and clutches given the largest dosage of <b>androgens</b> had the highest number of nestlings hatch and fledge. The survival rate from a clutch was affected differently depending on the amount of exogenous <b>androgens</b> injected into the eggs. A study by Sockman and Schwabl (2000) supports the anomaly of lowered survival as a function of exogenous <b>androgens,</b> but their nestlings died mostly after hatching and the kestrels in my study died before hatching...|$|R
40|$|In birds, early {{exposure}} to <b>androgens</b> {{has been shown}} to influence offspring growth and begging behaviour, and has been proposed as a mechanism for the development of sexual size dimorphism (SSD). Sex specific effects during development can occur due to sex-specific allocation of maternal <b>androgens,</b> sensitivity to, or synthesis of, <b>androgens.</b> In addition, maternal hormones have been suggested as a mechanism to skew brood sex ratio. This study uses one of the world’s most extreme SSD species, the brown songlark Cinclorhamphus cruralis, to investigate (1) sex-specific differences of <b>androgens</b> in yolk and chick plasma and (2) the relationship between <b>androgens</b> and sex ratio bias. The study reveals no indication of sex-specific maternal allocation, but a modest sex effect during the later stages of incubation when the embryo starts to produce its own <b>androgens.</b> Moreover, there was a strong seasonal sex ratio bias: female-biased early and male-biased later in the season, but yolk testosterone (T) did not show a seasonal trend. Taken together these results suggest that if <b>androgens,</b> from any source, have a significant role in development of SSD in this species it is most likely via sex-specific sensitivity or synthesis rather than differential maternal transfer to the egg. ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>androgens</b> {{function}} as paracrine hormones {{required by the}} Sertoli cells to support sperm production. They are also required for masculinization of the developing male fetus (including penis and scrotum formation). Under the influence of <b>androgens,</b> remnants of the mesonephron, the Wolffian ducts, develop into the epididymis, vas deferens and seminal vesicles. This action of <b>androgens</b> {{is supported by a}} hormone from Sertoli cells, Müllerian inhibitory hormone (MIH), which prevents the embryonic Müllerian ducts from developing into fallopian tubes and other female reproductive tract tissues in male embryos. MIH and <b>androgens</b> cooperate to allow for movement of testes into the scrotum.|$|R
5|$|The {{length of}} the {{gestation}} period tends to vary greatly, though 110 days is {{the average length of}} time. In the final stages of pregnancy, dominant females provide their developing offspring with higher <b>androgen</b> levels than lower-ranking mothers do. The higher <b>androgen</b> levels the result of high concentrations of ovarian androstenedione are thought to be responsible for the extreme masculinization of female behavior and morphology. This has the effect of rendering the cubs of dominant females more aggressive and sexually active than those of lower ranking hyenas; high ranking male cubs will attempt to mount females earlier than lower ranking males. The average litter consists of two cubs, with three occasionally being reported. Males take no part in the raising of young. Giving birth is difficult for female hyenas, as the females give birth through their narrow clitoris, and spotted hyena cubs are the largest carnivoran young relative to their mothers' weight. During parturition, the clitoris ruptures in order to facilitate the passage of the young, and may take weeks to heal.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal activity, such as {{occurs during}} menstrual cycles and puberty, may {{contribute}} to the formation of acne. During puberty, an increase in sex hormones called androgens causes the skin follicle glands to grow larger and make more oily sebum. Several hormones have been linked to acne, including the androgens testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA); high levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have also been associated with worsened acne. Both androgens and IGF-1 seem to be essential for acne to occur, as acne does not develop in individuals with complete <b>androgen</b> insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) or Laron syndrome (insensitivity to GH, resulting in very low IGF-1 levels).|$|E
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that commonly cause a high-androgen state, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting tumors, can cause acne in affected individuals. Conversely, people who lack androgenic hormones or are {{insensitive to the}} effects of androgens rarely have acne. An increase in <b>androgen</b> and oily sebum synthesis can be seen during pregnancy. Acne can be a side effect of testosterone replacement therapy or of anabolic steroid use. Over-the-counter bodybuilding and dietary supplements are commonly found to contain illegally added anabolic steroids.|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} demonstrated that physiological levels of <b>androgens</b> exert direct and potent inhibitory {{effects on the}} growth of human breast cancer ZR- 75 - 1 cells in vivo in nude mice {{as well as in}} vitro under both basal and estrogen-stimulated conditions. The inhibitory effect of <b>androgens</b> has also been confirmed on the growth of dimethylbenz(a) anthracene (DMBA) -induced mammary carcinoma in the rat. Such observations are in close agreement with the clinical data showing that <b>androgens</b> and the androgenic compound medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) have beneficial effects in breast cancer in women comparable to other endocrine therapies, including tamoxifen. Although the inhibitory action of <b>androgens</b> on cell proliferation in estrogen-induced ZR- 75 - 1 cells results, in part, from their suppressive effect on expression of the estrogen receptor, the <b>androgens</b> also exert a direct inhibitory effect independent of estrogens. <b>Androgens</b> cause a global slowing effect on the duration of the cell cycle. These observations support clinical data showing that androgenic compounds induce an objective remission after failure of antiestrogen therapy as well as those indicating that the antiproliferative action of <b>androgens</b> is additive to that of antiestrogens. We have also recently demonstrated in ZR- 75 - 1 human breast cancer cells the antagonism between <b>androgens</b> and estrogens on the expression of GCDFP- 15 and GCDFP- 24 which are two major proteins secreted in human gross cystic disease fluid. The effects of <b>androgens</b> and estrogens {{as well as those of}} progestins and glucocorticoids on GCDFP- 15 and GCDFP- 24 mRNA levels and secretion are opposite to those induced by the same steroids on cell growth in ZR- 75 - 1 cells. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
25|$|Numerous {{reports have}} shown <b>androgens</b> alone {{are capable of}} {{altering}} {{the structure of the}} brain, but identification of which alterations in neuroanatomy stem from <b>androgens</b> or estrogens is difficult, because of their potential for conversion.|$|R
30|$|Felemban et al. [10] {{reported}} that LOD reduced both blood LH and <b>androgens,</b> and that, among <b>androgens,</b> dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) {{derived from the}} adrenal gland was significantly reduced. In this passed study, testosterone and androstenedione, probably derived from the ovary, were significantly reduced, but DHEA-S was not. Considering the fact that either OMLOD or LOD is a local procedure targeting the ovary, LOD or OMLOD is unlikely to reduce DHEA-S derived from the adrenal gland. LOD may exert their effect through a reduction of ovary-derived <b>androgens.</b> Amar et al. and Rossmanith et al. Also reported similar results, regarding the post drilling effects on serum <b>androgens</b> [24, 25].|$|R
5|$|If {{exposed to}} testosterone, the genital {{tubercle}} elongates {{to form the}} penis. By fusion of the urogenital folds– elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to the}} formation of the urethral groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle– the urogenital sinus closes completely and forms the spongy urethra, and the labioscrotal swellings unite to form the scrotum. In the absence of testosterone, the genital tubercle allows for formation of the clitoris; the initially rapid growth of the phallus gradually slows and the clitoris is formed. The urogenital sinus persists as the vestibule of the vagina, the two urogenital folds form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora, completing the female genitalia. A rare condition that can develop from higher than average <b>androgen</b> exposure is clitoromegaly.|$|E
5|$|In women, acne can be {{improved}} {{with the use of}} any combined birth control pill. These decrease the production of <b>androgen</b> hormones by the ovaries, resulting in lower skin production of sebum, and consequently reduce acne severity. Combinations containing third- or fourth-generation progestins such as desogestrel, drospirenone, or norgestimate are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects. A 2014 review found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months. However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions. The authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|Special {{behavioral}} {{features of}} the dromedary include snapping at others without biting them and showing displeasure by stamping their feet.

A 1980 study showed <b>androgen</b> levels in males influences their behaviour. Between January and April when these levels are high during the rut, they become difficult to manage, blow out the palate from the mouth, vocalise and throw urine over their backs. Camels scratch parts of their bodies with their legs or with their lower incisors. They may also rub against tree bark and roll in sand.|$|E

5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the female}} closely resembles that of the male; the clitoris is shaped and positioned like a penis, and is capable of erection. The female also possesses no external vagina (vaginal opening), as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. The pseudo-penis is traversed to its tip by a central urogenital canal, through which the female urinates, copulates and gives birth. The pseudo-penis can be distinguished from the males' genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded glans. In both males and females, {{the base of the}} glans is covered with penile spines. The formation of the pseudo-penis appears largely <b>androgen</b> independent, as the pseudo-penis appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and adrenal gland. After parturition, the pseudo-penis is stretched, and loses many of its original aspects; it becomes a slack-walled and reduced prepuce with an enlarged orifice with split lips.|$|E
25|$|While in {{the fetal}} stages, {{hormonal}} influences of <b>androgen,</b> specifically testosterone, cause feminine qualities {{in regard to}} sexual development in females and masculine qualities in males.

Moreover, they predominantly protect XY fetuses from <b>androgen</b> underexposure while protecting XX fetuses from <b>androgen</b> overexposure. However, when <b>androgen</b> overexposure happens in XX fetuses, research suggests they can show masculinized behavior in comparison to females who undergo normal levels of <b>androgen</b> exposure.

40|$|Macrophage Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) play an {{important}} role in the host defense against infection and in the pathophysiology of immune cytopenias. Modulation of macrophage FcγR expression is a potential therapeutic approach to immune disorders. Glucocorticoids and progesterones decrease macrophage FcγR expression. We assessed the effect of treatment with <b>androgens</b> and antiandrogens on the expression of macrophage FcγRs using an experimental guinea pig model. Four <b>androgens</b> (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, mesterolone, and danazol) and five antiandrogens (flutamide, nilutamide, cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and finasteride) were studied. Following in vivo treatment of guinea pigs, we determined the clearance of immunoglobulin G (IgG) -sensitized erythrocytes in vivo, the binding of IgG-sensitized erythrocytes by isolated splenic macrophages, and splenic macrophage FcγR cell surface expression. All of the <b>androgens</b> impaired the clearance of IgG-sensitized erythrocytes by decreasing splenic macrophage FcγR expression. Dihydrotestosterone and mesterolone were more effective than testosterone or dihydrotestosterone. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy with monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that the <b>androgens</b> decreased the cell surface expression of FcγR 1, 2 more than that of FcγR 2. Antiandrogens did not significantly alter macrophage FcγR expression. Nevertheless, antiandrogens counteracted the effects of <b>androgens</b> on macrophage FcγR expression. These data indicate that <b>androgens</b> impair the clearance of IgG-coated cells by decreasing splenic macrophage FcγR expression. Thus, <b>androgens</b> other than danazol are candidate drugs for the treatment of immune disorders...|$|R

The view of <b>androgens</b> as a chiefly male- associated hormone is long outdated, and there is an increasing wealth of evidence for the role of <b>androgens</b> in women. <b>Androgens,</b> in addition to estrogen and other hormones, play several various and critical roles in females, particularly in the development and function of the female genital tract. Countless, targeted studies have been conducted in efforts to elucidate how <b>androgens</b> affect the development and function of the female genitalia, most notably in regards to the vagina, uterus, and ovaries. However, though the significance of female <b>androgens</b> is relatively well established, knowledge on this subject is still developing and somewhat fragmented. The objective of this review is to present a comprehensive view of the role of <b>androgens</b> in the development and function of the female genital tract, summarize new studies, and integrate the most current information in order to gain a broadened and enhanced understanding of the importance and implications of <b>androgens</b> in females. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|R

25|$|Cyproterone acetate is a {{powerful}} antiandrogen and progestin that suppresses gonadotropin levels (which in turn reduces <b>androgen</b> levels), blocks androgens from binding to and activating the <b>androgen</b> receptor, and inhibits enzymes in the <b>androgen</b> biosynthesis pathway.

25|$|During puberty, <b>androgen,</b> LH and {{follicle}} stimulating hormone (FSH) production {{increase and}} the sex cords hollow out, forming the seminiferous tubules, and the germ cells start to differentiate into sperm. Throughout adulthood, androgens and FSH cooperatively act on Sertoli cells in the testes to support sperm production. Exogenous <b>androgen</b> supplements {{can be used as}} a male contraceptive. Elevated <b>androgen</b> levels caused by use of <b>androgen</b> supplements can inhibit production of LH and block production of endogenous androgens by Leydig cells. Without the locally high levels of androgens in testes due to <b>androgen</b> production by Leydig cells, the seminiferous tubules can degenerate, resulting in infertility.
