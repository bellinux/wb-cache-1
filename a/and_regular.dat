Four are formed from infinite strips of squares or equilateral triangles, and three are formed from equilateral triangles <b>and</b> <b>regular</b> hexagons.

There have been preliminary indications that the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers may be protective. A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term <b>and</b> <b>regular</b> users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.|$|E

5|$|Kepler {{began by}} {{exploring}} regular polygons <b>and</b> <b>regular</b> solids, including the figures {{that would come}} to be known as Kepler's solids. From there, he extended his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies—and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between orbital velocity and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler—with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories—treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them.|$|E
