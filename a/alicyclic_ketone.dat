40|$|The {{synthesis}} of isomeric benzothienopyran- 4 -ones has been investigated. 2 -Methoxybenzo[bthiophene {{has been used}} to prepare 2, 2 -dimethyl- 2, 3 -dihydrobenzothieno[2, 3 -b] pyran- 4 -one via acylation with 3, 3 -dimethylacryloyl chloride. 2 -Acetyl- 3 -hydroxybenzo[bjthiophene, readily available in a single step from thiosalicylic acid, {{has been used to}} obtain a range of 2, 2 -disubstituted 2, 3 -dihydrobenzothieno[3, 2 -bjpyran- 4 -ones by direct condensation with an aliphatic or <b>alicyclic</b> <b>ketone</b> under pyrrolidine catalysis. A greatly improved route was developed which relied upon formation of the dianion of 2 -acetyl- 3 -hydroxybenzo[b]thiophene. The dianion was intercepted {{with a wide range of}} ketones to give the corresponding / 3 -hydroxy ketones. Cyclisation to the benzothieno[3, 2 -b]pyranones results on treatment with acid. Reaction of the dianion with tetraphenylcyclopentadienone gave a fulvene derivative that was resistant to cyclisation. With 2, 5 -diethyl- 3, 4 -diphenylcyclopentadienone, stereospecific 1, 6 -addition occurred. The structure of the product was elucidated using X-ray crystallography. Reduction of the benzothienopyranones follows the expected course, as does their reaction with Grignard reagents. However, with PhMgBr, 2, 2 -diphenyl- 3 -methyl- 2, 3 -dihydrobenzothieno[3, 2 -b]pyran- 4 -one underwent a novel reaction sequence to give a 3 -phenylbenzo[b]thiophene derivative, the structure of which was established by X-ray crystallography. The benzothienopyranones are readily cleaved by alkoxide under mild conditions. Reactions of the resulting 2 -alkenoyl- 3 - hydroxybenzo[b] thiophenes with hydrazine derivatives afford novel pyrazolidines. The preparation of 2, 2 -disubstituted benzothieno[2, 3 -b]- and [3, 2 -b]- pyrans has been investigated. The [2, 3 -b] isomers exist preferentially as their dienone valence tautomers. In the latter series, the pyran form predominates and the compounds exhibit photochromism providing that an aryl substituent is present at C- 4. Attempts to effect acid catalysed dehydration of the benzothieno[3, 2 -b]pyran- 4 -ols failed. However, treatment with N,N-dimethylcarbamyl chloride effects a novel acylative ring cleavage to give 2 -(alka- 1, 3 -dien- I -yl) - 3 (dimethylaminocarbamyloxy) benzo[b]thiophenes. Electrocyclisation of these carbamates has been accomplished and developed as a new approach to dibenzothiophenes and fused-ring derivatives. The {{synthesis of}} chroman- 4 -ones possessing C- 2 spiro-annulated 9 -(9 Hfluorene), 1 '-indane, 3 '-(2, 3 -dihydrobenzofuran), and 3 '-(2, 3 -dihydrobenzo-[b]thiophene) units has been accomplished and their oxidative ring expansion by organoiodine(Ill) reagents e. g. PhI(OH) OTs has been investigated. The indane derivative afforded 1 2 H-benzo[a]xanthen- 12 -one and its 5, 6 -dihydro derivative together with 5, 6 -dihydro- 7 H-benzo[c]xanthen- 7 -one, whilst the benzofuran affords a ring cleaved product together with the tetracyclic rotenoid core, rotoxen- 12 (611) -one. Conjugate reduction of these systems provided both the cis and trans tetrahydrobenzoxanthones, and the trans-B/C fused rotenoid, respectively. Treatment of the spiro benzo[b]thiophene derivative with PhI(OH) OTs in methanol initiated a novel Pummerer-type reaction and rearrangement products were not observed...|$|E

From Prelog's researches into the stereospecificity of microbiological reductions of <b>alicyclic</b> <b>ketones</b> and the enzymic oxidation of alcohols, he contributed not only to the knowledge of the mechanism of stereospecificity of enzymic reactions in general but also to the structure of the active site of the enzyme.|$|R

It {{is used as a}} reagent for the introduction of amine groups ( [...] - NH2), for the conversion of aldehydes into nitriles and <b>alicyclic</b> <b>ketones</b> into lactams (cyclic amides), and for the synthesis of variety of nitrogen-containing heterocycles.|$|R
40|$|The {{saturated}} ring hydrocarbons {{are generally}} believed {{to behave as}} aliphatic compounds, for which reason they are frequently referred to as alicyclic. Just as in an homologous series of aliphatic chain compounds {{there is not a}} steady gradation in behaviour (e. g. the extreme lack of reactivity of neopentyl derivatives in negative ion-replacement reactions as compared with the corresponding propyl and isobutyl derivatives (1)), so in the alicyclic series, striking differences have been observed in the chemical behaviour of cyclohexyl derivatives as compared with derivatives of smaller and larger saturated rings. For example, although the rates of esterification of cyclopentanol, cyclohexanol and cycloheptanol decrease steadily with {{increase in the number of}} carbon atoms in the ring (2), the rate of decomposition of sodium bisulphite derivatives of <b>alicyclic</b> <b>ketones</b> shows a minimum with the six membered ring (3).

40|$|Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase-catalysed {{reactions}} are attractive for industrial processes. Here {{we report on}} expanding the substrate scope of phenylacetone monooxygenase (PAMO). In order to introduce activity on <b>alicyclic</b> <b>ketones</b> in PAMO, we generated and screened a library of 1, 500 mutants. Based on recently published structures of PAMO and its mutants, we selected previously uncharacterised positions as well as known hot-spots to be targeted by focused mutagenesis. We were able to mutate 11 positions in a single step by using the OmniChange method for the mutant library generation. Screening of the library using a phosphate-based activity detection method allowed identification of a quadruple mutant (P 253 F/G 254 A/R 258 M/L 443 F) active on cyclopentanone. The substrate scope of this mutant is extended to several aliphatic ketones while activity on aromatic compounds typical for PAMO was preserved. Moreover, the mutant is as thermostable as PAMO. Our results demonstrate the power of screening structure-inspired, focused mutant libraries for creating Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases with new specificities...|$|R
50|$|Ziegler’s {{work with}} many-membered ring {{compounds}} also utilized the reactive nature of alkali metal compounds. He used strong bases {{such as the}} lithium and sodium salts of amines, to accomplish the cyclization of long-chain hydrocarbons possessing terminal cyano groups. The initially formed ring compound was then converted to the desired macrocyclic ketone product. Ziegler’s synthetic method, which included running reactions at high dilution to favor the intramolecular cyclization over competing intermolecular reactions, resulted in yields superior to those of existing procedures (Laylin): {{he was able to}} prepare large-ringed <b>alicyclic</b> <b>ketones,</b> C14 to C33, in yields of 60-80%. An outstanding instance of this synthesis was the preparation of muscone, the odiferous principle of animal musk by Leopold Ružička. Ziegler and co-workers published the first of their series of papers on the preparation of large ring systems in 1933. For his work in this area and in free-radical chemistry he was awarded the Liebig Memorial Medal in 1935.|$|R
30|$|BVMO 4 {{has a wide}} {{substrate}} scope and oxidizes substrates with aromatic moiety, substituted cyclic ketones and ketones in multi-ring compounds. In addition, the enzyme oxidized alicyclic and linear aliphatic ketones, thiols and bulky substrates, such as steroids, although at a lower rate. Despite the primary sequence of the enzyme is close to BVMOs belonging to CPDMO group, it poorly oxidizes medium-sized ketones and did not show activity on cyclopentadecanone. Some discrepancies in the enzyme sequence can be the cause for the different affinity for bulky <b>alicyclic</b> <b>ketones.</b> Thus, it can be speculated that BVMO 4 is a novel enzyme. In fact, {{when compared to other}} BVMOs in the CPDMO group, this enzyme branches out early in the phylogenetic tree (Figure  1). When the kinetic parameters were measured with phenylacetone and 2 -methylcyclohexanone as substrates, the Km values were in the order of hundreds of μM (Table  3). The Km of cyclohexanone for CHMO (Trudgill [1990]) is two orders of magnitude lower than the ones measured for BVMO 4, indicating that although phenylacetone and 2 -methylcyclohexanone are readily oxidized, BVMO 4 has relatively low affinity for the substrates.|$|R

40|$|Chemical Equation Presented) The keto-enol {{tautomerism}} of 2 -nitrocyclohexanone (2 -NCH) was {{studied in}} aqueous solution under different experimental conditions. Ketonization rate constants were measured spectrophotometrically at 25 °C at an ionic strength of 0. 4 mol dm - 3 (NaCl) in diluted hydrochloric acid, in diluted sodium hydroxide, and in several buffers by using NaHSO 3 as the scavenger of the keto form. A value of pKaEH = 4. 78 for the enol form {{was obtained from the}} rate-pH profile of the reaction. A value of pK aKH = 5. 97 for the keto form was directly obtained from the UV-vis spectra of 2 -NCH recorded at different pHs. The equilibrium constant for the keto-enol tautomerism, pKT = -log([enol]/[ketone]) = 1. 19, was obtained by combining the two pKa values (pKT = pKaKH - pKaEH). A comparison of these results with the corresponding values (Keefe, J. R.; Kresge, A. J. In The Chemistry of Enols; Rappoport, Z., Ed.; Wiley & Sons: New York, 1990; pp 399 - 480) for cyclohexanone shows the dramatic effects of an α-nitro substituent on the keto-enol acidities and the tautomerization constant of <b>alicyclic</b> <b>ketones.</b> Rates and equilibria were discussed {{in the light of the}} Brønsted equation, the principle of nonperfect synchronization, and the Marcus theory. It turns out that, on passing from nitroalkanes to nitroketones, the resonance contribution to pKa and deprotonation rate decreases, being overwhelmed by steric and inductive effects. © 2007 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|A {{strain of}} Arthrobacter was {{isolated}} by enrichment culture with cyclohexaneacetate {{as the sole}} source of carbon and grew with a doubling time of 4. 2 h. In addition to growing with cyclohexaneacetate, the organism also grew with cyclohexanebutyrate at concentrations not above 0. 05 %, and {{with a variety of}} <b>alicyclic</b> <b>ketones</b> and alcohols. Oxidation of cyclohexaneacetate proceeded through formation of the coenzyme A (CoA) ester followed by initiation of a beta-oxidation cycle. beta-Oxidation was blocked before the second dehydrogenation step due to the formation of a tertiary alcohol, and the side chain was eliminated as acetyl-CoA by the action of (1 -hydroxycyclohexan- 1 -yl) acetyl-CoA lyase. The cyclohexanone thus formed was degraded by a well-described route that involves ring-oxygen insertion by a biological Baeyer-Villiger oxygenase. All enzymes of the proposed metabolic sequence were demonstrated in cell-free extracts. Arthrobacter sp. strain CA 1 synthesized constitutive beta-oxidative enzymes, but further induction of enzymes active toward cyclohexaneacetate and its metabolites could occur during growth with the alicyclic acid. Other enzymes of the sequence, (1 -hydroxycyclohexan- 1 -yl) acetyl-CoA lyase and enzymes of cyclohexanone oxidation, were present at negligible levels in succinate-grown cells but induced by growth with cyclohexaneacetate. The oxidation of cyclohexanebutyrate was integrated into the pathway for cyclohexaneacetate oxidation by a single beta-oxidation cycle. Oxidation of the compound could be divided into two phases. Initial oxidation to (1 -hydroxycyclohexan- 1 -yl) acetate could be catalyzed by constitutive enzymes, whereas the further degradation of (1 -hydroxycyclohexan- 1 -yl) acetate was dependent on induced enzyme synthesis which could be inhibited by chloramphenicol with the consequent accumulation of cyclohexaneacetate and (1 -hydroxycyclohexan- 1 -yl) acetate...|$|R
