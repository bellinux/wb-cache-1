25|$|During {{the first}} years of Prohibition, the new law was {{enforced}} in regions such as the rural South and western states, where it had popular support; however, in large urban cities and small industrial or mining towns, residents defied or ignored the law. The Ku Klux Klan was a major supporter of Prohibition; once it was passed they helped with its enforcement. For example, in 1923, Klansmen traded pistol shots with bootleggers, burned down roadhouses, and whipped liquor sellers, and <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>who</b> broke the moral code. The Prohibition was effective in reducing per-capita consumption, and consumption remained lower for a quarter-century after Prohibition had been repealed. Sale of alcoholic beverages remained illegal during Prohibition, but alcoholic drinks were still available. Large quantities of alcohol were smuggled into the United States from Canada, over land, by sea routes along both ocean coasts, and through the Great Lakes, and alcohol was diverted from the limited exceptions to the Volsted Act: medicinal and religious. While the federal government cracked down on alcohol consumption on land within the United States, it was a different story along the U.S. coastlines, where vessels outside the 3-mile limit were exempt. In addition, home brewing was popular during Prohibition. Malt and hops stores popped up across the country and some former breweries turned to selling malt extract syrup, ostensibly for baking and beverage purposes.|$|E
500|$|On release, Chris Welch of Melody Maker declared: [...] "Instant hit! John Lennon {{is singing}} better than ever. With a {{beautiful}} rock 'n' roll echo chamber on his mean but meaningful vocals and some superb drumming, it {{makes up the}} Plastics' best piece of boogie yet." [...] Writing in the NME in 1975, Charles Shaar Murray wrote of the song's [...] "volcanically desperate optimism" [...] and rated it [...] "a classic". Shaar Murray added, with reference to [...] "Cold Turkey" [...] also: [...] "I can't remember <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>who</b> put out two such utter killers in a row {{over the same period}} of time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fanny was {{the first}} all-female rock band to release an album with a major label, and they {{eventually}} released five albums and achieved two top-40 singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The band has long been considered pioneers and are highly respected by later all-women rock groups like The Go-Go's and The Runaways. In 1999 Fanny fan David Bowie said that Fanny was [...] "extraordinary... they're as important as <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>who's</b> ever been, ever; it just wasn't their time." ...|$|R

They were extraordinary... they're as important as <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>who's</b> ever been, ever; it just wasn't their time. Revivify Fanny. And I will feel that my work is done.

60|$|A negro boy {{who went}} {{by the name of}} Wash--evidently short for Washington--gave them more {{information}} than <b>anybody</b> <b>else.</b> This boy, <b>who</b> had been fishing near the woods below Shapette, stated that he had seen the two men go aboard the houseboat early in the morning, accompanied by a young man who was a stranger. The three had cast off the ropes, poled the houseboat far out into the stream, and then drifted out of sight down the mighty Mississippi.|$|R

His first {{long-range}} kill shot was taken during the initial invasion when he shot a woman approaching a group of Marines while carrying a hand grenade. CNN reported that the woman was cradling a toddler in her other hand. As ordered, Kyle opened fire, killing the woman before she could attack. He later stated, [...] "the woman was already dead. I was just making sure she didn't take any Marines with her. It was clear {{that not only did}} she want to kill them, but she didn’t care about <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> nearby <b>who</b> would have been blown up by the grenade or killed in the firefight. Children on the street, people in the houses, maybe her child." ...|$|R

5000|$|Through his {{associate}} with the Society of Assassins and the constabulary, Olirzon finds evidence that suggests that Dalla is in fact alive, and hiding out with her Assassin-bodyguard, Dirzed. Vall realizes that it will prove impossible to find Dalla, so he must do something {{to get her to}} contact him. When Vall and the Assassins go to a restaurant, they find themselves sitting next to a table that contains three Statisticalists who are loudly denouncing Dalla’s work and disappearance as a politically inspired hoax. The three men “were of a breed Verkan Vall had learned to recognize on any time-line -- the arrogant, cocksure, ambitious, leftist politician, who knows what is best for everybody better than <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> does, and <b>who</b> is convinced that he is inescapably right and that whoever differs with him is not only an ignoramus but a venal scoundrel as well.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Which is {{a weight}} {{you might as}} well cast off and be done with it," [...] said Mrs. Lecks, her deep-set notions on the rights of {{property}} obliging her to speak; [...] "for if a man hasn't a right to lock up his house when he goes away and leaves it, I don't know what rights anybody has about anything. Me, or Mrs. Aleshine, or <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> here <b>who</b> has a house, might just as well go off travelin' or to town visitin' and leave our front door unlocked and the yard gate swingin' on its hinges, because we was afraid that some tramp or other body with no house or home might come along {{and not be able to}} get in and make himself comfortable. Your business, sir, when you left that house and all your belongin's on that island, was to leave everything tight and safe, and the business of people sailin' in ships was to go on their proper way and not be runnin' into each other. And if these last mentioned didn't see fit to do that and so got into trouble, they should have gone to some island where there were people to attend to 'em, just as the tramps should go to the poor-house. And this is what we would have done--not meanin' the poor-house--if we hadn't been so over long-headed as to get into a leaky boat, which, I wish it understood, is sayin' nothin' against Mr. Craig." ...|$|R
