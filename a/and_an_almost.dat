5|$|The spores {{are roughly}} spherical to ellipsoidal, {{measuring}} 7.9–9.5 by 8.0–8.8µm. They feature surface ornamentations up to 0.8µm high <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> complete reticulum comprising broad, rounded ridges. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are somewhat cylindrical, four-spored, and measure 50–70 by 9–11µm. The cap cuticle is an ixocutis (made of gelatinous hyphae that run {{parallel to the}} cap surface) up to 60µm thick, with hyphae that are 2–6wide that are usually branched and interwoven.|$|E
5|$|Dubstep's early {{roots are}} in the more {{experimental}} releases of UK garage producers, seeking to incorporate elements of drum and bass into the South London-based 2-step garage sound. These experiments often {{ended up on the}} B-side of a white label or commercial garage release. Dubstep is generally instrumental. Similar to a vocal garage hybrid – grime – the genre's feel is commonly dark; tracks frequently use a minor key and can feature dissonant harmonies such as the tritone interval within a riff. Other distinguishing features often found are the use of samples, a propulsive, sparse rhythm, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> omnipresent sub-bass. Some dubstep artists have also incorporated a variety of outside influences, from dub-influenced techno such as Basic Channel to classical music or heavy metal.|$|E

5|$|Romanesque art, {{especially}} metalwork, was at {{its most}} sophisticated in Mosan art, in which distinct artistic personalities including Nicholas of Verdun (d. 1205) become apparent, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> classical style is seen in works such as a font at Liège, contrasting with the writhing animals of the exactly contemporary Gloucester Candlestick. Large illuminated bibles and psalters were the typical forms of luxury manuscripts, and wall-painting flourished in churches, often following a scheme with a Last Judgement on the west wall, a Christ in Majesty at the east end, and narrative biblical scenes down the nave, or in the best surviving example, at Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe, on the barrel-vaulted roof.|$|E
5|$|Before World War II, the {{international}} shipping demand for bulk products was low—about 25million tons for metal ores—and {{most of this}} trade was coastal. However, on the Great Lakes, bulkers hauled vast amounts of ore from the northern mines to the steel mills. In 1929, 73 million tons of iron ore was transported on the Lakes, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> equal amount of coal, limestone, and other products were also moved. Two defining characteristics of bulkers were already emerging: the double bottom, which was adopted in 1890, and the triangular structure of the ballast tanks, which was introduced in 1905. After World War II, an international bulk trade began to develop among industrialized nations, particularly between the European countries, the United States and Japan. Due to the economics of this trade, ocean bulkers became larger and more specialized. In this period, Great Lakes freighters increased in size, to maximize economies of scale, and self-unloaders became more common to cut turnaround time. The thousand-footers of the Great Lakes fleets, built in the 1970s, were among the longest ships afloat and in 1979, a record 214 million ton of bulk cargo were moved on the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{company that}} {{produced}} Another World, Delphine Software, has since gone into administrative receivership and Another World remains their most recognized game. Paul Cuisset's best-selling 1992 game Flashback, also released by Delphine but created without any involvement from Chahi, features similar gameplay and graphics {{and makes a}} few nods to Another World, {{including the use of}} personal force fields in combat, a nearly identical end text in the ending cutscene, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> exact motion recreation of the gun pickup cutscene. A very similar plot premise was used in 1999's Outcast by Infogrames Entertainment, too from France. The game also had a big influence on several other game designers, especially in Japan. Fumito Ueda cited Another World as an inspiration for his creation of Ico. Hideo Kojima, creator of the Metal Gear series, said {{it was one of the}} five games that influenced him the most. Video game designer Goichi Suda called it his favourite game.|$|E

25|$|At 178-180°C, {{the melting}} point of nylon 12 {{is the lowest}} among the {{important}} polyamides. Its mechanical properties, such as hardness, tensile strength, and resistance to abrasion, {{are similar to those}} of nylon 6 and nylon 66. Low water absorption and density, 1.01 g/mL, result from its relatively long hydrocarbon chain length, which also confers it dimensional stability <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> paraffin-like structure. Nylon 12 is also chemical resistant and insensitive to stress cracking.|$|E

Chechen separatist forces recaptured the city in August 1996, ending the war.|$|E

25|$|During {{the next}} two days, on the {{southern}} front, the Nationalists could not make progress along the valley, so had {{no option but to}} advance up the ridge of the Sierra towards Pico Turbina. This peak, at 1,315m, is a formidable obstacle with slopes of 40° <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> moon-like karst terrain. There were no tracks, even for mules, so supplies and ordnance were largely carried by hand. The weather was bad, too, so aircraft could not operate – but the fog also hid the attacking forces.|$|E

Faced with the potential overthrow of the Danish crown, Christian X stood down and dismissed his own government, installing a compromise cabinet until elections could be held later that year.|$|E
25|$|The 1978 South Lebanon {{conflict}} (code-named Operation Litani by Israel) was {{an invasion}} of Lebanon up to the Litani River, {{carried out by the}} Israel Defense Forces in 1978 in response to the Coastal Road massacre. The conflict resulted in the deaths of 1,100–2,000 Lebanese and Palestinians, 20 Israelis, the internal displacement of 100,000 to 250,000 people in Lebanon, and the PLO forces retreating north of the Litani River. It {{led to the creation of}} the UNIFIL peacekeeping force <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> complete Israeli withdrawal.|$|E

25|$|The abelisaurids all possess distinct, vestigial, and {{immobile}} forelimbs, {{with highly}} reduced manual phalanges. Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus {{are closely related}} but distinguish by several skeletal features. Carnotaurus has eleven dorsal vertebrae but Majungasaurus has thirteen. Carnotaurus has short dentary bones <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> vertical ramus, while that of Majungasaurus curved backward and had notable caudal projections. Majungasaurines also have low, wide antorbital fenestrae, a wide triangular plate posterior to the parietal, two holes for a cerebral vein by the sagittal crest, and a wide groove on the occipital condyle. These differences are important because derived abelisaurids are classed as either majungasaurines or carnotaurines based on their synapomorphies.|$|E
25|$|Given the {{dominance}} of England's batting throughout the season and the limited nature of Australia's bowling, both sides were stunned as England stuttered to 3/17 in their first innings, with Merv Hughes finally providing the venom he had been promising. Hughes, still inexperienced at this point, {{was one of the}} players the selectors stuck with despite his poor form. England recovered somewhat through the strokeplay of Gower <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> embarrassing 69 from John Emburey (who kept falling over when playing the sweep shot). But it was debutant Peter Taylor taking 6/78 off 26 overs that ran through the middle order, including the dangerous Ian Botham.|$|E
