40|$|Inheritable {{chromosome}} aberrations (CA) are {{of concern}} because cytogenetic damage may trigger the carcinogenic process. Moreover, stability of radiation-induced CA {{is a prerequisite}} for meaningful biological dosimetry. CA inheritability arguably depends on the aberration structure, with symmetrical exchanges being favoured over asymmetrical rearrangements, but it is also affected by radiation quality. CA induced by low-LET protons and high-LET 12 C ions in G 0 peripheral blood lymphocytes were measured in first-, second- and third-generation by combined FISH/harlequin staining of metaphase as well as prematurely condensed interphase chromosomes 1 and 2. As expected, the frequency of non-transmissible (NT) aberrations declined through replication rounds. A radiation-induced arrest occurred prior to first post-irradiation mitosis that prevalently affected <b>aberrant</b> <b>cells.</b> <b>Aberrant</b> <b>cells</b> incurred cycle delays also at subsequent cycles following proton-irradiation but not 12 C ion-irradiation. As expected, the frequency of reciprocal translocations remained fairly stable while that of dicentrics was halved at each mitotic round. A significant fraction of complex-type exchanges was found in third-generation cells following both irradiations and appeared to be transmitted relatively more efficiently after protons than 12 C ions. A low but stably transmitted frequency of transmissible (T) -type insertions were detected after 12 C ions but not after low LET-irradiation.

40|$|SummaryIn {{multicellular}} organisms, tissue {{integrity and}} organ size are maintained through removal of <b>aberrant</b> or damaged <b>cells</b> and compensatory proliferation. Little is known, however, about this homeostasis system in postmitotic tissues, where tissue-intrinsic genetic programs constrain cell division and new cells no longer arise from stem cells. Here we show that, in postmitotic Drosophila follicular epithelia, <b>aberrant</b> but viable <b>cells</b> are eliminated through cell competition, {{and the resulting}} loss of local tissue volume triggers sporadic cellular hypertrophy to repair the tissue. This “compensatory cellular hypertrophy” is implemented by acceleration of the endocycle, a variant cell cycle composed of DNA synthesis and gap phases without mitosis, dependent on activation of the insulin/IGF-like signaling pathway. These results reveal a remarkable homeostatic mechanism in postmitotic epithelia that ensures not only elimination of <b>aberrant</b> <b>cells</b> through cell competition but also proper organ-size control that involves compensatory cellular hypertrophy induced by physical parameters...|$|R
50|$|Researchers {{suggest that}} {{mesoderm}} invagination provides an anterior-posterior pulling force {{that contributes to}} germ-band extension through passive cell shape changes. Although anterior-posterior patterning mutants fail to fully extend their germ-bands, during the fast phase the elongation length is normal despite defects in polarized cell intercalation. Time-lapse analysis revealed that an increase in cell shape stretching in the anterior-posterior axis was compensating for <b>aberrant</b> <b>cell</b> intercalation, independent of anterior-posterior patterning. Furthermore, during wild type development, {{it has been suggested}} that intercalary cell behavior relaxes the stress imposed on the germ-band, allowing stretched cells to restore to isometric shapes.|$|E
50|$|Lab {{studies have}} also implicated {{potential}} therapeutic targets for future clinical studies. VEGFR-1 and EMT mediators may be ideal targets for preventing cancer development and metastasis. 5-aminosalicylate (ASA) {{has been shown to}} reduce β-catenin and its localization to the nucleus in colon cancer cells isolated from and in patients. As a result, it may be useful as a chemopreventative agent for colorectal cancer. Additionally, acyl hydrazones have been shown to inhibit the Wnt signaling characteristic of many cancers by destabilizing β-catenin, thus disrupting Wnt signaling and preventing the <b>aberrant</b> <b>cell</b> growth associated with cancer. On the other hand, some treatment concepts involve upregulating the E-cadherin/catenin adhesion system to prevent disruptions in adhesions and contact inhibition from promoting cancer metastasis. One possible way to achieve this, which has been successful in mouse models, is to use inhibitors of Ras activation in order to enhance the functionality of these adhesion systems. Other catenin, cadherin or cell cycle regulators may also be useful in treating a variety of cancers.|$|E
50|$|Cell {{division}} in any living organism {{is an integral}} part of life, as worn out cells have to be replaced by newly generated cells.

While surgery and/or chemo- and radiotherapies are various treatment modalities available, still in many cases they don’t offer a permanent cure.

Peripheral blood lymphocytes were irradiated in vitro with (238) Pu α particles with a range of mean doses up to 936 mGy and were cultured for 47 h. The dose responses for total <b>aberrant</b> <b>cells,</b> stable and unstable cells, and cells with one simple chromosome aberration and multiple chromosome aberrations were predominantly linear for doses that resulted in cell nuclei receiving a single α-particle traversal. However, there was a decrease per unit dose in <b>aberrant</b> <b>cells</b> of all types at higher doses because of cells increasingly receiving multiple traversals. The proportion of radiation-induced <b>aberrant</b> <b>cells</b> containing multiple aberrations ranged from 48 to 74 % with little evidence of dose dependency. Ninety-one percent of all cells with multiple aberrations were classified as unstable. Resolving the chromosome rearrangements into simple categories resulted in a linear dose response for dicentrics of 24. 9 ± 3. 3 × 10 (- 2) per Gy. The predominant aberration in stable transmissible cells was a single translocation with a dose response for predominantly single hit cell nuclei of 4. 1 ± 1. 3 × 10 (- 2) per Gy. Thus, translocations are the most likely aberration to be observed in peripheral blood lymphocytes from individuals with incorporated α-emitting radionuclides resulting in long-term chronic exposure...|$|R

Twenty-four workers from petroleum plants in Poland and 35 unexposed controls were examined for cytogenetic effects and ras oncoprotein levels and their relationship to confounding factors (e. g., smoking habit, sex family cancer history, and seasonal influence). Preliminary data of chromosome aberrations (CA) and sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) showed differences among sampling subgroups. In this present study, the levels of ras p 21 proteins were determined and further analyses of CA, SCE, high frequency cells (HFC), and proliferative rate index (PRI) have been undertaken. Results show that the exposed group has statistically significant increases in CA, and percent of <b>aberrant</b> <b>cells.</b> There were no differences between exposed and unexposed groups in SCE, HFC, PRI, or the levels of ras p 21 proteins.

5000|$|The reproductive-cell {{cycle theory}} argues that ageing is {{regulated}} specifically by reproductive hormones that act in an antagonistic pleiotropic manner via cell cycle signalling, promoting {{growth and development}} early in life to achieve reproduction, but becoming dysregulated later in life, driving senescence (dyosis) in a futile attempt to maintain reproductive ability.

Moreover, the hormones that regulate reproduction also regulate cellular metabolism, explaining the increases in fat deposition during pregnancy through to the deposition of centralised adiposity with the dysregulation of the HPG axis following menopause and during andropause (Atwood and Bowen, 2006). This theory, which introduced a new definition of ageing, has facilitated the conceptualisation of why and how ageing occurs at the evolutionary, physiological and molecular levels.|$|E

RASD1 could activate G proteins in a receptor-independent manner and inhibit signal transduction through several different G protein-coupled receptors. [...] Although RASD1 {{is a member of}} the Ras superfamily of small G-proteins, which often promotes cell growth and tumor expansion, it plays an active role in preventing <b>aberrant</b> <b>cell</b> growth.

Based on its inhibitory actions on CREB phosphorylation, increased RASD1 in vasopressin-expressing neurons may be essential in controlling the transcriptional responses to stressors in both the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus via modulation of the cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway. RASD1 is also reported to function with leptin in the activation of TRPC4 transient receptor potential channels and, thus, plays a role in regulating electrical excitability in gastrointestinal myocytes, pancreatic β-cells, and neurons.

40|$|International audienceIn the SOD 1 (G 93 A) mutant rat {{model of}} {{amyotrophic}} lateral sclerosis (ALS), neuronal death and rapid paralysis progression {{are associated with the}} emergence of activated <b>aberrant</b> glial <b>cells</b> that proliferate in the degenerating spinal cord. Whether pharmacological downregulation of such <b>aberrant</b> glial <b>cells</b> will decrease motor neuron death and prolong survival is unknown. We hypothesized that proliferation of <b>aberrant</b> glial <b>cells</b> is dependent on kinase receptor activation, and therefore, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor masitinib (AB 1010) could potentially control neuroinflammation in the rat model of ALS. METHODS:The cellular effects of pharmacological inhibition of tyrosine kinases with masitinib were analyzed in cell cultures of microglia isolated from aged symptomatic SOD 1 (G 93 A) rats. To determine whether masitinib prevented the appearance of <b>aberrant</b> glial <b>cells</b> or modified post-paralysis survival, the drug was orally administered at 30 mg/kg/day starting after paralysis onset. RESULTS:We found that masitinib selectively inhibited the tyrosine kinase receptor colony-stimulating factor 1 R (CSF- 1 R) at nanomolar concentrations. In microglia cultures from symptomatic SOD 1 (G 93 A) spinal cords, masitinib prevented CSF-induced proliferation, cell migration, and the expression of inflammatory mediators. Oral administration of masitinib to SOD 1 (G 93 A) rats starting after paralysis onset decreased the number of <b>aberrant</b> glial <b>cells,</b> microgliosis, and motor neuron pathology in the degenerating spinal cord, relative to vehicle-treated rats. Masitinib treatment initiated 7 days after paralysis onset prolonged post-paralysis survival by 40 %. CONCLUSIONS:These data show that masitinib is capable of controlling microgliosis and the emergence/expansion of <b>aberrant</b> glial <b>cells,</b> thus providing a strong biological rationale for its use to control neuroinflammation in ALS. Remarkably, masitinib significantly prolonged survival when delivered after paralysis onset, an unprecedented effect in preclinical models of ALS, and therefore appears well-suited for treating ALS...|$|R

This treatment resulted in a synergistic inhibition of viable cell number increase, which was based on a novel mechanism: (a) After a transient mitotic arrest, cells proceeded through an <b>aberrant</b> <b>cell</b> cycle resulting in hyperploidy.

Recently, alemtuzumab has been proposed as a promising new approach to treat these patients. Only few single cases have been tested at present; nevertheless, in all the cases a clinical improvement was observed.

The slope of the relation, however, varies according to moisture content so that the proportion of <b>aberrant</b> <b>cells</b> for any given loss of germination increases with decrease in moisture content over the range 13. 0 – 5. 5 per cent. At 3. 3 per cent moisture content, however, the proportion of aberrations was no greater than at 5. 5 per cent moisture content; and at 18. 1 per cent moisture content the proportion was no less than at 13. 0 per cent moisture content. Despite these differences, the increase in chromosomal aberrations per unit time for a given temperature was always less the lower the moisture content. Diplontic selection markedly reduced the frequency of chromosomal aberrations and eliminated the differences in these frequencies between the different storage treatments.
