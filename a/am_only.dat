5|$|Frederick's army became {{bogged down}} in the Reppen Forest. The day was already hot and sultry, and the men were already tired. The trees were thick and the ground was {{unstable}} and oozy in some parts, which made {{the movement of the}} heavy guns difficult. Delay after delay slowed them down. The carriages pulling the biggest guns, traveling with the bulk of the army, were too wide to cross the narrow forest bridges and the columns had to be reshuffled in the woods. The Russians could hear them, but thought they were scouting parties, albeit noisy ones; they calculated Finck's column was the primary force. Between 5:00 am. and 6:00 <b>am.,</b> <b>only</b> Finck's demonstrating corps, to the north by Trettin, were visible to the Russians. Finck's right wing moved out of the hills toward the mill on Hühner Fleiss; more Prussians from Finck's left and center prepared to attack the Walkberge. Finck's artillery awaited Frederick's signal, but the bulk of Frederick's army still crashed about in the woods.|$|E

25|$|Other {{stations}} in the Classic Hits group began as local commercial stations owned by the Government-owned Radio New Zealand, {{at a time when}} the New Zealand Government had a monopoly on the New Zealand radio market. In some regions, the station that would eventually become The Hits, was the only available radio station in that region. By the early 1990s, Radio New Zealand had switched most of their stations to FM but retained the stations original AM frequency for coverage in areas where the FM frequency could not be reached or for listeners with an <b>AM</b> <b>only</b> radio. The AM frequency was utilized for talkback and specialist shows in addition to the regular programming on the FM frequency. To cut costs and prepare the stations for commercial sale, Radio New Zealand began rebranding AM stations to Newstalk ZB and rebranding the FM stations as Classic Hits. The Classic Hits stations originally retained their heritage identity until 2009, and used a uniform green diamond logo until June 2011.|$|E

500|$|The {{position}} in which the prince was placed by his marriage, while one of distinction, also offered considerable difficulties; in Albert's own words, [...] "I am very happy and contented; but the difficulty in filling my place with the proper dignity is that I <b>am</b> <b>only</b> the husband, not the master in the house."

He was staying there for a few days while he waited for a berth to become available on a ship to America, as all the transatlantic vessels were fully booked with returnees. He said that he wanted to cycle to places around Edinburgh such as Rosyth and Queensferry and arranged to hire a bicycle. The owner's daughter warned him that some roads were now guarded and he should stop immediately if challenged by a sentry, to which he replied, [...] "Oh, I <b>am</b> <b>only</b> going to be cycling about for pleasure!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a {{contract}} or covenant with God is fundamental to the Jewish religion. [...] The idea that God must uphold {{his end of the}} first commandment has been a subject of works such as Elie Wiesel's play The Trial of God (1979), made in response to the atrocities Wiesel witnessed at Auschwitz. [...] To art historian Matthew Baigell, Hershe's angst regarding his relationship with God is a modern response to the questions of Hillel the Elder's quoted in the Pirkei Avot: [...] "If I am not for myself, who will be for me? [...] But if I <b>am</b> <b>only</b> for myself, what am I? [...] And if not now, when?" [...] Literary scholar Susanne Klingenstein found Hersh's character unrealistic from the view of Jewish scholarship. [...] She wrote that [...] "the suffering of the righteous" [...] is [...] "one of the greatest problems in Jewish thought", and that a character as devoutly religious as Hersh would not have struggled with what she saw as elementary Jewish teaching.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 1956, Wolters feared {{the effect that}} {{disclosure}} of the GBI's eviction of Jewish tenants might have on Speer. [...] Wolters wrote to Kempf concerning the denazification proceedings, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>only</b> anxious about {{the matter of the}} clearance of Jew-flats in Berlin. [...] That could be a bullseye. [...] And this is the point to which the defense should direct itself..." [...] In 1964, Speer mentioned to Wolters in a letter that he would need the Chronik as a reference in revising his memoirs upon his release. [...] Wolter's response was to have Riesser retype the entire Chronik, leaving out any mention of the GBI's involvement in the persecution of the Jews, without telling Speer what he was doing. [...] Wolters later wrote that he did this to correct mistakes, to leave out extraneous matters, and [...] "above all to delete certain parts on the basis of which Speer and one or another of his colleagues could still have been prosecuted. [...] The Ludwigsburg Central office for 'war crimes' was still at work and an end of the persecution of National Socialists was not in sight." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of 11 April, Lennon, Harrison and Mardas sat up late {{discussing}} their views of the Maharishi and {{decided to leave the}} next morning. They packed hurriedly, while Mardas went to Dehradun to find taxis. Lennon was chosen to speak to the Maharishi. When asked why they were leaving, Lennon replied [...] "If you're so cosmic, you'll know why". Paul Mason, a biographer of the Maharishi, later interpreted Lennon's statement as a challenge to the Maharishi's claim of cosmic consciousness. Lennon said that his mind was made up when the Maharishi gave him a murderous look in response. According to Mardas: [...] "John Lennon and I went to the Maharishi about what had happened... he asked the Maharishi to explain himself"; and the Maharishi answered Lennon's accusation by saying, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>only</b> human". But Lennon said he was [...] "a bit rough to him" [...] and the Maharishi responded by saying [...] "I don't know why, you must tell me." [...] While waiting for Mardas to return, Lennon wrote the song [...] "Maharishi", which was later renamed [...] "Sexy Sadie" [...] because Harrison advised Lennon that was potentially libellous. According to Harrison, Lennon [...] "had wanted to leave anyway" [...] and this gave him a [...] "good reason to get out." ...|$|E
500|$|Some vocal {{supporters}} of the defendants spoke out in their defense. A New York resident wrote: [...] "I am not afraid of communism...

Does not the Soviet Union inspire fear {{in the world at}} large precisely because masses of human beings have no confidence in the justice of its criminal procedures against dissidents?... I trust that the Supreme Court will be able to correct a grave error in the operation of our political machinery by finding the... Smith bill unconstitutional." [...] William Z. Foster wrote: [...] "every democratic movement in the United States is menaced by this reactionary verdict... The Communist Party will not be dismayed by this scandalous verdict, which belies our whole national democratic traditions. It will carry the fight to the higher courts, to the broad masses of the people." [...] Vito Marcantonio of the American Labor Party wrote that the verdict was [...] "a sharp and instant challenge to the freedom of every American." [...] The ACLU issued a statement reiterating its opposition to the Smith Act, because it felt the act criminalized political advocacy.|$|E
500|$|Still about [...] {{behind the}} Frenchman, Grahame-White made a {{historic}} decision; {{he would make}} an unprecedented night flight. [...] Guided by the headlamps of his party's cars, he took off at 2:50am. [...] Within minutes of becoming airborne however, he almost crashed; while he was leaning forward to make himself comfortable, his jacket brushed the engine ignition switch and he accidentally turned the engine off, but he quickly corrected his error {{and was able to}} continue. [...] Using the lights of railway stations to guide his course through the pitch black night, within 40minutes he reached Rugby, and at 3:50am he passed Nuneaton. [...] Despite making good progress, Grahame-White was carrying a large load of fuel and oil, and his engine was not powerful enough to raise the aeroplane over the high ground before him. [...] Disappointed, he landed at Polesworth, about [...] from London, and only 10miles behind Paulhan. [...] A few minutes later the Frenchman, unaware of Grahame-White's progress, resumed his journey. [...] He passed Stafford at 4:45am, Crewe at 5:20am, and at 5:32am he landed at Barcicroft Fields near Didsbury, within five miles of the Manchester office of the Daily Mail, thereby winning the contest. [...] His party was taken by train to a civic reception, held by the Lord Mayor of Manchester. [...] Grahame-White was notified of Paulhan's success, and reportedly shouted [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, the £10,000 prize has been won by Louis Paulhan, the finest aviator that the world has ever seen. [...] Compared with him I <b>am</b> <b>only</b> a novice. [...] Three cheers for Paulhan!" [...] He retired to bed, leaving his mechanics to repair his aeroplane, and later sent Paulhan a telegram, congratulating his rival on his achievement. [...] Grahame-White attempted to resume his journey to Manchester, and reached Tamworth, but he later abandoned the flight.|$|E
