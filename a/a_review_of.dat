It has also been suggested that reviews should be conducted of records of great snipe, as older records show a very different temporal occurrence pattern than more recent birds, {{the large numbers of}} gull-billed tern records from the English south coast from the 1960s, and desert wheatears, to establish racial identifications.|$|E

5|$|From time to time, BBRC has re-reviewed {{records that}} it {{previously}} accepted, {{to ensure they}} are acceptable {{in the light of}} improved knowledge of the species in question. These reviews are carried out on a species-by-species basis. Old World warblers have proved particularly in need of re-review. <b>A</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> greenish warbler records was initiated in 1983. The purpose of this review was to establish whether records, particular those in late autumn and winter, of drab grey Phylloscopus warblers, which had previously been accepted as greenish warbler, were in fact this species, or were common chiffchaffs of the Siberian race tristis. 48 records between 1958 and 1970 were examined. Of these, 20 were rejected. <b>A</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> Arctic warbler records was begun in 1991, with the aim of determining whether any greenish warblers had been mistakenly accepted as Arctics.
