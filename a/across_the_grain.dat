25|$|The chief {{difficulty}} {{experienced in}} the drying of timber is the tendency of its outer layers to dry out more rapidly than the interior ones. If these layers are allowed to dry much below the fibre saturation point while the interior is still saturated, stresses (called drying stresses) are set up because the shrinkage of the outer layers is restricted by the wet interior (Keey et al., 2000). Rupture in the wood tissues occurs, and consequently splits and cracks occur if these stresses <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> exceed the strength <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> (fibre to fibre bonding).|$|E

To make the meat more palatable, it was slow-roasted {{to make it more}} tender, then slow-simmered in a spicy broth for flavor. Both the roasting and the broth used Italian-style spices and herbs.

In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of hydrogen environment on fatigue crack growth characteristics of a low carbon steel JIS S 10 C, fatigue crack growth tests were conducted in a low pressure hydrogen gas environment. Fatigue crack growth rate in hygrogen gas is higher than that in nitrogen gas.

25|$|Metals are {{typically}} isotropic, and an ordinary twist drill bit shears {{the edges of}} the hole cleanly. Wood drilled <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> has long strands of wood fiber. These long strands tend {{to pull out of the}} wood hole, rather than being cleanly cut at the hole edge. The lip and spur drill bit has the outside corner of the cutting edges leading, so that it cuts the periphery of the hole before the inner parts of the cutting edges plane off the base of the hole. By cutting the periphery first, the lip maximizes the chance that the fibers can be cut cleanly, rather than having them pull messily out of the timber.|$|E
25|$|As Richard Cromwell {{fell from}} power, he envisaged a step towards a freer {{republic}} or “free commonwealth”, {{writing in the}} hope of this outcome in early 1660. Milton had argued for an awkward position, in the Ready and Easy Way, because he wanted to invoke the Good Old Cause and gain the support of the republicans, but without offering a democratic solution of any kind. His proposal, backed by reference (amongst other reasons) to the oligarchical Dutch and Venetian constitutions, was for a council with perpetual membership. This attitude cut right <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> of popular opinion of the time, which swung decisively behind the restoration of the Stuart monarchy that took place later in the year. Milton, an associate of and advocate on behalf of the regicides, was silenced on political matters as Charles II returned.|$|E
500|$|Built in 3807 or 3806 BC, {{the track}} was a walkway {{consisting}} mainly of planks of oak laid end-to-end, supported by crossed pegs of ash, oak, and lime, {{driven into the}} underlying peat. The planks, which were up to [...] wide, [...] long and less than [...] thick, were cut from trees up to 400years old and [...] in diameter, felled and split using only stone axes, wooden wedges, and mallets. The length, straightness, and lack of forks or branches in the pegs suggest that they were taken from coppiced woodland. Longitudinal log rails up to [...] long and [...] in diameter, made of mostly hazel and alder, were laid down and held in place with the pegs, which were driven at an angle across the rails and into the peat base of the bog. Notches were then cut into the planks to fit the pegs, and the planks were laid along the X shapes to form the walkway. In some places a second rail was placed {{on top of the}} first one to bring the plank above it level {{with the rest of the}} walkway. Some of the planks were then stabilised with slender, vertical wooden pegs driven through holes cut near the end of the planks and into the peat, and sometimes the clay, beneath. At the southern end of the construction smaller trees were used, and the planks split <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> to utilise the full diameter of the trunk. Fragments of other tree species including holly, willow, poplar, dogwood, ivy, birch, and apple have also been found.|$|E
