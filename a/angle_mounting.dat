5000|$|Robert Twigge {{describes}} the castle {{in the early}} 1900s as follows: [...] "The castle stands on a low rock, scarped {{to the west and}} had no outworks, (the bawn noted in 1675 having been removed by this time). The very perfect tower, measuring 33'6" [...] x 24', is in excellent preservation, having been inhabited in the last century. The pointed south door is defended by a shot-hole on the left and a murder hole above. The stair mounts round the s.w. angle, and at the 14th step a long corridor with 2 lights in the w. wall is reached. At the n. end a spiral staircase of 72 steps leads to the top. At the 12th step from the corridor another passage through the n. wall is reached. 5 curved steps at the s. end of the w. corridor lead to a similar passage along the s. wall over the porch and lodge. There is a handsome trefoil headed window of 2 lights in the s.w. angle and a garderobe to the s.e. <b>angle.</b> <b>Mounting</b> the spiral stair still higher other corridors, over the lower ones, in the w. and s. sides, are reached. There are 4 main stories under the stone vault forming the roof. The basement story has very deep recesses under the corridor and the 2 on the n. side have a narrow chamfered screen between them. A fireplace bears the date 1576, but this was of course a later addition to the building".|$|E
50|$|The Own Committee {{decided in}} 1905 that the heavy {{armament}} of Gilkicker, Stokes Bay and Browndown were only of use against ships that had forced the outer defences and such ships would be deterred by the inevitable damage they would incur. The 9.2 inch guns at Gilkicker and Browndown were therefore superfluous. The 6-inch guns at Gilkicker and at No.2 battery of the Stokes Bay Lines were also superfluous and ineffective. These guns {{were to be}} removed. A 1906 armament return shows that the 9.2 inch and 6 inch guns were still mounted but to be reduced. Corrections to August 1907 show them as dismounted. The barrack block was altered 1908-1910 by converting it to married quarters for Royal Engineers at nearby Fort Monckton. In 1916 the fort was armed with an early type of Anti-Aircraft gun, a 3-inch Quick Fire gun on a high <b>angle</b> <b>mounting.</b> This {{was placed in the}} eastern 9.2inch B.L. position on top of the fort. Trinity House had a small observation post on Fort Gilkicker after 1939. During World war Two the fort was briefly armed with a 40mm Bofors gun and Gun Laying Radar was fitted outside the fort to direct the guns of the nearby Gilkicker Anti-Aircraft gun site. In the build-up to D-day a signals unit occupied the fort and during the Normandy landings on June 9 over 1,000 signals were recorded for the day needing routing to over 1300 addresses. Later an average of 800 signals to almost 1,000 addresses were routed via Gilkicker. In 1956 Coast Defence was abolished and the fort was then used by the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works as a plumbers workshop. In November 1986 Hampshire County Council bought the fort, but not its surrounding earth bank. The fort was used as a building materials store and when proposals to restore and convert the fort for modern housing were explored in 1995 the fort was emptied.|$|E

40|$|Self-seeding is a {{promising}} approach to significantly narrow the SASE bandwidth of XFELs to produce nearly transform-limited pulses. The {{implementation of this}} method in the soft X-ray wavelength range necessarily involves gratings as dispersive elements. We study a very compact self-seeding scheme with a grating monochromator originally designed at SLAC, which can be straightforwardly installed in the SASE 3 type undulator beamline at the European XFEL. The monochromator design {{is based on a}} toroidal VLS grating working at a fixed incidence <b>angle</b> <b>mounting</b> without entrance slit. It covers the spectral range from 300 eV to 1000 eV. The optical system was studied using wave optics method (in comparison with ray tracing) to evaluate the performance of the self-seeding scheme. Our wave optics analysis takes into account the actual beam wavefront of the radiation from the coherent FEL source, third order aberrations, and errors from each optical element. Wave optics is the only method available, in combination with FEL simulations, for the design of a self-seeding monochromator without exit slit. We show that, without exit slit, the self-seeding scheme is distinguished by the much needed experimental simplicity, and can practically give the same resolving power (about 7000) as with an exit slit. Wave optics is also naturally applicable to calculations of the self-seeding scheme efficiency, which include the monochromator transmittance and the effect of the mismatching between seed beam and electron beam. Simulations show that the FEL power reaches 1 TW and that the spectral density for a TW pulse is about two orders of magnitude higher than that for the SASE pulse at saturation...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of Free Electron Lasers (FEL) as a fourth generation of light sources is a breakthrough. FELs {{operating in the}} X-ray range (XFEL) allow one to carry out completely new experiments that probably most {{of the natural sciences}} would benefit. Self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) is the baseline FEL operation mode: the radiation pulse starts as a spontaneous emission from the electron bunch and is being amplified during an FEL process until it reaches saturation. The SASE FEL radiation usually has poor properties in terms of a spectral bandwidth or, on the other side, longitudinal coherence. Self-seeding is a promising approach to narrow the SASE bandwidth of XFELs significantly in order to produce nearly transform-limited pulses. It is achieved by the radiation pulse monochromatization {{in the middle of an}} FEL amplification process. Following the successful demonstration of the self-seeding setup in the hard X-ray range at the LCLS, there is a need for a self-seeding extension into the soft X-ray range. Here a numerical method to simulate the soft X-ray self seeding (SXRSS) monochromator performance is presented. It allows one to perform start-to-end self-seeded FEL simulations along with (in our case) GENESIS simulation code. Based on this method, the performance of the LCLS self-seeded operation was simulated showing a good agreement with an experiment. Also the SXRSS monochromator design developed in SLAC was adapted for the SASE 3 type undulator beamline at the European XFEL. The optical system was studied using Gaussian beam optics, wave optics propagation method and ray tracing to evaluate the performance of the monochromator itself. Wave optics analysis takes into account the actual beam wavefront of the radiation from the coherent FEL source, third order aberrations and height errors from each optical element. The monochromator design is based on a toroidal VLS grating working at a fixed incidence <b>angle</b> <b>mounting</b> without both entrance and exit slits. It is optimized for the spectral range of $ 300 - 1200 $~eV providing resolving power above $ 7000 $. The proposed monochromator is composed of three mirrors and the grating. Start-to-end simulation as a case study of the self-seeded European XFEL performance with a proposed SXRSS monochromator is presented. It shows that the laser pulse power reaches a TW-level with its spectral density about eighty times higher than that of the conventional SASE pulse at saturation...|$|E

Street lights need more energy in winter than in summer due to longer winter nights. However, for a solar powered system, less energy is available in winter with less intense sunlight and shorter days. The <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> of panels has {{a great impact on}} the cumulative energy output of the panels. Our investigation shows that while a <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> of 23. 1 ° yields maximum energy collection in summer and minimum energy collection in winter, a <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> of 46. 5 ° increases the energy collection in winter and yields more or less uniform energy collection throughout the year. Assuming a panel efficiency of 16 %, an average cumulative energy output of 950 Wh/m 2 /day with about 5 - 8 % variation throughout the year has been found with a <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> of 46. 5 °. This results in about 9 % reduction in the panel size than that required with a <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> of 231 °. Moreover, installing a traffic sensor in the lighting system will allow detection of traffic density, thereby operating the lamps at different intensity levels as per requirements. This will save energy wastage in time of low or no traffic and will further relax the requirement on system size. Publishe...|$|R
