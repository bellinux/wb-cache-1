5|$|The battle {{resulted}} in a major Wallachian victory and disaster for Charles Robert, becoming {{a turning point in}} the politics of Hungary, which had to <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> hopes of extending the kingdom to the Black Sea. For Wallachia, the victory meant an increase in morale and the further evolution of the independent state.|$|E
5|$|These {{concerns}} were soon partially allayed. With {{the global economy}} doing well, China was able to <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> dollar peg in 2005, allowing a substantial appreciation of the Yuan up to 2007, while still increasing its exports. The dollar peg was later re-established as the financial crises began to reduce China's export orders.|$|E
5|$|A {{trademark}} dispute {{involving the}} owners of the identically named Burger King in Mattoon, Illinois led to a federal lawsuit; the case's outcome helped define the scope of the Lanham act and trademark law in the United States. An existing trademark held by a shop of the same name in South Australia forced the company to change its name in Australia, while another state trademark in Texas forced the company to <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> signature product, the Whopper, in several counties around San Antonio. The company was only able to enter northern Alberta, in Canada, in 1995, after it paid the founders of another chain named Burger King.|$|E

5|$|In 1797 the Escheat Movement was born. Under {{the scheme}} {{proposed}} by the movement, land would be forfeited to the Crown should proprietors default on their quitrents, and tenants would be given the option of either purchasing part of the forfeited land or leasing it from the Crown. Members of the movement won a large majority in the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island in 1802, and in 1803 a law to implement escheat {{was passed by the}} legislature. However, the government of the United Kingdom would not <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> principle of supporting property rights and refused to grant the bill Royal Assent.|$|E
5|$|In February 1922, the Albanian Parliament {{approved}} the Declaration of Minority Rights. However, the Declaration, {{contrary to the}} Protocol of Corfu, recognized minority rights only in a limited area (parts of Gjirokastër, Sarandë district and 3 villages in Himarë), without implementing any form of local autonomy. All Greek schools in the excluded area were forced to close until 1935, in violation of obligations accepted by the Albanian government at the League of Nations. In 1925, Albania's present borders were set, leading Greece to <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> claims to Northern Epirus.|$|E
5|$|In January 1748, Adams {{and some}} friends were {{inflamed}} by British impressment and launched The Independent Advertiser, a weekly newspaper that printed many political essays written by Adams. His essays drew heavily upon English political theorist John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, and they emphasized many of the themes that characterized his subsequent career. He argued that the people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights. He cited {{the decline of the}} Roman Empire as an example of what could happen to New England if it were to <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> Puritan values.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the last}} {{installations}} of the ride was at Six Flags New Orleans in 2003, having been relocated from the Japanese park Thrill Valley where it operated as Gambit from 1995 to 2002. In 2005 the effects of Hurricane Katrina caused Six Flags to <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> New Orleans park, and after standing unused for two years, the ride there was relocated to Six Flags Fiesta Texas, where it was refurbished and repainted. The ride reopened as Goliath on April 18, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Renaming Poole's as the Union Theater, Adler {{attempted}} {{to produce the}} most serious Yiddish-language theater New York had yet seen in the Yiddish Theater District, with plays such as Scribe's La Juive, Zolotkev's Samson the Great, and Sinckievich's Quo Vadis. However, after Thomashefsky became an enormous popular success in Moses Halevy Horowitz's operetta David ben Jesse at Moishe Finkel's National Theater, the Union Theater temporarily to <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> highbrow programming and competed head on, with operettas Judith and Holofernes, Titus Andronicus, or the Second Destruction of the Temple, and Hymie in America.|$|E
5|$|The JNA 5th Military District command {{instructed}} OG-1 {{to relieve}} blockaded JNA garrisons in the Karlovac and Zagreb areas. During {{the first stage}} of the advance, OG-1 intended to reach the Kupa River via Turanj (breaking through the ZNG positions) while the second stage relieved JNA garrisons blockaded in Karlovac. On 2 November OG-1 began artillery bombardment in the Karlovac area, forcing the 2nd Battalion of the 110th Infantry Brigade to <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> positions in Turanj the following day. The abandoned defences were occupied by elements of the brigade's 1st Battalion.|$|E

5|$|The {{generalized}} resistance {{caused the}} Soviet Union to <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> original plan {{to oust the}} First Secretary. Dubček, who had been arrested {{on the night of}} 20 August was taken to Moscow for negotiations. There, he and several other leaders (including all the highest-ranked officials President Svoboda, Prime Minister Černík and Chairman of the National Assembly Smrkovský) signed, under heavy psychological pressure from Soviet politicians, the Moscow Protocol and it was agreed that Dubček would remain in office and a programme of moderate reform would continue.|$|E
5|$|France did not <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> {{claims to}} Texas until November 3, 1762, when it ceded {{all of its}} {{territory}} west of the Mississippi River to Spain in the Treaty of Fontainebleau, following its defeat by Great Britain in the Seven Years' War. It ceded New France to Britain. In 1803, three years after Spain had returned Louisiana to France, Napoleon sold the territory to the United States. The original agreement between Spain and France had not explicitly specified the borders of Louisiana, and the descriptions in the documents were ambiguous and contradictory. The United States insisted that its purchase included all of the territory France had claimed, including all of Texas. The dispute was not resolved until the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819, in which Spain ceded Florida to the United States {{in return for the}} United States' relinquishing its claim on Texas.|$|E
5|$|Livingstone's {{administration}} {{founded the}} Greater London Enterprise Board (GLEB) to create employment {{by investing in}} the industrial regeneration of London, with the funds provided by the council, its workers' pension fund and the financial markets. Livingstone later claimed that GLC bureaucrats obstructed much of what GLEB tried to achieve. Other policies implemented by the Labour Left also foundered. Attempts to prevent the sale-off of GLC council housing largely failed, {{in part due to}} the strong opposition from the Conservative government. ILEA attempted to carry through with its promise to cut the price of school meals in the capital from 35p to 25p, but was forced to <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> plans following legal advice that the councillors could be made to pay the surcharge and disqualified from public office.|$|E

5|$|Nikephoros' scheme had backfired dramatically: {{instead of}} peace, {{a new and}} {{formidable}} foe {{had appeared in the}} Balkans, and {{a large part of the}} Bulgarian nobility appeared to side with the Rus' prince. The emperor, however, was murdered in December 969, and it fell to his successor, John I Tzimiskes (r. 969–976), to deal with the Rus' threat. Sviatoslav now turned his sights on Byzantium, and to John's entreaties for peace he allegedly answered that the Empire should <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> European territories to him and withdraw to Asia Minor. Tzimiskes himself was preoccupied with consolidating his position and with countering the unrest of the powerful Phokas clan and its adherents, and delegated the war in the Balkans to his brother-in-law, the Domestic of the Schools Bardas Skleros, and to the eunuch stratopedarches Peter. They were to winter in Thrace and raise an army, whilst sending spies to discover Sviatoslav's intentions.|$|E
5|$|The {{artillery}} fire progressively intensified until 23 June, while the RSK mobilised and counterattacked against the HV {{positions at the}} Miljevci Plateau. However, the mobilisation yielded only 227 additional troops, and the counterattack failed. An UNPROFOR assessment concluded the situation might deteriorate further and engulf all of the pink zones. To address the situation, UNPROFOR military commander Lieutenant General Satish Nambiar met with Deputy Prime Minister of Croatia Milan Ramljak and Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia General Anton Tus in Zagreb the same day, {{in order to discuss}} the developments on the Miljevci Plateau. Skirmishes continued on 24 June, accompanied by some {{artillery fire}}. Morale of the RSK troops plummeted though, causing a TO garrison based in nearby Trbounj to <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> barracks.|$|E
5|$|The slow-swimming leopard {{catshark}} generally {{spends the}} day resting inside caves or crevices, either {{alone or in}} groups. At night, it moves towards the shore to actively forage for small bony fishes, cephalopods, crustaceans, and polychaete worms. In False Bay, fishes {{are the most important}} prey type, followed by cephalopods and then the Cape rock lobster (Jasus lalandii). This shark has been observed attacking octopus and cuttlefish by seizing and tearing off tentacles with a twisting motion. Like its close relative the pyjama shark, it will temporarily <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> nocturnal habits {{to take advantage of the}} daytime mass spawnings of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi), which occur unpredictably year-round with a peak from October to December. The sharks lie motionless amongst the squids' egg masses with their heads hidden, and make sudden lunges at female squid that have descended to the sea floor to attach their eggs.|$|E

5|$|Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, {{all of the}} British Isles came to <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> former Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} lifestyle, to {{be replaced}} by the new agricultural subsistence of the Neolithic Age. Although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period, there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement, architectural styles, and the use of natural resources. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic way of life. Although witnessing some land clearance, Britain was largely forested in this period, and it is unclear what level of deforestation the area of Kent had experienced in the Early Neolithic; widespread forest clearance only took place on the chalklands of south-east Britain in the Late Bronze Age. Environmental data from the area around the White Horse Stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters {{subsequently}} {{decided to}} continue with the current practice of naming hurricanes after women, but developed a new set of names ahead of the 1955 season with the names Carol, Edna and Hazel retired for the next ten years. However, before the names could be written, a tropical storm was discovered on January 2, 1955 and named Alice. The Representative T. James Tumulty subsequently announced that he intended to introduce legislation that would call on the USWB to <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> practice of naming hurricanes after women, and suggested that they be named using descriptive terms instead. Until 1960, forecasters decided to develop a new set of names each year. By 1958, the Guam Weather Center had become the Fleet Weather Central/Typhoon Tracking Center on Guam, and had started to name systems as they became tropical storms rather than typhoons. Later that year during the 1958–59 cyclone season, the New Caledonia Meteorological Office started to name tropical cyclones within the Southern Pacific. During 1959 the US Pacific Command Commander in Chief and the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided that the various US Navy and Air Force weather units would become one unit based on Guam entitled the Fleet Weather Central/Joint Typhoon Warning Center, which continued naming the systems for the Pacific basin.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, a tax {{was placed}} on land owned by the proprietors. In {{exchange}} for collecting the tax, the government promised to <b>abandon</b> <b>its</b> attempts to enforce the payment of quitrents. In 1836, a bill was passed to place a penal tax on unoccupied land. Although the Colonial Office initially refused to recommend Royal Assent, comments by Lord Durham led the Privy Council to give Royal Assent to the bill in 1838. Despite the change in property arrangements in Prince Edward Island {{with the introduction of}} these taxes, tenants were still unable to take possession of their land. In 1830, Roman Catholics were given the vote, and in 1838 the Escheat Party won a large majority in the General Assembly. Another bill to implement escheat passed the lower house, but was rejected by the Legislative Council. The leader of the Escheat Party, William Cooper, travelled to London to meet the Colonial Secretary, but he was turned away without a meeting. Instead, the Secretary advised the Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island that the government would not recommend assent to any bill advocating escheat. The Escheat Movement disintegrated.|$|E
