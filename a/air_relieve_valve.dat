5000|$|The new {{lifeboat}} {{was of a}} self-righting, pulling and sailing type [...] and was 36 ft {{in length}} and a beam of 9 ft. The design encompassed air cases for reserve buoyancy, a low centre of gravity (iron drop keel), the ability to self-bail (<b>relieving</b> <b>valves)</b> and water ballast tanks which gave the lifeboat stability {{and the ability to}} self-right achieved {{as a result of the}} combination of these features.|$|R

Schreiner House, {{on the corner of}} Grace and New street. Olive was very happy in Hanover where the Karoo <b>air</b> <b>relieved</b> her asthma. She wrote to friends saying, ‘this is the prettiest village I have ever seen'.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the complex three-dimensional flowfield of an oxygen safety pressure <b>relieve</b> <b>valve</b> during an incident, with a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis. Specifically, the analysis will provide a flow pattern that would lead to the expansion of the eventual erosion pattern of the hardware, so as to combine it with other findings to piece together a most likely scenario for the investigation. The CFD model is a pressure based solver. An adaptive upwind difference scheme is employed for the spatial discretization, and a predictor, multiple corrector method is used for the velocity-pressure coupling. The computational result indicated vortices formation near the opening of the valve which matched the erosion pattern of the damaged hardware...|$|R
5000|$|The hotel {{became a}} {{destination}} for the international elite, King Edward VII of the UK stayed at the hotel {{several times in the}} 1900s. He described his rooms as charming, and found that the sea <b>air</b> <b>relieved</b> his breathing difficulties, however he complained that Biarritz itself was smelly, and asked for something to be done about the drains. In April 1908, H. H. Asquith came to the hotel for the king to make him prime minister of the UK in succession to Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who was dying.|$|R
60|$|The {{first attempt}} of the assailants was {{to burn the}} floor of the lower apartment. In order to effect this, they threw vast piles of straw into the basement. But ere the brand was applied, water had reduced the {{inflammable}} material to a black and murky pile. Still the smoke had nearly effected a conquest which the fire itself had failed to achieve. So suffocating indeed were the clouds of vapor which ascended through the crevices, that the females were compelled to seek a refuge in the attic. Here the openings in the roof, and a swift current of <b>air,</b> <b>relieved</b> them, in some degree, from its annoyance.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{numerical}} model is developed {{to investigate the}} fluid and dynamic characteristics of a direct-operated safety <b>relieve</b> <b>valve</b> (SRV). The CFX code {{has been used to}} employ advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques including moving mesh capabilities, multiple domains and valve piston motion using the CFX Expression Language (CEL). With a geometrically accurate CFD model of the SRV and the vessel, the complete transient process of the system from valve opening to valve closure is simulated. A detailed picture of the compressible fluid flowing through the SRV is obtained, including small-scale flow features in the seat regions. In addition, the flow forces on the disc and the lift are monitored and analyzed and the comparison of the effects of design parameters, are examined; including the adjusting ring position, vessel volume and spring stiffness. Results from the model allow the fluid and dynamic characteristics of the SRV to be investigated and shows that the model has great potential of assisting engineers in the preliminary design of SRVs, operating under actual conditions which are often found to be difficult to interpret in practice...|$|R
50|$|Most newer systems employ {{electromechanical}} or electronic controllers. In this scenario, {{the controller}} {{is connected to}} an electrical circuit that operates a solenoid attached to each valve (solenoid valve). When the solenoid is actuated, the water above the diaphragm is <b>relieved</b> and the <b>valve</b> opens.|$|R
50|$|The new {{lifeboat}} hull {{was constructed}} using the clench method fixed with copper fastenings. The keel was 4 in deep and 5 in wide, {{with an iron}} keel plate and a belt of cork. She was 35 ft long with a breadth of 10 ft. The inside depth was 4 ft. There were fourteen oars which were double banked and she was also equipped with a dipping lug sail. The lifeboat would be steered by either a rudder or sweep oars. Benjamin Bond Cabbell II had a watertight deck, with copper tubes and self-acting valves to release the water, and portable airtight cases round {{the sides of the}} boat between the deck and the thwarts. Cork-packed air-cases were placed under the deck in the wings of the lifeboat. These cases weighed 4.5 tons and drew 18 in of water clear of ballast. The boat had a relatively light construction with a high bow and a raking stem. The keel was curved, typical of the north country-designed lifeboats first built in the late eighteenth century. The water ballast tanks had ten <b>relieving</b> <b>valves</b> and the rudder was retractable to prevent it being damaged when beach launched or during the recovery procedure.|$|R

500|$|In November 1886 Rutherford {{visited the}} Canadian West {{for the first}} time when he {{travelled}} to British Columbia to investigate the disappearance of his cousin. The Rocky Mountains left a great impression on him, as did the coastal climate which he found [...] "very agreeable". He visited again in the summer of 1894, when he took the Canadian Pacific Railway across the prairies. Upon arriving in South Edmonton, he was excited by its growth potential and pleased to find that the dry <b>air</b> <b>relieved</b> his bronchitis. He resolved to settle there, and did so one year later, bringing his reluctant wife and his children, who arrived by train June 10, 1895. Within ten days of their arrival, Rutherford had opened a law office, purchased four lots of land, and contracted local builder Hugh McCurdy to build him a house. In July the family moved into their new four-room house, built on a single storey. In 1896 Rutherford became the town's only lawyer, as his [...] competition, Mervyn Mackenzie, had moved to Toronto.|$|R

5000|$|From {{the early}} days of United States missile crew {{operations}} until the late 1970s, the career field was closed to female personnel. Changes were implemented to allow for full female crews on both Titan II and Minuteman/Peacekeeper crews. In 1978 the restriction of having women on crew was lifted for the Titan ICBM. Recognizing the limitations in personnel scheduling, Strategic <b>Air</b> Command <b>relieved</b> restrictions on same-sex crew pairings, into [...] "mixed" [...] crews on January 1, 1988.|$|R
5000|$|Preinvasion {{strikes in}} the Palaus in September 1944 along with air attacks on Mindanao, the Visayas, and Luzon {{paved the way}} for the long-awaited return to the Philippines. On 6 October, <b>Air</b> Group 29 <b>relieved</b> <b>Air</b> Group 31, and Cabot sailed from Ulithi for raids on Okinawa to provide air cover for her task group during the heavy enemy attacks off Formosa on 12 and 13 October. Cabot joined the group which {{screened}} [...] "Cripple Division 1", [...] and [...] which had been torpedoed off Formosa, to the safety of the Carolines, then rejoined her group for continued air strikes on the Visayas, and the Battle of Leyte Gulf on 25 and 26 October.|$|R
60|$|It was one {{of those}} soul-stirring mornings in which Nature seems to smile. There was just enough of motion in the <b>air</b> to <b>relieve</b> the effect of what is called a dead calm. The ripple on the water caught the sun's rays, and, {{breaking}} them up, scattered them about in a shower of fragmentary diamonds. Fleecy-white clouds floated in the blue sky, suggesting dreams of fairy-land, and scents of sprouting herbage filled the nostrils, reminding one of the fast-approaching summer.|$|R
40|$|A newly {{described}} immediate complication after percutaneous pulmonary valvuloplasty is acute lung injury. Here {{we report}} {{a case of}} fatal acute lung injury after pulmonary valvuloplasty. The patient was a 26 -year-old woman, referred to a general hospital with the diagnosis of livercirrhosis. In her work-ups severe pulmonary stenosis was detected and so a decision was madeto <b>relieve</b> the <b>valve</b> stenosis. Despite the procedural success, the patient developed severe dyspneaand desaturation {{a few hours later}} and died within 3 days due to shock state. Although the definition, incidence or severity of acute lung injury after pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty is not yet clear, this is {{as far as we know}} the first mortality reported in literature. This presentation in our patient should prompt clinicians to consider a more aggressive approach at the first sight of this previously considered innocent complication...|$|R

50|$|In October 1940 the 102nd OS was {{inducted}} into active federal service at Miller Field {{as part of the}} United States Army <b>Air</b> Corps, <b>relieved</b> from assignment to its parent group, and assigned directly to the VII Corps. The Army relocated it to Fort McClellan, Alabama, shortly after its call up, then assigned it a year later to the 71st Observation Group. Initially it was assigned to antisubmarine patrols over the Gulf of Mexico. After the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the squadron was moved to Southern California, flying antisubmarine patrols over the Los Angeles coast until November 1942.|$|R

50|$|The {{airport was}} officially opened on 15 January 1961, with two runways, {{replacing}} the smaller Rome Ciampino Airport, which remains in service for some low cost airlines {{as well as}} domestic and charter operations. Despite being officially opened in 1961, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport had actually been in use since 20 August 1960. This was to help <b>relieve</b> <b>air</b> traffic that was congesting Rome Ciampino Airport during the 1960 Summer Olympics.|$|R
60|$|An April shower {{cleared the}} <b>air</b> and <b>relieved</b> the full {{hearts of the}} happy family; then of course {{everyone}} began to talk--Franz and Ludmilla in German with uncle, Emil and Mary with the aunts; and round this group gathered the young folk, clamouring to hear all about the wreck, and the rescue, and the homeward voyage. It {{was a very different}} story from the written one; and as they listened to Emil's graphic words, with Mary's soft voice breaking in now and then to add some fact that brought out the courage, patience, and self-sacrifice he so lightly touched upon, it became a solemn and pathetic thing to see and hear these happy creatures tell of that great danger and deliverance.|$|R
5000|$|The driving {{restriction}} {{during the}} Olympics {{was so successful}} in cleaning the <b>air</b> and <b>relieving</b> traffic congestion, that {{a modified version of}} the scheme was made permanent afterward in October 2008, now banning 20% of the vehicles on a given weekday instead of half the vehicles as implemented during the Olympics. Also a ban on heavy trucks from entering the city during the day was implemented, and the oldest most polluting automobiles, called [...] "yellow-label" [...] cars, after the sticker fixed to their windshields, are banned from entering the city center. In July 2009 a nationwide car scrappage program was implemented offering rebates for trade in old heavy polluting cars and trucks for new ones. , in addition to Beijing, another 11 Chinese cities have similar restriction schemes in place.|$|R
50|$|The Alabama International Airport Authority was a {{commission}} designated {{with the task}} of developing a proposal for a new international airport within the state in the 1990s. The airport was envisioned to <b>relieve</b> <b>air</b> traffic from Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport in addition to serving as a replacement for the existing Birmingham Airport. The $1.5 billion facility was to have seen its first phase complete and operational by 1999 but never received sufficient funding to be carried out.|$|R
