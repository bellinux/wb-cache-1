40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Difficulties in {{pediatric}} airway {{management are}} common {{and continue to}} result in significant morbidity and mortality. This review reports on current concepts in approaching {{a child with a}} difficult airway. RECENT FINDINGS: Routine airway management in healthy children with normal airways is simple in experienced hands. Mask ventilation (oxygenation) is always possible and tracheal intubation normally simple. However, transient hypoxia is common in these children usually due to unexpected anatomical and functional airway problems or failure to ventilate during rapid sequence induction. <b>Anatomical</b> <b>airway</b> problems (upper airway collapse and adenoid hypertrophy) and functional airway problems (laryngospasm, bronchospasm, insufficient depth of anesthesia and muscle rigidity, gastric hyperinflation, and alveolar collapse) require urgent recognition and treatment algorithms due to insufficient oxygen reserves. Early muscle paralysis and epinephrine administration aids resolution of these functional airway obstructions. Children with an 'impaired' normal (foreign body, allergy, and inflammation) or an expected difficult (scars, tumors, and congenital) airway require careful planning and expertise. Training in the recognition and management of these different situations as well as a suitably equipped anesthesia workstation and trained personnel are essential. SUMMARY: The healthy child with an unexpected airway problem requires clear strategies. The 'impaired' normal pediatric airway may be handled by anesthetists experienced with children, whereas the expected difficult pediatric airway requires dedicated pediatric anesthesia specialist care and should only be managed in specialized centers...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{diagnosis}} {{in cases}} of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenitis without parenchymal involvement of the lung is often difficult. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy {{may be due to}} a variety of benign or malignant reasons. Hence, it is important to establish a diagnosis and differentiate benign from malignant lymph nodes. Aim of the work: To study the usefulness of fiberoptic bronchoscopy in diagnosis of patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Patients and methods: The present study included 30 patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. All were subjected to written informed consent, full history taking, full clinical examination, tuberculin skin test, chest X-ray and CT chest. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy including autofluorescence bronchoscopy with mucosal biopsies, TBNA and bronchial lavage were also obtained. Results: 46. 7 % of the study patients were diagnosed as malignancy, 20 % diagnosed as sarcoidosis, 10 % diagnosed as TB, 3. 33 % diagnosed as reactive lymphadenitis and 20 % were undiagnosed. Observed <b>anatomical</b> <b>airway</b> abnormalities included vocal cord paralysis (16. 7 %), tracheal compression (3. 3 %), widening of main or second carina (80 %) and mucosal abnormalities (46. 7 %) in the form of nodules, infiltration with tumour tissue and unhealthy mucosa. Bronchial mucosal biopsy was the most useful method of diagnosis (56. 7 %) followed by TBNA (30 %) and finally BAL (13. 3 %). AFB has no cost effective value over WLB in detection of malignant lesions. Conclusion: The best diagnostic yield was obtained by combination of bronchial mucosal biopsy and TBNA techniques...|$|E
40|$|Visualizing {{information}} {{in three dimensions}} provides an increased understanding of the data presented. Furthermore, the ability to manipulate or interact with data visualized in three dimensions is superior. Within the medical community, augmented reality is being used for interactive, three-dimensional (3 D) visualization. This type of visualization, which enhances the real world with computer generated information, requires a display device, a computer to generate the 3 D data, and a system to track the user. In addition to these requirements, however, the hardware must be properly integrated to insure correct visualization. To this end, we present components of an integrated augmented reality system consisting of a novel head-mounted projective display, a Linux-based PC, and a commercially available optical tracking system. We demonstrate the system with the visualization of <b>anatomical</b> <b>airways</b> superimposed on a human patient simulator...|$|R
40|$|Proton {{therapy has}} become an {{increasingly}} more common method of radiation therapy, with the dose sparing to distal tissue making it an appealing option, particularly for treatment of brain tumors. This study sought to develop a head phantom for the Radiological Physics Center (RPC), {{the first to be}} used for credentialing of institutions wishing to participate in clinical trials involving brain tumor treatment of proton therapy. It was hypothesized that a head phantom could be created for the evaluation of proton therapy treatment procedures (treatment simulation, planning, and delivery) to assure agreement between the measured dose and calculated dose within ± 5 %/ 3 mm with a reproducibility of ± 3 %. The relative stopping power (RSP) and Hounsfield Units (HU) were measured for potential phantom materials and a human skull was cast in tissue-equivalent Alderson material (RLSP 1. 00, HU 16) with <b>anatomical</b> <b>airways</b> and a cylindrical hole for imaging and dosimetry inserts drilled into the phantom material. Two treatment plans, proton passive scattering and proton spot scanning, were created. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) and film were loaded into the phantom dosimetry insert. Each treatment plan was delivered three separate times. Each treatment plan passed our 5 %/ 3 mm criteria, with a reproducibility of ± 3 %. The hypothesis was accepted and the phantom was found to be suitable for remote audits of proton therapy treatment facilities...|$|R

40|$|Perioperative airway {{problems}} frequently {{result in}} significant {{morbidity and mortality}} in children. Therefore, proficiency in airway management {{is one of the}} most important key elements in the safe conduct of paediatric anaesthesia. This review includes important anatomical and physiological aspects of the paediatric airway, challenges encountered, and their management with commonly available resources. The importance of early recognition and treatment of <b>anatomical</b> or functional <b>airway</b> obstruction using locally adapted algorithms is highlighted. Children deemed at risk of aspiration require a controlled rapid sequence induction with sufficiently deep anaesthesia, confirmed complete muscle paralysis and intermittent ventilation prior to tracheal intubation. The benefits of a supraglottic airway device and a cuffed tracheal tube in paediatric airway management are discussed. The primary goal of mastering the paediatric airway is to ensure oxygenation and ventilation. This requires intricate knowledge, regular practice and experience...|$|R

40|$|Inflammatory airway disease (IAD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} conditions affecting horses world-wide. Over-crowding, stabling conditions and exposure to irritants (such as bedding dust) have been thought to contribute to the development of IAD. Since the majority of sport horses in New Zealand are kept at pasture for prolonged periods, differing from intensive stabling conditions seen in other countries, variations in the type and frequency of respiratory pathologies might exist. In order to investigate this possibility, and determine the most common respiratory conditions affecting horses requiring endoscopic examination, this preliminary epidemiologic study was conducted. A retrospective analysis of 145 respiratory endoscopies was conducted including examinations made at 2 veterinary clinics from June 2010 to October 2012. Respiratory endoscopies results were initially classified as normal or abnormal. Abnormal results were further classified as: IAD, <b>anatomical</b> abnormalities, intermittent <b>airway</b> obstruction, trauma, miscellaneous abnormalities. Presence of tracheal secretions of any kind and quantity warranted classification as (IAD). Overall, 76. 5...|$|R

40|$|Background: Aerosol drug {{delivery}} via high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), bubble continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and synchronized inspiratory positive airway pressure (SiPAP) {{has not been}} quantified in spontaneously breathing premature infants. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare HFNC, bubble CPAP, and SiPAP on aerosol delivery in a simulated spontaneously breathing preterm model. Methods: A breath simulator was set to preterm infant settings (VT: 9 ml, RR: 50 bpm and Ti: 0. 5 sec) and connected to the trachea of an <b>anatomical</b> upper <b>airway</b> model of a preterm infant (DiBlasi) via collecting filter distal to the trachea. The HFNC (Fisher 2 ̆ 6 Paykel), Bubble CPAP (Fisher 2 ̆ 6 Paykel), and SiPAP (Carefusion) were attached to the model via their proprietary nasal cannula and set to deliver 5 cm H 2 O pressure. Albuterol sulfate (2. 5 mg/ 0. 5 mL) was aerosolized with a mesh nebulizer (Aeroneb Solo) positioned (1) proximal to the patient and (2) prior to the humidifier (n= 5). The drug was eluted from the filter with 0. 1 N HCl and analyzed via spectrophotometry (276 nm). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA), with p Results: At position 1, the trend of lower deposition across devices was not significant; however, in position 2, {{drug delivery}} with SiPAP was significantly lower compared to both HFNC (p= 0. 003) and bubble CPAP (p= 0. 008). Placement of the nebulizer prior to the humidifier increased deposition with all devices (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Conclusion: Aerosol can be delivered via all three devices used in this study; however, delivery efficiency of HFNC is better than the other CPAP devices tested. Device selection and nebulizer position impacted aerosol delivery in this simulated model of a spontaneously breathing preterm infant...|$|R

40|$|A patent {{upper airway}} is {{essential}} for survival. Increased age, obesity and some upper <b>airway</b> <b>anatomical</b> features are associated with failure to maintain upper airway patency during sleep, leading to obstructive sleep apnoea. However, many healthy subjects with these risk factors do not develop this condition. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine how anatomical factors and active dilator muscle contraction contribute to upper airway patency in healthy volunteers across a broad range of age and body mass index (BMI). A 'tagged' magnetic resonance imaging technique quantified respiratory-related motion of the anterior and lateral walls of the upper airway during quiet breathing in the supine position. Fifty-two subjects aged 22 − 68 years with BMI from 17. 5 to 40. 1 kg m⁻² were studied. Higher BMI was associated with smaller airway cross-sectional area at the level of soft palate (P < 0. 05). The genioglossus moved anteriorly to dilate the upper airway during inspiration. This movement increased with increasing BMI, increasing age, a smaller airway area, and steeper tongue-base angle (all P < 0. 05). Motion of the lateral upper airway at the soft-palate level was variable and less strongly linked to anatomical features of the upper airway. Multiple regression indicated that anterior genioglossus motion decreased with increasing airway area (P = 0. 03) and with increasing tongue-base angle (P = 0. 02). These data suggest that healthy humans, including those whose anatomy places them at increased risk of airway closure, can maintain upper airway patency by dynamically dilating the airway during inspiration. 12 page(s...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{retrospectively}} evaluate the prevalence, type, and location of incidental findings by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans. This study was performed to diagnose dental problems in the female population at Taibah University Dental Clinics (TUDC), KSA. MethodsA series of 150 consecutive CBCT scans were identified between January 2014 and February 2016. The record was retrieved from the Carestream (CS) R 4 Clinical and Practice Management Software database of TUDC. We retrospectively assessed them for incidental findings and then summarized and categorized them into five <b>anatomical</b> regions: nasopharyngeal <b>airway,</b> temporomandibular joint (TMJ), paranasal sinuses, dental findings, and alveolar bone region. We then analysed the frequency and percentage of findings in each category. ResultsA total of 248 incidental findings were reported in 83 of 90 scans (2. 76 findings/scan). The prevalence of all incidental findings was 92. 2 %. The most common incidental findings were located in the paranasal sinuses and alveolar area, each representing about a quarter (27. 4 %) of all of the findings. Other common findings were in the TMJ (22. 9 %), followed by those in the nasopharyngeal airway (10. 9 %), dental area (10. 5 %), and others (0. 8 %). ConclusionThis study confirms the high prevalence of incidental maxillofacial findings as shown by CBCT scans in a sample of female patients at TUDC. This emphasizes the need to thoroughly examine CBCT volumes for clinically significant findings inside and beyond the region of interest for the benefit of patients and the protection of practitioners...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Surgical {{lung biopsy}} {{has been studied}} in {{distinct}} populations, mostly going beyond clinical issues to impinge upon routine histopathological diagnostic information in diffuse infiltrates; however, detailed tissue analyses have rarely been performed. The present {{study was designed to}} investigate the prognostic contribution provided by detailed tissue analysis in diffuse infiltrates. METHODS: Medical records and surgical lung biopsies from the period of 1982 to 2003 of 63 patients older than 18 years with diffuse infiltrates were retrospectively examined. Lung parenchyma was histologically divided into 4 <b>anatomical</b> compartments: interstitium, <b>airways,</b> vessels, and alveolar spaces. Histological changes throughout these anatomical compartments were then evaluated according to their acute or chronic evolutional character. A semiquantitative scoring system was applied to histologic findings to evaluate the intensity and extent of the pathological process. We applied logistic regression to predict the risk of death associated with acute and chronic histological changes and to estimate the odds ratios for each of the independent variables in the model. RESULTS: Impact on survival was found for male gender (P = 0. 03), presence of diffuse alveolar damage (P = 0. 001), and chronic histological changes (P = 0. 0004) on biopsy. Thus, being male was associated with a slightly lower risk (O. R. = 0. 18; P= 0. 03) of dying than being female. Death risk was increased 17 times in the presence of acute histological changes such as diffuse alveolar damage and 2. 5 times in the presence of chronic histological changes. CONCLUSION: Detailed analysis of histological specimens can provide more than a nosological diagnosis: this approach can provide valuable information concerning prognosis...|$|R
40|$|The lungs are {{a complex}} organ {{consisting}} of two main <b>anatomical</b> features, the <b>airways</b> and alveoli. The airways form an arborized network of epithelial tubes surrounded by supporting tissue that conduct air {{in and out of}} the body. The airways connect to clusters of alveoli where gas exchange occurs between a thin epithelium and the surrounding vasculature. Any disruption to these tissues leads to the vast number of lung diseases that are known today. The number and severity of diseases affecting human lung development and adult respiratory function has stimulated great interest in deriving new in vitro models to study the human lung. Currently, a variety of animal models and cell culturing systems are used to model human lung development and adult homeostasis and disease. As described herein, I have taken two different approaches to understand how the lung develops normally. First, by utilizing mouse models, we have determined that a transcription factor, Sox 9, which is expressed during lung development, is necessary to establish the proper arborized network of airways in the adult. Second, I used human pluripotent stem cells, which are grown in a tissue culture dish and are capable to differentiate into any cell type of the human body, in order to investigate human lung development and to derive a model for human lung disease. Using human pluripotent stem cells, we have developed a three-dimensional human lung model system that consists of structures that are similar to the human lung, including complex, multicellular lung epithelium and supporting tissue. This dissertation will describe my efforts to exploit both animal models and human cells grown in vitro in order to better understand how the lung develops into the complex airway and alveolar structures of the adult lung...|$|R
40|$|Background: Difficult airway {{continued}} to be a major cause of anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. Successful airway management depends on direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Difficult laryngoscopy is a resultant of incomplete structural arrangements during the process of head positioning. Through clinical history,examination of the patients along with craniofacial indices alerts the anesthetist for difficult laryngoscopy. But it does not predict all causes of difficult laryngoscopy during pre-anesthetic evaluation. The maxillo-pharyngeal angle, an upper <b>airway</b> <b>anatomical</b> balance, was proposed for better understanding the pathophysiology of difficult laryngoscopy. In our study we have assess difficult laryngoscopy by electronically measuring maxillo-pharyngeal angles on a lateral cervical radiograph. This angle is normally greater than 100 o. Less than 90 o angle suggests either impossible or difficult direct laryngoscopy when all known craniofacial indices were within the normal range. Cervical radiographic assessment is a simple, economical, and non-invasive predictive method for difficult laryngoscopy. It should be used routinely along with other indices as pre-anesthetic airway assessment criteria to predict the difficult laryngoscopy. Context: Difficulties with airway management continue to be a major cause of anesthesia-related morbidity, mortality, and litigation. Pre-operative assessment of difficult laryngoscopy by the simple and non-invasive radiological method can help to prevent them. Aims: To assess the difficult laryngoscopy pre operatively by a simple and non invasive radiological method by electronically measuring maxillo-pharyngeal angle on a lateral cervical radiograph and it&#x 2032;s correlation with Cormack and Lehane grading. Settings and Design: This is a controlled, nonrandomized, prospective, cohort observation study. Patients and Methods: The 157 adult consented patients of ASA grade I to III of either sex, scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia with endo-tracheal intubation, were studied. The patients with identified difficult airway indices were excluded from the study. The maxillo-pharyngeal angle was electronically measured on a lateral cervical radiograph and was correlated with ease or difficulty of laryngoscopy under general anesthesia. Their degree of laryngeal exposure according to Cormack and Lehane classification grade was also noted. Statistical Analysis used: We performed univariate analyses to evaluate the association between the covariates and direct laryngoscopy. Results: In 148 patients (94. 28 &#x 0025;), the maxillo-pharyngeal angle was more than 100 o, in 7 patients (4. 45 &#x 0025;) it was less than 90 o, and in 2 patients (1. 27 &#x 0025;) the M-P angle was less than 85 o with normal craniofacial indices. When the MP angle was less than 90 o, the direct laryngoscopy was difficult which could be compared with to Cormack and Lehane classification grade III and IV. Conclusions: Lateral cervical radiographic assessment should be used as pre-anesthetic airway assessment criteria to predict the difficult laryngoscopy as it is a simple, safe and non-invasive method...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{methods are}} {{described}} for the automatic segmentation of anatomical structures from chest CT scans. First, {{a method to}} segment the lungs from chest CT scans is presented. Standard lung segmentation algorithms rely on large attenuation differences between the lungs and the surrounding tissue. Those methods are fast and perform well in {{a large percentage of}} cases. However, when abnormalities are present, such algorithms often fail. The few methods that have been proposed to handle such cases are too time consuming to be applied in clinical practice. We propose a method that combines two existing methods using automatic error detection. This method is shown to perform substantially better than a standard algorithm at a relatively low increase in computational cost. After the lungs are segmented, the fissures inside the lungs are extracted. The goal of the fissure extraction is to detect both the lobar and the accessory fissures. To this end, a supervised filter based on pattern recognition techniques is designed. It is shown that the filter is able to detect fissures with a high accuracy. In a next chapter, the lungs and fissures are used to identify lobes and segments in the lungs. First, the lobes are extracted using a supervised method that employs the lobar fissures and the lungs. Since there are no physical boundaries between the segments, a method is designed that assigns to each voxel a probability that it belongs to a segment based on the position in the lobe and the position relative to the closest fissure. It is shown that the method is able to assign a set of points in each scan to the correct segment with an accuracy comparable to the inter- and intra-observer agreement. In the next chapter, a method to extract the airways from chest CT scans is presented. From an automatically determined seed point in the trachea, a tree structure is grown based on a set of rules. Along with a segmentation of the bronchial tree, a method to extract the <b>anatomical</b> labels for <b>airway</b> branches up to segmental level is presented. The method is shown to perform well in different types of CT scans. The next chapter is a methodological chapter that describes two new frameworks for multi-atlas segmentation. The frameworks improve upon standard multi-atlas segmentation by including an automatic atlas selection, a stopping criterion that determines when no more improvement is expected, and a method to determine which area of a scan would benefit from additional atlases. The method is applied to segmentation of the heart in chest CT scans and, to show the general applicability, segmentation of the caudate nucleus in brain MR scans. In the final chapter, a method to segment the lobes is presented that combines the segmentation results and methodology described in previous chapters to enhance performance. The method incorporates contextual information using automatic lung, fissure, and bronchial tree segmentations. Shape information is incorporated using a multi-atlas approach. The method is shown to perform well in data with incomplete lobar fissures...|$|R
