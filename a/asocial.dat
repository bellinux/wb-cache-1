5|$|Koalas {{typically}} inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and {{the leaves}} of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are <b>asocial</b> animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay {{for the first six}} to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.|$|E
25|$|Actions or {{objects are}} not seen impure in themselves, rather the {{attitude}} is the determinant factor. Spiritual ignorance {{is the only}} impurity and knowledge is pure. As long as one is identified with the supreme consciousness, there is nothing impure. The adept is unaffected by any external impurity and makes use of what is reprehensible to attain transcendence. Here arises the antinomian and <b>asocial</b> character of Kaula and the left-handed forms of Tantra.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Final Fantasy XV {{and its associated}} media, Noctis has featured in multiple Final Fantasy-related products. Ever since his reveal, Noctis has been compared with other <b>asocial</b> characters seen in the series' other games based on his appearance. Following the release of both the game and its expanded media, Noctis has been positively received by journalists, with many noting his growth {{over the course of}} the story, and contrasting him against other Final Fantasy protagonists.|$|E
25|$|When {{he first}} arrived in Paris, he wrote home {{regularly}} to his mother, he sketched his nudes at the Académie Colarossi, and he drank wine in moderation. He {{was at that time}} considered by those who knew him as a bit reserved, verging on the <b>asocial.</b> He is noted to have commented, upon meeting Picasso who, at the time, was wearing his trademark workmen's clothes, that even though the man was a genius, that did not excuse his uncouth appearance.|$|E
25|$|If {{desire is}} repressed, {{it is because}} every {{position}} of desire, no matter how small, is capable of calling into question the established order of a society: not that desire is <b>asocial,</b> on the contrary. But it is explosive; there is no desiring-machine capable of being assembled without demolishing entire social sectors. Despite what some revolutionaries think about this, desire is revolutionary in its essence — desire, not left-wing holidays! — and no society can tolerate a position of real desire without its structures of exploitation, servitude, and hierarchy being compromised.|$|E
25|$|As {{the series}} progresses, Creek {{gradually}} changes from an <b>asocial</b> anorak {{to a man}} {{with a great deal of}} wit and charm. This helps to fuel the romantic thread between him and Maddy. Jonathan's trademark duffle coat worn in the first series was actually Alan Davies' own coat that he wore to the auditions; it helped him win the role, as the writer and producers thought it suited the character. After the first series, Jonathan's coat was supplied by the wardrobe department. Davies kept the original at his home, and wore it again for the 2009 New Year's special.|$|E
25|$|On 22 April German {{newspaper}} Bild {{announced that}} contestant Max Buskohl quit the competition due to RTL's rejection of his request {{to let his}} school band Empty Trash get a recording contract alongside him. Viewers had wondered about judge Dieter Bohlen's uncharacteristic behaviour when he gave an extremely critical review of Buskohl's performance on 21 April. Buskohl {{is alleged to have}} said that Bohlen was <b>asocial,</b> which explains Bohlen's negative reaction. Contestant Martin Stosch, who was eliminated on 21 April, remained as a contestant despite being voted off the week prior, replacing Buskohl. However, Buskohl's father Carl Carlton told Spiegel Online that his son already made his decision to leave on 19 April but waited until Sunday to make his announcement at request of RTL.|$|E
25|$|Born August 26, 1990 {{and named}} after his hated father {{who left the}} family, Tory is an <b>asocial</b> self-proclaimed genius with a {{photographic}} memory, adept at playing arcade games. So unchallenged by academics that he resorts to other means of exhausting his energy, he is overly obsessive when something or someone catches his interest, and keeps tabs on every event he deems significant in his life, recording the exact time (down to the minute or second) and place in which they occur. When Colin moves into the apartment across the street, he instantly becomes hooked on tracking his every move. He chases after Colin, blinding himself {{with the prospect of}} uncovering his secrets; he is unwilling to admit to himself the circumstances surrounding his feelings towards the other boy.|$|E
25|$|Other {{documented}} transcriptions from Heinrich Himmler include {{phrases such as}} “These researches… can {{be performed}} by us with particular efficiency because I personally assumed the responsibility for supplying <b>asocial</b> individuals and criminals who deserve only to die from concentration camps for these experiments.” Many of the subjects {{died as a result}} of the experiments conducted by the Nazis, while many others were executed after the tests were completed to study the effects post mortem. Those who survived were often left mutilated, suffering permanent disability, weakened bodies, and mental distress. On 19 August 1947, the doctors captured by Allied forces were put on trial in USA vs. Karl Brandt et al., commonly known as the Doctors' Trial. At the trial, several of the doctors argued in their defense that there was no international law regarding medical experimentation.|$|E

Robert Underwood Johnson described him as attaining a [...] "distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force." [...] His secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: [...] "his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul."

500|$|Although Hitler {{presented}} {{no evidence}} of a plot by Röhm to overthrow the regime, he nevertheless denounced the leadership of the SA. Arriving back at party headquarters in Munich, Hitler addressed the assembled crowd. Consumed with rage, Hitler denounced [...] "the worst treachery in world history". Hitler told the crowd that [...] "undisciplined and disobedient characters and <b>asocial</b> or diseased elements" [...] would be annihilated. The crowd, which included party members and many SA members fortunate enough to escape arrest, shouted its approval. Hess, present among the assembled, even volunteered to shoot the [...] "traitors". Joseph Goebbels, who had been with Hitler at Bad Wiessee, set the final phase of the plan in motion. Upon returning to Berlin, Goebbels telephoned Göring at 10:00 with the codeword [...] to let loose the execution squads on the rest of their unsuspecting victims.|$|E
500|$|Brown and American {{black bears}} are {{generally}} diurnal, {{meaning that they}} are active {{for the most part}} during the day, though they may forage substantially by night. Other species may be nocturnal, active at night, though female sloth bears with cubs may feed more at daytime to avoid competition from conspecifics and nocturnal predators. Bears are overwhelmingly solitary and are considered to be the most <b>asocial</b> of all the Carnivora. The only times bears are encountered in small groups are mothers with young or occasional seasonal bounties of rich food (such as salmon runs). Fights between males can occur and older individuals may have extensive scarring, which suggests that maintaining dominance can be intense. With their acute sense of smell, bears can locate carcasses from several kilometres away. They use olfaction to locate other foods, encounter mates, avoid rivals and recognise their cubs.|$|E
500|$|The blast beat is a drum beat {{characteristic}} of grindcore {{in all its}} forms, although its usage predates the genre itself, as it is native to jazz. In Adam MacGregor's definition, [...] "the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the kick drum, snare and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal." [...] Blast beats {{have been described as}} [...] "maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per second than sheer sonic violence." [...] Napalm Death coined the term, though this style of drumming had previously been practiced by others. Daniel Ekeroth argues that the blast beat was first performed by the Swedish group <b>Asocial</b> on their 1982 demo. D.R.I. ("No Sense"), S.O.D. ("Milk"), Sarcófago ("Satanas"), Sepultura ("Antichrist"), and Repulsion also included the technique prior to Napalm Death's emergence.|$|E
500|$|The Virginia Tech Review Panel report {{shed light}} on {{numerous}} efforts by Cho's family to secure help for him as early as adolescence. However, when Cho reached 18 and left for college, the family lost its legal authority over him, and their influence on him waned. Cho's mother, increasingly concerned about his inattention to classwork, his classroom absences and his <b>asocial</b> behavior, sought help for him during summer 2006 from various churches in Northern Virginia. According to Dong Cheol Lee, minister of One Mind Presbyterian Church of Washington (located in Woodbridge) Cho's mother sought help from the church for Cho's problems. Lee added that [...] " [...] problem needed to be solved by spiritual power... that's why she came to our church– because we were helping several people like him." [...] Members of Lee's church even told Cho's mother that he was afflicted by [...] "demonic power" [...] and needed [...] "deliverance." [...] Before the church could meet with the family, however, Cho returned to school to start his senior year at Virginia Tech.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Quistis {{stayed at}} an orphanage {{with most of}} the main characters. She then lived with foster parents, with whom she never {{developed}} any intimacy, before moving to Balamb Garden [...] at age ten. She became a SeeD at fifteen and an instructor two years later. Quistis initially joins Squall to prepare him for his upcoming field exam. She later takes Squall into her confidence and tells him personally about her demotion. As a result, Squall stops paying attention to her, which leads to Quistis asking if he is paying attention. Squall rudely tells her to go [...] "talk to a wall", a famous comical line in the game, and not to burden him with her problems. This furthers the player's perception of Squall's awkwardness and anti-social tendencies. When Irvine refreshes the main characters' memories about the orphanage, they remember that Squall's <b>asocial</b> behavior began when Ellone, an older sister figure to Squall, left the orphanage unexpectedly. As a result of these revelations, Quistis recognizes that her feelings for Squall are more sisterly than romantic. Later, she criticizes Squall when he nearly abandons Rinoa, his romantic interest.|$|E
500|$|Koalas are <b>asocial</b> {{animals and}} spend just 15 {{minutes a day}} on social behaviours. In Victoria, home ranges are small and have {{extensive}} overlap, while in central Queensland they are larger and overlap less. Koala society appears to consist of [...] "residents" [...] and [...] "transients", the former being mostly adult females and the latter males. Resident males appear to be territorial and dominate others with their larger body size. Alpha males tend to establish their territories close to breeding females, while younger males are subordinate until they mature and reach full size. Adult males occasionally venture outside their home ranges; when they do so, dominant ones retain their status. When a male enters a new tree, he marks it by rubbing his chest gland against the trunk or a branch; males have occasionally been observed to dribble urine on the trunk. This scent-marking behaviour probably serves as communication, and individuals are known to sniff {{the base of a}} tree before climbing. Scent marking is common during aggressive encounters. Chest gland secretions are complex chemical mixtures—about 40 compounds were identified in one analysis—that vary in composition and concentration with the season and the age of the individual.|$|E
500|$|Oliver was {{sometimes}} characterised as reclusive {{in both the}} artistic and social worlds. Her teacher and long-time associate Professor Ian Howard described her as having [...] "an underlying and at times painful distrust of the relationships {{that are part of}} our everyday lives". Close friend and gallerist, Roslyn Oxley, observed that she was [...] "very private. She stopped people entering her world a lot of the time." [...] Oliver's sister, Helen, had described her as a [...] "powerful and fragile person" [...] while biographer Fink observed [...] " [...] deeply <b>asocial</b> person, [...] nonetheless maintained longstanding friendships with a small coterie of people whom she trusted". The final period of Oliver's personal life was the subject of contradictory accounts. Oxley said that Oliver in 2006 experienced the end of a 20-year-long relationship, and obituarist Joyce Morgan, who spoke to Huon Hooke after Oliver's death, described Hooke as Oliver's [...] "former" [...] partner. though others writing shortly after her death did not indicate that the relationship with Hooke had ended, including an obituary by Howard, one written by art critic John McDonald, and tributes by her two biographers, Felicity Fenner and Hannah Fink.|$|E
500|$|The teenaged Evangelion {{pilots are}} ordered into battle by the steely Gendo Ikari, Shinji's {{father and the}} {{commander}} of Nerv. He abandoned Shinji and recalled him only {{to serve as an}} Evangelion pilot. Gendo salvaged the remains of his dead wife's soul and body to create Rei, whom he viewed as a mere tool at his disposal to defeat the Angels. Similar to Shinji, he is somewhat <b>asocial</b> and is afraid of being insulted by others and often runs away from such, often committing immoralities in the process. He is depicted as relentless in his drive to win, a man who [...] "takes drastic and extreme measures, by fair means or foul, or by hook or by crook, in order to accomplish his own purpose." [...] According to Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, the characters of Gendo and Fuyutsuki are based on Ed Straker and Alec Freeman of the television series UFO. Sadamoto designed the visual appearance of the characters so that their personalities [...] "could be understood more or less at a glance". The distinctive aesthetic appeal of the female lead characters' designs contributed to high sales of Neon Genesis Evangelion merchandise. The design of Rei in particular became so popular that the media referred to the character as [...] "Premium Girl" [...] due to the high sales of books with Rei on the cover.|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1979, Harold F. Brooks {{agreed that}} the main theme of the play, its very heart, is desire and its {{culmination}} in marriage. All other subjects are of lesser importance, including that of imagination and that of appearance and reality. In 1980, Florence Falk offered {{a view of the}} play based on theories of cultural anthropology. She argued that the play is about traditional rites of passage, which trigger development within the individual and society. Theseus has detached himself from imagination and rules Athens harshly. The lovers flee from the structure of his society to the communitas of the woods. The woods serve here as the communitas, a temporary aggregate for persons whose <b>asocial</b> desires require accommodation to preserve the health of society. This is the rite of passage where the <b>asocial</b> can be contained. Falk identified this communitas with the woods, with the unconscious, with the dream space. She argued that the lovers experience release into self-knowledge and then return to the renewed Athens. This is [...] "societas", the resolution of the dialectic between the dualism of communitas and structure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{alternative}} [...] "Happy Christmas" [...] gained usage in {{the late}} 19th century, and in the UK and Ireland is a common spoken greeting, along with [...] "Merry Christmas". One reason may be the Victorian middle class influence in attempting to separate wholesome celebration of the Christmas season from public insobriety and associated <b>asocial</b> behaviour, {{at a time when}} merry also meant [...] "intoxicated" [...] – Queen Elizabeth II is said to prefer [...] "Happy Christmas" [...] for this reason. In her annual Christmas messages to the Commonwealth, Queen Elizabeth has used [...] "happy Christmas" [...] far more often than [...] "merry Christmas".|$|E

[...] The Interior Ministry of Wuerttemberg argued that [...] "Gypsies [...] persecuted under the Nazis not for any racial reason but because of an <b>asocial</b> and criminal record". When on trial for his leadership of Einsatzgruppen in the USSR, Otto Ohlendorf cited the massacres of Romanis during the Thirty Years War as a historical precedent.|$|E
2500|$|Because of his <b>asocial</b> and secretive behaviour, Cavendish often avoided {{publishing}} his work, {{and much}} of his findings were not even told to his fellow scientists. In the late nineteenth century, long after his death, James Clerk Maxwell looked through Cavendish's papers and found things for which others had been given credit. Examples of what was included in Cavendish's discoveries or anticipations were Richter's law of reciprocal proportions, Ohm's law, Dalton's law of partial pressures, principles of electrical conductivity (including Coulomb's law), and Charles's law of gases. A manuscript [...] "Heat", tentatively dated between 1783 and 1790, describes a [...] "mechanical theory of heat". Hitherto unknown, the manuscript was analyzed in the early 21st century. Historian of science Russell McCormmach proposed that [...] "Heat" [...] is the only 18th century work prefiguring thermodynamics. Theoretical physicist Dietrich Belitz concluded that in this work Cavendish [...] "got the nature of heat essentially right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Steinbeck {{achieved}} {{his first}} critical success with Tortilla Flat (1935), a novel set in post-war Monterey, California, {{that won the}} California Commonwealth Club's Gold Medal. It portrays the adventures {{of a group of}} classless and usually homeless young men in Monterey after World War I, just before U.S. prohibition. They are portrayed in ironic comparison to mythic knights on a quest and reject nearly all the standard mores of American society in enjoyment of a dissolute life devoted to wine, lust, camaraderie and petty theft. In presenting the 1962 Nobel Prize to Steinbeck, the Swedish Academy cited [...] "spicy and comic tales about a gang of paisanos, <b>asocial</b> individuals who, in their wild revels, are almost caricatures of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table. It has been said that in the United States this book came as a welcome antidote to the gloom of the then prevailing depression." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{regard to}} {{relationships}} and her sexuality, Fox {{said that she}} has a general distrust and dislike of men, and that the perception of her as a [...] "wild and crazy sexpot" [...] is false because she is <b>asocial</b> and has only been sexually intimate with her [...] "childhood sweetheart" [...] and Brian Austin Green; she stated that she would rather stay at home instead of going out, and emphasized that she cannot have sex with someone she does not love. She is bisexual, and said she believes that [...] "all humans are born with the ability to be attracted to both sexes". [...] "I have {{no question in my mind}} about being bisexual," [...] Fox stated. [...] "But I'm also a hypocrite: I would never date a girl who was bisexual, because that means they also sleep with men, and men are so dirty that I'd never want to sleep with a girl who had slept with a man." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following its release, {{reviews of}} the Virtual Boy tended to praise its novelty, but {{questioned}} its ultimate purpose and longtime viability. The Los Angeles Times described gameplay as being [...] "at once familiar and strange." [...] The column praised the quality of motion and immersive graphics, but considered the hardware itself tedious to use and non-portable. A later column by the same reviewer found the system to be somewhat <b>asocial,</b> although it held out hope for the console's future. Reviewing the system shortly after its North American launch, Next Generation said, [...] "Unusual and innovative, the Virtual Boy {{can be seen as}} a gamble in the same way that the Game Boy was, but it's a lot harder to see the VB succeeding to the same world-conquering extent that the Game Boy did." [...] They elaborated that while the sharp display and unique 3D effect are impressive, aspects such as the monochrome display and potential vision damage to young gamers severely limit the system's appeal. They added that the software library was decent, but failed to capitalize on Nintendo's best-selling franchises (Zelda and Metroid games were absent, and the Mario games were not in the same style as the series's most successful installments) and lacked a system seller to compare with the Game Boy's Tetris.|$|E
2500|$|Leskov's novel, Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (written in Kiev in November 1864 and {{published}} in Dostoyevsky's Epoch magazine in January 1865) and his novella The Amazon (Otechestvennye zapiski, No.7, 1866), both [...] "pictures of almost unrelieved wickedness and passion", were ignored by contemporary critics but were praised decades later as masterpieces, containing powerful depictions of highly expressive female characters from different classes and walks of life. Both, marked by a peculiar [...] "Leskovian" [...] sense of humour, were written in the skaz manner, a unique folk-ish style of writing, which Leskov, along with Gogol, was later declared an originator of. Two more novellas came out at this time: Neglected People (Oboydyonnye; Otechestvennye Zapiski, 1865) which targeted Chernyshevsky's novel What's to Be Done?, and The Islanders (1866), about the everyday life of Vasilyevsky Island's [...] German community. It was in these years that Leskov debuted as a dramatist. The Spendthrift (Rastratchik), published by Literaturnaya biblioteka in May 1867, was staged first at the Alexandrinsky Theatre (as a benefit for actress E. Levkeeva), then in December at Moscow's Maly Theater (with E. Chumakovskaya in the lead). The play was poorly received for [...] "conveying pessimism and <b>asocial</b> tendencies." [...] All the while Leskov {{was working as a}} critic: his six-part series of essays on the St. Petersburg Drama Theater was completed in December 1867. In February 1868 Stories by M.Stebnitsky (Volume 1) came out in Saint Petersburg to be followed by Volume 2 in April; both were criticized by the leftist press, Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin in particular.|$|E
