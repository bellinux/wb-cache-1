Oxytetracycline (Terramycin) was discovered shortly afterwards by AC Finlay et al.; it came from a similar soil bacterium named Streptomyces rimosus. Robert Burns Woodward determined the structure of oxytetracycline, enabling Lloyd H. Conover to successfully produce tetracycline itself as a synthetic product. The development of many chemically altered antibiotics formed this group. In June 2005, tigecycline, the first member of a new subgroup of tetracyclines named glycylcyclines, was introduced to treat infections that are resistant to other antimicrobics including conventional tetracyclines. While tigecycline is the first tetracycline approved in over 20 years, other, newer versions of tetracyclines are currently in human clinical trials.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{completion}} of his studies, Conover joined Pfizer's chemical research department. He {{was part of}} a team exploring the molecular architecture of the broad-spectrum antibiotics Terramycin and <b>Aureomycin.</b> Both of these drugs had been discovered as natural products produced by actinomycetes. Working in conjunction with Harvard Professor R.B. Woodward, the team began to recognize {{that it was possible to}} chemically alter an antibiotic to produce other antibiotics that were effective in treating various types of illnesses. In 1952, he developed tetracycline in this way. Specifically, he was able to produce tetracycline by dechlorinating <b>Aureomycin</b> by catalytic reduction, that is, by substituting hydrogen for chlorine in chlortetracycline. His success led to the process being used to produce other superior structurally modified antibiotics. This is a standard practice in the industry today.|$|E
5000|$|Antibiotics {{first arrived}} on the medical scene in 1932 thanks to Gerhard Domagk; and coined the [...] "wonder drugs". The {{introduction}} of the sulfa drugs led {{to a decline in}} the U.S. mortality rate from pneumonia to drop from 0.2% each year to 0.05% by 1939. Antibiotics inhibit the growth or the metabolic activities of bacteria and other microorganisms by a chemical substance of microbial origin. Penicillin, introduced a few years later, provided a broader spectrum of activity compared to sulfa drugs and reduced side effects. Streptomycin, found in 1942, proved to be the first drug effective against the cause of tuberculosis and also came to be the best known of a long series of important antibiotics. A second generation of antibiotics was introduced in the 1940s: <b>aureomycin</b> and chloramphenicol. <b>Aureomycin</b> was the best known of the second generation.|$|E

He was professor of botany at the University of Missouri from 1902 to 1907 and thereafter held the chair of plant physiology at Cornell. He was {{vice president of the}} Botanical Society of America in 1912 and 1914. From 1917 to 1919, he was acting professor of biological chemistry at the Washington University Medical School. Surprisingly, he is best remembered for an achievement in another discipline occurring in the late 1940s, his discovery of chlortetracycline (<b>Aureomycin),</b> the first of the tetracycline antibiotics, from a soil bacterium growing in allotment soil.

50|$|After {{earning a}} diploma from the Harvard Medical School he joined Harvard {{as a junior}} faculty member. With Cyrus Fiske, he {{developed}} a method for the estimation of phosphorus in body fluids and tissues. He discovered the role of phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in muscular activity, which earned him an entry into biochemistry textbooks in the 1930s. He obtained his Ph.D. degree the same year. He joined Lederle Laboratories, a division of American Cyanamid (now a division of Wyeth {{which is owned by}} Pfizer), after he was denied a regular faculty position at Harvard. At Lederle, he developed a method to synthesize folic acid, Vitamin B9, based on work by Lucy Wills to isolate folic acid as a protective agent against anemia. After his work on folic acid and with considerable input from Dr. Sidney Farber, he developed the important anti-cancer drug methotrexate - one of the very first cancer chemotherapy agents and still in widespread clinical use. Subbarow also discovered the basis for hetrazan which was used by the World health Organization against filariasis. Under Subbarow, Benjamin Duggar made his discovery of the world's first tetracycline antibiotic, <b>aureomycin,</b> in 1945. This discovery was made {{as a result of the}} largest distributed scientific experiment ever performed to that date, when American soldiers who had fought all over the world were instructed at the end of WWII to collect soil samples from wherever they were, and bring the samples back for screening at Lederle Laboratories for possible anti-bacterial agents produced by natural soil fungi.|$|E

The results are summarized as follows: 1) In the culture of this aureomycin-resistant strain, there appeared a number of string-like cells, which might be considered to be produced by inhibition of cell division. No marked change could be observed in the characters of the colony and the staining of this strain. 2) Without addition of <b>aureomycin,</b> no difference was observed between the multiplication of this resistant strain and that of the sensitive stain.

It {{has been reported to}} be of value in many ocular conditions, used both locally and orally, but a critical assessment cannot be made as it has not been sufficiently widely used. <b>Aureomycin</b> is usually prescribed as the hydrochloride salt for oral use; this preparation is suitable for intra muscular injection although it is sometimes irritant, and it has also been used intra-venously without untoward effect. The hydrochloride salt, however, is too irritant to be used locally in the conjunctival sac; for this purpose a borate salt in 0. 5 per cent. solution, or <b>aureomycin</b> ethylene diamine in 1. 25 per cent. solution, have been employed.
