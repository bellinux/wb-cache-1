5|$|On 27 November 1095, Urban II called {{together}} the Council of Clermont in France. There, amid {{a crowd of}} thousands {{who had come to}} hear his words, he urged all present to take up arms under the banner of the Cross and launch <b>a</b> <b>holy</b> <b>war</b> to recover Jerusalem and the east from the 'infidel' Muslims. Indulgences were to be granted to all those {{who took part in the}} great enterprise. Many promised to carry out the Pope's command, and word of the Crusade soon spread across western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{accession}} of Heraclius, the Sassanid advance pushed {{deep into}} the Levant, occupying Damascus and Jerusalem and removing the True Cross to Ctesiphon. The counter-attack launched by Heraclius took {{on the character of}} <b>a</b> <b>holy</b> <b>war,</b> and an acheiropoietos image of Christ was carried as a military standard (similarly, when Constantinople was saved from a combined Avar–Sassanid–Slavic siege in 626, the victory was attributed to the icons of the Virgin that were led in procession by Patriarch Sergius about the walls of the city). In this very siege of Constantinople of the year 626, amidst the climactic Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the combined Avar, Sassanid, and Slavic forces unsuccessfully besieged the Byzantine capital between June and July. After this, the Sassanid army was forced to withdraw to Anatolia. The loss came just after news had reached them of yet another Byzantine victory, where Heraclius's brother Theodore scored well against the Persian general Shahin. Following this, Heraclius led an invasion into Sassanid Mesopotamia once again.|$|E
5|$|In early 1594, the Serbs in Banat rose {{up against}} the Ottomans. The rebels had, in the {{character}} of <b>a</b> <b>holy</b> <b>war,</b> carried war flags with the icon of Saint Sava. The war banners were consecrated by Patriarch Jovan Kantul, and the uprising was aided by Serbian Orthodox metropolitans Rufim Njeguš of Cetinje and Visarion of Trebinje (s. 1590–1602). In response, Ottoman Grand Vizier Koca Sinan Pasha demanded that the green flag of the Prophet Muhammed be brought from Damascus to counter the Serb flag and ordered that the sarcophagus containing the relics of Saint Sava be removed from the Mileševa monastery and transferred to Belgrade via military convoy. Along the way, the Ottoman convoy killed all the people in its path as a warning to the rebels. The Ottomans publicly incinerated the relics of Saint Sava on a pyre atop the Vračar plateau on April 27, 1595, and had the ashes scattered.|$|E

5|$|The Emir's {{reply was}} shrewd but frank. He noted Afghanistan's {{vulnerable}} strategic position {{between the two}} allied nations of Russia and Britain, and the difficulties of any possible Turco-German assistance to Afghanistan, especially given {{the presence of the}} Anglo-Russian East Persian Cordon. Further, he was financially vulnerable, dependent on British subsidies and institutions for his fortune and the financial welfare of his army and kingdom. The members of the mission had no immediate answers to his questions regarding strategic assistance, arms, and funds. Merely tasked to entreat the Emir to join <b>a</b> <b>holy</b> <b>war,</b> they did not have the authority to promise anything. Nonetheless, they expressed hopes of an alliance with Persia in the near future (a task Prince Henry of Reuss and Wilhelm Wassmuss worked on), which would help meet the Emir's needs. Although it reached no firm outcome, this first meeting has been noted by historians as being cordial, helping open communications with the Emir and allowing the mission to hope for success.|$|E
5|$|The Oath of the Vayuputras is a 2013 {{novel by}} Indian author Amish Tripathi {{and the final}} book in his Shiva trilogy. The book was {{released}} on 27 February 2013, through Westland Press and completes the mythical story about an imaginary land Meluha and how its inhabitants were saved by a nomad named Shiva. Starting from where the previous installment left off, Shiva discovers that Somras is the true evil in The Oath of the Vayuputras. Shiva then declares <b>a</b> <b>holy</b> <b>war</b> on {{those who seek to}} continue to use it, mainly the Emperors Daksha and Dilipa, who are being controlled by the sage Bhrigu. The battle rages on and Shiva travels to the land of Pariha to consult with Vayuputras, a legendary tribe. By the time he returns, the war has ended with Sati, his wife, being murdered. An enraged Shiva destroys the capital of Meluha and Somras is wiped out of history. The story concludes with Shiva and his associates being popularized as Gods for their deeds and accomplishments.|$|E
5|$|Rebellions {{can occur}} if {{the loyalty of}} a {{particular}} province falls too low, with a rebel army appearing in the province to attempt to assume control from the owners. Civil wars may also take place if several generals commanding large armies have sufficiently low loyalty. In {{the event of a}} civil war, the player is given the choice to back either the current rulers or the rebels. It had been planned to allow other factions who had established a prior claim to the throne by marriage to princesses to join in a civil war to claim the throne for themselves; however, this was never implemented. Naval warfare is carried out upon the campaign map, where ships can be built and organised into fleets. These fleets can be used to control the game's sea regions and form sea lanes, allowing trade and troop movement between provinces that have constructed a port. Fleets can engage in sea battles with foreign fleets, although unlike land battles these are resolved by the computer. Religion plays an important aspect in Medieval: Total War, with religious differences between the Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim factions affecting diplomacy and population loyalty. Catholic factions must also respond to the wishes of the Papal States; factions gain favour by refraining from hostilities with other Catholic nations and responding to Crusades, else they run the risk of excommunication. The option to launch <b>a</b> <b>holy</b> <b>war</b> {{in the form of a}} Crusade or Jihad is open to both Catholic and Muslim factions.|$|E

25|$|The Syrian Muslim Brotherhood {{issued a}} {{statement}} declaring Jihad against Russia obligatory (Fard 'ayn) upon all {{who are able to}} carry weapons after the Russian military intervention in Syria.

25|$|The {{campaign}} was {{planned to be}} a major affair. Wasif was to command upwards of ten thousand troops, consisting of the regular army, the mawlās and the shākiriyyah. In addition, a recruitment drive to gain volunteers for the {{campaign was}} ordered by al-Muntasir. On March 13, 862 a proclamation announcing the campaign was issued; it characterized the upcoming expedition as <b>a</b> <b>holy</b> <b>war</b> and extolled Wasif as a fine leader and a loyal servant of the caliph.|$|E
25|$|Previously, in 1462, the King {{sent word}} to his equerry {{that he should}} hire 8,000 cavalry to start <b>a</b> <b>holy</b> <b>war</b> against the Ottoman Empire only if the Venetians – {{according}} to their promise – covered the expenses (unfortunately for the Hungarians, this financial aid was postponed from time to time). The first major and mass conscription of mercenaries appeared during the Bohemian Wars (1468–78), whereas {{the core of his}} royal infantry, a force of 6,000–8,000 armed men, were incorporated into the Black Army (the origins of the moniker could also come from this era).|$|E

5000|$|While {{they differ}} in many particulars, these new {{perspectives}} on early Ottoman history {{share in the}} belief that early Ottoman expansion was not primarily fueled by an ideology of Islamic <b>holy</b> <b>war.</b> Historians now generally regard gaza as having been [...] "a much more fluid undertaking, sometimes referring to actions that were nothing more than raids, sometimes meaning <b>a</b> deliberate <b>holy</b> <b>war,</b> but most often combining a mixture of these elements." [...] This view also appears in Caroline Finkel's 2005 scholarly survey of Ottoman history, Osman's Dream.|$|R
25|$|The Ottoman Empire began massacring Assyrians in {{the nineteenth}} century, a time of {{friendly}} relations between the Ottomans and the British, who were defending the Ottomans from the Russian Empire's efforts to include under its protection the communities of Ottoman Orthodox Christians. In October 1914, the Ottoman Empire began deporting and massacring Assyrians and Armenians in Van. After attacking Russian cities and declaring war on Britain and France, the Empire declared <b>a</b> <b>holy</b> <b>war</b> on Christians. The German Kaiser and the German Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire directed and orchestrated the holy war, and financed the Ottomans' war against the Russian Empire.|$|E
25|$|The {{death in}} 1901 of Emir Abdur Rahman Khan led {{indirectly}} {{to the war}} that began 18 years later. His successor, Habibullah, was a pragmatic leader who sided with Britain or Russia, depending on Afghan interests. Despite considerable resentment over not being consulted over the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 (Convention of St. Petersburg), Afghanistan remained neutral during the First World War (1914–18), resisting considerable pressure from the Ottoman Empire when it entered the conflict {{on the side of}} Imperial Germany and the Sultan (as titular leader of Islam) called for <b>a</b> <b>holy</b> <b>war</b> against the Allies.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I {{prevented him from}} returning, however. As {{an expert on the}} East, the Foreign Office asked him to summarise the many different strategic ideas floating around in the ministry. The result was his Denkschrift betreffend die Revolutionierung der islamischen Gebiete unserer Feinde ("Memorandum on revolutionizing the Islamic territories of our enemies") of October 1914. The memo argued for enlisting the Sultan to call on the world's Muslims to engage in <b>a</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>War</b> against the colonial powers, France and Great Britain. To develop the necessary propaganda, the Nachrichtenstelle für den Orient (Intelligence Bureau for the East) was established in Berlin. Oppenheim became its head.|$|E

Saladin's army crushed the united forces of the kingdom in the Battle of Hattin on 4 July 1187.|$|R
25|$|Justinian's successors Maurice and Heraclius had {{to confront}} invasions of the Avar and Slavic tribes. After the devastations by the Slavs and the Avars, {{large areas of the}} Balkans became depopulated. In 626 Constantinople, by far the largest city of early medieval Europe, {{withstood}} a combined siege by Avars and Persians. Within several decades, Heraclius completed <b>a</b> <b>holy</b> <b>war</b> against the Persians by taking their capital and having a Sassanid monarch assassinated. Yet Heraclius lived to see his spectacular success undone by the Muslim conquests of Syria, three Palaestina provinces, Egypt, and North Africa which was considerably facilitated by religious disunity and the proliferation of heretical movements (notably Monophysitism and Nestorianism) in the areas converted to Islam.|$|E
25|$|Al-Husseini {{used his}} {{influence}} and {{ties with the}} Germans to promote Arab nationalism in Iraq. He was among the key promoters of the pan-Arab Al-Muthanna Club, and supported the coup d'état by Rashid Ali in April 1941. The situation of Iraq's Jews rapidly deteriorated, with extortions and sometimes murders taking place. When the Anglo-Iraqi War broke out, al-Husseini used his influence to issue a fatwa for <b>a</b> <b>holy</b> <b>war</b> against Britain. As the British advanced on the capital, the Farhud pogrom in Baghdad, led {{by members of the}} Al-Muthanna Club, which had served as a conduit for German propaganda funding, erupted in June 1941, following the Iraqi defeat and the collapse of Rashid Ali's government. The pogrom was rooted in antisemitic incitement during the preceding decade {{against the backdrop of the}} conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine.|$|E
25|$|Muslim powers became {{increasingly}} {{concerned about the}} rapid rise of a Christian state in southern Caucasia. In 1121, Sultan Mahmud b. Muhammad (1118–1131) declared <b>a</b> <b>holy</b> <b>war</b> on Georgia and rallied a large coalition of Muslim states led by the Artuqid Ilghazi and Toğrul b. Muhammad. The size of the Muslim army is still {{a matter of debate}} with numbers ranging from fantastic 600,000 men (Walter the Chancellor’s Bella Antiochena, Matthew of Edessa) to 400,000 (Smbat Sparapet’s Chronicle) to modern Georgian estimates of 250,000–400,000 men. All sources agree that the Muslim powers gathered an army that was far much larger than the Georgian force of 56,000 men. However, 12 August 1121, King David routed the enemy army on the fields of Didgori, achieving what is often considered the greatest military success in Georgian history. The victory at Didgori signaled the emergence of Georgia as a great military power and shifted the regional balance in favor of Georgian cultural and political supremacy.|$|E
