5|$|Cooking {{onions and}} sweet onions are better stored at room temperature, optimally {{in a single}} layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of {{three to four weeks}} and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from <b>apples</b> <b>and</b> pears. Also, they draw {{moisture}} from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay.|$|E

5|$|Eastman Kodak sued <b>Apple</b> <b>and</b> Research In Motion (RIM) in January 2010, filing two {{lawsuits}} against <b>Apple</b> <b>and</b> {{a complaint with}} the U.S. International Trade Commission against both <b>Apple</b> <b>and</b> RIM after the companies refused to pay royalties for use of Kodak's patents for digital cameras. Kodak alleged <b>Apple's</b> <b>and</b> RIM's phones infringed on patented Kodak digital imaging technology. Kodak sought an injunction against further imports into the United States of <b>Apple's</b> iPhone <b>and</b> RIM's BlackBerry. After Kodak filed an additional suit in January 2012 against <b>Apple</b> <b>and</b> another against HTC claiming infringement of four of its key patents, Apple filed a countersuit with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to block Kodak's efforts to use the disputed patents as collateral for loans. In the January complaint Kodak claimed violations of the same image preview technology at issue in the original dispute between Kodak, <b>Apple,</b> <b>and</b> RIM that is, as of 2012, pending before ITC. In March 2012, bankruptcy court judge Allen Gropper, overseeing Kodak's restructuring, denied Apple's request to file a patent complaint with the ITC over some of Kodak's cameras, photo frames, and printers. In July 2012, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Kodak did not infringe on Apple's patent technology for digital cameras, although a few days earlier Kodak lost its case before the ITC against <b>Apple</b> <b>and</b> RIM; Kodak announced it would appeal that decision.|$|R

5|$|The common {{blackbird}} is omnivorous, {{eating a}} wide range of insects, earthworms, seeds and berries. It feeds mainly on the ground, running and hopping with a start-stop-start progress. It pulls earthworms from the soil, usually finding them by sight, but sometimes by hearing, and roots through leaf litter for other invertebrates. Small amphibians and lizards are occasionally hunted. This species will also perch in bushes to take berries and collect caterpillars and other active insects. Animal prey predominates, and is particularly important during the breeding season, with windfall <b>apples</b> <b>and</b> berries taken more in the autumn and winter. The nature of the fruit taken depends on what is locally available, and frequently includes exotics in gardens.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Madonna {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Callaway Arts & Entertainment. The first release was the children's book, The English Roses, which was translated into 42 different languages over 100 countries. The book debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list, spending a total of 18 weeks there. Telling the story of five friends, The English Roses was deemed by critics as a reflection of Madonna's childhood, and received mixed reaction. Madonna's subsequent releases, Mr. Peabody's <b>Apples</b> <b>and</b> Yakov and the Seven Thieves, were both released within a year of The English Roses. They also debuted at number one on The New York Times list. Combined her first three children's books sold over 1.5million copies worldwide. She continued releasing other books like The Adventures of Abdi and Lotsa de Casha; all the five books released were included as part of an audiobook in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{to cut down}} the badnjak is the basic activity in the preparation part of the celebration. It can be performed by an individual, but it is usually a collective act accompanied by a festive procession that may include carriages and horsemen. After the tree {{to be used as}} the badnjak is cut down, it is adorned with straw, ribbons, oranges, <b>apples,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes with the Serbian flag. In some parishes more than one badnjak is used in the celebration, and a different tree is felled for each. Often bunches of leaved oak twigs are prepared to be distributed to the congregation gathered at the church. Each badnjak is festively taken to the church gate, often transported on carriages. The badnjak may be taken into the churchyard without any ceremony, or it may be followed by a procession, {{as is the case in}} parts of Republika Srpska and the Bay of Kotor.|$|E

The orchard is crossed by wide mown paths meeting at a central sundial. Originally four weeping elms were situated at {{the four corners of}} the garden, but they succumbed to Dutch elm disease in the early seventies and were replaced in 1973 by four weeping ash trees which make inviting 'houses'. The orchard can be viewed from the raised walk on its east side, another idea copied from Avebury Manor. A main path known as the Long walk is based on the Long Walk at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire, although it is on a smaller scale. It is a plain grassed walkway connecting the Raised Walk with the Pond Garden.|$|E

At this point, he tells Kurt that he has {{prostate}} cancer. He also has brought Blaine with him, who tries to win back Kurt's trust, but the trip is uneasy. When Kurt begins at NYADA, he struggles initially to find his place, and meets a student named Adam Crawford, a senior who wants to recruit him for his own show choir, Adam's <b>Apples,</b> <b>and</b> also seems interested in Kurt himself; Kurt eventually asks him out for coffee. While at Will and Emma's wedding, Kurt and Blaine hook up, leaving their relationship in a question, since Kurt is dating Adam, but not exclusive. When Kurt returns to New York, there is a snowstorm, leaving Kurt, Rachel, Santana, and Adam stuck together in the loft watching movies together. Santana strongly hints about Kurt's hook up with Blaine, and after they are back at school, Adam asks Kurt about his feelings for Blaine. Kurt says that he is desperately trying to get over Blaine, and Adam invites him to find their own romantic movie.|$|E
