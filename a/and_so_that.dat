5|$|Alexandra {{spent the}} spring of 1877 in Greece recuperating from a period of ill health and visiting her brother King George of Greece. During the Russo-Turkish War, Alexandra was clearly partial against Turkey and towards Russia, where her sister was married to the Tsarevitch, and she lobbied for a {{revision}} of the border between Greece and Turkey in favour of the Greeks. Alexandra and her two sons spent {{the next three years}} largely parted from each other's company as the boys were sent on a worldwide cruise as part of their naval and general education. The farewell was very tearful and, as shown by her regular letters, she missed them dreadfully. In 1881, Alexandra and Albert Edward travelled to Saint Petersburg after the assassination of Alexander II of Russia, both to represent Britain <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> Alexandra could provide comfort to her sister, who was now the Tsarina.|$|E
5|$|Angelou's {{primary role}} in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas was stage performer, but in The Heart of a Woman she changes {{from someone who}} uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer. Angelou makes this {{decision}} for political reasons as she becomes more involved with the civil rights movement, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> she can care for her son. For {{the first time in}} Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development. Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers {{for the first time in}} The Heart of a Woman. She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, but this is the first time she mentions female authors. Up to this point, her identification has been with male writers; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging feminism.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began to shift strategy. The UN began redeploying its forces to more {{defensible}} locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it would be more difficult to take UN personnel hostage. General Michael Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed land unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E

5|$|In the comedic poem Þrymskviða, Thor again plays {{a central}} role. In the poem, Thor wakes and finds that his {{powerful}} hammer, Mjöllnir, is missing. Thor turns to Loki, {{and tells him}} that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two go to the dwelling of the goddess Freyja, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> he may attempt to find Mjöllnir, Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak. Freyja agrees, and says she would lend it to Thor {{even if it were}} made of silver or gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.|$|E
5|$|In December 2001, aged 101, she {{fractured}} her pelvis in a fall. Even so, {{she insisted}} on standing for the National Anthem during the memorial service for her husband on 6 February the following year. Just three days later, her second daughter Princess Margaret died. On 13 February 2002, the Queen Mother fell and cut her arm in her sitting room at Sandringham House; an ambulance and doctor were called, and the wound was dressed. She was still determined to attend Margaret's funeral at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, two days later on the Friday of that week, even though the Queen {{and the rest of}} the royal family were concerned about the journey the Queen Mother would face to get from Norfolk to Windsor; she was also rumoured to be hardly eating. Nevertheless, she flew to Windsor by helicopter, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> no photographs of her in a wheelchair could be taken—she insisted that she be shielded from the press—she travelled to the service in a people carrier with blacked–out windows, which had been previously used by Margaret.|$|E
5|$|Nier was {{originally}} intended to be exclusive to the Xbox 360, but after deciding to also develop the game for PlayStation 3, the developers decided to further divide the Japanese release of the game. Nier Gestalt would be released for the Xbox 360, featuring the adult Nier (as in the international release for both platforms), while Nier Replicant, for the PlayStation 3, would feature the young Nier. The localizations for the game—in English, French, and German—were produced during development so {{that all of the}} versions could be released at the same time, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> Cavia and Square Enix could solicit feedback from North America and Europe on the game so that it would appeal to players outside Japan. Nier was officially unveiled in June 2009 at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009 for both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, to be developed by Cavia and published by Square Enix. It was directed by Yoko and produced by Takuya Iwasaki of Cavia and Yosuke Saito of Square Enix. Due to its high violence, the game was given a CERO D rating in Japan.|$|E

25|$|In the US, it is {{sometimes}} the practice to have some fox cubs chased but allowed to escape {{in order for them}} to learn evasion techniques <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> they can be tracked again in the future.

25|$|Some sidecar rigs {{allow the}} {{motorcycle}} to lean {{independent of the}} sidecar, and in some rigs, the sidecar even leans in parallel with the bike.

25|$|In the north, beyond Inverness, the A9 {{designation}} {{has been}} transferred {{in response to}} construction of new bridges across the Moray Firth (the Kessock Bridge), the Cromarty Firth and the Dornoch Firth; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the A9 leads not to John o' Groats but to Scrabster Harbour, Thurso, where a government-supported ferry service takes traffic to and from Stromness in Orkney. Therefore, various towns and villages which were on the A9 are now seriously distanced from this trunk road.|$|E
25|$|The Shar Pei's {{loose skin}} and {{extremely}} prickly coat were originally developed {{to help the}} dogs fend off wild boar, as {{they were used to}} hunt. Later, the breed was used for dog fighting; these enhanced traits made the Shar Pei difficult for its opponent to grab and hold on to, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> if it did manage to hold on, the Shar Pei would still have room to maneuver and bite back; when grabbed by any loose wrinkle, a Shar Pei can actually twist in their skin and face in their opponent's direction. In fighting, they would twist in their skin to bite the assailant back.|$|E

25|$|The {{victory of}} the Crescent City Company survived for only 11 years. By 1879, the State of Louisiana had adopted a new {{constitution}} prohibiting the state's ability to grant slaughterhouse monopolies, devolving regulation of cattle slaughter to parishes and municipalities, and banning the subordinate governmental units from granting monopoly rights over such activities. Having essentially lost its monopoly protection, the Crescent City Co. sued. That case ended in Butchers' Union Co. v. Crescent City Co. (1884), with the Supreme Court holding that Crescent City Co. {{did not have a}} contract with the state <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> revocation of the monopoly privilege was not a violation of the Contract Clause.|$|E
25|$|In 1950 Burou and {{his family}} moved to 71 Avenue d’Amade, {{situated}} across from Casablanca’s main park, now called Parc de la Ligue-Arabe. Burou and his wife “Nanou” built the Clinique du Parc on Rue Lapébie — the backstreet that ran parallel to the prestigious avenue. Burou wanted the building attached his office and private quarters so as “not to distance himself from his patients,” <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> he could be immediately available should a patient be admitted late at night. Additionally, this allowed his patients the choice of entering the clinic either from the elegant Avenue d’Amade main entrance or the more inconspicuous Rue Lapébie entrance.|$|E
25|$|K3, {{introduced}} in 1929, again by Giles Gilbert Scott, {{was similar to}} K2 but was constructed from concrete and intended for nationwide use. Cheaper than the K2, it was still significantly more costly than the K1 <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> remained the choice for low-revenue sites. The standard colour scheme for both the K1 and the K3 was cream, with red glazing bars. A rare surviving K3 kiosk can be seen beside the Penguin Beach exhibit at ZSL London Zoo, {{where it has been}} protected from the weather by the projecting eaves and recently restored to its original colour scheme. There is also one other in use at Rhynd in Perthshire.|$|E
