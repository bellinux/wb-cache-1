40|$|Whether {{phytophagous}} insects can speciate in sympatry {{when they}} shift and adapt to new host plants is a controversial question. One essential requirement for sympatric speciation is that disruptive selection outweighs gene flow between insect populations using different host plants. Empirical support for host-related selection (i. e., fitness trade-offs) is scant, however. Here, we test for host-dependent selection acting on apple (Malus pumila) - and hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) -infesting races of Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae). In particular, we examine whether the earlier fruiting phenology of apple trees favors pupae in deeper states of diapause (or with slower metabolisms/development rates) in the <b>apple</b> <b>fly</b> race. By experimentally lengthening {{the time period}} preceding winter, we exposed hawthorn race pupae to environmental conditions typically faced by apple flies. This exposure induced a significant genetic response at six allozyme loci in surviving hawthorn fly adults toward allele frequencies found in the apple race. The sensitivity of hawthorn fly pupae to extended periods of warm weather therefore selects against hawthorn flies that infest apples and helps to maintain the genetic integrity of the apple race by counteracting gene flow from sympatric hawthorn populations. Our findings confirm that postzygotic reproductive isolation can evolve as a pleiotropic consequence of host-associated adaptation, a central tenet of nonallopatric speciation. They also suggest that {{one reason for the}} paucity of reported fitness trade-offs is a failure to consider adequately costs associated with coordinating an insect’s life cycle with the phenology of its host plant...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} putative cases of host race formation in insects is that of the <b>apple</b> maggot <b>fly,</b> Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae). A principal cause of the controversy is lack of relevant data. In laboratory and field enclosure experiments, we compared the host acceptance behavior of sympatric populations of flies originating from naturally infested hawthorn (the native host) and apple (an introduced host) in Amherst, Massachusetts or East Lansing, Michigan. In general, hawthorn fruit were accepted for ovipositional attempts nearly equally by apple and hawthorn origin females, whereas apples were accepted much more often by apple than hawthorn origin females. Similarly, males of apple and hawthorn origin exhibited about equal duration of residence on hawthorn fruits as sites at which to acquire potential mates, while males of apple origin tended to reside substantially longer than males of hawthorn origin on <b>apples.</b> Irrespective of <b>fly</b> origin, both sexes always responded more positively to hawthorn fruit than to <b>apples.</b> Because all <b>flies</b> assayed were naive (ruling out effects of prior host experience of adults) and because tests revealed no influence of pre-imaginal fruit exposure on pattern of host fruit acceptance by females, the combined evidence suggests the phenotypic differences we observed in host response pattern between hawthorn and <b>apple</b> origin <b>flies</b> may have an underlying genetic basis. Further tests showed that while larval progeny of flies of each origin survived better in naturally growing hawthorn fruit than in naturally growing apples, there was no differential effect of fly origin on larval survival ability in either host.

The sphere body serves as a slow-release sugar reservoir. ^ First, the lethal and sublethal toxicity and the effects of tree sprays of the new insecticide imidacloprid on <b>apple</b> maggot <b>flies</b> were investigated. Females tested in the laboratory showed great mortality and reduced fecundity regardless of whether exposure was by oral or by surface contact. However, foliar sprays resulted neither in significant mortality nor reduced fecundity over a 7 -day period. Secondly, technical-grade or formulated insecticides were incorporated in sphere coating mixtures and evaluated for acute toxicity and residual effectiveness in laboratory, semi-field and field experiments. Results indicated that imidacloprid is a promising substitute for dimethoate as a fly killing agent on spheres. A wettable powder formulation of imidacloprid (Merit) proved better than a flowable formulation (Provado) in terms of residual efficacy. ^ Females feeding on imidacloprid-treated spheres exhibited very little tendency to forage within host plants or to lay eggs before dying, compared with females tested on dimethoate-treated spheres and control spheres. ^ The sucrose pH shown to stimulate maximal feeding response was 6. 4, with little feeding occurring at pH values of 5. 0 or less and 8. 0 or greater.

50|$|During {{the late}} 1990s and early 21st century a {{significant}} amount of discussion and debate has developed surrounding the role of supermarkets in the retailing of food and the impacts of supermarkets both on the supply and production of food. Due to the buying power of the large supermarket chains, they can put huge demands on producers, often pushing prices artificially low, whilst still making large profits on the food themselves, with some products selling at over 400% the price paid to, whilst farmers may only make 50p profit on each animal produced domestically. This buying power also allows supermarkets to transcend national boundaries in sourcing food. For example, in the UK, where the food market is highly dominated by supermarkets, only 25% of apples sold in supermarkets are produced domestically, with out-of-season Cox <b>apples</b> being <b>flown</b> 14,000 miles from New Zealand, despite the UK being a natural producer of apples.

In a series of experiments flies were first given an opportunity to learn which of two food odours was associated with good versus unpalatable taste; subsequently, their preference for the two odours was assessed with olfactory traps set up in the greenhouse.

These results support the notion that even small, short lived insects which are not central-place foragers make use of learned cues in their natural environments...|$|R

We mapped the 3 D vegetation architecture of four apple trees of varying morphology and age and recorded the paths of <b>apple</b> maggot <b>flies</b> Rhagoletis pomonella foraging for artificial fruit. We compared the observed movement with the one obtained from a random walk model on a graph to estimate both 1) the attraction radius and strength of a fruit and 2) the relative roles of the architecture of vegetation and of the strength of attraction of a fruit on the movement of flies. The attraction radius is the maximal distance at which a stimulus source biases the movement of individuals and the attraction strength measures how strong this bias is. Plant architectural complexity is defined according to both foliage density and its 3 D distribution within the canopy. A single fruit induces a bias in the path orientation of an insect that is at a large distance, relative to a tree volume, but it has no effect on the step length of moves. The plant complexity makes a minor contribution to defining the radius of the sphere of attraction, but a large contribution to the attraction strength. Conditional on visiting the location, the plant architecture plays a minor role compared to that of the presence of the fruit. Our findings show that the complexity of the environment can alter the use of sensory information, which has important implications for animal movements in complex environments.

Journal of Experimental Biology, 219 (17), 2613 - 2622. doi: 10. 1242 /jeb. 140566 The duration of dormancy regulates seasonal timing in many organisms {{and may be}} modulated by day length and temperature. Though photoperiodic modulation has been well studied, temperature modulation of dormancy has received less attention. Here, we leverage genetic variation in diapause in the <b>apple</b> maggot <b>fly,</b> Rhagoletis pomonella, to test whether gene expression during winter or following spring warming regulates diapause duration. We used RNAseq to compare transcript abundance during and after simulated winter between an apple-infesting population and a hawthorn-infesting population where the apple population ends pupal diapause earlier than the hawthorn-infesting population. Marked differences in transcription between the two populations during winter suggests that the 'early' apple population is developmentally advanced compared with the 'late' hawthorn population prior to spring warming, with transcripts participating in growth and developmental processes relatively up-regulated in apple pupae during the winter cold period. Thus, regulatory differences during winter ultimately drive phenological differences that manifest themselves in the following summer. Expression and polymorphism analysis identify candidate genes in the Wnt and insulin signaling pathways that contribute to population differences in seasonality. Both populations remained in diapause and displayed a pattern of up-and then down-regulation (or vice versa) of growth-related transcripts following warming, consistent with transcriptional repression. The ability to repress growth stimulated by permissive temperatures is likely critical to avoid mismatched phenology and excessive metabolic demand. Compared with diapause studies in other insects, our results suggest some overlap in candidate genes/pathways, though the timing and direction of changes in transcription are likely species specific...|$|R

40|$|Factors that {{interfere}} with attraction of <b>apple</b> maggot <b>flies</b> to traps were studied to provide a baseline for optimal trap deployment in apple orchards. ^ I found a four-fold increase in captures of mature flies when butyl hexanoate was added to unbaited red spheres. The addition of ammonium carbonate or food presence did not affect mature fly response to traps. Wild flies immigrating into commercial orchards were primarily mature and not hungry for protein. ^ Flies released outside blocks of apple trees of different sizes were intercepted in larger proportions by traps on small and medium sized trees than on similar traps on large trees. Overall trap performance was not strongly affected by orchard structure. ^ Released flies were recovered in larger proportions by traps on McIntosh trees than by traps on Red Delicious trees bearing larger darker fruit. Visual competition became stronger as Red Delicious apples grew in size and turned in color. Decreased trap apparency on Red Delicious trees was compensated for by increased residence time of wild flies. ^ Wild flies were captured in larger numbers by red spheres and Ladd traps than by yellow panels. Red spheres lost capturing power towards harvest when competing visually with red fruit. Ladd traps were not equally affected, but were more sensitive to trap positioning than red spheres. Red sphere effectiveness was restored after harvest. Optimal trap positioning {{may need to be}} revised. ^ Wild fly accumulation on traps on tees of different apple cultivars during the growing season revealed that fly distribution in orchards is not exclusively governed by fruit ripening but rather by apple maggot preferences for some cultivars. Although ripening stage affected the onset of increases in fly accumulation on traps, some cultivars never accumulated many flies during the growing season. ^ Apple maggot preferred to oviposit in sweet moderately firm fruit, but avoided ovipositing in excessively hard or soft fruit of different apple cultivars. Females also avoided fruit of late cultivars, even when sugar content and firmness were high and moderately high. Ovipositional cultivar preferences did not necessarily translate into greater fly accumulation on traps in our orchard study. ...|$|R
