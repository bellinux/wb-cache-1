5|$|A National Anthem Committee {{was formed}} in 1948, but it had {{difficulty}} finding suitable music and lyrics. The impending state visit of the Shah of Iran in 1950, resulted in the hasty adoption of a three stanza composition by Ahmed Ghulamali Chagla. Initially it was performed without lyrics for the Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan on August 10, 1950 and was approved for playing during the visit of the Shah. However, the anthem was not officially adopted until August 1954. The National Anthem Committee eventually approved lyrics written by Abu-Al-Asar Hafeez Jullandhuri and the new national anthem was first played properly on Radio Pakistan on August 13, 1954. Official approval was announced by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on August 16, 1954 followed by <b>a</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> the national anthem in 1955 involving eleven major singers of Pakistan including Ahmad Rushdi.|$|E
5|$|A record exists of <b>a</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> The Tempest on 1 November 1611 by the King's Men before James I and the English royal {{court at}} Whitehall Palace on Hallowmas night. The play {{was one of}} the six Shakespearean plays (and eight others for a total of 14) acted at court during the winter of 1612–13 as part of the festivities {{surrounding}} the marriage of Princess Elizabeth with Frederick V, the Elector of the Palatinate of the Rhine. There is no further public performance recorded prior to the Restoration; but in his 1669 preface to the Dryden/Davenant version, John Dryden states that The Tempest had been performed at the Blackfriars Theatre. Careful consideration of stage directions within the play supports this, strongly suggesting that the play was written with Blackfriars Theatre rather than the Globe Theatre in mind.|$|E
5|$|As {{mandated}} by the Olympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred. Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and <b>a</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> its national anthem. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theatre representative of its culture. The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100million, {{with much of the}} cost incurred in the artistic segment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The Smith-Waterman {{algorithm}} {{is one of}} the most widely used tools for searching biological sequence databases due to its high sensitivity. Unfortunately, the Smith-Waterman {{algorithm is}} computationally demanding, which is further compounded by the exponential growth of sequence databases. The recent emergence of many-core architectures, and their associated programming interfaces, provides an opportunity to accelerate sequence database searches using commonly available and inexpensive hardware. Findings Our CUDASW++ implementation (benchmarked on a single-GPU NVIDIA GeForce GTX 280 graphics card and a dual-GPU GeForce GTX 295 graphics card) provides <b>a</b> significant <b>performance</b> improvement compared to other publicly available implementations, such as SWPS 3, CBESW, SW-CUDA, and NCBI-BLAST. CUDASW++ supports query sequences of length up to 59 K and for query sequences ranging in length from 144 to 5, 478 in Swiss-Prot release 56. 6, the single-GPU version achieves <b>an</b> average <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> 9. 509 GCUPS with <b>a</b> lowest <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> 9. 039 GCUPS and <b>a</b> highest <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> 9. 660 GCUPS, and the dual-GPU version achieves <b>an</b> average <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> 14. 484 GCUPS with <b>a</b> lowest <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> 10. 660 GCUPS and <b>a</b> highest <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> 16. 087 GCUPS. Conclusion CUDASW++ is publicly available open-source software. It provides <b>a</b> significant <b>performance</b> improvement for Smith-Waterman-based protein sequence database searches by fully exploiting the compute capability of commonly used CUDA-enabled low-cost GPUs. </p...|$|R

5|$|Besides {{his work}} as a {{theatrical}} theorist and director, Takechi occasionally appeared in acting roles on the stage and screen. In his series of essays, Chronicles of My Life in the 20th Century, American author and translator of Japanese literature, Donald Keene mentions his own study of kyōgen at this time. In 1956, Keene appeared in <b>a</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> the kyōgen play Chidori with Takechi {{in the role of the}} sake shop owner, before an audience including such prominent authors as Tanizaki, Yasunari Kawabata and Yukio Mishima.|$|E
5|$|Bryce Dallas Howard (born March 2, 1981) is an American film actress, director, producer, and writer.

5|$|By 1827, {{the family}} had {{returned}} to Leipzig. Wagner's first lessons in harmony were taken during 1828–31 with Christian Gottlieb Müller. In January 1828 he first heard Beethoven's 7th Symphony and then, in March, the same composer's 9th Symphony (both at the Gewandhaus). Beethoven became a major inspiration, and Wagner wrote a piano transcription of the 9th Symphony. He was also greatly impressed by <b>a</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> Mozart's Requiem. Wagner's early piano sonatas and his first attempts at orchestral overtures date from this period.|$|E

Rendra, which convinced her to drop out of university and join the troupe. In 1974 she founded Satu Merah Panggung Theater, which performed adaptations of foreign works such as the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam and William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet– in the latter, Sarumpaet played the titular role.|$|E
5|$|Greek {{cultural}} influence did {{not disappear}} from the Parthian Empire, however, and {{there is evidence that}} the Arsacids enjoyed Greek theatre. When the head of Crassus was brought to Orodes II, he, alongside Armenian king Artavasdes II, were busy watching <b>a</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> The Bacchae by the playwright Euripides (c.480–406 BC). The producer of the play decided to use Crassus' actual severed head in place of the stage-prop head of Pentheus.|$|E

Wiesenthal indeed began searching for Karl Silberbauer and found him in 1963. When interviewed, Silberbauer admitted his role, and identified Anne Frank from a photograph as one of the people arrested. Silberbauer provided a full account of events, even recalling emptying a briefcase full of papers onto the floor. His statement corroborated the version of events that had previously been presented by witnesses such as Otto Frank.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Tippett {{was awarded}} the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society.

In 1979, with funds available {{from the sale of}} some of his original manuscripts to the British Library, Tippett inaugurated the Michael Tippett Musical Foundation, which provided financial support to young musicians and music education initiatives.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Sarumpaet, who was {{suffering}} domestic violence {{at home and}} discouraged by the market, left theatre and entered the film industry. After her divorce, which took several years and required records of her broken ribs to satisfy the religious courts, she returned to theatre in 1989 with <b>a</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> Shakespeare's Othello. Sarumpaet began working as a director in 1991, with the television serial Rumah Untuk Mama (House for Mother), which was broadcast on the state-owned television station TVRI. That same year, she adapted Antigone, a tragedy by French writer Jean Anouilh, in a Batak setting.|$|E

5|$|In September 1883 he went as a boarder to Field House Preparatory School in Rottingdean on {{the south}} coast of England, forty miles from Wotton. He was {{generally}} happy there, although he was shocked to encounter {{for the first time}} social snobbery and political conservatism which were rife among his fellow pupils. From there he moved on to the public school Charterhouse in January 1887. His academic and sporting achievements there were satisfactory, and the school encouraged his musical development. In 1888 he organised a concert in the school hall, which included <b>a</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> his G major Piano Trio (now lost) with the composer as violinist.|$|E
