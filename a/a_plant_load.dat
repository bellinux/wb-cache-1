40|$|The {{value of}} a gas fired power depends on the spark spread, defined as the {{difference}} between the price of electricity and the cost of gas used for the generation of electricity. We model the spark spread using a two-factor model, allowing mean-reversion in short-term variations and uncertainty in the equilibrium price to which prices revert. We analyze two types of gas plants: peak and base <b>load</b> <b>plants.</b> <b>A</b> peak <b>load</b> <b>plant</b> generates electricity when spark spread exceeds emission costs, whereas <b>a</b> base <b>load</b> <b>plant</b> generates electricity at all levels of spark spread. <b>A</b> base <b>load</b> <b>plant</b> can be upgraded to <b>a</b> peak <b>load</b> <b>plant.</b> First, we find the upgrading threshold for <b>a</b> base <b>load</b> <b>plant.</b> The upgrading threshold gives the optimal type of gas <b>plant</b> as <b>a</b> function of spark spread.

40|$|The {{value of}} a gas fired power plant depends on the spark spread, defined as the {{difference}} between the unit price of electricity and the cost of gas.

Metallurgical evaluation suggested that the mode of failure was localized attack by chlorine and/or hydrochloric acid at pipe connections (flanges) where concentrated solutions could accumulate. Most evidence pointed out that the failure resulted from corrosion attack due to condensation of hydrochloric acid. Misalignment of the pipe at the flange led to cold work which is also thought to accelerate the corrosion rate.
