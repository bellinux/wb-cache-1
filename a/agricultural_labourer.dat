5|$|Joseph Carey Merrick {{was born}} 5 August 1862 at 50 Lee Street in Leicester, to Joseph Rockley Merrick {{and his wife}} Mary Jane (née Potterton). Joseph Rockley Merrick (c.1838– 1897) {{was the son of}} London-born weaver Barnabas Merrick (1791– 1856) who moved to Leicester during the 1820s or 1830s, and his third wife Sarah Rockley. Mary Jane Potterton (c.1837– 1873) had been born at Evington, Leicestershire, her father being William Potterton, who was {{described}} as an <b>agricultural</b> <b>labourer</b> in the 1851 census of Thurmaston, Leicestershire. She is said to have had some form of physical disability and as a young woman worked as a domestic servant in Leicester before marrying Joseph Rockley Merrick, then a brougham driver, in 1861.|$|E

She was buried at Canewdon's St. Nicholas Church on 17 September. According to the 1891 census, Pickingill was still employed as an <b>agricultural</b> <b>labourer,</b> and was living in Canewdon with his married daughter Marry Ann and his granddaughter, Emily Wood. Records show that he was living in a rented cottage with an adjacent garden, and that in July 1899 the owner sold the property at auction. By 1901 he was listed as living on parish relief, with his two sons back living with him.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the coming four years, the Pickingill family moved to Canewdon, where another son, George, was born in 1876. The couple and their four {{children}} were then recorded in the 1871 census, where Pickingill was again listed as working as an <b>agricultural</b> <b>labourer.</b> In the 1881 census, the couple were recorded as living with two of their children, Mary Ann and George, and Pickingill was again identifying as a labourer. On 17 August 1887, a homeless man named James Taylor stole a jacket and pair of leather gloves from Pickingill. Taylor was arrested and brought to trial in Rochford on 24 August; in October, he pleaded guilty to the theft of the jacket, although not to those of the other items. He was sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour.|$|E

His family were wealthy landowners, but his father went bankrupt and lost all his land after acting as a loan guarantor. His older brother and two sisters went to find work, and he and his mother and father lived in a storehouse. His mother became an <b>agricultural</b> <b>labourer</b> and then died during his early childhood. His older brother was good at judo and became a policeman. One of his sisters became a nurse and would go on to work caring for atom bomb victims. The other sister married a Japanese-American and went to live in the USA.|$|E
25|$|Cutolo {{was born}} in Ottaviano, a {{municipality}} in the hinterland of Naples, in a family without ties in the Camorra. His fatherless youth was spent in a close-knit Catholic environment. His father was an <b>agricultural</b> <b>labourer</b> who for years tilled a field as a sharecropper {{as a means to}} support his family. While still a child, the landowner told Cutolo's father that the following year the field would be used for a different purpose and that his services were no longer required. In desperation, his father turned to the local Camorra boss, whose word was law in the village. The boss invited the Cutolo family to his home and promised to settle everything. A short time later, the landowner changed his mind and the contract was renewed.|$|E
25|$|The Sussex coast {{was greatly}} {{modified}} {{by the social}} movement of sea bathing for health which became fashionable among the wealthy {{in the second half}} of the 18th century. Resorts developed all along the coast, including at Brighton, Hastings, Worthing, and Bognor. At the beginning of the 19th century agricultural labourers' conditions took a turn for the worse with an increasing amount of them becoming unemployed, those in work faced their wages being forced down. Conditions became so bad that it was even reported to the House of Lords in 1830 that four harvest labourers (seasonal workers) had been found dead of starvation. The deteriorating conditions of work for the <b>agricultural</b> <b>labourer</b> eventually triggered riots, first in neighbouring Kent, and then in Sussex, where they lasted for several weeks, although the unrest continued until 1832 and became known as the Swing Riots.|$|E

40|$|The present {{paper has}} {{analyzed}} the {{mechanism by which}} farmers try {{to cope with the}} supply-demand gap of <b>agricultural</b> <b>labourers</b> during busy <b>agricultural</b> seasons in the face of growing shortage of <b>agricultural</b> <b>labourers.</b> The traditional mechanism of patron-client relationship between farmers and <b>agricultural</b> <b>labourers</b> has been dealt with in this regard. In this paper an attempt has been made to find answer to the following questions: What is the degree of attachment of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>labourers</b> with the employer? Is there any patron-client relationship between the employer and the employee? How effective is this relationship as a coping mechanism to mitigate the problem of supply-demand gap of <b>agricultural</b> <b>labourers?</b> The paper is based on a micro level study conducted in six villages of Uttar Dinajpur district, a predominantly agricultural and backward district of West Bengal. The study has suggested that to cope with the situation of supplydemand gap of farm labour, there is no other alternative but to adopt selective mechanization of farm activities. Some degree of mechanization is already there which is visibly on the rise. In future, there will be more inducement to undertake mechanical innovation to tackle the growing supply-demand gap in the farm labour.

500|$|William Hare was {{probably}} born in County Armagh, County Londonderry or in Newry. His age and {{year of birth}} are unknown; when arrested in 1828 he gave his age as 21, but one source states that he was born between 1792 and 1804. Information on his earlier life is scant, although {{it is possible that}} he worked in Ireland as an <b>agricultural</b> <b>labourer</b> before travelling to Britain. He worked on the Union Canal for seven years before moving to Edinburgh in the mid-1820s, where he worked as a coal man's assistant. He lodged at Tanner's Close, in the house of a man named Logue and his wife, Margaret Laird, in the nearby West Port area of the town. When Logue died in 1826, Hare may have married Margaret. Based on contemporary accounts, Brian Bailey in his history of the murders describes Hare as [...] "illiterate and uncouth—a lean, quarrelsome, violent and amoral character with the scars from old wounds about his head and brow". Bailey describes Margaret, who was also an Irish immigrant, as a hard-featured and debauched [...] ".|$|E

[...] When just 10 years old, Story ran away to accompany a lame fiddler on an excursion through the Scottish Borders for a month, and {{about a year later}} the family moved to Howtel, where Story attended the local school. [...] He later claimed that this was where [...] "I learned nearly all that I ever learned from a Master—namely to read badly, to write worse, and to cipher a little farther, perhaps than to the Rule of Three." [...] There he was introduced to Divine Songs for Children, and discovered a love of poetry while reading on the hills, where he was employed as a shepherd. [...] By 1820 he had moved to Gargrave in North Yorkshire where he opened a school, and in 1825 published a volume of poetry, Craven Blossoms. [...] Algernon Percy, the Duke of Northumberland, became a patron in 1857 and financed an edition of his works. [...] In 1859 Story was invited to Ayr for the centenary celebrations of Robert Burns, where he recited his poem on Burns. [...] The Bradfordian considered that [...] "he stands high among the minor poets of Great Britain, and many of his sweet lyrics will most assuredly descend to and be highly admired by posterity, and by none more than Yorkshiremen." ...|$|E

The suspension of capital punishment was reversed by 181 to 28, and a further amendment to retain the birch was also passed (though the Lords were later forced to give way on this issue). As the crime rate continued to rise, Goddard became convinced that the Criminal Justice Act 1948 was responsible as it was a 'Gangster's Charter'. He held a strong belief that punishment had to be punitive in order to be effective, a view also shared at the time by Lord Denning.|$|E

They moved to Barker Royde at Southowram and lived in an eighteenthcentury farmhouse called Barker Royde Farm; it incorporates a stone on which is carved [...] "WB 1849." [...] Close to the farmhouse, William built a four-storey mill called Barker Royde Mill, to make carding equipment and belting for the mechanised woollen industry. This mill was constructed during William Swinden Barber's childhood, when he would have witnessed and possibly been inspired by the works.

60|$|How {{far this}} can really happen {{it is very}} hard for anybody, {{especially}} a casual visitor, to discover in the present crisis. It is admitted that there is much Arab and Syrian labour employed; and this in itself would leave all the danger of the Jew as a mere capitalist. The Jews explain it, however, by saying that the Arabs will work for a lower wage, and that this is necessarily a great temptation to the struggling colonists. In this they may be acting naturally as colonists, but it is none the less clear that they are not yet acting literally as labourers. It may not be their fault that they are not proving themselves to be peasants; but it is none the less clear that this situation in itself does not prove them to be peasants. So far as that is concerned, it still remains to be decided finally whether a Jew will be an <b>agricultural</b> <b>labourer,</b> if he is a decently paid <b>agricultural</b> <b>labourer.</b> On the other hand, the leaders of these local experiments, if they have not yet shown the higher materialism of peasants, most certainly do not show the lower materialism of capitalists.
