We analyzed known group and diagnostic validity of our ankle <b>arthrometer.</b> Additionally, functional aspects of chronic ankle instability were evaluated in relation to anterior talar drawer. Methods: By manual stress testing, 41 functionally unstable ankles were divided as mechanically stable (n[*]=[*] 15) or mechanically unstable (n[*]=[*] 26). Ankle laxity was quantified using an ankle <b>arthrometer.</b> Stiffness values from the load displacement curves were calculated between 40 and 60 N.

40|$|Introduction: When {{assessing}} knee ligament injuries, clinicians {{consider the}} side-to-side difference in knee rotational-laxity {{to be an}} essential information. Although, normally, this difference is assessed through a qualitative physical examination, <b>arthrometers</b> are available that allow a quantitative and standardized assessmentby imposing a preset torque and by measuring the consequent femorotibial rotation. This rotation measurement is affected by uncertainties due to soft tissue deformation and to lack of control of the subject posture and muscle contraction level. Since measurements on right (R) and left (L) knees are carried out in separate tests, relevant results can be affected by different uncertainties that reflect on an inaccurate assessment of side-to-side differences. The aim {{of the present study}} was to overcome this limitation by designing and validating a non-invasive bilateral rotational kneearthrometer (BiRKA) that allows the simultaneous assessment of both knees while the subject assumes a symmetrical, controllable, and reproducible posture and minimizes soft tissue artifacts. Materials and methods: The BiRKA consists of ametal frame on which a compound pulley is mounted. A torque, the magnitude of which can be adjusted through a dynamometric lever, is applied to a central pulley and equally transferred to two pulleys the axes of which are aligned with the longitudinal axes of the subject’s tibias. The latter pulleys, which can rotate independently, are connected to the subject shanks through two modified Aircast boots which minimize ankle movement and soft tissue artifacts. The rotation of each pulley [ [...] . ] is measured by means of an electronic goniometer and an estimate of the difference [ [...] . ] between the R and L knee rotation is made available. The device allows the generation of both internal and external torques with the patient in either supine or prone position with different knee joint flexion angles. For validation purposes, measurements were carried out with the subject prone on a table with the knees flexed at 30 ◦. Belts were used to fasten the subject to the table. Accuracy assessment – Two subjects, with no apparent deficit at their knees, underwent simultaneous computed tomography scanning (CT) and BiRKA assessment. The CT scan provided benchmark values of knee rotation and the difference between these values and those provided by the BiRKA was assumed to be an estimate of the inaccuracy of the latter device. Two loading conditions were tested (external torque = 0 and 10 Nm). Repeatability assessment – Three subjects were assessed by the same operator three times in three different days (external torque = 10 Nm). Results: Accuracy – Femorotibial rotation angles were consistently overestimated by the BiRKA and, within each subject, R and L errors were comparable. The [ [...] . ] values measured using the CT scans and the BiRKA differed by 1. 1 ° for S 1 and 3 ° for S 2. Repeatability – The mean absolute deviation of was [ [...] . ] 1. 3 °, 0. 3 °, 1. 1 ° for the three subjects, respectively. Discussion : A non invasive device able to measure the sideto-side difference in knee rotational-laxity has been presented. Preliminary results have shown accuracy and repeatability levels that are adequate to reveal the presence and severity of knee lesions. Due to the presence of soft tissue deformation and undesired movement of adjacent joints, the actual femorotibial rotations were overestimated by the device. However, the inaccuracies that affected R and L knee rotations were similar and cancelled each other thus allowing for a reliable side-to-side difference evaluation. </br...|$|R
40|$|The human knee is a hinge joint, {{primarily}} facilitating locomotion. Knee joint instability, due to ligament injuries, is {{a result}} of direct or indirect trauma, non-anatomical stresses during pivoting movements about the knee, imbalanced landing during jumping and rapid deceleration during high intensity locomotion. Biomechanical indications of an unstable knee joint include decreased joint integrity, hyperlaxity, abrupt locking and catching combined with clicking noises during locomotion. Approximately, two hundred and fifty thousand ACL injuries occur in the United States of America annually. Current diagnostic procedures are subjective according to the clinician's experience. This potentially leads to misdiagnosis of the injury and improper treatment. Non-invasive diagnostic techniques make use of manual methods, MRI and laxity measurement devices (e. g. <b>arthrometers</b> and stress radiography devices). Laxity measurement devices (the focus of this study) determine ligament health by measuring their elasticity and stiffness. Directional tibial and fibular bone translation is induced by applying an external load to the joint. The bone translation is measured in relation to the load applied, which denotes ligament laxity. The Laxmeter is a novel, cost effective and radiolucent multi-ligament laxity measurement stress radiography device. This device facilitates the measurement of MCL and LCL laxity at multiple degrees of knee joint flexion, however, it lacks the essential means to perform the laxity measurement technique. The current study aims to redesign the Laxmeter to perform ACL, PCL, MCL and LCL laxity measurement procedures at multiple fixed degrees of knee joint flexion. The in vitro functional verification of the device was limited to (according to scope) a single cadaver trial; to validate functionality, structural integrity, usability as well as demonstrate the Laxmeter concept prior to a prospective full clinical trial. The redesigned Laxmeter Prototype consists of a load applicator capable of applying a 250 N load to various aspects of the proximal lower leg, to induce bone translation for laxity measurements. The load applicator is designed to integrate with the ergonomic patient support structure, the later potentially improving reproducibility and accuracy of the laxity measurement results. The cadaver trial demonstrated the device's capability of measuring the laxity of the ACL, MCL and LCL at predetermined knee flexion angles. To measure the ligament laxity, equal loads were applied to both proximal lower limbs independently. The bilateral average displacement of the tibia with respect to the femur for each ligament was noted. In the case of the ACL, the Laxmeter measured an average laxity of 3. 07 mm at 30 ° knee flexion and a load of 150 N. The average laxities for the MCL and LCL at 30 ° knee flexion and 150 N were 1. 11 mm and 2. 02 mm. The trial yielded preclinical results that were comparable with existing clinical and healthy cadaver based studies (using similar techniques), and suggests that the Laxmeter is capable of measuring the laxity of the ACL, MCL and LCL at various degrees of knee flexion. PCL laxity measurements could not be performed due to compromised structural integrity, which was essential to make the Laxmeter portable and lightweight. Future recommendations for the device include rotational ankle fixation; improved overall limb fixation; improved structural integrity to allow for PCL laxity measurements as well as further preclinical (functional) verification procedures prior to a full clinical trial...|$|R
40|$|The {{underlying}} {{study is}} a cross sectional study on {{the reliability of the}} KT 1000 <b>arthrometer</b> and the Lachman test to determine the within-session inter-rater reliability and intra-rater reliability of the KT 1000 <b>arthrometer</b> and the Lachman test. Twenty patients with a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) were examined in a single session each. During the assessment, two physical therapists measured the anterior-posterior translation of the knee using both the KT 1000 <b>arthrometer</b> and the Lachman test. One examiner performed a repeated measurement of each test for determination of intra-rater reliability. The examiners were blinded to the findings of their colleague. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to describe the degree of reliability of the measurements. High ICCs were found for the intra-rater reliability and the inter-rater reliability of the Lachman test (ICC = 1. 0 and 0. 77). For the KT 1000 <b>arthrometer</b> both ICCs were clearly lower (ICC = 0. 47 and 0. 14). The KT 1000 <b>arthrometer</b> shows inadequate reliabilities, even when measurements are repeated within a single measurement session. Contrastingly, the Lachman test is a reliable measurement to determine the anterior-posterior laxity of the ACL deficit knee.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare three types of {{objective}} measurement in Lachman test position and to validate a new measurement procedure. Twenty-three patients were evaluated after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction at 10 years' mean follow-up. The contralateral knee had a normal ACL. Both knees were compared using Lachman test, <b>arthrometer,</b> radiological drawer, and electromagnetic sensing device (EMS) measurements. The values were obtained by two trained orthopaedic surgeons independently. <b>Arthrometer</b> assessment was done with the Kneelax 3 (Biodex) at 88 and 132 N. Radiological drawer was measured with a load of 10 kg. EMS is composed of an electromagnetic transmitter and two sensors. Displacement of the sensors was measured along the three perpendicular axes of the transmitter. Data after processing give the displacement of the sensors perpendicular to the tibial axis. The load was applied on the calf perpendicular to the tibial axis with a 10 -kg counter-weight. Metallic objects must be avoided around the set-up. No significant difference between examiners was observed in clinical (P = 0. 45) or objective (P > 0. 3) measurements. The best correlation was obtained between <b>arthrometer</b> and EMS measurements (R = 0. 94). Arthrometric and radiological drawer were poorly correlated (R = 0. 65).

40|$|PURPOSE: {{the aim of}} {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence of graft tunnel position on both clinical outcome and instrumental knee stability in patients submitted to arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) graft. METHODS: thirty patients (24 men and 6 women) who underwent ACL reconstruction performed using an autologous bone-patellar tendon-bone graft were studied at a mean follow-up of 18 months. Clinical outcome was assessed on the basis of the Lysholm score, Tegner activity level, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective form and the Short Form- 36. Clinical outcomes were correlated with both femoral and tibial tunnel placement measured on standard anteroposterior and lateral knee radiographs, in accordance with established guidelines. RESULTS: tibial tunnel position on the lateral view correlated significantly with both the IKDC subjective form (r = - 0. 72; p< 0. 05) and the Lysholm score (r=- 0. 73; p< 0. 05). Tibial tunnel position on the lateral view also correlated with stability measured using a KT- 1000 <b>arthrometer</b> at 30 N of force (r= 0. 57; p< 0. 05). No correlation was found between α angle and anteroposterior (AP) laxity measured by KT- 1000 <b>arthrometer.</b> No significant correlation was found between femoral tunnel position (on either view) and Lysholm score, IKDC score and Tegner activity level. Similarly, no correlation was found between AP laxity measured by KT- 1000 <b>arthrometer</b> and femoral tunnel position.

The lower limb is placed in a rigid support with the knee at 0 ° of rotation, the restraining power being recorded. A 0 – 250 N thrust force is transmitted by a jack to the upper segment of the calf. This force is only applied {{in the absence of}} hamstring muscles contraction. Displacement of the anterior tibial tubercle is recorded using a sensor with a 0. 1 mm precision. HypothesisWe hypothesize that this knee laxity measurement device is more reliable and reproducible than other currently available arthrometers. Material and methodsDuring a first validation study, the GNRB® was compared to the KT- 1000 <b>arthrometer,</b> in 20 pairs of healthy knees, measurements being performed by two investigators. Variance analyses were carried out at 134  N. In a second clinical study, 21 complete ACL tears (the notch is devoid of ACL) and 24 partial ACL tears (anterior or posterior bundle tear and cicatricial ACL remnant in continuity) were tested with these arthrometers to exact a differential laxity threshold value between both knees at 250  N. Statistical analysis was subsequently performed using variance and ROC curves analysis. ResultsThe GNRB® <b>arthrometer</b> reveals to be significantly more reproducible than the KT- 1000, irrespectively of the tester's experience level. Moreover, unlike the KT- 1000, the achieved measurement is independent from the uninvolved side. Reproducibility of laximetry proves to be significantly better with the GNRB® than with the KT- 1000, wherever the examiner's experience stands and whatever the evaluated side condition could be. When differential laxity threshold value was 3 mm in complete ACL tears, sensitivity was 70 % and specificity 99 % at 134  N. Using a 1. 5 mm threshold value in ACL partial tears, the <b>arthrometer</b> sensitivity was 80 % and specificity was 87 % at 134  N. DiscussionReproducibility of laximetry was significantly better with the GNRB® than the KT- 1000 device, wherever the examiner's experience stands and whatever the evaluated side-condition could be. The GNRB® reports various supplementary advantages compared with other available laximeters. Good control of the investigated limb position in rotation, recording of translation in the absence of hamstring muscles contraction and in direct comparison with the KT- 1000 : reproducibility, constant pressure, arthrometry improved accuracy and automated measurements recording. The GNRB® might be used for {{diagnosis of}} partial and complete ACL tears and during follow-up of reconstructed or not ACL tears. Level of evidence: type II. Prospective comparative stud...|$|E
30|$|There was no {{patient with}} loss of knee flexion/extension {{exceeding}} 5 °, knee swelling, patellar ballottement, or positive Lachman or pivot shift test 1  year after surgery. The mean side-to-side difference of the anterior knee laxity {{measured by a}} KT- 2000 <b>arthrometer</b> was 0.4 ± 1.2  mm and the mean Tegner activity level scale was 6.8 (range, 3 – 9) at the final follow-up. Seventeen of the 22 patients returned to their former activity level, while 5 patients reduced their activity level because of graduation from school or fear of re-injury.|$|E
30|$|Whilst these {{researcher}} {{have suggested}} this reflex {{could be used}} as a measure of knee stability, it has not been implemented it as a clinical-related measure. To allow the reflex to be used widely in a clinical setting, it would need to be obtained reliably with commonly available instrumentation, the most common of which is the KT- 2000 <b>arthrometer.</b> Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of the KT- 2000 to evoke the ACL-hamstrings reflex, thus providing an objective measure of neuromuscular function in a clinical setting.|$|E
30|$|All {{trials were}} {{conducted}} by a physiotherapist (JA) experienced with the KT- 2000 <b>arthrometer</b> (MEDmetric Corp, San Diego, CA, USA). Surface EMG (Biometrics, Ltd., Newport, UK) electrodes {{were placed on the}} belly of the biceps femoris muscle in accordance with SENIAM guidelines (Hermens et al. 2000). The position and force outputs from the KT- 2000 were connected to the data acquisition system. These analogue traces were bandpass filtered at 20 – 500  Hz and sampled at 5  kHz. All data were stored on an encrypted computer for offline analysis.|$|E
30|$|Buckley et al. {{evaluated}} 25 {{patients with}} partial ACL tears at intermediate follow-up (minimum of 18  months), {{and found that}} 60 % had good or excellent results. Only 44 % of patients resumed sports activities at their pre-injury levels, and 72 % reported activity-related symptoms [34], whereas in our study all patients reported good and excellent results. Knee ROM returned to normal in all our cases, and objective measurements including anterior drawer test, pivot shift test, Lachman test and KT- 1000 <b>arthrometer</b> measurements, improved significantly to near normal levels.|$|E
30|$|Fifty-six {{patients}} were enrolled. The mean follow-up period was 19.3  months. All patients had posterolateral bundle (PLB) tears, and no anteromedial bundle (AMB) tears were found. The Lysholm score improved significantly from 78 (SD =  2.69) preoperatively to 96 (SD =  3.41) postoperatively (P value < 0.0001). The pivot-shift test, Lachman test and anterior-drawer test results were negative {{in all cases}} postoperatively. Anterior tibial translation from neutral was 4.9  mm (SD =  2.7) preoperatively, and decreased significantly to 2.1 (SD =  0.6) postoperatively, measured with a KT- 1000 <b>arthrometer</b> (P value < 0.00001).|$|E
