25|$|The TTC has {{recovered}} about 70% of its operating costs from the fare box in recent years. From its creation in 1921 until 1971, the TTC was self-supporting both for capital and operations (it {{even had to}} pay property taxes until 1967). Through the Great Depression and World War II, it <b>accumulated</b> <b>reserves</b> that allowed it to expand considerably after the war, both with subways and major steady growth of its bus services into the suburbs. It was not until 1971 that the Metro government and the province started to provide operational subsidies, required primarily due to rising costs of delivering transit to low-density suburbs in Metro Toronto and large wage increases. Deficits and subsidies soared throughout the 1970s and 1980s, followed by service cuts and a period of ridership decline in the 1990s, partly attributable to recession.|$|E

The principles adopted in the white paper remain binding unless either (or both) the Government or the President formally notifies the other that it no longer wishes to abide by them.|$|E
40|$|AbstractEven though several Latin American {{countries}} have shown recently poor economic performance, {{many of them}} have <b>accumulated</b> foreign exchange <b>reserves</b> from 2006 onwards. Conventionally, three reasons are given for international reserves accumulation: (1) payment of short-term debt, (2) payment of at least three months of imports, and (3) protection for an outflow of capital. However, the majority of the Latin American countries meet all three criteria. Why then do some Latin American countries continue to <b>accumulate</b> <b>reserves?</b> Our answer is that for some governments, hoarding might represent a social expression of wealth, following Marx's idea...|$|R

50|$|Not only do {{individuals}} <b>accumulate</b> <b>reserves</b> for precautionary purposes, {{but also}} sovereigns {{follow the same}} behavior. Saving rates of fast-growing emerging economies have been rising over time, leading to surprising “upstream” flows of capital from developing to rich countries. Carroll and Jeanne (2009) developed a model to test the relationship between economic development, the stock of savings and capital flows. The model was able to confirm the precautionary motive of sovereigns' accumulated assets (as a ratio to GDP) in response to risks of global imbalances.|$|R
50|$|Ratios {{relating}} {{reserves to}} other external sector variables are popular among credit risk agencies {{and international organizations}} to assess the external vulnerability of a country. For example, Article IV of 2013 uses total external debt to gross international reserves, gross international reserves in months of prospective goods and nonfactor services imports to broad money, broad money to short-term external debt, and short-term external debt to short-term external debt on residual maturity basis plus current account deficit. Therefore, countries with similar characteristics <b>accumulate</b> <b>reserves</b> to avoid negative assessment by the financial market, especially when compared to members of a peer group.|$|R

40|$|Prior {{research}} documented earnings {{management in}} for-profit settings. Nonprofit organizations {{are thought to}} pay less attention {{to the bottom line}} of the income statement. Earnings management research in nonprofit settings has therefore focused on the manipulation of expenses in order to improve efficiency ratios or taxable income, not reported earnings per se. Considering a different institutional setting characterized by the absence of such ratios and the presence of important subsidies, management of the actual bottom line is analyzed {{in the light of the}} importance of these subsidies. The results of our analyses suggest that organizations drive their results towards zero profit and that this is intensified by increased governmental funding when unmanaged results are positive. The relation between downward earnings management and the presence of subsidies is particularly evident for organizations whose <b>accumulated</b> <b>reserves</b> are high. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{decade after}} independence, the Malaysian {{government}} and central bank {{were faced with}} a series of challenges that forced them to develop an independent policy, leading {{to the end of the}} historic role of sterling in their international monetary regime. Like some economies today that are faced with <b>accumulated</b> <b>reserves</b> largely comprised of a depreciating currency (now the US$), Malaysia had to disentangle itself from sterling at a time when there were no clear alternatives since gold was scarce, the US$ was weak and Germany, Switzerland and Japan resisted the use of their currencies as national reserves. This paper uses new archival evidence to show that external obstacles as well as some misjudgement meant that this was only achieved in June 1972, 15 years after Merdeka. This process also reveals new evidence about the post-colonial relations between Malaysia and Britain and sheds new light on the neo-colonial interpretation of the first decade of independence. ...|$|E
40|$|Because {{pension plans}} have been marketed using {{outdated}} technical premises, Brazilian insurance companies find themselves required to identify additional resources to ensure their ability to meet future benefit payments obligations. When calculating the additional amount of this provision, the parameters used are: mortality and disability decrements, the structure of interest rates, financial performance, cancellation fees and conversion rates. The {{aim of this study}} is to present the estimation of conversion rates based on a Probit Model. The data for this study was obtained through the transfer of restricted data from the portfolio of a company with relevant activity in the Brazilian insurance market, including a group of 14, 511 individuals eligible for retirement in the period between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2009.

In turn, retirement age and the need for liquidity reduce the propensity to convert resources upon retirement...|$|E
