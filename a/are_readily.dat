5|$|Copper is a {{constituent}} of tobacco smoke. The tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals, such as copper {{from the surrounding}} soil into its leaves. These <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> absorbed into the user's body following smoke inhalation. The health implications are not clear.|$|E

5|$|Plants <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> {{propagated}} from seed. As seed {{is surrounded}} by irritating hairs within the pod, extraction requires care. Stem cuttings of semi-mature growth can be taken in late summer and require the application of rooting hormones and bottom heat.|$|E

5|$|Using modern catalysts, this {{reaction}} {{can have an}} acetic acid yield greater than 95%. The major side-products are ethyl acetate, formic acid, and formaldehyde, {{all of which have}} lower boiling points than acetic acid and <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> separated by distillation.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates, {{the main}} energy source in most rations, are usually fed {{in the form}} of hay, grass, and grain. Soluble {{carbohydrates}} such as starches and sugars <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> broken down to glucose in the small intestine and absorbed. Insoluble carbohydrates, such as fiber (cellulose), are not digested by the horse's own enzymes, but are fermented by microbes in the cecum and large colon to break down and release their energy sources, volatile fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Harrya chromapes <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> {{identified}} in the field by their rosy color, bright yellow stipe base, and reddish scabers on the stipe. Tylopilus subchromapes is a similar species found in Australia. Tylopilus ballouii has a more orangish cap and lacks the distinctive chrome-yellow stipe base. Harrya atriceps is a closely related rare species from Costa Rica. In contrast to its more common relative, it lacks reddish color in its stipe scabers and has a black cap, although it has a similar yellow stipe base.|$|E

5|$|Galiella rufa is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and grows}} either solitarily, but more usually in groups or in clusters on decaying hardwood branches and logs. The fungus fruits {{in late summer}} and autumn. The fungus has been noted to fruit readily on logs used for the cultivation of the shiitake mushroom. The fruit bodies <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> overlooked as they blend in with their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|In human anatomy, a bursa {{is a small}} pouch {{filled with}} {{synovial}} fluid. Its purpose is to reduce friction between adjacent structures. The prepatellar bursa {{is one of several}} bursae of the knee joint, and is located between the patella and the skin. Prepatellar bursitis is an inflammation of this bursa. Bursae <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> inflamed when irritated, as their walls are very thin. Along with the pes anserine bursa, the prepatellar bursa {{is one of the most}} common bursae to cause knee pain when inflamed.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that a range of sulfate and halide (primarily chloride and fluoride) compounds <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> mobilised from fresh volcanic ash.; It is considered most likely that these salts are formed {{as a consequence of}} rapid acid dissolution of ash particles within eruption plumes, which is thought to supply the cations involved in the deposition of sulfate and halide salts.|$|E

5|$|Other Marasmius {{species with}} a {{pinwheel}} arrangement of gills <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> distinguished from M.rotula by differences in color, including the orange M.siccus, the pink M.pulcherripes, and the rust M.fulvoferrugineus. Mycena corticola {{is smaller than}} Marasmius rotula, has a pale pink-brown cap, and is usually found growing singly or in small groups on bark near the base of living trees.|$|E
5|$|Rudimentary organs such as {{the human}} tailbone, now much reduced from their {{functional}} state, <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> understood as signs of evolution, the explanation being that they were cut down by natural selection from functioning organs when their functions were no longer needed, but make {{no sense at all}} if species are considered to be fixed. The tailbone is homologous to the tails of other primates.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds, {{by virtue}} {{of living in a}} geologically depositional {{environment}} (that is, in the sea where sediments <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> laid down), are well represented in the fossil record. They are first known to occur in the Cretaceous period, the earliest being the Hesperornithiformes, like Hesperornis regalis, a flightless loon-like seabird that could dive in a fashion similar to grebes and loons (using its feet to move underwater) but had a beak filled with sharp teeth.|$|E

5|$|The agaricoid {{species in}} Lactarius, Lactifluus, Multifurca, and Russula <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> {{distinguished}} from other gilled mushrooms by {{the consistency of}} their flesh, which is granular, brittle and breaks easily, somewhat {{like a piece of}} chalk. Russulaceae never have a volva, but a partial veil can be found in some tropical species. Gills are adnate to decurrent, and the colour of the spore print ranges from white to ochre or orange (with the brown-spored Lactarius chromospermus as an exception).|$|E
5|$|The direct {{precursor}} of dopamine, L-DOPA, can be synthesized indirectly from the {{essential amino acid}} phenylalanine or directly from the non-essential amino acid tyrosine. These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and so <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> available in food, with tyrosine being the most common. Although dopamine {{is also found in}} many types of food, it is incapable of crossing the bloodâ€“brain barrier that surrounds and protects the brain. It must therefore be synthesized inside the brain to perform its neuronal activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} however has to {{be considered}} {{on the basis of}} the fact that, for reasons which <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> understandable, he with the express approval of His Majesty enjoys this title and has been referred to as a Royal Highness on a formal occasion and in formal documents. In the light of precedent it seems clear that the wife of a Royal Highness enjoys the same title unless some appropriate express step can be and is taken to deprive her of it.|$|E

5|$|The two marbled newts <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> {{distinguished}} by size and colouration. In contrast, separating crested newt species based on appearance is not straightforward, but most {{can be determined}} {{by a combination of}} body form, coloration, and male crest shape. The Anatolian, Balkan, and southern crested newt however are cryptic, morphologically indistinguishable species. Triturus newts occupy distinct geographical regions (see Distribution), but hybrid forms occur at range borders between some species and have intermediate characteristics (see Hybridisation and introgression).|$|E
5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} {{titanium}} and titanium alloys are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the {{nominate}} form, A. p. kleinschmidti has slightly yellower, less olive, upperparts {{and brighter}} and yellower underparts between the breast streaking. A. p. littoralis may show pinkish underparts and a pale supercilium (eyebrow) in summer, thereby resembling the water pipit. Vagrant Eurasian rock pipits in winter <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> distinguishable from water pipits, but {{very difficult to}} assign to subspecies by appearance or measurements. The western populations {{are known to be}} nearly sedentary, so east of the Elbe basin vagrant Eurasian rock pipits are presumably mostly littoralis.|$|E
