Later, Fonda moved both toward darker epics such as Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West and lighter roles in family comedies such <b>as</b> <b>Yours,</b> Mine and Ours with Lucille Ball, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 54th Academy Awards {{for the movie}} On Golden Pond, his final film role.|$|E
500|$|... "The Food Wife" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer of The Simpsons Matt Selman. The writing process began around September 2010. According to Selman, the episode mainly revolves around Homer and Marge competing about who is perceived as the most fun by Bart and Lisa, a situation that he thinks parents can identify with in real-life. The episode also focuses heavily on foodies and food blogs. Selman {{said in an interview}} with New York magazine's Grub Street publication that the foodie culture is [...] "just a world that I always thought was funny and fascinating. The idea of food as not only something you enjoy eating, but as something that you are so passionate about that you're kind of bragging about it. 'I'm the one who discovered this particular Korean pork-neck soup restaurant,' and you can kind of claim that <b>as</b> <b>yours.</b> The blogging just feeds into that kind of territorial element that I always thought was inherently funny. And when I write Simpsons episodes, I try to start with a world I think is funny, and think, 'What's a good story we can tell in that world, using the characters that we have?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|On 4 January 1994, RAAF Wing Commander Brett Biddington, {{on behalf}} of the Chief of Air Staff, {{informed}} every civilian UFO groups around Australia that [...] "The number of reports made to the RAAF in the past decade had declined significantly, which may indicate that organisations such <b>as</b> <b>yours</b> are better known and are meeting the community's requirements." [...] Therefore, the RAAF was not going to investigate or collect any more public reports from that date on. Although the RAAF have officially removed themselves from the public report collection phase, there is evidence that internal investigations, by other government departments, still continued under the new title of Unusual Aerial Phenomena (UAP) or Unusual Aerial Sightings (UAS). Called the [...] "1996 - Defence Instructions (General) ADMIN 55-1", this 1996 Department of Defence (DOD) policy document better known as 'ADMIN 55-1' concerns UAS policy is still used.|$|E
2500|$|As President of the Council or Prime Minister, Thiers {{kept for}} himself {{the title of}} Foreign Minister. His most notable {{accomplishment}} was to obtain from Britain the return of Napoleon's ashes from Saint Helena. The idea was particularly pleasing to Thiers, because he had just begun writing {{a history of the}} Consulate and Empire, in twenty volumes. Rather than making the request public, he wrote to a personal English friend, Lord Clarendon, {{who was a member of}} the British government, saying: [...] "to keep a cadaver as a prisoner is not worthy of you, nor is it possible on the part of a government such <b>as</b> <b>yours.</b> The restitution of these remains is the final act of putting behind us the fifty years that have passed, and will be the seal placed on our reconciliation, and our close alliance." [...] The British Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, considered and accepted the request. The transfer was opposed by some in the French parliament, including Lamartine, who feared that it would stir republican sentiment in France, but it was welcomed by the population. A warship was dispatched to Saint Helena, and Thiers worked on the details of the design of the tomb and the plan of the parade that would carry it to the tomb, constructed within Les Invalides. The return of the ashes was a huge success, attracting enormous crowds in Paris. But by the time it took place Thiers was no longer in the government.|$|E
