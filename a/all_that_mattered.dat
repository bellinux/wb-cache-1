5|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Supreme Court, Justice Stephen Breyer stated that the department's belief was <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>mattered,</b> since the Court's precedent in this area holds it is unconstitutional for a government agency to discipline an employee (who does not work under a contract that explicitly permits such discipline) for engaging in partisan political activity, as long as that activity is not disruptive to the agency's operations. Even if Heffernan was not engaging in protected speech, he wrote, the discipline against him sent a message to others to avoid exercising their rights. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justice Samuel Alito, in which he agreed that Heffernan had been harmed, but his constitutional rights had not been violated.|$|E

25|$|Treaties {{obtained}} from local chiefs in Africa were not aimed at having them accept their subjugation − superior force did that (just {{as it had}} for the chiefs themselves, earlier) − but were solely to impress on rival colonial powers {{that they had the}} means to convince their own populations of the justice of any military action they might have to take to defend their claim to civilize the area, and that was <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>mattered.</b> The idea of democracy was spreading in Europe all throughout the nineteenth century, and, increasingly, governments were required to take account of public opinion. Public opinion in Europe could be a powerful motivator of colonial actions, as the Fashoda Incident a few years later demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|While {{employed}} as {{assistant to the}} professor of the maternity clinic at the Vienna General Hospital in Austria in 1847, Semmelweis introduced hand washing with chlorinated lime solutions for interns who had performed autopsies. This immediately reduced the incidence of fatal puerperal fever from about 10% (range 5–30%) to about 1–2%. At the time, diseases were attributed to many different and unrelated causes. Each case was considered unique, just as a human person is unique. Semmelweis's hypothesis, {{that there was only}} one cause, that <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>mattered</b> was cleanliness, was extreme at the time, and was largely ignored, rejected, or ridiculed. He was dismissed from the hospital for political reasons and harassed by the medical community in Vienna, being eventually forced to move to Budapest.|$|E
25|$|A {{major issue}} {{at all levels}} was whether the department's written Internet policy, or Duke's {{practice}} of just collecting the overage fee, was the operating reality of the OPD workplace.

And even if it was, it did not matter since the pager messages could be disclosed under the California Public Records Act. The plaintiffs argued that since Duke was the officer in charge of the contract with Arch, and the policy change that covered the pagers was never communicated in any definitive way, his assurance that he would not read Quon's messages if he reimbursed the city was <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>mattered.</b>|$|E

25|$|Manifest Destiny was {{the idea}} that it was God’s will for the United States to expand because it is Protestant, democratic, and white. It {{promoted}} the notion of American racial superiority, casting all nonwhites, including Native Americans, Mexicans, and blacks, as inferior beings. John L. O'Sullivan coined the phrase in 1845, first using it in his newspaper, the United States Democratic Review. Manifest destiny soon became an important element of American political rhetoric. It called for the expansion of the United States and was a justification used by southerners for extending slavery. An example of this was the annexation of Texas. President James K. Polk used the argument of manifest destiny to support his intentions of claiming Texas. In 1845, Texas entered the United States as the fifteenth slave state. Since whites were seen as superior beings, slavery didn’t seem like such a brutal practice. The whites were not the ones suffering, and that is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>mattered.</b>|$|E

Despite the presence of five court-appointed attorneys, Bundy again handled much of his own defense. From the beginning, he [...] "sabotaged the entire defense effort out of spite, distrust, and grandiose delusion", Nelson later wrote.

500|$|As a child, Fonda {{suffered}} from a poor self-image and {{lack of confidence in}} her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda.

He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved." [...] In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, [...] "It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout...I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die." ...|$|E

[...] This dichotomy could not have been illustrated better than a deal negotiated at the Senior Championship event. Tony Korfman wanted the money while Ernest Bennett wanted the glory. [...] Rather than leave their fates to chance, the two of them ensured they got what they wanted. In exchange for splitting the prize money, Korfman agreed to let Bennett win the bracelet.

500|$|Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times gave an {{unfavorable}} review. Although sex in popular music {{is considered a}} standard concept, Willman states the only reason the album would cause a reaction is because of Jackson's well-known conservative nature. He comments: [...] "So be it. Jackson's first album in four years is destined for a long ride at No. 1, not because it's any great piece of work, but largely for its aphrodisiacal aspirations." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "f musical variety and daring lyrics were <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>mattered,</b> Janet would make the grade. But the album {{has a lot to}} prove. It is the first delivery under her $40 million contract with Virgin, and its title—which translates as 'Janet, period'—is meant as a declaration of independence from her oddball siblings... She still sounds like a young woman from a male-dominated family who is searching for her identity and voice. Mostly, though, Janet sounds like a mess—period." [...] David Sinclair of The Times wrote: [...] "In the steamy, post-Madonna climate of the 1990s, Jackson is not about to let thoughts of love {{get in the way of}} the mechanics of lust, and like many of her superstar contemporaries she tends to confuse sex with soul." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alongside the Soviet Union's {{military}} and economic assistance, there was also political backing for Germany's aspirations. On July 19, 1920, Victor Kopp told the German Foreign Office that Soviet Russia wanted [...] "a common frontier with Germany, south of Lithuania, approximately on a line with Białystok". In other words, Poland was to be partitioned once again. These promptings were repeated over the years, with the Soviets always anxious to stress that ideological {{differences between the two}} governments were of no account; <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>mattered</b> was that the two countries were pursuing the same foreign policy objectives.|$|E
2500|$|Roberts next drew two conclusions. First, {{he found}} that a current labor dispute had existed as {{required}} under Section 2(3). Mackay Radio had {{argued that it was}} not at fault for the failed contract talks, but Justice Roberts concluded that was irrelevant. [...] "The wisdom or unwisdom" [...] of the union's decision to strike did not matter; <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>mattered</b> was that a current labor dispute existed. Second, Justice Roberts implicitly refused to involve the court in assessing whether Section 2(3) constitutionally made striking workers employees. Roberts quoted the relevant section of the NLRA, and concluded the workers were still employees under the plain meaning of the Act.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 July, Bethmann Hollweg told Count Roedern, the State Secretary for Alsace-Lorraine, that he couldn't {{care less}} about Serbia or alleged Serbian {{complicity}} in the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>mattered</b> was that Austria attack Serbia that summer, {{to result in a}} win-win situation for Germany. If Bethmann Hollweg's view was correct, an Austro-Serbian war would either cause a general war (which Bethmann Hollweg believed Germany would win) or cause the Triple Entente to break up. That same day, the Russian Ambassador to Austria-Hungary reported to St. Petersburg that, [...] "Information reaches me that the Austro-Hungarian government {{at the conclusion of the}} inquiry intends to make certain demands on Belgrade... It would seem to me desirable that at the present moment, before a final decision on the matter, the Vienna Cabinet should be informed how Russia would react to the fact of Austria's presenting demands to Serbia such as would be unacceptable to the dignity of that state".|$|E

2500|$|On March 12, 2010, {{during the}} 2010 Rey de Reyes event Dorian Roldan, son of AAA boss Joaquin Roldan {{announced}} that he, Dorian, {{was going to}} take control of the promotion and that he had some help to do so. That help turned out to be L.A. Park, the original La Parka returning to AAA after years and years of legal battles and threats. After unveiling himself during the show L.A. Park announced that he was siding with Konnan and Dorian Roldan, targeting the [...] "impostor Parka". In order to maintain the illusion that L.A. Park did not really work for AAA, L.A. Park claimed that he came to AAA to beat up La Parka, and since he had done that already he was not sure if he even felt like returning to AAA. L.A. Park did however return to an AAA ring as he had another brawl with La Parka on their April 18 television taping. During the event La Parka challenged L.A. Park to a match at Triplemania XVIII, under any stipulation the original Parka wanted. During AAA's television taping on April 30, 2010 L.A. Park accepted La Parka's challenge for a match at Triplemania XVIII. At an AAA press conference on May 12, 2010 it was announced that the match between the two would be for the rights to the name [...] "La Parka". At Triplemania XVIII L.A. Park faced La Parka in the main event of the show. Near the end of the match Park used a tombstone piledriver, a move that is illegal in Lucha Libre. Joaquin Roldan entered the ring, when L.A. Park attempted to use a steel chair on La Parka. When L.A. Park teased using the chair on Joaquin instead, Dorian entered the ring to protest, but was pushed down by Park, who then hit Joaquin with the chair, which caused Dorian to turn on him, hitting him with a steel chair three times. Halloween and Damián 666 from the Perros del Mal wrestling promotion run to the ring to chase Dorian Roldan away. Then they drag L.A. Park on top of La Parka before rúdo referee Hijo del Tirantes counts for three to give L.A. Park the victory. After the bell rings the rest of Los Perros del Mal, (including Park's son Hijo de L.A. Park) came to the ring to celebrate with L.A. Park who had won the rights to the name [...] "La Parka". After a couple of minutes a group of AAA wrestlers led by Octagón came to ringside and in combination with the arena security managed to remove Los Perros del Mal from the ring. La Parka was taken from the ring on a stretcher, not having moved since L.A. Park applied the piledriver. A bit later it was announced that the match results had been thrown out due to interference by Los Perros del Mal, but the following morning it was confirmed that Tapia had indeed won and would now be known as [...] "La Parka" [...] once again. However, on June 10 AAA announced that it would respect Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission's decision to throw out the match and as a result both L.A. Park and La Parka would keep their names. Park stated that for him the Triplemania match was all about pride and not about names and that <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>mattered</b> to him was that he had proven who the true La Parka is, regardless of the names they now go by.|$|E
