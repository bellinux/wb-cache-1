5000|$|The most {{significant}} limitation to {{the detection of}} astronomical emission at submillimetre wavelengths with ground based observatories is <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emission,</b> noise and attenuation. Like the infrared, the submillimetre atmosphere is dominated by numerous water vapour absorption bands {{and it is only}} through [...] "windows" [...] between these bands that observations are possible. The ideal submillimetre observing site is dry, cool, has stable weather conditions and is away from urban population centres. There are only a handful of such sites identified, they include Mauna Kea (Hawaii, United States), the Llano de Chajnantor Observatory on the Atacama Plateau (Chile), the South Pole, and Hanle in India (the Himalayan site of the Indian Astronomical Observatory). Comparisons show that all four sites are excellent for submillimetre astronomy, and of these sites Mauna Kea is the most established and arguably the most accessible. There has been some recent interest in high-altitude Arctic sites, particularly Summit Station in Greenland where the PWV (precipitable water vapor) measure is always better than at Mauna Kea (however Mauna Kea's equatorial latitude of 19 degrees means it can observe more of the southern skies than Greenland).|$|E

The total exergy loss from the most quantitative relevant <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emission</b> substances produced by the life cycle of fuel ethanol is 3. 26 E+ 05 kJ/t of C(2) H(5) OH, Compared with the chemical exergy of 1 t of ethanol (calculated as 34. 56 E + 06 kJ). the exergy loss from the life cycle`s <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emission</b> represents 1. 11 % of the product`s exergy. The activity that most contributes to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emission</b> chemical exergy losses is the harvesting of sugarcane through the methane emitted in burning. Suggestions for improved environmental quality and greater efficiency of the life cycle of fuel ethanol with cogenerated energy are: harvesting the sugarcane without burning, renewable fuels should be used in tractors, trucks and buses instead of fossil fuel and the transportation of products and input should be logistically optimized.

This paper presents spatial surrogates for the disaggregation of CORINAIR <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emission</b> inventories {{for input of}} air pollutants and particulate matter to grid or polygon based air quality model domains inside Europe. The basis for the disaggregation model was the CLC 2000 land cover data to which statistical weights were added. Weights were population census data for residential emissions, employment statistics for agricultural and industrial area emissions, livestock statistics for ammonia emissions and annual aircraft movements for emissions realized by air transport. Additional road and offroad network information was used to disaggregate emissions realized by traffic. A comparison of top down produced emission estimates with spatially resolved national emission data for The Netherlands and the United Kingdom gave confidence in the present spatial surrogates {{as a tool for}} the top down production of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emission</b> maps.

The instrument broad bandpass (87 - 101 GHz) includes strong ozone lines. The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emission</b> profile was measured from 6 to 15 km altitude.

40|$|<b>Atmospheric</b> <b>emission</b> is a {{dominant}} source of disturbance in ground-based astronomy at millimetric wavelengths. The Antarctic plateau {{is recognized as}} an ideal site for millimetric and submillimetric observations, and the French/Italian base of Dome Concordia (Dome C) is among the best sites on Earth for these observations. In this paper, we present measurements at Dome C of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emission</b> in intensity and polarization at a 2 -mm wavelength. This {{is one of the}} best observational frequencies for cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations when considering cosmic signal intensity, atmospheric transmission, detector sensitivity and foreground removal. Using the B-mode radiation interferometer (BRAIN) -pathfinder experiment, we have performed measurements of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emission</b> at 150 GHz. Careful characterization of the airmass synchronous emission has been performed, acquiring more than 380 elevation scans (i. e. ‘skydip’) during the third BRAIN-pathfinder summer campaign in 2009 December/ 2010 January. The extremely high transparency of the Antarctic atmosphere over Dome C is proven by the very low measured optical depth, 〈τI〉= 0. 050 ± 0. 003 ± 0. 011, where the first error is statistical and the second is the systematic error. Mid-term stability, over the summer campaign, of the atmosphere emission has also been studied. Adapting the radiative transfer atmosphere emission model am to the particular conditions found at Dome C, we also infer the level of the precipitable water vapor (PWV) content of the atmosphere, which is notoriously the main source of disturbance in millimetric astronomy (PWV) = 0. 77 ± 0. 15 / 0. 12 mm. Upper limits on the airmass correlated polarized signal are also placed for the first time. The degree of circular polarization of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emission</b> is found to be lower than 0. 2 per cent [95 per cent confidence level (CL) ], while the degree of linear polarization is found to be lower than 0. 1 per cent (95 per cent CL).

In this study we used bird (Parus major and Ficedula hypoleuca) excrement to monitor metal pollution in the terrestrial environment following 16 years of continuously reduced emissions from a copper/nickel smelter in Finland. In the early 1990 s, lead and cadmium concentrations dropped significantly in excrement, but the reduction did not directly reflect the changes in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emission</b> from the smelter. This is likely due to a continuous contribution of metals also from the soil pool.
