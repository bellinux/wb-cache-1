5|$|A {{monument}} to Civil War Union General John Sedgwick {{stands on the}} outskirts of the Plain. Sedgwick's bronze statue has spurs with rowels that freely rotate. Legend states that if a cadet is in danger of failing a class, they are to don their full-dress parade uniform the night before the final exam. The cadet visits the statue <b>and</b> <b>spins</b> the rowels at the stroke of midnight. Then the cadet runs back to the barracks as fast as he or she can. According to legend, if Sedgwick's ghost catches them, they will fail the exam. Otherwise the cadet will pass the exam and the course. Although being out of their rooms after midnight is officially against regulations, violations have been known to be overlooked for the sake of tradition.|$|E
5|$|Gran Trak 10 is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari through its subsidiary Cyan Engineering, and released by Atari in May 1974. In the game, a single player drives a car along a race track, viewed from above, avoiding walls of pylons {{and trying to}} pass as many checkpoints as possible before time runs out. The game is controlled with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and a gear stick, and the car crashes <b>and</b> <b>spins</b> if it hits a pylon. Gran Trak 10 began development in fall of 1973; it was initially designed by Larry Emmons of Cyan, with the mechanical design handled by Eigen Systems, though after several design and production problems were uncovered during an initial small production run in March 1974 the design was overhauled by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, with wider distribution beginning in May. The game's circuits include possibly the first instance of integrated circuit-based read-only memory, rather than graphics storied in diodes, which thereafter became the standard for arcade games.|$|E
5|$|The katipo {{typically}} catches wandering ground invertebrates such as beetles (e.g. Cecyropa modesta) or amphipods (e.g. Bellorchestia quoyana), {{but it may}} occasionally catch moths, flies, {{and other}} spiders. Katipo can catch insects much larger than themselves. These larger insects often become entangled in the web and in the ensuing struggle, the web's ground anchor line breaks. Due to the silk's elasticity, this causes the prey to become suspended a few centimetres off the ground. The katipo then moves to the prey, turns so that the spinnerets are facing the insect <b>and</b> <b>spins</b> silk over it. Like most theridiids, the tarsi of the hind legs have a row of strong curved bristles which are arranged as a comb. The katipo uses these to scoop sticky silk from her spinnerets and throws it over the insect {{with a series of}} rapid movements. After the insect is firmly immobilised, she bites it several times, usually at the joints, before spinning more silk to strengthen the web, and then administering a last long bite which ultimately kills the insect. The spider then moves the prey up into the web until it is ready to eat. If food is readily available then it is common to see five or six insects hanging in the web waiting to be ingested. The male's hunting behaviour is similar to the female's, although may not be as vigorous due to its smaller size.|$|E

5|$|The redback {{is mainly}} nocturnal; the female remains {{concealed}} during the day, <b>and</b> <b>spins</b> her web during the night, usually {{remaining in the}} same location {{for most of her}} adult life. Classified as a gum-footed tangle web, the web is an irregular-looking tangle of fine but strong silk. Although the threads seem random, they are strategically placed for support and entrapment of prey. The rear portion of the web forms a funnel-like retreat area where the spider and egg sacs are found. This area has vertical, sticky catching threads that run to ground attachments. The vertical strands act as trip wires to initially alert the spider to the presence of prey or threats. They also snare and haul prey into the air when weaker horizontal strands that hold them down, known as guy lines, break when prey thrash around. These webs are usually placed between two flat surfaces, one beneath the other. The female spends more time in the funnel and less time moving around during cooler weather.|$|E

40|$|We study <b>spin</b> <b>and</b> valley {{transports}} in junctions {{composed of}} silicene and topological crystalline insulators. We consider normal/magnetic/normal Dirac metal junctions where a gate electrode {{is attached to}} the magnetic region. In normal/antiferromagnetic/normal silicene junction, we show that the current through this junction is valley <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> polarized due to the coupling between valley <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> degrees of freedom, and the valley <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> polarizations can be tuned by local application of a gate voltage. In particular, we find a fully valley <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> polarized current by applying the electric field. In normal/ferromagnetic/normal topological crystalline insulator junction with a strain induced in the ferromagnetic segment, we investigate valley resolved conductances and clarify how the valley polarization stemming from the strain and exchange field appears in this junction. It is found that changing the direction of the magnetization and the potential in the ferromagnetic region, one can control the dominant valley contribution out of four valley degrees of freedom. We also review spin transport in normal/ferromagnetic/normal graphene junctions, <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> <b>and</b> valley transports in normal/ferromagnetic/normal silicene junctions for comparison.

25|$|All of {{the above}} {{correlation}} functions have been defined {{in the context of}} equilibrium statistical mechanics. However, it is possible to define correlation functions for systems away from equilibrium. Examining the general definition of , it is clear that one can define the random variables used in these correlation functions, such as atomic positions <b>and</b> <b>spins,</b> away from equilibrium. As such, their scalar product is well-defined away from equilibrium. The operation which is no longer well-defined away from equilibrium is the average over the equilibrium ensemble. This averaging process for non-equilibrium system is typically replaced by averaging the scalar product across the entire sample. This is typical in scattering experiments and computer simulations, and is often used to measure the radial distribution functions of glasses.|$|E

Many versions had a fixed landing gear, but later versions could have retractable gear, mounted in a widened wing center section (which could have either integral fuel tanks or not). Most had a straight trailing edge on the outer wing while again, some had the wing trailing edge swept forward slightly in an attempt to fix a problem with stalls <b>and</b> <b>spins.</b> Several different rudders were used, with early examples having a round outline, intermediate examples having a square bottom on the rudder (Harvard I) and late examples using the triangular rudder of the AT-6 series, due to a loss of control at high angles of attack with the early types.

500|$|By the mid-1980s, Cedar Point {{had grown}} into a {{successful}} collection of roller coasters and other smaller rides {{on the shores of}} Lake Erie. Dick Kinzel took over as president and CEO of Cedar Fair, the company that operates the park, in 1986. In 1988, Kinzel saw a report on CNN about the opening of a new coaster in Japan called Bandit at Yomiuriland that emphasized height and speed but had no inversions. Kinzel wanted to introduce a similar coaster that emphasized steep drops and negative g-forces over inversions <b>and</b> <b>spins,</b> which were common at the time. It had been 10 years since the last major addition, Gemini, was introduced. Cedar Point asked for proposals from TOGO, Dinn Corporation, Intamin and Arrow Dynamics to build a roller coaster without inversions or over-the-shoulder restraints. They chose Arrow, which proposed a -tall coaster. That got Cedar Point's management interested in breaking the [...] barrier, partly because of the publicity to be gained from building the first roller coaster to do so.

40|$|The {{transport}} of charge <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> at finite energies is studied for the Hubbard chain in {{a magnetic field}} {{by means of the}} pseudoparticle perturbation theory.

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of {{building}} optimally coordinated bidding strategies for competitive suppliers in day-ahead energy <b>and</b> <b>spinning</b> reserve markets is addressed. It is assumed that each supplier bids 24 linear energy supply functions <b>and</b> 24 linear <b>spinning</b> reserve supply functions, one for each hour, into the energy <b>and</b> <b>spinning</b> reserve markets, respectively, and each market is cleared separately and simultaneously for all the 24 delivery hours.

Two different bidding schemes have been suggested for each hour, and based on them an overall coordinated bidding strategy in the day-ahead energy <b>and</b> <b>spinning</b> reserve market is then developed. Stochastic optimisation models are first developed to describe these two different bidding schemes and a genetic algorithm (GA) is then used to build the optimally coordinated bidding strategies for each scheme and to develop an overall bidding strategy for the day-ahead energy <b>and</b> <b>spinning</b> reserve markets.
