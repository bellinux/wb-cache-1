25|$|While {{many people}} burned to death, many others {{died as a}} result of the ensuing chaos. Though most spectators were able to escape the fire, many people were caught up in the hysteria. Witnesses said some simply ran <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>circles</b> trying to find their loved ones, rather than trying to escape from the burning tent. Some escaped but ran back inside to look for family members. Others stayed in their seats until it was too late, {{assuming}} that the fire would be put out promptly.|$|E
25|$|Rex {{was very}} often {{the star of}} these films, {{bringing}} comedy and action to the screen. In one scene from No Man's Law, Rex saves the modesty {{of a young woman}} swimming in the nude from a pair of rowdy villains. Chasing one <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>circles,</b> rearing and bucking like a wild mustang, until he finally runs him off of a cliff, he sneaks up behind the other and nudges him with his nose over the ledge and into the watering hole. He then nose prods the now clothed young woman back to her father.|$|E

25|$|First, how {{to ensure}} that the game comes to an end. Players must be able to settle {{unsettled}} situations rather than going <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>circles.</b> And neither player should be able to drag the game out indefinitely either to avoid losing or to irritate the other player. Possible methods include: the super-ko rule, time control, or placing an upper bound on the number of moves. This is also affected by the scoring method used since territory scoring penalizes extended play after the boundaries of the territories have been settled.|$|E
25|$|Urmuz became head of {{his family}} in 1907. That year, his father and two younger {{brothers}} died, and his sister Eliza was married. He also continued {{to take the initiative}} in daring acts of épater le bourgeois. Ciprian recalls the two of them renting a carriage which Urmuz would order around, making a right at every junction, and effectively going <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>circles</b> around the Palace of Justice. Urmuz then proceeded to pester the street vendors, stopping over to buy a random assortment of useless items: pretzels, a pile of charcoal, and an old hen which he impaled on his walking cane.|$|E
25|$|The Hispanic cavalry {{was a light}} cavalry {{armed with}} a Falcata and several light javelins. The Cantabri tribes invented a {{military}} tactic to maximize {{the advantages of the}} combination between horse and javelin. In this tactic the horsemen rode <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>circles,</b> toward and away from the enemy, continually hurling javelins. The tactic was usually employed against heavy infantry. The constant movement of the horsemen gave them an advantage against slow infantry and made them hard to target. The maneuver was designed to harass and taunt the enemy forces, disrupting close formations. This was commonly used against enemy infantry, especially the heavily armed and slow moving legions of the Romans. This tactic {{came to be known as}} the Cantabrian circle. In the late Republic various auxiliary cavalry completely replaced the Italian cavalry contingents and the Hispanic auxiliary cavalry was considered the best.|$|E

500|$|... "Circles" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Christina Aguilera, taken from her seventh studio album, Lotus (2012). It was written by Aguilera, Dwayne Abernathy, Candice Pillay and co-written and produced by Alex da Kid. Musically, the song is an uptempo alternative rock track. Lyrically, it finds Aguilera inviting her haters to [...] "spin <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>circles</b> on her middle finger". The track received favorable reviews from music critics, who praised its raunchy lyrics and its catchiness. Upon the release of Lotus, [...] "Circles" [...] debuted on the South Korean international singles chart at number 160.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} for its deep single-player missions and varied enemy types. Game Revolution highlighted {{the long and}} complex levels, but admitted that players may [...] "" [...] <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>circles</b> for hours {{trying to figure out}} where to go next. This may be enjoyable for people who like puzzles and long gameplay, but it is aggravating for more action-oriented players." [...] N64 Magazine gave high marks to the game's level design and explained that the addition of mission objectives [...] "gives the game more focus and betters its predecessor's pretty limited and fairly simple key-collection." [...] The artificial intelligence of enemies was considered more advanced than GoldenEye 007s, as enemies can take refuge behind objects and pop up to throw explosives towards the player. GamePro also noted that they were more aggressive than Dinosaur Hunters. The game's large arsenal of weapons was also praised, with GameSpot remarking that the Cerebral Bore is [...] "possibly the grossest weapon ever conceived". The multiplayer mode was praised for its use of 3D space and innovative game types.|$|E
500|$|In {{making the}} album Parablepsia, Kawada {{describes}} {{the concept of}} the album as [...] "E.M.R.", which stands for [...] "Electric. Mami Kawada. Rock". She considers [...] "Borderland" [...] to be most representative of her style, so she wanted to make an album which included songs which sounded similar to it. Originally, she only wanted a single song to convey the theme of the album, but for Parablepsia, several songs do. This includes the title song [...] "Parablepsia", which she describes as a song about not losing yourself in a society which moves <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>circles,</b> [...] "Fly Blind", which is a song about not always allowing yourself to be influenced by society, [...] "Eager Eyes", which is the song in the album which has the closest style to [...] "Borderland", [...] "It's no big deal", which takes inspiration from a phrase that her father used to say to her, and [...] "Dendritic Quartz", which is about flowers which constantly bloom and will never wither; [...] "Dendritic Quartz" [...] takes inspiration from a pendant she owns which has a pattern of trees.|$|E

500|$|The {{process of}} hunting the Monster was praised. Ingenito {{thought that the}} hunting process was as tense as the actual {{confrontation}} and combat between the Hunters and the Monster. The four classes was also applauded by him, as he considered that the distant class abilities have successfully made players co-operate {{with each other in}} order to achieve success, as well as making the decision of choosing the correct character important and tactical. This was also contradicted by Strom, who felt that the hunter gameplay up until finding the monster was [...] "hollow", and generally just consisted of going <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>circles.</b> Marchiafava thought that Evolve had successfully delivered a compelling experience while playing with other players. He was also surprised by the game's balance between the Monster and the Hunters. Meikleham thought that playing the game with other players can be an exhilarating experience, but only when players communicate with each other using microphones. Rowan thought that Evolve could only deliver an enjoyable experience when all players play cooperatively, and the overall experience would crumble if one of these players failed to do so. Lathi liked Evolves resources management, singling out the need for the Hunters to manage and conserve the energy for their jetpacks.|$|E
500|$|Recorded at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California by Josh Mosser, [...] "Circles" [...] {{was written}} by Christina Aguilera, Candice Pillay, Alexander Grant and Dwayne Abernathy, and it was {{produced}} by Alex da Kid. Aguilera's vocals were recorded by Oscar Ramirez at The Red Lips Room in Beverly Hills, California, while Aguilera and Pillay conducted the vocal production. Pillay also contributed additional vocals on the track, and J Browz added additional guitar. [...] "Circles" [...] is an alternative rock song, and runs for a duration of [...] (three minutes and twenty-five seconds). The lyrics of the [...] "rawky" [...] chorus, [...] "spin <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>circles</b> on my middle middle finger", has been likened to a [...] "'90s riot-grrrl". Andrew Hampp for Billboard thought as though it sounded like [...] "mini-Aguilera's" [...] were chanting the words [...] "round and round" [...] and [...] "motherfucker" [...] in childlike voices. [...] "Circles" [...] has a [...] "playground" [...] melodic structure, according to Robert Copsey of Digital Spy. He also thought the best lyrics in the song are [...] "Why you always {{trying to get up}} in my mixture?/ I think you're just bitter". At the end of the song, Aguilera speaks out loud the word [...] "motherfucker!".|$|E
500|$|Trott's {{sense of}} humour was well known. [...] He {{originated}} a persistent myth that {{workers at the}} Sheffield steelworks generated extra plumes of smoke when the Australians were batting at nearby Bramall Lane, {{in order to reduce}} the quality of the light. [...] When Australia played the Gentlemen of Philadelphia in the United States, a local reporter asked Trott why Australians did not play baseball. He replied: [...] "Running <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>circles</b> makes us giddy." [...] When Trott, a humble postman, met the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) in 1896, his teammates admired his natural ease of manner in the presence of royalty. [...] Given a cigar by the Prince, Trott simply smoked it, to the surprise of those who thought a royal souvenir worth keeping. [...] With this in mind, Trott later played a practical joke when he returned home. Gathering cigar butts on board the ship before disembarking in Australia, he distributed them to his friends claiming it was the one given to him by the Prince of Wales; he asked the recipients not to tell others in case it provoked jealousy. [...] Trott was extremely fond of hats; a teammate described him as [...] "...the only man I have seen who, in the nude, had to have a hat on his head".|$|E

2500|$|This stunt {{was adapted}} from Jay Milligan's Astro Spiral Javelin show cars. These were jumps {{performed}} in AMC sponsored thrill shows at fairs around the US, including the Houston Astrodome, where Gremlins and Hornets were also used to drive <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>circles</b> on their side two wheels in the arena. [...] Using exactly the same ramp design, movie artists made the ramps convincingly look like a rickety old bridge that was falling apart. [...] The movie's director ruined the continuous spiral effect of the stunt. [...] By cutting camera shots as the car was in mid-air, it looks like trick photography to get the car upside-down instead of one continuous actual jump.|$|E
