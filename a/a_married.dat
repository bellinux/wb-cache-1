5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, women had a very limited legal status. <b>A</b> <b>married</b> woman had few property rights and could not make a will without her husband's permission, although jurists expected this to be given. Men had considerable latitude in disciplining the women under their authority and although a handful of cases turn up in higher courts, and the kirk session did intervene to protect women from domestic abuse, it was usually only when the abuse began to disturb public order. The criminal courts refused to recognise women as witnesses, or as independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. As a result, <b>a</b> <b>married</b> woman could not sell property, sue in court or make contracts without her husband's permission.|$|E
