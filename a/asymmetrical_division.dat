50|$|<b>Asymmetrical</b> <b>division</b> {{goes on for}} {{approximately}} three months during human development 2. An estimate of how many neurons the human brain possesses comes out to be about 100 billion neurons, so that means {{on any given day}} during this three-month period of <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>division,</b> there are around one billion neurons traveling along these radial glia fibers throughout the cerebral cortex 2. For the first layer of the cerebral cortex, the migration of the neurons along the radial glia is extremely short and takes around a single day. For the neurons that reside in the sixth, or outermost layer, their migration takes almost two weeks. Cortical development ends when programmed cell death (apoptosis) is triggered in progenitor cells via activation of “killer genes”.|$|E
50|$|During embryogenesis, the {{epidermis}} splits {{into two}} layers: the periderm (which is lost) and the basal layer. The basal layer is a stem cell layer and through <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>divisions,</b> becomes {{the source of}} skin cells throughout life. It is maintained as a stem cell layer through an autocrine signal, TGF-a, and through paracrine signal FGF7 aka keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) produced by the dermis below the basal cells. In mice, over-expression of these factors leads to an overproduction of granule cells and thick skin.|$|R
50|$|Rakic (2011) {{posed the}} theory on how an {{extremely}} large brain {{of a human}} could arise. He proposed that the division of progenitor cells during symmetrical division increased the ventricular zone of the brain 3. A delay in the termination of symmetrical and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>divisions</b> {{could result in the}} larger size of the human brain when compared to other species 2. This delay could be caused by mutations of the gene controlling the timing of brain development 2. Also, the convoluted appearance of the brain (sulci and gyri) increase the surface area of the cerebral cortex, which allows for more complex circuitry of interconnected neurons within the brain 2.|$|R

A simple, unreflective cognizance of pregiven religious fundamentals, in the manner advocated by the Salafi-minded Ibn Taymīyyah, was still knowledge; yet nothing could disentangle it from the mundane influences that normally impinge upon the human faculty of comprehension.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} birth times of neurons of labellar taste sensilla in blowflies using {{incorporation}} of the thymidine analogue 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) {{as an indicator of}} birth time. We found that one of the two main sensil-lum types, the taste papillae, arise according to a clear spatial gradient of birth times, whereas the other sensil-lum type, taste hairs, arise without any apparent spatial ordering. Within each sensillum type, there was a strong tendency for either all or none of the neurons to have incorporated BrdU. Among those rare sensilla in which only some of the neurons incorporated BrdU, there were clear patterns of the distribution of labeled and unlabeled neurons per sensillurn. These results suggest that sub-sets of the neurons of a sensillum are siblings, and thus argue against the possibility that the several neurons of a sensillum arise from a single stem cell precursor through repeated <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>divisions.</b> 0 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R
50|$|In plants, suspensors {{are found}} in zygotes in angiosperms, {{connecting}} the endosperm to an embryo. Usually in dicots the suspensor cells divide transversally {{a few times to}} form a filamentous suspensor of 6-10 cells. The suspensor helps in pushing the embryo into the endosperm. The first cell of the suspensor towards the micropylar end becomes swollen and functions as a haustorium. The haustorium has wall ingrowths similar to those of a transfer cell. The last of the suspensors {{at the end of the}} embryo is known as hypophysis. Hypophysis later gives rise to the radicle and root cap. During embryo development in angiosperm seeds, normal development involves <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>division</b> of the unicellular embryo, inducing polarity. The smaller terminal cell divides to become the proembryo while the larger basal cell divides laterally to form the suspensor. The suspensor is analogous to a placental mammalian's umbilical cord.|$|E
50|$|Progenitor cells inhabit an area {{outside of}} the early neural tube called the {{ventricular}} zone. Progenitor cells divide during a phase called symmetrical division. These new cells can then move to an area termed the subventricular zone, where they continue to divide. After a period of approximately seven weeks or so for human development, the progenitor cells trigger {{a new form of}} division called asymmetrical cell division 2. Like the name suggests, this division results in not only a duplicate progenitor cell, but also a neuronal precursor cell 2. Radial glia, which play an integral role in the migration of neuronal precursor cells during cerebral cortex development, are the first brain cells to be produced through <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>division</b> 2. The cell bodies of radial glia stay in close proximity to the wall of the neural tube within the ventricular and subventricular zones, but they extend processes outward and connect to the pia mater, the innermost layer of the meninges (a group of protective tissues that surround the brain). As the cerebral cortex becomes thicker, the fibers of radial glia extend and preserve their connections with the pia mater 2. The job of these radial glia are to provide guidance for neurons migrating throughout the developing brain.|$|E
40|$|The apical {{region of}} the Drosophila testis {{contains}} a niche with two stem cell populations: germline stem cells (GSCs) and cyst progenitor cells (CPCs). <b>Asymmetrical</b> <b>division</b> of these stem cells leads to gonioblast daughters (which undergo further mitoses) and cyst cell daughters (which withdraw from the cell cycle and become quiescent). Although a considerable body of evidence indicates important roles for centrosomes in spindle orientation and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>division</b> of GSCs, the behaviour and function of the centrioles in CPCs and their daughters remain unknown. Here, we show that quiescent cyst cells lose centrosome components after two divisions of the spermatogonia they envelop, but keep the centriolar component SAS- 6. Cyst cells do have centriole pairs, but they are formed by {{a mother and a}} very short daughter that does not elongate or mature. The presence of procentrioles in quiescent cyst cells suggests that the centriole duplication cycle is uncoupled from the G 1 -S transition and that it might begin even earlier, in mitosis. Failure to enter the cell cycle might result in the improper recruitment of centriolar components at the mother centriole, thus hampering the full elongation of its daughter. Procentriole maturation defects could thus lead to the inability to maintain centrosomal components during development...|$|E
40|$|The cancer {{stem cell}} (CSC) theory is {{currently}} a very important fi eld in cancer research.

CSCs are metastatic and chemoresistant, two features that very likely contribute to the poor response of locally advanced lung cancer.

A correlation has been found in terms of chemoresistance and bad prognosis in patient-derived samples enriched with CSCs, indicating that these cells are an important target for future therapy combinations.

40|$|Investigating the {{mechanisms}} controlling the asymmetric division of neocortical progenitors that generate neurones in the mammalian brain {{is crucial for}} understanding the abnormalities of cortical development. Partitioning of fate determinants is a key instructive step and components of the apical junctional complex (adherens junctions), including the polarity proteins PAR 3 and aPKC as well as adhesion molecules such as N-cadherin, have been proposed to be candidate determinants. In this study, however, we found no correlation between the partitioning of N-cadherin and fate determination. Rather, we show that adherens junctions comprise three membrane domains, and that during <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>division</b> these are split such that both daughters retain the adhesive proteins that control cell position, but only one daughter inherits the polarity proteins along with the apical membrane. This provides a molecular explanation as to how both daughters remain anchored to the ventricular surface after mitosis, while adopting different fates...|$|E
40|$|The {{causes of}} {{biological}} gigantism have received much attention, {{but only for}} individual organisms. What selection pressures might favour the evolution of gigantic societies? Here we consider the largest single-queen insect societies, those of the Old World army ant Dorylus, single colonies of which can have 20 million workers. We propose that colony gigantism in Dorylus arises {{as a result of}} an arms race and test this prediction by developing a size-structured mathematical model. We use this model for exploring and potentially explaining differences in colony size, colony aggression and colony propagation strategies in populations of New World army ants Eciton and Old World army ants Dorylus. The model shows that, by determining evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs), differences in the trophic levels at which these army ants live feed forwards into differences in their densities and collision rates and, hence, into different strategies of growth, aggression and propagation. The model predicts large colony size and the occurrence of battles and a colony-propagation strategy involving highly <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>divisions</b> in Dorylus and that Eciton colonies should be smaller, non-combative and exhibit equitable binary fission. These ESSs are in excellent agreement with field observations and demonstrate that gargantuan societies can arise through arms races...|$|R

40|$|Although a {{large number}} of embryo mutants have been studied, mostly at the {{morphological}} level, the critical molecular and cellular events responsible for embryogenesis are unknown.

We traced the earliest point of influence of RSH to the first <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>division</b> of the zygote. Homozygous rsh embryos were defective morphologically, had irregular cell shape and size, and germinated to form agravitropic-defective seedlings incapable of further development. The RSH gene encodes a Hyp-rich glycoprotein–type cell wall protein. RSH localized to the cell wall throughout the embryo and to a few well-defined postembryonic sites.

40|$|Are {{resources}} in visual working memory allocated {{in a continuous}} or a discrete fashion? On one hand, flexible resource models suggest that capacity is determined by a central resource pool that can be flexibly divided such that items of greater complexity receive {{a larger share of}} resources. On the other hand, if capacity in working memory is defined in terms of discrete storage “slots, ” then observers may be able to determine which items are assigned to a slot but not how resources are divided between stored items. To test these predictions, the authors manipulated the relative complexity of the items to be stored while holding the number items constant. Although mnemonic resolution declined when set size increased (Experiment 1), resolution for a given item was unaffected by large variations in the complexity of the other items to be stored when set size was held constant (Experiments 2 – 4). Thus, {{resources in}} visual working memory are distributed in a discrete slot-based fashion, even when interitem variations in complexity motivate an <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>division</b> of resources across items...|$|E

40|$|Mammalian oocytes undergo an <b>asymmetrical</b> first meiotic <b>division,</b> {{extruding}} half {{of their}} chromosomes in a small polar body to preserve maternal resources for embryonic development. To divide asymmetrically, mammalian oocytes relocate chromosomes {{from the center of}} the cell to the cortex, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Here, we show that upon the elevation of intracellular cAMP level, mouse oocytes produced two daughter cells with similar sizes. This symmetrical cell division could be rescued by the inhibition of PKA, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Live cell imaging revealed that a symmetrically localized cleavage furrow resulted in symmetrical cell division. Detailed analyses demonstrated that symmetrically localized cleavage furrows were caused by the inappropriate central positioning of chromosome clusters at anaphase onset, indicating that chromosome cluster migration was impaired. Notably, high intracellular cAMP reduced myosin II activity, and the microinjection of phospho-myosin II antibody into the oocytes impeded chromosome migration and promoted symmetrical cell division. Our results support the hypothesis that cAMP plays a role in regulating <b>asymmetrical</b> cell <b>division</b> by modulating myosin II activity during mouse oocyte meiosis I, providing a novel insight into the regulation of female gamete formation in mammals...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{hypothesis}} {{of the presence of}} tumor-initiating cancer stem cells (CSCs) has received a considerable support. This model suggested the existence of CSCs which, thanks to their self-renewal properties, are able to drive the expansion and the maintenance of malignant cell populations with invasive and metastatic potential in cancer. Increasing evidence showed the ability of such cells to acquire self-renewal, multipotency, angiogenic potential, immune evasion, symmetrical and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>divisions</b> which, along with the presence of several DNA repair mechanisms, further enhance their oncogenic potential making them highly resistant to common anticancer treatments. The main signaling pathways involved in the homeostasis of colorectal (CRC) stem cells are the Wnt, Notch, Sonic Hedgehog, and Bone Morfogenic Protein (BMP) pathways, which are mostly responsible for all the features that have been widely referred to stem cells. The same pathways have been identifi ed in colorectal cancer stem cells (CRCSCs), conferring a more aggressive phenotype compared to non-stem CRC cells. Recently, several evidences suggested that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) may {{play a crucial role in}} the regulation of different biological mechanisms in CRC, by modulating the expression of critical stem cell transcription factors that have been found active in CSCs. In this chapter, we will discuss the involvement of ncRNAs, especially microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), in stemness acquisition and maintenance by CRCSCs, through the regulation of pathways modulating the CSC phenotype and growth, carcinogenesis, differentiation, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) ...|$|R
40|$|Caffeine {{treatment}} of growing wheat tissues {{was used to}} form binucleate or polyploid cells; preprophase microtubules in subsequent division cycles in these and some other abnormal cells were then examined. In root tips, binucleate cells or those with greatly enlarged nuclei usually contained one transverse preprophase band of microtubules; sometimes this was slightly asymmetrical or skew, and less commonly two bands were seen. In coleoptile vascular bundles, there were generally two or more bands in the greatly elongated cells, these sometimes appearing in different planes. During formation of the stomatal complexes, preprophase microtubules were almost invariably found where expected, preceding abnormal development both in untreated and also in caffeine-treated material, regardless of the number, disposition or size of nuclei. This occurred even when wall stumps, formed during a previous abortive division, indicated that that previous division was also asymmetrical. It is concluded that the position(s) of preprophase band(s) of microtubules is not particularly influenced by the nucleus or nuclei, being more susceptible to external morphogenetic influences which can persist for some considerable time.

Indeed an over-expression of p 53 in tumor cells induces <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>division</b> avoiding self-renewal of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and instead promoting their differentiation. In this study, 28 human breast carcinomas have been analyzed for expression of wild-type p 53 and of a pool of non-clustered homeobox genes.

40|$|The {{protozoan}} Giardia lamblia is {{the most}} frequent intestinal parasite of first-world countries and {{a major cause of}} waterborne disorder often referred to as traveler’s diarrhea. We have previously noticed that the putrescine analog 1, 4 -diamino- 2 -butanone (DAB) remarkably inhibits the growth of anaerobic trichomonad and Trypanosoma cruzi parasites. Here, we examined the role of polyamines in Giardia cells using this putrescine analog. DAB impaired parasite proliferation dose-dependently. The analog induced increased flagella numbers and sometimes four ventral disks as well as <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>division,</b> indicating truncated or deregulated cytokinesis. Electron microscopy analysis revealed that DAB also triggered the encystment process. Oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring lipid peroxidation by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) detection. Trophozoites incubated either with 1 mM of DAB or putrescine for 18 h displayed increased lipoperoxide levels. Addition of 200 μM aminoguanidine, a polyamine/diamine oxidase inhibitor, partially reverted the DAB, but not the putrescine effects, indicating that the DAB effects are due, at least in part, to DAB oxidation end products. These data indicate that polyamines play a role in Giardia cell division, differentiation, and antioxidant defense...|$|E

40|$|In frogs, {{there are}} clearly visible {{differently}} pigmented animal and vegetal poles {{of the egg}} determined before fertilization and leading to <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>divisions.</b> Mammalian egg does not show any comparable differentiation {{and it has been}} generally accepted that even the individual blastomeres in 2 -cell and 4 -cell embryos are homogenous. However, recent findings suggest that those blastomeres display different gene expression patterns and might already possess some inclinations to specific cell lineages. We therefore raised a question, whether there could be any mRNA or protein gradients in pre-fertilization oocytes similar to a previously described amphibian egg one. In mammalian eggs, there is a membrane region that is poor in microvilli, cortical granules are absent beneath plasma membrane and sperm cells generally do not bind to this location. This microvilli free region also covers the egg nucleus, and cytoskeleton localization differs markedly {{to the rest of the}} cortical space, forming actin –myosin II cortical cap/ring and is considered as animal pole. The purpose of this study was to determine gene products that can be detected at single cell level using qPCR and display gradient like distribution in mature oocytes. We checked expression of 12 selected genes in a pool of 10 oocytes and single mature oocytes. Then, we analysed gene expression in fixed intact oocytes and those undergoing laser capture microdissection procedure (LCMD).
