5|$|A {{photograph}} of Schlosshotel Kronberg (then called Schloss Friedrichshof after its owner Kaiserin Friedrich) became famous {{due to its}} accidental inclusion of the photographer's wing tips.

5|$|A {{series of}} legal {{disputes}} between Reynolds and General Motors (GM) began in 2007. Through a GM program called the Integrated Dealership Management System (GMIDMS), Reynolds provided software to GM dealerships through GM. When Reynolds {{would not make}} changes to its software requested by GM, GM alleged it was <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> of contract. A settlement was reached in 2008, which ended Reynolds' participation in GM's program.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{domestic}} workers' {{wages are}} subject to a statutory minimum, <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> of which is sanctionable under the Employment Ordinance.

50|$|The {{first three}} {{aircraft}} to attack, Gibson (G-George), Hopgood (M-Mother) and Martin (P-Popsie), all missed the target. A-Apple was fourth to attack {{and hit the}} dam, causing <b>a</b> small <b>breach.</b> <b>As</b> this <b>breach</b> was not apparent, a fifth aircraft Maltby (J-Johnny) subsequently attacked the dam and achieved a hit, causing <b>a</b> larger <b>breach.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hence, the sappers {{received}} {{an order to}} open <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> in the walls. General Higonet entered the fortress, held by 250 men who surrendered with sixty cannons and 800,000 rounds of ammunition. The French troops moved in intending to remain for some time, building up Navarino’s fortifications, rebuilding its houses and setting up a hospital and various features of local administration.|$|E
5|$|StarCrafts success also {{inspired}} {{third-party developer}} Microstar Software to release an unauthorized add-on, entitled Stellar Forces, in May 1998. Blizzard Entertainment consequently {{filed a lawsuit}} against Microstar for selling the add-on, arguing that as the product was unauthorized and created using StarCrafts level editing software, it was <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> of the end user license agreement.|$|E
5|$|A {{crime is}} {{committed}} if any person posts or distributes a placard, circular or other document which contains an incitement to violence, counsels disobedience {{to the law}} or a lawful order, or is {{likely to lead to}} <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> of the peace. Spreading false reports or making false statements likely to cause public alarm orally, in writing, or in any newspaper, periodical, book, circular or other printed publication is also an offence.|$|E

5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would not make <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> of containment inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, the ACLU {{continued}} its battle against censorship {{of art and}} literature. In 1948, the New York affiliate of the ACLU received mixed results from the Supreme Court, winning the appeal of Carl Jacob Kunz, who was convicted for speaking without a police permit, but losing the appeal of Irving Feiner who was arrested to prevent <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> of the peace, based on his oration denouncing president Truman and the American Legion. The ACLU lost the case of Joseph Beahharnais, who was arrested for group libel when he distributed literature impugning the character of African Americans.|$|E
5|$|In some species, some {{soldiers}} block tunnels {{to prevent their}} enemies from entering the nest, and they may deliberately rupture themselves {{as an act of}} defence. In cases where the intrusion is coming from <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> that is larger than the soldier's head, defence requires a special formations where soldiers form a phalanx-like formation around the breach and bite at intruders. If an invasion carried out by Megaponera analis is successful, an entire colony may be destroyed, although this scenario is rare.|$|E

The fungus infiltrates the heartwood {{of the tree}} via <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> in its bark, either by a branch falling, damage from insects or mistletoe, or by mechanical damage from logging. O.nidiformis has been implicated in the heartwood rot of several species of eucalypt around Australia, including marri (Corymbia calophylla) in southwest Western Australia, in spotted gum (C.maculata) and messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua) in New South Wales, and in blackbutt (E.pilularis), Sydney blue gum (E.saligna), red stringybark (E.macrorhyncha) and Forth River peppermint (E.radiata) in Victoria.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 2006, a {{judge in}} Cook County, Illinois, {{determined}} that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5million in <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> of contract claim. Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret. Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991. A DNA test showed Jordan was not {{the father of the}} child.|$|E
5|$|Polygamy caused <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> between Smith and {{his first}} wife, Emma. Although Emma knew of some of her husband's marriages, she almost {{certainly}} {{did not know the}} extent of his polygamous activities. In 1843, Emma temporarily accepted Smith's marriage to four women boarded in the Smith household, but soon regretted her decision and demanded the other wives leave. In July 1843, Smith dictated a revelation directing Emma to accept plural marriage, but the two were not reconciled until September 1843, after Emma began participating in temple ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of war, the King and Government began to disagree. While the Government argued that the German invasion had violated Belgian neutrality and made Belgium one of the Allies, Leopold argued that Belgium was still a neutral country and had no obligations beyond defending its borders. Leopold opposed allowing British and French forces into Belgian territory to fight alongside Belgian troops, as <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> of its neutrality.|$|E
5|$|The British {{authorities}} in the area refused to support the raid, which they considered <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> of Spanish neutrality. Permission for the operation to go ahead eventually came from the Foreign Office in London. On 14 January 1942, while the ships' officers were attending a party arranged by an SOE agent, the commandos entered the port aboard two tugs, overpowered the ships' crews and sailed off with the ships, including the Italian merchant vessel Duchessa d'Aosta. The raid boosted SOE's reputation at a critical time and demonstrated its ability to plan and conduct secret operations no matter the political consequences.|$|E
5|$|The European Parliament can {{dissolve}} the Commission {{as a whole}} following a vote of no-confidence but only the President can request the resignation of an individual Commissioner. However, individual Commissioners, by request of the Council or Commission, can be compelled to retire on account of <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> of obligation(s) and if so ruled by the European Court of Justice (Art. 245 and 247, Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).|$|E
50|$|Scoria cones {{are small}} volcanoes with {{relatively}} steep sides, usually formed {{as the result}} of a single major episode of volcanic activity. Lava lakes often form in the centre of scoria cones; if the lava in such <b>a</b> lake <b>breaches</b> the side of the cone, the result is <b>a</b> <b>breached</b> scoria cone, such as Mount Elephant. There are approximately 200 breached scoria cones in Victoria.|$|R
25|$|Clinker Peak, <b>a</b> <b>breached</b> {{volcanic}} crater on {{its western}} flank, was formed {{during a period}} of volcanic activity about 10,000years ago. Oxidation of Price's volcanic rocks has given the mountain a red colour.|$|R

5|$|The {{eruption}} of Thera and volcanic fallout may have inspired the myths of the Titanomachy in Hesiod's Theogony. The Titanomachy could {{have picked up}} elements of western Anatolian folk memory, as the tale spread westward. Hesiod's lines have been compared with volcanic activity, citing Zeus's thunderbolts as volcanic lightning, the boiling earth and sea as <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> of the magma chamber, immense flame and heat as evidence of phreatic explosions, among many other descriptions.|$|E
5|$|Their time in Rome {{was a brief}} two days, {{during which}} Kalākaua, Armstrong, and Judd were granted an {{audience}} with Pope Leo XIII on July 3. After receiving his blessing, they toured St. Peter's Basilica and other local tourist sites, and left the following day by train. The party traveled across France and Paris without informing the French authorities, which was seen as <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> of official protocol {{and had to be}} explained at a later date.|$|E
5|$|Verified status {{does not}} imply that Twitter {{continuously}} checks whether such accounts have been hacked. The account of Tesla Motors, for example, was impersonated briefly in 2015. Some users have tried to impersonate verified accounts without hacking them by placing the checkmark in their background images. Twitter referred to this as <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> of their rules and introduced a design update to make this more difficult. In July 2016, Twitter began allowing anyone to apply for a verified account. The company announced that they will disable the verification progress in response to an outlash after white nationalist Jason Kessler got verified on Twitter.|$|E
