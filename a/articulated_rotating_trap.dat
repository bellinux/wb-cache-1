40|$|Rotating {{properties}} of Bose-Einstein condensates in synthetic magnetic field are studied by numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and compared with condensates confined in the <b>rotating</b> <b>trap.</b> It seems {{that it is}} more difficult to add large angular momentum to condensates spined up by the synthetic magnetic field than by the <b>rotating</b> <b>trap.</b> However, strengthening the repulsive interaction between atoms is an effective and realizable route to overcome this problem and can at least generate vortex-lattice-like structures. In addition, the validity of the Feynman rule for condensates in synthetic magnetic field is verified. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{situations}} in which the collective motion of a superfluid Fermi gas is coupled to quasiparticle excitations. Quasiparticle excitations are, for example, present at finite temperature, but also at zero temperature {{in the case of}} a <b>rotating</b> <b>trap.</b> In this paper, I present a semiclassical description of such systems, where the superfluid component is described by hydrodynamics while the normal component, formed by the quasiparticles, is described by a transport equation similar to the Vlasov equation. The coupling between the two components generates a strong damping of the collective modes. As applications of the semiclassical theory, the case of a <b>rotating</b> <b>trap</b> and several collective modes (quadrupole and scissors modes) of the trapped gas are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} {{generating}} {{a family of}} new solutions starting from any wave function satisfying the nonlinear Schrödinger equation in a harmonic potential proposed recently [J. J. García-Ripoll, V. M. Pérez-García, and V. Vekslerchik, Phys. Rev. E 64, 056602 (2001) ] is extended to many-body theory of mutually interacting particles. Our method {{is based on a}} generalization of the displacement operator known in quantum optics and results in the separation of the center of mass motion from the internal dynamics of many-body systems. The center of mass motion is analyzed for an anisotropic <b>rotating</b> <b>trap</b> and a region of instability for intermediate rotational velocities is predicted.

40|$|Quantum {{tunneling}} {{introduces a}} fundamental difference between classical and quantum mechanics. Whenever the classical ground state is non-unique (degenerate), quantum mechanics restore uniqueness thanks to tunneling. A condensate in a <b>rotating</b> <b>trap</b> with a vortex can have such a degenerate classical ground state, a degeneracy that is excluded {{in the absence of}} rotation at least when the Gross-Pitaevskii equation applies. If the <b>rotating</b> <b>trap</b> has a center of symmetry, like a figure eight (a peanut), the vortex may be on either side with the same energy yielding a degenerate ground state, a degeneracy lifted by quantum tunneling. We explain how to compute the rate of tunneling in the WKB limit by estimating the action of the trajectory in the Euclidean version of the dynamics. Comment: 4 p, 4 Fig...|$|R
40|$|Based on an {{analytic}} {{solution of}} the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the large-condensate (Thomas-Fermi) limit we determine {{the structure of a}} stationary vortex in a Bose-Einstein condensate in a nonaxisymmetric <b>rotating</b> <b>trap.</b> The condensate velocity field has cylindrical symmetry only near the vortex core and becomes intrinsically anisotropic near the condensate boundaries. <b>Rotating</b> the anisotropic <b>trap</b> induces an additional irrotational velocity field even for a vortex-free condensate.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the thermodynamic stability of quantized vortices in a dilute Bose gas confined by a <b>rotating</b> harmonic <b>trap</b> at finite temperature. Interatomic forces {{play a crucial}} role in characterizing the resulting phase diagram, especially in the large $N$ Thomas-Fermi regime. We show that the critical temperature for the creation of stable vortices exhibits a maximum as a function of the frequency of the <b>rotating</b> <b>trap</b> and that the corresponding transition is associated with a discontinuity in the number of atoms in the condensate. Possible strategies for approaching the vortical region are discussed. Comment: Revtex, 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{possible}} {{applications to}} cold atomic gases in a <b>rotating</b> <b>trap,</b> we give {{an overview of}} some important concepts in two-dimensional vortex physics. In the context of Josephson junction arrays, we first discuss the crucial role payed by vortices in both the thermal superconducting to normal metal transition, and the zero temperature superconducting to Mott insulator transition. Important notions on vortex dynamics in these arrays are then presented, with emphasis on experimental results indicating the quantum nature of vortex motion at low temperature. We move then to the Fractional Quantum Hall effect, as observed in electronic systems, and introduce the notions of fractional excitations, generalized statistics, and composite Fermions, which have {{played a key role}} in the theoretical description of this remarkable phenomenon. Very likely, cold atomic gases in a <b>rotating</b> <b>trap</b> will soon provide a way to explore the bosonic version of the Fractional Quantum Hall effect, and thus shedding new light on these subtle strongly correlated quantum fluids...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of a Fermi gas confined in a deformed <b>trap</b> <b>rotating</b> at low angular velocity is investigated {{in the framework of}} hydrodynamic theory. The differences exhibited by a normal gas in the collisional regime and a superfluid are discussed. Special emphasis is given to the collective oscillations excited when the deformation of the <b>rotating</b> <b>trap</b> is suddenly removed or when the rotation is suddenly stopped. The presence of vorticity in the normal phase is shown to give rise to precession and beating phenomena which are absent in the superfluid phase. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{observed}} {{the expansion of}} vortex-free Bose-condensates after their sudden release from a slowly <b>rotating</b> anisotropic <b>trap.</b> Our results show clear experimental evidence of the irrotational flow expected for a superfluid. The expansion from a <b>rotating</b> <b>trap</b> has strong features associated with the superfluid nature of a Bose-condensate, namely that the condensate cannot at any point be cylindrically symmetric {{with respect to the}} axis of rotation since such a wavefunction cannot possess angular momentum. Consequently, an initially rotating condensate expands in a distinctively different way to one released from a static trap. We report measurements of this phenomenon in absorption images of the condensate taken along the direction of the rotation axis. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the vortex {{structure of a}} rapidly <b>rotating</b> <b>trapped</b> atomic Bose-Einstein condensate {{in the presence of}} a co-rotating periodic optical lattice potential. We observe a rich variety of structural phases which reflect the interplay of the vortex-vortex and vortex-lattice interactions. The lattice structure is very sensitive to the ratio of vortices to pinning sites and we observe structural phase transitions and domain formation as this ratio is varied.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{rotational}} properties of a Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a <b>rotating</b> harmonic <b>trap</b> for different trap anisotropies. Using simple arguments, we derive expressions for the velocity {{field of the}} quantum fluid for condensates with or without vortices. While the condensed gas describes open spiraling trajectories, on the frame of reference of the <b>rotating</b> <b>trap</b> {{the motion of the}} fluid is against the trap rotation. We also find explicit formulae for the angular momentum and a linear and Thomas-Fermi solutions for the state without vortices. In these two limits we also find an analytic relation between the shape of the cloud and the rotation speed. The predictions are supported by numerical simulations of the mean field Gross-Pitaevskii model. Comment: 4 RevTeX pages, 2 EPS figures; typos fixed, reference adde...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the groundstates of weakly interacting bosons in a <b>rotating</b> <b>trap</b> {{as a function}} of the number of bosons, N, and the average number of vortices, N_V. We identify the filling fraction ν≡ N/N_V as the parameter controlling the nature of these states. We present results indicating that, {{as a function of}} ν, there is a zero temperature phase transition between a triangular vortex lattice phase, and strongly-correlated vortex liquid phases. The vortex liquid phases appear to be the Read-Rezayi parafermion states...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the Cauchy problem for (energy-subcritical) nonlinear Schrödinger equations with sub-quadratic external potentials {{and an additional}} angular momentum rotation term. This equation is a well-known model for superfluid quantum gases in <b>rotating</b> <b>traps.</b> We prove global existence (in the energy space) for defocusing nonlinearities without any restriction on the rotation frequency, generalizing earlier results given in [11, 12]. Moreover, {{we find that the}} rotation term has a considerable influence in proving finite time blow-up in the focusing case. Comment: 13 page...|$|R

We obtain analytic expressions for the collective-excitation dispersion, which is quadratic rather than linear.

The critical exponents of the ground state fidelity susceptibility and the correlation length of the system are obtained for the quantum phase transition when the frst vortex is formed. We also find the single-particle entanglement can be {{an indicator of the}} angular momentums for some real ground states.

Depending on the strength of the interactions, a few or a large number of vortices can be formed. In the limit of many vortices, we calculate the density profile of the cloud and show that the vortex lattice stays triangular. We also find that the vortex lattice planes align themselves with the weak axis of the external potential. For a small number of vortices, we numerically solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and find vortex configurations that are very different from the vortex configurations in an axisymmetric <b>rotating</b> <b>trap.</b> Comment: 15 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
