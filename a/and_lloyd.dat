5|$|The True Directions {{kids are}} {{encouraged}} to rebel against Mary by two of her former students, ex-ex-gays Larry <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> (Richard Moll and Wesley Mann), who take the campers to a local gay bar where Graham and Megan's relationship develops into a romance. When Mary discovers the trip, she makes them all picket Larry and Lloyd's house, carrying placards and shouting homophobic abuse. Megan and Graham sneak away one night to have sex and begin to fall in love. When Mary finds out, Megan, now at ease with her sexual identity, is unrepentant. She is made to leave True Directions and, now homeless, goes to stay with Larry <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd.</b> Graham, afraid to defy her father, remains at the camp. Megan and Dolph, who is also living with Larry <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd,</b> plan to win back Graham and Clayton.|$|E
5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the final, the three finalists <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Webber visited Salzburg to visit some of the {{locations}} made famous by The Sound of Music, including Leopoldskron Palace and Nonnberg Abbey, to give the finalists a chance to understand the real Maria von Trapp.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} graphic {{novel by}} Moore <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> was re-released as a hardback collection in October 2005 to tie into the film's original release date of November 5, 2005. The film {{renewed interest in}} Alan Moore's original story, and sales of the original graphic novel rose dramatically in the United States.|$|E

5|$|In May 1981, Paramount Pictures {{acquired}} the film rights, with Stigwood attached as a producer. Paramount allocated {{a budget of}} $15 million, and the film was scheduled to go into production by year-end. To avoid higher production costs, Stigwood, Rice <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Webber each agreed to take a smaller salary but {{a higher percentage of}} the film's gross. Stigwood hired Ken Russell to direct the film, based on the success of their previous collaboration, Tommy (1975).|$|E
5|$|Omaha's {{rich history}} in rhythm and blues, and jazz {{gave rise to}} a number of {{influential}} bands, including Anna Mae Winburn's Cotton Club Boys <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Hunter's Seranaders. Rock and roll pioneer Wynonie Harris, jazz great Preston Love, drummer Buddy Miles, and Luigi Waites are among the city's homegrown talent. Doug Ingle from the late 1960s band Iron Butterfly was born in Omaha, as was indie folk singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, though both were raised elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The 1897–8 {{season at}} Newport saw the {{beginning}} of a 'historic' partnership at half-back between Phillips and Llewellyn Lloyd that lasted till 1901. Phillips <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> were thought of as a pair, both playing along similar lines and sharing the work of scrum-half and outside-half. While Lloyd was a smarter runner, Phillips was a better kick, but both of them could drop goals, and were remarkable in their kicks to touch.|$|E

5|$|The case of Jaggard v. Dickinson (1980) {{held that}} even a drunken belief will support the defence even though this allows {{drunkenness}} to negate basic intent; <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> v. DPP (1992) ruled that a motorist who damages a wheel clamp to free his car, having parked on another's property knowing {{of the risk of}} being clamped, does not have a lawful excuse under the Act even if he makes a mistake of law.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} {{programme}} to allow the public to cast {{a leading role in}} a West End show, and it was initially criticised. However, it won International Emmy and Royal Television Society awards and became {{the first of a series}} of collaborations between the BBC <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Webber, including Any Dream Will Do, I'd Do Anything, and Over the Rainbow. The series also led to versions and similar series abroad.|$|E
5|$|After {{the song}} was composed, Lloyd Webber and Rice were {{struggling}} to find a suitable musical actress for the songs and the titular role, since the only one they knew, Yvonne Elliman, {{had moved to the}} United States. One day they were watching the British musical television show, Rock Follies, where they noticed actress and singer Julie Covington, who played an aspiring rock musician. Covington had played in London musicals like Godspell, and her acting abilities in Rock Follies convinced Rice <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Webber to sign her for Evita.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difference}} is that machinima is created in real time, but other animation is pre-rendered. Real-time engines need to trade quality for speed and use simpler algorithms and models. In the 2001 animated film , every strand of hair on a character's head was independent; real-time needs would likely force them {{to be treated as}} a single unit. Kelland, Morris, <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> argue that improvement in consumer-grade graphics technology will allow more realism; similarly, Paul Marino connects machinima to the increasing computing power predicted by Moore's law. For cut scenes in video games, issues other than visual fidelity arise. Pre-rendered scenes can require more digital storage space, weaken suspension of disbelief through contrast with real-time animation of normal gameplay, and limit interaction.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{sought to}} build an {{interlocking}} series of defence pacts among the remaining European countries {{as a means of}} deterring Hitler from war. He sought an agreement among Britain, France, the USSR and Poland whereby the first three would go to the assistance of Poland if her independence were threatened, but Polish mistrust of the Soviet Union caused those negotiations to fail. Instead, on 31 March 1939, Chamberlain informed an approving House of Commons of British and French guarantees that they would lend Poland all possible aid in the event of any action which threatened Polish independence. In the ensuing debate Eden stated that the nation was now united behind the government. Even Churchill <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> George praised Chamberlain's government for issuing the guarantee to Poland.|$|E
5|$|England won {{the first}} Test with John Snow and David Brown {{claiming}} 13 wickets between them. A draw followed in Lord's, but England won the final match in a dramatic fashion. The West Indies in a seemingly strong position of 219/3 required 84 runs for victory. They suffered a late innings collapse however as Butcher, Sobers <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> fell within 16 minutes, which ultimately led to England winning by 30 runs to win the series 2–0. It seemed that England would begin to dominate the West Indies, {{with many of the}} key West Indian players such as Butcher, Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith retiring in 1969. Illingworth would be the last England captain to win the Wisden Trophy for 31 years.|$|E

5|$|From 1999 through 2002, Banister {{worked as}} Pittsburgh's Major League Field Coordinator on the {{coaching}} staffs of managers Gene Lamont <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> McClendon. He was then assigned {{the job of}} Minor League Field Coordinator, and served in that role from 2003 through 2010. In 2004, he served as the interim manager of Lynchburg when Jay Loviglio resigned from the position due to personal reasons. Banister became the interim pitching coach for Lynchburg in 2008 when Bob Milacki resigned from the position. Mike Steele then took the job from Banister in 2009. Banister managed the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League (AFL) in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 Chamberlain was {{appointed}} {{member of the}} Central Control Board on liquor traffic. In December 1916 the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, offered Chamberlain the new position of Director of National Service with responsibility for co-ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. However, his tenure was marked by conflict with Lloyd George and in August 1917, having received little support from the Prime Minister, Chamberlain resigned. The relationship between Chamberlain <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> George would be one thenceforth of hatred.|$|E
5|$|In December 1994, Alan Parker {{signed on}} to write and direct the film after being {{approached}} by Stigwood and Vajna. Parker also produced the film, with his Dirty Hands Productions banner enlisted as a production company. While drafting his own script, Parker researched Eva's life, compiling newspaper articles, documentaries and English-language books. He refused to borrow elements from Stone's script or the stage play, instead opting to model his script after Rice <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Webber's concept album. Stone had a falling out with Parker over {{the content of the}} script, claiming that he had made significant contributions. A legal dispute and arbitration by the Writers Guild of America resulted in Parker and Stone sharing a screenwriting credit.|$|E

5|$|Jessica {{was born}} in Falmouth, Massachusetts to Lisa Blair Hathaway <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Dubroff {{and moved to the}} San Francisco Bay Area in California when she was four. Although billed by the media as a pilot, Dubroff did not possess a medical {{certificate}} or a student pilot certificate, since they require a minimum age of 16, or a pilot certificate that requires a minimum age of 17, according to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. There was also no record-keeping body {{at the time of her}} trip recognizing any feats by underage pilots. Nevertheless, local, national, and international news media picked up and publicized her story, and closely followed her attempt until its tragic ending.|$|E
5|$|Kelland, Morris, <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> list {{four main}} methods of {{creating}} machinima. From simple to advanced, these are: {{relying on the}} game's AI to control most actions, digital puppetry, recamming, and precise scripting of actions. Although simple to produce, AI-dependent results are unpredictable, thus complicating the realization of a preconceived film script. For example, when Rooster Teeth produced The Strangerhood using The Sims 2, a game that encourages the use of its AI, the group had to create multiple instances of each character to accommodate different moods. Individual instances were selected at different times to produce appropriate actions.|$|E
5|$|On February 12, Michigan lost 75–52 in its rivalry {{game against}} (#8 AP/#8 Coaches) Michigan State. Among those in {{attendance}} were Rick Snyder, Matthew Stafford, Mark Dantonio, Brady Hoke, <b>and</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Carr. It {{marked the first}} time both teams were ranked in the top ten of the AP Poll, and resulted in Michigan losing back-to-back games and three consecutive road games {{for the first time since}} the 2010–11 team did so. Burke's 18 points, 4 assists and 3 steals were one of Michigan's few bright spots in their February 12 contest.|$|E
