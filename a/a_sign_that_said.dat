500|$|In a {{deliberate}} attempt to diversify the business, The Company chose {{to move into}} the fax software market with its WinFax product. Software developer Tony Davis (another South African expatriate who had moved to Canada) was initially hired as a consultant to work on the forms line of products in the late 1980s, soon afterwards becoming part of that team. In his spare time he developed a prototype of what would become the first WinFax product, with the agreement that Delrina would be its publisher. In 1990 Delrina devoted a relatively small space to this new product at that year's COMDEX (a computer trade show), under <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>said</b> simply: [...] "Send a Fax from Your PC". It garnered the most attention of any Delrina product being demonstrated at that show. This interest convinced the founding partners of the commercial viability of the product. Tony Davis went on to sell his product idea to Delrina, and stayed on as its lead software architect and designer.|$|E

[...] The captured students had their heads shaved, were painted orange and black and some were forced to do menial labor for OSU fraternities.

2500|$|Jack Norworth, {{while riding}} a subway train, was {{inspired}} by <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Baseball Today – Polo Grounds". In the song, Katie's beau calls to ask her out to see a show. She accepts the date, but only if her date will take her out to the baseball game. The words were set to music by Albert Von Tilzer. (Norworth and Von Tilzer finally saw their first Major League Baseball games 32 and 20 years later, respectively.) The song was first sung by Norworth's then-wife Nora Bayes and popularized by many other vaudeville acts. It was played at a ballpark for the first known time in 1934, at a high-school game in Los Angeles; it was played later that year during the fourth game of the 1934 World Series.|$|E
2500|$|On December 26, 2010, the Philadelphia Eagles {{home game}} against the visiting Minnesota Vikings was {{postponed}} before any snow had fallen due to an impending blizzard in Philadelphia. Rendell said of the postponement, [...] "My biggest beef {{is that this is}} part of what's happened in this country. We've become a nation of wusses. The Chinese are kicking our butt in everything. If this was in China do you think the Chinese would have called off the game? People would have been marching down to the stadium, they would have walked and they would have been doing calculus on the way down." [...] As a result, the grounds crew piled snow on his reserved seat the following game, and topped it with <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>said</b> [...] "This seat reserved for non-wusses".|$|E
2500|$|The Hunt {{consists}} of three parts. Answering the [...] "opening questions" [...] directs Hunters to five puzzle sites scattered through the Hunt area. Solving the five Hunt puzzles—the answer is always a number—indicates the five authentic clues {{on a list of}} dozens of numbered bogus clues. Hunters have three hours to solve the puzzles, then at 3 p.m., a sixth and final clue is announced from the main stage. This begins the [...] "endgame", which {{is by far the most}} difficult puzzle of the day. Solving the endgame often leads to a phone number, or directs Hunters to go to a certain out-of-the-way location and give a password to someone identified in a cryptic way. In 2007, Hunters who solved the endgame knew they needed to find a sandwich. Only when they arrived at a location marked on the Hunt Map with a sandwich, they saw <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Right idea. Wrong one." [...] In fact, they had to go to a location on the beach, marked with a witch. In other words, a [...] "sand witch." [...] If they went to that spot on the beach, they saw a Hunt volunteer wearing a witch's hat and holding a broom.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{journalists and}} writers {{have written about}} Kishore Kumar's {{seemingly}} eccentric behavior. He placed <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Beware of Kishore" [...] {{at the door of}} his Warden Road flat. Once, producer-director H. S. Rawail, who owed him some money, visited his flat to pay the dues. Kumar took the money and when Rawail offered to shake hands with him, reportedly Kishore put Rawail's hand in his mouth, bit it and asked [...] "Didn’t you see the sign?". Rawail laughed off the incident and left quickly. According to another reported incident, once Kumar was due to record a song for producer-director G. P. Sippy. As Sippy approached his bungalow, he saw Kumar going out in his car. Sippy asked Kumar to stop his car but Kumar increased his speed. Sippy chased him to Madh Island where Kumar finally stopped his car near the ruined Madh Fort. When Sippy questioned his strange behavior, Kumar refused to recognize or talk to him and threatened to call the police. The next morning, Kumar reported for the recording session. An angry Sippy questioned him about his behaviour the previous day but Kumar said that Sippy must have dreamt the incident and said that he was in Khandwa on the previous day.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>said</b> '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the same}} interview, Ottley {{expressed}} his {{opinion on the}} submission process used by many aspiring artists, when he said, [...] "I {{was talking to a}} DC editor once at <b>a</b> store <b>signing</b> <b>that</b> <b>said</b> in the last 15 years of working there they've accepted ONE artist through submissions, and I've heard Marvel is even less. It just doesn't work that well. The best way is get your name out there on your own somehow.|$|R

He came across <b>an</b> {{electronic}} <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>said,</b> “All unattended luggage will be destroyed.” Since the sign could only fit one word at a time, he waited until the word destroyed. appeared and snapped a shot. It was used as the cover art for the album and also for the corresponding photography book because it made sense to him when he listened to the contents of the album.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the loss}} in the series, Derek Jeter {{provided}} one bright spot. Despite a very poor series overall, batting under [...]200, he got the nickname, [...] "Mr. November", for his walk-off home run in Game 4, though it began October 31, as the game ended in the first minutes of November 1. In calling the home run, Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay said [...] "See ya! See ya! See ya! A home run for Derek Jeter! He is Mr. November! Oh what a home run by Derek Jeter!"
