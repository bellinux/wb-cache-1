5|$|Following an announcement, in August 2015, that {{tennis player}} Sania Mirza {{was to be}} awarded, a Public-Interest Litigation was filed in the Karnataka High Court. The petitioner, Paralympic athlete H. N. Girisha, {{mentioned}} that his performance was ignored by the committee. Girisha {{claimed to be a}} top contender for the award with 90 points, owing to his silver medal winning act at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the Men's High Jump F42 event. The petition mentioned that the points for Mirza's Grand Slam titles from 2011 until 2015 should not be counted as the events were {{not a part of the}} list of sports events to be considered for the performance evaluation. The court withheld the conferment and sought replies from the Ministry <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>selection</b> process.

Sharmarke was considered someone who could potentially bridge the gap between the various groups currently competing for influence in Somalia, as he was based abroad and thus not tied to local politics. Sharmarke's appointment was also seen by some analysts as an attempt to secure the favor of the large Darod clan, whose Majeerteen branch both Sharmarke and the outgoing President of Somalia, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, are members of.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Internetware {{is built}} upon the {{coordination}} of the heterogeneous, autonomous software entities in the open coordination environment. But {{it is very difficult}} to select the honest coordination software entities with dependable quality of services to build the trusted Internetware because of the openness and dynamic of the Internet. Trust relationships among software entities will provide important information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>selections</b> of trusted coordination entities. The trust relationships are always changing along with the co-operations of software entities. However, the existing trust models cannot support the automatic formation and update of the trust relationships among entities, and cannot reflect the dynamic attribute of the trust relationships. This paper presents a trust measurement and evolution model for the Internetware. The model abstracts the process of the trust measurement, transfer and combination rationally and provides a reasonable approach to form and update trust relationship...|$|R
