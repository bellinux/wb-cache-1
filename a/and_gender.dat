Relying on migrants' narratives, the paper demonstrates how migrants' transition to motherhood is shaped by their particular, fractured journeys. It shows how motherhood creates both specific <b>and</b> <b>gendered</b> spaces for agency <b>and</b> particular <b>and</b> <b>gendered</b> constraints upon agency that shape women migrants' mobility dynamics in space and time...|$|R

5|$|Modern {{historians have}} taken new {{approaches}} to analyzing both traditional and modern Ethiopian historiography. For instance, Donald Crummey (1941–2013) investigated instances in Ethiopian historiography dealing with class, ethnicity, <b>and</b> <b>gender.</b> He also criticized earlier approaches made by Sylvia Pankhurst (1882–1960) and Richard Pankhurst (1927–2017), who focused primarily on the Ethiopian ruling class while ignoring marginalized peoples and minority groups in Ethiopian historical works. Following the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution and overthrow of the Solomonic dynasty with the deposition of Haile Selassie, the historical materialism of Marxist historiography came to dominate the academic landscape and understanding of Northeast African history. In her 2001 article Women in Ethiopian History: A Bibliographic Review, Belete Bizuneh remarks {{that the impact of}} social history on African historiography in the 20th century generated an unprecedented focus on the roles of women <b>and</b> <b>gender</b> in historical societies, but that Ethiopian historiography seems to have fallen outside the orbit of these historiographic trends.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account for differences in sex <b>and</b> <b>gender.</b> for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex <b>and</b> <b>gender</b> in their research.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the self-concepts and body {{cathexis}} of both males and females engaged in an eleven week weight training course and to examine if differences in gender role would influence the relationship of strength to self-concept and body cathexis.

Strength measures were obtained. Group by <b>gender</b> ANOVA <b>and</b> ANCOVA examined differences between and among the groups <b>and</b> <b>genders.</b> Gender role by <b>gender</b> ANOVA <b>and</b> ANCOVA examined differences between and among the androgynous and masculine typed males and females.

5|$|Academic {{journals}} and conferences, however, {{have continued to}} comment on the theme of race within the game.

Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping had never been in intention of Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take care of itself, and at the mercy of Western influences.|$|E
