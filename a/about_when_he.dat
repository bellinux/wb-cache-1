That group originally started out as Ted Healy and His Stooges, an act that toured the vaudeville circuit.

25|$|Some historians {{emphasize}} that Civil War soldiers were driven by political ideology, holding firm {{beliefs about the}} importance of liberty, Union, or state rights, or about the need to protect or to destroy slavery. Others point to less overtly political reasons to fight, such as the defense of one's home and family, or the honor and brotherhood to be preserved when fighting alongside other men. Most historians agree that, no matter what he thought <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> went into the war, the experience of combat affected him profoundly and sometimes affected his reasons for continuing to fight.|$|E
25|$|John Boyd as James Aubrey (seasons 10–12), {{a junior}} FBI agent working under Booth. Originally, Aubrey tries to win Booth's {{approval}} and trust, as Booth is reluctant due to Aubrey's inexperience, however he is eventually accepted by Booth {{and the rest}} of the team. Aubrey gets along with everyone and his love of food is often joked <b>about.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> was a child, his father was an investment broker who cheated his clients and fled the country, abandoning Aubrey and his mother and leaving them with nothing. In season 11, it is found out that Aubrey's father is back in the country.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that I can find in Being and Event that the author really understands what he is talking <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> invokes (as he constantly does) Georg Cantor's theory of transfinite cardinals, the axioms of set theory, Gödel's incompleteness proof or Paul Cohen's proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis. When these things appear in Badiou's texts it is always allusively, with fragments of symbolism detached from the context that endows them with sense, and often with free variables and bound variables colliding randomly. No proof is clearly stated or examined, and the jargon of set theory is waved like a magician's wand, to give authority to bursts of all but unintelligible metaphysics.|$|E

He told police that he had just assumed that she had gone back to live with her family when she failed to return. But investigators became more interested in him when they learned that he had a prior criminal record, including one arrest for identity theft and later convictions for public intoxication and destruction of property after a 2006 incident where he smashed a woman's car window. He also reportedly gave them inconsistent answers to questions <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had seen the Hyundai parked outside the apartment.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} to Lizaveta Prokofyevna and General Yepanchin that their {{daughter}} {{is in love with}} the Prince, but Aglaya denies this and angrily dismisses talk of marriage. She continues to mock and reproach him, often in front of others, and lets slip that, as far as she is concerned, the problem of Nastassya Filippovna is yet to be resolved. Myshkin himself merely experiences an uncomplicated joy in her presence and is mortified when she appears to be angry with him. Lizaveta Prokofyevna feels it is time to introduce the Prince to their aristocratic circle and a dinner party is arranged for this purpose, to be attended by a number of eminent and influential persons. Aglaya, who does not share her parents' respect for these people and is afraid that Myshkin's eccentricity will not meet with their approval, tries to tell him how to behave, but ends by sarcastically telling him to be as eccentric as he likes, and to be sure to wave his arms <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> is pontificating on some high-minded subject and break her mother's priceless Chinese vase. Feeling her anxiety, Myshkin too becomes extremely anxious, but he tells her that it is nothing compared to the joy he feels in her company. He tries to approach the subject of Nastasya Filippovna again, but she silences him and hurriedly leaves.|$|E

Miyazaki had previously directed films such as My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service, which were for small children and teenagers, but he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read shōjo manga magazines like [...] Nakayoshi and Ribon the girls had left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on [...] "crushes" [...] and romance. When looking at his young friends, Miyazaki felt this was not what they [...] "held dear in their hearts" [...] and decided to produce the film about a girl heroine whom they could look up to instead.|$|E

In a statement accompanying the release of {{what became known as the}} [...] "Smoking Gun Tape" [...] on August 5, 1974, Nixon accepted blame for misleading the country <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had been told of White House involvement, stating that he had a lapse of memory. Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott, Senator Barry Goldwater, and House Minority Leader John Jacob Rhodes met with Nixon soon after. [...] Rhodes told Nixon that he faced certain impeachment in the House.

500|$|In high school, Coimbre {{played in}} a school league in the {{positions}} of pitcher and second baseman. His incursion in organized baseball came <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was recommended {{by a member of}} the Leones de Ponce, to the team officials. The Leones de Ponce was the local team of the Puerto Rican amateur league who was to play in a series against the San Juan Athletics. During that season the team needed additional players and he was selected by the team's owner, Pipo Maldonado. He debuted in a game that took place in Ponce, where he was given the position of right fielder and he had [...] four hits in five at bats. He continued in the team and in 1928 participated in a championship series between his team and the team of Guayama, where Ponce won on six games. In the last game of this series Coimbre pitched and won with a final score of 53, in a game where the team almost lost following an error.|$|E

500|$|When Tom Norman {{first saw}} Merrick, he was {{dismayed by the}} extent of his deformities, fearing his {{appearance}} might be too horrific to be a successful novelty. Nevertheless, he exhibited Merrick in the back of an empty shop on Whitechapel Road. Merrick had an iron bed with a curtain drawn around to afford him some privacy. Norman observed Merrick asleep one morning and learned that he always slept sitting up, with his legs drawn up and his head resting on his knees. His enlarged head was too heavy to allow him to sleep lying down and, as Merrick put it, he would risk [...] "waking with a broken neck". Norman decorated the shop with posters that had been created by Hitchcock, depicting a monstrous half-man, half-elephant. A pamphlet titled [...] "The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick" [...] was created, outlining Merrick's life to date. This biography, whether written by Merrick or not, provided a generally accurate account of his life. It contained an incorrect date of birth but, throughout his life, Merrick was vague <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was born.|$|E
500|$|... "Simpsons Bible Stories" [...] was co-written by Matt Selman, Larry Doyle and Tim Long, and was {{the first}} episode Nancy Kruse {{directed}} for The Simpsons. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April4,1999, the day Easter took place that year. According to executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully, the idea for the episode was conceived when Fox requested an Easter-themed Simpsons episode that would air on the holiday. Normally, Fox would not broadcast any new Simpsons episodes on Easter, as it is considered a [...] "low-ratings night", but [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories" [...] was an exception. However, according to co-writer Selman, the idea for the episode came <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> and former staff writer Dan Greaney were pitching episode ideas for the tenth season with former staff writer Donick Cary. Cary and Greaney suggested a [...] "bible-trilogy" [...] story, which then became [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories". [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories" [...] is the first of the trilogy episodes which, since the season 12 episode [...] "Simpsons Tall Tales", The Simpsons produces once every season.|$|E
500|$|The {{environment}} in Lody's boarding-house was becoming increasingly hostile; his hosts were growing suspicious of him. Their doubts grew as the ongoing espionage scare progressed. He had {{stayed there for}} more than three weeks and his evasive answers when questioned <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> expected to leave did not satisfy them. When they said that his accent appeared to be [...] "more German than American", he knew it was time to go. He wrote in his letter of 27 September that [...] "the fear of espionage is very great and every day I see some Germans going to Redford Barracks under the escort of a soldier... It is advisable for me to vanish for a few days, and to change my place of abode. I can only hope that my telegraphic and letter information have duly arrived." [...] He told his controllers that he would go to Ireland, disembarking at Dublin as it was the only Irish port not closed to foreigners. Despite his hopes, his letter was intercepted by the British; this time it was retained as the information therein was of genuine military value.|$|E

500|$|The early {{influences}} on his art style {{were from the}} West. [...] Like most of the Malaysian children in the 1950s, Lat watched Hanna-Barbera cartoons (The Flintstones and The Jetsons) on television and read imported British comics, such as The Dandy and The Beano. [...] He studied them and used their styles and themes in his early doodles. [...] After the foreign influences in his works were noticed by a family friend, Lat was advised by his father to observe and draw upon ideas from their surroundings instead. [...] Heeding the advice, the young cartoonist intimated himself with local happenings. [...] Tiga Sekawan was conceived as a humorous crime-fighting story of a local flavour. [...] Keluarga Si Mamat and its protagonist were named after his youngest brother Mamat, its stories based on Lat's observations of his fellow villagers and schoolmates. [...] The inspiration for his cartoons about Bersunat came <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was on assignment at a hospital. [...] As he was taking breaks from investigating the dead victims of crime brought to the morgue, Lat chanced upon the circumcisions performed by the hospital on ethnic Malay boys. [...] He found their experiences clinical, devoid of the elaborate and personal ceremonies that celebrated his own rite to manhood in the village. [...] Lat felt compelled to illustrate the differences between life in his kampung and the city.|$|E
500|$|When {{the agents}} track down Chantara, whose face is pixelated, {{she claims that}} her pimp {{attacked}} Ricky and fears that he will kill her. She pleads with the agents for protection. Mulder and Scully have Wetzel guard Chantara while they assist the police in the raid of a crack house. However, the two are drawn back outside when Wetzel [...] encounters the entity, wildly shooting at it. Inside a police car, the agents find Chantara with her neck broken. When Mulder questions Wetzel, {{he admits that he}} thought he saw the [...] "wasp man", a monster his older brother told him <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was a kid. Though other deputies express skepticism, Mulder finds flattened bullets; indicating they physically impacted something, though no trace is found of what they struck. Mulder formulates a theory that the entity changes its form to correspond with its victims' worst fears. Wetzel, Ricky, and Chantara all expressed fear shortly before their run-ins with the entity; it was visible to them, but not to others. The agents think that Steve and Edy may be the entity's next target because they were in the vicinity of Ricky's attack. They head to their house, only to find the couple {{in the middle of an}} argument. After Edy expresses fear of a separation from Steve, the couple reconciles. Based on this situation, Mulder proposes that the entity ignored Steve and Edy because they did not exhibit mortal fear.|$|E
500|$|Richie Egan is the {{principal}} songwriter but refers to the overall band as Jape. This came about following his first few solo performances when he realised he did not wish people to consider him a singer-songwriter {{but as part of}} a band. Egan has been part of many bands from a young age, and spent his youth experimenting with four-track tape recorders and sounds. He was previously a member of the bands Black Belt Jones and Sir Killalot. After leaving Black Belt Jones he {{went on to become the}} bassist in the instrumental rock band The Redneck Manifesto of which he is still a member. He has occasionally toured as part of David Kitt’s live band, as well as in Conor J. O'Brien's band Villagers as a bass player and with his bandmates in The Redneck Manifesto. By 2003 Egan had developed Jape after spending a week at the family home of fellow Redneck, Niall Byrne, in Avoca, County Wicklow. [...] "I’ve been playing in bands since I was really young but I’ve always been messing around on the side with four-track tape recorders, experimenting with sounds". [...] "The chance to turn this “messing around” into something concrete came <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was given the opportunity to decamp to Avoca, where fellow Redneck, Niall’s family own a house.
