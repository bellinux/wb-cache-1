50|$|Structural {{composites}} in the F-35 are 35% of the airframe weight (up from 25% in the F-22). The {{majority of}} these are bismaleimide (BMI) and composite epoxy material. The F-35 {{will be the first}} mass-produced aircraft to include structural nanocomposites, namely carbon nanotube reinforced epoxy. Experience of the F-22's problems with corrosion led to the F-35 using a gap filler that causes less galvanic corrosion to the airframe's skin, designed with fewer gaps requiring filler and implementing better drainage. The relatively short 35-foot wingspan of the A and B variants is set by the F-35B's requirement to fit inside the Navy's current <b>amphibious</b> <b>assault</b> ship parking <b>area</b> and elevators; the F-35C's longer wing is considered to be more fuel efficient.|$|R

50|$|<b>Amphibious</b> <b>assault</b> {{ships are}} the centerpieces of US amphibious warfare and fulfill the same power {{projection}} role as aircraft carriers except that their striking force centers on land forces instead of aircraft.

Resembling small aircraft carriers, <b>amphibious</b> <b>assault</b> ships are capable of V/STOL, STOVL, VTOL, tiltrotor, and rotary wing aircraft operations.

Recently, <b>amphibious</b> <b>assault</b> ships have begun to be deployed as the core of an expeditionary strike group, which usually consists of an additional amphibious transport dock and dock landing ship for amphibious warfare and an Aegis-equipped cruiser and destroyer, frigate, and attack submarine for group defense. <b>Amphibious</b> <b>assault</b> ships are typically named after World War II aircraft carriers.|$|R
