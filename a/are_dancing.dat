While the singer disappears from vision, people dance until she appears again dancing to the song. Then she goes to a hallway and enters a red-lighted room, accompanied by dancers, where entertainer Mimi Marks is seen. There she dances another routine along with her dancers. After dancing, she enters in another hallway where she gets alone with a man, until they share a kiss. Then, people who were in the previous room enter to the hallway to connect to another room, with Marks taking Jackson with her. The video ends with people coming closer to Jackson.|$|E

5|$|A concert film, Under Great White Northern Lights premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 18, 2009. The film, {{directed}} by Emmett Malloy, documents the band's summer 2007 tour across Canada and contains live concert and off-stage footage. Jack and Meg White {{appeared at the}} premiere and made a short speech before the movie started about their love of Canada and why they chose to debut their movie in Toronto. The tour was {{in support of the}} album Icky Thump, and they performed in every province. Jack conceived the idea of touring Canada after learning that Scottish relatives on his father's side had lived for a few generations in Nova Scotia before relocating to Detroit to work in the car factories. Additionally, their 10th anniversary occurred during the tour on the day of their show in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, and in this shot, Jack and Meg <b>are</b> <b>dancing</b> {{at the conclusion of the}} concert. The film was {{directed by}} a friend of the duo, Emmett Malloy. A second feature, titled Under Nova Scotian Lights, was prepared for the DVD release.|$|E

He passes through Fallon, Nevada {{to meet up with}} the seductive Joely (Jena Malone), his middle school crush. In Reno, they take ecstasy and almost have sex before Mercer resumes his search for Arlen.

Joely asks Mercer if he can drive her cousin Buddy (Colin Fickes) and his friend Rid (William Lee Scott) to Mojave, California, where they are building their own car.

Not wanting to get sidetracked, he tries to leave the others behind in a motel room, but when Buddy threatens to steal the car, Mercer tells him that the car belongs to his girlfriend, and Buddy, Rid, and Joely leave without Mercer in Kate's car.

25|$|While other {{countries}} seem {{to use these}} spots to create a safe environment for women, there has been controversy across the media in regards to sexism, since China {{is the only country}} that has made these spots significantly bigger. At the Wonder Mall in Hebei, there is an entire parking garage reserved for women, which contains spaces that were 80 centimeters larger than regular parking spaces. If women have trouble parking in the significantly bigger lots, there <b>are</b> <b>dancing</b> parking-lot employees designated to park the cars for them. The walls in the women-only parking garage are designed with the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac/horoscope as a precaution for female drivers who can remember a picture better than a parking space number.|$|E

Don Quixote approaches Gamache and challenges him to a duel for having refused a dying man's wish. Gamache declines to fight and the merrymakers drive him out of the inn. Taking pity, Lorenzo agrees to unite Basilio and Kitri. At this moment, Basilio pulls out the sword and tells everyone it was a joke.|$|E
25|$|The arena {{director}} {{is the person}} in charge during the pow wow. Sometimes the arena {{director is}} referred to as the whip man, sometimes the whip man is the arena director's assistant, and many pow wows don't have a whip man. The arena director makes sure dancers <b>are</b> <b>dancing</b> during the pow wow and that the drum groups know what type of song to sing. If there are contests the arena director is ultimately responsible for providing judges, though they often have another assistant who is the head judge. The arena director is also responsible for organizing any ceremonies that may be required during the pow wow, such as when an eagle feather is dropped, and others as required. One of the main duties of the arena director is to ensure that the dance arena is treated with the proper respect from visitors to the pow wow.|$|E

Fashion designer Phillip Lim lent several outfits of his to Oh Land for the video, which she declared was [...] "so simple and clean, but [...] still has a playfulness to it".

At one point in the episode, the Simpsons visit the Maasai people, a Nilotic ethnic group of semi-nomadic people located in Kenya and northern Tanzania. The way that some of the Maasai people in the episode <b>are</b> <b>dancing</b> is also true to a traditional dance performed by Maasai people in real life, and although the drinking of cow blood is faithful to the Maasai people's culture, the use of lip plates and neck rings are not. [...] "That was kind of fun for me to try to make this stuff [...] as crazy as the story is, [...] make it realistic", Kirkland commented on directing the episode.|$|E

During the chorus, clones of members of the band appear as they <b>are</b> <b>dancing.</b> During Ewen's verse, her reference to shoes prompts a pair of green high heels to emerge in the background. The group begins dancing together in the chorus while clones of them appear again. The video ends with Sugababes dancing while making hand gesture to represent a [...] "kiss". Ann Lee of Metro described the video as [...] "futuristic". Nick Levine from Digital Spy praised the video as an [...] "absolute cracker".|$|E

500|$|Creative {{director}} Gregoire Spillmann {{argued that}} existing dance games were merely instructing players to press buttons with their feet, rather than actually dance. Acknowledging Dance Dance Revolution players who use its gameplay {{as a base}} for their own dance routines, Spiller likened Just Dance to be a reversal of the concept, in which the dance moves themselves were [...] "fit" [...] into the gameplay, and could be applied outside the game as well. The team deliberately focused on building the mechanics of Just Dance solely around the Wii Remote, eschewing dedicated accessories such as dance pads, arm or leg bands, as well as the Nunchuck attachment. Spillmann explained that such accessories were [...] "distractions" [...] that restricted the motion of players; for instance, the team felt that the Nunchuck's short cord limited how it could be used in routines, and that removing it helped the game focus less on precision and more on letting players feel like they <b>are</b> <b>dancing.</b> [...] The lack of dedicated peripheral also contrasted with other music games that utilized increasingly intricate and expensive controllers.|$|E
500|$|Two {{music videos}} for [...] "Carry Out" [...] were shot. The first video, shot in December 2009, {{consisted}} of live performance footage of Timbaland and Timberlake. The video {{was due to}} be released in January 2010. In late January 2010, it was announced that a new video was going to be shot with director Bryan Barber. The video made its premiere on February 18, 2010. The video begins with sequences of several women dancing in underwear in front of light sing saying [...] "Drive In" [...] and [...] "Hot Cakes". Scenes of Timbaland and Timberlake in front of the signs are also shown. Scenes are intercut showing Timbaland and his brother in a car watching girls skating around it. During the chorus the performers <b>are</b> <b>dancing</b> in front of the sings along girl dancers. Scenes are intercut and show separate scenes of Timbaland and Timberlake sitting on throne chairs while girls with plates full of food are around them. The video ends with several girls seductively eating cakes.|$|E
500|$|One of Busch's notable {{stories is}} Der Virtuos (1865), which {{describes}} {{the life of}} a pianist who plays privately for an excited listener. Satirizing the self-publicizing artist's attitude and his overblown adoration, it varies from Busch's other stories as each scene does not contain prose, but is defined with music terminology, such as [...] "Introduzione", [...] "Maestoso" [...] and [...] "Fortissimo vivacissimo". As the scenes increase in tempo, each part of his body and lappet run around. The penultimate scene again depicts the pianist's movements, with score sheets floating above the grand piano on which musical notes <b>are</b> <b>dancing.</b> Over the years graphic artists have been fascinated by Der Virtuos. August Macke, in a letter to gallery owner Herwarth Walden, described Busch as the first Futurist, stating how well he captured time and movement. Similar pioneering scenes are in Bilder zur Jobsiade (1872). Job fails to answer rather easy questions set by twelve clergy, who shake their heads in synchronicity. Each scene is a movement study that presages Eadweard Muybridge's photography. Muybridge began his work in 1872, not released until 1893.|$|E
