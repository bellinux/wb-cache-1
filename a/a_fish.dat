2500|$|Angling is <b>a</b> {{method of}} <b>fishing</b> {{by means of}} an [...] "angle" [...] (fish hook). The hook is usually {{attached}} to <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> line and the line is often attached to <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> rod. Fishing rods are usually fitted with <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> reel that functions as a mechanism for storing, retrieving and paying out the line. The hook itself can be dressed with lures or bait. A bite indicator such as a float, and a weight or sinker are sometimes used.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>fishing</b> reel is <b>a</b> device {{used for}} the {{deployment}} and retrieval of <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> line using <b>a</b> spool mounted on <b>an</b> axle. <b>Fishing</b> reels are traditionally used in angling. They are most often {{used in conjunction with}} <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> rod, though some specialized reels are mounted on crossbows or to boat gunwales or transoms. The earliest known illustration of <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> reel is from Chinese paintings and records beginning about 1195 A.D. Fishing reels first appeared in England around 1650 A.D., and by the 1760s, London tackle shops were advertising multiplying or gear-retrieved reels. Paris, Kentucky native George Snyder is generally given credit for inventing the first fishing reel in America around 1820, a bait casting design that quickly became popular with American anglers.|$|R

5|$|Irrigation {{with water}} from the Merced River {{continued}} to grow substantially until most of the arable land around the river, some , was under cultivation. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley was {{to such an extent}} that many of the rivers ran dry in sections. Upriver of the Merced River confluence with the San Joaquin, the latter river was usually dry, only regaining flow where the Merced River enters. In the mid-20th century, the flow in the Merced River diminished to such a degree that very few salmon returned to spawn in the lower section of the Merced River. In 1991, <b>a</b> <b>fish</b> hatchery, the Merced River Hatchery, was built beside the Merced River just downstream of the Crocker-Huffman Diversion Dam, the lowermost Merced River dam.

The fish learn that Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who previously killed <b>a</b> <b>fish</b> by constantly shaking its bag. Gill then reveals his plan to escape, jamming the tank's filter with a pebble. The fish would be placed in plastic bags so that the dentist can clean the tank, and then they would roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam the filter, but fails, almost getting himself killed in the process. Near the harbor, a pelican, Nigel, flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's adventure. Inspired by his father's determination, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. Unlike the first attempt, he is able to successfully render the filter useless, but to the tank gang's dismay, the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.|$|E
