5000|$|Echogenicity (misspelled {{sometimes}} as echogenecity) {{is the ability}} to bounce an echo, e.g. return the signal in ultrasound examinations. In other words, echogenicity is higher when the surface bouncing the sound echo reflects increased sound waves. Tissues that have higher echogenicity are called [...] "hyperechogenic" [...] <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> represented with lighter colors on images in medical ultrasonography. In contrast, tissues with lower echogenicity are called [...] "hypoechogenic" [...] <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> represented with darker colors. Areas that lack echogenicity are called [...] "anechogenic" [...] <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> displayed as completely dark.|$|R

Individual flowers open sequentially from bottom to top within each inflorescence, the rate varying with the time of day: more flowers open during the day than at night, with a peak rate of around two to three florets per hour during the first few hours of daylight, when honeyeater foraging is also at its peak.|$|E
