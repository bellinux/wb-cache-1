50|$|Most {{revolving}} cylinder, <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> designs utilize a fixed, multi-lobed barrel-type cam and rollers on the pistons {{to control}} the reciprocating movement of the pistons. The benefit of this approach, versus a conventional crankshaft-and-connecting-rod mechanism, is that the kinematics of the piston motion can be optimized with regards to combustion cycle efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{drawback}} to the revolving cylinder, <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> design is that rotating piston assemblies {{are subjected to}} centrifugal forces, which can result in significant friction losses. These centrifugal forces increase at {{the square of the}} angular velocity. So unless the engine is run at very low rotational speeds, the friction losses due to centrifugal forces acting on the piston assemblies can quickly become unacceptable.|$|E
50|$|The primary claimed {{benefit of}} the {{revolving}} cylinder, <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> is that a four-cycle, reciprocating piston engine can be achieved {{without the need for}} a complex and expensive valve train. The intake and exhaust flows are controlled by simple ports in the cylinder heads. Costs are further reduced because all cylinders {{at each end of the}} engine share a common fuel injector and/or spark plug. Additionally, the designs are typically compact and lightweight.|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} for continuous, long-term oriented {{planning of}} technological and capacity related factory developments Apart {{from having to}} successfully manage, in the short-term, the turbulences of their operative business, factories are also facing the enormous challenge of responding effectively to changes in capacity and technology, which on account of long-term, slow-reacting adaptive measures, need to be detected as early as possible. A pragmatic and project based approach, widely encountered in practice due to significant time pressures, reaches its limits due to the increasing complexity and dynamics of the subject matter. Customizing technological and capacity related plant development requires a forward looking and systematic approach capable of immediately taking into account changes in underlying conditions. For this reason, this dissertation developed a continuous planning method which models a plant's specific development processes on an on-going, long-term basis, in order to promptly detect the effects of changing conditions and increase their adaptive capacity in a systematic manner. Taking into account the strategic goals of the company's business plans, standardized criteria were inferred for evaluating development concepts. These, in turn, permit a quantitative analysis of changes in technology and capacity and can serve as aids in a decision making process. Alternative factory development concepts are simulated by varying initial parameters in a software-planning tool (PLANT DEVELOPMENT PLANNER) developed {{as part of this}} study, then compared to one another and analysed according to the evaluation criteria. The practicability of this method of plant development planning was investigated and verified in the field in the industrial production of <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engines...</b>|$|R
40|$|Pressure and {{performance}} requirements of <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pumps {{and the proportion}} of churning losses in <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pumps increase significantly with increasing speed. To investigate the primary distribution of churning losses in <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pumps at various ranges of speed, a test rig was set up in which other friction losses can be eliminated, thus making it possible to investigate the net churning losses in an <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pump. The influence of the rotating cylinder block and pistons on churning losses is analyzed based on a qualitative evaluation of the various fluid flow regimes at different test speeds in an <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pump. The analytical results indicate that pistons have less influence on churning losses than the rotating cylinder block beyond the critical speed in <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pumps, because the total energy dissipation transforms laminar viscous friction losses into turbulent shear stress losses. It is concluded that more attention should be given to the effect of the rotating cylinder block on churning losses in <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pumps at high rotation speed...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the study}} {{involving}} the design and implementation of <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pump control systems, an accurate, dynamic model of a <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pump is required. In this thesis, the complete derivation of such a model is presented. The derivation is performed symbolically, using general geometrical coordinates and parameters of a typical <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pump, rather than specific values. Therefore, the developed model should be applicable to other types of <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pumps with similar configurations. The developed model is expressed by a set of highly nonlinear mathematical equations, these equations being functions of pump parameters and operating conditions. When the specific values of these various parameters were substituted into the describing equations, it was found, for the pump used in this study, that the model could be simplified to a set of linear expressions. In addition, the experimental results indicate that the developed model accurately predicts the dynamic response of a particular pump - a Vickers PVB 5 <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pump...|$|R
50|$|Problems {{associated}} with {{the design of the}} <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> include high oil consumption, high fuel consumption, low rpm limit imposed by previously discussed frictional loads, low overall horsepower, mechanical complexity and complex machining methods needs to allow the engine {{to stand up to the}} loads imposed on the components. Additional problems are noted in that, the design does not have a long lifespan when compared to other engine designs due to large numbers of moving parts and relative high stresses. Wear and tear occurs at a faster rate because the engine makes more power pulses per turn of the cam than traditional engines. Lastly, due to very high initial torque and a need for large amounts of coolant, loss of oil or coolant to this design during running will almost certainly result in a catastrophic explosion of the engine because the engine generally has very light casings or shields located in the area around the cams and connecting rods.|$|E

The prominent disadvantage is a high noise level. The noise emitted from an <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pump can be divided into structure-borne noise, fluid-borne noise and airborne noise [4]. The structure-borne noise is generated by various internal forces and moments, and the fluid-borne noise is produced by flow ripples in the inlet and outlet ports [5]. Both structure-borne noise and fluid-borne noise contribute to the generation of airborne noise.|$|R

40|$|Development of an {{asymmetric}} <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pump for displacement-controlled system Jiahai Huang 1, 2, Hu Zhao 1, Long Quan 1, 2 and Xiaogang Zhang 1 Pump-controlled {{systems can}} eliminate throttling losses {{and improve the}} work efficiency of mobile hydraulic system. But one difficult problem for that is the differential volumetric flow through a single rod cylinder which is widely used in mobile hydraulic system. Several solutions have been presented {{to deal with it}} so far, but there still has not been a cost-effective solution to it. In recent years, an asymmetric pump-controlled asymmetric cylinder strategy has been presented to deal with this problem. In order to achieve this goal, an asymmetric <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pump with three ports was developed in this research. The flow rate ratio of the three ports of asymmetric <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pump was designed as 1 ::(1), in which was the area ratio of a single rod cylinder. An important task in the development of asymmetric <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pump was the design of the valve plate. There were three intake/discharge slots (slots A, B, and T) in the valve plate. The pumping dynamics of a fixed displacement asymmetric <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pump were investigated using software package ITI-SimulationX and the performances of its prototype were tested. Simulation and experimental results show that with careful design, a V-shaped cross-section groove at the leading side of slot T can effectively improve the performance of asymmetric <b>axial</b> <b>piston</b> pump, and delivery pressure performance of port B is better than that of port T. Therefore, port T should be linked with low-pressure sources such as accumulator, and port B can be connected to high pressure sources.
