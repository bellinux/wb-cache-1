5|$|Apart {{from some}} early season games for MCC and A. J. Webbe's XI, all of Bosanquet's cricket in 1901 was for Middlesex. He {{maintained}} his faster style of bowling but {{also began to}} bowl slow leg breaks, with the as-yet unrecognised googly mixed in as variation. Later, he found he could not effectively maintain both styles and decided to concentrate on spin, gradually dropping his quick bowling. His bowling brought him 36 wickets <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 37.52 in 1901 but did not take more than three wickets in a single innings. With the bat, it took until July for him to pass fifty runs in an innings but his form improved in August with four fifties. He ended the season with consecutive centuries against Surrey and Essex. In total, Bosanquet scored 1,240 runs <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 32.63, and Warner regarded {{him as one of}} the three most reliable batsmen in the Middlesex side. After the season, Bosanquet went on his third tour of America, captaining a team himself. From January to April 1902, he toured the West Indies with Richard Bennett's team. He scored 623 runs <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 34.61 with five fifties and 55 wickets <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 15.47, including figures of eight for 30 in one innings. Bosanquet's cricket followed a similar pattern in 1902. He scored 749 runs <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 24.96, with a century against Cambridge. However, he did not pass fifty after the end of May until his last game of the season. With the ball, he took 40 wickets <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 21.17. These included 10 wickets against Oxford and 10 against Nottinghamshire; the latter performance, when he took seven for 57 in the second innings was described as remarkable by Wisden. It {{was the first time that}} his new bowling style attracted attention, although Bosanquet himself tried to play down the success for fear of alerting batsmen to his googly.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} his career, Ahsan {{had taken}} 27 wickets in 12 Test matches <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> nearly 50, {{including}} two five-wicket hauls. He made 61 runs, his highest score was 14.|$|E

5|$|During the tour, Peel {{made his}} Test debut and played all five matches. His first Test began on 12 December 1884. Opening the bowling, took eight wickets in the match; {{in the second}} innings, he took five for 51 on a pitch {{affected}} by rain. He was less effective in the remaining games, ending the series with 21 wickets <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 21.47, and scored 37 runs <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 7.40. He was not selected in the next Test matches played by England, against Australia in 1886, and missed the next English tour of Australia, {{in the winter of}} 1886–87, again organised by Shaw, Shrewsbury and Lillywhite.|$|E
5|$|Hedley Verity (18 May 1905– 31 July 1943) was a {{professional}} cricketer who played for Yorkshire and England between 1930 and 1939.

Named {{as one of the}} Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1932, he is {{regarded as one of the}} most effective slow left-arm bowlers to have played cricket. Never someone who spun the ball sharply, he achieved success through the accuracy of his bowling. On pitches which made batting difficult, particularly ones affected by rain, he could be almost impossible to bat against.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, he {{made his}} Twenty20 debut and {{finished}} as the highest run-getter for his team in the Inter-State T20 Championship with 179 runs <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 35.80. In July–August 2007, the India Under-19 team toured Sri Lanka.

Rhodes took 141 wickets in the season, <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 13.27. In the autumn, he travelled to India, coaching and playing for the Maharaja of Patiala's private team; Rhodes repeated this trip every year until 1927, sometimes accompanied by other players. On five occasions in India he completed a 1,000 runs and 100 wickets double, although most of these games were not first-class.|$|E

5|$|Marsh {{was never}} {{selected}} again, although {{he continued to}} dominate grade cricket. He was the leading wicket-taker for three consecutive seasons from 1901–02 to 1903–04, taking a total of 158 wickets <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 10.94.|$|E
5|$|Matters {{changed for}} Barber in the 1932 season, when Yorkshire's regular, long serving opening batsman Percy Holmes began to suffer with illness. This left a batting place empty and enabled Barber to play more regularly. Wisden Cricketer's Almanack {{believed}} that he thoroughly deserved {{his place in the}} team as he scored exactly 1,000 runs <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 25.64, the first time he reached four figures in a season. He finished fifth in the Yorkshire batting averages, {{the first time he had}} been placed so high. His runs also played a part in Yorkshire winning the County Championship in his first full season. After this breakthrough, Barber steadily improved his total of runs and batting average, helping Yorkshire to win the County Championship twice in 1933 and 1935. In 1933, he scored 1,595 runs <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 33.93, and in 1934 he scored 1,927 runs <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 40.14. In both seasons he finished fourth in the Yorkshire averages. However, Barber's best season statistically was the following season, 1935, when he achieved his best aggregate of runs and highest average in an English season, passing 2,000 runs in a season for the only time in his career. He scored 2,147 runs <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 42.09 and finished third in the Yorkshire averages. These performances earned him selection for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's Cricket Ground for the only time in his career, where he scored 61 and 18 not out.|$|E
