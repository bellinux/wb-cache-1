5|$|Four orthopoxviruses cause {{infection}} in humans: variola, vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox. Variola virus infects only humans in nature, although primates <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> {{have been infected}} in a laboratory setting. Vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox viruses can infect both humans <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> in nature.|$|E
5|$|Herbivores eat plants, but {{plants can}} defend {{themselves}} and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous. Other organisms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants. For example, mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia provide plants with nutrients {{in exchange for}} food, ants are recruited by ant plants to provide protection, honey bees, bats <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> pollinate flowers and humans <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> act as dispersal vectors to spread spores and seeds.|$|E

5|$|Alkaloids {{are derived}} from various amino acids. Over 3000 known {{alkaloids}} exist, examples include nicotine, caffeine, morphine, cocaine, colchicine, ergolines, strychnine, and quinine. Alkaloids have pharmacological effects on humans <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals.</b> Some alkaloids can inhibit or activate enzymes, or alter carbohydrate and fat storage by inhibiting the formation phosphodiester bonds involved in their breakdown. Certain alkaloids bind to nucleic acids and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect DNA repair mechanisms. Alkaloids can also affect cell membrane and cytoskeletal structure causing the cells to weaken, collapse, or leak, and can affect nerve transmission. Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> they almost uniformly invoke an aversively bitter taste.|$|E

5|$|Heilmann's {{book was}} divided into four main parts. The first three draw {{evidence}} for bird evolution from the fossil record, from the embryos of birds <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> and from living birds, respectively. The fourth and most groundbreaking section examines several groups of extinct animals {{in order to determine}} the probable root of modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Herons and egrets are {{medium to}} large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns {{tend to be}} shorter-necked and more secretive. They all fly with their necks retracted. The sharp bill is used to catch fish, {{amphibians}} <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals.</b> Many species nest in colonies, often in trees.|$|E
5|$|The Mesozoic era is {{represented}} in the park by the model rock exposure showing a succession of beds, namely the Jurassic and Cretaceous, by models of dinosaurs <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> known from mesozoic fossils, and by suitable vegetation - both living plants and models.|$|E

5|$|The major dietary lipids {{for humans}} <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> are {{animal and plant}} triglycerides, sterols, and {{membrane}} phospholipids.

5|$|The {{physiological}} {{similarities between}} humans <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> especially primates, {{have led to}} more comparative research between the two groups.

5|$|Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) {{was brought}} to Southern Florida as an {{ornamental}} shrub and was dispersed by the droppings of birds <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> that ate its bright red berries. It thrives on abandoned agricultural land growing in forests too dense for wading birds to nest in, similar to melaleucas. It grows rapidly especially after hurricanes and has invaded pineland forests. Following Hurricane Andrew, scientists and volunteers cleared damaged pinelands of Brazilian pepper so the native trees {{would be able to}} return to their natural state.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bumblebees}} {{are social}} insects that form colonies {{with a single}} queen. The colonies are smaller than those of honey bees, growing to as few as 50 individuals in a nest. Female bumblebees can sting repeatedly, but generally ignore humans <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals.</b> Cuckoo bumblebees do not make nests; their queens aggressively invade the nests of other bumblebee species, kill the resident queens and then lay their own eggs, which are cared for by the resident workers.|$|E
5|$|The Horse Project has an {{official}} website, which encourages participation, and offers instructions for tethering. The project accepts donations and volunteer support. Participants considered selling kits for consumers interested in tethering horses. One Portland resident has reportedly installed more than 150 horses. Horses {{are the most}} frequent animal to be tied to rings, but pigs, dolls, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> have also appeared throughout the city.|$|E

5|$|The Round Church {{featured}} {{marble and}} limestone cornices. These included {{a large number}} of intertwined ornaments and details, such as palmettes, grape clusters, leaves, and chamfers. Besides classic ornamental shapes, the cornices feature some that are entirely new in character or well-known yet redesigned motifs. Floral decoration dominates the cornices. Tiles found inside the church ruins depict birds <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> in addition to geometric shapes and floral motifs, all glazed in either brown, yellow, green, blue, or blue-green. The walls were covered in polished marble facing with encrusted shapes.|$|E
5|$|Ticks {{have four}} stages to their lifecycle, namely egg, larva, nymph, and adult. Ixodid ticks have three hosts, taking {{at least a}} year to {{complete}} their lifecycle. Argasid ticks have up to seven nymphal stages (instars), each one requiring a blood meal. Because of their habit of ingesting blood, ticks are vectors of at least twelve diseases that affect humans <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Urban sprawl, air {{and water}} pollution, noise, light pollution, {{and a range of}} habitat {{restricted}} by human infrastructure put stress on the park's mammals <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> but the most serious immediate threat to them is roadkill. About 50,000 vertebrates a year die on the park's roads when they are hit by a vehicle. The RMD has few roads, but Picture Rocks Road, an east–west commuter highway crossing the TMD, is highly dangerous to wildlife. Attempts in 2002 to convert it to a hiking trail failed after the proposal met with stiff public resistance.|$|E
