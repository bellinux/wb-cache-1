5|$|For centuries, the Somali community, {{as opposed}} to the state, has been in charge of Islamic {{education}} in all aspects, providing financial and <b>administrative</b> <b>support.</b> The majority of the schools are provided by the free market, sustained by school fees (typically $10 per month); in cases where there are state-supported public schools, private schools are often coveted for their academic excellence, outperforming their public competitors in academic achievement tests.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Walt and Roy Disney {{consulted}} with SRI (and in particular, Harrison Price) on their proposal for Disneyland in Burbank, California. SRI provided information on location, attendance patterns, and economic feasibility. SRI selected a larger site in Anaheim, prepared reports about operation, and provided on-site <b>administrative</b> <b>support,</b> and acted in an advisory {{role as the}} park expanded. In 1955, SRI was commissioned to select a site and provide design suggestions for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{problems}} that have affected the F-FDTL throughout its existence were caused by the process used to establish the force. A key flaw in this process was that FALINTIL's high command was allowed to select candidates for the military from members of FALINTIL without external oversight. As a result, the selection was conducted, to a large degree, on the basis of applicants' political allegiance. This led to many FALINTIL veterans feeling that they had been unfairly excluded from the military and reduced the force's public standing. Furthermore, UNTAET failed to establish adequate foundations for the East Timorese security sector by developing legislative and planning documents, <b>administrative</b> <b>support</b> arrangements and mechanisms for the democratic control of the military. These omissions remained uncorrected after East Timor achieved independence on 20 May 2002.|$|E

5|$|After this, No. 6 Commando was {{put into}} the role of mobile reserve in an effort to {{maintain}} the unit's integrity and spare it from incurring further losses that might render it unable to remain in the line. Nevertheless, throughout March and into April they continued to carry out patrol operations around Goubellat and Ben Arada. Finally, in early April {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the commandos from the fighting in North Africa. Lacking the <b>administrative</b> <b>support</b> and reinforcements of regular infantry units, the unit's strength had fallen to just 150 men and as a result it was no longer considered effective. On 7 April, No. 6 Commando arrived in Algiers, where it remained for two weeks before embarking on HMT Staffordshire on 24 April. After a short voyage, it arrived back in the United Kingdom on 2 May 1943 to begin preparations for the invasion of German-occupied France.|$|E

Between 1920 and 1922 he personally undertook much of the work associated with developing the Museum's first major exhibition, which opened in Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building on Anzac Day 1922.
