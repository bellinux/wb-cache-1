However, he was <b>already</b> <b>thinking</b> ahead to his television projects; and upon learning {{that the government would}} own his patents if he stayed in the military, he sought and received an honorable discharge within months, under a provision in which the eldest child in a fatherless family could be excused from military service in order to provide for his family. He returned to Provo and enrolled again at Brigham Young University, where he was allowed to take advanced science classes.|$|E
25|$|The Knights {{received}} Vytautas without enthusiasm. At {{the time}} Jogaila was {{negotiating with the}} Teutonic Order. On October 31, 1382, they formulated the Treaty of Dubysa in three separate acts. It was a reward for their help in defeating Andrei and Kęstutis. In it, Jogaila promised to accept Christianity within four years, become an ally of the Order, not to initiate a war without Order's approval, and cede Samogitia, which still supported Vytautas, up to the Dubysa River. However, ratification of the treaty was continuously put off. One {{of the reasons for}} the cooling relations was a war in Masovia, that Jogaila had started without consulting the Knights. The Knights also attempted to play Vytautas and Jogaila off against each other. Other historians suggest that Jogaila was <b>already</b> <b>thinking</b> about an alliance with either Moscow or Poland. Eventually, in June 1383, a scheduled meeting between Jogaila and the Grand Master did not take place on a formal pretext and the alliance broke down. The Knights resumed their war with Lithuania.|$|E

500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez was {{disappointed}} that his team were unable to match their exploits of 2005, when they beat Milan in a penalty shootout. Despite this he was still proud of his players efforts: [...] "Thank you to our supporters, my staff and players who worked really hard and deserved a bit more." [...] Benítez was <b>already</b> <b>thinking</b> of making transfers {{in the aftermath of}} the match, hinting that his team lacked the same calibre of players that Milan had: [...] "You could see the quality they had, and we need to start thinking how we can improve our team." ...|$|E

Her dissertation was on the structure of the antibiotic gramicidin. Thatcher did not devote herself entirely to studying chemistry as she only intended to be a chemist {{for a short period of}} time. Even when working on chemistry, she was <b>already</b> <b>thinking</b> towards law and politics. [...] She was reportedly more proud of becoming the first Prime Minister with a science degree than the first female Prime Minister, and as Prime Minister attempted to preserve Somerville as a women's college.|$|E
500|$|Geneforge 2 was {{developed}} in tandem with another Spiderweb Software title, Blades of Avernum. Developer Jeff Vogel described the game's production as [...] "very relaxing", since the game engine was already completed from the previous game he was familiar with it and therefore could devote his time to creating the game itself. Due to the different reactions the player receives from the factions, depending on their actions and conversation choices, it required days to complete a single town. This was further increased from the original game, due to there being four factions instead of three. In an interview held during the development of Geneforge 2 Vogel stated [...] "I'm really excited about the Geneforge series. And we're <b>already</b> <b>thinking</b> about Geneforge 3." [...] A 20 area demo version was released, allowing players access to towns, mines and woodlands.|$|E

2500|$|By 1845, Paris and {{the railway}} {{companies}} were <b>already</b> <b>thinking</b> about an urban railway system to link inner districts of the city. The railway {{companies and the}} French government wanted to extend main-line railroads into a new underground network, whereas the Parisians favoured a new and independent network and feared national takeover of any system it built. [...] The disagreement lasted from 1856 to 1890. Meanwhile, the population became more dense and traffic congestion grew massively. The deadlock {{put pressure on the}} authorities and gave the city the chance to enforce its vision.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the opinion}} of Glazer (1980, p.113), there is {{evidence}} that Zionist leaders were <b>already</b> <b>thinking</b> about removal of the Palestinian population before the actual occurrence. On 7 February 1948, Ben-Gurion told the Central Committee of Mapai (the largest Zionist political party in Palestine) [...] "it is most probable that in the 6, 8 or 10 coming months of the struggle many great changes will take place, very great in this country and not all of them to our disadvantage, and surely a great change in the composition of the population in the country." [...] Glazer (1980, p.113) states that the 1947 Partition Resolution awarded an area to the Jewish state whose population was 46 percent Arab and where much of this land was owned by Arabs. He considers that [...] "it has been argued by the Zionists that they were prepared to make special accommodations for this large population; yet {{it is difficult to see}} how such accommodations could have coalesced with their plans for large-scale Jewish immigration; moreover, by 1 August 1948, the Israeli government had already stated that it was 'economically unfeasible' to allow the return of the Arabs, at the very time when Jewish refugees were already entering the country and being settled on abandoned Arab property." ...|$|E

2500|$|The analogy he {{provides}} {{to explain his}} theory is that of wood and fire. Wood, he argues, is potentially hot (just as a human is potentially thinking about a universal), and therefore requires something else which is already hot (such as fire) to actualize this. This means that for the human intellect to think about something, the First Intellect must <b>already</b> be <b>thinking</b> about it. Therefore, {{he says that the}} First Intellect must always be thinking about everything. Once the human intellect comprehends a universal by this process, it becomes part of the individual's [...] "acquired intellect" [...] and can be thought about whenever he or she wishes.|$|R
