25|$|Before the Gold Rush of 1849 {{there were}} only a few hundred people living in tents and wooden shanties within San Francisco. However, after the gold rush the {{population}} of San Francisco would increase fifty-fold in just two years—from 492 in 1847 to over 25,000 in 1849. That quick and extreme growth combined with a lack of strong and robust government would create many opportunities for criminals, corrupt politicians, and brothel owners. For many decades murderers and robbers could commit their crimes without punishment, sometimes boldly in public view. As a result, the Barbary Coast became a wild <b>area</b> <b>representative</b> of the Old West, and had many problems with political corruption, gambling, crime, and violence.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the north}} of the region, some of the best known plants yield {{products}} of commercial value, such as rubber (Hevea brasiliensis), mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), balsam wood (Myroxylon balsamum), timber and essential oil (Amburana acreana), tagua nut (Phytelephas microcarpa), and strychnine (Strychnos asperula). An <b>area</b> <b>representative</b> of the southern part of this region, in {{the north of}} Bolivia, hosts a seasonal humid high forest to [...] with some emergents reaching [...] in height and many buttressed trunks. The largest trees are Ceiba pentandra, Poulsenia armata, Calycophyllum spruceanum, Swietenia macrophylla, and Dipteryx odorata. Other trees typical in this area are Calycophyllum acreanum, Terminalia amazonica, Combretum laxum, Mezilaurus itauba, Didymopanax morototoni, Jacaranda copaia, Aspidosperma megalocarpon, Vochisia vismiaefolia, Hirtella lightioides, and Hura crepitans. Palms include, among others, members of the genera Astrocaryum, Iriartea and Sheelea, Oenocarpus mapora, Chelyocarpus chuco, Phytelephas macrocarpa, Euterpe precatoria, and Jessenia bataua. Lianas are common with about 43 species present. Many Amazonian species reach the southern limit of their distribution here. The Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa) is present in the south, but is likely not native this far west in Amazonia.|$|E
2500|$|Peterman {{maintained}} his earlier position when the Terri Schiavo case was revisited in 2005. The Florida House again {{passed a bill}} to prevent the removal of [...] Schaivo's feeding tube. Peterman and Arthenia Joyner {{were two of the}} few Democrats who supported the bill. Most Republicans in the House had voted for it. Everett Rice and Leslie Waters were two Pinellas Republican representatives who voted against it. Waters was quoted as saying [...] "'Terri's family, Terri's doctors and clergy know best. Not people who have never met her.'" [...] That same year, the Legislature passed a Stand-your-ground law that had been strongly supported by the National Rifle Association. The law removed the a person's [...] "'duty to retreat'" [...] when attacked in a place outside the home they had a legal right to be, giving the individual [...] "'the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so, to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another.'" [...] Peterman was one of twenty state representatives, and the only Tampa Bay <b>Area</b> <b>representative</b> aside from Joyner, to oppose the bill, saying it would create a confrontational [...] "open season." ...|$|E

25|$|Authority was {{delegated}} {{to each of}} the counties under the auspices of local <b>area</b> <b>representatives.</b> Some of the <b>area</b> <b>representatives</b> soon came into conflict with the bowling centre proprietors, for example insisting on costly re-surfacing of lanes, which they argued was unnecessary. The proprietors rebelled and set up their own rival organisation, the Tenpin Bowling Proprietors Association (TBPA), in 1967. An Annual General Meeting of the BTBA saw this conflict rise to a head and most of the governing council resigned, leaving Glazer to regroup and bring back all decisions to the BTBA head office. It took several years to achieve a rapprochement with the proprietors.|$|R
