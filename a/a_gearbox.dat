5|$|In June, Oblivion {{suffered}} downtime {{owing to}} <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> component failing. The ride remained closed {{for a few}} weeks while a replacement part was manufactured. The ride re-opened on 25 June.|$|E
5|$|During the 1999 United States Road Racing Championship season, Hornish drove for Intersport Racing in the United States Road Racing Championship at the season-opening Rolex 24 at Daytona with Jon Field, Ryan Jones and Mike Shank in the Can-Am class. Their car, {{starting}} in eighth place, finished 42nd (14th in its class) after retiring on lap 400 with <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{transmission}} of the T-26 consisted of single-disc main dry clutch, <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> with five gears in the front part of the vehicle, steering clutches, final drives and band brakes. The gearbox {{was connected to the}} engine by a drive shaft passing through the vehicle. A gear change lever was mounted directly on the gearbox.|$|E
50|$|The B1 and B2 use <b>a</b> {{six-speed}} automatic <b>gearbox.</b> <b>A</b> six-speed manual <b>gearbox</b> allegedly was in development.|$|R
25|$|On some gearbox bicycles, {{the bottom}} bracket shell may be {{replaced}} by <b>an</b> integrated <b>gearbox</b> or <b>a</b> mounting location for <b>a</b> detachable <b>gearbox.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Figo is {{available}} with a 1.4 L petrol engine with <b>a</b> manual <b>gearbox</b> or <b>a</b> 1.6 L with <b>an</b> automatic <b>gearbox.</b> It {{is sold in}} Trend and Ambiente models.|$|R
5|$|At {{the back}} of the race, Bourdais began a slow climb back up the field. The Toro Rosso driver passed Sutil (who later spun out and retired with <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> problem), Nakajima and Coulthard, to sit in 15th by lap30. Rosberg fought Glock for 12th, until he passed the Toyota at the turn14 hairpin on lap12. Rosberg's pit stop relegated him to 18th, {{dropping}} six places. Kubica pitted late, on lap25, dropping from third to ninth, one position outside of the points.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} night race in Formula One, the , Webber {{qualified}} in 13th position. Red Bull pulled in both Webber and David Coulthard for their pit stops {{as soon as they}} could when the safety car came on track, due to Nelson Piquet, Jr. crashing, giving them both great track position. This led to Webber running in 2nd place before <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> issue put him out of the race on lap 29.|$|E
5|$|Coulthard and Button {{collided}} on lap18 when Button {{attempted to}} pass the Red Bull on the inside at turn eight; the Honda lost its front wing and retired a lap later after two pit stops. Hamilton continued his climb back through the field; he moved from 18th, passing Piquet, Davidson, Sutil and Bourdais in separate manoeuvres, to sit in 14th {{by the time he}} pitted on lap31. Piquet retired on lap42 with transmission failure, requiring <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> change before the next race.|$|E
50|$|Enzo Ferrari {{wanted the}} 125 S to use <b>a</b> {{five-speed}} <b>gearbox</b> as it matched the high revving V12 {{better than that}} of <b>a</b> traditional four-speed <b>gearbox.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Vanden Plas {{models were}} rebranded as the 1.5 and the 1.7, the 1.5 having a twin {{carburettor}} 1500 cc engine and <b>a</b> manual <b>gearbox,</b> while the 1.7 {{had a single}} carburettor 1750cc engine and <b>an</b> automatic <b>gearbox.</b>|$|R
50|$|The R25 {{was also}} the last Renault Formula One car to use <b>a</b> 6-speed <b>gearbox</b> before the switch to <b>a</b> {{mandatory}} 7-speed <b>gearbox</b> in the following season.|$|R
5|$|On {{the same}} lap Irvine overtook his {{teammate}} Herbert for tenth position. Wurz {{crashed into the}} barriers at turn 1 {{and was forced to}} retire. Gené retired on lap 22 with <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> issue as his teammate Mazzacane subsequently collided with the barriers at turn one on the same lap and had to retire from the event. Herbert became the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 27 although his pit crew came unprepared and Herbert was stationary for half a minute before he exited in 17th position. On the 31st lap, Diniz made contact with the barriers at turn one and he damaged his left rear wheel, causing him to retire. Häkkinen's pace was reduced by lap 36 as he slowed with an blockage on his brake pedal and made an unscheduled pit stop. His team's mechanics opened his car's inspection hatch and rearranged radio cables. They subsequently removed a data transmitter which was the cause the blockage and Häkkinen rejoined in 9th. Trulli became the next retirement of the race when he pulled {{to the side of the}} track with <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> problem on the following lap.|$|E
5|$|Webber {{took his}} only {{victory of the}} season at , taking the lead from {{teammate}} Vettel after he developed <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> issue. With this result, he moved into third place in the championship, ahead of Fernando Alonso. Webber also achieved his seventh fastest lap of the season at the race, with no other drivers scoring more than three in the season. This resulted in him winning the DHL Fastest Lap Award for the first time.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} laps, Massa {{appeared}} to have a faster car than Hamilton, and repeatedly tried to pass the McLaren {{on the inside of}} turn four. His first attempt was on lap three, but Hamilton braked late and kept ahead of Massa into the following corner. Massa tried again at the same place on the next two laps. He passed Hamilton briefly into the turn on lap five, but overshot the corner and ran wide onto the grass. He dropped to fifth, behind teammate Räikkönen and BMW's Nick Heidfeld. Hamilton apologised after the race for 'tricking' Massa into the move. Albers, in the sole remaining Spyker, retired on lap nine with <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> fire.|$|E
50|$|Power for the {{accessory}} drive {{is taken from}} the central shaft linking the turbine and compressor sections of the engine. This requires <b>an</b> internal <b>gearbox</b> that couples the drive to a radial driveshaft or towershaft that drives <b>an</b> external <b>gearbox.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It was {{available}} {{with a choice}} of <b>a</b> five-speed manual <b>gearbox,</b> <b>a</b> six-speed manual <b>gearbox,</b> only for the sporty 1.9-litre [...] diesel model, or with <b>a</b> four-speed automatic <b>gearbox,</b> used only in combination with the 1.4-litre [...] petrol engine. A six-speed semi-automatic transmission (Tiptronic) was added from mid-2006, after the facelift, also available only with the 1.4-litre [...] or with the 1.6-litre [...] petrol engines.|$|R
50|$|A {{production}} run of 209 South African 745i was built from 1983 to 1987, 192 {{of which were}} with <b>an</b> automatic <b>gearbox</b> and 17 with <b>a</b> 5-speed manual <b>gearbox.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hill {{represented}} Williams {{alone at}} the next race, the Monaco Grand Prix. His race ended early in a collision involving several cars on the opening lap of the race. For the following race, the Spanish Grand Prix, Williams' test driver David Coulthard was promoted to the race team alongside Hill, who won the race just four weeks after Senna's death. Twenty-six years earlier Graham Hill had won in Spain under similar circumstances for Lotus {{after the death of}} his team-mate Jim Clark. Championship leader Schumacher finished second with <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> fault restricting him to fifth gear, having led the early laps.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{led from}} the start, {{preventing}} Fernando Alonso from overtaking at turn one. Alonso ran wide allowing Nick Heidfeld to overtake him and move into second place. Alonso damaged his car {{in the process and}} subsequently ran off the track at turn one a further three times during the race. Jenson Button had <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> problem {{at the start of the}} race and was unable to select first gear causing him stall on the grid. Christijan Albers started from pit lane. The first accident of the race involved Scott Speed who clipped the rear wing of Wurz' Williams and went into the hairpin with a broken suspension.|$|E
5|$|Nico Rosberg {{topped the}} {{timesheets}} on Friday, {{ahead of the}} two Red Bull cars of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. The session started on a very wet track, but with no more rain falling, it dried out as the practice progressed, with drivers soon switching to intermediate tyres. Lewis Hamilton was fifth fastest, behind Carlos Sainz Jr.. Despite going off the track late in the session, Fernando Alonso was ninth fastest in the McLaren with the new power unit. <b>A</b> <b>gearbox</b> problem meant that Pastor Maldonado was unable {{to take to the}} track, while at Sauber, Raffaele Marciello replaced Felipe Nasr, ending the session three-tenths of a second quicker than teammate Marcus Ericsson.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> four-speed <b>gearbox</b> was fitted.|$|R
50|$|The CB250 G5 had <b>a</b> {{six-speed}} <b>gearbox.</b>|$|R
50|$|Preselector {{gearboxes}} are not automatic gearboxes, {{although they}} may have internal similarities. <b>A</b> fully automatic <b>gearbox</b> is able to select the ratio used; with <b>a</b> preselector <b>gearbox,</b> gear selection remains the driver's decision.|$|R
5|$|The race began {{behind the}} safety car due to rain {{shortly before the}} start. Hamilton was able to convert his pole {{position}} into a third straight victory at the British Grand Prix, leading home Rosberg and Verstappen in changing conditions. Rosberg came {{under investigation by the}} race stewards after he received detailed instructions by his team how to work around <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> problem in the closing laps of the race, a practice forbidden under Formula One regulations. He was later handed a ten-second time penalty, demoting him to third place. The result saw Rosberg's championship lead reduced to just a single point over Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|By lap ten, Hamilton {{had built}} a three-second lead over his {{teammate}} Rosberg, who was an additional 1.7 seconds ahead of Vettel. While some drivers came into the pit lane for their first regular stop as early as lap 13, the top runners stayed out until lap 37, when Vettel {{was the first to}} come in, followed by Rosberg and Hamilton one lap later respectively. Following the stops, Hamilton led Rosberg by seven seconds. Max Verstappen dropped down the order when a problem {{at the rear of the}} car caused him to be stationary for 31 seconds during his stop on lap 30. Fernando Alonso, who had been running in ninth place, retired from the race with <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> failure on lap 43. By lap 45, Hamilton had extended his lead to ten seconds, while Rosberg remained two seconds ahead of Sebastian Vettel.|$|E
5|$|Continuing with Jaguar in 2004, Webber {{qualified}} sixth for {{the first}} race of the season, the , but faced his second consecutive retirement from his home race, this time {{as a result of}} <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> failure. At the following race, the , Webber produced the best qualifying performance of his career up to that point by splitting the dominant Ferraris to line up second on the grid. The race was less rewarding with a near-stall at the start meaning he was well outside the top 10 by the time the cars reached turn 1. An aggressive lap saw him move up to ninth place but during an exciting battle with Ralf Schumacher, they collided, forcing Webber to pit with damage to his front wing and tyre. In his desperation {{to make up for the}} lost time, Webber exceeded the pitlane speed limit and was handed a drive-through penalty which left him even further behind. More frustration eventually led to the end of his race as he spun into the gravel trap on the outside of the final corner on lap 23.|$|E
50|$|When {{combined}} with <b>an</b> epicyclic <b>gearbox,</b> <b>a</b> pair of clutches could form <b>a</b> reversing <b>gearbox.</b> Engaging each clutch in turn provided a forwards and reverse motion, one direction being geared down in speed and increased in torque. As the clutches could be engaged quickly {{with only a}} light controlling force, these gearboxes became widely used in heavy steel rolling mills, where the rollers are driven forwards requiring full power, then quickly in reverse.|$|R
50|$|Optional {{equipment}} {{includes a}} central tyre inflation system, <b>a</b> fully automatic <b>gearbox,</b> <b>a</b> 10-tonne hydraulic self-recovery winch and a dozer blade.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} mated to <b>a</b> 4-speed <b>gearbox.</b>|$|R
5|$|Domenicali insisted {{there were}} no team orders {{and that it was}} Massa who chose to allow Alonso past. Alonso reaffirmed Domenicalli's {{statement}} and admitted he was surprised when Massa slowed and claimed that he felt Massa had <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> issue. FIA reporter Lars Osterlind investigated the incident and sent a 160-page report to the World Motor Sport Council which concluded that Alonso should be given a five-second time penalty which would hand the victory to Massa. He also wanted a suspended penalty on the loss of Ferrari's Drivers' and Constructors' points scored in the event. At the World Motor Sport Council meeting held in Paris on 8 September, the tribunal elected to uphold the $100,000 fine imposed on Ferrari, decided that no further action would be taken against the team, and that Formula One's Sporting Working Group would review the rule that prohibited team orders. In December, the FIA announced the rule on team orders would be revoked because it was difficult to enforce. Parallels were made between the race and the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix where Barrichello was ordered by Ferrari to concede the event's victory to Schumacher on its final lap.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{had a bad}} {{start from}} pole position, {{allowing}} Schumacher to overtake him into turnone. Panis, who started from tenthposition in a Ligier, spun at the firstcorner after a nudge from Katayama, hitting {{the wall in the}} process and retiring from the race. Herbert, racing the spare Benetton chassis, dropped three places by the end of lapone, dropping behind Häkkinen and the two Ferrari cars. Blundell also made a poor start, dropping to fourteenth position after his gearbox changed from first to third gear as he accelerated away from the grid. At {{the end of the first}} lap, the race order was Schumacher leading Hill, from Coulthard, Häkkinen, Berger, Alesi, Herbert, Irvine, Katayama and Salo, with the two Tyrrell drivers switching places on the next lap. At the start of lapthree, Hill attempted to overtake Schumacher heading into turnfive, but Schumacher closed the door on Hill. Hill lost the advantage for a moment, with teammate Coulthard drawing alongside, but unable to get past with Hill on the inside line into turnsix. Henceforth, Schumacher and Hill began to gradually pull away from Coulthard, who realised that he could not match the pace of the leaders and settled into his own rhythm, albeit one that was still comfortably faster than the cars behind him. By lapfive, Herbert had dropped down to tenthposition, unhappy with the handling of the spare car and having been overtaken by Irvine, Salo and Katayama. On lapten, Schumacher lapped last-placed Diniz for the first time; the presence of slower cars a constant factor for the front-runners thereafter. On the same lap Frentzen retired from 12thposition with electrical failure. He was joined by Schiattarella two laps later after his Simtek car developed a steering problem. Irvine made a pit stop earlier than expected on lapfifteen, retiring from the race with <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> actuator problem. On the same lap, Katayama spun at the fourthcorner, stalled his car in the process and retired from the race. The two retirements meant Herbert moved back up to eighth position. Alesi was the first of the leading drivers to make a scheduled pit stop on lap17, rejoining the track in eleventh place. Barrichello, Irvine's teammate, retired a lap later, driving into the pit lane slowly with <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> problem. On the same lap, Verstappen retired his Simtek car with a clutch problem.|$|E
5|$|On lap 37, Trulli and Nico Rosberg were {{battling for}} {{position}} going into turn 1. Both span {{off the track}} in almost synchronised fashion without touching each other. This occurrence amused reporters due to it resembling a form of dance. Both drivers were able to keep going. Also on this lap Anthony Davidson made an unscheduled pit stop. He claimed after the race that a beaver had damaged his front wing although Canadian reports said it {{more likely to have}} been a groundhog. One lap later David Coulthard was forced to retire due to <b>a</b> <b>gearbox</b> problem. Ralf Schumacher also stopped on this lap and this allowed Massa, Fisichella and Sato to move ahead of both of them. Räikkönen had his second pit stop on lap 52 at the same time as Alonso. The latter was able to pass him just after they had exited the pits side-by-side. This moved him into 5th.|$|E
50|$|In the Middle East, the RAV4 is {{available}} with a 2.4-liter engine. Most markets, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), get the all-wheel-drive model with <b>an</b> automatic <b>gearbox,</b> but KSA additionally gets a two-wheel-drive model as well, the base one with <b>a</b> manual <b>gearbox.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{engine is}} coupled {{to either a}} single speed E50 or a two speed ZA50 transmission. The {{versions}} of the transmissions can be identified by {{the shape of the}} gearboxes: The E50 has <b>a</b> round <b>gearbox</b> whereas the two speed has <b>a</b> rectangular <b>gearbox.</b> Both transmissions use a centrifugal clutch.|$|R
