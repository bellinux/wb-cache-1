40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{a simple}} and {{effective}} <b>dual</b> <b>channel</b> speech enhancement algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm incorporates a novelty filter scheme, performing associative memory and aiming at improving {{the performance of the}} <b>dual</b> <b>channel</b> Generalized Sidelobe Canceller (GSC.) The novelty filter is demonstrated as effective for enhancing the reference noise used in the <b>dual</b> <b>channel</b> GSC, such that the assumptions required for adaptive noise cancellation are satisfied. In this paper, the concept of a novelty filter scheme is described, in addition to the conditions required to guarantee the performance of the <b>dual</b> <b>channel</b> GSC and the method of applying the novelty filter scheme to speech enhancement objectives. In representative experiments, superiority of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using three objective measures; segmental Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Log Spectral Distance (LSD) and word accuracy, which are evaluated via speech data recorded in real automobile environments...|$|R

However, this paper finds that the channel structure in the distribution {{plays an important role}} in these performances. The results show that at least one of the <b>dual</b> <b>channels</b> should be centralised in order to outperform the single centralised channel and two decentralised channels always do better than one single decentralised <b>channel.</b> single channels; <b>dual</b> channels; capacity; supplier profit; channel structure; distribution channels; centralised channels; decentralised channels; product distribution. ...|$|R
