40|$|The dissociative {{adsorption}} {{of three}} carboxylic acids (acetic acid, propanoic acid, and acrylic acid), allyl alcohol, and <b>allyl</b> <b>aldehyde</b> on Si(100) 2 × 1 {{at room temperature}} has been investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD), as well as density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. The C 1 s features obtained by XPS measurement for acetic acid, propanoic acid, and acrylic acid show that formation of bidentate carboxylate at a low exposure is followed by that of unidentate carboxylate at a higher exposure, with approximately equal population for both adstructures. The signatures of C 1 s features attributed to methyl (285. 7 eV), ethyl (285. 3 eV), ethenyl (285. 0 eV), and bidentate carboxyl (286. 8 eV) and unidentate carboxyl (289. 8 - 289. 3 eV) carbons were observed for the studied carboxylic acids. The {{results showed that the}} carboxyl group is more reactive than the alkyl or alkenyl group towards the Si(100) 2 × 1 surface, with O−H dissociation preferred over [2 + 2] C=C cycloaddition and the other plausible reaction products. This was also supported by our DFT calculation which showed that the bidentate carboxylate adstructure is the most stable configuration among the calculated adstructures for the aforementioned carboxylic acids. The combined temperature-dependent XPS and TPD studies provided strong evidence for the formation of ketene, acetaldehyde and CO from acetic acid, CO and ethylene from propanoic acid, and CO, ethylene, acetylene, and propene from acrylic acid. Furthermore, the TPD results provided further evidence for the preferred structure of the adsorbate from each of the carboxylic acid on the surface. In addition to carboxyl group, reactivity of the hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups relative to that of ethenyl group was studied by investigating the reaction of allyl alcohol and <b>allyl</b> <b>aldehyde</b> on Si(100) 2 × 1 at room temperature. The C 1 s XPS results supported O−H dissociation for allyl alcohol and [2 + 2] C=O cycloaddition for <b>allyl</b> <b>aldehyde</b> over the [2 + 2] C=C cycloaddition. The similarity between the observed C 1 s features for allyl alcohol and <b>allyl</b> <b>aldehyde</b> helped to identify the structure of the adsorption products of these two molecules on the surface. The presence of the related C 1 s feature of C=C for allyl alcohol and <b>allyl</b> <b>aldehyde,</b> and the absence of C 1 s feature of C=O for <b>allyl</b> <b>aldehyde</b> provided strong evidence to support that [2 + 2] C=C cycloaddition does not occur in the presence of hydroxyl or carbonyl groups. Furthermore, by comparing the experimental results and the adsorption energies of the adstructures calculated by DFT, it was concluded that these molecules do not react with the Si dimers through both of their functional groups, while the reaction of only one of the two functional groups is preferred on the surface. Formation of ethylene, acetylene, and propene from allyl alcohol and <b>allyl</b> <b>aldehyde,</b> simultaneously to CO from allyl alcohol, was concluded from the corresponding TPD results, which also confirm the structure of the adsorbates on the surface. The present research shows that reactions involving oxygen-containing functional groups are favoured over the other plausible reactions including [2 + 2] C=C cycloaddition on the Si(100) 2 × 1. The preference of the surface to react with one of the two functional groups calls for future studies for the selective functionalization of Si(100) 2 × 1 with potential applications in molecular electronics...|$|E
40|$|The {{quantitative}} analysis method for volatile impurities in diallyldimethylammonium chloride (DADMAC) monomer solution {{was established in}} this paper. The volatile impurities were quantitatively analyzed with trichloromethane as extraction solvent and n-hexane as internal standard by using gas chromatography (GC) coupled with solvent extraction, and the chromatographic conditions, quantitative methods, and extraction conditions were systematically investigated in detail. The results showed that excellent linear relationships of 5 volatile impurities (dimethylamine, allyldimethylamine, allyl chloride, allyl alcohol, and <b>allyl</b> <b>aldehyde)</b> were obtained {{in the range of}} 1 – 100 [*]mg·L− 1. The method also showed good specificity, recovery (95. 0 %– 107. 5 %), and relative standard deviation (RSD, 1. 40 %– 7. 67 %). This method could accurately detect the whole volatile impurities in DADMAC monomer solution quantitatively in one time with a low detection limit. Furthermore, this method is conducive to the preparation of highly pure DADMAC monomer and the development of national and international standards of the DADMAC monomer product quality, and the results could provide a strong foundation for the regulation and mechanism research of impurities on monomer reactivity in polymerization...|$|E
40|$|The regio- and diastereoselectivity in the {{coupling}} of $ gamma$-substituted allylic bromides with aldehydes mediated by indium in water were examined {{and found to}} be dependent on the steric effect of the substituents on both the allylic bromides and the aldehydes. Despite the efficiency with which indium mediates carbon-carbon bond formation between <b>allyl</b> halides and <b>aldehydes</b> in an aqueous environment, it is not without short-comings. Nitro-functionalised aldehydes were found to be susceptible to the reductive conditions of this aqueous indium Barbier-Type reaction. In this connection, bismuth was found to chemoselectively mediate {{the coupling}} of <b>allyl</b> halides with <b>aldehydes</b> in water in the presence of tetrabutylammonium halides. The indium Barbier reaction in an aqueous medium was extended to include propargylic bromides. The coupling of aldehydes with propargylic bromides gave regioselectively either the homopropargyl alcohol or the $ alpha$-allenic alcohol depending on the $ gamma$-substituent of the propargylic bromides. The regio- and stereochemical course of the indium-promoted coupling of $ gamma$-substituted allylic halides with aldoses (water soluble carbohydrates) has been investigated. The stereoselective generation of two new contiguous stereogenic centres has been applied to the synthesis of novel 2 -substituted carbohydrates. The stereoselectivity of the reaction was explained on the basis of chelation of the allyl indium species with the $ alpha$-hydroxycarbonyl function. This gives syn selectivity for the $ rm C gamma$-$ rm C beta$ diol function in the product. The relative stereochemistry of the $ rm C beta$-$ rm C alpha$ linkage in the product is governed by the preferred geometry of the allyl indium species...|$|R
40|$|Two {{processes}} are described for improving reaction rates for relatively hydrophobic substrates in aqueous biphasic systems. In the first, 1 -octyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bromide ([Octmim]Br) increases {{the rate of}} hydroformylation of 1 -octene from 8 % conversion in 24 h to full conversion of 1. 5 h. Phase separation is fast and catalyst retention is good. 1 -Hexyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bromide gives little rate enhancement, whilst 1 -decyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bromide gives stable emulsions., The mechanism of action of these additives is discussed. In the second approach, functionalising PPh 3 with amidine groups allows the rhodium catalysed hydroformylation of 1 -octene in toluene with a very high reaction rate. The catalyst can be switched between toluene and water by bubbling CO 2 and back into toluene by bubbling N 2 at 60 °C. This switching {{has been used to}} separate the catalyst from hydrophobic (from 1 -octene) or hydrophilic (from <b>allyl</b> alcohol) <b>aldehydes</b> obtained from hydroformylation reactions. CO 2 expanded liquids {{have been shown to be}} effective media for transporting substrates and catalysts over supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysts. The advantages offered over all gas phase and liquid phase catalysts are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{enantioselective}} aryl {{transfer to}} aldehydes and imines using {{different types of}} aryl sources was developed within this PhD thesis. The new methods allow access to highly substituted Diarylmethanols, which are not accessible via the existing reductive protocols or the enantioselective phenyl transfer, respectively. The used aryl sources triphenylborane and arylboronic acids are much easier accessible and cheaper than the classical aryl source diphenylzinc. Additionally, a proper combination of arylboronic acid and aryl aldehyde gives access to both enantiomers of a specific product with the same catalyst, giving a versatile alternative to the laborious synthesis of ligand antipodes. The developed technique was furthermore extendet to various substrates, showing promising results in the aryl transfer to b-lactams, and in the <b>allyl</b> transfer to <b>aldehydes.</b> A further topic deals with the theoretical investigation of the aryl transfer to aldehydes on DFT level, gaining {{an understanding of the}} chemo- and stereoselectiveness of the prozess by modelling and comparing different transition states with a small model system...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of oxidn. of allyl and crotyl alcs. by sodium N-chlorobenzenesulfonamide or chloramine B (CAB) {{in presence}} of hydrochloric acid (0. 06 - 0. 26 M) {{has been studied}} at 0 Â°. The rate of reaction is first order in [CAB], independent of substrate concn. and is first order {{with respect to the}} gross concn. of HCl (0. 06 - 0. 12 M), which changes to second order at higher acidities (0. 15 - 0. 26 M). Chloride ion catalyzes the oxidn. Ionic strength and addn. of the reaction product, benzenesulfonamide, have negligible influence on the rate. The effect of changes in dielec. const. of the medium on the reaction rate has been studied. Activation parameters for the reaction have been calcd. H 2 OCl+ interacts with the alcs. forming a chloronium complex which loses a proton giving a hypochlorite which undergoes proton abstraction to form the conjugated. oxidn. products <b>allyl</b> and crotyl <b>aldehydes.</b> [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|R
40|$|The stereochemical {{course of}} the allylation and propargylation of several {{aldehydes}} with crotyl and propargyl halides using zinc powder as the condensing agent in cosolvent/water(salt) media have been extensively studied. Radical ions of well-defined geometry such as [CH 2 =CHCH(CH 3) Br](. -) {{are thought to be}} formed through an electron-transfer process, which seems to be accelerated by the high interfacial energy developed by the water. These radicals are trapped by the aldehyde molecules to form isomeric mixtures of threo/erythro-beta-methylhomoallylic alcohols or alpha-allenic/beta-acetylenic alcohols. The stereochemistry seems to be determined by the structure of the radical anions adsorbed on the zinc particles and is independent of the geometry of the organic halides, the cosolvents, or the salts. Reactions performed in the presence of Bu(3) SnCl show no discrimination between the coupling reactions of the <b>allyl</b> bromide with <b>aldehydes</b> and with Bu(3) SnCl, both homoallylic alcohols and allyltributylstannanes being formed. In contrast, in the presence of Bu(2) SnCl, only beta-methylhomoallylic alcohols are formed, this being a function of the differential allylstannation of aldehydes and crotyldibutyltin halides, which are intermediate products of the zinc-mediated process. The zinc-mediated method gives satisfactory results with acetals if workup is made under the catalytic mediation of Bu(2) SnCl(2) ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Both {{environmental}} and occupational exposure limits {{are based on}} the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL), lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) or benchmark dose (BMD) deriving from epidemiological and experimental studies. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate to what extent the NOAEL values for organic compounds responsible for liver toxicity calculated based on their physicochemical properties could be used for calculating occupational exposure limits. Material and Methods: The distribution coefficients from air to the liver (log Kliver) were calculated according to the Abraham solvation equation. NOAEL and LOAEL values for early effects in the liver were obtained from the literature data. The descriptors for Abraham's equation were found for 59 compounds, which were divided into 2 groups: "non-reactive" (alcohols, ketones, esters, ethers, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, amides) and "possibly reactive" (<b>aldehydes,</b> <b>allyl</b> compounds, amines, benzyl halides, halogenated hydrocarbons, acrylates). Results: The correlation coefficients between log-log K and log NOAEL for non-reactive and reactive compounds amounted to r = - 0. 8123 and r = - 0. 8045, respectively, and were statistically significant. It appears that the Abraham equation could be used to predict the NOAEL values for compounds lacking information concerning their liver toxicity. Conclusions: In view of the tendency to limit animal testing procedures, the method proposed in this paper can improve the practice of setting exposure guidelines for the unstudied compounds...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} and catalytic {{applications of}} a new aryl-based unsymmetrical PCS-pincer complex are reported. Preparation of the robust air- and moisture-stable PCS-pincer palladium complex 5 [X] started from the symmetrical,-dibromo-meta-xylene and involved the selective substitution of one bromide by PPh 2 (BH 3), followed by substitution of the second bromide by SPh and subsequent introduction of the palladium. The new PCS complexes (5 [X]) were employed as catalysts in two important organic transformations. Firstly, complex 5 [Cl] displays high catalytic activity in aldol reactions but enters the catalytic cycle as a precatalyst. Secondly, complex 5 [BF 4] displays tandem catalytic activity in the coupling of <b>allyl</b> chlorides with <b>aldehydes</b> and imines {{in the presence of}} hexamethylditin. In these tandem catalytic reactions the first process is the conversion of allyl chlorides into trimethylallyltin (and trimethyltin chloride) with Sn 2 Me 6, which is followed by catalytic allylation of aldehyde and sulfonimine substrates. In addition, we present a new catalytic process for the one-pot allylation of 4 -nitrobenzaldehyde with vinyloxirane. The catalytic performance of the novel PCS-pincer palladium complex was compared to those of its symmetrical PCP- and SCS-pincer complex analogues. It was concluded that the unsymmetrical PCS complex advantageously unifies the attractive catalytic features of the corresponding symmetrical pincer complexes including both (π-) electron-withdrawing (such as phosphorus) or (σ-) electron-donating (such as sulfur and nitrogen) heteroatoms. Thus, in the aldol reaction the PCS-pincer palladium complex 5 [X] provides a high turnover frequency, while in the tandem process both reactions are catalysed with sufficiently high activity...|$|R
40|$|Part A: Synthesis of 5 - and 6 -Membered Camphor-Based Hydrazides as Organocatalysts for Cycloaddition Reactions The {{favorable}} {{environmental and}} reactivity qualities of organocatalysts {{are contributing to}} the popularization of this method for the acceleration of enantioselective reactions. Research in our group {{has been focused on}} the synthesis of camphor-derived hydrazide based organocatalysts for enantioselective cycloaddition processes. Recent results suggest that the presence of an exocyclic electron withdrawing group on the hydrazide moiety, as well as the incorporation of the hydrazide moiety into a 6 -membered ring, may have a beneficial effect on the kinetics of the catalysts. A variety of camphor-based cyclic hydrazides have been synthesized and tested in Diels-Alder reactions, varying both the ring size and placement of the electron withdrawing group. Part B: Synthesis of Isocampholenic Acids by the Rearrangement of Camphor Derivatives	 A variety of substituted isocampholenic acid derivatives have been prepared by rearrangement of the camphor skeleton of a variety of tertiary alcohols derived from ketopinic acid. The reaction is highly reliable and retains the stereochemical information from the camphor scaffold. This rearrangement represents an efficient way to prepare synthetically useful isocampholenic acids. Mechanistic experiments show that the rearrangement does not involve exogenous water and that a short-lived carbocation is implicated in the reaction. Part C: Diastereoselective Formation of Quaternary Centers from Stereodefined Trisubstituted Alkenes Previous work in our laboratory has focused on the preparation of single-isomer tri- and tetra-substituted olefins. This methodology has been used in the construction of a variety of alkenyl esters in good to excellent yields. These alkenyl esters could then be transformed into the corresponding 3, 3 -disubstituted allyl boronates in a stereocontrolled fashion. There are a limited number of methods available to prepare single isomer 3, 3 -disubstituted allyl boronates, which can be important precursors in the stereoselective preparation of all-carbon quaternary centers. Our methodology has therefore been applied to the construction of single isomer 3, 3 -disubstituted allyl boronates and subsequently used in the stereoselective generation of all-carbon quaternary centers by the reaction of these <b>allyl</b> boronates with <b>aldehydes...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} broadly {{the applications}} of molecularly imprinted polymers in sensors and solid phase extraction. Sensors for creatine and creatinine {{have been reported}} using a novel method of rational design of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), and solid phase extraction of aflatoxin-B 1 has also been described in the thesis. A method for the selective detection of creataine and creatinine is reported in this thesis, {{which is based on}} the reaction between polymerised hemithioacetal, formed by <b>allyl</b> mercaptan, o-phthalic <b>aldehyde,</b> and primary amine leading to the formation of fluorescent isoindole complex. This method was demonstrated for the detection of creatine using creatine-imprinted MIPs. Since MIPs created using traditional methods were unable to differentiate between creatine and creatinine, a new approach to the rational design of a MIP selective for creatinine was developed using computer simulation. A virtual library of functional monomers was assigned and screened against the target molecule, creatinine, using molecular modeling software. The monomers giving the highest binding score were further tested using simulated annealing in order to mimic the complexation of the functional monomers with template in the monomer mixture. The result of this simulation gave an optimised MIP composition. The computationally designed polymer demonstrated superior selectivity in comparison to the polymer prepared using traditional approach, a detection limit of 25 μM and good stability. The 'Bite-and- Switch' approach combined with molecular imprinting can be used for the design of assays and sensors, selective for amino containing substances. MEP for the selective binding properties for aflatoxin-B 1 was prepared using the computational approach. The results obtained demonstrate that the MISPE offers a simple, convenient and a rapid methodology for solid phase extraction of aflatoxin-B 1 even at very low concentrations of 2 ppb. The commercially available C- 18 cartridges were able to recover only about 52 % of aflatoxin-B 1 at concentrations of 2 ppb when compared with almost complete recovery by the MIP. We have proved here that, MIPs as a solid phase extraction materials offer important and practical advantages with respect to other solid phase extraction methodologies...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 In {{previous}} work (Blakemore et al. Org. Lett. 2005, 7, 4721; Heterocycles 2006, 70, 609), successful elaborations of the lupine alkaloids (±) -α-isosparteine (dl- 2) and (±) -β-isosparteine (dl- 3) were realized {{from a common}} tetraoxobispidine precursor, 3, 7 -diallyl - 2, 4, 6, 8 -tetraoxo- 3, 7 -diazabicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonane (93). Herein, the tetraoxobispidine approach to lupine alkaloids was extended to a total synthesis of (±) -sparteine (dl- 1), a second generation improved route to (±) -βisosparteine (dl- 3) was established, and various novel synthetic manipulations of tetraoxobispidines were evaluated. The pivotal intermediate (93) was prepared in an optimized 16 % overall yield (c. f. 9 % previously reported) from dimethyl malonate and paraformaldehyde via acid-promoted cyclization of the Knoevenagel condensation adduct 1, 1, 3, 3 -propanetetracarboxamide (107), followed by N,N ́-diallylation of the resulting 2, 4, 6, 8 -tetraoxo- 3, 7 diazabicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonane (108). Bisimide 93 was advanced to (±) -sparteine (dl 1) in 12 % overall yield via six operations: (a) monoreduction of the bisimide (93) with sodium borohydride, (b) Sakarai-type allylation of the hemiaminal (97), (c) nucleophilic addition of allylmagnesium bromide to the remaining imide (98), (d) double ring-closing olefin metathesis of the resulting tetraenyl bicyclic hydroxybislactam (104) to yield a tetracyclic diene intermediate (126), (e) hydrogenation of alkene moieties, and finally, (f) exhaustive reduction with lithium aluminum hydride. It was discovered that the sodium borohydride reduction [step (a) ] also gave a C 2 -symmetric bishemiaminal (116) as a minor byproduct: double Sakarai-type allylation of this compound generated a tetraenylbislactam intermediate (100) identical to that employed in the original synthesis of (±) -β-isosparteine. As such, the tetraoxobispidine route to (±) -βisosparteine was effectively shortened to just five net steps from bisimide 93 (c. f. seven steps previously). A variety of known methods for the enantioselective addition of hydride and <b>allyl</b> nucleophiles to <b>aldehydes</b> were applied to C 2 Vsymmetric bisimide 93 {{in an attempt to}} realize an efficient asymmetric synthesis of sparteine alkaloids. None of the methods investigated, which included Keck allylation and Noyori transfer hydrogenation, gave any trace of addition adducts, reflecting the comparatively low intrinsic reactivity of imides. Finally, the reduction of N,N ́-dibenzyltetraoxobispidine (149) to N,N ́-dibenzylbispidine (150) was realized in 25 % yield using sodium bis(methoxyethoxy) aluminum hydride (Red-Al). It was therefore established that tetraoxobispidines unsubstituted on the methylene bridge are viable precursors to potentially useful biologically active bispidines...|$|R
