40|$|Renal {{pathology}} {{associated with}} haemoglobinaemia resulting from Babesia canis infection is ascribed to haemoglobinuria, {{with or without}} a contribution from <b>anaemic</b> <b>hypoxia.</b> This study was undertaken to investigate the relative roles of haemoglobinaemia and hypoxia in renal function and pathology in the dog. Three groups of 6 dogs each were used over a 4 -day period. The dogs in the 1 st group were infused with homologous canine haemoglobin, <b>anaemic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> was induced in the 2 nd group, and both treatments were applied in the 3 rd group. Full urinalyses, serum urea and creatinine concentrations, fractional clearance of sodium and the activity of urine enzymes, were assessed daily. At the end of the trial period, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was determined and kidney specimens collected for light and electron microscopy. In the group with hypoxia only, the urine sediment contained more casts and a greater number of renal tubular epithelial (RTE) cells than in either of the other groups. Hypoxia resulted in greater enzymuria, suggestive of RTE cell pathology, whereas haemoglobinuria did not appear to have any effect on urine enzyme activity. Hypoxia resulted in a decreased GFR. Histological examination revealed a mild, single-cell tubular necrosis in the majority of the animals (all 3 groups), with granular casts in the hypoxic groups. There appeared to be a large individual variation in the ability of the kidney to handle infused haemoglobin. It was concluded that severe haemoglobinaemia did not induce a significant nephropathy, <b>anaemic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> appeared to cause a very mild nephropathy, and the combination of haemoglobinaemia and <b>anaemic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> did not exacerbate this change. These lesions were very different from those described in canine babesiosis...|$|E
40|$|Intramucosal-to-arterial {{carbon dioxide}} {{difference}} (the so-called PCO 2 [partial carbon dioxide tension] gap) remains largely unaltered during decreased oxygen delivery, {{if the latter}} is reduced as flow is maintained. In this condition (hypoxic hypoxia or <b>anaemic</b> <b>hypoxia),</b> the PCO 2 gap fails to mirror intestinal tissue dysoxia. Results from several experiments have demonstrated that blood flow is the main determinant of PCO 2 gap. Gastrointestinal tonometry is clearly a useful indirect method for monitoring perfusion, but it has rather limited value in detecting anaerobic metabolism when blood flow is preserved. These considerations render it very unlikely that PCO 2 may dramatically increase (or that intramucosal pH may decrease) in any hypoxic state with preserved flow...|$|E
30|$|Tumour hypoxia is a {{consequence}} of imbalance between oxygen consumption and supply [5] due to factors mostly related to perfusion, diffusion or anaemia. Briefly, perfusion-related acute (also known as cyclic [6]) hypoxia is caused by limited oxygen delivery to the tissue due to fluctuations in blood flow as {{a consequence}} of poor tumour microvasculature. Acute hypoxia often fluctuates with cycle times that range from a few cycles per hour to many hours or days. Diffusion-related chronic hypoxia is caused by an increase in diffusion distances of oxygen from isolated blood vessels leading to inadequate oxygen supply which lasts from a few hours to many days. The spatial characteristics of cycling hypoxia commonly involve networks of microvessels as opposed to isolated blood vessels. <b>Anaemic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> is tumour-associated or therapy-induced due to reduction in oxygen transport capacity of blood which is exacerbated by the presence of low perfusion. An arterial blood partial pressure (pO 2) less than 80 Â mmHg is considered hypoxemic hypoxia [7].|$|E
40|$|Iron {{overload}} is {{a serious}} complication of many forms of anaemia, arising in part from mechanisms associated with compensatory increases in erythropoiesis. To investigate other mechanisms by which anaemia itself may perturb iron metabolism, without the confounding effects of compensatory erythropoiesis, we studied transgenic mice with a partially disabling insertion in the erythropoietin gene, which manifested as incomplete erythropoietin deficiency. Mice were studied aged 7 - 8 weeks. Haemoglobin concentrations were 6. 6 +/- 0. 8 g/dl in mice homozygous for the modified erythropoietin gene, 12. 9 +/- 2. 2 g/dl in heterozygous mice and 14. 1 +/- 1. 0 g/dl in controls. Homozygous mice showed significant hepatic iron loading (2 -fold increase in liver non-haem iron, compared with heterozygous mice and normal controls, with iron staining principally in the periportal hepatocytes). Absorption studies using 59 Fe showed increased uptake from the lumen of an in vivo isolated duodenal segment in homozygous mice, although {{at this point in}} time overall transfer of radioiron to the circulation and other tissues (mucosal transfer) was not different from controls. These observations demonstrate that anaemia can lead to hepatic iron loading even in the absence of increased erythropoiesis, and are consistent with the possibility that <b>anaemic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> can enhance mucosal iron uptake by the duodenal enterocyte...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecently a {{new class}} of {{calibrated}} blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods were introduced to quantitatively measure the baseline oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). These methods rely on two respiratory challenges and a mathematical model of the resultant changes in the BOLD functional MRI signal to estimate the OEF. However, this mathematical model does not include all of the effects that contribute to the BOLD signal, it relies on several physiological assumptions and it may be affected by intersubject physiological variability. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate these sources of systematic error and their effect on estimating the OEF. This was achieved through simulation using a detailed model of the BOLD signal. Large ranges for intersubject variability in baseline physiological parameters such as haematocrit and cerebral blood volume were considered. Despite this the uncertainty in the relationship between the measured BOLD signals and the OEF was relatively low. Investigations of the physiological assumptions that underlie the mathematical model revealed that OEF measurements are likely to be overestimated if oxygen metabolism changes during hypercapnia or cerebral blood flow changes under hyperoxia. Hypoxic hypoxia was predicted to result in an underestimation of the OEF, whilst <b>anaemic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> was found to have only a minimal effect...|$|E

40|$|The {{long-term}} behavioural {{effects of}} prenatal chronic <b>anaemic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> were investigated in young (5 months old), late adult (19 months) and aged Wistar rats (23 - 26 months). Sodium nitrite (2 g/l) {{offered in the}} drinking water {{during the second half}} of pregnancy served to evoke prenatal hypoxia. In parallel to nitrite treatment the Ca 2 + channel blocker nimodipine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle alone was administered intragastrically once daily. Open-field activity, intermale social behaviour, learning ability in a black-white discrimination paradigm and fear-induced emotionality were assessed at different ages. Plasma corticosterone response to novelty stress was measured by blood sampling through chronic venous canulas at the age of 28 months. The nitrite-exposed 5 -month-old offspring started exploration in a novel open-field with considerable delay. This delayed start-latency was augmented in 19 - and 23 -month-old rats, pointing to exaggerated suppression of behavioural arousal. Nitrite-induced hypoxia decreased the duration of social interactions during ageing. Aged rats exposed to nitrite were unable to learn a black-white discrimination but showed a normal generalized conditioned fear response (immobility) to the test situation as a whole. The conditioned fear-induced vocalization was more frequent among hypoxic aged animals. The aged hypoxic rats displayed a prolonged plasma corticosterone stress response and had higher adrenal weight than their controls. The abnormal open-field, social, learning and emotional behaviours, as well as the altered plasma corticosterone response, were prevented by prenatal nimodipine treatment...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{showed that}} dogs with natural {{infection}} with B. canis had both renal and cardiac dysfunction, {{both of which}} can be classified as complications of babesiosis and would thus necessitate supportive therapy. This thesis demonstrated that RTE celluria, proteinuria, and variable enzymuria and azotaemia occur in dogs with babesiosis. However, these were all minimal changes and all could be consistent with hypoxia, reduced GFR, or reduced cardiac output This thesis showed that dogs with naturally occurring babesiosis had significant urine met-haemoglobin with no evidence of blood met-haemoglobin. The possibility would be that the urinary methaemoglobin was either produced in the kidney or possibly by oxidation of haemoglobin to met-haemoglobin in the bladder. It has been shown experimentally that met-haemoglobin can be toxic. The combination of reduced GFR, <b>anaemic</b> <b>hypoxia,</b> and met-haemoglobin can all act synergistically to cause renal damage. Renal haemodynamics are also {{much more likely to be}} abnormal when cardiac dysfunction is present Reduced renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are evidence of redistribution of blood flow that commonly occurs in early heart failure. An important finding in this thesis was that dogs with babesiosis had lower serum sodium than control dogs but there was no difference between mild, severe, or complicated cases of babesiosis. In addition, dogs with babesiosis had a lower fractional clearance of sodium than Clinically healthy control dogs, which can be interpreted as sodium retention by the kidneys. This sodium retention would also result in water retention, which will result in an expansion of the plasma volume. In the past heart lesions in canine babesiosis were regarded as rare complications, with the majority of lesions being reported as incidental findings at post-mortem examination of complicated babesiosis cases. This thesis has demonstrated that cardiac lesions to be common in canine babesiosis. This thesis showed that that ECG changes in babesiosis were similar to the pattern described for myocarditis and myocardial ischaemia, and together with the histopathological findings indicated that the heart suffers from the same pathological processes described in other organs in canine babesiosis, namely inflammation and hypoxia. As the clinical application of the ECG changes found in this thesis was limited, cardiovascular assessment should be based on functional monitoring rather than ECG. Using cardiac troponin as a marker of myocardial injury, this thesis showed that myocardial cell injury occurs with canine babesiosis. Cardiac troponins, especially troponin I, are sensitive markers of myocardial injury in canine babesiosis, and the magnitude of elevation of plasma troponin I concentrations appears to be proportional to the severity of the disease. ECG changes and serum cardiac troponin were correlated with histopathology. On cardiac histopathology from dogs that succumbed to babesiosis, haemorrhage, necrosis, inflammation and fibrin microthrombi in the myocardium were documented, all of which would have resulted in ECG changes and elevations in cardiac troponin. Myocardial infarction causes left ventricular failure, which will result in hypotension and an expansion of the plasma volume due to homeostatic mechanisms. This thesis showed that dogs with babesiosis had hypoalbuminaemia, which may be because of intravascular volume dilution due to fluid retention. In disease hypoalbuminaemia can occur as a negative acute-phase protein. In the light of the cardiac changes, hyponatraemia, and hypotension, a probable cause would be fluid retention due to myocardial disease. This thesis showed that dogs with babesiosis had left ventricular lesions, which can result in systolic heart failure. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.
