40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the effects of heel-forefoot height on ankle kinematics during locomotion in children. Measurements were taken by a motion capture system and a force plate on five children. They were asked to perform standing, walking, jogging and sidestepping in barefoot, low <b>heel,</b> standard <b>heel</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> shoe conditions. Results showed that rearfoot plantarflexion angle was different from shoe rake during standing. There was more ankle plantarflexion as heel height increased during walking, jogging and sidestepping. Ankle inversion velocity increased with shod condition but not significantly. <b>High</b> <b>heel</b> height will affect ankle kinematics during locomotion, which may increase the risk of foot problems.
