5|$|A {{team from}} the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 that it had measured {{the density of the}} binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less than that of water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus. Such <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> densities suggests that density may not be a good indicator of asteroid origin.|$|E
5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends.

5|$|Dale Russell {{hypothesized}} that the more lightly built and more common Gorgosaurus may have preyed on the abundant hadrosaurs of the time, while the more robust and less common Daspletosaurus may have specialized on the less prevalent but better-defended ceratopsids, {{which may have been}} more difficult to hunt. However, a specimen of Daspletosaurus (OTM 200) from the Two Medicine Formation preserves the digested remains of a juvenile hadrosaur in its gut region. The higher and broader muzzles of tyrannosaurines like Daspletosaurus are mechanically stronger than the lower snouts of albertosaurines like Gorgosaurus, although tooth strengths are similar between the two groups. This may indicate <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> feeding mechanics or diet.|$|E
5|$|Directional {{anisotropy}} {{refers to}} <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> diffusion mechanism or rate {{in a particular}} direction on a given crystallographic plane. These differences may {{be a result of}} either anisotropy in the surface lattice (e.g. a rectangular lattice) or the presence of steps on a surface. One of the more dramatic examples of directional anisotropy is the diffusion of adatoms on channeled surfaces such as fcc (110), where diffusion along the channel is much faster than diffusion across the channel.|$|E

Splitting the sample at the median into <b>a</b> “small <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> information group” and <b>a</b> “large <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> information group” and comparing appropriateness ratings for CAT vs. the QLQ-C 30 in these groups revealed that for PF <b>a</b> small <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> information was associated with only small <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> appropriateness ratings (45.5 % CAT, 31.8 % indifferent, 22.7 % QLQ-C 30) and <b>a</b> large <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> information {{was associated with a}} clearly higher subjective appropriateness of CAT (68.2 % CAT, 22.7 % indifferent, 9.1 % QLQ-C 30).

5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} {{works by}} using energy-releasing chemical reactions to drive energy-requiring reactions: The {{two sets of}} reactions {{are said to be}} coupled. This means one cannot occur without the other. The flow of electrons through the electron transport chain, from electron donors such as NADH to electron acceptors such as oxygen, is an exergonic process– it releases energy, whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process, which requires an input of energy. Both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane, and energy is transferred from electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane, in a process called chemiosmosis. In practice, this is like a simple electric circuit, with a current of protons being driven from the negative N-side of the membrane to the positive P-side by the proton-pumping enzymes of the electron transport chain. These enzymes are like a battery, as they perform work to drive current through the circuit. The movement of protons creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which is often called the proton-motive force. It has two components: <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> proton concentration (a H+ gradient, ΔpH) and <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> electric potential, with the N-side having a negative charge.|$|E

Because this effect {{may be due to the}} prominent sex <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> barbiturate sensitivity, the present report examined perforant path-dentate granule cell synaptic transmission and {{long-term potentiation}} (LTP) in adult male and female rats anesthetized with urethane. Spectral analysis of hippocampal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity indicated that urethane induced similar levels of anesthesia in male and female rats, and there were no sex <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the latency or amplitude of extracellular field potentials evoked in the dentate gyrus following perforant path stimulation. In contrast, there was <b>a</b> robust sex <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the magnitude of LTP induced in the dentate gyrus following high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the perforant path. This sex <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> LTP was paralleled by <b>a</b> sex <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the magnitude of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation generated by perforant path HFS.

5|$|There are {{no known}} {{morphological}} {{differences between the}} three island populations, but Turvey and colleagues found that animals from Nevis were slightly smaller than those from the two other islands.

However, Turvey and colleagues also observed that their Saint Kitts material consisted of older individuals than those from Nevis; thus, the size difference may result from differences in the mode of exploitation by Amerindians.|$|E
