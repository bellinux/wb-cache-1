5|$|When {{they live}} in {{polluted}} waters, bivalve molluscs {{have a tendency to}} accumulate substances such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in their tissues. This is because they ingest the chemicals as they feed but their enzyme systems are not capable of metabolising them and as a result, the levels build up. This may be a health hazard for the molluscs themselves, and is one for humans who eat them. It also has certain advantages in that bivalves can be used in monitoring the presence <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> pollutants in their environment.|$|E
5|$|After Leonid Brezhnev assumed {{power in}} 1964, much of Khrushchev's reforms were reversed. The Brezhnev era began {{a new state}} of stagnation, and saw a decline in both the quality <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> {{products}} in the Soviet Union. Armenia was severely affected by these policies, as was to be demonstrated several years later in the catastrophic earthquake that hit Spitak. Material allocated to the building of new homes, such as cement and concrete, was diverted for other uses. Bribery {{and a lack of}} oversight saw the construction of shoddily built and weakly supported apartment buildings. When the earthquake hit on the morning of December 7, 1988, the houses and apartments least able to resist collapse were those built during the Brezhnev years. Ironically, the older the dwellings, the better they withstood the quake.|$|E
5|$|Rhodotus is a genus in {{the fungus}} family Physalacriaceae. It is a {{monotypic}} genus {{and consists of}} the single mushroom species Rhodotus palmatus, known in the vernacular as the netted rhodotus, the rosy veincap, or the wrinkled peach. This uncommon species has a circumboreal distribution, and has been collected in eastern North America, northern Africa, Europe, and Asia; declining populations in Europe have led to its appearance in {{over half of the}} European fungal Red Lists of threatened species. Typically found growing on the stumps and logs of rotting hardwoods, mature specimens may usually be identified by the pinkish color and the distinctive ridged and veined surface of their rubbery caps; variations in the color <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> light received during development lead to variations in the size, shape, and cap color of fruit bodies.|$|E

5|$|Vocalisations are {{frequent}} as the juveniles disperse, {{and again as}} they congregate in the morning. Nearby adults, presumably the parents, also give signals warning of predators or alerting the youngsters {{to the presence of}} food. The range <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> vocalisations vary between species. Alligators are the noisiest, while some crocodile species are almost completely silent. Adult female New Guinea crocodiles and Siamese crocodiles roar when approached by another adult, while Nile crocodiles grunt or bellow in a similar situation. The American alligator is exceptionally noisy; it emits a series of about seven throaty bellows, each a couple of seconds long, at ten second intervals. It also makes various grunts and hisses. Males create vibrations in the water to send out infrasonic signals that serve to attract females and intimidate rivals. The enlarged boss of the male gharial may serve as a sound resonator.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{biennial}} {{reports from the}} U.S. National Research Council have reviewed the progress of CERP. The fourth report in the series, released in 2012, found that little {{progress has been made}} in restoring the core of the remaining Everglades ecosystem; instead, most project construction so far has occurred along its periphery. The report noted that to reverse ongoing ecosystem declines, it will be necessary to expedite restoration projects that target the central Everglades, and to improve both the quality <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> the water in the ecosystem. To better understand the potential implications of the current slow pace of progress, the report assessed the current status of ten Everglades ecosystem attributes, including phosphorus loads, peat depth, and populations of snail kites, birds of prey that are endangered in South Florida. Most attributes received grades ranging from C (degraded) to D (significantly degraded), but the snail kite received a grade of F (near irreversible damage). The report also assessed the future trajectory of each ecosystem attribute under three restoration scenarios: improved water quality, improved hydrology, and improvements to both water quality and hydrology, which helped highlight the urgency of restoration actions to benefit a wide range of ecosystem attributes and demonstrate the cost of inaction. Overall, the report concluded that substantial near-term progress to address both water quality and hydrology in the central Everglades is needed to reverse ongoing degradation before it is too late.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{specimens}} of Limusaurus show morphological traits associated with herbivory that are shared {{with other groups}} of herbivorous theropods, including the Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, Oviraptorosauria, and Alvarezsauroidea, along with the troodontid Jinfengopteryx. In particular, adult specimens are characterized {{by the presence of}} stomach stones (gastroliths), with older adults having gastroliths that are larger and more numerous than those of younger adults; the size <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> these gastroliths are comparable to those of birds in young adults, and those of ornithomimosaurs and oviraptorosaurs in old adults. These groups of theropods all used gastroliths in processing plant matter, suggesting that Limusaurus did the same; the increased amount of gastroliths in older adults may be indicative of the gut's ability to finely process plant matter increasing with age. An isotope analysis of the available {{specimens of}} Limusaurus specimens likewise showed that adults consistently match the isotope signatures of other herbivorous dinosaurs; however, in the same analysis, juveniles and subadults were found to vary greatly in their isotopic signatures. This indicates that juveniles were likely omnivorous, but switched to strict herbivory as they aged. This is comparable to the diet shift experienced by the aforementioned mullets and armored catfish.|$|E

5|$|On 22 August 1958, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{announced}} a one-year moratorium on nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958, if the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom {{also agreed to}} suspend testing. Britain had already indicated that it would do so, and the Soviet Union agreed on 30 August. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, all three all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline. The British scientists needed to gather as much data as possible {{to allow them to}} design production nuclear weapons. Moreover, as the prospect of increased American cooperation grew after October 1957, they knew that the quality <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> what the Americans would share would depend on what they had to offer. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies {{such as the use of}} external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride permitted a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices. It would be the biggest and most complex British test series.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} dual-response {{forwarding}} approach for renting air containers and simultaneously determining how cargoes are distributed into the containers under uncertain information. Containers {{have to be}} booked in advance to obtain a discount rental rate from airlines, as urgent requirement or cancellation of containers {{on the day of}} shipping will incur a heavy penalty. We firstly formulate a mixed 0 - 1 integer model to determine the booking types <b>and</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> containers for the deterministic problem under accurate information. We then formulate a stochastic mixed 0 - 1 model to structure a dual-response forwarding system for the uncertain problem where accurate information is not available when booking. The first-stage response is to determine the booking types <b>and</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> containers. The second-stage response is to prepare for different scenarios that might occur on the day of shipping, including the types <b>and</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> containers required or returned for each scenario, and also the corresponding cargo loading plan. Computational results show that the stochastic model can provide a cost-efficient, flexible and responsive cargo forwarding syste...|$|R
