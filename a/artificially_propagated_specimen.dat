40|$|A small {{population}} {{is found in}} South Africa near the Namibian border, and several other large populations are reported in Namibia. These populations no longer appear to be endangered by collecting, {{primarily because of the}} wide availability of <b>artificially</b> <b>propagated</b> plants. In addition, their habitat is not threatened. The Namibian populations are regenerating well, with numerous young plants. The species has been listed in Appendix I since 1 983. Large quantities of <b>artificially</b> <b>propagated</b> <b>specimens</b> of P. namaquanum are available in Europe and the United States (D. Supthut, pers comm). In addition, the low cost of these plants and surveillance measures established in the field deter potential collectors. An adequate number of “parent plants ” are also available in nurseries, particularly in the United States. These “parent plants ” produce large numbers of seeds. The collection of seeds from wild plants is difficult, since, when the fruit of the Apocynaceae dry, they release large quantities of feathery seeds, which are carried far away by the wind. It can be reasonably assumed that enough seeds escape to regenerate the population, even with sustained collection. In addition, the immature fruit cannot be collected, since the seeds will not ripen or germinate.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of recent {{developments}} in artificial propagation of cod fry {{it has been suggested}} that propagated cod fry may be released in the Barents Sea and the Svalbard region, the feeding areas of North-East Arctic cod. The aim would be to improve the periodical bad state of this stock. The North-East Arctic cod is spawning from February to April, and the first abundance index of a new yearclass is assessed at an age of six months by midwater trawl survey. Estimates of year class abundance (VPA) vary between 115 and 1818 million fish at age 3, a much smaller range than indicated by the 0 -group survey indexes for six months old cod. In August/September the 0 -group cod are distributed in the Barents Sea, around Bear Island and along West-Spitsbergen. Strong yearclasses have a much wider distribution than poor ones. Information from this survey may be used in planning the release of <b>artificially</b> <b>propagated</b> cod fry, which could then take place in September. Because of lack of reliable basis for estimating the natural mortality of cod; especially on the younger age groups, the number of cod fry in September cannot be precisely estimated. However, for areas on able range of natural mortalities, the number of fry needed to raise a poor year class to a strong one at the 0 -group stage would be in the order of 2600 - 5200 million. Artificial propagation of cod fry would have to start in March, but it may be stopped later in years with high natural production of fry in order to reduce the effects of density dependent growth. <b>Artificially</b> <b>propagated</b> fry should have to be released in the most suit able areas. Observations on hydrographical and food conditions are therefore needed for the most suitable time. In order to avoid a high degree of cannibalism, the distribution of l- 3 -group cod would also have to be taken into account. A programme for artificial propagation of North-East Arctic cod fry would be justifiable in years or periods with low potential yearclass strength. However, our state of knowledge about the many factors involved does not at present justify such an extensive programme...|$|R

40|$|Background—Gastric {{electrical}} stimulation has been attempted {{for several years}} with little success.  Aims—To determine whether movement of liquid gastric content could be achieved using microprocessor controlled sequential {{electrical stimulation}}.  Methods—Eight anaesthetised dogs underwent laparotomy and implantation of four sets of bipolar stainless steel wire electrodes. Each set consisted of two to six electrodes (10 × 0. 25 mm, 3 cm apart) implanted circumferentially. The stomach was filled with water {{and the process of}} gastric emptying was monitored. Artificial contractions were produced using microprocessor controlled phase locked bipolar four second trains of 50 Hz, 14 V (peak to peak) rectangular voltage. In four of the dogs four force transducers were implanted close to each circumferential electrode set. In one gastroparetic patient the effect of direct electrical stimulation was determined at laparotomy.  Results—Using the above stimulating parameters circumferential gastric contractions were produced which were <b>artificially</b> <b>propagated</b> distally by phase locking the stimulating voltage. Averaged stimulated gastric emptying times were significantly shorter than spontaneus emptying times (t 1 / 2 6. 7 (3. 0) versus 25. 3 (12. 9) minutes, p< 0. 01).
