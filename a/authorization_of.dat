5|$|After {{the cathedral}} in Gamla Uppsala was damaged by fire in 1204, the Chapter sought {{permission}} from the Holy See to move the building to a larger site.

At a meeting in Söderköping in September 1270, Archbishop Fulco Angelus and the cathedral chapter decided the site should be in Östra Aros.

5|$|A {{study by}} the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be {{successful}} in two out of three peacekeeping efforts.

Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a {{decline in the number of}} wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the <b>authorization</b> <b>of</b> intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E
5|$|In August 1718, Bonnet {{anchored}} the Royal James on an estuary of the Cape Fear River {{to careen}} and repair the ship. In late August and September, Colonel William Rhett, with the <b>authorization</b> <b>of</b> South Carolina governor Robert Johnson, led a naval expedition against pirates on the river. Rhett and Bonnet's men fought {{each other for}} hours, but the outnumbered pirates ultimately surrendered. Rhett arrested the pirates and brought them to Charles Town in early October. Bonnet escaped on 24October, but was recaptured on Sullivan's Island. On 10November, Bonnet was brought to trial and charged with two acts of piracy. Judge Nicholas Trott sentenced Bonnet to death. Bonnet wrote to Governor Johnson to ask for clemency, but Johnson endorsed the judge's decision, and Bonnet was hanged in Charles Town on 10December 1718.|$|E

5|$|New {{government}} spending, regulation, {{and policies}} helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better {{than many other}} sectors. Most notably, U.S. President Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included more than $70billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs. This policy-stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in U.S. history for renewables, advanced transportation, and energy conservation initiatives. Based on these new rules, many more utilities strengthened their clean-energy programs. Clean Edge suggests that the commercialization of clean energy will help {{countries around the world}} deal with the current economic malaise. Once-promising solar energy company, Solyndra, became involved in a political controversy involving U.S. President Barack Obama's administration's <b>authorization</b> <b>of</b> a $535million loan guarantee to the Corporation in 2009 as part of a program to promote alternative energy growth. The company ceased all business activity, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and laid-off nearly all of its employees in early September 2011.|$|E
5|$|Biden is {{considered}} to be a moderate liberal, clocking a 77.5 percent liberal voting record in 2006 and lifetime score of 76.8 percent. Biden is Pro-Choice on abortion rated 100% by NARAL and supports a state's right to have civil unions. He favors a Balanced Budget Amendment and a rollback of the Bush tax cuts. He supports the PATRIOT Act, the war in Afghanistan and voted in favor of <b>authorization</b> <b>of</b> military force into Iraq. He believes a political solution can be met in Iraq through federalization. Biden would favor American military intervention into Sudan to end the Darfur genocide. He supports Gun control and was given an F by the NRA. He opposes the No Child Left Behind Act although he voted in favor of it in 2002. Biden opposes capital punishment and supports the continuation of the war on drugs. In 2007 he voted in favor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill and supports a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Biden opposes oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and believes that the government must take action against global warming.|$|E
5|$|In these {{conflict}} of laws cases, Apple met with conflicting international judicial opinions: an Australian court decision conflicted with a Canadian court decision on the copyrightability of object code. In IBM v. Computer Imports, the High Court of New Zealand then considered these prior decisions and sided with the Canadian decision in ruling that, although object code is not an original literary work in its own right, it is a reproduction of source code in material form and therefore an infringement of copyright takes place if it is copied without the <b>authorization</b> <b>of</b> the copyright owner. Such legal conflicts affected not only Apple, but all other software companies as well, and the conflicts remained unresolved until {{the creation of an}} international legal regime embodied in further changes to national copyright laws, which ultimately made object code subject to copyright law. These revisions of law in favor of making object code subject to copyright law are still controversial. The revisions also form the technical underpinnings (via the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act) for the legal notions of electronic privacy violation and computer trespass, as well as the further development of anti-hacking law-making such as the Patriot Act and the Convention on Cybercrime.|$|E

40|$|Composite {{applications}} rely {{on further}} sub-applications – also called sub-activities {{in the following}} – to implement their functionality. There are numerous examples including quite simple Web applications as well as large scale enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that interact with database backends. Also, business processes that are realized as Web service workflows represent complex composite applications. Thereby, sub-activities can constitute composite applications themselves. In general, sub-applications are self-contained software modules that autonomously enforce their own security policies. This autonomy <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> can lead to significant performance drawbacks: On the one hand, the <b>authorizations</b> <b>of</b> legitimate users are evaluated repeatedly. On the other hand, requests of ultimately unauthorized users that lack authorizations at later stages of the workflow can lead to transaction rollbacks or demand for compensating transactions. Thus, it appears beneficial to evaluate the <b>authorizations</b> <b>of</b> users {{as soon as possible}} by shifting access control to the workflow layer instead of retaining it at the sub-activities.
