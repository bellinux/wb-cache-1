5|$|In WWE's {{documentary}} CM Punk: Best in the World {{released in}} 2012, {{it was documented}} from the out-of-universe perspective that a disenchanted Punk rejected signing a new contract with WWE {{for more than a}} year leading up to Money in the Bank. After being persuaded by Joey Mercury and Lars Frederiksen that he could only help wrestlers underappreciated by WWE (like himself) if he stayed, Punk signed a new contract with WWE <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> capturing the WWE Championship from Cena, while the pay-per-view event was ongoing.|$|E

5|$|The {{sea otter}} is diurnal. It has {{a period of}} {{foraging}} and eating in the morning, starting <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> sunrise, then rests or sleeps in mid-day. Foraging resumes {{for a few hours}} in the afternoon and subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur around midnight. Females with pups appear to be more inclined to feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a sea otter must spend each day foraging range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability of food in the area.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the details}} of Hendrix's last day and death are widely disputed, {{he spent much of}} September 17, 1970, in London with Monika Dannemann, the only witness to his final hours. Dannemann said that she {{prepared}} a meal for them at her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel, 22 Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill, sometime around 11 p.m., when they shared a bottle of wine. She drove Hendrix to the residence of an acquaintance at approximately 1:45a.m., where he remained for <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> she picked him up and drove them back to her flat at 3 a.m. Dannemann said they talked until around 7 a.m., when they went to sleep. She awoke around 11 a.m., and found Hendrix breathing, but unconscious and unresponsive. She called for an ambulance at 11:18a.m., which arrived on the scene at 11:27a.m. Paramedics then transported Hendrix to St Mary Abbot's Hospital where Dr. John Bannister pronounced him dead at 12:45p.m. on September 18, 1970.|$|E
5|$|The Director Task Force's commander—Brigadier General Julian W. Cunningham—issued {{orders for}} the landing on 4December. He {{directed}} that the Task Force would initially capture the Arawe Peninsula and its surrounding islands and establish an outpost on the trail leading to the Pulie River. The {{main body of the}} Director Task Force was to land at House Fireman Beach on the Arawe Peninsula at about dawn. Two troop-sized forces would conduct separate operations <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> the main landing. One troop was to capture Pitoe Island to the peninsula's south, as it was believed that the Japanese had established a radio station and a defensive position there which commanded the entrance to Arawe Harbor. The other troop was to land at Umtingalu and establish a blocking position on the coastal trail east of the peninsula. Once the beachhead was secure, amphibious patrols would be conducted {{to the west of the}} peninsula in an attempt to make contact with the Marines at Cape Gloucester. U.S.Navy personnel on the planning staff were concerned about these subsidiary landings, as a night-time landing conducted at Lae in September had proven difficult.|$|E

25|$|The {{makers of}} the show insist that the answers are not given to the panelists beforehand. The host is given a list of {{questions}} <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> the show, for preparatory purposes, but the guests are forbidden to ask for preparatory materials or other help. Alan Davies never does any preparation.|$|E
25|$|On 19 July, Tsvetanov {{stated that}} the {{suspected}} attacker is seen on security camera tape near the bus for <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> the blast {{and that he had}} a fake driver's license from the U.S. state of Michigan.

25|$|In April 1998, a dime-sized {{plastic nut}} came loose on The Mighty Axe (now called Tak Attack), causing {{the ride to}} come to a stop with riders stuck upside down at the very top. The loose nut had {{interrupted}} the power to the seating platform. The five riders were stuck for <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> park mechanics were able to get them down.|$|E
25|$|The troupes {{orchestra}} {{would be}} made up of such instruments as the trumpet, trombone, violin, trap drum and cymbals. The orchestra would start to play popular songs of the day and marches in front of the theatre <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> the show to drum up interest. This intermission or Antrak music ended up with the well-known Izmir March, a sign that the show time was approaching. The play began as the musicians went in and took their places {{at the side of the}} stage.|$|E
25|$|The lead {{elements}} of Sedgwick's VI Corps reached Saunders Field at 3 p.m., {{by which time}} Warren's men had ceased fighting. Sedgwick attacked Ewell's line in the woods north of the Turnpike and both sides traded attacks and counterattacks that lasted <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> each disengaged to erect earthworks. During the fray, Confederate Brig. Gen. Leroy A. Stafford was shot through the shoulder blade, the bullet severing his spine. Despite being paralyzed {{from the waist down}} and in agonizing pain, he managed to still urge his troops forward.|$|E
5000|$|<b>About</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> midnight, {{however, the}} Confederates {{set fire to}} steamer A.

25|$|On August 6, 2010, various {{media outlets}} {{released}} {{a transcript of}} conversations between an RCMP undercover operator and Pickton in his holding cell. While the RCMP censored the undercover officer's name {{throughout most of the}} document, his name was left uncensored in several portions of the document that the RCMP released to the public. This uncensored version was available to the public, through Global News, CTV News, and the Vancouver Sun, for <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> being pulled and re-edited. It is not known the extent of the damage this mistake caused the undercover officer.|$|E
25|$|Shuttle {{crew members}} were awakened at 06:29 UTC. Undocking {{operations}} began <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> {{the separation of}} the shuttle and the Space Station. The two spacecraft undocked at 09:53 UTC. The total docked time was 6 days, 17 hours and 2 minutes. After undocking, Wilmore piloted Atlantis to a point about 450 feet ahead of the station, then, began a flyaround. Once the flyaround was completed, Atlantis performed separation burns to increase the distance between the shuttle and the ISS and left the Space Station complex area at about 10:36 UTC.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of July 19, 2005, Bush {{announced}} his first Supreme Court nominee, John G. Roberts, Jr., a highly regarded former Supreme Court litigator and conservative judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. During the day {{leading up to the}} announcement, there had been much media speculation that one of either two female judges on the Fifth Circuit would get the nod: moderate Edith Brown Clement or conservative Edith H. Jones. Clement was considered the frontrunner. <b>About</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> the televised announcement, however, information was leaked to the press concerning the choice of Roberts.|$|E
50|$|The Northern {{warships}} {{entered the}} Roanoke River from Middle River above Plymouth and headed downstream toward the Confederate defensive works. <b>About</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> noon, they opened fire; and, after almost <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of bitter fighting, the Southern troops withdrew, leaving the Union forces {{in control of}} the area.|$|R

60|$|At length, <b>about</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> nightfall, {{the dwarf}} {{appeared}} {{at the mouth of}} the cave, looking more like a gnome than a man against the lurid background of the angry sky.

25|$|Likewise, the Opana Radar Site {{detected}} {{the attack on}} Pearl Harbor <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> it reached the island. They telephoned the communications office that {{was in charge of}} disseminating such information and made their report. The office had been informed that a flight of B-17 Flying Fortress bombers would be arriving that day, but lacked any sort of information on their location, at that time far to the east. The communications officer, Lt. Kermit Tyler, concluded the radar site had spotted the bombers, and failed to pass on the warning. The Japanese attack went unopposed.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} oxidation state of thorium is +4, represented in compounds such as thorium dioxide (ThO2) and thorium tetrafluoride (ThF4), although some compounds are known with thorium in lower formal oxidation states. Owing to thorium(IV)'s lack of electrons in 6d and 5f orbitals, the tetravalent thorium compounds are colourless. Th3+ compounds are uncommon {{due to the}} large negative reduction potential of the Th4+/Th3+ couple. In 1997, reports of amber Th3+ (aq) being generated from thorium tetrachloride and ammonia were published: the ion was supposedly stable for <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> it was oxidised by water. However, the reaction was shown the next year to be thermodynamically impossible and the more likely explanation for the signals was azido-chloro complexes of thorium(IV). In fact, the redox potentials of thorium, protactinium, and uranium are much more {{similar to those of}} the d-block transition metals than the lanthanides, reflecting their historic placement prior to the 1940s as the heaviest members of groups 4, 5, and 6 in the periodic table respectively.|$|E
25|$|<b>About</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> midnight, {{the club}} was engulfed in flames because of a spark set off by pyrotechnics. Some {{witnesses}} said there was an explosion, but this was disputed and later dismissed by other sources. The club's ceiling was supported by pillars, which were coated with a flammable soundproofing foam. Soon after the pyrotechnics began, the foam {{on one of the}} pillars was ignited. The fire spread rapidly to the ceiling, eventually causing it to collapse. Media reported that club-goers initially thought the flames were part of the show and did not immediately react. When the ceiling caught fire, the approximately 200 to 400 people in the club panicked and rushed to the only working exit door at the venue, creating a stampede. The two-part door was only half opened, thus too narrow, so people climbed {{on top of each other}} in order to get out. Many of the casualties suffered from leg injuries after being trampled. A witness said terrified concert-goers had to break down the other half of the door to escape, but many people had already suffered burns, or were in respiratory distress. People also smashed windows in order to escape.|$|E
2500|$|On October 6, the JDL is {{suspected}} of bombing the New York office of the Palestine Liberation Organization after the PLO hijacked four airliners the previous month.

50|$|Flying flocks make a {{distinct}} sound {{due to the}} many wing beats. After arriving at the roost or nest site, birds keep moving around and {{make a lot of}} noise for <b>about</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> settling in. Both male and female call. The male sings in short bursts, starting with some chatter, followed by a warbling tweedle-toodle-tweedle.|$|R
50|$|<b>About</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> noon on 28 April, Annie sighted, chased, {{and fired}} upon Dream before that British {{schooner}} escaped into Spanish territorial waters off Cuba.
