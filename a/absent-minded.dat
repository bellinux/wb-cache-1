5|$|In the episode, Will (Eric McCormack) reluctantly {{decides to}} use a {{birthday}} gift certificate from Grace (Debra Messing) to consult a psychic about his future and encounters Sue (Manheim), an <b>absent-minded</b> psychic whose prediction leaves him reeling. Meanwhile, pop singer-songwriter Cher encounters her biggest fan: Jack (Sean Hayes); and Karen (Megan Mullally) frowns on Grace's new employee (Romanus) at the design firm.|$|E
5|$|Billy, though experienced, {{is still}} {{somewhat}} goofy and <b>absent-minded.</b> He sometimes helps Harry with scenes and Harry tries {{to convince him}} too {{that he is an}} actor and not a prostitute. On several occasions, Billy picks up men only to discover that the man is not actually his client. In one case he and the man fall in love and they plan to get Billy out of the business and start a life together. Shortly thereafter, Billy mistakes a man (Michael Haynes) for a client in a public restroom and that man stabs him to death.|$|E
5|$|These films {{took many}} liberties {{from the book}} series casting-wise. Red-haired Granville's {{portrayal}} of the then-blonde Nancy was portrayed to be ditzy, <b>absent-minded,</b> and more meddling that that of the ongoing book series. While the Carson Drew of the books was portrayed as older, feeble, {{and more of a}} hands-off parent, John Litel's Carson was young and handsome, much more athletically fit, and tried his best to restrain Nancy from getting into danger. Ned/Ted was even more drastically altered: instead of being Nancy's boyfriend in college who lives in a different town, he was now her next-door neighbor, who was a year older than her and their romance was very ambiguous and tumultuous. The recurring character of the older Hannah Gruen was replaced with Effie Schneider, a minor character in the books who was Hannah's teenage niece. Effie and Hannah's characteristics were merged, although Effie's fidgety, frightful nature retained prominence for comedic effect. In addition to these four, a new character Captain Tweedy was added, to portray the stereotypical bumbling, clueless cop that mirrored Steve McBride in the Torchy Blane series. Nancy's friends Bess and George did not appear in the film series, and never mentioned or referred to.|$|E
5|$|When he {{was four}} years old, Gustav {{discovered}} his grandparents' piano and took to it immediately. He developed his performing skills sufficiently {{to be considered a}} local Wunderkind and gave his first public performance at the town theatre when he was ten years old. Although Gustav loved making music, his school reports from the Iglau Gymnasium portrayed him as <b>absent-minded</b> and unreliable in academic work. In 1871, in the hope of improving the boy's results, his father sent him to the New Town Gymnasium in Prague, but Gustav was unhappy there and soon returned to Iglau. On 13 April 1875 he suffered a bitter personal loss when his younger brother Ernst (b. 18 March 1862) died after a long illness. Mahler sought to express his feelings in music: {{with the help of a}} friend, Josef Steiner, he began work on an opera, Herzog Ernst von Schwaben ("Duke Ernest of Swabia") as a memorial to his lost brother. Neither the music nor the libretto of this work has survived.|$|E
5|$|The novel recaps Penelope's life in {{hindsight}} from 21st century Hades; she recalls her family life in Sparta, {{her marriage to}} Odysseus, her dealing with suitors during his absence, and the aftermath of Odysseus' return. The relationship with her parents was challenging: her father became overly affectionate after attempting to murder her, and her mother was <b>absent-minded</b> and negligent. At fifteen, Penelope married Odysseus, who had rigged the contest that decided which suitor would marry her. Penelope was happy with him, {{even though he was}} mocked behind his back by Helen and some maids for his short stature and lesser developed home, Ithaca. The couple broke with tradition by moving to the husband's kingdom. In Ithaca, neither Odysseus' mother Anticleia, nor his nurse Eurycleia, liked Penelope but eventually Eurycleia helped Penelope settle into her new role and became friendly, but often patronising. Shortly after the birth of their son, Telemachus, Odysseus was called to war, leaving Penelope to run the kingdom and raise Telemachus alone. News of the war and rumours of Odysseus' journey back sporadically reached Ithaca and with the growing possibility that Odysseus was not returning an increasing number of suitors moved in to court Penelope. Convinced the suitors were more interested in controlling her kingdom than loving her, she stalled them. The suitors pressured her by consuming and wasting much of the kingdom's resources. She feared violence if she outright denied their offer of marriage so she announced she would make her decision on which to marry once she finished her father-in-law's shroud. She enlisted twelve maids to help her unravel the shroud at night and spy on the suitors. Odysseus eventually returned but in disguise. Penelope recognised him immediately and instructed her maids not to reveal his identity. After the suitors were massacred, Odysseus instructed Telemachus to execute the maids who he believed were in league with them. Twelve were hanged while Penelope slept. Afterwards, Penelope and Odysseus told each other stories of their time apart, but {{on the issue of the}} maids Penelope remained silent to avoid the appearance of sympathy for those already judged and condemned as traitors.|$|E

25|$|Dreams of <b>absent-minded</b> {{transgression}} (DAMT) are dreams {{wherein the}} dreamer absentmindedly performs {{an action that}} he or she has been trying to stop (one classic example is of a quitting smoker having dreams of lighting a cigarette). Subjects who have had DAMT have reported waking with intense feelings of guilt. One study found a positive association between having these dreams and successfully stopping the behavior.|$|E
25|$|Nancy Olson's pairing with William Holden was {{considered}} a success, and she appeared opposite him in several films during the 1950s, although none of them repeated their earlier success. She went on to star in The <b>Absent-Minded</b> Professor (1961) and Son of Flubber (1963), {{in which she was}} paired with Fred MacMurray, but despite the films' popularity with movie-goers, her career stalled. Holden and Wilder also rejoined forces in 1978 for Fedora, another film critical of Hollywood.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} 1797–1801 Burney wrote three comedies {{that were not}} to be {{published}} in her lifetime: Love and Fashion, A Busy Day and The Woman Hater. The last is partly a reworking of subject-matter from The Witlings, but with the satirical elements toned down and more emphasis placed on reforming her characters' faults. The play, first performed in December 2007 at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond, UK, retains one of the central characters, Lady Smatter – an <b>absent-minded</b> but inveterate quoter of poetry, perhaps meant as a comic rendering of a Bluestocking. All the other characters in The Woman Hater differ from those in The Witlings.|$|E
25|$|On Harry's {{graduation}} {{night in}} 1928, George talks to Mary Hatch, {{who has had}} a crush on him from an early age. They are interrupted by news of his father's death. George postpones his travel plans in order to sort out the family business, Bailey Brothers' Building and Loan, a longtime competitor to Henry F. Potter, the local banker and the richest man in town. Potter wishes to dissolve the Building and Loan to take over its business. George convinces the board of directors to vote against Potter. They agree, on condition that George runs the business, along with his <b>absent-minded</b> uncle Billy. George and Mary get married. On their way to their honeymoon, they witness a run on the bank and use their honeymoon savings to lend financial support at the Building and Loan until the bank reopens.|$|E
500|$|A {{performance}} of [...] "The <b>Absent-Minded</b> Beggar March" [...] on 21 July 1900 at The Crystal Palace was Sullivan's last public appearance, and the composer died four months later. [...] "The <b>Absent-Minded</b> Beggar" [...] remained popular throughout the three-year war {{and for years}} after the war ended. It became a part of popular culture of the time, with its title becoming a popular phrase and cartoons, postcards and other humorous representations of the character of the <b>absent-minded</b> beggar becoming popular. The song is performed in John Osborne's 1957 play The Entertainer. T. S. Eliot included the poem in his 1941 collection A Choice of Kipling's Verse.|$|E
500|$|Einstein {{has been}} the subject of or {{inspiration}} for many novels, films, plays, and works of music. He is a favorite model for depictions of mad scientists and <b>absent-minded</b> professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. Time magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was [...] "a cartoonist's dream come true".|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of the poem was such that allusions to it were common. Mark Twain wrote that [...] "The clarion-peal of its lines thrilled the world". By 18 November, {{less than a month}} after publication of the poem, [...] "a new patriotic play" [...] was advertised to open the next week, titled The Absent Minded Beggar, or, For Queen and Country. The same month, the Charity Organisation Society called [...] "The <b>Absent-Minded</b> Beggar" [...] the [...] "most prominent figure on the charitable horizon at present." [...] Even a critical book on the conduct of the war, published in 1900, was titled An <b>Absent-Minded</b> War. Kipling was offered a knighthood within a few weeks of publication of the song but declined, as he declined all offers of State honours. Historian Stephen M. Miller wrote in 2007, [...] "Kipling almost single-handedly restored the strong ties between civilians and soldiers and put Britain and its army back together again." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The <b>Absent-Minded</b> Beggar" [...] is an 1899 poem by Rudyard Kipling, set {{to music}} by Sir Arthur Sullivan and often {{accompanied}} by an illustration of a wounded but defiant British soldier, [...] "A Gentleman in Kharki", by Richard Caton Woodville. The song was written {{as part of an}} appeal by the Daily Mail to raise money for soldiers fighting in the Second Boer War and their families. The fund was the first such charitable effort for a war.|$|E
500|$|The song {{is still}} heard on re-issues of early {{recordings}} and on post-Second World War recordings by Donald Adams and others. In 1942, George Orwell noted that [...] "The phrase [...] "killing Kruger with your mouth" ... was current till very recently". In 2010, a Kipling conference, called [...] "Following The <b>Absent-minded</b> Beggar" [...] {{was held at}} the School of the Humanities of the University of Bristol, organised by Dr. John Lee, that included lectures and an exhibition of memorabilia and documents relating to the poem and song.|$|E
500|$|The poem, {{song and}} piano music sold in {{extraordinary}} numbers, as did {{all kinds of}} household items, postcards, memorabilia and other merchandise emblazoned, woven or engraved with the [...] "Gentleman in Kharki" [...] figure, the poem itself, the sheet music, or humorous illustrations. Some of these items were very expensive. 40 clerks answered 12,000 requests a day for copies of the poem, and it was included in 148,000 packets of cigarettes within two months of the first performance. Alternative arrangements of the song were published, such as [...] "The <b>Absent-Minded</b> Beggar March".|$|E
500|$|In March 1953 Jacques {{gave birth}} to her first son, Robin, and {{returned}} to work after a few days to film Up to His Neck. Later that year she provided the lead alongside Le Mesurier in the 38-minute [...] "movie-masque" [...] The Pleasure Garden; filmed in 1952, it won the [...] at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival. From October until April 1954 she was in series four of Educating Archie, while in December 1953 she also appeared in and directed Cinderella at the Players'; The Times commented that [...] "Miss Jacques as actress, playing a deliciously arch and <b>absent-minded</b> Fairy Queen, goes a long way to retrieve the failure of Miss Jacques as dramatist".|$|E
500|$|Despite being friends, she {{has driven}} Margaret to {{distraction}} on several occasions. Most notably in [...] "Only a Story", when {{she stayed with}} the Meldrews after her flat had been flooded and drove Margaret {{to the point of}} distraction with her complaining and laziness. Jean was also shown as a somewhat <b>absent-minded</b> character, as she has a pet cockatiel despite having a lifelong allergy to feathers. She would often bore the Meldrews by showing them her complete collection of holiday pictures at the most unwelcome times. A running joke is her beating Victor at board-games, including Trivial Pursuit and chess, while having a conversation with someone else. Doreen Mantle described her character as [...] "wanting {{to do the right thing}} but always finding out that it was the wrong thing".|$|E
500|$|In 1899, {{to benefit}} [...] "the wives and {{children}} of soldiers and sailors" [...] on active service in the Boer War, Sullivan composed the music of a jingoistic song, [...] "The <b>Absent-Minded</b> Beggar", to a text by Rudyard Kipling, which became an instant sensation and raised an unprecedented £250,000 from performances and the sale of sheet music and related merchandise. In The Rose of Persia (1899), Sullivan returned to his comic roots, writing to a libretto by Basil Hood that combined an exotic Arabian Nights setting with plot elements of The Mikado. Sullivan's tuneful score was well received, and the opera proved to be his most successful full-length collaboration apart from those with Gilbert. Another opera with Hood, The Emerald Isle, quickly went into preparation, but Sullivan died {{before it could be}} completed.|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} marks {{a departure}} from conventional and contemporary European epitaphs by placing the saints and mortal donor within the same pictorial space. Van der Paele kneels {{to the right of}} the Virgin and Child and seems a somewhat distracted and <b>absent-minded</b> figure. This is intentional, an indication that he is, in the words of art historian Bret Rothstein, [...] "disconnected from the perceptible world", and fully absorbed in the spiritual realm. This notion is reinforced by his glasses which, although they imply education, wealth and learning, also allude to fallibility of the human, earthly senses. In keeping with the conventions of late medieval art, van der Paele does not look directly at any of the heavenly figures, but stares into the middle distance, observing social and spiritual decorum.|$|E
500|$|In 1897, Sullivan {{had agreed}} to compose music for Kipling's poem Recessional, but he never {{completed}} the song. When asked to set [...] "The <b>Absent-Minded</b> Beggar" [...] to music two years later, Sullivan found Kipling's verses so difficult to set that he told his diary, [...] "if it wasn't for charity's sake, I could never have undertaken the task". Still, the experienced composer completed the music in four days, on 5 November 1899, and it was published by Enoch & Sons for the Daily Mail. The first public performance was sung by John Coates, under Sullivan's baton, at the Alhambra Theatre on 13 November 1899, to a [...] "magnificent reception" [...] of an overflowing theatre. In 1900, [...] "Kipling travelled to South Africa to help distribute the supplies bought with the funds raised by the song." ...|$|E
500|$|Alfred Meldrew (Richard Pearson) - Victor's <b>absent-minded</b> brother, {{who lives}} in New Zealand. During the episode [...] "The Broken Reflection", he comes to visit after 25 years, to the disdain of Victor. Alfred is an {{eccentric}} character, often walking around with his hat on fire, and bringing over his and Victor's great-grandfather's skull. He is a clumsy character too, mistaking the table-cloth for a napkin and dropping the entire contents of the table {{all over the floor}} when he stands up, and breaking a mirror {{in the middle of the}} night after mistaking his own reflection for a burglar. Victor starts to warm to Alfred towards the end of his visit, but Alfred leaves early the next day after finding an unpleasant message about him that Victor had accidentally recorded on a dictaphone. He is not seen again, but keeps in touch with the Meldrews, as Victor is seen looking at some photographs Alfred had sent over in [...] "The Trial".|$|E
500|$|Throughout his 1993 {{autobiography}} A World Elsewhere, Hordern exhibited {{his pride}} on {{being able to}} play a wide range of parts, something which made him a frequent subject among theatrical critics. The author Martin Banham thought that many of Hordern's characters shared a general identity of [...] "an <b>absent-minded,</b> good-hearted English eccentric". The American journalist Mel Gussow, writing in Hordern's obituary in The New York Times in 1995, described the actor as being [...] "a classical actor with the soul of a clown", while the actors John Hurt and Michael Bryant described Hordern as being [...] "the Austin Princess among British actors", which implied to the author Sheridan Morley that Hordern possessed an element of [...] "reliability but [...] a faint lack of charisma". Morley, who wrote Hordern's biography for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, went on to describe the actor as being [...] "one of the great eccentrics of his profession, perched perilously somewhere half way between Alistair Sim and Alec Guinness".|$|E
500|$|Percy {{took the}} land route across Boston Neck {{and over the}} Great Bridge, which some quick-thinking colonists had {{stripped}} of its planking to delay the British. [...] His men then came upon an <b>absent-minded</b> tutor at Harvard College and asked him which road would take them to Lexington. [...] The Harvard man, apparently oblivious {{to the reality of}} what was happening around him, showed him the proper road without thinking. [...] (He was later compelled to leave the country for inadvertently supporting the enemy.) [...] Percy's troops arrived in Lexington at about 2:00 p.m. [...] They could hear gunfire in the distance as they set up their cannon and deployed lines of regulars on high ground with commanding views of the town. [...] Colonel Smith's men approached like a fleeing mob with the full complement of colonial militia in close formation pursuing them. [...] Percy ordered his artillery to open fire at extreme range, dispersing the colonial militiamen. [...] Smith's men collapsed with exhaustion once they reached the safety of Percy's lines.|$|E
500|$|Professor Cuthbert Calculus (Professeur Tryphon Tournesol in Hergé's {{original}} version; tournesol is the French {{word for}} sunflower) is an <b>absent-minded</b> and partially-deaf physicist {{and a regular}} character alongside Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock. He was introduced in Red Rackham's Treasure, and based partially on , a Swiss physicist. The leading characters do not initially welcome his presence, but through his generous nature and his scientific ability, he develops a lasting bond with them. Eventually, {{by the end of}} Land of Black Gold, he becomes a resident of Marlinspike Hall. Normally mild-mannered and dignified, Calculus occasionally loses his temper and acts in a spectacularly aggressive manner in response to actual or perceived insults, such as when Captain Haddock belittles his work or accuses him of [...] "acting the goat". He is a fervent believer in dowsing, and carries a pendulum for that purpose. Calculus's deafness is a frequent source of humour, as he repeats back what he thinks he has heard, usually in the most unlikely words possible. He does not admit to being near-deaf and insists he is only [...] "a little hard of hearing in one ear." ...|$|E
500|$|Bianca Castafiore is {{an opera}} singer of whom Haddock is terrified. She was first {{introduced}} in King Ottokar's Sceptre and seems to appear wherever the protagonists travel, along with her maid Irma and pianist Igor Wagner. She is comically foolish, whimsical, <b>absent-minded,</b> and talkative, and seems unaware that her voice is shrill and appallingly loud. Her speciality is the Jewel Song ( [...] / Ah! My beauty past compare, [...] these jewels bright I wear) from [...] opera, Faust, which she sings at the least provocation, much to Haddock's dismay. She is often maternal toward Haddock, of whose dislike she remains ignorant. She often confuses words, especially names, with other words that rhyme with them or of which they remind her; [...] "Haddock" [...] is frequently replaced by malapropisms such as [...] "Paddock", [...] "Stopcock", or [...] "Hopscotch", while Nestor, Haddock's butler, is confused with [...] "Chestor" [...] and [...] "Hector". Her own name means [...] "white and chaste flower": a meaning to which Professor Calculus once refers when he breeds a white rose and names it for the singer. She was based upon opera divas in general (according to Hergé's perception), Hergé's Aunt Ninie (who was known for her [...] "shrill" [...] singing of opera), and, in the post-war comics, on Maria Callas.|$|E
500|$|The Daily Mail proprietor, Alfred Harmsworth, publicised {{efforts to}} help {{soldiers}} and their families. This drew the attention of Rudyard Kipling, who produced [...] "The <b>Absent-Minded</b> Beggar" [...] on 16 October 1899 and sent the verses to Harmsworth on 22 October with a note that [...] "they are at your service. ... turn [...] over {{to any one of}} the regularly ordained relief-funds, as a portion of your contribution. I don't want my name mixed up in the business except as it will help to get money. It's catchpenny verse and I want it to catch just as many pennies as it can. ... It isn't a thing I shall care to reprint; so there is no need of copyrighting it in America. If any one wants to sing it take care that the proceeds go to our men." [...] It was first published in the Daily Mail on 31 October 1899 and was an immediate success. Maud Tree, the wife of actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree, recited it at the Palace Theatre, every night before the show, for fourteen months, and other performers recited it at music halls and elsewhere, giving part of the profits to the fund. The manuscript itself was auctioned for £500, and a Special Edition de Luxe was issued.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of his death Gronlund was remembered {{critically}} but warmly in the American socialist press. Writing in the Social Democratic Herald, Secretary of the Social Democratic Party of America Seymour Stedman remembered him as a proverbial <b>absent-minded</b> professor: ...|$|E
2500|$|Moving to New York in 1950, he edited Dell Publishing's cartoon {{magazines}} (1000 Jokes, Ballyhoo, For Laughing Out Loud) and Dell's paperback cartoon collections, such as Forever Funny (1956). His {{comic strip}} about an <b>absent-minded</b> professor, Professor Phumble, was carried by King Features from 1960 to 1978. (In Brazil {{during the early}} 1960s, Professor Phumble was published as Zé Fiasco in the Correio da Manhã newspaper. But his more famous Brazilian nickname is the one used by the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper, Professor Tantã.) ...|$|E
2500|$|After this event, he lost {{interest}} in school studies, friends, and relations. He was <b>absent-minded</b> at school, [...] "imagining and expecting God would suddenly drop down from Heaven before me". Avoiding company, he preferred to sit alone, absorbed in concentration on this current or force, and went daily to the Meenakshi Temple, ecstatically devoted to {{the images of the}} 63 Nayanars and of Nataraja, wanting [...] "the same grace as was shown to those saints," [...] praying that he [...] "should have the same bhakti that they had" [...] and [...] " [...] that God should give me the same grace He gave to those saints".|$|E
