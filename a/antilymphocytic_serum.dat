40|$|A {{report is}} {{delivered}} on the First International Congress of the Transplantation Society (Paris 1967). The recent interest in transplantation of organs is {{largely due to}} the technical advances in surgical procedures making it possible to replace organs in the human, as well as to an increased understanding of the basic biological problems underlying the rejection of such grafts. At this first International Congress, widely ranging topics were discussed, including organ transplantation, mechanism of graft rejection, methods of immunosuppression, genetics of transplantation, bone marrow transplantation, and cancer as homograft. New techniques of organ transplantation, new concepts in the antigenic structure of cells, new methods of purifying subcellular fraction of <b>antilymphocytic</b> <b>serum,</b> new drugs to combat rejection phenomena, and above all a fresh outlook on the mode of action of these drugs at a molecular level, will doubtless render this an exciting new approach to biology in general and to clinical problems in particular. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|To {{ascertain}} {{the effects of}} selective impairment of the fixed macrophage compartment on host defense, rabbit anti-rat Kupffer cell serum was raised and tested {{for its ability to}} depress phagocytosis and to serve as an immunosuppressant. The ability of the anti-Kupffer cell serum (AKS) to depress intravascular clearance rates of gelatinized RE test lipid emulsion indicated that the antiserum can functionally impair overt phagocytic activity. The phagocytic impairment was manifested by a significantly decreased liver phagocytosis of the lipid emulsion, whereas only a slight decrease in phagocytosis by the spleen was noted. When titered in vitro, AKS was cytotoxic to hepatic and splenic macrophages. Although AKS induced some degree of immunosuppressive activity, it was not as effective as <b>antilymphocytic</b> <b>serum</b> in suppressing the humoral immune response of rats to sheep red blood cells. Selectivity in the cytotoxic activity of AKS was manifested by toxicity for macrophages but not toxicity for thymocytes or splenic lymphocytes.

40|$|Friend {{murine leukemia}} virus, which induces {{malignant}} erythropoiesis in mice, {{is a complex}} containing spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) I and lymphatic leukemia virus (LLV-F) (1). SFFV is defective and is dependent upon its associated helper, LLV-F, which supplies type-specific virus envelope antigen (2, 3). At least two genes determine the host response to Friend leukemia virus (FV) complex. The Fv- 1 gene controls host resistance to LLV-F {{and appears to be}} identical to the N-B locus conferring resistance to XC plaque formation in embryo cells by murine leukemia virus (4). The Fv- 2 gene controls susceptibility to SFFV. Mice homozygous for resistance (Fv- 2 Tr), including those of strains C 57 BL and C 58, are completely resistant to splenomegaly and erythroblastosis induced by most strains of the FV complex (SFFV [LLV-F]) (5). Such "resistant " mice are also refractory to the extremely suppressive effect of the FV complex on antibody formation (6), but remain sensitive to the moderate and transient suppression induced by LLV alone (1).

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that treatment with <b>antilymphocytic</b> <b>serum</b> (ALS) can provoke latent virus infections has been investigated. In adult mice infections with sublethal doses of LCM virus usually {{result in the}} development of immunity to the virus {{and at the same time}} to a prolonged latent infection. In the experiments described an intensive treatment with large doses of ALS was given to mice which had recovered from LCM virus infection. At the beginning of the treatment the mice had high titers of complement-fixing antibodies in their blood and no detectable virus. The data presented show that in spite of the immunity the ALS treatment provoked the occult virus and led to the development of viremia in all the treated mice. In some, very high virus titers were demonstrable. When the ALS treatment was discontinued the viremia disappeard again. In most of the mice the ALS did not suppress the complement-fixing antibody titers and in some there was even a considerable increase in titer. In such cases the increases in virus titers and in antibody titers were closely related to one another. These results demonstrate once again that the complement-fixing antibodies to the LCM virus in mice probably do not influence the virus...|$|E
40|$|In 1958 Francis Moore {{described}} the orthotopic liver transplantation technique in dogs. In 1963, Starzl et al. performed the first liver transplantation.

In 1967, stimulated by Calne who used <b>antilymphocytic</b> <b>serum,</b> Starzl began a successful series of liver transplantation. Until 1977, 200 liver transplantations were performed in the world. In that period, technical problems were overcome. Roy Calne, in 1979, used the first time cyclosporine in two patients who had undergone liver transplantation. In 1989, Starzl et al. reported a series of 1, 179 consecutives patients who underwent liver transplantation and reported a survival rate between one and five years of 73 % and 64 %, respectively. Finally, in 1990, Starzl et al. reported successful use of tacrolimus in patents undergoing liver transplantation and who had rejection despite receiving conventional immunosuppressive treatment. Liver Transplantation Program was initiated at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in 1990 and so far over 1, 400 transplants have been done. In 2013, 102 deceased donors liver transplantations were performed. The main indications for transplantation were hepatocellular carcinoma (38 %), hepatitis C virus (33. 3 %) and alcohol liver cirrhosis (19. 6 %). Of these, 36 % of patients who underwent transplantation showed biological MELD score > 30. Patient and graft survival {{in the first year}} was, 82. 4 % and 74. 8 %, respectively.

40|$|<b>Antilymphocytic</b> <b>serum</b> (ALS) is {{now known}} to have a {{pronounced}} immunosuppressive effect on animals into which it is injected (1 - 4). In certain experiments during prolonged treatment with ALS in dogs and monkeys some animals have died with symptoms of acute viral infections (3, 5). It has been suggested (6) that these infections were caused by a provocation of occult viruses brought about by abolition of an antiviral immunity in the hosts. However, direct experimental data supporting such a theory have hitherto been lacking. The {{question of whether it}} is possible to provoke latent virus infections by a suppression of the immune mechanism of the host obviously has both theoretical and practical implications. It would therefore seem necessary to investigate the matter. The mouse-lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus system is ideal for this purpose. After recovery from an LCM virus infection of adult mice the virus often persists in the mice for a long time, probably {{for the rest of the}} life of the animals (7). 1 The mice are perfectly healthy, have moderate high titers of complement-fixing antibodies, and are immune against reinfection. In spite of this, trace amounts of virus may occasionally be found in the blood and moreover in certain organs, such as the kidneys, the presence of virus can be demonstrated regularly a year or more after the infection. A perfect balance between the LCM virus and its host seems therefore to have been established. It is the purpose of this report to present data which show that prolonged treatment with ALS can tip such a balance in favor of the virus and provoke a viremia with high titers of virus. No correlation between the titers of complement-fixing antibodies and the blood virus titers has, however, been demonstrated. *The Institute of Tumour Virus Research is supported by grants from the "Eina...|$|E
40|$|Antiserum {{raised in}} one species against lymphoid cells of another (beterologons antilymphocyte serum, ALS) exerts {{powerful}} immunosuppressive effects when injected into {{members of the}} lymphoid donor species (8, 20, 34). Despite intensive investigation there is yet no clear agreement concerning the mechanism of this immtmosuppression. Various possibilities have been summaxized by Levey and Medawar (20). All workers are agreed that the administration of ALS causes widespread changes in lymphoid tissues; however, the type and magnitude of the changes reported have been variable and often conflicting. Some studies have emphasized generalized lymphoid depletion following ALS treatment (8, 25) while others have noted discrete lymphoid tissue lesions (27, 31) or lymphoid hyperplasia (2, 12, 20). Similarly, {{the correlation between the}} degree of immunosuppression and lymphopenia obtained by some workers (8) was not noted by others (14). The determination of the histologic features that are invariably linked with immunosuppression by ALS would be helpful in clarifying its mode of action. Toxic effects of ALS have been noted, particularly on red blood cells and on glomerular capillaries (10, 12, 16). It would be helpful to learn whether these effects are due to antibodies irrelevant to the immunosuppressive activity of ALS. It would also be important to characterize other possible toxic consequences of ALS and the relation of their pathogenesis to the desired immunosuppressive effects. Materials and Methods M/ce.
