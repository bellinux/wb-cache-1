25|$|Dexfenfluramine {{inhibits}} serotonin reuptake, {{stimulating the}} release of serotonin. In 1996, dexfenfluramine became the first long-term treatment anti-obesity medication approved in the US; <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> <b>observed</b> during clinical trials included dry mouth, diarrhea and drowsiness. In the mid-1990s the US FDA approved dexfenfluramine as a weight loss drug. After several reports of adverse cardiovascular effects, the FDA banned dexfenfluramine in 1997.|$|E

50|$|Lumateperone, at {{a dose of}} 60 mg per day, was {{not found}} to be {{associated}} with any statistically significant treatment-emergent side effects relative to placebo. At a dose of 120 mg daily, the most frequent <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> <b>observed</b> was sedation/somnolence, reported by 32.5% of patients. There was no evidence of extrapyramidal symptoms or increase in suicidal ideation or behavior.|$|R
50|$|Safety {{pharmacology}} {{studies have}} to be designed for defining the dose-response relationship of the <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> <b>observed.</b> Justification should be provided for {{the selection of the}} particular animal model or test system. The time course (e.g., onset and duration of response) of the <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> is investigated through selected time points for the measurements based on pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic considerations. Generally, the doses eliciting the <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> {{have to be}} compared to the doses eliciting the primary pharmacodynamic effect in the test species or the proposed therapeutic effect in humans.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} {{selected}} antemortem stressors on postmortem muscle quality {{was determined by}} measurement of isometric tension, muscle glycogen, pH, ATP and shear value. Heat stress hastened the rate of postmortem glycolysis (as indicated by isometric tension development) while the cold and non-specific commercial handling stresses lengthened the period of postmortem glycolysis. The only <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> <b>observed</b> {{during the course of}} these studies was a slight toughening in broilers held at 2 ° C. for 2 hours prior to slaughter...|$|R
50|$|Common <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> <b>observed</b> in cobimetinib and vemurafinib co-treated {{persons in}} {{clinical}} trials included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, rash, photosensitivity, and pyrexia.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>adverse</b> <b>effects,</b> <b>observed</b> {{in more than}} 10% of patients, include {{headache}} and a running or obstructed nose. Diarrhea and vomiting are also relatively common, seen in at least 1% of patients.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> <b>observed</b> with lopinavir/ritonavir are {{diarrhea}} and nausea. In key clinical trials, moderate or severe diarrhea occurred {{in up to}} 27% of patients, and moderate/severe nausea in up to 16%. Other common adverse effects include abdominal pain, asthenia, headache, vomiting and, particularly in children, rash.|$|E
30|$|Conclusions: No <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were <b>observed</b> {{with the}} use of OXIRIS®, neither during CPB nor after 24  hours of surgery. Therefore, the use of an {{increased}} adsorption membrane connected to CPB is safe and feasible.|$|R
30|$|This is {{the first}} study {{reporting}} the feasibility of an alternative, individualized, physiology-based open-lung HFOV strategy targeting high F and high ∆Pproximal. No <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were <b>observed</b> with this strategy. Our findings warrant further systematic evaluation.|$|R
30|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} that significant <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were <b>observed</b> in neither study group, including pain on injecting local anesthesia, nor postoperative nausea and vomiting {{which can be}} attributed to the small dose of fentanyl used.|$|R
50|$|Alitretinoin {{is a form}} {{of vitamin}} A. Alitretinoin has been {{administered}} in oncological clinical studies at dosages of more than 10-times of the therapeutic dosage given for chronic hand eczema. The <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> <b>observed</b> were consistent with retinoid toxicity, and included severe headache, diarrhoea, facial flushing and hypertriglyceridemia. These effects were reversible.|$|E
50|$|The MARS International Registry, {{with data}} from more than 500 {{patients}} (although sponsored by the manufacturer), shows that the <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> <b>observed</b> {{are similar to the}} control group. However, in these severely ill patients it is difficult to distinguish between complications of the disease itself and side effects attributable to the technique.|$|E
50|$|Dexfenfluramine {{inhibits}} serotonin reuptake, {{stimulating the}} release of serotonin. In 1996, dexfenfluramine became the first long-term treatment anti-obesity medication approved in the US; <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> <b>observed</b> during clinical trials included dry mouth, diarrhea and drowsiness.

30|$|Methods: This is a {{pilot study}} that {{included}} 20 cardiac surgery patients. Ten patients were assigned to receive CPB[*]+[*]OXIRIS® during cardiac surgery and 10 patients were assigned to receive standard CPB. Blood samples were collected and clinical variables were recorded (just before connection to CPB (T 0), just before ending CPB (T 1), at intensive care unit (ICU) admission (T 2), and 24  hours after ICU admission (T 3)). Clinical variables were registered from CPB and up to 24  hours from ICU admission, including any <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> <b>observed</b> during the use of OXIRIS® membrane.|$|R
50|$|No treatment-related <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were <b>observed</b> in an oral {{toxicity}} {{study in}} rats of a standardized hydroethanolic extract of S. tortuosum. The extract, although not mesembrine itself, produced ataxia in rats, thereby possibly limiting {{the usefulness of}} the extract as an antidepressant.|$|R
50|$|In a {{preliminary}} clinical trial of semapimod {{in patients with}} moderate to severe Crohn's disease, positive clinical changes were observed, including endoscopic improvement, positive responses in some patients not responding to infliximab, healing of fistulae, and indications for tapering of steroids; no significant <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were <b>observed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cefodizime {{has been}} shown to be {{generally}} well tolerated in drug trials and its adverse effects are mainly gastrointestinal or dermatological. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were observed in 2.4% of patients during clinical trials and included: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and elevated transaminases. Allergic symptoms were observed in 1.1% of patients and include: exanthema, urticaria, and pruritus. Other <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> <b>observed</b> include local site reactions, pain at site of injection, and phlebitis.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, it is {{recommended}} that patients be administered antipyretics before use. According to Aldurazyme's website, the most common <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> <b>observed</b> in a 26-week, placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients 6 years old or older are flushing, pyrexia, headache, and rash. Flushing was noted in 23% of patients, or five people, in this relatively small clinical study. This trial was extended. In the extension, it was noted that abdominal pain and infusion-site reaction occurred in some patients.|$|E
50|$|Since {{biological}} perturbation {{depends on}} {{concentration of the}} toxicant as well as exposure duration of a candidate drug (parent molecule or metabolites) at that target site, in vivo tissue and organ effects can either be completely different or similar to those observed in vitro.Therefore, extrapolating <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> <b>observed</b> in vitro is incorporated into a quantitative model of in vivo PK model. It is generally accepted that physiologically based PK (PBPK) models, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of any given chemical are central to in vitro - in vivo extrapolations.|$|E
5000|$|Regulatory {{controls}} should {{incorporate a}} margin of safety; activities should be limited below {{the level at which}} no <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> has been <b>observed</b> or predicted (Margin of Safety PP).|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a case of}} giant congenital melanocytic nevus with placental villous involvement in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy. Only four similar cases {{have been reported in}} the world literature. Nevomelanocytes were found in both villous stoma and fetal capillaries. No neonatal or maternal <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were <b>observed</b> 5 years after diagnosis in the present case...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} spinal level marking {{applicable}} particularly {{for use in}} thoracolumbar posterior spinal operations is described. The use of patent blue V dye in this procedure is discussed in a consecutive series of over 100 cases. No serious <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were <b>observed.</b> The technique ensures accurate identification of spinal marking and helps to minimize anaesthetic time...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> <b>observed</b> in {{clinical}} trials were upper respiratory tract infections (more than 10% of patients), nasopharyngitis (common cold), headache, {{and high blood pressure}} (at least 5%). The enzyme alanine transaminase was also elevated in at least 5% of patients, but in most cases without symptoms. Elevated total cholesterol levels were common. [...] Among the less common side effects were dizziness, various infections, as well as reactions of the skin and mucosae like mild rashes, gastritis and mouth ulcer. Rare but severe reactions were gastrointestinal perforations (0.26% in six months) and anaphylaxis (0.2%).|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other KOR agonists, nalfurafine {{does not}} produce hallucinogenic effects in humans. Single {{intramuscular}} injections of up to 30 µg are well-tolerated by humans, whereas a dose of 40 µg produced [...] "moderate behavioral/psychological side effects" [...] (possibly referring to sedation), though apparently did not produce any psychotomimetic or dysphoric effects. In rodents, a low dose of nalfurafine (10-40 µg/kg) was found not to produce conditioned place preference or aversion, though a high dose (80 µg/kg) did induce significant place aversion. The most common side effect of low-dose nalfurafine seen in clinical trials was insomnia (observed in 10-15% of patients), with few other <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> <b>observed.</b> In addition, tolerance to the antipruritic effects of nalfurafine was not found after treatment of patients with the drug for one year, and nalfurafine has shown no evidence of either physical nor psychological dependence in humans. The drug also shows lower evidence of tolerance for effects such as analgesia and sedation in animals relative to other KOR agonists. In animals, nalfurafine produces anti-scratch, antinociceptive, sedative, and diuretic effects.|$|E
40|$|The risk of {{hypoglycemia}} with sulfonylureas {{is higher}} {{in the presence of}} diabetic nephropathy. Selective DPP- 4 inhibitors lead to physiologic increases in the incretins GLP- 1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide and preferable for the management of postprandial hyperglycemia due to lack of many <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> <b>observed</b> with other diabetes medications...|$|E
50|$|Bayer CropScience {{studies show}} that the maximum dose of {{imidacloprid}} for which no <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were <b>observed</b> in bees is 20 ppb. Since Bayer claims that residue levels are usually below 5 ppb in pollen and nectar, they contend that imidacloprid poses a negligible risk to bees. Nevertheless, Armengaud et al observed that imidacloprid 10-8M decreased bee brain metabolism.|$|R
30|$|In the ERA practice, it {{will not}} be {{possible}} to assess the exact type and extent of the <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> that the novel management and cultivation practices associated with herbicide-tolerant GMO cultivation may have. Nevertheless, the formulation of LoCs will be needed also for these types of effects [see also 18]. Risk management measures and a well-designed post-market environmental monitoring are needed in order to evaluate whether any LoC for long-term effects are exceeded during cultivation. The efficacy of specific risk management measures (e.g. weed resistance management measures) needs to be evaluated at least during the post-market monitoring period, usually 10  years after consent, and ideally longer. Any <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> <b>observed</b> during the post-market monitoring period (e.g. the occurrence of resistant weed species) needs to be scrutinised whether it has been caused by the cultivation of the respective GMO and whether it falls within the defined LoCs.|$|R
50|$|Gangrene, phlebitis, {{thrombosis}} (blood clots), pneumonia, meningitis, septicaemia (blood infection), osteomyelitis (bone infection), {{liver and}} kidney damage, brain damage and HIV/AIDS are common serious <b>adverse</b> health <b>effects</b> <b>observed</b> among users of krokodil. Sometimes, the user will miss the vein when injecting the desomorphine, creating an abscess and causing death of the flesh surrounding the entry-point.|$|R
40|$|The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association {{administered}} a survey {{to capture the}} clinical experiences of small animal veterinarians regarding <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> <b>observed</b> in cats and dogs following the use of flea and tick control pesticide products.

40|$|A dual-pharmacophoric peptide was {{engineered}} by grafting the integrin binding RGD motif between the C- and N-termini of a disulfide-rich noradrenaline transporter inhibiting χ-conotoxin {{resulting in a}} stable backbone cyclized peptide. The construct maintained two independent biological activities and showed increased plasma stability with no <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> <b>observed</b> following administration to rats, highlighting the potential value of pharmacophore grafting into constrained peptide scaffolds...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{the effect of a}} mast cell stabiliser, the {{magnesium}} salt of N-acetyl aspartyl glutamic acid (NAAGA) on allergen-induced immediate bronchoconstriction in 12 atopic subjects. Inhaled NAAGA, at a dose of 60 mg thrice daily for 1 week, offered no protective effect on the airways against allergen challenge when compared with a matched placebo. The drug was well tolerated with no <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> <b>observed...</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2000 the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences set a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of 2,000 mg/day. The amount {{was chosen}} because human trials had {{reported}} diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disturbances at intakes of greater than 3,000 mg/day. This was the Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (LOAEL), meaning that other <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were <b>observed</b> at higher intakes.|$|R
40|$|Hochu-ekki-to was {{administered}} orally in 2. 5 g doses thrice per day to 53 patients who complained of lumbago or lower abdominal discomfort. Its efficacy rate was 53. 8 % for {{the patients who}} complained of lumbago, and 32. 3 % for the patients who complained of lower abdominal discomfort. Total efficacy rate was 66. 0 %.

40|$|The median {{effective}} dosage (ED 50) for induction of anesthesia with propofol {{was determined}} by using the up-and-down method in 31 unpremedicated cats, in 30 cats premedicated with butorphanol, 0. 4 mg/kg body weight (BW), and acepromazine, 0. 1 mg/kg BW, intramuscularly, and in 30 cats premedicated with morphine, 0. 2 mg/kg BW, and acepromazine, 0. 1 mg/kg BW, intramuscularly. The dose required for a satisfactory anesthetic induction in 50 % of unpremedicated cats (ED 50) was 7. 22 mg/kg BW and of premedicated cats was 5. 00 mg/kg BW. The reduction in dose was statistically significant in both premedicated groups compared with no premedication. There {{was no significant difference}} in ED 50 between premedication regimes.
