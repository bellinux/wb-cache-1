5|$|The Easter Rising of 1916 {{was carried}} out by the latter group {{together}} with a smaller socialist militia, the Irish Citizen Army. The British response, executing fifteen leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>people,</b> turned the mood of the country in favour of the rebels. Support for Irish republicanism increased further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the Conscription Crisis of 1918.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{study to}} date {{followed}} over <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>people</b> for eight years; it showed an 87% {{increased risk of}} death compared to the normal population. Predictors of higher risk were: female sex, absence of treatment for sex hormone deficiency, younger age {{at the time of}} diagnosis, and a diagnosis of craniopharyngioma. Apart from cardiovascular disease, this study also showed an increased risk of death from lung disease.|$|E

5|$|Significant clashes {{from this}} period {{included}} the siege of Kijevo, where over <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>people</b> were besieged in the inner Dalmatian village of Kijevo, and the Borovo Selo killings, where Croatian policemen engaged Serb paramilitaries in the eastern Slavonian village of Borovo and suffered twelve casualties. Violence gripped eastern Slavonian villages: in Tovarnik, a Croat policeman was killed by Serb paramilitaries on 2 May, while in Sotin, a Serb civilian was killed on 5 May when he {{was caught in a}} crossfire between Serb and Croat paramilitaries. On 6 May, the 1991 protest in Split against the siege of Kijevo at the Navy Command in Split resulted in the death of a Yugoslav People's Army soldier.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{rates in}} Germany {{increased}} {{as the war}} drew to a close, particularly {{in areas where the}} Red Army was advancing. More than <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>people</b> (out of a population of around 16,000) committed suicide in Demmin on and around 1 May 1945 as the 65th Army of 2nd Belorussian Front first broke into a distillery and then rampaged through the town, committing mass rapes, arbitrarily executing civilians and setting fire to buildings. High numbers of suicides took place in many other locations, including Neubrandenburg (600 dead), Stolp in Pommern (1,000 dead) and Berlin, where at least 7,057 people committed suicide in 1945.|$|E
5|$|By 1989, {{the belief}} had spread outside the Cajun area. Hundreds {{of people were}} visiting Richard's grave each week, which had been {{illuminated}} so visits could occur {{in the evening and}} a box had been provided in which to leave written petitions to Richard. On the thirtieth anniversary of her death that year, an outdoor mass was held there which was attended by four thousand people and which was covered by Louisiana television stations and the Cable News Network, and was reported in newspapers in Louisiana, Dallas, Houston, Miami, Orlando, Albany, and Seattle. The media coverage resulted in knowledge of Richard spreading world-wide, with interest in her expressed in Yugoslavia, Croatia, Australia, and Africa. Approximately <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>people</b> attended anniversary masses there in both 1991 and 1999, with about 400 attending in 2007, and thousands come to her grave each year, including chartered buses from New Orleans.|$|E

5|$|In September 1937 Stalin {{dispatched}} Mikoyan, {{along with}} Georgy Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria, {{with a list}} of 300 names to Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR), to oversee the liquidation of the Communist Party of Armenia (CPA), which was largely made up of Old Bolsheviks. Mikoyan tried, but failed, to save one from being executed during his trip to Armenia. That person was arrested during one of his speeches to the CPA by Beria. Over <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>people</b> were arrested and seven of nine members of the Armenian Politburo were sacked from office. In several instances, he intervened on behalf of his colleagues; this leniency towards the persecuted may have been one reason why he was selected by Stalin to oversee the purges in the ASSR.|$|E
5|$|The {{job market}} is {{knowledge}} and service based {{and the largest}} employment sectors are healthcare and social services, trade, education, consulting, research, industry and telecommunications. The municipality has more high and middle income jobs, and fewer low income jobs, than the national average. Today {{the majority of the}} largest companies in the municipality are in the sectors of trade, transport and media. The wind power industry has strong roots in Aarhus, and the larger region of Midtjylland, and nationally most of the revenue in the industry is generated by companies in the greater Aarhus area. The wind industry employs about <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>people</b> within the municipality making it a central component in the local economy. The biotech industry is well established in the city with many small and medium-sized companies mainly focused on research and development.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1970s, Glenmalure Park {{regularly}} hosted attendances in {{the region}} of 20,000 people, but as the majority of the Irish public turned its back on Irish football, those numbers declined and despite winning the League of Ireland four times in succession in the 1980s, the attendances for the period averaged approximately a quarter of that figure. The sale of the stadium contributed to a further decline in support. During the homeless years, particularly those spent on the Northside, attendances continued to fall with the exception of those recorded during the club's residence at the RDS, which included an opening attendance of 22,000. Prior to the relocation to Tallaght, the club's support base had been reduced to a hardcore group of over <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>people.</b> It currently includes approximately 2,700 season ticket holders.|$|E

5|$|Alfons√≠n died {{at home on}} 31March 2009, {{at the age of}} 82, {{after being}} {{diagnosed}} a year before with lung cancer. The streets around his house at the Santa Fe avenue were filled with hundreds of people, who started a candlelight vigil. The radical Julio Cobos, Fern√°ndez de Kirchner's vice president, was the acting president at the moment and ordered three days of national mourning. There was a ceremony in the Congress, where his body was displayed in the Blue Hall, that was attended by almost <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>people.</b> His widow Mar√≠a Lorenza Barreneche could not attend the funeral, because of her own poor health. It was attended by former presidents Carlos Menem, Fernando delaR√∫a, Eduardo Duhalde and N√©stor Kirchner, {{all the members of the}} Supreme Court of Argentina, mayor Mauricio Macri, governor Daniel Scioli, the president of Uruguay Tabar√© V√°zquez and several other politicians. The coffin was moved to La Recoleta Cemetery. He was placed next to the graves of other important historical figures of the UCR, such as Leandro N. Alem, Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen and Arturo Illia.|$|E
5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>people</b> would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E
5|$|He {{gained a}} Second Class {{in the first}} History Tripos in 1909, and won the English Essay Prize with an essay on {{political}} satire in English poetry. He won the same prize again in 1910, and that year gained first-class honours in his Theological Special Examination. By this point, he was having doubts about his future as a minister and consulted with the university Law Reader as {{to the possibility of}} a career as a barrister. On the Reader's advice, Birkett took the second Law Tripos in 1911, passing with second-class honours. Birkett interviewed with the editors of The Guardian and The Observer in his search for a job to sustain him while he took the bar exam. He took a job as personal secretary to George Cadbury Junior, with a wage of ¬£200 a year, which he planned to hold until he qualified as a barrister. After only a month of working for Cadbury, his salary was raised to ¬£500, and he was offered a permanent position. While there, he continued his political work and spoke on behalf of the Liberal Party, cementing his reputation as an effective speaker by, on one occasion, holding the attention of more than <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>people</b> for an hour. He took {{the first part of the}} Bar Examination in 1912, but failed the paper on real property; he passed it on his second attempt, and was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple on 4 June 1913.|$|E
