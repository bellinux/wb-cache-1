Near {{the end of that}} same century, Charles Bernstein declared that poetry should <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> interesting as TV. The start of a new century brings with it a new demand for poetry: poetry must <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> witty, as knowing and as surprising as Created in Darkness by Troubled Americans. And, though it may not seem so at first, this silly—and disturbing, and wonderful—book offers serious lessons for and challenges to contemporary American poetry at all levels: from individual poem to overarching theory.

40|$|The {{security}} of cascade ciphers, in which by definition the keys of the component ciphers are independent, is considered. It {{is shown by}} a counterexample that the intuitive result, formally stated and proved in the literature, that a cascade <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> strong as the strongest component cipher, requires the uninterestingly restrictive assumption that the enemy cannot exploit information about the plaintext statistics. It is proved, for very general notions of breaking a cipher and of problem difficulty, that a cascade <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> difficult to break as the first component cipher. A consequence of this result is that, if the ciphers commute, then a cascade <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> difficult to break as the most-difficult-tobreak component cipher, i. e., the intuition that a cryptographic chain <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> strong as its strongest link is then provably correct. It is noted that additive stream ciphers do commute, and this fact is used to suggest a strategy for designing secure practical ci [...] ...|$|R

Therocephalians <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> ancient as a third large branch of therapsids, the gorgonopsids, which they resemble in many primitive features. For example, many early therocephalians possess long canine teeth {{similar to those of}} gorgonopsids. The therocephalians, however, outlasted the gorgonopsids, persisting into the early-Middle Triassic period.|$|E

25|$|In {{answer to}} Kingsley, again {{encouraged}} by Badeley, Newman published in bi-monthly parts his Apologia Pro Vita Sua, a religious autobiography of abiding interest. Its tone changed the popular estimate of its author, by explaining the convictions which {{had led him}} into the Catholic Church. Kingsley's general accusation against the Catholic clergy is dealt with later in the work; his specific accusations are addressed in an appendix. Newman maintains that English Catholic priests <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> truthful as English Catholic laymen. Newman published a revision of the series of pamphlets in book form in 1865; in 1913 a combined critical edition, edited by Wilfrid Ward, was published.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's songwriting ability {{improved}} {{throughout the}} Beatles' career, but his material did not earn full respect from Lennon, McCartney and producer George Martin until near the group's break-up. In 1969, McCartney told Lennon: [...] "Until this year, our songs {{have been better}} than George's. Now this year his songs <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> good as ours". Harrison often had difficulty getting the band to record his songs. Most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contain at least two Harrison compositions; three of his songs appear on Revolver, [...] "the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter", according to Inglis.|$|E

These schemes <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> corrosive of the governmental process as corruption at the federal level. From the time of Tammany Hall this country has been painfully aware of the existence of corrupt practices in many of our metropolitan areas, and of the [...] "machines" [...] and [...] "rings" [...] which siphon off millions of dollars from public treasuries for private gain. Most state and local prosecutors, beset by inadequate resources and the overwhelming demands of a rising rate of street crime, are simply unable to deal with this type of corruption. Moreover, in some cases, local law enforcement is part and parcel of the problem itself, due to the outright corruption of its own establishment.|$|E

500|$|Biographical readings, {{in which}} critics {{would try to}} connect {{passages}} in the plays and sonnets to specific events in Shakespeare's life, <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> old as the Romantic Period. Many famous writers, scholars, and critics from the 18th to the early 20th century pondered the connection between Hamnet's death and Shakespeare's plays. These scholars and critics included Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Edward Dowden, and Dover Wilson, among others. In 1931, C. J. Sisson stated that such interpretations had [...] "gone too far". In 1934, Shakespeare scholar R. W. Chambers agreed, saying that Shakespeare's most cheerful work was written after his son's death, making a connection doubtful. In the mid-to-late 20th century, it became increasingly unpopular for critics to connect events in authors' lives with their work, not just for Shakespeare, but for all writing. More recently, however, as {{the ideas of the}} New Criticism have lost prominence, biographical interpretations of Hamnet's relationship to his father's work have begun to re-emerge.|$|E

2500|$|Mainstream {{economic}} theory relies upon [...] quantitative economic models, which employ {{a variety of}} concepts.

The mallet dampening techniques [...] "are to the vibist as garlic and fresh basil are to the Northern Italian chef" [...] and contribute significantly to expressive four-mallet playing.|$|E
2500|$|The Peninsula's {{vegetation}} types {{form part}} of the Cape Floral Region protected areas. These protected areas are a World Heritage Site, and an estimated 2,200 species of plants are confined to Table Mountain range - which <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> many as occur {{in the whole of}} the United Kingdom. Many of these species, including a great many types of proteas, are endemic to these mountains and can be found nowhere else. The Disa uniflora, despite its restricted range within the Western Cape, is relatively common in the perennially wet areas (waterfalls, streamlets and seeps) on Table Mountain and the Back Table, but hardly anywhere else on the Cape Peninsula. It is a very showy orchid that blooms from January to March on the Table Mountain Sandstone regions of the mountain. Although they are quite widespread on the Back Table, the best (most certain, and close-up) place to view these beautiful blooms is in the [...] "Aqueduct" [...] off the Smuts Track, halfway between Skeleton Gorge and Maclear's Beacon.|$|E
2500|$|John Constable made {{extensive}} use of sketches for his landscapes, both of intimate scale, often in a sketchbook on paper, and in full-scale sketches for his largest [...] "six-footers", which he used to refine his compositions. [...] Delacroix, Géricault, Manet and Degas are other artists who often used them. For some oil sketches Degas painted in essence, a technique by which the oil had been all but removed from the pigment, so that the artist was virtually drawing with pure paint. Seurat made many careful small oil sketches for his larger works. However, {{with the advent of}} Impressionism, and then Modernism, the practice of preparatory drawing and painting tended to decline. The abandonment by many artists of a high level of detail and finish in favor of a more painterly and spontaneous approach, reduced the distinction between a detailed sketch and a finished painting. [...] Sketches by Rubens or Tiepolo, for example, <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> highly finished as many 20th century oil paintings. [...] Many artists, especially those working in more traditional styles, still use oil sketches today. [...] Francis Bacon is an example of an artist who called many of his most important, and largest, finished works [...] "studies": examples are his Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion Tate Britain, or his Study from Pope Innocent X, auctioned in 2007 for $52.7 million.|$|E
