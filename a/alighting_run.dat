60|$|The next place, {{a village}} of perhaps twenty or thirty houses {{and half a dozen}} stores, was soon reached. There was a small tavern, and they drove up to this. <b>Alighting,</b> Matt <b>ran</b> inside and {{questioned}} the half a score of loungers concerning the auction wagon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I {{only heard}} a little tinkling of the chandeliers," [...] {{said one of}} the ladies. [...] "Is it such a very <b>alight</b> matter to <b>run</b> down another boat and sink it?" ...|$|R
50|$|At 9:45 am on 9 September 1942 at Ballyboden, Rathfarnham, County Dublin, O'Brien {{left his}} house and began getting into his car. As was {{customary}} among Gardaí, Detective Sergeant O'Brien was unarmed. Three IRA men, wearing trenchcoats and armed with Thompson sub machine guns, came up the drive and opened fire. The shots from the Thompson smashed the windows of his car, wounding him. He <b>alighted</b> and <b>ran</b> for cover to the gate but before reaching it, he was shot by a single round to the head.|$|R
50|$|One {{evening in}} the spring of 1989, Kiranjit was {{allegedly}} attacked by her husband. She later accused him of trying to break her ankles and burn her face with a hot iron, apparently trying to extort money from her extended family. Later that night, while her husband lay sleeping, Kiranjit fetched some petrol and caustic soda mixture from the garage and mixed it to create napalm. She poured it over the bed and set it <b>alight,</b> and <b>ran</b> into a garden with her three-year-old son.|$|R
60|$|About {{two o'clock}} in the day a closed {{carriage}} was driven into Montreuil very fast, by the road from Thouars; the blinds were kept so completely down, that no one could see who was within it; it was driven up {{to the door of the}} house in which the council had been held; the doors of the carriage and of the house were opened, and two persons <b>alighted</b> and <b>ran</b> into the house so quickly that their persons could hardly be recognized, even by those who were looking at them.|$|R
5000|$|In 1727, {{during the}} {{coronation}} of King George II in Westminster Hall, he provided a spectacle of lighting 1800 candles in under three minutes. He {{had used a}} burnable connector that ran from candle to candle. According to the poet Thomas Gray, the Queen and her ladies [...] "were in no small terror" [...] as trains of flax were set <b>alight</b> and flames <b>ran</b> swiftly from candle to candle. The expiring flax fell in large flakes upon the heads of those beneath but, fortunately, did no harm.|$|R
50|$|CIDCO has {{constructed}} a skywalk to facilitate hindrance free movement between Kharghar railway {{station and the}} city node. This skywalk spans across the Sion-Panvel national highway with cable suspension bridge resting on 41 m tall pylon. The total length of the skywalk is 1780 m which makes it India's longest skywalk. It has an open type escalator in the entrance foyer portion of Kharghar railway station with a ramp for <b>alighting.</b> The skywalk <b>runs</b> parallel to the highway between Bharati Vidyapeeth up {{to the entrance of}} Pravesh Marg and then towards Utsav Chowk. There is also a NIFT college stop in between.|$|R
5000|$|London’s Daily Telegraph (July 26) wrote: [...] Motorists were dragged {{from their}} cars to be stoned and beaten with sticks. Others were cut down with knives and axes. Mobs of Sinhala youth rampaged through the streets, ransacking homes, shops and offices, looting them and setting them ablaze, as they sought out {{members of the}} Tamil ethnic minority. A mob {{attacked}} a Tamil cyclist riding near Colombo’s eye hospital. The cyclist was hauled from his bike, drenched with petrol and set <b>alight.</b> As he <b>ran</b> screaming down the street, the mob set on him again and hacked him down with jungle knives.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the other}} end of Europe, the Waffen-SS was dealing with the Warsaw Uprising. Between August and October 1944, the Dirlewanger Brigade (recruited from criminals and the mentally ill {{throughout}} Germany) and the S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A. Russkaya Osvoboditelnaya Narodnaya Armiya (Russian National Liberation Army) which was made up of ethnic Russian collaborators were both sent to Warsaw to put down the uprising. During the battle, the Dirlewanger behaved atrociously, raping, looting, and killing citizens of Warsaw regardless of whether they belonged to the Polish resistance or not; the unit commander SS-Oberführer Oskar Dirlewanger encouraged their excesses. The unit's behavior was reportedly so bestial and indiscriminate that Himmler was forced to send a battalion of SS military police to ensure the Dirlewanger convicts did not turn their aggressions against the leadership of the brigade or other nearby German units. At the same time they were encouraged by Himmler to terrorize freely, take no prisoners, and generally indulge their perverse tendencies. Favoured tactics of the Dirlewanger men during the siege reportedly included the ubiquitous gang rape of female Poles, both women and children; playing [...] "bayonet catch" [...] with live babies; and torturing captives to death by hacking off their arms, dousing them with gasoline, and setting them <b>alight</b> to <b>run</b> armless and flaming down the street. The Dirlewanger brigade committed almost non-stop atrocities during this period, in particular the four-day Wola massacre.|$|R
50|$|Soon, Twig meets some sky pirates, whose {{ship has}} crashed {{due to the}} flight-rock which powers the ship {{falling out of the}} sky when it was struck by lightning. Twig finds out that the sky pirate captain, Quintinius Verginix, is his true father, and learns at long last who he, Twig, really is. To Twig's horror, though, the next morning he awakes in a deserted forest clearing. The sky pirates have jumped ship and {{abandoned}} him... again. Momentarily distraught, Twig sees the pirate's fire float upwards and catch onto a tree, which sets half the forest <b>alight.</b> Twig <b>runs</b> for it, right down to the Edgelands, where he meets the Gloamglozer face to face. In a cruel twist, the Gloamglozer reveals that the entire set of misadventures was a cruel game devised by himself. He tells Twig that he, the Gloamglozer, was all the various creatures which had saved him throughout the journey. The Slaughterer who had mocked Twig was the Gloamglozer in disguise, as was the Trog male, and the goblin {{at the edge of the}} Mire was also the Gloamglozer in goblin form. The demon tells Twig that he only wanted to lure Twig to him so he could throw him over the Edge. The Gloamglozer does just this, although the Caterbird rescues Twig from oblivion and throws him onto the deck of Quintinius Verginix's ship. Finally reunited with his true father, who apologizes for leaving him and promises to always protect his son, Twig, the sky pirates set sail for Undertown, the central city of the Edge.|$|R
60|$|This boded {{no good to}} Marble's {{plans for}} passing the evenings of his old age with Kitty to amuse him; but, as we were now on the brow of the hill, with the cottage in sight, Horace Bright was soon lost to view. To do the girl justice, she {{appeared}} now to think only of her grandmother, and of the effects the recent discovery of her son {{would be likely to}} produce on one of her years and infirmities. As for myself, I was surprised to see Mr. Hardinge in earnest conversation with old Mrs. Wetmore, both seated on the stoop of the cottage, in the mild summer's evening, and Lucy walking, to and fro, on the short grass of the willow bottom, with an impatience and restlessness of manner it was very unusual for her to exhibit. No sooner was Kitty <b>alighted,</b> than she <b>ran</b> to her grandmother, Marble following, while I hastened to the point where was to be found the great object of my interest. Lucy's face was full of feeling and concern, and she received me with an extended hand that, gracious as was the act itself, and most grateful as it would have proved to me under other circumstances, I now feared boded no good.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't make it out," [...] {{the groom}} said. [...] "One {{of the horses}} was sick, and I was down there giving him hot fomentations with my mate. I had been there perhaps an hour when I saw a light {{coming out of the}} drawing-room window, and I ran up shouting; and then I saw there was a light in the dining-room and library too. Then I ran round {{to the back of the}} house, and the housekeeper's room there was <b>alight,</b> too. I <b>run</b> in at the kitchen door and upstairs, and woke the gardeners and got them out. The place was so full of smoke, it was as much as we could do to get downstairs. Then we got a long ladder, and put it against Mrs. Wilson's window, and got her and the girl down. Then we came round this side, and I got up and broke a pane in Mr. Carne's window and shouted. I could not make him hear, so I broke another pane and unfastened the window and lifted it, and went in. I thought he must have been stifled in bed, for the smoke was as thick as possible, and I had to crawl to the bed. Well, master wasn't there. I felt about to see if he was on the floor, but I could find nothing of him; the door was open, and I expect he must have been woke up by the smoke, and went out to see what was the matter, and perhaps got choked by it. I know I was nearly choked myself by the time I got my head out of the window again." ...|$|R
