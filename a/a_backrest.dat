25|$|A {{recliner}} is a reclining armchair. It has <b>a</b> <b>backrest</b> {{that can}} be tilted back, causing a footrest to extend from the front. Edward Knabusch and Edwin Shoemaker invented the first recliner in Monroe, Michigan in 1928 when they modified a wooden porch chair so that the seat moved forward as the back reclined. A padded model was later developed.|$|E
25|$|The only {{three-dimensional}} {{depiction of}} Khufu that has survived time nearly completely {{is a small}} and well restored ivory figurine known as Khufu Statuette. It shows the king with the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. The king is seated on a throne with a short backrest, at {{the left side of}} his knees the Horus-name Medjedu is preserved, and, at the right side, the very scarce rest of the lower part of the cartouche name Khnum-Khuf is visible. Khufu holds a flail in his left hand, and his right hand rests together with the lower arm on his right upper leg. The artifact was found in 1903 by Flinders Petrie at Kom el-Sultan near Abydos. The figurine was found headless; according to Petrie, it was caused by an accident while digging. When Petrie recognized the importance of the find, he stopped all other work and offered a reward to any workman who could find the head. Three weeks later the head was found after intense sifting in a deeper level of the room rubble. Today the little statue is restored and on display in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo in room 32 under its inventory number JE 36143. Most Egyptologists believe the statuette is contemporary, but some scholars, such as Zahi Hawass, think that it was an artistic reproduction of the 26th dynasty. He argues that no building that surely dates to the 4th dynasty was ever excavated at Kom el-Sultan or Abydos. Furthermore, he points out that the face of Khufu is unusually squat and chubby and shows no emotional expression. Hawass compared the facial stylistics with statues of contemporary kings, such as Sneferu, Khaefra and Menkaura. The faces of these three kings are of even beauty, slender and with a kindly expression – the clear result of idealistic motivations; they are not based on reality. The appearance of Khufu on the ivory statue instead looks like the artist did not care very much about professionalism or diligence. And Khufu himself would have never allowed the display of such a comparatively sloppy work. And finally, Hawass also argues that the sort of throne the figurine sits on does not match the artistic styles of any Old Kingdom artifact. Old Kingdom thrones had <b>a</b> <b>backrest</b> that reached up to the neck of a king. But the ultimate proof that convinces Hawass about the statue being a reproduction of much later time is the Nehenekh-flail in Khufu's left hand. Depictions of a king with such a flail as a ceremonial insignia appear no earlier than during the Middle Kingdom. Zahi Hawass therefore concludes that the figurine was possibly made as an amulet or lucky charm to sell to pious citizens.|$|E
2500|$|The core of {{the flat}} frame {{fuselage}} was formed with a horizontal beam about [...] long, to which two other [...] converging struts were attached, making overall a vertical A-frame. The downward sloping extremities of these beams carried a slightly deeper horizontal box structure below the cross beam, with the open pilot's seat and controls upon it. On some later aircraft there was an extra vertical member for the lower cross beam to the wing root to provide the pilot with <b>a</b> <b>backrest.</b> [...] Others enclosed him or her in a simple, light, short nacelle between the nose and the backrest strut. The rear part of the fuselage frame was based on two longer beams reaching to the tail. [...] The upper one was horizontal and attached to both converging A-frame beams, near but not at its apex. The lower one sloped upwards and {{was attached to the}} rear sloping part of the A-frame just below the cross-member. [...] These two rear fuselage beams were cross braced with three more struts, one vertical about halfway to the tail, forming two bays which were crossed diagonally by the other two struts. [...] There was another, short vertical strut in the rear bay between the upper and diagonal members. [...] For landings a skid ran between three projecting ends of the forward and lower A-frame.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> seat and/or <b>backrest</b> {{that moves}} {{dynamically}} can accommodate involuntary extensor thrusts, absorb the extensor tone and, through {{the movement of}} the seating system, dampen the overall impact of hypertonia on the body. Evidence suggests that using <b>a</b> dynamic <b>backrest</b> reduces the sacral sitting that results from the trunk sliding down with repeated extensor thrusting. Research shows that in dynamic seating, the control of upper extremity movement is actually improved as well.|$|R

40|$|Background: Low {{frequency}} horizontal oscillation {{can cause}} motion sickness in {{some forms of}} transport, but {{the influence of the}} characteristics of the motion and the visual and postural conditions of the body on sickness are not known. Hypotheses: It was hypothesised that body position, vision and direction of motion will have an effect on motion sickness. Method: There were 72 seated subjects who were exposed to horizontal oscillation at 0. 25 Hz, 0. 7 ms- 2 r. m. s. (peak-to-peak displacement of 0. 8 m) for up to 30 min while in 1 of 6 conditions. Three conditions involved fore-and-aft motion and three involved lateral motion. For motion in each axis, subjects sat within a closed cabin with either: <b>a)</b> <b>a</b> high <b>backrest</b> with their eyes open; b) <b>a</b> low <b>backrest</b> with their eyes open; or c) <b>a</b> low <b>backrest</b> with their eyes closed and blindfolded. Subjects provided ratings of their motion sickness symptoms at 1 -min intervals during the 30 -min exposures. Results: The most nauseogenic stimulus was fore-and-aft motion with <b>a</b> low <b>backrest</b> and the eyes open. Self-ratings of motion sickness susceptibility provided by subjects before participating in the experiment were positively correlated with their illness ratings during the experiment. Conclusions: Restraint to the upper body during exposure to horizontal acceleration may reduce the susceptibility to motion sickness caused by horizontal oscillation. The relative nauseogenicity of fore-and-aft and lateral oscillation depends on the support given to the upper body. In the conditions of the experiment the effects of the postural support given to the subjects and their prior susceptibility to motion sickness were greater than any effect of the visual conditions...|$|R

40|$|This study {{determined}} how backrest inclination and {{the frequency}} and magnitude of vertical seat vibration influence vibration discomfort. Subjects experienced vertical seat vibration at frequencies in the range 2. 5 to 25 Hz at vibration magnitudes in the range 0. 016 to 2. 0 ms^- 2 r. m. s. Equivalent comfort contours were determined with five backrest conditions: no <b>backrest,</b> and with <b>a</b> stationary <b>backrest</b> inclined at 0 degree (upright), 30, 60 and 90 degree. Within all conditions, the frequency of greatest sensitivity to acceleration decreased with increasing vibration magnitude. Compared to <b>an</b> upright <b>backrest,</b> around the main resonance of the body, the vibration magnitudes required to cause similar discomfort were 100 % greater with 60 -degree and 90 -degree backrest inclinations and 50 % greater with <b>a</b> 30 -degree <b>backrest</b> inclination. It is concluded that no single frequency weighting provides an accurate prediction of the discomfort caused by vertical seat vibration at all magnitudes and with all backrest conditions. Practitioner Summary: Vertical seat vibration is a main cause of vibration discomfort for drivers and passengers of road vehicles. A frequency weighting has been standardised {{for the evaluation of}} vertical seat vibration when sitting upright but it was not known whether this weighting is suitable for the reclined sitting postures often adopted during travel...|$|R

40|$|Unstable {{back support}} against gravity {{results in a}} forward head posture and {{contributes}} to buttocks pressure ulcers. However, the association between these health problems and <b>a</b> wheelchair <b>backrest</b> is unclear. Our newly developed wheelchair (N-WC) supports {{the back of the}} pelvis and thorax from obliquely underneath. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of different backrest shapes on head–neck alignment and seated pressure. Data from 28 healthy subjects were analyzed. Outcome measures were head–neck alignment angles, support angles of the backrest, and pressure distributions on the supporting surfaces. Compared with a typical wheelchair that has <b>a</b> flat <b>backrest,</b> the seat pressure decreased and the center of pressure was located in the middle of both the seat and backrest in the N-WC. Moreover, the head–neck alignment when seated in the N-WC was upright. These results highlight the importance of the shape of the wheelchair backrest...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the effect of <b>a</b> movable <b>backrest</b> on {{vibration}} transmission through the trunk during driving and on the physiological consequences thereof. Eleven healthy male subjects drove for about 1 h on normal roads with a movable and with <b>a</b> fixed <b>backrest</b> while surface electromyography (EMG) was measured at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra (L 5) and vertical accelerations were measured at the seat, backrest and at the spine at the levels of the second sacral vertebra (S 2) and seventh cervical vertebra (C 7). The movable backrest significantly reduced accelerations at C 7 by up to 11. 9 % at the 5 Hz frequency band. The movable backrest also significantly reduced the coherence and transmission between S 2 and C 7 accelerations, but not the differential motion between these sensors. EMG at both sides of L 5 was on average 28 % lower when using the movable backrest. Spinal shrinkage was unaffected by backrest type. It is concluded that <b>a</b> movable <b>backrest</b> reduces the transmission of vibration through the trunk and that it reduces low back EMG. Car driving is associated with the risk of developing low back pain and this may be related to exposure to whole body vibration. This study found an effect of a simple ergonomics measure on the transmission of vibration through the trunk as well as on back muscle activation...|$|R

40|$|Vibration of {{the back}} is a {{potential}} source of discomfort for car passengers, with vibration in the x-axis (i. e. fore-and-aft with <b>an</b> upright <b>backrest)</b> often dominant. This study investigated how vibration discomfort depends on both the frequency of x-axis backrest vibration and the inclination {{of the back}}rest. Twelve subjects seated with <b>a</b> rigid <b>backrest</b> inclined by 0, 30, 60, or 90 degrees rated the discomfort caused by x-axis backrest vibration at 11 frequencies (between 2. 5 and 25 Hz) at 9 levels (from about 3 to 24 dB above the absolute threshold in 3 dB steps) relative to the discomfort caused by 0. 15 ms- 2 r. m. s. 8 -Hz x-axis backrest vibration. The subjects also rated the discomfort caused by 9 levels of 8 -Hz x-axis backrest vibration relative to the discomfort caused by 2. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s. 8 -Hz x-axis (i. e. vertical) vibration of the hand. The vibration acceleration of the backrest required to cause discomfort tended to be least at 8 Hz with the upright backrest and at 10 or 12. 5 Hz with the backrest inclined by 30 ?, 60 ?, or 90 ?. At frequencies from 4 to 8 Hz, about 30 to 40 % less acceleration was required to cause discomfort with the upright backrest than with the inclined backrests. It is concluded that frequency weighting Wc is appropriate for predicting vibration discomfort caused by x-axis vibration of <b>an</b> upright <b>backrest,</b> but that another frequency weighting (e. g. Wb) would be more appropriate for inclined backrests...|$|R

40|$|Background: As the {{population}} ages, {{the number of}} elderly individuals using a wheelchair is increasing. A standard wheelchair with <b>a</b> vertical <b>backrest</b> (S-WC) pushes on a kyphotic spine and exacerbates forward head posture. Forward head posture limits cervical movement. We used a new wheelchair (N-WC) that does not exacerbate thoracic kyphosis. The N-WC does not have <b>a</b> flat <b>backrest,</b> but has <b>a</b> support belt for the thorax and pelvis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare head-neck angle, cervical range of motion, and cervical muscle activity in the N-WC and the S-WC in healthy elderly women. Methods: We measured head-neck alignment, trunk tilt angle, cervical muscle activity, and pressure distribution on the backrest. Data from 17 subjects were analyzed. Results: Head-neck angle was close to neutral in the N-WC. The trunk was tilted further back and the area over which pressure was distributed on the backrest was expanded in the N-WC. Cervical range of motion and cervical muscle activity during neck extension were significantly greater in the N-WC than in the S-WC, but during neck flexion, there was no significant difference between the wheelchairs. Conclusion: In the N-WC, head-neck alignment was close to the neutral posture because the wheelchair support belt accommodated kyphosis and did not push the spine forward, so cervical muscle activity may be reduced when at rest. These results suggest that the N-WC prevented forward head posture and improved cervical movement and muscle activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS and European Union Geriatric Medicine Society.
