5|$|After the war {{both the}} old and new Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets. Despite some attempts at demolition, the underground complex remained largely undisturbed until 1988–89. During reconstruction of that area of Berlin, the sections of the old bunker complex that were excavated were for the most part destroyed. The site remained unmarked until 2006, when a small plaque with <b>a</b> <b>schematic</b> diagram was installed. Some corridors of the bunker still exist, but are sealed off from the public.|$|E
5|$|Crystallographic {{structure}} of fsTnI in troponin complex from chicken fast skeletal muscle showed an overall structure {{similar to that}} of cardiac troponin. The inhibitory region of fsTnI was resolved in skeletal troponin whereas it was invisible in the cardiac troponin crystal structure. Based on the crystal structure, <b>a</b> <b>schematic</b> illustration (Fig. 3) was proposed to show the conformational changes in troponin during muscle activation and relaxation.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 2006, {{during the}} lead-up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, an {{information}} board was installed {{to mark the}} location of the Führerbunker. The board, including <b>a</b> <b>schematic</b> diagram of the bunker, {{can be found at the}} corner of In den Ministergärten and Gertrud-Kolmar-Straße, two small streets about three minutes' walk from Potsdamer Platz. Hitler's bodyguard, Rochus Misch, one of the last people living who was in the bunker at the time of Hitler's suicide, was on hand for the ceremony.|$|E

25|$|A {{high-level}} {{representation of}} an image necessarily contains elements in a different domain from pixels. These elements {{are referred to as}} primitives. In <b>a</b> <b>schematic</b> drawing, for instance, line segments and curves might be primitives. In a graphical user interface, windows and buttons might be the primitives. In 3D rendering, triangles and polygons in space might be primitives.|$|E
25|$|The {{studies by}} Werner Betz (1949, 1939), Einar Haugen (1950, also 1956), and Uriel Weinreich (1953) are {{regarded}} as the classical theoretical works on loan influence. The basic theoretical statements all take Betz’s nomenclature as their starting point. Duckworth (1977) enlarges Betz’s scheme by the type “partial substitution” and supplements the system with English terms. <b>A</b> <b>schematic</b> illustration of these classifications is given below.|$|E

25|$|The {{figure on}} the right {{illustrates}} the difference between distributed and parallel systems.

Figure (b) shows the same distributed system in more detail: each computer has its own local memory, and information can be exchanged only by passing messages from one node to another by using the available communication links. Figure (c) shows a parallel system in which each processor has a direct access to a shared memory.|$|E
