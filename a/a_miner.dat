5|$|Attempts {{by three}} tugs from Cardiff {{to remove the}} wreck were unsuccessful, but the next spring tide carried the {{midsection}} up the estuary onto Town Bar, opposite Padstow, where it was a hazard to shipping. <b>A</b> <b>miner</b> named Pope {{was called in to}} remove it: he used gelignite without success, though the explosion was reported to have broken many windows in the town. In 2010 a wreck, identified as almost certainly the Antoinette, surfaced on Town Bar. The Royal Navy Bomb Disposal Unit failed to demolish it and it was marked with a buoy; in March 2011 work started to demolish the remainder of it using saws.|$|E

5|$|Khrushchev {{was born}} on 15 April 1894, in Kalinovka, a village {{in what is now}} Russia's Kursk Oblast, near the present Ukrainian border. His parents, Sergei Khrushchev and Ksenia Khrushcheva, were poor peasants of Russian origin, and had a {{daughter}} two years Nikita's junior, Irina. Sergei Khrushchev was employed in a number of positions in the Donbas area of far eastern Ukraine, working as a railwayman, as <b>a</b> <b>miner,</b> and laboring in a brick factory. Wages were much higher in the Donbas than in the Kursk region, and Sergei Khrushchev generally left his family in Kalinovka, returning there when he had enough money.|$|E
5|$|The attacks at Fort Blue Mounds {{were two}} {{separate}} incidents which occurred on June 6 and 20, 1832, {{as part of}} the Black Hawk War. In the first incident, area residents attributed the killing of <b>a</b> <b>miner</b> to a band of Ho-Chunk warriors, and concluded that more Ho-Chunk planned to join Black Hawk in his war against white settlers. The second incident occurred east of the fort as a Sauk raiding party, estimated by eyewitnesses to be as large as 100 warriors, attacked two militiamen who were investigating noises heard the night before. Two members of the militia stationed at Blue Mounds were killed in the attack, and both their bodies were badly mutilated.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the village of Ashington was based entirely around coal mining, and though his family had a strong footballing pedigree, his father was <b>a</b> <b>miner.</b> The eldest of four {{brothers}} – Bobby, Gordon and Tommy – the tight finances of the family meant that all four siblings shared the same bed. His father, Bob, {{had no interest in}} football, but his mother, Cissie, played football with her children and later coached the local schools team. As a teenager she took them to watch Ashington and Newcastle United play, and Charlton remained a lifelong Newcastle supporter.|$|E

5|$|There is {{uncertainty}} about Davies's date of birth. Most records say November 1886, though usually with the caveat {{that he might}} have been born several years earlier. His birthplace was 39 John Street, Abercwmboi (then known as Cap Coch) in the South Wales coalfields, the fourth child of Thomas Davies and his wife Esther. Thomas was <b>a</b> <b>miner</b> and trade union activist, who under the pseudonym Y Llwynog ("the Fox") wrote a column for the Welsh language newspaper Tarian y Gweithiwr ("The Worker's Shield"), in which he berated pit management and safety practices. His general militancy led to his blacklisting by pit owners, and after spells of unemployment he eventually found work as an insurance agent.|$|E
5|$|Unable to find work, Fisher and {{his brother}} emigrated to Queensland in 1885.

Here, Fisher worked as <b>a</b> <b>miner,</b> first in Burrum and then in Gympie. He became an engine driver (a role involving the operation of machinery to raise and lower cages in the mine shaft) after attaining the necessary qualifications in 1891. In the same year, he was also elected as the president of an engine driver's union. He was also active in the Amalgamated Miners Union, becoming President of the Gympie branch by 1891.|$|E

He travelled to Brussels later in the year, to follow Theo's recommendation that he study with the Dutch artist Willem Roelofs, who persuaded him – in spite of his dislike of formal schools of art – to attend the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts. He registered at the Académie in November 1880, where he studied anatomy and the standard rules of modelling and perspective.|$|E

5|$|Born in Townhill, near Dunfermline, Liddell was {{the eldest}} of coal miner James and wife Montgomery's six children. During his childhood, Liddell {{experienced}} austerity and poverty, with his family often having to subsist on bread, kail, and salt porridge. His parents became determined {{that he would not}} become <b>a</b> <b>miner</b> and helped him to decide a future career. He did not originally consider football as a viable profession, eventually choosing accountancy in preference to the civil service and church. His interest in football developed at a young age, which persuaded his parents, despite financial difficulties, to buy him a pair of football boots as a Christmas present when he asked for them aged seven. Liddell's participation in organised football began at age eight when he joined his school team, which had an average age of ten.|$|E
5|$|Earp {{was named}} deputy sheriff {{in the area}} {{including}} newly incorporated Kootenai County, Idaho, which was disputing jurisdiction of Eagle City with Shoshone County. There were {{a considerable number of}} disagreements over mining claims and property rights, which Earp had a part in. On March 28, several feet of snow were still on the ground. Bill Buzzard, <b>a</b> <b>miner</b> of dubious reputation, began constructing a building when one of Wyatt's partners, Jack Enright, tried to stop the construction. Enright claimed the building was on part of his property. Words were exchanged and Buzzard reached for his Winchester. He fired several shots at Enright and a skirmish developed. Allies of both sides quickly took defensive positions between snowbanks and began shooting at one another. Deputy Sheriff Wyatt Earp and his brother James stepped {{into the middle of the}} fray and helped peacefully resolve the dispute before anyone was seriously hurt. Shoshone County Deputy W. E. Hunt then arrived and ordered the parties to turn over their weapons.|$|E
5|$|Mary Docherty (27 April 1908 – 2 February 2000) was {{an activist}} {{and member of}} the Communist Party of Great Britain. Born to a working-class family in Cowdenbeath, Scotland, she was {{influenced}} by the communist beliefs of her father, <b>a</b> <b>miner,</b> {{as well as by the}} poverty she grew up in. She joined the Communist Party at the age of 18, and in 1929 traveled to the Soviet Union as a Scottish delegate to a gathering of young communists. She founded a local children's wing of the Communist Party, carried out a successful agitation to declare 1 May a school holiday, and worked for communist Member of Parliament Willie Gallacher. She retired from active politics at the age of 60, but continued to give talks and write her memoirs, published in 1991 as A Miner's Lass.|$|E

5|$|Peel {{was born}} in Churwell, a village close to Morley, on 12 February 1857. He {{was the son of}} <b>a</b> <b>miner,</b> and Peel himself worked in the mines for a time. From the age of 16, he played with {{increasing}} frequency for the Churwell cricket team, and by 1882 was part of the Yorkshire Colts. At the time, Edmund Peate was the first-choice left-arm spin bowler in the Yorkshire team, and his presence restricted Peel's opportunities. An injury to Peate allowed Peel to make his first-class debut for Yorkshire against Surrey at Sheffield on 10 July 1882. Peel took nine wickets in the game, including five for 83 (five wickets taken while conceding 83 runs) in the second innings. Lord Hawke—who assumed the captaincy of Yorkshire later that season—subsequently described Peel's debut {{as one of the most}} impressive for Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression, Sampson worked to control {{government}} costs, but endorsed highway progression. A severe drought in 1930 left 86 of Kentucky's counties applying for federal aid. As unemployment in the eastern coal fields climbed to 40 percent, the United Mine Workers made their first inroads in the region. In 1931, mine owners began firing workers who joined the union. Many of these workers gathered in Evarts, Kentucky. The local sheriff added 26 deputies to his staff, helping enforce the blacklisting of these miners and discourage further organization. Union leaders petitioned Sampson to remove the sheriff and the county judge from office. Violent squabbles between striking union miners and local authorities began as early as mid-April 1931. On May 5, 1931, three guards and <b>a</b> <b>miner</b> were killed in a shootout that became known as the Battle of Evarts. Two days later, Sampson called in the National Guard to disarm both the mine guards and the union miners. All of the union's leaders were arrested, and the strike ultimately failed.|$|E
