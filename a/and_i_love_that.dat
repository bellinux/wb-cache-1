It was better than kissing her, {{it was better than}} anything." [...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed. But that means nothing to kids today. She grew up too fast. She wasn't into innocence, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the episode, several physicians played a game of baseball to cheer up. Rater called it [...] "her favorite scene", explaining: [...] "I loved the scene where Owen, Derek and Mark take Cristina, Meredith and Lexie to the baseball field. This {{is one of the first}} times Owen has seen Cristina's intensity. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> he makes her leave the hospital, focus on something else. That's why he's so good for her. The scene was actually inspired by Shonda saying, let's do a scene where they're all playing baseball. But when I finally saw it, it makes me want to write more scenes like that, with our doctors outside of the hospital, little glimpses of them in real life." ...|$|E

[...] "I won't let this distract me from my duties as a congresswoman," [...] Schmidt told The Cincinnati Enquirer upon McEwen's announcement. [...] "I have a job to do. I can't worry about this." [...] Anti-pornography activist Phil Burress told the Associated Press that a race between Schmidt and McEwen would be tough. [...] "They are two totally different types of personalities. Bob is a statesman, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that.</b> Jean will get in your face in a heartbeat, and I like that too," [...] said Burress. Also running were Deborah A. Kraus, who worked for the West Clermont school district's computer services department, and James E. Constable, who ran to protest the care his disabled son received from a state hospital.|$|E

500|$|In June 2009, West {{announced}} on The View {{he would be}} touring with Gaga, {{but she would not}} perform as an opening act. [...] "She's talented and so incredible that she's not an opening act", he said. [...] "We're doing it together, with no opening act." [...] In August, Gaga expressed her belief that the tour would be [...] "one of the most groundbreaking moments in touring history." [...] Before the singer agreed to collaborate with West, she demanded that the tour would remain accessible to her gay fans. [...] "I'm gay", she recalled telling West in an interview with Out magazine, [...] "my music is gay. My show is gay. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> it's gay. And I love my gay fans and they're all going to be coming to our show. And it's going to remain gay." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{columnist}} Abby West praised Fischer's [...] "masterful" [...] performance, {{writing that}} it [...] "really {{is nice to}} see Pam coming into her own... <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> she didn't inhibit herself when Jim walked in — she just ran right up and hugged him." [...] West also highlighted Carell and Helms, explaining that with the former, [...] "Michael is never completely loathsome — because Steve Carell imbues him with such vulnerability." [...] AOL TV writer Michael Sciannamea also enjoyed Helms' performance, believing that [...] "the competition between Andy and Dwight will surely make for some classic moments." [...] Sciannamea concluded his review, [...] "What makes this show so great is that the supporting players {{have a chance to}} shine at the right moments. I thought Stanley's reactions to the whole situation were hysterical, and Creed is just great. He deserves some more airtime." ...|$|E
500|$|Jenny was {{negatively}} received amongst TV critics and viewers {{from the very}} first episode after she cheated on her nice guy boyfriend, Tim, with another woman for no clear reason. This prompted Chaiken to implement a series of changes to Jenny to help make her more likable. Chaiken defended Jenny stating: [...] "I'm well aware of the response to Jenny. I love the character, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> people are passionate about her. I know {{there are a lot of}} people who just can't stand her. And that's why it's so important to have that character in the mix." [...] Kirshner defended Jenny stating: [...] "Jenny's a very controversial character. I think the great thing about her is the fact that she's so flawed." [...] During season two Jenny is seen coming out, getting her hair cut and becoming best friends with Shane McCutcheon (Katherine Moennig). AfterEllen.com stated that Jenny cutting off her hair was a defining moment in her development because it also symbolized her cutting all of the bad stuff that happened before out of her life. Jenny's transition continued into season three, Chaiken stated: [...] "We find Jenny coming together, I predict this [...] that Jenny will be more likable and accessible to the audience than she has ever been. She's recovering." ...|$|E

5000|$|Savill {{also stated}} that other guitarists {{influenced}} him: [...] "Marr {{made me want to}} play the guitar, but also quickly made me want to quit because I realised quickly that I was never gonna be as good. William Reid then made me realise I didn’t need to be technically amazing. Just so powerful, simple and totally brilliant. Their bass player only had two strings on his bass <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>that.</b> Then Kevin Shields with the weird tunings and out of this world sounds. Robin Guthrie was also a big influence" ...|$|R

500|$|There was {{a strong}} {{reaction}} from the show's viewers. Adler said, [...] "I've heard {{from a lot of}} fans how important this character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted." [...] He wants Karofsky to [...] "accept himself and come out because [...] it would be a beacon of hope for everyone else who's struggling", and noted, [...] "people do get hope from Glee." [...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I also love Max <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful. Chilling, terrifying, horrifying, yet, at the same time, heartbreaking. … Because there are kids who have messaged me since that episode saying they used to hear that line spoken to them {{day in and day out}} at school", and they dreaded school because of it.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson {{continued}} feuding with Tedder in 2010. In December 2009, Tedder {{said that}} he was no longer angry over the accusations Clarkson made, but warned, [...] "fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. [...] I don't wanna get some crazy-ass backlash or get my head snapped off for writing a hit song." [...] He later told The Denver Post that he had gotten over the situation and is working on new material for Clarkson's fifth album. Clarkson, however, told the Daily Star that she is writing and recording new songs with new, low-profile producers. [...] "I don’t like working with people who have worked with everyone. Sometimes I get blackmailed into doing so by my label," [...] she said, [...] "but I prefer collaborating with people who aren't on the grid. I don’t want to sound exactly like other people's records." [...] In May, an unreleased electro-pop song by Clarkson called [...] "Wash, Rinse, Repeat" [...] was leaked on the Internet. The song contains auto tuned lyrics that Idolator say are likely written about Tedder: [...] "I can't take the pressure of new. Give me old, rip it off. / Let's see if it sticks to the wall again. / Does it sound familiar? Does it linger in your ear? / Like something you remember from just last year?" [...] and [...] "Music from the past, from the present, well, just last week / We will change a note and get away with it, wait and see." [...] Tedder {{said that he}} thinks the song was written about him, too, but admitted he likes the song. [...] "I think Kelly speaks her mind regardless of anything. She's great with lyrics, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> she is her own person. She's no puppet." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Birds of Prey {{approached}} its hundredth issue, Simone used issues #99 and #100 {{to shake}} up the lineup. She let Black Canary leave the team with her ward, a little girl called [...] "Sin", and used a prison break arc to introduce superhumanly strong Big Barda, pacifist Judomaster and rascally Misfit into the new squad, and with the new Spy Smasher as an ambiguous Jack Bauer-like anti-heroine and Lois Lane cornering Oracle into almost giving away her secret identity. Again, the characters were chosen to provide a foil for each other, and affirmed her love for her characters: [...] "The team {{is a group of}} individuals, quite unlike the friendship between Dinah, Helena and Babs. And any team with Barda on it automatically has a certain bull in a China shop tremble, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that...</b> The characters don't apologize for being asskickers, nor for being smart, nor for being sexy, nor for being sexual, for that matter. There {{are always going to be}} some people who find that not to their taste, but at the same time, Birds of Prey regularly brings in people who don't otherwise read mainstream comics, a whole audience that may not pick up any other superhero titles, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> niche, that little area between good taste and utter shamelessness." [...] Finally, Simone stated her agony of leaving the book: [...] "I miss the characters in all the books I've worked on. Writing the last issue of Birds of Prey I'm doing was actually physically painful." ...|$|E
5000|$|Giacchino {{only had}} {{four and a}} half weeks to compose the music for the film, {{beginning}} almost immediately after finishing production on Doctor Strange. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly in November 2016, Giacchino stated: [...] "It is a film that is in many ways a really great World War II movie, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>that</b> about it. But it also has this huge, huge heart at the center of it, and that was the one thing I just didn't want to discount. Yes, it's an action movie, and it's a Star Wars film, and it has all the things that you would come to expect <b>and</b> <b>love</b> about <b>that,</b> but <b>I</b> didn't want to forget that it was also an incredibly emotional movie as well. That was what really pulled me in." ...|$|R
500|$|Dixon {{has often}} cited Madonna as an influence, saying [...] "Madonna {{is a big}} idol. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> her when <b>I</b> {{was a young girl}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feel like I've been on a musical journey with her". Dixon's single [...] "Let's Get Excited" [...] namechecked the singer and her 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove". Furthermore, the music video {{featured}} what Dixon described as [...] "a Madonna tribute" [...] featuring voguing throughout. Additionally, Dixon has described Kylie Minogue as her childhood idol. Growing up, the first record Dixon ever bought was [...] "Push It" [...] by the hip hop group Salt-n-Pepa; she remarked [...] "I didn't understand {{what they were talking about}} at the time... They were raw and did their own thing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> artists who don't conform to what people expect of them".|$|R

2500|$|Bow Wow had {{publicly}} {{announced his}} interpretation of the song's meaning as he stated {{in an interview with}} MTV: [...] "Basically the song is me talking to a girl and telling her, 'These are the things I can do for you. Let me hold you down. This is what I want to do for you as a man. These are the things I'm capable of doing for you if you get with me. Just hear me out.' I'm just really talking to the ladies. The song is really special to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> song." [...] The collaboration began when Bow Wow was talking with producer Jermaine Dupri about the song and how he suggested on getting Omarion to appear on the track.|$|E
6000|$|... "That was {{my first}} human love. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> girl still. I doubt {{sometimes}} whether I have ever loved anyone else. I kept the thing very secret.

I resorted {{to all sorts of}} tortuous devices and excuses to get a chance of seeing her again without betraying what it was I was after." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt;--no doubt. But {{you will}} not be angry with me for saying that after what has {{occurred}} here, your presence has been most anxiously expected.

But I am not given to much upbraiding, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> dear and innocent young face too well to desire anything now but that the owner of it should receive at your hands that which is due to her before God and man." ...|$|E
