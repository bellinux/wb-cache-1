5|$|The season {{produced}} the highest Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) on {{record with a}} total of 259. The measurement is <b>a</b> <b>method</b> <b>to</b> compare tropical cyclone activity between seasons. Originally, 1933 had an ACE of 213, which was surpassed by 1950 and 2005. However, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project found that the storms in 1933 were stronger than initially reported.|$|E

5|$|In 1785, he {{was asked}} by the cabildo (town council) to write about smallpox, the worst medical problem the Audiencia faced.

This work is a valuable historical source as a description of the hygienic and sanitary conditions of colonial America.|$|E

The bill was passed by the Indiana House of Representatives, but rejected by the Senate, meaning it did not become a law.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{his major}} {{interest}} was {{the theory of}} the continuous spectrum and his first published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He developed <b>a</b> <b>method</b> <b>to</b> carry out calculations of its transition probabilities. He calculated the photoelectric effect for hydrogen and X-rays, obtaining the absorption coefficient at the K-edge. His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the sun, but not helium. Years later it was realized that the sun was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were indeed correct.|$|E
5|$|Later, Allison {{acquired}} a 2 MeV Van de Graaff generator, and he recalled an old paper on producing lithium ions from minerals like Eucryptite. This {{allowed him to}} produce a 1.2 MeV lithium ion beam. He created hitherto unknown isotopes of boron and other light elements, and measured their neutron capture cross sections. A side effect of this work was <b>a</b> <b>method</b> <b>to</b> analyze surface materials where chemical analysis was unavailable. His colleague Anthony L. Turkevich subsequently used this to analyze {{the makeup of the}} Moon on the later Surveyor program missions. Allison continued to take on Ph.D. candidates, some of whom, such as James Cronin went on to distinguished careers.|$|E

5|$|The EES's {{early work}} was {{conducted}} {{in the basement of}} the Shop Building, and Vaughan's office was in the Aeronautical Engineering Building. By 1938, the EES was producing useful technology, and the station needed <b>a</b> <b>method</b> <b>to</b> conduct contract work outside of the state budget. Consequently, the Industrial Development Council (IDC) was formed. It was created by the Chancellor of the University System and the president of Georgia Power Company, and the EES's director was a member of the council. The IDC later became the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, which currently serves as the sole contract organization for all Georgia Tech faculty and departments.|$|E
5|$|The Saegusa–Ito {{oxidation}} is {{a chemical}} reaction used in organic chemistry. It {{was discovered in}} 1978 by Takeo Saegusa and Yoshihiko Ito as <b>a</b> <b>method</b> <b>to</b> introduce α-β unsaturation in carbonyl compounds. The reaction as originally reported involved formation of a silyl enol ether followed by treatment with palladium(II) acetate and benzoquinone to yield the corresponding enone. The original publication noted its utility for regeneration of unsaturation following 1,4-addition with nucleophiles such as organocuprates.|$|E

Weinreb and Steven Nahm as <b>a</b> <b>method</b> <b>to</b> synthesize ketones. The original reaction involved two subsequent nucleophilic acyl substitutions: the conversion of an acid chloride with N,O-Dimethylhydroxylamine, to form a Weinreb–Nahm amide, and subsequent treatment of this species with an organometallic reagent such as a Grignard reagent or organolithium reagent. Nahm and Weinreb also reported the synthesis of aldehydes by reduction of the amide with an excess of lithium aluminum hydride (see amide reduction).|$|E
5|$|The single-origin {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the mechanism of evolution in most cases has been gene duplication followed by natural selection for adaptive traits. Some of the various adaptations produced by this process include venom more toxic to specific prey in several lineages, proteins that pre-digest prey, and <b>a</b> <b>method</b> <b>to</b> track down prey after a bite. These various adaptations of venom have also led to considerable debate about the definition of venom and venomous snakes.|$|E
