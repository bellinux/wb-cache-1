5|$|Pesticides {{derived from}} plants include nicotine, rotenone, {{strychnine}} and pyrethrins. Plants such as tobacco, cannabis, opium poppy, and coca yield psychotropic chemicals. Poisons from plants include <b>atropine,</b> ricin, hemlock and curare, {{though many of}} these also have medicinal uses.|$|E
5|$|Those {{taking more}} than 4mg per day have an {{increased}} potential for dependence. This medication may cause withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt withdrawal or rapid tapering, which in some cases {{have been known to}} cause seizures, as well as marked delirium similar to that produced by the anticholinergic tropane alkaloids of Datura (scopolamine and <b>atropine).</b> The discontinuation of this medication may also cause a reaction called rebound anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Many {{currently}} available pharmaceuticals {{are derived from}} the secondary metabolites plants use {{to protect themselves from}} herbivores, including opium, aspirin, cocaine, and <b>atropine.</b> These chemicals have evolved to affect the biochemistry of insects in very specific ways. However, many of these biochemical pathways are conserved in vertebrates, including humans, and the chemicals act on human biochemistry in ways similar to that of insects. It has therefore been suggested that the study of plant-insect interactions may help in bioprospecting.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley. At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of keratitis, which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, left him with one eye just capable of light {{perception}} {{and the other with}} an unaided Snellen fraction of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both corneas, complicated by hyperopia and astigmatism. He was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with <b>atropine,</b> to allow that eye to see around an opacity {{in the center of the}} cornea.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal tubes {{can be used}} {{to ensure}} the {{adequate}} exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, to deliver oxygen in higher concentrations than found in air, or to administer other gases such as helium, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, xenon, or certain volatile anesthetic agents such as desflurane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane. They may also be used as a route for administration of certain medications such as bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and drugs used in treating cardiac arrest such as <b>atropine,</b> epinephrine, lidocaine and vasopressin.|$|E
5|$|Many natural poisons act as {{neurotoxins}} {{that can}} cause paralysis leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the glycoalkaloids, from the plant species in the Solanaceae family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, <b>atropine</b> from deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{medicines}} {{can cause}} adverse effects and even death, whether by side-effects of their active substances, by adulteration or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription. Many such effects are known, while others {{remain to be}} explored scientifically. There {{is no reason to}} presume that because a product comes from nature it must be safe: the existence of powerful natural poisons like <b>atropine</b> and nicotine shows this to be untrue. Further, the high standards applied to conventional medicines do not always apply to plant medicines, and dose can vary widely depending on the growth conditions of plants: older plants may be much more toxic than young ones, for instance.|$|E
5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include <b>atropine</b> for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E
5|$|If the {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} falls below 90 mmHg {{within days of the}} injury, blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced, resulting in further damage. Thus it is important to maintain the blood pressure using a central venous catheter, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors, and to treat cases of shock. Mean arterial blood pressure is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg for seven days after injury. The treatment for shock from blood loss (hypovolemic shock) is different from that for neurogenic shock, and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why someone is in shock. However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time. Another important aspect of care is prevention of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream), which could deprive the spinal cord of much-needed oxygen. People with cervical injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate; treatment to speed it up include <b>atropine</b> and electrical cardiac pacing.|$|E
5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore <b>atropine</b> or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E
25|$|In overdoses, <b>atropine</b> is poisonous. <b>Atropine</b> is {{sometimes}} added to potentially addictive drugs, particularly anti-diarrhea opioid {{drugs such as}} diphenoxylate or difenoxin, wherein the secretion-reducing effects of the <b>atropine</b> can also aid the anti-diarrhea effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} <b>atropine</b> {{compound}} used in medicine is <b>atropine</b> sulfate (monohydrate) (C17H23NO3)2·H2SO4·H2O, the full chemical name is 1α H, 5α H-Tropan-3-α ol (±)-tropate(ester), sulfate monohydrate.|$|E
25|$|In an emergency, {{intravenous}} clenbuterol or <b>atropine</b> may be used, but {{care must}} be exercised with <b>atropine,</b> as it may predispose to adverse systemic side effects such as mydriasis, excitement, GI stasis and colic.|$|E
25|$|In {{refractive}} and accommodative amblyopia, when occlusion is {{not appropriate}} sometimes <b>atropine</b> is given to induce blur in the good eye. Evidence suggests that <b>atropine</b> penalization is just as effective as occlusion in improving visual acuity.|$|E
25|$|The {{antidote}} to <b>atropine</b> is physostigmine or pilocarpine.|$|E
25|$|The {{mydriatic}} {{effects of}} <b>atropine</b> were studied among others by the German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge (1795–1867). In 1831, the German pharmacist Heinrich F. G. Mein (1799-1864) succeeded in preparing <b>atropine</b> in pure crystalline form. The substance was first synthesized by German chemist Richard Willstätter in 1901.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atropine</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} pre-disposed to narrow angle glaucoma.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atropine</b> is a non-selective {{competitive}} antagonist with Acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors.|$|E
25|$|Topical <b>atropine</b> {{is used as}} a cycloplegic, to {{temporarily}} paralyze the accommodation reflex, and as a mydriatic, to dilate the pupils. <b>Atropine</b> degrades slowly, typically wearing off in 7 to 14 days, so it is generally used as a therapeutic mydriatic, whereas tropicamide (a shorter-acting cholinergic antagonist) or phenylephrine (an α-adrenergic agonist) is preferred as an aid to ophthalmic examination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atropine</b> can be {{synthesized}} by {{the reaction}} of tropine with tropic acid {{in the presence of}} hydrochloric acid.|$|E
25|$|Injections of <b>atropine</b> {{are used}} in the {{treatment}} of bradycardia (a heart rate < 60 beats per minute).|$|E
25|$|Treatment of corneal ulcers {{includes}} topical {{antibiotic therapy}} to prevent infection, and pain medications, including topical <b>atropine</b> to stop spasms of the ciliary muscle. <b>Atropine</b> may decrease tear production and interfere with corneal healing. Superficial ulcers usually heal {{in less than}} a week. Deep ulcers and descemetoceles may require corneal suturing, conjunctival grafts or conjunctival flaps, soft contact lenses, or corneal transplant. Topical corticosteroids and anesthetics should not be used on any type of corneal ulcer because they prevent healing and will often make them worse.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atropine</b> {{has also}} been used {{in an effort to}} prevent a low heart rate during {{intubation}} of children; however, evidence does not support this use.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atropine</b> is a {{competitive}} antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor types M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5. It {{is classified as}} an anticholinergic drug (parasympatholytic).|$|E
25|$|Intravenous calcium {{gluconate}} {{is considered a}} specific antidote. Slow heart rate can be treated with <b>atropine</b> and sympathomimetics. Low blood pressure is treated with vasopressors such as adrenaline.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atropine</b> eye drops {{have been}} shown to be {{effective}} in slowing the progression of myopia in children in several studies, but it is not available for this use, and side effects would limit its use.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atropine</b> {{is found}} in {{many members of the}} Solanaceae family. The most {{commonly}} found sources are Atropa belladonna, Datura innoxia, D. metel, and D. stramonium. Other sources include members of the Brugmansia and Hyoscyamus genera.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{initially}} {{begins by}} correcting dehydration and electrolyte problems. This is then typically followed by surgery. Results are generally good {{both in the}} short term and in the long term. Some treat the condition without surgery by using <b>atropine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Treatment for {{suspected}} tabun poisoning {{is often}} three injections of a nerve agent antidote, such as <b>atropine.</b> Pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM Cl) also {{works as an}} antidote; however, it must be administered within minutes to a few hours following exposure to be effective.|$|E
25|$|Many {{individuals}} and groups, especially those within the mainstream medical profession, attempted {{to analyze the}} Keeley Cure for its ingredients and reports varied widely as to their identity. Strychnine, alcohol, apomorphine, willow bark, ammonia, and <b>atropine</b> were among the many suggested chemicals.|$|E
25|$|Different {{medications}} are {{tried in}} an effort to find a combination that is effective for a specific person. Not all people will respond well to the same medications. Medications that have had positive results in some include: diphenhydramine, benzatropine and <b>atropine.</b> anti-Parkinsons agents (such as ropinirole and bromocriptine), and muscle relaxants (such as diazepam).|$|E
25|$|A study {{provided}} evidence that children treated for amblyopia with eye patching had lower self-perception of social acceptance. To avoid {{a child from}} being socially marginalized by its peers due to the wearing of an eye patch, <b>atropine</b> eye drops may be used instead. This induces temporary blurring in the treated eye.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, {{the search}} for a {{synthetic}} substitute for <b>atropine</b> culminated serendipitously in the discovery of meperidine, the first opiate with a structure altogether different from that of morphine. This was followed in 1947 by the widespread introduction of methadone, another structurally unrelated compound with pharmacological properties similar to those of morphine.|$|E
25|$|Toxic {{substances}} and poisons (like <b>atropine)</b> can {{significantly reduce the}} range of aperture. Pharmaceutical products such as eye drops may also cause similar side-effects. Tropicamide and phenylephrine are used in medicine as mydriatics to dilate pupils for retinal and lens examination. These medications take effect in about 30–45 minutes after instillation and last for about 8 hours. <b>Atropine</b> is also used {{in such a way}} but its effects can last up to 2 weeks, along with the mydriatic effect; it produces cycloplegia (a condition in which the crystalline lens of the eye cannot accommodate to focus near objects). This effect goes away after 8 hours. Other medications offer the contrary effect. Pilocarpine is a miotic (induces miosis); it can make a pupil as small as 1mm in diameter depending on the person and their ocular characteristics. Such drops are used in certain glaucoma patients to prevent acute glaucoma attacks.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{experiments}} on frogs, the Japanese group {{carried out a}} series of classical pharmacological investigations of candicine on cats and rabbits, and on various isolated animal organs/tissues. In rabbits, doses of 0.6mg/kg, i.v., of candicine produced respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances lasting about 15 minutes. Body temperature was not affected; there was also mydriasis followed by miosis, and hypersalivation. In rabbits, i.v. doses of 2.1mg/kg produced apnea, followed by death. In anesthetized cats, doses of 0.06–0.12mg/kg, iv., also caused respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances: although the details were concentration-and time-dependent, the ultimate effects were ones of sustained respiratory stimulation and elevated blood pressure; the hypertension was not inhibited by <b>atropine,</b> but was antagonized by hexamethonium. Candicine caused contraction of the cat nictitating membrane. A concentration of 0.012mg/mL applied to the isolated guinea pig atrium caused a decrease in the amplitude and rate of contractions, these effects being enhanced by eserine, but inhibited by <b>atropine</b> pre-treatment. Concentrations of 3-6μg/mL produced contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum which were inhibited by pre-treatment with <b>atropine,</b> hexamethonium, tubocurarine or cocaine, but were not affected by the presence of pyribenzamine or chlorpheniramine. Summarizing the results of these and other observations, the authors concluded that: candicine was primarily a stimulant of autonomic ganglia; it liberated catecholamines from the adrenal medulla; it showed muscarine-like and sympathomimetic effects in some assays, and it was a neuromuscular blocker of the depolarizing type. In many of these respects, candicine resembled nicotine and dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP).|$|E
