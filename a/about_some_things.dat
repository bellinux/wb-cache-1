500|$|On October 12, 1991, {{breaking}} news forced ABC News to interrupt regular Saturday morning programming again. Jennings {{was once again}} mindful of his audience, prefacing {{the coverage of the}} Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas with remarks for children. [...] "You may hear some not very nice language," [...] said Jennings. He noted that Thomas and his accuser, Anita Hill, [...] "have a very painful disagreement <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> the woman says the man did to her when they were working together...You can ask your parents to tell you more." [...] Jennings continued to produce special programs aimed at young viewers, anchoring Growing Up in the Age of AIDS, a frank, 90-minute-long discussion on AIDS in February 1992; and Prejudice: Answering Children's Questions, a forum on racism in April 1992.|$|E
500|$|In Illinois v. Gates, the Supreme Court {{established}} that courts should apply a [...] "totality of the circumstances" [...] test {{to determine whether}} an anonymous tip is sufficiently reliable to provide probable cause to issue an arrest warrant. Although officers in Gates did not personally witness any criminal activity, the Supreme Court held that the anonymous tip in question was reliable, because officers could verify several events predicted by the anonymous tip. Seven years after Gates, the Supreme Court held in Alabama v. White that an anonymous tip was sufficiently reliable to provide reasonable suspicion to justify a temporary detention, because the tip accurately predicted several key details. Although the Court conceded that White was a [...] "close case", the tip in question [...] "exhibited sufficient indicia of reliability" [...] to justify a temporary detention. The Court explained that [...] if [...] "an informant is shown to be right <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>things,</b> he is probably right about other facts that he has alleged, including {{the claim that the}} object of the tip is engaged in criminal activity." ...|$|E

I don't notice much when a fellow sets out to do right that folks think everybody else is on the square. No, sir, they don't seem to consider that kind of complaint so catching. Now, you take another thing: A woman goes round with the scarlet fever in her clothes, and a whole carful of people take it home to their children; but let a nice young girl get in, fresh as an apple, and a perfect daisy for wholesomeness every way, and she don't give it to a single soul on board.
