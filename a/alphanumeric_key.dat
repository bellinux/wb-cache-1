25|$|In November 2013, Humble Bundle, Inc. {{implemented}} a system on redemption of bundles that, for Steam games, {{would not give}} the user the <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>key</b> but instead automatically redeemed the key within Steam through Steam account linking {{as a means to}} avoid abuse of the key system. Despite this, Ed Key, one of the developers from Proteus which was featured in Humble Indie Bundle 8, has found by checking his game's key redemption logs that some third-party sites, like 7 Entertainment, have been offering keys to his and other games from other Humble Bundles for profit. The price these sites offer undercut the current price of such games on digital marketplaces and without reciprocating sales back to the developers or charity organizations. Such resales are against both Humble Bundle's and Steam's terms of service, and currently Humble Bundle, Inc. is working with affected developers to help stop this abuse. 7 Entertainment has responded to these issues by changing its own terms of service to the marketplaces that use it to prevent and deal with these key sales.|$|E

2500|$|The English {{alphanumeric}} keyboard has a dedicated key {{for each of}} the letters A–Z, along with keys for punctuation and other symbols. In many other languages there are additional letters (often with diacritics) or symbols, which also need to be available on the keyboard. To make room for additional symbols, keyboards often have what is effectively a secondary shift key, labeled [...] (which typically takes the place of the right-hand [...] key). It can be used to type an extra symbol in addition to the two otherwise available with an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>key,</b> and using it simultaneously with the [...] key may even give access to a fourth symbol. On the visual layout, these third-level and fourth-level symbols may appear on the right half of the key top, or they may be unmarked.|$|E

The user can type using only ASCII characters found on standard computer keyboard layouts. Because the Vietnamese alphabet uses a complex system of diacritical marks, the keyboard needs 133 <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>keys</b> and a Shift key {{to cover all}} possible characters.|$|R

30|$|Table 6 shows a {{comparison}} between results obtained here and previous research efforts. A comparison is not statistically valid as these systems use different sample size with different parameters and methodologies to measure the keystroke. It {{is important to note}} that earlier research emphasized on the strength of the password string and as a result, the users had to use either lengthy strings (sometimes 4 strings) or strong strings (combination of <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>keys</b> and special characters). PBAS, however, does not require lengthy or strong password strings. Consequently, it is more user friendly, but on the other hand this makes it more susceptible to intruder attacks.|$|R
25|$|Handheld {{ergonomic}} keyboards {{are designed}} to be held like a game controller, and can be used as such, instead of laid out flat on top of a table surface. Typically handheld keyboards hold all the <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>keys</b> and symbols that a standard keyboard would have, yet only be accessed by pressing two sets of keys at once; one acting as a function key similar to a 'Shift' key that would allow for capital letters on a standard keyboard. Handheld keyboards allow the user the ability to move around a room or to lean back on a chair while also being able to type in front or away from the computer. Some variations of handheld ergonomic keyboards also include a trackball mouse that allow mouse movement and typing included in one handheld device.|$|R

The students who enrolled in the keyboarding course were assessed by timed writings, production applications, and personal interviews for grade-level placement. Production assignments were given to students assessed at the advanced level; modeling of function <b>keys</b> and <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>keys</b> and drills were given to students with no previous computer experience. One-on-one instruction {{was the most common}} mode of delivery; peer tutoring was next. Students worked at their own pace, since the textbook provided step-by-step instruction. Advanced students were also given the opportunity to complete complex. abs. tract, and the-tical assignments to achieve advanced level.

5000|$|In 2004, Microsoft {{introduced}} the restyled Natural MultiMedia Keyboard, which reworked {{the row of}} multimedia buttons and included the controversial F Lock feature, originally debuted in the Microsoft Office Keyboard. Another common criticism is that although the bunched arrow keys of previous generation has been fixed by returning to the standard inverted T layout, the Home/End/Del/Ins/Page up/down set has been changed to 3x2 vertical layout, with the Insert key moved to the [...] "PrtScn/SysRq" [...] key, and del key expanded. On the Natural Multimedia Keyboard, the status indicator lights for Num lock, Scroll lock, and Caps lock were moved from between the banks of <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>keys</b> to a more traditional location above {{and to the right}} of the backspace key. The Natural Multimedia Keyboard was manufactured in at least three different color schemes, including white with blue accents, black with silver accents, and white with black accents.|$|R
40|$|Trie hashing is a scheme, {{proposed}} by Litwin, for indexing records with very long <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>keys.</b> The records are grouped into buckets of capacity b and maintained on secondary storage. To retrieve a record, the memory resident trie is traversed from the root to a leaf node where {{the address of}} the target bucket is found. Using the address found, the data bucket is read into memory and searched to determine {{the presence or absence of}} the record. The scheme, for all practical purposes, locates a record in one or two disk accesses. Unlike a trie, the scheme proposed suffers from potential degeneracy when the keys inserted are ordered and has an expensive reconstruction cost if a system failure occurs during a session. We present a new approach to implementing Trie Hashing that resolves the degeneracy problem. Our approach combines the basic trie hashing algorithm with the balancing techniques of the Red-Black Binary Search Tree, to produce a relatively balanced trie hashing scheme. As [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an FPGA implementation of image encryption method using carrier images and scan patterns generated by scan methodology. The scan is a language-based two-dimensional spatial-accessing methodology which can efficiently specify and generate {{a wide range}} of scanning paths. Then scanning paths sequence fill in original image. The carrier image is created with the help of alphanumeric keyword. Each <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>key</b> will be having a unique 8 bit value generated by 4 out of 8 -code. This newly generated carrier image is added with the original image to obtain encrypted image. The scan methodology is applied to either original image or carrier image, after the addition of original image and carrier image to obtain the highly distorted encrypted image. By applying the reverse we get the decrypted image. Reversible logic is most popular concept in energy efficient computations and this will be demand for upcoming future computing technologies.

40|$|The {{representation}} of multidimensional data {{is a central}} issue in database design, {{as well as in}} many other elds, including computer graphics, com- putational geometry, pattern recognition, geographic information systems and others. Indeed, multidimensional points can represent locations, as well as more general records that arise in database management systems. For instance, consider an employee record that has attributes corresponding to the employee's name, address, sex, age, height and weight. Although the di erent dimensions have di erent data types (name and address are strings of characters; sex is a binary eld; and age, height and weight are numbers), these records can be treated as points in a six-dimensional space. We may see a database as a collection of records. Each record has several attributes, some of which are keys. The associative retrieval problem consists of answering queries with respect to a le of multidimensional records. Such an associative query requires the retrieval of those records in the le whose key attributes satisfy a certain condition. Examples of associative queries are intersection queries and nearest neighbor queries. In order to facilitate the retrieval of records based on some conditions on its key attributes, it is usually helpful to assumed the existence of an ordering for its values. In the case of numeric keys, such an ordering is quite obvious. In the case of <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>keys,</b> the ordering is usually based on the alphabetic sequence of the characters making up the attribute value. Furthermore, certain queries, like nearest neighbor searches, require the existence of a distance function...|$|R

The required level of security may be achieved by authenticating a group key in the communication channel, where contribution from each group member becomes {{a part of the}} overall group key. In the current work, we have developed an authentication system through Central Administrative Server (CAS) for automatic integration and validation of the group key. For secured group communication, the CAS generates a secret <b>alphanumeric</b> group <b>key</b> image. Using secret image sharing scheme, this group key image shares are distributed among all the participating group members in the open network. Some or all the secret shares may be merged to reconstruct the group key image at CAS. A k-nearest neighbor classifier with 48 features to represent the images, is used to validate the reconstructed image with the one stored in the CAS. 48 topological features are used to represent the reconstructed group key image.

40|$|Password {{authentication}} is {{the most}} widely used authentication mechanism, and it will still be with us for many years yet to come. It is effective, simple, and accurate, with no extra cost. The strength of password authentication relies on the strength of the passwords. Good (or strong) passwords are essential for high level security. End user education and computerized proactive password checking play vital roles in ensuring good passwords. However, both demand clear, simple, and concise rules on what a good password is. It is not hard to find guidelines and advices on good passwords; but it is not so easy to find a clear, simple, and concise rule to be used for end user education and computer programs for proactive password checking. In this paper, we develop a theoretic framework on measuring password quality – password quality indicator (PQI). A PQI of a password is a pair λ = (D, L), where D is the Levenshtein's edit distance of the password to the base dictionary words, and L is the effective password length. Based on PQI, we further simplify the rule for a good password to at least 8 characters long, with at least 3 special characters plus other <b>alphanumeric</b> characters. <b>Key</b> words...|$|R
