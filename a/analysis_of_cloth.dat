With existing approaches characteristic behaviour like folding and buckling cannot be reproduced in a physically convincing way. We present a new method {{based on a}} corotational formulation of subdivision finite elements. Due to the non-local nature of the employed subdivision basis functions a C 1 -continuous displacement field can be defined. It is thus possible to use the governing equations of thin shell analysis leading to a physically accurate bending behaviour. Using a corotated strain tensor allows the large displacement <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> while retaining a linear system of equations. Hence, known convergence properties and computational efficiency are preserved. ...|$|E

In the second part, we demonstrate a novel vision technique for <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> draping behavior, This technique allows for estimation of cloth model parameters, such as bending properties, but {{can also be used}} to estimate the contact points between the body and clothing in the range data of dressed humans. Combined with our body reconstruction algorithm and additional constraints on the articulation model, the detection of the garment-body contact points allows construction of a dressed human model in which even the geometry that was covered by clothing in the available data is reasonably well estimated...|$|E
40|$|Deficient cloth-to-cloth {{collision}} {{response is}} the most serious shortcoming of most cloth simulation systems. Past approaches to clothcloth collision have used history to decide whether nearby cloth regions have interpenetrated. The biggest pitfall of history-based methods is that an error anywhere along the way can give rise to persistent tangles. This is a particularly serious issue for production character animation, because characters' bodies routinely selfintersect, for instance in the bend of an elbow or knee, or where the arm or hand rests against the body. Cloth that becomes pinched in these regions is often forced into jagged self-intersections that defeat history-based methods, leaving a tangled mess when the body parts separate. This paper describes a history-free cloth collision response algorithm based on global intersection <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> meshes at each simulation step. The algorithm resolves tangles that arise during pinching as soon as the surrounding geometry permits, and also resolves tangled initial conditions. The ability to untangle cloth after pinching is not sufficient, because standard clothsolid collision algorithms handle pinches so poorly that they often give rise to visible flutters and other simulation artifacts during the pinch. As a companion to the global intersection analysis method, we present a cloth-solid collision algorithm called collision flypapering, that eliminates these artifacts. The two algorithms presented have been used together extensively and successfully in a production animation environment...|$|E

Although significant cloth appearance modeling research exists, light reflectance {{has not been}} a focus. For many graphics applications, replicating the motion and/or texture <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> coupled with a general reflectance model has been sufficient. For physical accuracy, however, correctly modeling how light interacts with a material is a necessity. Part of the difficulty in developing and verifying physically accurate models is scarcity of data. This thesis presents and examines reflectance data covering a breadth <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> materials acquired with the UCSD Spherical Gantry. Over 30 different types <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> were measured in total, made {{of some of the most}} common fibers such as cotton, linen, rayon, silk, wool, nylon, and polyester.

Through numerical errors and function plots, the conclusion is that while some models are sufficient for some cloth materials, most textiles exhibit complex reflectance properties that are not accounted for. Furthermore, BRDF data can vary greatly within the family of textiles depending on numerous variables such as fiber class, thread structure, fabrication method, and finishin...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to woven-cloth simu-lation in order to generate persistent wrinkles and folds. For a couple of decades, our community has identified and mimicked non-linear buckling <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> based on the mechanical measure-ment <b>of</b> <b>cloth.</b> It has, however, scarcely paid attention to another {{important aspect of the}} measurement, the hysteresis <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> be-haviors, which is the lag of the amount of forces between stress and relaxation. Our interpretation of the measurement indicates that persistent wrinkles and folds develop in part from the hyste-resis <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> and its associated energy loss. Thus, we establish an adaptive energy model which takes stiffness coefficients and rest posture values not as constants but as variables over time and behavior. As stiffness coefficients and rest posture values change in proportion to the amount of the energy loss, they appear as persistent wrinkles and folds. Consequently, the clothes simulated by our method bring more realism with respect to visual identi-fication for past behaviors <b>of</b> <b>cloth...</b>|$|R
