5|$|In 2007, {{proposals}} {{to abolish the}} five district councils in favour of <b>a</b> <b>unitary</b> authority (covering the existing two-tier county) were rejected following local opposition. West Somerset is the least populous district (except for the two sui generis districts) in England. In September 2016, West Somerset and Taunton Deane councils agreed in principle to merge the districts into one (with one council) subject to consultation. It is planned to achieve this on 1 April 2019 with the first elections to the new council in May 2019. The new district would not be <b>a</b> <b>unitary</b> authority, with Somerset County Council still performing its functions.|$|E

25|$|Northampton {{was granted}} modern borough status in 1974, {{when it was}} reconstituted as a non-metropolitan district, a {{subdivision}} of its non-metropolitan county (Northamptonshire). The town retains a two-tier structure of local government: the non-metropolitan district of Northampton is administered by both Northampton Borough Council and Northamptonshire County Council, which are both controlled by the Conservative Party. The borough failed to become <b>an</b> <b>unitary</b> authority in the 1990s local government reform and again, in 2011, when the motion was voted down by the council. However, in 2016, the borough council and all seven Northamptonshire MPs proposed to draw up plans for Northampton to become <b>an</b> <b>unitary</b> authority.|$|R
5|$|Peterborough City Council is {{the local}} {{authority}} for Peterborough in the East of England. It is <b>a</b> <b>unitary</b> authority, having the powers of a non-metropolitan county and district council combined. The City was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1874; from 1888, it fell within {{the jurisdiction of the}} Soke of Peterborough county council and from 1965, Huntingdon and Peterborough county council. In 1974, it was replaced by a wholly new non-metropolitan district, broadly corresponding to the Soke, in the new enlarged Cambridgeshire. In 1998, Peterborough became independent of Cambridgeshire as <b>a</b> <b>unitary</b> authority, but the city continues to form part of that county for ceremonial purposes as defined by the Lieutenancies Act 1997.|$|E

5|$|The AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} resolves {{the black}} hole information paradox, {{at least to some}} extent, because it shows how a black hole can evolve {{in a manner consistent with}} quantum mechanics in some contexts. Indeed, one can consider black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. These particles obey the usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular evolve in <b>a</b> <b>unitary</b> fashion, so {{the black hole}} must also evolve in <b>a</b> <b>unitary</b> fashion, respecting the principles of quantum mechanics. In 2005, Hawking announced that the paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by the AdS/CFT correspondence, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we study a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output {{wireless}} system where the channel state information is partially {{available at the}} transmitter through a feedback link. Based on Singular Value Decomposition, the MIMO channel is split into independent sub-channels which allows separate, and therefore, efficient decoding of the transmitted data signal. Effective feedback of the required spatial channel information entails efficient quantization/encoding of <b>a</b> Haar <b>unitary</b> matrix. The parameter reduction of <b>an</b> <b>unitary</b> matrix to its####### basic parameters is performed through Givens decomposition. We prove that Givens matrices of <b>a</b> Haar <b>unitary</b> matrix are statistically independent. Subsequently, we derive the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of the corresponding matrix elements. Based on these analyses, an efficient quantization scheme is proposed...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} lower bounding {{the maximum}} achievable rate of <b>a</b> differential <b>unitary</b> spacetime transmission {{subject to a}} prescribed performance. We characterize the performance using a suitably defined distance between two unitary matrices, which was previously obtained through pairwise error probability analysis. Considering the set of all unitary or orthogonal matrices as a compact manifold with some invariant volume form or kinematic density, we derive a Varshamov-Gilbert type lower bound on the transmission rate, which asserts the existence of <b>a</b> differential <b>unitary</b> space-time code with the given minimum diversity product for certain rates. On the way to obtaining this bound, the probability density function and the cumulative distribution function for the distance between <b>a</b> random <b>unitary</b> matrix and <b>a</b> fixed <b>unitary</b> matrix are also obtained in closed form in terms of Meijer G-functions...|$|R
