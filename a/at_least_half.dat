5|$|The {{clouds of}} Venus {{are capable of}} {{producing}} lightning much like the clouds on Earth. The existence of lightning had been controversial outside of the former Soviet Union since the first suspected bursts were detected by the Soviet Venera probes. However, in 2006–2007 Venus Express was reported to detect whistler mode waves, which were attributed to lightning. Their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity. The lightning rate is <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>half</b> of that on Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{clouds of}} Venus may {{be capable of}} {{producing}} lightning. The existence of lightning in the atmosphere of Venus has been controversial since the first suspected bursts were detected by the Soviet Venera probes. In 2006–07, Venus Express clearly detected whistler mode waves, the signatures of lightning. Their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity. According to these measurements, the lightning rate is <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>half</b> of that on Earth. In 2007, Venus Express discovered that a huge double atmospheric vortex exists at the south pole.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} factor that negatively affects maintenance is the low and irregular pay that soldiers receive, resulting in the theft and sale of spare parts and even basic equipment to supplement their meager salaries. When not stealing spare parts and equipment, maintenance personnel often spend {{the better part of}} their duty day looking for other ways to profit. American maintenance teams working in Zaire found that providing a free lunch to the work force was a good, sometimes the only, technique to motivate personnel to work <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>half</b> of the duty day.|$|E

Power cuts were reported in <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>half</b> of Fiji including Suva and Nadi however power was quickly restored to these areas. Within Fiji over 340 people evacuated to 61 evacuation centres which were opened by the Fijian government. There was also 61 houses completely flattened by cyclone Gene.|$|E
5|$|By October 2007, Vildanden was {{in severe}} {{financial}} distress. An agreement {{was made with}} the municipal council, where the latter gave a credit loan to the airline. The route to Molde had given large deficits, and the company was forced to close it down. NOK2.3 million, equal to the airlines debt to the airport, was granted to the municipal-owned airport operator, and the company allowed to make an agreement where half the debt was deleted, {{and the other half}} made interest and principal-free for two years. At the same time, the management of Vildanden had to raise new capital equal to <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>half</b> the companies accounts payable, which was NOK8 million. The case raised local debate about whether it was the municipality's job to subsidize the airport and the airline. The Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries announced that they would consider reporting the subsidies to the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) for violation of the European Community competition law.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{construction}} due to Chv'atal, Graham, Perold and Whitesides for making partitionable graphs with circular symetry. It {{is known that}} this construction doesn't produce any counter-example to Berge's conjecture. Grinstead conjectured that any circular partitionable graph is generated by this construction. This question is still open. Bacs'o, Boros, Gurvich, Maffray and Preissmann proved that every minimally imperfect graph with circular symmetry must have an odd number of vertices. Here we prove that every minimally imperfect graph with circular symmetry doesn't have two distinct maximum cliques sharing <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one <b>half</b> of their vertices and two distinct maximum stable sets sharing <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one <b>half</b> of their vertices...|$|R

5|$|Dunstan pursued similar reforms {{with respect}} to Indigenous Australians. In 1962, the Aboriginal Affairs Bill was {{introduced}} to liberalise constraints that had been placed on Indigenous Australians {{in the past and}} had effectively resulted in segregation. The initial proposal still retained some restrictions, placing more controls over full-blooded Aborigines. Dunstan was prominent in Labor's opposition to the double standards, and called for abolition of race-based restrictions, saying that social objectives could be achieved without explicit colour-based schemes. He was successful in forcing amendments to liberalise controls on property and the confinement of Indigenous Australians to reserves. However, his attempt to remove the different standards required of part and full-blooded Aborigines failed, as did his proposal to ensure that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>half</b> {{of the members of the}} Aboriginal Affairs Board be Indigenous Australians. Despite the passage of the bill, restrictions remained in place and Dunstan questioned the policy of assimilation of Aborigines, which he saw as the diluting of their distinctive cultures.|$|E
5|$|Labradors like to eat, {{and without}} proper {{exercise}} can become obese. Laziness is {{a contribution to}} this. Obesity is a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight. Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, {{and can lead to}} secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>half</b> an hour.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} debates on the actual taking of the Bastille in 1789 has been {{the nature of the}} crowds that stormed the building. Hippolyte Taine argued in the late 19th century that the crowd {{consisted}} of unemployed vagrants, who acted without real thought; by contrast, the post-war left-wing intellectual George Rudé argued that the crowd was dominated by relatively prosperous artisan workers. The matter was reexamined by Jacques Godechot in the post-war years; Godechot showing convincingly that, in addition to some local artisans and traders, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>half</b> the crowd that gathered that day were, like the inhabitants of the surrounding faubourg, recent immigrants to Paris from the provinces. Godechot used this to characterise the taking of the Bastille as a genuinely national event of wider importance to French society.|$|E

5|$|The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles {{had their}} {{origins in the}} Indian {{independence}} movement, which strove to achieve the values of liberty and social welfare as the goals of an independent Indian state. The development of constitutional rights in India was inspired by historical documents such as England's Bill of Rights, the United States Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man. The demand for civil liberties formed {{an important part of}} the Indian independence movement, with one of the objectives of the Indian National Congress (INC) being to end discrimination between the British rulers and their Indian subjects. This demand was explicitly mentioned in resolutions adopted by the INC between 1917 and 1919. The demands articulated in these resolutions included granting to Indians the rights to equality before law, free speech, trial by juries composed <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>half</b> of Indian members, political power, and equal terms for bearing arms as British citizens.|$|E
5|$|The {{perpetrators}} were apprehended in 1989 {{under the}} administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Moro and Zorrilla were sentenced to 25 and 35 years in prison respectively, but were released from prison in February 2009 for good conduct after serving <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>half</b> of their sentences. Several public intellectuals, journalists, press freedom organizations, newspapers, and politicians protested their releases. Zorrilla returned to prison later that year after he failed to provide a formal letter petitioning his release. On 10 September 2013, Zorrilla {{was released from prison}} after a Mexico City judge granted him the opportunity to fulfill the remaining years of his sentence at his residence due to unstable health conditions. The Mexican government closed the case after the arrests, but many journalists doubted the results of the investigation and believed that the masterminds behind the murder case remained at large.|$|E
