40|$|Abstract. A new {{interpretation}} of rules in {{rough set theory}} is introduced. According to the positive, boundary, and negative regions of a set, one can make a three-way decision: accept, abstain and reject. The three regions enable us to derive three types of decision rules, namely, positive rules for <b>acceptance,</b> <b>boundary</b> rules for indecision or delayed decision, and negative rules for rejection. Within the decision-theoretic rough set model, the associated costs of rules are analyzed. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of application of acoustic holographic analysis with statistical envelope analysis algorithm for vehicle side mirror power-fold (PF) noise diagnostic is explored. The {{aim of this}} paper is to establish whether the sound visualization contours derived from the measurements can be used as a basis for the power-fold quality differentiation, and whether the results of noise source localization can suggest the best locations for signal sensor placement(s). With use of the acoustic camera, the diagnostic algorithm of the statistical envelope analysis is developed and validated using a large number of power-fold actuators comprising of subjectively &# 039;good&# 039; and &# 039;bad&# 039; samples. These power-fold actuators were tested and measured for the sound pressure spectra over the 1 / 3 rd octave band over the frequency range up to 6300 Hz. Power-fold noise was measured by use of the microphone array. For given frequency limits of 1 / 3 rd octave bands, sound pressure levels are measured on given power-fold actuators, an envelope algorithm was formed for the subjectively &# 039;good&# 039; actuators, thus allowing to develop a quality control <b>acceptance</b> <b>boundary</b> envelope, with which, sound pressure spectrum amplitude of each individual actuator was compared. When the actuators have sound pressure spectrum amplitude curves falling within this boundary envelope, a pass status is obtained, and when the sound pressure spectrum amplitude curves stay outside of this envelope, a fail status is given...|$|E
40|$|During {{the decay}} process {{the shape of}} wake {{vortices}} changes significantly which {{has an influence on}} the encounter characteristics, hence on the encounter hazard. In order to evaluate the influence of vortex deformation on the wake encounter hazard, in-flight simulations with the DLR research aircraft ATTAS were carried out. For a realistic analysis of wake encounters flow fields of matured vortices were generated with large eddy simulations. These flow fields were used for the determination of histories of induced forces and moments acting on the wake encountering aircraft. The force and moment histories were then fed into the equations of motions of the non-linear six degree-of-freedom in-flight simulation of the DLR research aircraft ATTAS. In order to compare different stages of vortex deformation, encounters were simulated in flight with wavy vortices and vortex rings. The most important benefit of the in-flight-simulation is the realistic environment, which enables a realistic assessment of pilots’ encounter acceptance. The analysed scenario was of a wake encounter during final approach. The encounter conditions correspond to separation distances of about 4 nm and 5 nm behind an aircraft of the “heavy” category. During the encounters the ATTAS was flown under manual control. Altogether 31 encounters were simulated in flight, 9 with wavy vortices and 22 with vortex rings. The analysis of the results shows that with increasing vortex deformation the encounter impact acts increasingly in all degrees of freedom. Apparently, pilots assess roll-dominated encounters as more dangerous, which is why the unacceptability threshold is higher for encounters with vortex rings than for those with wavy vortices. Besides this unacceptability boundary, a harmlessness boundary can be determined, which seems to be independent from the degree of vortex deformation. This is a most important outcome of the flight test described in this paper. Although, due to the very limited number of flight tests performed, no clear correlation between the pilot ratings and objective measures could be assessed, an <b>acceptance</b> <b>boundary</b> for the roll control ratio could be determined below which the effects of vortex deformation seem to be negligible...|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of the long-term memory colours of objects {{has been the subject}} of investigation for many years. Colour <b>acceptance</b> <b>boundaries</b> have been determined from the visual assessments of objects under variable illumination or by presenting manipulated images of objects on a calibrated computer display. However, a systematic and quantitative rating of the colour of real objects with respect to memory colour is not available at this moment. In this paper, nine familiar real objects with colours distributed around the hue circle, were positioned in a specially designed LED illumination box. For each object, approximately hundred real illumination spectra were synthesised in a random order keeping the luminance of the object approximately constant. Observers were asked to rate, on a five-point scale, the similarity of the perceived object colour to their idea of what the object looked like in reality. By avoiding specular reflections the observer was unable to identify any clues as to the colour of the illumination. For each object, similarity ratings showed a good intra- and inter-observer agreement. The ratings of all the observers were pooled and successfully modelled in IPT colour space by a bivariate Gaussian distribution. It was found that the chromaticity corresponding to the highest rating tended to be shifted towards higher chroma in comparison with the chromaticity calculated under D 65 illumination. The bivariate distributions could be very useful in applications where the quantitative evaluation of the colour appearance of an object stimulus is required, such as in the evaluation of the colour rendering capabilities of a light source. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Very high {{infestation}} {{levels of}} Thrips tabaci Lindeman were observed on onions at Ste-Clotilde (Quebec) with seasonal means of 149 and 161 thrips/plant for 1988 and 1989 respectively. No {{significant differences in}} thrips densities were detected among six yellow onion cultivars (Capable, Flame, Norstar, Progress, Rocket, Taurus) through weekly comparisons in 1988 and biweekly comparisons in 1989. A new variable, the cumulative number of thrips-days/plant, was used to model the impact of T. tabaci on onion yields. This variable allowed for better-fitted models, especially in 1989 where greater variability of the onion yields was observed. A modified Gompertz equation gave the best fit for 1988. No yield reduction due to T. tabaci was observed up to the 1000 cumulative thrips-days/plant point, beyond which the thrips impact first increased with the feeding pressure and then gradually decreased to a minimal level corresponding to a yield loss of 43 %. In 1989, thrips impact was immediate and best described by an exponential model with a maximal yield loss of 34, 5 %. Economic thresholds of 964 and 251 cumulative thrips-days/plant were calculated for 1988 and 1989 respectively. Converted to thrips/leaf these correspond to 2, 2 and 0, 9 thrips/leaf. This conversion could facilitate their use in a field situation. Spatial distribution of T. tabaci was analyzed in ten commercial onion fields. Within field, density was homogeneous {{in the majority of}} cases. In some fields, higher thrips densities were temporary (two consecutive weeks at most) in one or two field margins. The Iwao method was used to calculate the <b>acceptance</b> <b>boundaries</b> of sequential sampling plans for the economic thresholds of 0, 9 and 2, 2 thrips/leaf and onion growth stages of 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 green leaves.

5000|$|This <b>acceptance</b> of <b>boundaries</b> {{determined}} by the Nicholas Commission {{proved to be the}} movement's critical strategic error. It assumed that a state was not viable unless it was dominated by a large urban population on the English/London model. Yet, the evidence from similar federations like Canada and the USA revealed numerous successful [...] "farm states", like Wyoming, Montana and the Dakotas, with comparatively small capital city populations tied to a single, essentially rural community of interest. This metrocentric mindset ensured that two quite distinct communities of interest were being pressured into a doomed arranged marriage. It was also the very antithesis of an [...] "act of free choice" [...] as that choice involved imposing a majority rural will over a geographically distinct urban community. A new state proposal based in most part on boundaries formed by those Local Councils with majorities that actually wanted the change would have acquired a critical momentum.|$|R
