40|$|Abstract Background It is {{important}} to screen for alcohol consumption and drinking customs in a standardized manner. The {{aim of this study}} was 1) to investigate whether the <b>AUDIT</b> <b>score</b> <b>is</b> useful for predicting hazardous drinking using optimal cutoff scores and 2) to use multivariate analysis to evaluate whether the <b>AUDIT</b> <b>score</b> <b>was</b> more useful than pre-existing laboratory tests for predicting hazardous drinking. Methods A cross-sectional study using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was conducted in 334 outpatients who consulted our internal medicine department. The patients completed self-reported questionnaires and underwent a diagnostic interview, physical examination, and laboratory testing. Results Forty (23  %) male patients reported daily alcohol consumption[*]≥[*] 40  g, and 16 (10  %) female patients reported consumption[*]≥[*] 20  g. The optimal cutoff values of hazardous drinking were calculated using a 10 -fold cross validation, resulting in an optimal <b>AUDIT</b> <b>score</b> cutoff of 8. 2, with a sensitivity of 95. 5  %, specificity of 87. 0  %, false positive rate of 13. 0  %, false negative rate of 4. 5  %, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 97. Multivariate analysis revealed that the most popular short version of the AUDIT consisting solely of its three consumption items (AUDIT-C) and patient sex were significantly associated with hazardous drinking. The aspartate transaminase (AST) /alanine transaminase (ALT) ratio and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were weakly significant. Conclusions This study showed that the <b>AUDIT</b> <b>score</b> and particularly the AUDIT-C <b>score</b> <b>were</b> more useful than the AST/ALT ratio and MCV for predicting hazardous drinking...|$|R
40|$|Little {{research}} has been done examining the impact on police drinking patterns of routinely dealing with alcohol related incidents. The current study examined the drinking of a sample of employees of an Australian state police service (N = 4193) {{through the use of a}} survey including the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT [1]). The survey also requested officers to estimate the proportion and types of incidents to which they were called that involved alcohol. Analysis revealed that the median estimate, for all officers, of the proportion of incidents involving alcohol in their division was 50 % to 74 %. The median for operational officers was higher than that of non-operational officers. Operational officers estimated that 70 % of public disturbances, 80 % of domestic violence incidents, 70 % of noise complaints, and 70 % of assaults involved alcohol. From a possible range of 0 to 40, operational officers’ (n = 2941) mean <b>AUDIT</b> <b>score</b> <b>was</b> 7. 07, while non-operational officers’ (n = 1014) mean <b>AUDIT</b> <b>score</b> <b>was</b> significantly lower at 5. 48. Analysis revealed a significant relationship between dealing with alcohol related incidents and officers’ drinking patterns as measured by the AUDIT. Assault was the only type of incident to independently predict drinking behaviour.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the association between suicidal behavior and patterns of alcohol consumption in Korean adults. Methods: This study was based on data provided by the Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey from 2007 to 2011. A total of 42 347 subjects were included in the study, of whom 19 292 were male and 23 055 were female. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between patterns of alcohol consumption and suicidal behavior. Results: Among the study subjects, 1426 males (11. 3 %) and 3599 females (21. 2 %) had experienced suicidal ideation, and 106 males (0. 8 %) and 190 females (1. 1 %) had attempted suicide during the previous 12 months. Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (<b>AUDIT)</b> <b>scores</b> <b>were</b> found to be associated with suicidal ideation in males and associated with both suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in females. Alcoholic blackouts were associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in males, and were also associated with suicidal ideation in females. Conclusions: In this study, we found that certain patterns of alcohol consumption were associated with suicidal behaviors. In particular, only alcoholic blackouts and categorized <b>AUDIT</b> <b>scores</b> <b>were</b> found to be associated with suicidal behavior in males.

40|$|Hyperprolactinaemia in {{antipsychotic}} treated {{patients with}} schizophrenia {{is a consequence}} of D 2 receptor (DRD 2) blockade. Alcohol use disorder is commonly comorbid with schizophrenia and low availability of striatal DRD 2 may predispose individuals to alcohol use. In this pilot study we investigated whether hyperprolactinaemia secondary to pharmacological DRD 2 blockade was associated with alcohol use disorder in 219 (178 males and 41 females) patients with schizophrenia. Serum prolactin determinations were made in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and maintained on antipsychotic agents. Clinical assessment included demographics, family history and administration of the AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test). Higher <b>AUDIT</b> <b>scores</b> <b>were</b> associated with prolactin-raising antipsychotic medication (n¼ 106) compared with prolactin sparing medication (n¼ 113). Risperidone (n¼ 63) treated patients had higher <b>AUDIT</b> <b>scores</b> and prolactin levels than those on other atypical antipsychotics (n¼ 113). Across the entire sample, patients with a prolactin greater than 800 mIU/L had higher <b>AUDIT</b> <b>scores</b> and <b>were</b> more likely to exceed the cut-off score for harmful and hazardous alcohol use. These differences were not explained by potential confounds related to clinical features and demographics, comorbidity or medication side-effects. These data suggest that by lowering dosage, or switching to another antipsychotic agent, the risk for alcohol use disorder in those with schizophrenia may be reduced.

Materials and methods: This was a cross-sectional study of the data for 940 women who became menopausal within the 3 years preceding the KNHANES. Results: The numbers of nondrinkers, mild to moderate drinkers, and heavy drinkers in this group were 345 (34. 7 %), 573 (62. 2 %), and 22 (3 %). Body mass index (BMI), smoking, and exercise were adjusted in model 1 and age was additionally adjusted in model 2. The mean ages at menopause were 51. 6  ±  0. 2, 50. 8  ±  0. 1, and 50. 4  ±  0. 5 years (p =  0. 0025) in model 1 and 51. 7  ±  0. 2, 51. 1  ±  0. 1, and 50. 1  ±  0. 5 years (p =  0. 0018) in model 2 for nondrinkers, mild to moderate drinkers, and heavy drinkers, respectively. BMI, smoking, exercise, educational level, income, duration of menopause, age at menarche, age at first delivery, and gravidity were adjusted in model 3, and the respective mean ages at menopause were 51. 3  ±  0. 2, 50. 7  ±  0. 2, and 50. 1  ±  0. 8 years (p =  0. 0402).

40|$|In {{the year}} 2000, the alcohol habits of 1460 Swedish {{university}} students living in residence halls were assessed. The students {{had a mean}} age of 23. 8 years, and 64 % were male. The results from this baseline assessment show that the mean <b>AUDIT</b> <b>score</b> (± sd) <b>was</b> 10. 3 ± 5. 2 for males and 8. 1 ± 4. 7 for females. AUDIT stands for Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and is used world-wide to assess alcohol habits. Scores equal to or above eight for males, and equal to or above four for females indicate an at-risk drinking pattern. It <b>was</b> shown that <b>AUDIT</b> <b>scores</b> <b>were</b> correlated with high levels of Distance and Expressiveness in the social climate of the residence halls, assessed by the students themselves. The students were cluster randomised (with the residence hall as the cluster unit) into three groups. One group received a three hour cognitive-based harm reduction education (called BSTP), and one group received a three hour lecture by therapists trained in twelve-step philosophy (called TSI). The third group did not receive any intervention. The students were then monitored for three years. All students answering the questionnaires received a short personalized feedback, independently of randomisation group. The two-year assessment showed that all groups had reduced their <b>AUDIT</b> <b>scores.</b> When assessing only those who belonged to the at-risk drinking group, the students in the BSTP group reduced their <b>AUDIT</b> <b>scores</b> significantly more than the students in the control group (a reduction of 3. 9 and 2. 8 points, respectively, p< 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference between}} the TSI group and the BSTP or control group, with a reduction in the TSI group of 3. 0 points. Furthermore it could be seen that more students participated in the BSTP education than in the TSI lecture (63 % versus 25 %, p< 0. 001). Using trajectory analyses on all assessment points, five different trajectory groups could be identified with AUDIT. All slopes showed reduction of <b>AUDIT</b> <b>scores</b> over time. No women could be found in the highest AUDIT trajectory group, which also included younger persons. The students were also compared with students in other parts of Sweden and in the US, and similar moderators of drinking patterns could be found, although country was of importance. To conclude, in mean all students reduced their drinking over time. This reduction could be further reduced by participation in a harm reduction education for the students having an at-risk drinking pattern. The social climate of the residence halls and the students’ drinking habits are correlated, as are the students’ country of residence...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between athlete drinking motives and hazardous drinking across differing levels of sporting participation (club vs elite-provincial vs elite-international). Methods: Data from 1214 New Zealand sports people was collected. We assessed hazardous drinking with the WHO's AUDIT questionnaire and sportspeople's psychosocial reasons for drinking with the ADS. Level of sporting participation (club/social, provincial/state, or international/ olympic level) was also assessed. Results: Hazardous drinking behaviours differed across levels of sporting participation, with elite-provincial sportspeople showing the highest level of hazardous drinking, club/social sportspeople the next highest and elite-international sportspeople the lowest. Sportspeople who placed a greater emphasis on drinking as a reward for participating in their sports tended to display more hazardous drinking behaviours, but other ADS motives differed over level of sporting participation. Elite-provincial sportspeople and elite-international sportspeople placed more emphasis on drinking as a way to cope with the stresses of participating in their sports. A relationship between team/group motives and <b>AUDIT</b> <b>scores</b> <b>was</b> fully mediated by positive reinforcement motives, and partially mediated by stress-related coping motives. Conclusions: These findings have implications for alcohol education programs targeted at sportspeople and sport administration, and may help improve the efficacy and focus of intervention programs...|$|R
40|$|Using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) as {{the gold}} standard, the Fast Alcohol Screening Test (FAST) was {{developed}} for use in busy medical settings. AUDIT questionnaires were completed by 666 patients in two London accident & emergency (A&E) departments. Using a principal components analysis, as well as sensitivity and specificity indices, a two-stage screening test was developed, using four of the AUDIT items. The first stage involved one item that identified > 50 % of patients as either hazardous or non-hazardous drinkers. The second stage made use {{of the other three}} items to categorize the rest. The performance of this four-item questionnaire was then tested across a range of settings. Opportunistic samples of 100 patients completed AUDIT questionnaires in each of the following National Health Service settings: A&E department, fracture clinic, primary health centre and a dental hospital. It was concluded that the four-item FAST questionnaire had good sensitivity and specificity, across a range of settings, when the <b>AUDIT</b> <b>score</b> <b>was</b> used as the gold standard. The FAST questionnaire is quick to administer, since > 50 % of patients are categorized using just one question...|$|R
40|$|Background/AimsThe aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{clinical}} impacts of obesity and hazardous alcohol use on the outcome of entecavir (ETV) therapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. MethodsThe medical records of 88 treatment-naïve patients who were diagnosed with CHB and received ETV between March 2007 and September 2009 were analyzed retrospectively. Body mass index (BMI) values and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (<b>AUDIT)</b> <b>scores</b> <b>were</b> obtained at 6 months after the initiation of ETV (0. 5 mg daily) treatment. ResultsA BMI of 25 kg/m 2 or more was recognized as an indicator of obesity, and a total <b>AUDIT</b> <b>score</b> of 8 or more was recognized as an indicator of hazardous alcohol use. Of the cohort, 24 patients (27. 3 %) were obese and 17 (19. 3 %) were hazardous alcohol users. The rate of seroconversion, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) -DNA negativity (< 300 copies/mL) at 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment did not differ significantly between the normal-BMI and high-BMI groups. Moreover, the rate of seroconversion and HBV-DNA negativity at 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment did not differ significantly between the nonhazardous and hazardous alcohol users. However, the frequency of ALT normalization at 12 months was significantly lower among hazardous alcohol users (91. 5 % vs. 70. 6 %; P= 0. 033). ConclusionsObesity and hazardous alcohol drinking have no significant impact on the outcome of ETV treatment. However, the ALT normalization rate at 12 months after initiation of ETV treatment was significantly lower among the hazardous alcohol users...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Alcohol misuse is more {{prevalent}} among military populations. Association between PTSD and heavy drinking {{have been reported}} in many studies. Most of the studies on alcohol use among military personnel are from US and UK. Aim {{of this study is to}} describe alcohol consumption patterns among military personnel in Sri Lanka, a country where the alcohol consumption among the general population are very different to that in US and UK. Methods Cross sectional study consisting of representative samples of Sri Lanka Navy Special Forces and regular forces deployed in combat areas continuously during a one year period was carried out. Data was collected using a self report questionnaire. Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) was used to assess alcohol consumption. Results Sample consisted of 259 Special Forces and 412 regular navy personnel. The median <b>AUDIT</b> <b>score</b> <b>was</b> 2. 0 (interquartile range 6. 0). Prevalence of current drinking was 71. 2 [*]%. Of the current users 54. 81 [*]% were infrequent users (frequency[*]≤[*]once a month) while 37. 87 [*]% of users consumed 2 – 4 times a month. Prevalence of hazardous drinking (AUDIT[*]≥[*] 8) was 16. 69 [*]% and binge drinking 14. 01 [*]%. Five (0. 75 [*]%) had AUDIT total ≥ 20. There was no significant difference between Special Forces and regular forces in hazardous drinking or binge drinking. Total <b>AUDIT</b> <b>score</b> ≥ 16 <b>were</b> associated with difficulty performing work. Conclusions High rates of hazardous drinking and binge drinking described among military personnel in US and UK were not seen among SLN personnel deployed in combat areas. This finding contrasts with previously reported association between combat exposure and hazardous alcohol use among military personnel. Alcohol use among military personnel may be significantly influenced by alcohol consumption patterns among the general population, access to alcohol and attitudes about alcohol use. Similar to findings from other countries, heavy alcohol use was associated with poorer psychological health and functional impairment. </p...|$|R
