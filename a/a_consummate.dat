5|$|Final Fantasy VI {{features}} fourteen permanent playable characters, {{the most}} of any game in the main series, as well as several secondary characters who are only briefly controlled by the player. The starting character, Terra Branford, is a reserved half-human, half-esper girl who spent most of her life as a slave to the Empire, thanks to a mind-controlling device, and is unfamiliar with love. Other primary characters include Locke Cole, a treasure hunter and rebel sympathizer with a powerful impulse to protect women; Celes Chere, a former general of the Empire, who joined the Returners after being jailed for questioning imperial practices; Edgar Roni Figaro, <b>a</b> <b>consummate</b> womanizer and the king of Figaro, who claims allegiance to the Empire while secretly supplying aid to the Returners; Sabin Rene Figaro, Edgar's brother, who fled the royal court in order to pursue his own path and hone his martial arts skills; Cyan Garamonde, a loyal knight to the kingdom of Doma who lost his family and friends as a result of Kefka poisoning the kingdom's water supply; Setzer Gabbiani, a habitual gambler and thrill seeker and owner of the world's only airship; Shadow, a ninja mercenary, who offers his services to both the Empire and the Returners at various stages throughout the game; Relm Arrowny, a young but tough artistic girl with magical powers; Strago Magus, Relm's elderly grandfather and a Blue Mage; Gau, a feral child surviving since infancy in the harsh wilderness known as the Veldt; Mog, a Moogle from the mines of Narshe; Umaro, a savage but loyal sasquatch also from Narshe, talked into joining the Returners through Mog's persuasion; and Gogo, a mysterious, fully shrouded master of the art of mimicry.|$|E
25|$|In his {{personal}} life, Alma-Tadema was an extrovert {{and had a}} remarkably warm personality. He had most {{of the characteristics of}} a child, coupled with the admirable traits of <b>a</b> <b>consummate</b> professional. A perfectionist, he remained in all respects a diligent, if somewhat obsessive and pedantic worker. He was an excellent businessman, and one of the wealthiest artists of the nineteenth century. Alma-Tadema was as firm in money matters as he was with the quality of his work.|$|E

50|$|During {{the reign}} of his brother King Ferdinand II, Antonio quickly became known for his restless behavior. By age sixteen 1832, he was already <b>a</b> <b>consummated</b> womanizer. In 1837, Ferdinand II {{arranged}} his marriage to Louise Marie Thérèse d'Artois, his niece, a daughter of his half sister Caroline, Duchess of Berry. The marriage negotiation failed as the Duchess of Angoulême opposed the union.|$|R
50|$|Margaret Bourchier {{was married}} three times. Her first husband, with whom there may {{only have been}} a {{marriage}} agreement (a ‘pre-contract’), was Sir John Sandes (or Sandys). The marriage agreement was signed when Margaret was 10 or 11 years old on 11 November 1478. Pre-contracts were not unusual among the Tudor period aristocracy and gentry, and it need not have resulted in <b>a</b> <b>consummated</b> marriage.|$|R
25|$|At {{the age of}} 32, Olsen {{was moved}} back to the libero position, which {{transformed}} him from an established player to an international star-player. Olsen employed a wide variety of skills for a defensive player, including attacking surges and technical dribbling, taking advantage of his acceleration and vision of the game. He provided long passes from his deep position, while his forward surges helped create numerical advantages in the midfield. He was <b>a</b> <b>consummate</b> professional, known as a gentleman of the game.|$|E
25|$|Sivaji Ganesan is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} best Indian actors of all time. He was also acknowledged as <b>a</b> <b>consummate</b> actor and one of the most imitated ones. He was praised for his body language and his resounding voice and dialogue delivery. Ganesan is known for his versatility and has acted as a blind man, a physically handicapped person in Bhaagapirivinai, a man with a scarred face as in Deiva Magan, a murderer in Pudhiya Paravai, or a traitor as in Andha Naal which had no songs at all.|$|E
25|$|Wayne Malloy (Eddie Izzard) – Wayne is the {{paternal}} {{head of the}} Malloy family (not to {{be confused}} with the extended Malloy 'clan'). He is <b>a</b> <b>consummate,</b> intelligent grifter and thief who experienced an 'existential crisis' while his wife was serving time in prison. He has become disillusioned with the nomadic, scamming lifestyle of the Travellers; it was his idea to steal the identities of deceased Doug and Cherien Rich and settle down into a normal life. Dahlia has referred to him as a 'halfbreed' or 'half buffer', because he did not come from a Traveller bloodline.|$|E
5000|$|The {{story has}} been read as a {{confession}} or parable about James' own life. He never married and possibly never experienced <b>a</b> <b>consummated</b> sexual relationship. Although he did enjoy a thorough experience of aesthetic creativity, {{it is possible that}} he still regretted what he called the [...] "essential loneliness" [...] of his life. This biographical relevance adds another level of meaning to [...] "The Beast in the Jungle." ...|$|R
50|$|One popular {{source of}} {{legislation}} that was first brought forward in 1991 and became national law in 2003 is the Child Rights Act. Among other factors {{to protect children from}} abuses and discrimination, Section 21 and 23 of the act made it illegal to marry off a child below the age of 18. If <b>a</b> husband <b>consummates</b> <b>a</b> marriage with a child, it is considered rape.|$|R

Each of these developments is significant standing alone; collectively, they reflect extremely active Justice Department and FTC antitrust enforcement programs, with the agencies at times adopting more aggressive positions than some might have expected from a Republican administration...|$|R
25|$|If Philip II of Macedon had {{not been}} the father of Alexander the Great, he would be more widely known as a first-rate {{military}} innovator, tactician and strategist, and as <b>a</b> <b>consummate</b> politician. The conquests of Alexander {{would have been impossible}} without the army his father created. Considered semi-barbarous by some metropolitan Greeks, the Macedonians were a martial people; they drank deeply of unwatered wine (the very mark of a barbarian) and no youth was considered to be fit to sit with the men at table until he had killed, on foot with a spear, a wild boar.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the novel}} is set {{during the time of the}} Risorgimento, {{specifically}} during the period when Giuseppe Garibaldi, the hero of Italian unification, swept through Sicily with his forces, known as The Thousand. The plot focuses upon the aristocratic Salina family, which is headed by the stoic Prince Fabrizio, <b>a</b> <b>consummate</b> womanizer who foresees the upcoming downfall of his family and the nobility in Italy as a whole but finds himself unable to change the course of history. As the novel opens in May 1860, Garibaldi's Redshirts have landed on the Sicilian coast and are pressing inland to overthrow the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} {{nineteen}} Isaac {{was sent}} to the Academy of Geneva, where he read Greek under Franciscus Portus a Cretan. Portus died in 1581, recommending Casaubon, then only twenty-two, as his successor. He remained at Geneva as professor of Greek until 1596. There he married twice, his second wife being Florence Estienne, daughter of the scholar-printer Henri Estienne. At Geneva, Casaubon lacked example, encouragement and assistance and struggled against the troops of the Catholic dukes of Savoy, but became <b>a</b> <b>consummate</b> Greek and classical scholar. He spent all the money he could spare on books, including copying classics that were not then in print. Even though Henri Estienne, Theodore de Beza (rector of the university and professor of theology), and Jacques Lect (Lectius), were men of superior learning, they often had no time for Casaubon.|$|E

25|$|Killam {{moved with}} his family, {{wife and three}} children, to Laredo in 1920, when Radcliffe was ten years of age. His father had come to south Texas to {{prospect}} for petroleum and natural gas on mineral leases that he had acquired while in business in Oklahoma. The third Killam well brought about an oil boom in Mirando City in eastern Webb County in 1921, nearly a decade before the better known East Texas Oil Boom centered about Kilgore. Killam {{grew up in the}} oil fields and spent his summers on the rigs. He graduated in 1932 from Laredo High School, now Martin High School. He played on the former Laredo polo team and was <b>a</b> <b>consummate</b> horseman, who never complained, even when being thrown from a horse. Killam procured a bachelor's degree from the University of Texas at Austin and a law degree from Harvard Law School.|$|E
25|$|The flying replicas were {{specifically}} {{chosen to}} be different enough that an ordinary audience member could distinguish them. They were all types reputed to have flown well, in or about 1910. In most cases this worked well, {{but there were a}} few surprises, adding to an accurate historical reassessment of the aircraft concerned. For example, in its early form, the replica of the Santos-Dumont Demoiselle, a forerunner of today's ultralight aircraft, was unable to leave the ground except in short hops. Extending the wingspan and fitting a more powerful Ardem 50hp engine produced only marginal improvement. When Doug Bianchi and the Personal Planes production staff who constructed the replica consulted with Allen Wheeler, he recalled that the Demoiselle's designer and first pilot, Alberto Santos-Dumont was a very short, slightly built man. A suitably small pilot, Joan Hughes, a wartime member of the Air Transport Auxiliary who was the Airways Flying Club chief instructor, was hired. With the reduced payload, the diminutive Demoiselle flew very well, and Hughes proved <b>a</b> <b>consummate</b> stunt flyer, able to undertake exacting manoeuvres.|$|E
25|$|Fregoli took London by storm. He did quick-fire performances, impersonating Wagner, Rossini, Verdi and Paderewski {{one after}} another. He would exit stage left as a street {{musician}} and appear almost immediately stage right as a woman. Everybody - including the great actors and performers of the day, such as Dan Leno - {{wanted to see}} him, and his run was extended and extended, as was the seating in the theatre; not bad for someone who didn't even speak English. The general view of him was that, apart from his obvious abilities as a quick change artist he was - unlike his rivals - <b>a</b> <b>consummate</b> actor and a brilliant writer. He gave private performances for royalty and aristocrats (such as the Rothschilds, for whom he calmly explained all of his tricks). He inspired a host of imitators, male and female. Every theatre in London soon had its protean artist; even Biondi was there, performing at the same time. There were spoofers and parodists: journalists claimed tipsy theatregoers were demanding their money back upon discovering that all the performers they had just witnessed were actually just one man.|$|E
60|$|We need follow {{no further}} {{the story of}} <b>a</b> <b>consummated</b> degradation. Charles threw off one by one, on grounds of {{baseless}} suspicion, Lord George Murray, Kelly (to please Lord Marischal), Goring, and now drove from him his most attached servants. He never suspected Glengarry. But neither time, nor despair, nor Charles's own fallen self could kill the loyalty of Scotland. Bishop Forbes, far away, heard of his crowning folly, and--blamed Lumisden and his companion, Hay of Restalrig! When Charles, on Good Friday, 1772, married Louise of Stolberg, the remnant of the faithful in Scotland drank to 'the fairest Fair,' and to an heir of the Crown.|$|R

She later elevated Caesarion, her son with Caesar, to co-ruler in name.|$|R

25|$|He had {{excellent}} parts, {{which had}} been improved by parliamentary and diplomatic experience; but the infirmities of his temper detracted much from the effective strength of his abilities. Negotiator and courtier as he was, he never learnt the art of governing or of concealing his emotions. When prosperous, he was insolent and boastful; when he sustained a check, his undisguised mortification doubled the triumph of his enemies: very slight provocations sufficed to kindle his anger; {{and when he was}} angry he said bitter things which he forgot {{as soon as he was}} pacified, but which others remembered many years. His quickness and penetration would have made him <b>a</b> <b>consummate</b> man of business but for his selfsufficiency and impatience. His writings prove that he had many of the qualities of an orator: but his irritability prevented him from doing himself justice in debate: for nothing was easier than to goad him into a passion; and, from the moment when he went into a passion, he was at the mercy of opponents far inferior to him in capacity. Unlike most of the leading politicians of that generation, he was a consistent, dogged, and rancorous party man, a Cavalier of the old school, a zealous champion of the Crown and of the Church, and a hater of Republicans and Nonconformists. He had consequently a great body of personal adherents. The clergy especially looked on him as their own man, and extended to his foibles an indulgence of which, to say the truth, he stood in some need, for he drank deep, and when was in a rage—and he very often was in a rage—he swore like a porter.|$|E
500|$|Critic Judith Thurman said in The New Yorker that, [...] "Riefenstahl's genius {{has rarely}} been questioned, even by critics who despise the service to which she lent it. Riefenstahl was <b>a</b> <b>consummate</b> stylist obsessed with bodies in motion, {{particularly}} those of dancers and athletes. Riefenstahl relies heavily for her transitions on portentous cutaways to clouds, mist, statuary, foliage, and rooftops. Her reaction shots have a tedious sameness: shining, ecstatic faces—nearly all young and Aryan, except for Hitler's".|$|E
500|$|Gary Barlow {{was called}} [...] "inspirational, brave and <b>a</b> <b>consummate</b> professional" [...] after {{performing}} despite {{his wife had}} a stillborn baby on 4 August. However, George Michael attracted some criticism for singing his new song [...] "White Light" [...] at the ceremony. Critics saw this as shameless promotion. [...] Michael replied {{that it was his}} one chance to thank his supporters, which he didn't regret. It was his first appearance since almost dying from pneumonia and [...] "White Light" [...] was about that experience. Appearances by Russell Brand, Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss were also seen as controversial, as their previous behaviour had not always reflected Olympic ideals.|$|E

500|$|According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a Greek {{historian}} and teacher of rhetoric, Demosthenes represented {{the final stage}} {{in the development of}} Attic prose. Both Dionysius and Cicero assert that Demosthenes brought together the best features of the basic types of style; he used the middle or normal type style ordinarily and applied the archaic type and the type of plain elegance where they were fitting. In each one of the three types he was better than its special masters.* C. Wooten, [...] "Cicero's Reactions to Demosthenes", 39. He is, therefore, regarded as <b>a</b> <b>consummate</b> orator, adept in the techniques of oratory, which are brought together in his work.|$|E
500|$|Edwin Carrington, the Secretary-General of the Caribbean Community, {{stated that}} Odlum [...] "served his country, St Lucia, with distinction" [...] and was [...] "charismatic, eloquent and <b>a</b> <b>consummate</b> master of communication, both in {{speaking}} and writing...one of the region's leading and most persistent exponents on the debilitating {{effects of the}} erosion of trade preferences for the region's banana industry on the livelihood of the people". Other tributes came from Ralph Gonsalves, the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, who described Odlum as [...] "one of the region's finest political orators, who was persuasive, eloquent {{and was able to}} command attention universally, not only in his native capital city Castries but also at the United Nations, in Geneva, Cape Town or in London".|$|E
500|$|Southey {{most likely}} learned the tale {{as a child}} from his uncle William Tyler. [...] Uncle Tyler may have told a version with a vixen (female fox) as the intruder, and then Southey may have later {{confused}} [...] "vixen" [...] with another common meaning of [...] "a crafty old woman". [...] P.M. Zall writes in [...] "The Gothic Voice of Father Bear" [...] (1974) that [...] "It was no trick for Southey, <b>a</b> <b>consummate</b> technician, to recreate the improvisational tone of an Uncle William through rhythmical reiteration, artful alliteration ('they walked into the woods, while'), even bardic interpolation ('She {{could not have been}} a good, honest Old Woman')". [...] Ultimately, it is uncertain where Southey or his uncle learned the tale.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the canon}} {{law of the}} Catholic Church, an {{annulment}} is properly called a [...] "Declaration of Nullity", because according to Catholic doctrine, the marriage of baptized persons is a sacrament and, once consummated and thereby confirmed, cannot be dissolved {{as long as the}} parties to it are alive. A [...] "Declaration of Nullity" [...] is not dissolution of a marriage, but merely the legal finding that a valid marriage was never contracted. This is analogous to a finding that a contract of sale is invalid, and hence, that the property for sale must be considered to have never been legally transferred into another's ownership. A divorce, on the other hand, is viewed as returning the property after <b>a</b> <b>consummated</b> sale.|$|R

5000|$|The {{discovery}} of impassioned but inconclusive letters written in 1875 - 1876 by James to the Russian aristocrat Paul Zhukovski, while Edel was {{deep in the}} process of finishing his biography caused an ethical crisis; his decision was to continue to ignore what he considered a peripheral aspect of the self-identified [...] "celibate" [...] and sexually diffident Jamess life. Edel did treat Jamess relationships with novelist Constance Fenimore Woolson and sculptor Hendrik Christian Andersen at length, especially in volumes three and four of the biography. After weighing all the evidence, Edel confessed that he was unable to decide whether James experienced <b>a</b> <b>consummated</b> sexual relationship. Although later scholarship and new materials have called into question the accuracy of his portrait of James,Edels work remains an important source for studies of the author.|$|R
