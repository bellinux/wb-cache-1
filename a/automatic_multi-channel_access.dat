40|$|Abstract—The co-channel {{interference}} (CCI) limits {{the capacity of}} wireless networks due to {{the limited number of}} available channels {{and the fact that the}} same channel must be reused in the system. Recently, we proposed the interference-aware channel segregation based dynamic channel assignment (IACS-DCA). Stable channel reuse pattern can be formed in a distributed manner which can minimize the CCI experienced at access points (APs) or base stations (BSs). In this paper, we introduce a <b>multi-channel</b> <b>access</b> technique for the IACS-DCA. Each AP has channel priority table, in which the channels are listed by the ascending order of average CCI power. Original IACS-DCA assumes the single channel access using the first priority channel with the lowest average CCI power. By using multiple channels at the same time in the descending priority order, more number of users can access an AP. However, the use of channels below the first orders at the same time increases the CCI and may make the channel reuse pattern unstable. We examine, by computer simulation, the channel reuse pattern and confirm that the IACS-DCA improves the signal-to-interference power ratio (SIR) even with <b>multi-channel</b> <b>access</b> compared to the conventional quasi-DCA using <b>multi-channel</b> <b>access.</b> Keywords—channel segregation; dynamic channel assignment; {{co-channel interference}}; <b>multi-channel</b> <b>access</b> I...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the {{multi-channel}} MAC protocols for underwater acoustic sensor networks. We model and analyze two generalized multi-channel MAC protocols: <b>multi-channel</b> <b>access</b> with Aloha on a dedicated control channel and <b>multi-channel</b> <b>access</b> with RTS/CTS on a dedicated control channel. Though the long delay feature of underwater acoustic channels drastically increases the complexity of the theoretical analysis of the RTS/CTS protocol, we manage to develop tight upper bound and lower bound systems for it.

40|$|Wireless {{technology}} has become ever more popular in recent years, {{which results in}} a higher and higher density of wireless devices. In order {{to cope with this}} high density, researchers are proposing the provision of multiple concurrent transmissions by dividing a broadband channel into separate narrow band subchannels. In particular, a fine-grained channel access approach calls for efficient channel allocation mechanisms, especially in distributed networks. However, most of the current <b>multi-channel</b> <b>access</b> methods rely on costly coordination, which significantly degrades network performance. Motivated by this, we propose a cross layer design, termed Attachment Learning (AT-Learning), to achieve multi-channel allocation with low cost and high efficiency in distributed OFDMA based networks. AT-Learning utilizes a jamming and cancellation technique to attach identifier signals to data traffic, without degrading the effective throughput of the original data transmission. These identifier signals help mobile stations learn the allocation strategy by themselves. After the learning stage, mobile stations can achieve a TDMA-like performance, where stations will know exactly when to transmit and on which channel without further collisions. We conduct comprehensive simulations, comparing AT-Learning with a traditional <b>multi-channel</b> <b>access</b> method like Slotted ALOHA. The experimental results demonstrate that AT-Learning can improve the throughput by up to 300 % over Slotted ALOHA...|$|R

However, these applications face many obstacles due to the complexity of managing the medium access. This shortcoming usually leads to some problems such as numerous collisions, throughput degradation and increased delays. To overcome these challenges, research works have focused on new <b>multi-channel</b> <b>access</b> methods that reduce contention as well as collision probability. Several transmissions can occur simultaneously in the same transmission area, thus considerably improving throughput and reducing delays to access the medium.

We present in this paper main <b>multi-channel</b> <b>access</b> methods generally discussed {{in the work of the}} scientific community.

Based on our results, we observe that the performance of both approaches are affected by many factors such as data rate, propagation delay and packet size. Our {{results show that the}} RTS/CTS approach is more suitable for dense networks with high date rate, whereas the random access approach is preferred in sparse networks with low data rate. Our results also demonstrate that multi-channel techniques can potentially help us combat the long delay feature of underwater acoustic channels. However, uncoordinated random channel access cannot fully exploit the advantages of the multi-channel network settings and it performs even worse than the single-channel random access protocol.
