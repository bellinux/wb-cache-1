25|$|Within the SAE G-10T subcommittee, {{there was}} some {{consideration}} <b>about</b> <b>cutting</b> back or banning laser shows. However, {{it became apparent that}} there were a large number of non-entertainment laser users as well. The focus shifted to control of known laser users, whether shows or industry/research. New policies and procedures were developed, such as the FAA 7200 Chapter 29, and Advisory Circular 70-1. Although incidents continued to occur (from January 1996 to July 1999, the FAA's Western-Pacific Region identified more than 150 incidents in which low-flying aircraft were illuminated by lasers), the situation seemed under control.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the divorce}} {{from his first}} wife in 1926, Sir James Dunn married Irene Clarice Richards, the former wife of Francis Archibald Kelhead Douglas, 11th Marquess of Queensberry. The 1928 death of his {{daughter}} Mona Dunn {{from his first marriage}} sent him into a state of depression and for a time he thought <b>about</b> <b>cutting</b> back on his business activities and returning home to his native New Brunswick. However, in 1929, his new wife gave birth to a daughter, Anne, who lifted his spirits a great deal. Anne Dunn grew up to be an artist, studying under Henry Moore and in Paris, France with Fernand Léger and at the Académie Julian. Nevertheless, Dunn and his second wife divorced in 1942 following which he married his long-time personal secretary, Marcia Anastasia Christoforides. Thirty-six years his junior, “Christofor” as she was nicknamed, was very bright, intensely loyal, and a devoted partner. James Dunn would seek her input on most every business matter {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{accession}} of Prince Faisal's elder brother, King Saud, to {{the throne}} in 1953, Prince Faisal was appointed Crown Prince. King Saud embarked on a lavish and ill-considered spending program that included {{the construction of a}} massive royal residence {{on the outskirts of the}} capital, Riyadh. He also faced pressure from neighboring Egypt, where Gamal Abdel Nasser had overthrown the monarchy in 1952. Nasser was able to cultivate a group of dissident princes led by Prince Talal, who defected to Egypt (see Free Princes). Fearing that King Saud's financial policies were bringing the state to the brink of collapse, and that his handling of foreign affairs was inept, senior members of the royal family and the ulema (religious leadership) pressured Saud into appointing Faisal to the position of prime minister in 1958, giving Faisal wide executive powers. In this new position, Faisal set <b>about</b> <b>cutting</b> spending dramatically in an effort to rescue the state treasury from bankruptcy. This policy of financial prudence was to become a hallmark of his era and earned him a reputation for thriftiness among the populace.|$|E

Smallpeice remained as managing director, and together Slattery and Smallpeice set <b>about</b> <b>cutting</b> costs at the airline as the financial performance continued to deteriorate. BOAC would incur significant losses in 1961 and 1962 amidst decreasing passenger loadings, comparatively high maintenance costs and ongoing payments to Vickers for the VC10 orders. The financial situation was further endangered by competition from independent British operation Cunard Eagle Airways, {{a joint venture}} between British Eagle and Cunard Line. The venture had ordered two Boeing 707 aircraft in March 1961, intending to recapture Cunard's transatlantic market which was traditionally the preserve of their ocean liners, the RMS Queen Mary and RMS Queen Elizabeth. They received permission to operate services between London and New York in June 1961, though this was swiftly withdrawn by the Minister of Aviation when BOAC appealed the decision.|$|E

Sulpicius affirms that Martin withdrew from the city to live in Marmoutier (Majus Monasterium), the monastery he founded, which faces Tours from the opposite shore of the Loire. Recent excavations under the abbey church have revealed the traces of a Roman posting station, beside the main Roman road along the north bank of the Loire, which seems to have been the original dwelling for the community; the 'caves' on the site are post-Roman and are probably the result of quarrying the coteau for the Romanesque abbey buildings.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 October 1920, Percy Cox {{returned}} to Baghdad {{and asked her}} to continue as Oriental Secretary, acting as liaison with the forthcoming Arab government. Gertrude Bell essentially played the role of mediator between the Arab government and British officials. Bell often had to mediate between the various groups of Iraq including a majority population of Shias in the southern region, Sunnis in central Iraq, and the Kurds, mostly in the northern region, who wished to be autonomous. Keeping these groups united was essential for political balance in Iraq and for British imperial interests. Iraq not only contained valuable resources in oil but would act as a buffer zone, with the help of Kurds in the north as a standing army in the region to protect against Turkey, Persia (Iran), and Syria. [...] British officials in London, especially Churchill, were highly concerned <b>about</b> <b>cutting</b> heavy costs in the colonies, including the cost of quashing tribal infighting.

2500|$|Simpson made an incriminating {{statement}} to police <b>about</b> <b>cutting</b> his finger {{the night of}} the murders. First {{he said that he had}} accidentally cut his finger with a shard of broken glass in his Chicago hotel room, then changed his story minutes later. He said he cut his finger in Los Angeles, then said that the cut re-opened while he was in Chicago. Later he claimed not to remember at all how he received the cut on his left middle finger. Bugliosi took Clark and Darden to task for not allowing the jury to hear the police audio tape of this statement. Bugliosi also said the prosecutors should have gone into more detail about Simpson's abuse of his wife. He said it should have been made clear to the mostly African-American jury that Simpson had little influence in the black community. Unlike some other prominent athletes, he had done nothing to help blacks less fortunate than he. Bugliosi pointed out that, although the prosecutors understood that Simpson's race had nothing to do with the murders, once the defense [...] "opened the door" [...] by trying to paint Simpson falsely as a leader in the black community who might have been framed by an overzealous prosecution looking for a suspect, the prosecution should have presented the evidence to the contrary. This might have influenced the jury's verdict. Bugliosi also criticized the prosecution's closing statements as inadequate.|$|E
2500|$|Freight trains {{operated}} by MMA were allowed (not [...] "permitted", see below) by regulators in Canada (Transport Canada) and the United States (Federal Railroad Administration) to have Single Person Train Operation (SPTO, alternately OPTO) status (1 operator). The [...] "permit" [...] process, which requires public input, was not followed. The Canadian regulator and the MMA {{entered into a}} negotiation process at the culmination of which, sometime before {{the second week of}} July 2012, the government allowed MMA to reduce their manpower to SPTO. An average of 80 tankcars per train was carried on this route under the supervision of one person only. The Maine regulator had already allowed SPTO status before the first week of April 2012. The use of SPTO for MMA freight trains was a cost-cutting move for which the railway company has received much criticism. In May 2010, former MMA engineer Jarod Briggs of Millinocket, Maine explained to the Bangor Daily News that “so much could happen in a 12-hour shift on one of these trains, such as a washed-out track, downed trees or mechanical failure. What if the engineer onboard were to encounter a medical problem? Who is going to know about it? If there is a fire engine or an ambulance needing to get by a train or a crossing when that happens, it could take hours.” Briggs left MMA to work for another railway in 2007; while he described the lone crew member involved in the Lac-Mégantic derailment as [...] "a very good engineer, one of the better on the property", he has long expressed safety concerns about the company's overall train operations because “if you have two people watching you can catch a mistake.
