40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the stability analysis of a networked control system, wherein communication from the controller to the plant input is through a digital channel subject to packet-dropouts and finite-level quantization. No <b>acknowledgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>receipt</b> are available to the controller. To alleviate the effect of packet-dropouts, the controller transmits tentative plant input sequences. Within this setup, we derive a sufficient condition for small ℓ∞ signal ℓ∞ stability of the networked control system. This condition requires the maximum number of consecutive packet-dropouts to be bounded. We also elucidate the trade-off which exists between the disturbance attenuation and the step size of the quantizer and the maximum number of consecutive packet-dropouts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We study {{a control}} {{architecture}} for linear time-invariant plants with random disturbances {{and where a}} network is placed between the controller output and the plant input. The network imposes a constraint on the expected bit-rate and is affected by random i. i. d. dropouts. Dropout-rates and <b>acknowledgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>receipt</b> are not available at the controller side. To achieve robustness with respect to i. i. d. dropouts, the controller transmits data packets containing quantized plant input predictions. These are provided by an appropriate optimal entropy coded dithered lattice vector quantizer. Within this context, we derive stochastic stability results and provide a noise-shaping model of the closed loop system. This model is employed for performance analysis by using rate-distortion theory. I...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{consider}} the control of discrete-time constrained nonlinear systems over unreliable packet-based communication networks. The random packet dropouts are modeled by a two-state Markov chain, and no <b>acknowledgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>receipt</b> are assumed. To weaken {{the impact of the}} packet dropouts, the controller transmits packets containing more than one future control input, and a suitable buffering is applied at the plant actuator side. Because the Markov chain model adopted does not ensure the number of consecutive packet dropouts to be bounded, deterministic stability cannot be guaranteed. Hence, we are interested in stochastic stability of the closed loop instead. We propose an unconstrained model predictive control scheme without additional terminal weighting term for the calculation of the control inputs. Two major advantages of this unconstrained model predictive control scheme can be emphasized. First, to guarantee stochastic stability, we do not require the knowledge of a global control Lyapunov function as terminal cost term but instead only a less restrictive controllability assumption. Second, guaranteed performance bounds on the expected infinite horizon cost of the closed loop can be obtained...|$|R

In addition, the stored message facility was replaced by a summary page, which listed all the messages, both new and old, that were waiting. The user could then pick which message to view, rather than being required to read through them all in chronological order. As only the first 20 could be accessed, this effectively allowed for up to 19 messages to be stored while allowing the continued reception of new mail.|$|E

The Act mandates school attendance for children between their sixth and sixteenth birthdays. The Act requires that an unemancipated minor older than the mandatory attendance age have the written permission of a parent or legal guardian to withdraw from school. The Act establishes that the school principal confer with the child and the parent of a legal guardian within two days of receiving notice of the intent to withdraw, to explain the lifetime consequences of not having earned a high school diploma and to provide information about earning a general education development (GED) diploma. The Act directs local school boards to adopt policies on the voluntary withdrawal of unemancipated minors older than the mandatory attendance age.

The Act mandates that schools include with the code of conduct a form on which a parent or guardian can decline permission for a child to participate in a designated club or organization formed during the school year. The Act requires that the code of conduct shall encourage parents and guardians to inform their children of the consequences of underage sexual conduct and crimes for which a minor can be tried as an adult.

40|$|Abstract. Remote {{mirroring}} {{is often}} used as part of disaster recovery solutions. Synchronous remote mirroring incurs steep costs in both write latency and network bandwidth to support the mirroring, while asyn-chronous mirroring does not ensure the consistency of remote data. In this paper, we designed and implemented a storage-based semi-synchro-nous remote mirroring system for SANs. By using a log policy for the active remote write commands, this approach allows {{a limited number of}} write I/O operations to proceed before waiting for <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>of</b> <b>receipt</b> from the remote site, which significantly reduces write latency. This implementation also provides a consistent copy in a remote site to meet the demand for disaster recovery, because the order of commands is guaranteed. Furthermore, it {{can be applied to the}} working condition of long distance mirroring with high network latency. The testing results show that with the same request size and network latency, our semi-synchronous remote mirroring reduces average write command response time by 14 - 20 % compared with synchronous remote mirroring. ...|$|E
