30|$|OCPs were intensively {{produced}} for agriculture between 1940 s and 1980 s, before restrictions and bans {{due to their}} toxic and persistent characteristics in soil and food. PCBs were intensively produced between 1930 s and 1980 s for electrical isolation, lubrication and non-flammable capacities for various electrical and mechanic applications. Their persistence in soil and food is mainly due to contaminations from plants and inadequate disposal procedures. Their distinctive status (dl or ndl) refers to their biological mode of action on hormonal receptors, the first one mimicking that of dioxins. Dioxins are non-intentionally issued from waste incineration or some industrial processes like wood and paper, metallurgy, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or pesticide synthesis. Despite progressive substitutions, BFRs are currently used for their flame retardant abilities in electronic devices as well as various furnishing materials including carpets and paintings. PFAS are commonly used as an anti-sticking material for cooking equipment, <b>anti-stain</b> <b>treatment</b> for textiles and surfactants in cleaning and cosmetic products.|$|E
