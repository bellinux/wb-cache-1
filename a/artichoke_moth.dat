50|$|A 2010 update {{suggests}} that direct plant-plant competition {{is not a}} severe problem at this time, but that climate change could encourage it. A number of insects have been noted to feed on the plant, especially favoring the developing fruits in the seed heads. Noted insects include the gall fly Paracantha gentilis, the <b>artichoke</b> plume <b>moth</b> Platyptilia carduidactyla, the bumble flower beetle Euphoria inda, and the stem borer weevil Lixus pervestitus. Large sections of several thistle populations have been damaged {{by one or more}} of these insects. The non-native flower head weevil Rhinocyllus conicus has the potential to damage the thistle; it was purposely introduced to North America in an attempt to control various species of invasive thistles which are noxious weeds, including musk thistle. The weevil was never released in New Mexico because of its potential to attack the native thistle; unfortunately, it has moved into the area on its own. So far its distribution is limited but it is expected to spread. The extent of the expected damage to the species is not known.|$|R
40|$|Hemerobius pacificus {{oviposition}} {{closely followed}} the population densities of Myzus persicae which peaked in late fall and declined {{to zero in}} spring in an untreated artichoke field. A second peak of oviposition by the predator followed the increasing populations of the <b>artichoke</b> plume <b>moth</b> (=APM), Platyptilia carduidactyla in spring. Where Hemerobius eggs were released, the aphid populations were reduced consistently, while the APM damage was reduced only at larval infestation levels of APM above 10 %. Oviposition by wild Hemerobius was lower in plots where aphids had been reduced by released predators. APM infestations were estimated to be lowered by 30 % by wild Hemerobius populations, while hymenopterous parasites accounted for 14 % of the larval mortality of APM. Protein + sugar food sprays applied 5 times during the year slightly increased Hemerobius oviposition which in turn led to lower aphid populations and slightly reduced APM infestations. Hemerobius, the only common active predator in artichokes during winter, is considered an important control agent of aphids under cool conditions, and is a mortality factor of APM larvae. Hemerobius should be preserved in integrated control program...|$|R

Premise of the study: Interactions that limit {{lifetime}} seed production {{have the potential to}} limit plant population sizes and drive adaptation through natural selection. Effects of insect herbivory to apical meristems (apical meristem mining) on lifetime seed production rarely have been quantified experimentally. We studied Cirsium altissimum (tall thistle), whose meristems are mined by Platyptilia carduidactyla (<b>artichoke</b> plume <b>moth),</b> to determine how apical damage affects plant maternal fitness and evaluate both direct and indirect mechanisms underlying these effects. Methods: In restored prairie, apical mining was manipulated on tall thistles by applying insecticide, water, or no spray to apical meristems. We quantified effects on lifetime seed production, plant architecture, and flowering phenology. Seed germinability and seedling mass were evaluated in a greenhouse. Key results: Apical meristem miners decreased lifetime seed production of C. altissimum, but not seed quality. Higher mortality rates of damaged plants contributed to reduced seed production. Apical damage reduced plant height and increased the proportion of blooming flower heads in axial positions on branches. Apical damage delayed flowering and shortened flowering duration. Conclusions: Apical meristem mining reduced plant maternal fitness. The shift in the identity of blooming flower heads from terminal to axial positions contributed to this reduction because axial heads are less fecund. Shorter, meristem-mined plants may have been more susceptible to competition, and this susceptibility may explain their higher mortality rates. The kinds of changes in architecture and phenology that resulted from apical damage to C. altissimum have been shown to affect floral visitation in other plant species...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Biological SciencesInsect {{exclusion}} {{experiments have}} demonstrated that insect herbivores can reduce host plant fitness through both direct and indirect mechanisms. I did an experiment on Cirsium altissimum (tall thistle), whose apical meristems are attacked by the larvae of Platyptilia carduidactyla (<b>artichoke</b> plume <b>moth),</b> during 2012 to determine whether apical meristem mining affects C. altissimum fitness and to determine whether these effects arise indirectly through plant-mediated effects on floral visitation. In a restored tall grass prairie, 180 tall thistle adult plants were randomly selected and assigned randomly to treat with insecticide, water and unmanipulated control. On these plants, I quantified effects of apical meristem mining on plant architecture, flowering phenology, flower visitors’ activity and seed production. Apical meristem miners affected several aspects of plant architecture, including reducing plant height and increasing the proportion of axial flower heads, and many aspects of plant flowering phenology, including delaying flowering and date of maximum floral display. Apical meristem miners significantly decreased C. altissimum lifetime seed production, showing their strong effects on plant fitness. Bombus pensylvanicus and Melissodes desponsa were the most common visitors on C. altissimum flower heads. No strong effect of apical meristem miners was reported {{on the behavior of}} bee (Apidae) species, which may have resulted from the availability of the major visitors of C. altissimum flower heads throughout the flowering season. Overall, apical meristem mining strongly affected the plant reproduction success but no evidence was found to suggest that these effects on fitness of C. altissimum arose through changes in floral visitation. Being a monocarpic plant with little seed bank, reduced seed production by C. altissimum may translate into smaller population sizes...|$|R
