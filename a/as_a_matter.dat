5|$|Coghill {{received}} his first drum {{at the age}} of 14, which was a Pearl drum kit given to him by his parents. In 1999, Coghill noted that he began using a 1970 Slingerland drum kit, citing that it had a better sound than a new kit, and was cheaper. Coghill uses Avedis Zildjian cymbals. He says that he has been offered sponsorship, but opted for older drums <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of preference. Despite this assertion, as of 2007 Coghill's name is mentioned in the Brady Drums artist roster.|$|E

5|$|Contact with {{ammunition}} is {{a source}} of lead exposure. As of 2013, lead-based ammunition production is the second largest annual use of lead in the US, accounting for over 60,000 metric tons consumed in 2012, second only to the manufacture of storage batteries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can not regulate cartridges and shells, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of law. Lead birdshot is banned in some areas, but this is primarily {{for the benefit of the}} birds and their predators, rather than humans. Non-lead alternatives include steel, tungsten-nickel-iron, bismuth-tin, and tungsten-polymer.|$|E

In 1881, for the sake of economy, and increasingly <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of principle, he became a vegetarian. He grew a beard to hide a facial scar left by smallpox. In rapid succession he wrote two more novels: The Irrational Knot (1880) and Love Among the Artists (1881), but neither found a publisher; each was serialised a few years later in the socialist magazine Our Corner.|$|E

50|$|Replying to Arnauld, in 1654, 38 French bishops {{condemned}} Arnauld's {{position to}} the pope. Opponents of Jansenism {{in the church}} refused absolution to Roger du Plessis, duc de Liancourt (fr) for his continued protection of the Jansenists. In response to this onslaught, Arnauld articulated <b>a</b> distinction <b>as</b> to how far the Church could bind {{the mind of a}} Catholic. He argued that there is a distinction between de jure and de facto: that a Catholic was obliged to accept the Church's opinion <b>as</b> to <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of law (i.e., <b>as</b> to <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of doctrine) but not <b>as</b> to <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of fact.

The introduction of rifled breech-loading guns, capable of firing explosive shells, and the construction of armour-plated warships left Hurst's guns and fortifications inadequate.
