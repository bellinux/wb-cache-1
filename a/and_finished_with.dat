40|$|Aim: The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine the influence of chemical-cure adhesives and light-cure adhesives on the stain susceptibility after debonding and the effects of different clean-up procedures on the stain susceptibility after debonding. Materials and methods: Seventy teeth specimens were randomly divided into seven groups of 10 teeth-Group 1 : no bonding (control group), Group 2 : bonding with light-cure adhesive, i. e. transbond XT <b>and</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>with</b> carbide bur after debonding, Group 3 : bonding <b>with</b> transbond XT <b>and</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>with</b> carbide bur <b>and</b> polishing with pumice and rubber cup after debonding, Group 4 : bonding <b>with</b> transbond XT <b>and</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>with</b> Sof-Lex disks after debonding, Group 5 : bonding with chemical-cure adhesive, i. e. unite <b>and</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>with</b> carbide bur after debonding, Group 6 : bonding <b>with</b> unite <b>and</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>with</b> carbide bur <b>and</b> polishing with pumice and rubber cup after debonding, Group 7 : bonding with unite and followed by debonding <b>and</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>with</b> Sof-Lex disks after debonding. The color parameters were measured on spectrophotometer before bonding and after methylene blue staining following debonding and clean-up procedures. Results: Comparing each clean-up procedure in both adhesive systems, color change for Group 6 (19. 59) was significantly higher than Group 3 (15. 00) (p 0. 05). Conclusion: Chemical-cure adhesive showed higher stain susceptibility than light-cure adhesive in all clean-up procedures. Both adhesives would show less stain susceptibility with polishing step with rubber cup and pumice...|$|R
