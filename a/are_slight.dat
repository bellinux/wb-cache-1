5|$|The Florida {{peninsula}} appeared {{above sea}} level between 100,000 and 150,000years ago. As sea levels rose {{at the end of}} the Wisconsin ice age, the water table appeared closer to land. Lake Okeechobee began to flood and convection thunderstorms were created. Vast peat deposits south of Lake Okeechobee indicate that regular flooding had occurred about 5,000 years ago. Plants began to migrate, subtropical ones from the northern part of Florida, and tropicals carried as seeds by birds from islands in the Caribbean. The limestone shelf appears to be flat, but there <b>are</b> <b>slight</b> rises—called pinnacles—and depressions caused by the erosion of limestone by the acidic properties of the water. The amount of time throughout the year that water is present in a location in the Everglades determines the type of soil, of which there only two in the Everglades: peat, created by many years of decomposing plant matter, and marl, the result of dried periphyton, or chunks of algae and microorganisms that create a grayish mud. Portions of the Everglades that remain flooded for more than nine months out of the year are usually covered by peat. Areas that are flooded six months or less are covered by marl. Plant communities are determined by the type of soil and amount of water present.|$|E

Each hob tooth is relieved on the back side to reduce friction.|$|E
25|$|PUTs is {{calculated}} {{by considering the}} average audience figures gauged from the peopleometer, for all channels during a particular time period and adding them together to get the cumulative number. Put {{is used to calculate}} the demographic persons rating. Almost all media scales are technically based on person’s ratings. It is observed that the percentage rating remains constant from year to year. If changes are observed, then they <b>are</b> <b>slight</b> in nature and only due to changes in viewing habits.|$|E
25|$|The fox {{appears in}} many cultures, usually in folklore. However, there <b>are</b> <b>slight</b> {{variations}} in their depictions in folklore. In Western folklore {{and also in}} Persian folklore, foxes are depicted {{as a symbol of}} cunning and trickery – a reputation derived especially from their reputed ability to evade hunters. This is usually represented as a character possessing these traits. These traits are used {{on a wide variety of}} characters, either making them a nuisance to the story, a misunderstood hero, or a devious villain.|$|E

25|$|The {{black-footed ferret}} {{is roughly the}} size of a mink, and differs from the European polecat by the greater {{contrast}} between its dark limbs and pale body and the shorter length of its black tail-tip. In contrast, differences between the black-footed ferret and the steppe polecat of Asia <b>are</b> <b>slight,</b> {{to the point where the}} two species were once thought to be conspecific. The only noticeable differences between the black-footed ferret and the steppe polecat are the former's much shorter and coarser fur, larger ears, and longer postmolar extension of the palate.|$|E
25|$|As {{a member}} of the Corps, a cadet climbs through four classes of seniority. The current Corps of Cadets uniform is unique among {{military}} schools, bearing a close resemblance to the US Army uniforms from after World War I to World War II. There <b>are</b> <b>slight</b> differences in the uniform worn by each class year, noted below, including the Senior Boots, calf-skin riding boots harkening back to the US Army officer's uniform of World War I. All cadets wear the same basic Corps uniform regardless of service affiliation.|$|E

On the levelled summit area <b>are</b> <b>slight</b> indications of rubble walling and artificial scarping on {{the south and east}} sides and in the north-east corner are the possible remains of a hut circle.|$|E

25|$|Kolkali is an {{art form}} {{involving}} {{both men and women}} and is unique to the area. It is the only folk art that is performed by both Hindus and Muslims, although there <b>are</b> <b>slight</b> differences in how the two do it. Muslims perform it as a form of entertainment during social gatherings and marriages, whereas the Hindus perform it at temple festivals. It involves rapid limb movements and simultaneous chanting of folksong, with the performers moving in pairs, hitting their batons (koles) against each other in a methodical way in tune with folksongs. It is played according to Vaithari or Thalam by the Gurukkal (Teacher).|$|E
25|$|Anatomical {{differences}} between the common chimpanzee and the bonobo <b>are</b> <b>slight.</b> Both are omnivorous adapted to a mainly frugivorous diet. Yet sexual and social behaviours are markedly different. The common chimpanzee has a troop culture based on beta males led by an alpha male, and highly complex social relationships. The bonobo, on the other hand, has egalitarian, nonviolent, matriarchal, sexually receptive behaviour. Bonobos frequently have sex, sometimes to help prevent and resolve conflicts. Different groups of chimpanzees also have different cultural behaviour with preferences for types of tools. The common chimpanzee tends to display greater aggression than does the bonobo. The average captive chimpanzee sleeps 9 hours and 42 minutes per day.|$|E
25|$|The terms “Varangian” and “Rus” can {{sometimes}} be used interchangeably but there <b>are</b> <b>slight</b> {{differences between the two}} groups. Both refer to the peoples of Scandinavian descent who settled in the Dnieper-Volga region during and after the 8th century. The Varangians are a more clearly definable group. They were Scandinavians in Eastern Europe who were often associated with Byzantium and the Byzantine emperor’s Varangian Guard. These mercenaries were almost entirely men who either returned to their Scandinavian homeland or married into the local Slavic culture. The term “Rus” is more difficult to define. The Rus were more inclined to settle in towns with their families. The term “Rus” is sometimes used in primary sources to describe Slavic peoples as well as Scandinavians. Its definition becomes clearer later in the period when it developed from the name of a people to the name of a political entity and area of land.|$|E
