5|$|Approximately once a decade, <b>a</b> <b>comet</b> becomes {{bright enough}} to be noticed by a casual observer, leading such comets to be {{designated}} as great comets. Predicting whether <b>a</b> <b>comet</b> will become a great comet is notoriously difficult, as many factors may cause a comet's brightness to depart drastically from predictions. Broadly speaking, if <b>a</b> <b>comet</b> has a large and active nucleus, will pass close to the Sun, and is not obscured by the Sun {{as seen from the}} Earth when at its brightest, it has a chance of becoming a great comet. However, Comet Kohoutek in 1973 fulfilled all the criteria and was expected to become spectacular but failed to do so. Comet West, which appeared three years later, had much lower expectations but became an extremely impressive comet.|$|E
5|$|Centaurs {{typically}} behave with {{characteristics of}} both asteroids and comets. Centaurs {{can be classified}} as comets such as 60558 Echeclus, and 166P/NEAT. 166P/NEAT was discovered while it exhibited a coma, and so is classified as <b>a</b> <b>comet</b> despite its orbit, and 60558 Echeclus was discovered without a coma but later became active, and was then classified as both <b>a</b> <b>comet</b> and an asteroid (174P/Echeclus). One plan for Cassini involved sending it to a centaur, but NASA decided to destroy it instead.|$|E
5|$|Comet 1X: Two RCAF Comet 1As were rebuilt with heavier-gauge skins to <b>a</b> <b>Comet</b> 2 {{standard}} for the fuselage, and renamed Comet 1X.|$|E
50|$|For Tebbutt's Comet of 1881, Henry Draper {{took the}} first {{wide-angle}} photograph of <b>a</b> <b>comet's</b> tail and the first spectrum of <b>a</b> <b>comet's</b> head. Andrew Common used his Newtonian reflecting telescope with 36-inch mirror to photograph the comet.|$|R
25|$|The {{brilliance}} of comet tails comes largely from water vapor. On {{approach to the}} Sun, the ice many comets carry sublimates to vapor, which reflects light from the Sun. Knowing <b>a</b> <b>comet's</b> distance from the sun, astronomers may deduce <b>a</b> <b>comet's</b> water content from its brilliance.|$|R

5|$|Halley {{may have}} been {{recorded}} as early as 467BC, but this is uncertain. <b>A</b> <b>comet</b> was recorded in ancient Greece between 468 and 466 BC; its timing, location, duration, and associated meteor shower all suggest it was Halley. According to Pliny the Elder, that same year a meteorite fell {{in the town of}} Aegospotami, in Thrace. He described it as brown in colour and the size of a wagon load. Chinese chroniclers also mention <b>a</b> <b>comet</b> in that year.|$|E
5|$|The mission coincidentally shared {{its name}} with the 1998 film, Deep Impact, in which <b>a</b> <b>comet</b> strikes the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the coma}} and tail are {{illuminated}} by the Sun and may become visible when <b>a</b> <b>comet</b> passes through the inner Solar System, the dust reflects Sunlight directly while the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible {{without the aid of}} a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Occasionally <b>a</b> <b>comet</b> may experience a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of the coma greatly increases for a period of time. This happened in 2007 to Comet Holmes.|$|E
5000|$|... 129P/Shoemaker-Levy, {{also known}} as Shoemaker-Levy 3, is <b>a</b> {{periodic}} <b>comet</b> in the Solar System. It fits the definition of <b>an</b> Encke-type <b>comet</b> with (TJupiter > 3; a < aJupiter), and is <b>a</b> quasi-Hilda <b>comet.</b>|$|R

5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp (formally {{designated}} C/1995O1) is <b>a</b> <b>comet</b> {{that was}} perhaps the most widely observed of the 20th century, and one of the brightest seen for many decades.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, the {{astronomer}} Giuseppe Piazzi discovered an object which he initially {{believed to be}} <b>a</b> <b>comet.</b> Shortly thereafter he announced his observations of this object, noting that the slow, uniform motion was uncharacteristic of <b>a</b> <b>comet,</b> suggesting {{it was a different}} type of object. This was lost from sight for several months, but was recovered later that year by the Baron von Zach and Heinrich W. M. Olbers after a preliminary orbit was computed by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This object came to be named Ceres, and was the first asteroid to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{convention}} of naming comets after their discoverers became common, and this remains so today. <b>A</b> <b>comet</b> can be named after its discoverers, or an instrument or program {{that helped to}} find it.|$|E

5000|$|... 1996 PW was {{discovered}} on 1996 August 9 by a NEAT automated search camera on Haleakalā, Hawaii. It {{was the first}} object that was not <b>an</b> active <b>comet</b> discovered on <b>an</b> orbit typical of <b>a</b> long-period <b>comets.</b> This is raised the possibility it was <b>an</b> extinct <b>comet</b> or <b>a</b> usual asteroid.|$|R
5000|$|... 238P/Read (P/2005 U1) is <b>a</b> main-belt <b>comet</b> {{discovered}} on 2005 October 24 by M. T. Read using the Spacewatch 36 inch telescope on Kitt Peak. It has an orbit within {{the asteroid belt}} and has displayed the coma of <b>a</b> traditional <b>comet.</b> It fits the definition of <b>an</b> Encke-type <b>comet</b> with (TJupiter > 3; a < aJupiter).|$|R
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's {{existence}} the orbits of comets are unstable and eventually dynamics dictate that <b>a</b> <b>comet</b> must either collide with the Sun or a planet or else be ejected from the Solar System by planetary perturbations.|$|E
5|$|Research {{published}} in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in June 2009 suggests that noctilucent clouds observed following the Tunguska Event of 1908 are evidence that the impact was caused by <b>a</b> <b>comet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since retirement, three early-generation Comet {{airframes}} {{have survived}} in museum collections. The only complete remaining Comet 1, <b>a</b> <b>Comet</b> 1XB with the registration G-APAS, is {{displayed at the}} RAF Museum Cosford. While painted in BOAC colours, it never flew for the airline, having been first delivered to Air France {{and then to the}} Ministry of Supply after conversion to 1XB standard; this aircraft also served with the RAF as XM823. The sole surviving Comet fuselage with the original square-shaped windows, part of <b>a</b> <b>Comet</b> 1A registered F-BGNX, has undergone restoration and is on display at the de Havilland Aircraft Museum in Hertfordshire, England. <b>A</b> <b>Comet</b> C2 Sagittarius with serial XK699, later maintenance serial 7971M, has been on display at the gate of RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire, England since 1987. In 2012, with the planned closure of RAF Lyneham, the aircraft was slated to be dismantled and shipped to the RAF Museum Cosford where it will be re-assembled for display.|$|E
5000|$|H. G. Wells' In the Days of the <b>Comet</b> (1905) is <b>an</b> {{account of}} how the vapours of <b>a</b> <b>comet's</b> tail cause <b>an</b> {{instantaneous}} worldwide utopian society.|$|R
2500|$|One {{way that}} Gregory {{reduced the number}} of unexplained UFOs was by simple reclassification. [...] "Possible cases" [...] became [...] "probable", and [...] "probable" [...] cases were {{upgraded}} to certainties. By this logic, <b>a</b> possible <b>comet</b> became <b>a</b> probable <b>comet,</b> while <b>a</b> probable <b>comet</b> was flatly declared to have been <b>a</b> misidentified <b>comet.</b> Similarly, if <b>a</b> witness reported an observation of an unusual balloon-like object, Blue Book usually classified it as a balloon, with no research and qualification. These procedures became standard for most of Blue Book's later investigations; see Hynek's comments below.|$|R
40|$|Before <b>a</b> {{particular}} <b>comet</b> {{is selected}} as a flyby target, {{the following criteria}} {{should be considered in}} determining its ephemeris uncertainty: (1) <b>A</b> target <b>comet</b> should have good observability during the apparition of the proposed intercept; and (2) <b>A</b> target <b>comet</b> should have <b>a</b> good observational history. Several well observed and consecutive apparitions allow an accurate determination of <b>a</b> <b>comet's</b> mean motion and nongravitational parameters. Using these criteria, along with statistical and empirical error analyses, it has been demonstrated that the 1980 apparition of <b>comet</b> Encke is <b>an</b> excellent opportunity for a cometary flyby space probe. For this particular apparition, a flyby to within 1, 000 km of comet Encke seems possible without the use of sophisticated and expensive onboard navigation instrumentation...|$|R
5|$|The {{story of}} the film focused on four astronauts that were bombarded with cosmic rays from <b>a</b> <b>comet</b> while on an {{experimental}} space craft. In the process, they acquired extraordinary abilities.|$|E
5|$|Thus, Oort reasoned, <b>a</b> <b>comet</b> {{could not}} have formed while in its current orbit and must have been held in an outer {{reservoir}} for almost all of its existence.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>comet</b> is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing {{close to}} the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process called outgassing. This {{produces}} a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due {{to the effects of}} solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, <b>a</b> <b>comet</b> may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.|$|E
5000|$|... 116P/Wild, {{also known}} as Wild 4, is <b>a</b> {{periodic}} <b>comet</b> in the Solar System. It fits the definition of <b>an</b> Encke-type <b>comet</b> with (TJupiter > 3; a < aJupiter).|$|R
5000|$|... 13P/Olbers is <b>a</b> {{periodic}} <b>comet</b> with <b>an</b> {{orbital period}} of 69 years. It fits the classical definition of <b>a</b> Halley-type <b>comet</b> with (20 years < period < 200 years).|$|R
5000|$|... 165P/LINEAR is <b>a</b> {{periodic}} <b>comet</b> in {{the solar}} system. 165P/LINEAR has a perihelion distance of 6.8 AU, and is <b>a</b> Chiron-type <b>comet</b> with (TJupiter > 3; a > aJupiter).|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>comet</b> may be {{discovered}} photographically using a wide-field telescope or visually with binoculars. However, even {{without access to}} optical equipment, {{it is still possible}} for the amateur astronomer to discover a sungrazing comet online by downloading images accumulated by some satellite observatories such as SOHO. SOHO's 2000th comet was discovered by Polish amateur astronomer Michał Kusiak on 26 December 2010 and both discoverers of Hale-Bopp used amateur equipment (although Hale was not an amateur).|$|E
5|$|A sungrazing comet is <b>a</b> <b>comet</b> {{that passes}} {{extremely}} {{close to the}} Sun at perihelion, generally within a few million kilometres. Although small sungrazers can be completely evaporated during such a close approach to the Sun, larger sungrazers can survive many perihelion passages. However, the strong tidal forces they experience often lead to their fragmentation.|$|E
5|$|All {{production}} Comet 2s {{were also}} modified {{to alleviate the}} fatigue problems (most of these served with the RAF as the Comet C2), while a programme to produce <b>a</b> <b>Comet</b> 2 with more powerful Avons was delayed. The prototype Comet 3 first flew in July 1954, and was tested in an unpressurised state pending completion of the Cohen inquiry. Comet commercial flights would not resume until 1958.|$|E
50|$|C/1769 P1 (Messier) is <b>a</b> long-period <b>comet</b> {{that was}} {{visible to the}} naked eye at its last {{apparition}} in 1769. Because of its outstanding brightness it is called <b>a</b> great <b>comet.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1960 he {{discovered}} Comet Candy 1960n {{and was the}} first Astronomer to discover, as well as compute, <b>a</b> <b>comets</b> orbit from two more observations within 60 hours of its discovery.|$|R
5000|$|... 167P/CINEOS is <b>a</b> {{periodic}} <b>comet</b> in {{the solar}} system. It is <b>a</b> Chiron-type <b>comet</b> with (TJupiter > 3; a > aJupiter). It will pass 1.64 AU from Uranus in June 2039.|$|R
