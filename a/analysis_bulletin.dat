40|$|Information and {{communication}} technologies (ICTs) are often portrayed as offering a collaborative community {{space in which}} native and non-native language speakers reciprocally scaffold linguistic, cultural and content knowledge, a space which assists students in overcoming well-documented challenges encountered in traditional classrooms (Leki, 2001; Morita, 2000, 2004). However, recent studies point to the communicative disjunctures arising from variances in cultural capital and socio-technological histories in on-line dialogic encounters between student groups (see Belz, 2003; Kramsch & Thorne, 2002; Thorne, 2003, 2000). This article examines on-line community formation among participants in a graduate seminar on modern language education and the pedagogical design that facilitated the development of norms of joint construction of knowledge, reciprocity, and sharing.

40|$|Abstract: A {{monograph}} {{regarding the}} history of Canada’s intelligence gathering apparatus has not been published, leaving a gap in modern historiography. In an attempt to partially fill this academic void, this essay examines RCMP intelligence Bulletins drafted during World War Two that have been declassified under the Access to Information Act. <b>Analysis</b> of the <b>Bulletins</b> clearly indicates the Canadian intelligence gathering apparatus underwent a massive expansion of scope during the war. The RCMP began investigating people and organizations based upon their race, religion, political affiliation or nationalist beliefs. Disregard {{of human rights and}} privacy during the period was so widespread, even the police remarked upon the depth of their new powers inside the Bulletins. Some people, such as the future Prime Minister Diefenbaker, worked to enshrine human rights in the Canadian constitution thereafter, attempting to prevent the police from acquiring such powers ever again. Due to parallel tactics used during World War Two and the modern day, an effective Supreme Court challenge could be mounted against tactics used in Canada’s war on terror based upon historical and constitutional grounds...|$|R

40|$|In the United States, {{the flood}} {{frequency}} analysis guidelines described in Bulletin 17 B are followed to provide reliable flood discharge magnitude estimates for urban floodplain planning and flood insurance studies. The statistical <b>analysis</b> in <b>Bulletin</b> 17 B has various assumptions, including that floods are {{generated by the}} same type of atmospheric mechanism (flood homogeneity). However, these assumptions should be carefully assessed before proceeding since they might not always be valid and could increase the potential for flood risk. This study focuses on flood frequency analysis from the perspective of flood heterogeneity, the hydrometeorological genesis of each flood event, in Arizona. This was done by analyzing the occurrence and magnitude of individual flood events, which were classified by their flood-producing atmospheric mechanism. Flood frequency curves were derived for each mechanism and combined using a new approach involving the Partial Duration Series peaks. The combined frequency curves were then compared to curves derived from the standard Bulletin 17 B method. Results showed that in southern Arizona, the dominant flooding mechanism is characterized by brief, intense, and localized convective precipitation in the summer. However, the dominant flood-producing mechanism in the central Arizona topographic transition zone and at higher elevations is characterized by prolonged and widespread precipitation from synoptic activity in the winter. Tropical cyclone-enhanced precipitation is also an important, but infrequent, flood-producing mechanism throughout the state. Overall, the dominant mechanism does not necessarily produce the largest floods. In such cases flood heterogeneity can have a strong influence on the discharge estimates for the most extreme upper tail probabilities calculated from the flood frequency analysis. Thus, the most frequent floods may impose very little risk of flooding while uncommon floods can impose a much larger one. These results suggest that the flood homogeneity assumption is not valid in many Arizona watersheds. To produce the most accurate discharge estimates possible, it is critical that both analysts and flood managers become aware of the potential repercussions if these details are overlooked...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} rites that members and churches of the Connecticut Conference of the United Church of Christ perform when {{a member of}} the community dies. A distinction between a “funeral” and “memorial service” is established, with a funeral defined as a rite provided by the Church at the death of a Christian that is both a rite of passage for the dead and a service of the worship of God for the living, and a memorial service identified as a communal gathering that focuses more on eulogizing and remembering the deceased and less on the overt worship of God. By examining the difference between the two, and by looking at historic liturgical sources, it is clear that in the Connecticut Conference at this time, most rites are memorial services rather than funerals. Assessment was made by means of a qualitative <b>analysis</b> of worship <b>bulletins</b> for rites at the time of death that were submitted by seventy-two of the Connecticut Conference churches, in which worship patterns, hymns and scriptures were identified in order to construct a “moment-in-time” snapshot of commonalities among churches in a tradition that cherishes individual expression and resists standard liturgies imposed from the denomination. In conclusion, a new set of death rites based on the findings of the research is offered...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{sheds light}} on {{the ways in which}} audiences are made through the {{relationships}} between organisational policy and news production practice. It explores the relationships between news practitioners' perceptions and definitions of audiences, production, and organisational policies, using the radio news service of the Australian national public broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). In so doing, the thesis demonstrates that production, in its institutional context, is a crucial site for the creation of audiences in the study of news journalism. In the process, it illuminates the role of public service broadcasting, in a world of digital media The conceptual framework utilises a new approach to framing analysis. Framing has been used to examine the news "agenda" and to identify the salient aspects of news events. This thesis demonstrates ways in which framing can be used to research important processes in news production at different levels, from policy level to that of professional culture, and generate insights to the relationship between them. The accumulated evidence of the <b>bulletin</b> <b>analysis</b> - using structural and rhetorical frames of news - field observation and interviews, shows that a specific and coherent audience can be constructed as a result of newsroom work practices in combination with organisational policies. The thesis has increased knowledge and understanding both of how news workers create images of their audiences and what the institutional factors are that influence the manufacture of audiences as they appear in the text of news bulletins...|$|R
