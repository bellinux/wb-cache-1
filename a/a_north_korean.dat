5|$|During {{the day on}} June 29, the KPAF {{returned}} to attack Suwon, and six sorties of North Korean aircraft strafed the airfield during the morning, but each time were driven off by American F-80s, {{and in the course}} of these attacks Lieutenant William T. Norris and Lieutenant Roy W. Marsh each shot down <b>a</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> aircraft. The North Koreans were able to destroy a single C-54 Skymaster parked at the airfield. The sorties culminated in a battle above Suwon in the midst of a conference of US military leaders in the town. Leaders including US Lieutenant General George E. Stratemeyer and General of the Army Douglas MacArthur personally witnessed the final sortie of the day, in which four North Korean aircraft attacked four F-51 Mustang aircraft over the town. The four F-51s succeeded in shooting down all four of the North Korean aircraft, with Lieutenant Orrin R. Fox scoring two kills and Lieutenants Richard J. Burns, and Harry T. Sandlin scoring one each. Ground forces also downed <b>a</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> aircraft during a subsequent attack. MacArthur subsequently authorized Stratemeyer to launch strikes into North Korea to destroy North Korean airfields and establish air superiority for the US forces.|$|E

5|$|The 3rd Battalion, 24th Infantry {{relieved}} the 1st Battalion in the Battle Mountain area on August 27, and 1st Battalion withdrew to reserve, {{except for}} C Company which remained on Battle Mountain {{as a part}} of Task Force Baker. The next day, August 28, North Korean attacks continued. That day, <b>a</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> company-sized attack struck between C and I Companies before dawn. That night, North Korean mortar fire fell on C Company on Battle Mountain. After midnight, <b>a</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> infantry force appeared in the rear area and captured the command post. Some men of C Company left their positions on Battle Mountain without firing when the attack began at 02:45 the next morning, August 29. The North Koreans then directed their attack toward E Company and overran part of its positions. Airdrops after daylight kept C Company supplied with ammunition, and a curtain of artillery fire, sealing off approaches from the North Koreans' main positions prevented substantial reinforcements from entering the fight. All day on August 29, artillery fire and air strikes racked the North Koreans occupying E Company's old positions. Then, in the evening, E Company counterattacked and reoccupied the lost ground.|$|E
5|$|The American counteroffensive of 3–5 September west of Yongsan {{resulted}} {{in one of}} the bloodiest and most terrifying debacles of the war for <b>a</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> division, according to historians.
