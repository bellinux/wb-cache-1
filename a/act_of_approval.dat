This was at the commencement of his reign; but the accident to the queen's stand had so angered him that he had not again been present at the sports, and his reappearance now was considered to be an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> of the efforts which the city had made to aid him in the war, and as an introduction of the young prince to the citizens.|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} of the ways of expressing the speech <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> in Polish, Russian and English. The material has been gathered from corpora, and only the examples have been taken into consideration where the phrase uttered by a speaker is introduced in the narration part as approval. This method of collecting material gives the opportunity to avoid misunderstanding in the process of the interpretation of the speaker’s intentions. It occurs that approval introduced in the narrative part of a text is more often nonverbal in Polish and English materials. The lexical markers of the speech act under investigation display a considerable number of similarities between Polish, Russian and English examples. The utterances are usually stylistically neutral and they are generally simple in structure.

25|$|He {{introduced}} legislation {{to establish a}} Department of Peace in 1946 {{with the goal of}} strengthening America's capacity to resolve and manage international conflicts by both military and nonmilitary means. In the 1970s and 1980s he joined Senators Mark Hatfield and Spark Matsunaga and Congressman Dan Glickman in efforts to create a national institution dedicated to peace. After he had announced his retirement from Congress in 1984, Randolph {{played a key role in}} the passage and enactment of the United States Institute <b>of</b> Peace <b>Act.</b> To guarantee its passage and funding, the legislation was attached to the Department <b>of</b> Defense Authorization <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> 1985. <b>Approval</b> <b>of</b> the legislation was in part a tribute to Randolph's long career in public service. The Jennings Randolph Program, which awards fellowships to enable outstanding scholars, policymakers, journalists, and other professionals from around the world to conduct research at the U.S. Institute of Peace, has been named in his honor.|$|R
50|$|The Newmarket Railway then {{intended}} building extensions {{through to}} Bury St Edmunds, Ely and Thetford and a parliamentary <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> 1847 gave <b>approval</b> for this. The Eastern Counties Railway (ECR), {{who ran the}} competing (and longer) route via Cambridge, Ely and Thetford, opposed this fearing a loss of Norwich traffic to this more direct route. The ECR also operated the London Liverpool Street to Cambridge route at this time and were {{in a position to}} make things difficult for the Newmarket Railway which ceased operations in June 1850.|$|R
50|$|As of January 2011, IVI {{includes}} 40 {{countries and}} the World Health Organization (WHO) as signatories to its Establishment Agreement. To be more specific, there are 33 signatory countries, which are the states that express their consent to be bound by a treaty by signing the treaty {{without the need for}} ratification, acceptance <b>of</b> <b>approval.</b> These states may definitively sign a treaty only when the treaty so permits. In addition, there are 16 parties which involve Liberia, Republic of Korea, Brazil, Mongolia, China, Sri Lanka, Ecuador, Sweden, Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Peru, Philippines, and the World Health Organization (WHO). A major difference between a signatory and a party is that a party to a treaty is a state or other entity with treaty-making capacity that has expressed its consent to be bound by that treaty by an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> ratification, acceptance, <b>approval</b> or accession etc. where that treaty has entered into force for that particular State.|$|R

In the interest of consistent, fair, and logical results, the court will ultimately need to retreat from the very technical interpretation of primary ultra vires that it applied in Chemical Bank.

25|$|The new {{president}} thought it advantageous to quickly pursue one of Kennedy's primary legislative goals—a tax cut. Johnson {{worked closely with}} Harry F. Byrd of Virginia to negotiate {{a reduction in the}} budget below $100 billion in exchange for what became overwhelming Senate <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> the Revenue <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> 1964. Congressional <b>approval</b> followed at the end of February, and facilitated efforts to follow on civil rights. In late 1963 Johnson also launched the initial offensive of his War on Poverty, recruiting Kennedy relative Sargent Shriver, then head of the Peace Corps, to spearhead the effort. In March 1964, LBJ sent to Congress the Economic Opportunity Act, which created the Job Corps and the Community Action Program, designed to attack poverty locally. The act also created VISTA, Volunteers in Service to America, a domestic counterpart to the Peace Corps.|$|R

50|$|A quasi-constitutional law may be {{repealed}} or {{amended by}} means <b>of</b> an ordinary <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> the parliament or legislature, {{just like any}} other law.

50|$|Petitioners, two Texas {{over-the-counter}} broker-dealers in securities, {{who were}} not members of the New York Stock Exchange, arranged {{with members of the}} Exchange in New York City for direct-wire telephone connections which were essential to the conduct of their businesses. The members applied to the Exchange, as required by its rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> 1934, for <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> the connections. Temporary approval was granted and the connections were established; but, without prior notice to petitioners, the applications were denied later, and the connections were discontinued, as required by rules of the Exchange. Allegedly as a result, one of the petitioners was forced out of business and the other's business was greatly diminished. Notwithstanding repeated requests, officials of the Exchange refused to grant petitioners a hearing or even to inform them of the reasons for denial of the applications. Petitioners sued the Exchange and its members in a Federal District Court for treble damages and injunctive relief, claiming that their collective refusal to continue the direct-wire connections violated the Sherman Act.|$|R
30|$|All {{experiments}} were performed {{in accordance with}} the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> 1986 and <b>approval</b> from the University College London Ethics Committee. All animals were housed under standard conditions with water and chow diet ad libitum. Operative procedures and echocardiography were performed under general anaesthesia while the animals were breathing spontaneously through a facemask entrained with a mixture of room air and isoflurane. Animals were externally warmed during anaesthesia to maintain body temperature between 36 °C and 38 °C. In mice, the depth of anaesthesia was titrated at each time point using the loss of reflex withdrawal to pain as the end point to minimize the cardiovascular effects of isoflurane. In rats, a fixed percentage (2.5 % during surgical procedures and 1.5 % for induction of sepsis and echocardiography) of isoflurane was used throughout. Room temperature was maintained at a constant 21 °C.|$|R
