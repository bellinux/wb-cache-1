5|$|In early 1922, the world's major navies, {{including}} Italy, {{signed the}} Washington Naval Treaty. According {{to the terms}} of the treaty, Italy could keep Napoli and her three sisters, along with the newer dreadnought battleships. Due to the small size <b>and</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> the ships, particularly in comparison to the modern dreadnoughts, the Italians could have kept the ships in service indefinitely. They could not, however, be replaced by new battleships under the normal practice of the Treaty system, which provided for replacements after a ship was 20 years old. Napoli was retained for a few years, but was stricken from the naval register on 3 August 1926 and sold for scrap.|$|E

5|$|The finest {{rooms were}} {{decorated}} by Pietro da Cortona {{in the high}} baroque style. Initially Cortona frescoed a small room on the piano nobile called the Sala della Stufa with a series depicting the Four Ages of Man which were very well received; the Age of Gold <b>and</b> <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Silver were painted in 1637, followed in 1641 by the Age of Bronze <b>and</b> <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Iron. They are regarded among his masterpieces. The artist was subsequently asked to fresco the grand ducal reception rooms; a suite of five rooms {{at the front of}} the palazzo. In these five Planetary Rooms, the hierarchical sequence of the deities is based on Ptolomeic cosmology; Venus, Apollo, Mars, Jupiter (the Medici Throne room) and Saturn, but minus Mercury and the Moon which should have come before Venus. These highly ornate ceilings with frescoes and elaborate stucco work essentially celebrate the Medici lineage and the bestowal of virtuous leadership. Cortona left Florence in 1647, and his pupil and collaborator, Ciro Ferri, completed the cycle by the 1660s. They were to inspire the later Planet Rooms at Louis XIV's Versailles, designed by Le Brun.|$|E
5|$|The origin <b>and</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> {{the figure}} are unclear. It is {{often thought of}} as an ancient construction, though the {{earliest}} mention of it dates to the late 17th century. Early antiquarians associated it, on little evidence, with a Saxon deity, while other scholars sought to identify it with a Celtic British figure of the Greek Hercules or some syncretization of the two. Archaeological evidence that parts of the drawing have been lost over time strengthen the Hercules identification. The lack of earlier descriptions leads some modern scholars to conclude that it probably dates from the 17th century, and perhaps originated as political satire.|$|E

5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{is considered}} an apex predator throughout its range. They are opportunists and their diet is determined largely by both the size <b>and</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> the American alligator and the size and availability of prey. Most American alligators will eat {{a wide variety of}} animals, including invertebrates, fish, birds, turtles, snakes, amphibians, and mammals. Hatchlings mostly feed on invertebrates such as insects, insect larvae, snails, spiders, and worms. As they grow, American alligators gradually expand to larger prey. Once an American alligator reaches adulthood, any animal living in the water or coming to the water to drink is potential prey, due to the size and power of the American alligator. However, most animals captured by American alligators are considerably smaller than the American alligator itself. Stomach contents show, among native mammals, muskrats and raccoons {{are some of the most}} commonly eaten species. In Louisiana, where introduced coypu are common, they are perhaps the most regular prey for adult American alligators, although only larger adult American alligators commonly eat this species. Other animals may occasionally be eaten, even large deer or feral wild boars, but these are not normally part of the diet. Occasionally, domestic animals, including dogs, cats, and calves, are taken as available, but are secondary to wild and feral prey. Other prey, including snakes, lizards, and various invertebrates, are eaten occasionally by adults. Water birds, such as herons and egrets, storks, waterfowl and large dabbling rails such as gallinules or coots, are taken when possible. Occasionally, unwary adult birds are grabbed and eaten by American alligators, but most predation on bird species occur with unsteady fledgling birds in late summer as the prey of American alligators, as fledgling birds attempt to make their first flights near the water's edge.|$|E
5|$|There were {{formerly}} up {{to seven}} species described, including C. casuarius, C. bicristatus Parks 1935, C. brevicristatus Parks 1935, C. excavatus Gilmore 1923, C. frontalis Parks 1935, and C. intermedius Parks 1923. In 1975 Peter Dodson studied {{the differences between the}} skulls and crests of different species of lambeosaurine dinosaurs. He found that the differences in size and shape may have actually been related to the gender <b>and</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> the animal. Now only one species is recognized for certain, C. casuarius, although C. intermedius has been recognized as valid in some studies. It is based on specimen ROM 776, a skull found by Levi Sternberg in 1920 and was named by William Parks in 1923, who had originally named it Stephanosaurus intermedius earlier that year. The specific name of C. intermedius is derived from its apparent intermediate position according to Parks. C. intermedius lived at a slightly later time in the Campanian than C. casuarius, and the two species are not identical, which supported the separation of them in a 2009 study.|$|E

40|$|Moisture {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} parameters that can accelerate ageing in paper/pressboard insulation. In order to understand the impact <b>of</b> moisture <b>and</b> <b>ageing</b> on Frequency Domain Spectroscopy (FDS) measurements, oil impregnated pressboard samples of different moisture contents are prepared <b>and</b> <b>aged</b> at 105 °C temperature. FDS measurements on pressboard samples are carried out at different ageing time. Other measurements such as moisture, degree of polymerization (DP), Furan and Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) are also performed on oil and pressboard samples. It is observed that FDS measurements on pressboard samples are mostly influenced by the moisture contents. Several other pressboard samples are prepared under different conditions to determine how FDS measurements are affected by moisture, <b>aged</b> oil <b>and</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> pressboard sample considering each of the parameter individually as well as in different combinations. Results suggest that FDS measurements are sensitive to the change in moisture, <b>ageing</b> products <b>and</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> pressboard (DP) sample. However, impact <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> products <b>and</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> pressboard sample (DP) on FDS measurements are smaller in comparison to moisture...|$|R
