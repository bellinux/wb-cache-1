2500|$|Before its {{establishment}} as a Republic, Rome {{was ruled}} by kings (Latin reges, singular rex). In Roman tradition, Rome's founder Romulus was the first. Servius Tullius was the sixth, {{and his successor}} Tarquinius Superbus (Tarquin the Proud) was the last. The nature of Roman kingship is unclear; most Roman kings were elected by the senate, as to a lifetime magistracy, but some claimed succession through dynastic or divine right. Some were native Romans, others were foreign. Later Romans had a complex ideological relationship with this distant past. In Republican mores and institutions kingship was abhorrent; and remained so, in name at least, during the Empire. On the one hand, Romulus was held to have brought Rome into being more-or-less at a stroke, so complete and purely Roman in its essentials that any <b>acceptable</b> <b>change</b> or reform thereafter must be clothed as restoration. On the other, Romans of the Republic and Empire saw each king as contributing in some distinctive and novel way to the city's fabric and territories, or its social, military, religious, legal or political institutions. Servius Tullius {{has been described as}} Rome's [...] "second founder", [...] "the most complex and enigmatic" [...] of all its kings, and a kind of [...] "proto-Republican magistrate".|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{explore the}} {{differences}} in narrative between patients with persistent non-specific low back pain (PLBP) who benefited from a pain management programme, {{and those who did}} not benefit. METHOD: We conducted interviews with 20 patients attending a pain management programme; prior to attending the programme, immediately following the programme and at one year. Our analysis focused on a theoretical sample of patients who either described dramatic life improvements at one year, and who described themselves as much worse. We used the methods of grounded theory. RESULTS: We found that finding hope was central to good outcome. Patients restored hope by making certain changes; (a) deconstructing specific fears, (b) constructing an acceptable explanatory model (c) reconstructing self identity by making <b>acceptable</b> <b>changes.</b> Those who had not restored hope retained fears of loss of self, remained committed to the biomedical model and were unable to make <b>acceptable</b> <b>changes.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may help to operationalise the restoration of hope in patients with PLBP. Firstly, health care professionals need to identify and resolve any specific fears of movement. Secondly, patients need an acceptable explanatory model that fits their experience and personal narrative. Finally our study confirms the centrality of self concept to recovery...|$|R
50|$|Limits of <b>acceptable</b> <b>change</b> was {{the first}} of the post {{carrying}} capacity visitor management frameworks developed to respond to the practical and conceptual failures of carrying capacity. The framework was developed by The U.S. forest service in the 1980s. It is based on the idea that rather than there being a threshold of visitor numbers, in fact any tourist activity is having an impact and therefore management should be based on constant monitoring of the site as well as the objectives established for it. It is possible that with in the Limit of <b>acceptable</b> <b>change</b> framework a visitor limit can be established but such limits are only one tool available. The framework is frequently summarised in to a nine step process.1. Identify area concerns and issues.2. Define and describe opportunity classes (based on the concept of ROS).3. Select indicators of resource and social conditions.4. Inventory existing resource and social conditions.5. Specify standards for resource and social indicators for each opportunity class.6. Identify alternative opportunity class allocations.7. Identify management actions for each alternative.8. Evaluate and select preferred alternatives.9. Implement actions and monitor conditions. The reader should note however, that there is a difference of LAC as a concept and LAC as a planning framework.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason for}} {{considering}} carrying capacity as a process, {{rather than a}} means of protection of various areas is {{in spite of the}} fact that carrying capacity was once a guiding concept in recreation and tourism management literature. Because of its conceptual elusiveness, lack of management utility and inconsistent effectiveness in minimising visitors' impacts, carrying capacity has been largely re-conceptualized into management by objectives approaches, namely: the limits of <b>acceptable</b> <b>change</b> (LAC), and the visitor experience and resource protection (VERP) as the two planning and management decision-making processes based on the new understanding of carrying capacity (Lindberg and McCool, 1998). These two have been deemed more appropriate in the tourism planning processes of protected areas, especially in the United States, and have over the years been adapted and modified for use in sustainable tourism and ecotourism contexts (Wallace, 1993; McCool, 1994; Harroun and Boo, 1995).|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{changes in}} patient-reported {{outcomes}} is indispensable for {{interpretation of results}} from clinical studies. As a consequence the term “minimal clinically important difference” (MCID) was coined in the late 1980 s to ease classification of patients into improved, not changed or deteriorated. Several methodological categories have been developed determining the MCID, however, all are subject to weaknesses or biases reducing {{the validity of the}} reported MCID. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the reproducibility and validity of a novel method for estimating low back pain (LBP) patients’ view of an <b>acceptable</b> <b>change</b> (MCIDpre) before treatment begins. One-hundred and forty-seven patients with chronic LBP were recruited from an out-patient hospital back pain unit and followed over an 8 -week period. Original and modified versions of the Oswestry disability index (ODI), Bournemouth questionnaire (BQ) and numeric pain rating scale (NRSpain) were filled in at baseline. The modified questionnaires determined what the patient considered an acceptable post-treatment outcome which allowed us to calculate the MCIDpre. Concurrent comparisons between the MCIDpre, instrument measurement error and a retrospective approach of establishing the minimal clinically important difference (MCIDpost) were made. The results showed the prospective acceptable outcome method scores to have acceptable reproducibility outside measurement error. MCIDpre was 4. 5 larger for the ODI and 1. 5 times larger for BQ and NRSpain compared to the MCIDpost. Furthermore, MCIDpre and patients post-treatment <b>acceptable</b> <b>change</b> was almost equal for the NRSpain but not for the ODI and BQ. In conclusion, chronic LBP patients have a reasonably realistic idea of an <b>acceptable</b> <b>change</b> in pain, but probably an overly optimistic view of changes in functional and psychological/affective domains before treatment begins...|$|E
