5|$|In 2014, {{district}} court judge Ricardo Rodriguez campaigned to unseat Guerra as district attorney, and the Garza case arose as a campaign issue. Rodriguez said that he wanted justice for the Garza family. He {{said that he would}} take <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Garza's case if he were elected. Rodriguez won the election. In the days after the vote was announced, Guerra sought to appoint Rodriguez as a special prosecutor in the Garza case. Rodriguez declined, saying that he preferred to take <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the evidence once he took control of the district attorney's office in January 2015. In April, he announced that the Garza case was open again. Without mentioning any suspects or elaborating on new evidence, he said that several employees in his office were working on the case.|$|E
5|$|The {{other major}} {{influence}} was the Gaia hypothesis, that the Earth {{is a single}} living system that self-regulates to maintain the optimum conditions for life, formulated by climate scientist James Lovelock and popularised in his 1979 book Gaia: <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> life on Earth. Kennedy Martin used the name GAIA for the environmental organisation Emma Craven was involved in and drew the notion for the black flowers seen at the serial's conclusion from a passage in Lovelock's book that describes a dark marsh grass that grew {{on the surface of}} the Earth trapping heat during a time when the planet was too cold to sustain life, simulated in Lovelock's Daisyworld model.|$|E

50|$|In 1978, Neft & Cohen {{published}} Pro Football: The Early Years, <b>a</b> startling <b>new</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{professional football}} before 1933. Because the National Football League hadn't kept official statistics {{in its first}} thirteen seasons, knowledge of the period was extremely limited.

The result was <b>a</b> remarkable <b>new</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the teams and players from the NFL's earliest seasons.|$|R

25|$|The mythological {{name was}} revived in 1979 by James Lovelock, in Gaia: <b>A</b> <b>New</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> Life on Earth; his Gaia {{hypothesis}} {{was supported by}} Lynn Margulis. The hypothesis proposes that living organisms and inorganic material {{are part of a}} dynamical system that shapes the Earth's biosphere, and maintains the Earth as a fit environment for life. In some Gaia theory approaches, the Earth itself is viewed as an organism with self-regulatory functions. Further books by Lovelock and others popularized the Gaia Hypothesis, which was embraced to some extent by New Age environmentalists as part of the heightened awareness of environmental concerns of the 1990s.|$|E
