Such housings overcome issues of residents’ privacy, which is a major reason for interpersonal conflicts in the cultural context (Susilawati and Al-Surf 2011). A dual phenomenon in housing characterized by (i) adoption of villa and its allied innovations and (ii) revival of Arab style of house and the adaption of villa into a courtyard-type dwelling unit (Rahmaan et al. 1990) is preferred.

Finding the situation uproariously funny, he did not administer the punishment. He also threw himself into the task of fighting for his teaching staff, succeeding in increasing both pay and rights for housemasters, and recruited young graduates constantly to modernise the range of teachers. Despite his own enthusiasm for boxing, when one new recruit was put in charge of gym and expressed his opposition to the sport, key to the school at the time, Chenevix-Trench agreed to his arguments (which were backed by the school medical officer) and it was abolished in July 1963. Although he exercised active but respectful involvement in his housemasters' running of their houses, Bradfield also saw the first signs of real problems caused by his administrative or communicative carelessness; heads of departments could find new staff appointed under them without being informed, much less consulted, staff <b>accommodation</b> <b>arrangements</b> were sometimes random, and he found the important consideration of the school timetable arrangements to be completely outside his sense of priorities.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Clients’ {{perspective}} {{on the quality of}} audiology care has not been investigated thoroughly. Research has focused primarily on satisfaction with, and limitations of hearing aids. We developed a Consumer Quality Index (CQI) questionnaire ‘Audiology Care’ to systematically assess client experiences with audiology care. Design: The CQI Audiology Care was developed in three steps: (1) posing open-ended questions through e-mail (n[*]=[*] 14), (2) two small-scale surveys assessing psychometric properties of the questionnaire (n[*]=[*] 188) and importance of quality aspects (n[*]=[*] 118), and (3) a large-scale survey (n[*]=[*] 1793) assessing psychometric properties and discriminatory power of the questionnaire. Study sample: People with complex hearing impairments and/or balance and communicative disorders who visited an audiology care centre during the past year. Results: Important quality aspects were translated into seven reliable scales: accommodation and facilities, employees’ conduct and expertise, arrangement of appointments, waiting times, client participation and effectiveness of treatment. Client experiences differed among the participating centres concerning <b>accommodation</b> and facilities, <b>arrangement</b> of appointments, waiting times and client participation.
