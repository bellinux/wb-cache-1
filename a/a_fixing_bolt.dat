50|$|Most {{motorcycles}} of {{this period}} tensioned the primary chain by drawing or rotating the gearbox backwards on a hinge with threaded rods, this was known as pre-unit construction. The first A7 had <b>a</b> <b>fixed</b> gearbox, <b>bolted</b> {{to the back of}} the crankcase, and an internal tensioner for the duplex primary chain. This gave it the appearance of unit construction and pioneered the system later used in unit-construction engines such as the BSA C15, BSA B40, Triumph 3TA and so on. However, in 1954 a re-design reverted to the older system. The electrics (as was universal for larger British motorcycles of the period) consisted of two independent systems, the very reliable and self-contained Lucas magneto, with a dynamo generator to charge the battery and provide lights. Carburation was a single Amal remote float Type 6 until 1955 when it was upgraded to a 376 Monobloc.|$|R
2500|$|Bohr's {{response}} was to illustrate Einstein's idea more clearly using the diagram in Figure C. (Figure C shows <b>a</b> <b>fixed</b> screen S1 that is bolted down. Then try to imagine one that can slide up or down along a rod instead of <b>a</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>bolt.)</b> Bohr observes that extremely precise knowledge of any (potential) vertical motion of the screen is an essential presupposition in Einstein's argument. In fact, if its velocity in the direction X before {{the passage of the}} particle is not known with a precision substantially greater than that induced by the recoil (that is, if it were already moving vertically with an unknown and greater velocity than that which it derives {{as a consequence of the}} contact with the particle), then the determination of its motion after the passage of the particle would not give the information we seek. However, Bohr continues, an extremely precise determination of the velocity of the screen, when one applies the principle of indeterminacy, implies an inevitable imprecision of its position in the directionX. [...] Before the process even begins, the screen would therefore occupy an indeterminate position at least to a certain extent (defined by the formalism). Now consider, for example, the point d in figure A, where the interference is destructive. It is obvious that any displacement of the first screen would make the lengths of the two paths, a–b–d and a–c–d, different from those indicated in the figure. If the difference between the two paths varies by half a wavelength, at point d there will be constructive rather than destructive interference. [...] The ideal experiment must average over all the possible positions of the screen S1, and, for every position, there corresponds, for <b>a</b> certain <b>fixed</b> point F, <b>a</b> different type of interference, from the perfectly destructive to the perfectly constructive. The effect of this averaging is that the pattern of interference on the screen F will be uniformly grey. Once more, our attempt to evidence the corpuscular aspects in S2 has destroyed the possibility of interference in F, which depends crucially on the wave aspects.|$|R

Where the radius arm meets the vehicle body, it is attached by a vertical bolt passing through a large Metalastic bush that is pressed into the forward end of the radius arm. Safety straps retain the radius arms in proximity to the vehicle body should one of the front securing bolts happen to come loose.|$|R

40|$|Precast {{concrete}} {{design and}} product qualities {{are most effective}} {{in the growth of}} the precast industry. Zeolite concrete is one of the factors, which will contribute m improving the quality of many precast structural elements such as walls, beams, etc. This thesis is in two parts. The first part presents a study of fresh concrete properties, which are water content, slump, strength and cost of product. Tests were undertaken in four groups of concrete adopted. The first group (B) was of a standard mix proportion of 30 MPa. The second group (F) had partial replacement of cement with fly ash. The third group (S) had partial replacement of sand with granulated blast-furnace slag in a concrete mix that had the highest strength obtained from group (F). The fourth group (Z) had partial replacement of coarse aggregate (blue metal) with zeolite in a concrete mix that had the highest strength obtained from groups (F) and (S) to evaluate the effective of adding zeolite in fly-ash-slag concrete. Zeolite in concrete is seen to improve the freshness (workability) and hardness (strength) properties of the fly-ash-slag concrete. The second part of the thesis considers a particular connection. Connections are most important for precast structural elements. This thesis presents a study of strength and deformation behaviour of floor-wall connections in precast reinforced concrete walls in a plant building. Three half-scale walls and floors moulds were designed, built and tested in the structural laboratory to evaluate the deflection, strain and stress behaviour of steel connections, <b>fixing</b> <b>bolts,</b> walls and floor edge beams. The design of the walls was based on the structural analysis of precast concrete walls of a one storey plant typical of a commercial building. The load analysis and design of the concrete walls, steel reinforcement, steel connection and <b>fixing</b> <b>bolts,</b> their configuration and manufacturing were according to Australian standard recommendations. The three tests undertaken had different types of concrete strength. The first two walls had different types of reinforcing steel and different steel connections. The third wall, adopted after the first and second walls were tested and evaluated, allowed reasonable evaluation of the deformation behaviour. The load-deflection and strain curves of wall, floor, connection and <b>fixing</b> <b>bolts</b> were compared between the laboratory tests and the computer analysis using Strand 6 program. Also the rotation of the floor slab when failure occurred was evaluated to determine its effect on the behavior of the connection and the wall. The connections and walls demonstrated satisfactory moment resistance and shear capacities. The test results confirmed that this connection and <b>fixing</b> <b>bolts</b> would give satisfactory load capacity and ductility performance, and that they can safely carry the applicable loads [...] The connection can be safely applied to precast reinforced concrete elements in a commercial building. The crack behaviour for the three walls was studied, and conclusions were made, based on the test results and the analysis of computer results. Recommendations for future work are also given...|$|R
