His diverse work, although scattered and largely incomplete, drew critical praise for its original takes on various subjects, and primarily for its views on the posthumously published writings of national poet Mihai Eminescu. In tandem, the implications of Negoiţescu's private life and the various aspects of his biography, such as his relationship to exposed Securitate informant Petru Romoşan and the revelations of his unpublished diary, have remained topics of controversy in the years after his death.|$|E
2500|$|A special {{portion of}} Negoiţescu's essays {{deals with the}} meeting point between the {{currents}} of Romanian nationalism and the themes recovered by the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. During his exile years, he was especially vocal in condemning Constantin Noica's late essays, which communist authorities tolerated for their critique of the Western world. To Noica's claim that Westerners had been pushed to [...] "hate the world", forgetting their roots and heading for a collective disaster, he replied: [...] "Is there now {{a place in the}} world that is more evidently heading for catastrophe than Romania is? [...] Where has the world been tarnished and where is it still tarnished more than in Noica's homeland? Where o where is European culture more degraded at this time than in the country where the very monuments of European significance and value are being more and more systematically torn down or mutilated in every way conceivable?" [...] Deeming his adversary's statements [...] "an offense to liberty itself", Negoiţescu also placed Noica's isolationism and <b>anti-Europeanism</b> in connection with a common attitude in post-World War II Romania. According to this claim, the country had been abandoned by Europe: [...] "like Noica, whose writings have no echo in the Occident, [...] feel that they are shouting in the desert and curse the desert which does not hear and does not answer them." [...] He believed to have identified the roots of this mentality in the political and cultural clashes of the Cold War, extending his earlier comments regarding the continental alignment of Romanian culture: [...] "after 1947 our culture has been forcefully torn from its natural European context." ...|$|E
50|$|While {{having some}} overlaps, Euroscepticism and <b>anti-Europeanism</b> are different. <b>Anti-Europeanism</b> {{has always had}} a strong {{influence}} in American culture and American exceptionalism, which sometimes sees Europe on the decline or as a rising rival power, or both. Some aspects of Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom have been mirrored by U.S. authors.|$|E

5000|$|An ideological {{divide between}} reverence for {{continental}} European refinery and classics and xenophobic sentiment {{has existed for}} centuries, but Euroscepticism {{is different from the}} <b>anti-Europeanism</b> more prevalent in American culture. Britain's foreign policy stance of relatively minimal involvement in European affairs, on the other hand, was characterised as [...] "splendid isolation" [...] back in the late 19th century.|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{designating}} {{itself as}} a centre-left party, the party moved towards the mainstream right and, in March 2000, renamed itself the 'People's Party - Movement for a Democratic Slovakia' (ĽS-HZDS) to try to achieve membership of the European People's Party (EPP). [...] However, lingering memories of former <b>anti-Europeanism,</b> conflicting rhetoric, {{and the presence of}} three Slovak parties already in the EPP prevented this. [...] The ĽS-HZDS then looked to the Euro-integrationist European Democratic Party, which it joined in 2009.|$|E

50|$|In {{books and}} {{articles}} over the last decade, Italian political scientist Sergio Fabbrini has been scrambling to understand the recent ebb and flow in transatlantic relations. Anti-Americanism in Europe and <b>anti-Europeanism</b> in the United States, Fabbrini argues in America and Its Critics, have challenged the viability of NATO and, prior to Obama’s election, called into question the ability to cooperate on global concerns from terrorism to global warming. At the same time, however, Fabbrini has devoted several articles and an entire book, Compound Democracies, to the thesis that the United States and Europe are converging at an institutional level as examples {{of what he calls}} “compound democracies.” Over the long term, in other words, the two political systems are becoming more alike even as the politicians themselves, in the short term, articulate a different set of political values.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{opposition}} parties and critics also consider Orbán {{an opponent of}} European integration. In 2000, {{opposition parties}} MSzP and SzDSz and the left-wing press presented Orbán's comment that [...] "there's life outside the EU" [...] as proof of his <b>anti-Europeanism</b> and sympathies with the radical right. In the same press conference, Orbán clarified that [...] "we're {{trying to make the}} accession fast because it may boost the growth of Hungary's economy". Six years later, in 2006, Orbán stated at an international conference that the European Union should not give any moral help to the Hungarian MSzP-SzDSz government due to their [...] "lies and cheats" [...] (referring to the Őszödi speech). In response, some government officials claimed that Orbán had [...] "attacked his own country" [...] and called him a traitor of his homeland. Orbán later denied he was talking about aid monies in his speech.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{the main}} source of Euroscepticism has been the notion that {{integration}} weakens the nation state, and a desire to slow, halt or reverse integration within the EU. Other views often held by Eurosceptics include perceptions of a democratic deficit in the European Union or a belief that the EU is too bureaucratic. Euroscepticism {{should not be confused with}} <b>anti-Europeanism,</b> which refers to the rejection of the culture of Europe and Europeanisation, and sentiments, opinions and discrimination against European ethnic groups. A Eurobarometer survey of EU citizens in 2009 showed that support for membership of the EU was lowest in Latvia, the United Kingdom (UK) and Hungary. By 2016, the countries viewing the EU most unfavourably were Greece, France, Spain and the UK. Euroscepticism is found in political parties across the political spectrum; however, the rise in populist right-wing parties in Europe is strongly linked to a rise in Euroscepticism on the continent.|$|E

40|$|In the {{following}} sections, I {{will argue that}} although opinions about Portuguese membership in the EU have ceased to {{play a crucial role}} both in party appeals and electoral behavior, {{that is not the case}} in what concerns their impact on other forms of political behavior and attitudes. More specifically, I will suggest that the decline in electoral turnout currently experienced in Portugal, particularly since 1995, cannot be fully understood with exploring the combination between resilient Euroscepticism among a minority of the population and the depoliticization of Europe at the level of political élites. Furthermore, I will also suggest that, under the present conditions, <b>anti-Europeanism</b> may have developed into a more permanent and disturbing set of political attitudes of mistrust in, and disengagement from, domestic political institutions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{and tries to}} explain the rise of anti-European and Eurosceptical sentiment in the United States {{since the end of}} the Cold War. Contrary to <b>anti-Europeanism,</b> which has always permeated American culture and underpinned American exceptionalism, Euroscepticism is more confined to political and business elites and targets the process, main policies and identity of the European Union. Although usually conservative, Anti-Europeans and Eurosceptics do not necessarily overlap: anti-Europeans are Eurosceptical but the reverse is not necessarily true. However, <b>Anti-Europeanism</b> and Euroscepticism have become entrenched beliefs among many conservatives. Europe's positive image since WWII and the wide support for European unification among American elites, have been replaced by competing views: for example, neo-conservatives believe Europe to be in economic, demographic and cultural decline that the EU only precipitates. Others see a unifying Europe as a rising power which will become more a rival than an ally for the US. Since the early 1990 s and increasingly until the war in Iraq, conservative commentators have attacked the style and content of European foreign policy, especially with regard to the Middle-East, Europe's weak defence budgets, its lack of resolve against terrorism, its welfare state and highly regulated economy, its left-leaning political culture, its growing anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism. The centralizing, elitist and regulatory aspects of the EU have also been denounced to justify Euroscepticism. The paper reviews and discusses possible explanations for such trends: a backlash against rising anti-Americanism in Europe? The projection of US domestic politics? The import of British Euroscepticism? The demise of communism and the Soviet Union and the common threat they represented? America's new hegemonic ambitions? The rising influence of American conservatives? Clashes over globalization? A resurgent awareness of deep differences in political and economic cultures, which help cast Europe as the anti-model? The answer lies most likely in a combination of such factors. international relations...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction]. In {{order to}} examine the interplay of the {{national}} and the doctrinal in the current orientation of the party, {{we need to look}} at how the myths underpinning Labour doctrine inform its language, and how language, in turn, facilitates further doctrinal change. In the case of the Labour Party, as we shall see, one of the most consequential results of such imperceptible interactions is the anti-Europeans' failure to hold on to claims of exclusive doctrinal integrity concerning Europe. But we shall also note the continuing ambivalence in party attitudes, as reflected in its language. In {{order to examine}} these subtle movements in ideas, we shall examine the treatment of the European question in a recent party document. We will also examine the extent to which <b>anti-Europeanism</b> still informs the wider political culture...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores which {{long-term}} ideological considerations can {{be considered}} to have shaped the critical U. S. position regarding NATO during the George W. Bush administration in 2002 - 2003. The thesis examines the fundamental view of George W. Bush and his principal foreign policy officials on America's {{role in the world}} and its relationship with Europe in the crucial post- 9 / 11 years. It explores the mental maps that defined the way foreign policy officials in the U. S. perceived the relationship to Europe and the influence of these mental maps on the U. S. position regarding NATO. Themes such as neoconservatism, <b>anti-Europeanism</b> and unilateralism will be discussed, as they are structures into which the ideas of the Bush administration's principal foreign policy officials can be placed. The thesis analyzes whether the ideas underlying policy regarding NATO in 2002 - 2003 were a continuation of ideas that originated much earlier, or whether the decisions made in these years mark a clear breaking point with the way NATO was perceived before...|$|E
30|$|The {{emergence}} of anti-European extremism {{in the party}} landscape in Europe {{goes hand in hand}} with this crisis of democracy. <b>Anti-Europeanism</b> or hard Euroscepticism [27] is characterized by opposition to the European Union as a matter of principle. Soft Euroscepticism is opposed to a further European integration. Both forms have become stronger in the last years. Today, Eurosceptic parties from the extreme right and from the extreme left have more seats in the European Parliament than ever before. Right wing extremism is on the way to entering a fifth stage of its development since the Second World War which is the stage of supranationalization. Although it still remains difficult for anti-Europeans to unite at supranational level, they have taken the first steps in this direction and would appear to be becoming stronger. The openly anti-EU Parliamentary Groups, Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy, won 48 seats in the last elections, the soft-Eurosceptic European Conservative and Reformists Group has 71 members. Trends 1 to 3 of the rising gap between elites and citizens directly support trend 4, anti-European extremism. It is thus presumable that unless inequality and mistrust are stopped, the share of anti-European parties especially from the nationalist right-extremists will increase in the next European Parliament that is elected in 2019.|$|E
