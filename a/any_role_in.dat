5|$|The insects {{captured}} by the glandular trichomes {{are too small to}} serve <b>any</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> pollination. It is unclear, however, whether these plants evolved the ability to trap and kill insects as an adaptation to low environmental nutrient availability or simply a defensive mechanism against insects damaging flower parts.|$|E
5|$|While on Team Str8 Rippin in 2005, Leto {{stated that}} their style was unique, since any team member might take on <b>any</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> their attack formation. They were also patient, content to wait their enemies out {{and force the}} {{opposing}} team to attack when Str8 Rippin is ahead. Zyos insisted upon his teammates being silent and not trash-talking during matches {{in order to maintain}} focus.|$|E
5|$|Although Shaw's unmasking scene {{lasted only}} {{two minutes and}} seven seconds and {{included}} just 24 words of dialogue spoken by Shaw, he received more fan mail and autograph requests from Return of the Jedi than he had for <b>any</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> {{the rest of his}} career. He later reflected that he very much enjoyed his experience filming for Return of the Jedi and expressed particular surprise that an action figure was made of him from the film.|$|E

5|$|In {{many modern}} Islamist movements, {{women have been}} relegated to a {{domestic}} role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook {{during the course of}} da'wa tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household. Women do not play <b>any</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the higher echelons of the movement, but their opinions are taken into due considerations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} time Zelanti, also began to incline to give their support to Ganganelli, looking upon him as {{indifferent}} or even favourable to the Jesuits. It seems that the attitude of Zelanti was decided by the secret negotiations between their leaders Alessandro and Gian Francesco Albani and the Spanish cardinals. Cardinal de Bernis, the nominal leader of the court faction, probably did not play <b>any</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the appointment of Ganganelli and only followed the instructions of Marquis d'Aubeterre when all had been already known.|$|E

On 24 March 2012, American investigators {{said they believe}} Bales split the killings in the villages of Balandi and Alkozai into two attacks, returning to Camp Belamby after the first attack before slipping out again an hour later. No other U.S. military personnel were disciplined for having <b>any</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the incident.|$|E

5|$|The AFL was {{confined}} to an enclave around the capital during the conflict, and did not play a significant part in the fighting. Elections in July 1997 finally brought Taylor to power. Under the accords, {{which led to a}} break in fighting in 1996 and the Liberian general election, 1997, ECOMOG was to retrain a new national army based on fair ethnic and geographical representation. Yet Taylor denied ECOMOG <b>any</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the restructuring of the AFL, and the force eventually left Liberia by the end of 1998.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November 1864, {{before the}} siege of Paysandú, the Paraguayan {{dictator}} Solano López seized the Brazilian steamer Marquês de Olinda, beginning the Paraguayan War. While the Army of the South crossed Uruguay heading toward Paysandú, Brazil's government sent José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco) to replace Saraiva. He arrived in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires on 2 December {{and a few days}} later sought a formal alliance with Mitre against the Blancos. The Argentine president refused, insisting that neither he nor his government had <b>any</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> Flores' rebellion, and that Argentina would remain neutral. On 26 December, the Paraguayans invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso, laying waste to towns and the countryside.|$|E
5|$|The SWAPO {{incursion}} {{became a}} complex political issue, {{and led to}} a week of tense negotiations. The UN considered emergency airlifts to bring more peacekeepers into the territory, and the United States offered aid. On 9 April 1989 an agreement was reached at Mount Etjo (the Mount Etjo Declaration), calling for the rapid deployment of UNTAG forces and outlining a withdrawal procedure for PLAN soldiers (Operation Safe Passage) under which they would leave the country. Operation Piddock was the name for the Australian part of the operation. Horner wrote that if UNTAG were to play <b>any</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> ending the fighting, it was obvious that the Australians would be the key component. This was complex, and required authorisation from Gration and Defence Minister Kim Beazley for Australian troops to supervise the withdrawal of insurgent forces. It required the Australian Army engineers and British signallers to work as infantry, manning border and internal-assembly points. At the time, these were the only units which could be redeployed quickly to northern Namibia.|$|E

5|$|The {{case for}} {{excluding}} Oswiu from <b>any</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> Wighard's election {{is based on}} the theory that Bede misinterpreted a letter from Vitalian to Oswiu as stating that Oswiu was involved in the selection. The historian Nicholas Brooks points out that although Bede may have indeed misread Vitalian's letter, Oswiu had other reasons for involving himself in Deusdedit's replacement, not least of which was a concern that the exiled Northumbrian bishop Wilfrid, who was in Kent and Mercia at the time, not be selected as the new archbishop. The historian D. P. Kirby sees Oswiu's involvement in Wighard's selection as an attempt to help restore the Anglo-Saxon church, and perhaps as the beginning of steps to secure York as an archbishopric. Brooks points out that one reason Wighard might have journeyed to Rome was to receive his pallium. As it had been the normal practice up until then to have it sent out to England by the papacy, Wighard's travel to Rome would indicate the papacy's approval of his election and ensure the validity of his consecration.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{are not well}} understood, but numerous abnormalities of brain structure have been reported. The most thoroughly investigated alterations involve the cerebral cortex, but effects on the hippocampus have also been described. Many reports have found reductions {{in the size of}} the hippocampus in schizophrenic subjects. The left hippocampus seems to be affected more than the right. The changes noted have largely been accepted to be the result of abnormal development. It is unclear whether hippocampal alterations play <b>any</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> causing the psychotic symptoms that are the most important feature of schizophrenia. It has been suggested that on the basis of experimental work using animals, hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in the basal ganglia, thereby indirectly affecting the integration of information in the prefrontal cortex. It has also been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction might account for the disturbances in long-term memory frequently observed.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} {{member of the}} new ensemble was Laura Peverara, followed by Livia d'Arco and Anna Guarini, daughter of the prolific poet Giovanni Battista Guarini. Giovanni wrote poems for many of the madrigals which were set for the ensemble, and choreographed scenes for the balletto delle donne. Judith Tick believes Tarquinia Molza sang with the group, but Anthony Newcomb says she was involved solely as an advisor and instructor. Whether Tarquinia Molza ever performed with them or not, she was ousted from <b>any</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the group after her affair with the composer Giaches de Wert came to light in 1589. Luzzasco Luzzaschi directed and composed music to showcase the ensemble, and accompanied them on the harpsichord. Ippolito Fiorini was the maestro di capella, in charge of the entire court's musical activities. In addition to his duties to the overall court, he accompanied the concerto on the lute. Vittorio Baldini was brought to the court as ducal music printer in 1582.|$|E
