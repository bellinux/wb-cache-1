40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a flight test program to determine the effects on landings of wide variations in <b>approach</b> path angle <b>and</b> <b>approach</b> airspeed for different kinds of piloting technique. Over 400 landings were made at approach speeds from 60 to 120 mph <b>and</b> <b>approach</b> path angles from 3 to 18 deg. Several variations of pilot technique involving different operations of the throttle/spoiler control were investigated. It is shown that very large ranges of airspeed <b>and</b> <b>approach</b> path angle can be accommodated with rather moderate penalties in landing distance and difficulty. With the spoiler-equipped aircraft, the best approach speeds are considerably higher than would be usable without spoilers, <b>and</b> <b>approach</b> path angles can be used which are far beyond those normally possible without spoilers...|$|R

5|$|In most jumping spiders, {{the main}} eyes focus {{accurately}} on an object {{up to about}} 75cm away. However, P. schultzi does not react at all to objectives when the light is under 100lux. Between 100 and 500lux, it detects <b>and</b> <b>approaches</b> the objective from distances up to 6cm, from 500lux to 1500lux, its response distance increases gradually {{to a maximum of}} about 10cm, and stronger light causes no increase in the response distance. For comparison, Trite auricoma swivels towards a movement up to 75cm away <b>and</b> <b>approaches</b> targets from about 20cm. Perhaps P. schultzi gains little from being alerted to objectives at distances because this spider moves so slowly that it is very unlikely to reach a more distant target in time to catch it.|$|E

The show's main story arc includes fictional characters and events from the American Civil War. While working as a medical intern in the facility, the lead character Dr. Mitchell Grace (Grayson McCouch) encounters various spirits and discovers that the doctors are running unethical experiments on their patients. The executive producers included Aaron Spelling, E. Duke Vincent, and Mark Frost.

Expecting Joyce will keep it a secret, as she promised, she is shocked when the local news reveals her participation in the making of the pornography, and Lois is made a social outcast.|$|E

5|$|Batman: Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game {{viewed from}} the third-person perspective. The playable {{character}} is visible {{on the screen and}} the camera can be freely rotated around him. The player controls Batman as he traverses Arkham Asylum, a secure facility for the criminally insane located off the coast of Gotham City. The opening areas of the game are linear, serving as a tutorial for the moves <b>and</b> <b>approaches</b> available to the player. Once the player emerges onto the island he can freely explore the game world, although some areas remain inaccessible until certain milestones in the main story. Batman can run, jump, climb, crouch, glide from heights using his cape, and use his grapple gun to climb low structures or escape to higher ledges.|$|E
5|$|Between 16:50 and 17:07, {{there was}} an {{exchange}} of small arms fire between the JNA troops in the Corps headquarters and a nearby police checkpoint, and at 17:35 a mortar attack was launched by the 32nd Mechanised Brigade. The mortar fire targeted the police station and surrounding buildings, and an electrical substation in the nearby village of Nedeljanec. The civilian authorities in Varaždin promptly notified the European Community Monitoring Mission of damage to the city. By 16 September, the JNA artillery bombardment of the city had extended to various street intersections <b>and</b> <b>approaches</b> to the Drava bridge on the Varaždin–Čakovec road. The latter was counter-battery fire, targeting ZNG mortars which fired approximately 150 bombs against the JNA during the entire operation. By the end of 16 September, 42 JNA officers and soldiers had deserted from the 32nd Mechanised Brigade. The JNA ordered its border guards posted along the Hungarian border from Čakovec to Ludbreg to lay land mines around their facilities, then cross into Hungary and surrender to that country's authorities.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the final}} {{surrender}} of the Confederate States of America in 1865, Fort Jackson was abandoned. The lumber used in its construction was promptly salvaged for firewood and construction materials and, {{due to its}} proximity to the Long Bridge, the earthworks were flattened {{in order to provide}} easier access to Long Bridge. In the early 20th century, the fort's site was used for the footings <b>and</b> <b>approaches</b> to several bridges connecting Virginia and Washington. Today, no trace of the fort remains, though the site of the fort is contained within Arlington County's Long Bridge Park, and a National Park Service 2004 survey of the site indicated some archaeological remnants may still remain beneath the park.|$|E
5|$|In Harrison, NY120 passes several mansions on {{both sides}} of the highway as it {{gradually}} turns northwestward <b>and</b> <b>approaches</b> I-287 (the Cross Westchester Expressway). The route parallels the western edge of the freeway for several blocks to Westchester Avenue, where NY120 meets the southern end of NY120A, an alternate route through the easternmost part of Westchester County. While NY120A heads east toward Port Chester, NY120 takes on the Westchester Avenue name as the two directions of the route split to follow collector/distributor roads running northwestward along both sides of I-287. The route remains on the frontage roads for about a half-mile (0.8km) to another section of Purchase Street, where NY120 turns to follow a slightly more northward track through another residential section of Harrison.|$|E
5|$|In {{the project}} to replace the last {{artifact}} that underpins much of the International System of Units (SI), {{a variety of other}} very different technologies <b>and</b> <b>approaches</b> were considered and explored over many years. They too are covered below. Some of these now-abandoned approaches were based on equipment and procedures that would have enabled the reproducible production of new, kilogram-mass prototypes on demand (albeit with extraordinary effort) using measurement techniques and material properties that are ultimately based on, or traceable to, fundamental constants. Others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand-tuned kilogram test masses and which expressed their magnitudes in electrical terms via special components that permit traceability to fundamental constants. All approaches depend on converting a weight measurement to a mass, and therefore require the precise measurement of the strength of gravity in laboratories. All approaches would have precisely fixed one or more constants of nature at a defined value.|$|E
