There are still more ancient towns in Saudi Arabia, but little information is currently available on them. Saudi Arabia occupies a unique and distinctive geographic location, bridging civilizations between continents. In ancient times the Arabian peninsula served as a corridor for trade; therefore it saw the beginning of many civilizations, the relics of which are still evident today. The Saudi government has recently established the Saudi Commission for Tourism and Antiquities, which is responsible for the preservation of these cities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Previous infill, {{unearthed}} and archeological excavations have a {{major influence}} on the structural and physical status of buildings and ruins in urban and <b>archeological</b> <b>areas.</b> <b>Archeological</b> excavation is like an "anaphylactic shock ” on the excavated structure. Mortar, stone and wood quickly change their performance and bring about a dramatic transformation/alteration in the structure's elements and its whole stability. As in a state of anaphylactic shock if you do not intervene promptly the excavated structure can “die off ” explicitly and completely disintegrate. Archeological excavation also reveals peculiar structural elements that were in use but never viewed or studied from the engineering point of view. These elements of the buildings and sites could be either structural connections in strange angles or unstable structure-stone- frames in current day standards and/or static calculations, that did not collapse in the past earthquakes. Studying this archeological-engineering issue might result in a better understanding and therefore implementation of the conservation of excavated sites and buildings...|$|R

However, these efforts have not been sufficient to guarantee {{the preservation of the}} park. As of 2009, there were about 180 families inside the park proper. The 2007 effort made the park and some <b>areas</b> outside an <b>archeological</b> zone under INAH, but the agency has not acted to move those living within the area. Instead it only requires that buildings be no more than two stories tall and to be notified before any major excavation so that salvage operations can be done.

50|$|Leukaspis {{was a large}} port town, with a {{population}} around 15,000. The center of the town featured a basilica and a town hall that was converted into a Christian church. It was probably an important trading center between Egypt and Libya, and {{appears to have been}} a major center for Cretian imports. The settlement was destroyed in 365, when an earthquake off the coast of Crete created a tsunami. The town was not rebuilt, partially due to the crumbling state of the Roman Empire. Leukaspis was lost until 1986, when a group of engineers who were building roads in Marina revealed ancient houses and tombs. 200 acre of surrounding land was designated an <b>archeological</b> <b>area,</b> and excavations began in the 1990s. Prior to the site's discovery, the port area of the settlement was destroyed to make a man-made lagoon for a resort.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two main}} {{landmarks}} {{in the town}} are the Preciosa Sangre de Cristo Church and the Community Museum. The Preciosa Sangre de Cristo Church is the main church {{of the town and}} municipality and was begun in 1581, although not completed until 1758. [...] The facade of the church is made of quarried stone called cantera with decorative stonework in the main entrance and choir window. This church was built on the site of a local Zapotec temple, which was destroyed when the Spanish arrived, replacing it with this church. In the foundations of the church, some of the construction of the original temple can be seen. On the side of the church is a small <b>archeological</b> <b>area.</b> Inside there are traces of 16th century decoration with pre-Hispanic motifs. The interior is also notable for a large number of colonial-era santos or statues of saints, many executed in fine polychrome that is well preserved to the present day. Another religious attraction is the Chapel of Cristo Grande located in a private home on Aquiles Serdan Street.|$|E

With only 2,000 acres of monument land that is not leased, and that land home to ancient archaeological sites and wildlife habitat, four environmental groups have been active to ensure there is no further oil and gas exploration and extraction. However, off road vehicles and an increase in road construction for oil and gas exploration, allow greater access to <b>archeological</b> <b>areas.</b> Large trucks, known as [...] "thumpers" [...] were found searching for oil and gas pockets by pounding the earth and recording the seismic data, having received a [...] "green light" [...] from the Bureau of Land Management. Executive Director of the San Juan Citizens Alliance, Mark Pearson stated: The decision showed a blatant disregard for the proclamation states that leases should only be made to protect and preserve oil and gas resources. That does not bode well for the future management {{for the rest of this}} monument or any monument in the country.|$|R

5000|$|The area is also of archeological {{interest}} {{because of the}} extensive system of irrigation and terraces built by the Zapotecs as many as 2,500 years ago. It was also most likely a sacred site to the ancient peoples of the Oaxaca valley. [...] The canals {{are part of an}} irrigation system which was created more than 2,500 years ago, most of which extend from the Amphitheatre side. Researchers have studied the terraces and canals which have been cut into the sides of the mountains these cliffs are on and have concluded that there were an irrigation system, unique in Mexico. [...] Only vestiges of these irrigation canals remain; however, the <b>archeological</b> <b>area</b> has not been completely explored. These irrigation canals are considered to be unique in Mesoamerica, not only because irrigation was not common in pre-Hispanic Mexico but because they are the only example of lined irrigation canals. It is not known why canal lining does not appear outside of the Hierve el Agua area, and here the lining develops naturally. While seepage and bank erosion were indeed problems with irrigation farming in other parts of Mesoamerica, the nearest example of anything similar is with the Hohokam of southern Arizona in 650 C.E.|$|E

It has a large scale festival every year on August 14 through to August 16known as the Fiesta Patronal. These events are organized by inhabitants of the town with regard to their religious idol. In this case the festivity is with regard to [...] "Santa Maria Asuncion”. Usually this kind of events involved a great variety of activities such as sports, folkloric dances, and fireworks. Every neighborhood of the town has its own religious idol, so when is time to prepare the festivity, a different person is chosen every year to organize the event. In Mexico, on November 2 it is a tradition to celebrate the Day of the Dead, known as [...] "Dia de los Muertos" [...] in which every family honors their dead relatives. In Cacalotepec every family visits their relatives graves and then prepare an ofrenda in which they offer to their loved ones a variety of traditional foods such as mole, tamales, mescal, chocolate, and bread, according to what the dead ancestor enjoyed while they were living.|$|E
50|$|For {{thousands}} of years various cultures of indigenous peoples succeeded each other, living along the Potomac River and its tributaries in the coastal <b>area.</b> <b>Archeological</b> excavations have yielded much data about the prehistoric early cultures. At Indian Point on Potomac Creek, for instance, part of the later Patawomeck <b>area,</b> <b>archeological</b> excavations in the 1930s revealed a Native American burial ground (Potomac Creek, 44ST2). Researchers donated 134 skeletons from the grounds to the Smithsonian Institution.
