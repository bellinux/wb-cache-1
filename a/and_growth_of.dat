After the collapse of Austria-Hungary, the Hungarian population declined, while the German-speaking population was forced or compelled to leave after World War II and similar fate was suffered by the Italian population. Late 19th century and the 20th century were marked by large scale economic migrations abroad. The 1940s and the 1950s in Yugoslavia were marked by internal migrations in Yugoslavia, as well as by urbanisation. The most recent significant migrations came {{as a result of the}} Croatian War of Independence when hundreds of thousands were displaced.|$|E

Further analysis showed that the nucleation <b>and</b> <b>growth</b> mechanism <b>of</b> PPy/ODN was progressive nucleation <b>and</b> 3 D <b>growth,</b> which then changed to instantaneous nucleation <b>and</b> 3 D <b>growth</b> before nucleus overlapping.

He had never planned to run the family winery as his ambition had always been to pursue an officer's career in the Luftwaffe. However, {{in the immediate aftermath}} of World War II the business had virtually ceased to exist and Schnaufer was given the task of rebuilding it from scratch. He had to re-establish business links to suppliers and customers and to consolidate them. Then he had to make new contacts in order to facilitate expansion <b>and</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the business. Lastly, he had to create an infrastructure which supported the growth of the business.|$|E
5|$|Important {{elements}} of traditional Scouting have their origins in Baden-Powell's experiences {{in education and}} military training. He was a 50-year-old retired army general when he founded Scouting, and his revolutionary ideas inspired thousands of young people, {{from all parts of}} society, to get involved in activities that most had never contemplated. Comparable organizations in the English-speaking world are the Boys' Brigade and the non-militaristic Woodcraft Folk; however, they never matched the development <b>and</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> Scouting.|$|E

The task force was established by the 1 March 1944 order of Speer, with support from Erhard Milch of the Reich Aviation Ministry.

40|$|Abstract. Data {{describing}} economic <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> {{human population}} in the United Kingdom are analysed. Contrary to the widely accepted interpretations, Industrial Revolution had no impact on shaping trajectories <b>of</b> economic <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> population. Within the range of analysable data, there was also no Malthusian stagnation. Consequently, there was no escape from Malthusian trap {{because there was no}} trap in the economic <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> in the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> human population. The United Kingdom was the centre of the Industrial Revolution and yet its data are in the direct contradiction of the currently accepted interpretations. It is fortunate that natural processes did not comply with our fanciful and wished-for explanations of the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>growth.</b> If they did, if the generally claimed takeoffs did occur, {{it would have been a}} disaster because economic <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> population would have been already unmanageable everywhere.
