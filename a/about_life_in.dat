5|$|The {{following}} day, Asmoro {{sees the}} businessman, Adjeng's boyfriend, leaving her apartment, which {{puts him in}} a foul mood. He and Adjeng fight, and Asmoro almost smothers Adjeng with a pillow before {{saying that they are}} through. As Adjeng lies on the bed, she recalls how her mother's lover raped her and how her mother murdered him.

5|$|The {{many letters}} in the novel written by Lambert are also based on Balzac's life.

5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered <b>about</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E
5|$|Palmetto Leaves is {{a memoir}} and travel guide written by Harriet Beecher Stowe about her winters {{in the town}} of Mandarin, Florida, {{published}} in 1873. Already famous for having written Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), Stowe came to Florida after the U.S. Civil War (1861–1865). She purchased a plantation near Jacksonville as a place for her son to recover from the injuries he had received as a Union soldier and to make a new start in life. After visiting him, she became so enamored with the region she purchased a cottage and orange grove for herself and wintered there until 1884, even though the plantation failed within its first year. Parts of Palmetto Leaves appeared in a newspaper published by Stowe's brother, as a series of letters and essays <b>about</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> northeast Florida.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{prior to}} 1894 Eberhardt began {{corresponding}} with Eugène Letord, a French officer {{stationed in the}} Sahara who had placed a newspaper advertisement for a pen pal. Eberhardt asked him for every detail he could give her <b>about</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> the Sahara, also informing him of her dreams of escaping Geneva alongside her favourite sibling, Augustin. Letord encouraged {{the two of them}} to relocate to Bône, Algeria, where he could assist them in establishing a new life. In a series of circumstances that remain unclear though involved financial debts and ties to Russian revolutionist groups with which he was affiliated, Augustin fled Geneva in 1894. Eberhardt probably assisted him initially but was unable to keep track of his whereabouts despite making constant inquiries. In November 1894 Eberhardt was informed by a letter that Augustin had joined the French Foreign Legion and was assigned to Algeria. While at first furious with Augustin's decision, Eberhardt's anger did not last; she asked him to send her a detailed diary of what he saw in North Africa.|$|E

5|$|Writing <b>about</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> Victorian Cambridge, Gwen Raverat (granddaughter of Charles Darwin) {{describes}} the 'sport' of Stinkhorn hunting: In our native woods there grows {{a kind of}} toadstool, called in the vernacular The Stinkhorn, though in Latin it bears a grosser name. The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt Etty's great invention. Armed with a basket and a pointed stick, and wearing special hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing here and there, her nostrils twitching, when she {{caught a whiff of}} her prey; then at last, with a deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his putrid carcass into her basket. At the end of the day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; because of the morals of the maids.|$|E
