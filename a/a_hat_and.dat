There are two (2) sycamore trees on the right, the larger one being nearer the center and having a notch cut nearly half way through, from the left side, a short distance above the ground. The woodsman is wearing <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> holding his ax nearly perpendicular on his right. The ax blade is {{turned away from him}} and is even with his hat.|$|E
5|$|Another {{work from}} this time is The Green Feather, which Knight painted, and {{reworked}} due {{to a change in}} the weather, outdoors in a single day and shows the model Dolly Snell in an emerald evening dress with <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> a large feather. Knight sent the painting to an international exhibition held at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and it was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada for £400. Knight started the vast painting Lamorna Birch and his Daughters in 1913, painting in a wood in the Lamorna Valley but then kept the painting unfinished in her studio until finally completing it in 1934, the same year Birch was elected a full member of the Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|Players {{and game}} journalists {{consider}} the game among the Spectrum's best. Sabre Wulf {{was the first}} of four titles in the Sabreman series for the ZX Spectrum. Retro Gamer credited the character's name and character traits for its lasting memorability. As an ordinary human with <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> exaggerated nose, Sabreman fit the video game 8-bit era's character archetype. The last, unreleased game in the Spectrum Sabreman series, Mire Mare, was planned to have been similar to Sabre Wulf in gameplay. Rare, the successor to Ultimate, later released a side-scrolling platformer in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance handheld console—also titled Sabre Wulf—in which Sabreman enlists jungle animals to solve the Sabre Wulf's puzzles. It was not received well by fans. Elements from the original Sabre Wulf appear in other games, including Rare's Jet Force Gemini. Retro Gamer considered Sabreman's recurring appearance to be proof of Rare's interest in the character and series.|$|E

25|$|Zamenhof simply tacked an -o {{onto each}} {{consonant}} {{to create the}} name of the letter, with the vowels representing themselves: a, bo, co, ĉo, do, e, fo, etc. The diacritics are frequently mentioned overtly. For instance, ĉ may be called ĉo ĉapela or co ĉapela, from ĉapelo (<b>a</b> <b>hat),</b> <b>and</b> ŭ may be called ŭo luneta or u luneta, from luno (a moon) plus the diminutive -et-. This is the only system that is widely accepted and in practical use.|$|E

25|$|In 1909 he {{returned}} to the beach in Valencia and again took up themes depicting people at sea. In the portrait Elena en la playa Sorolla portrayed his youngest daughter in a white dress with the beach as a background. In this portrait, from {{about the same time as}} Walk on the Beach, Sorolla painted the meeting of land and sea, the waves of the sea, the dress moving in the wind, <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> the light of a summer day in the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|Twelve {{potential}} Olivers made {{it through}} the audition rounds and performed in the live shows. Each Oliver was identified with a different coloured scarf, and during the first eight live shows, the Oliver who did best in the mission for that week {{made it through}} to the final eight. This Oliver would also receive <b>a</b> <b>hat,</b> <b>and</b> lead vocals in a performance with all the Olivers on the live show. Ultimately, Gwion Jones, Harry Stott and Laurence Jeffcoate were announced as the three winning Olivers in week nine on 24 May.|$|E
25|$|In West Downs {{the only}} {{independent}} councillor, Monique Bonney, held her seat defeating Conservative county councillor Mike Whiting by 41 votes. Meanwhile, the closest result came in Murston where both the Conservative and Liberal Democrat councillors, Ed Gent and Dave Banks, took 420 votes after six recounts. Conservative Ed Gent took the seat after {{his name was}} pulled out of <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> he was therefore given one extra vote. This meant Mike Henderson was the only Liberal Democrat to be elected after he held his seat in Davington Priory.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} the UV Index is to help people {{effectively}} protect themselves from UV radiation, which has health benefits in moderation but in excess causes sunburn, skin aging, DNA damage, skin cancer, immunosuppression, and eye damage such as cataracts (see the section Human health-related effects of ultraviolet radiation). Public health organizations recommend that people protect themselves (for example, by applying sunscreen to the skin and wearing <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> sunglasses) if they spend substantial time outdoors when the UV Index is 3 or higher; see the table below for more-detailed recommendations.|$|E
25|$|Early {{one morning}} Linda and Christine go to Gull Cove and Arlena paddles to Pixy Cove, a secluded beach. She {{says she wants}} {{solitude}} but Poirot suspects a rendezvous. Both Kenneth and Patrick seek Arlena and finally Patrick asks Emily to join her daily row and go to Pixy Cove. There they find a body, lying with arms outstretched, face hidden by <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> red curls peeking out. Patrick stays with the body, while Emily, who is not good at climbing heights, rows back to get the doctor, who diagnoses strangulation by powerful hands, therefore male.|$|E
25|$|Powell {{decided to}} return to Surratt's {{boarding}} house to seek help. His clothes were somewhat bloody from the attack at Seward's home, and he'd dropped his hat at the Seward home. During much of the Victorian era, it was considered unseemly for any man (even a menial laborer) to be seen in public without <b>a</b> <b>hat,</b> <b>and</b> Powell would have been viewed with suspicion had he tried to enter the city without one. Ripping the sleeve from his undershirt, Powell placed the sleeve on his head in the hope that people would think it was a stocking cap. To complete his disguise as a common laborer, he then stole a pickaxe from a farmyard. Powell then headed for Surratt's.|$|E

25|$|Joseph Smith {{would put}} the seer stone into <b>a</b> <b>hat,</b> <b>and</b> put {{his face in the}} hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the {{darkness}} the spiritual light would shine. A piece of something resembling parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing. One character at a time would appear, and under it was the interpretation in English. Brother Joseph would read off the English to Oliver Cowdery, who was his principal scribe, and when it was written down and repeated to Brother Joseph {{to see if it was}} correct, then it would disappear, and another character with the interpretation would appear. Thus the Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God, and not by any power of man.|$|E
25|$|The video {{opens with}} Brandy giving her fictional boyfriend a watch. However, the couple starts to fight {{after a few}} seconds, leading Brandy to drive the boyfriend {{to the middle of}} a road and leaving him alone. She then changes her Facebook status to 'Single'. Next, we see Monica giving her lover a new car. The scene then cuts to both having a {{discussion}} on their room, that ends with Monica cutting her boyfriend's necktie with a pair of scissors. The singers are then seen together dressing black leather clothes in a bathroom. As they leave, they carry a MacBook, a golden box and a suit, while placing the items inside the car Monica had previously given her lover. As the lover watches both from afar, Monica and Brandy wave him goodbye. They leave on Brandy's car, as the other explodes in front of Monica's old house. The video ends with a dedication to Whitney Houston. Some of the video shows scenes of Brandy and Monica sitting the same way from Brandy's left and Monica's right with their chairs, Monica singing in the light with <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> black clothing and later a beret headband from the 70s, Brandy and Monica singing in their dress and signing behind the mirror with the light.|$|E
500|$|Only {{two days}} {{following}} the premiere, unlicensed copies appeared for sale in London. [...] "The rapid appearance of this film on the streets shows the sophistication and organisation behind film piracy in the UK," [...] said Kieron Sharp, from the Federation Against Copyright Theft. Infringing copies of the DVD were selling for less than £1.57. Craig himself was offered such a DVD while walking anonymously {{through the streets of}} Beijing wearing <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> glasses to avoid being identified.|$|E

500|$|Tourism {{developers}} have marketed Tana Toraja as an exotic adventure—an area rich in culture {{and off the}} beaten track. Western tourists expected to see stone-age villages and pagan funerals. Toraja is for tourists who have {{gone as far as}} Bali and are willing {{to see more of the}} wild, [...] "untouched" [...] islands. However, they were more likely to see a Torajan wearing <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> denim, living in a Christian society. Tourists felt that the tongkonan and other Torajan rituals had been preconceived to make profits, and complained that the destination was too commercialised. This has resulted in several clashes between Torajans and tourism developers, whom Torajans see as outsiders.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} numerous supporting roles from British actors. For {{her role}} as Andrea Waltham, Saunders [...] "heard Joan Collins' voice in [...] head". Her Absolutely Fabulous co-star June Whitfield appeared in cameo as the housekeeper. Felicity, the bridesmaid who Joey entices, is played by Olivia Williams. Further cameos were made by Sarah Ferguson as herself, Richard Branson as the vendor who sells Joey <b>a</b> <b>hat,</b> <b>and</b> Hugh Laurie as the man sitting next to Rachel on the plane. Lisa Kudrow did not join the others in London as she was too heavily pregnant to fly, like her character Phoebe. Elliott Gould inadvertently revealed {{to the public that}} Rachel was to turn up at the wedding, upsetting Marta Kauffman.|$|E
500|$|Marco's {{realization}} that Mulberry Street intersects with Bliss Street {{leads him to}} imagine a group of police escorts.

Now almost home, he snaps back to reality and rushes up the front steps, eager to tell his father his imagined story. However, when his father questions him about what he saw on his way home, his face turns red and he says, [...] "Nothing...but a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street." ...|$|E
