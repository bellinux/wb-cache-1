5|$|Historians have {{generally}} accepted McKean's version of events, {{arguing that the}} famous signed version of the Declaration was created after July 19, and was not signed by Congress until August 2, 1776. In 1986, legal historian Wilfred Ritz argued that historians had misunderstood the primary documents and given too much credence to McKean, {{who had not been}} present in Congress on July 4. According to Ritz, about thirty-four delegates signed the Declaration on July 4, and the others signed on or after August 2. Historians who reject a July 4 signing maintain that most delegates signed on August 2, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> eventual signers who were not present added their names later.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious {{asserts that}} there is a link between the {{international}} sex industry and legal prostitution in the Western world, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> who create the demand for forced prostitution around the world are {{of a wide variety of}} ages and are often considered respectable. The film contrasts the secretiveness and brutality of the sex industry in Eastern Europe with the openness of public prostitution in the Netherlands. Nefarious suggests that sex trafficking in Southeast Asia is fuelled largely by the complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia grooming and then knowingly selling their daughters into prostitution to pay for luxury goods. The film asserts that 10% of the population of Moldova has been sexually trafficked. Nefarious contrasts Las Vegas prostitutes with victims of sex trafficking in Europe, depicting the former as drawn into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by child abandonment and orphanages.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the final}} {{decision}} on {{the location of the}} new capital territory, the local landowners and residents of Queanbeyan looked favourably on the possibility of having the territory located nearby. Such a result, it was hoped, would bring improvements to local infrastructure, increase the demand for local goods and services, and raise land values.

5|$|There are {{a number}} of common threads found in criticisms of the flag of {{convenience}} system. One is that these flag states have insufficient regulations <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> regulations they do have are poorly enforced. Another is that, in many cases, the flag state cannot identify a shipowner, much less hold the owner civilly or criminally responsible for a ship's actions. As a result of this lack of flag state control, flags of convenience are criticized on grounds of providing an environment for conducting criminal activities, supporting terrorism, providing poor working conditions for seafarers, and having an adverse effect on the environment.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} witnesses, {{including}} Hannah Cox, {{testified to the}} events of the evening of 26 May and of the following morning. The first witnesses to attract significant cross-examination by William Reader, Thornton's barrister, were the two factory workers, William Lavell and Joseph Bird, who had matched Thornton's shoes to the footprints in the harrowed field. Under cross-examination, both admitted that it had rained heavily between the time the footprints were made and the time they attempted to match the prints. Constable Dales told the jury that Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched: that is, before his bloodstained clothing came to light. Mr Freer, a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post-mortem, testified as to its results, and stated that except for the vaginal lacerations, there were no signs of violence on Ashford's person, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> cuts could have been caused by consensual sexual relations. Freer's testimony concluded the prosecution case, and as the defendant declined to exercise his right to himself make a statement to the court, the defence began calling witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} collaborationist {{military}} and paramilitary units, the SDS was {{used against the}} Partisans operating within the occupied territory. In late 1941, prior {{to the formation of}} the SDS, the Serbian gendarmerie had participated in the German-led Operation Uzice, which drove the Partisans and Chetniks from the Užice area. The SDS routinely executed captured Partisans, and frequently took and murdered hostages in towns and villages. The SDS also included former members of the gendarmerie that had assisted German troops to round up hostages to be shot at both Kraljevo and Kragujevac in October 1941. In July 1941, the Banjica concentration camp had been established in the suburbs of Belgrade. It was initially guarded by both the Gestapo and the SDS, but sole responsibility was eventually transferred to the SDS, who behaved sadistically and violently towards the inmates. Survivors of the camp stated that executions at the camp were carried out by both the Belgrade Special Police and the SDS, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> executed included children. A total of 3,849 people were killed at the camp before it was closed on 3 October 1944. The SDS became increasingly unpopular with the population as time went on. Despite their limited independence, the SDS actively engaged in dehumanising Jews, Roma and communist Serbs, and in killing people from those groups or delivering them to the Germans for execution. They engaged in the execution of hostages both under Gestapo or Wehrmacht control and at their own initiative. The SDS clashed with other collaborationist formations at times, specifically Dimitrije Ljotić's Serbian Volunteer Corps (Srpski dobrovoljački korpus or SDK), and the Pećanac Chetniks loyal to vojvoda Kosta Pećanac.|$|E
5|$|The {{games were}} {{released}} in Japan on September 28, 2006. To commemorate the release, Nintendo sold a limited-edition DS Lite in Japanese Pokémon Center stores {{and through the}} Pokémon fan club by mail. The consoles featured the games' mascots Dialga and Palkia painted in silver and gold respectively on a metallic black finish. On December 20, 2006, Nintendo of America announced that the North American release of the games was slated for April 22, 2007, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> who pre-ordered their copies of the games would receive special DS styluses branded {{with some of the}} new Pokémon. Shortly before the games' North American release, The Pokémon Company presented a limited demo of the games for Nintendo's booth at the Game Developer's Conference. To celebrate the games' North American release, Nintendo held a release party at the Nintendo World Store in New York City's Rockefeller Plaza. Nintendo of Europe announced a release date of July 27, 2007, for the European Union, and Nintendo Australia announced a June 21 release date. A launch event was held in GAME stores at Hamleys to celebrate the European release of the games. The event, held on July 26, 2007, offered a chance to purchase the games one day before their official release date and featured an appearance by band McFly. To celebrate the Australian release of the games, Nintendo launched the nationwide Nintendo DS Connection Tour 07; each stop in the tour featured events such as Pokémon Trading Card Game competitions and Pokémon trivia games.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the effect of the learning models on learning achievement viewed from the personality type of the students. The learning models compared were the cooperative learning model of the TPS, LC 5 E, and the classical learning model with scientific approach. The type of the research was a quasi-experimental research. The instruments used were mathematics achievement test on the topic of function and questionnaire of personality type. The data was analyzed by using two way analysis of variance with unbalanced cells. The conclusions of the research were as follows. (1) The mathematic learning achievement of students treated with TPS learning model was as good as <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> treated with LC 5 E model, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> treated with TPS learning model was as good as <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> treated with classical learning model with scientific approach, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> treated with LC 5 E model was better than <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> treated with classical learning model with scientific approach; (2) The mathematic learning achievement of students with sanguine personality was better than <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> with melancholic one but was as good as <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> with choleric <b>and</b> phlegmatic personalities, <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> with choleric personality was better than <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> with melancholic one, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> with melancholic personality was as good as <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> with phlegmatic, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> with choleric personality was as good as <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> with phlegmatic one; (3) In each type of student personality, it could be found that the students treated with Think-Pair-Share had equally good learning achievement to those treated with LC 5 E model, the students treated with TPS had equally good learning achievement to those treated with classical learning model with scientific approach, those treated with LC 5 E model had better learning achievement than those treated with classical learning model with scientific approach; and (4) In each type of learning models, it could be found that the learning achievement of students with sanguine personality was better than <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> with melancholic one but was as good as <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> with choleric <b>and</b> phlegmatic personalities, <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> with choleric personality was better than <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> with melancholic one, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> with melancholic personality was as good as <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> with phlegmatic, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> with choleric personality was as good as <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> with phlegmatic one...|$|R

5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> who have much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E
