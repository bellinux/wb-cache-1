5|$|As {{described}} in attachment theory, infants {{need to develop}} a relationship with a primary caregiver to achieve normal social and emotional development. A key part of the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to language development, joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age. Anticipatory smiling (a low level form of joint attention involving smiling at an object then turning the smile to one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social competence scores at 30 months in infants. Early joint attention abilities account for differences in social and emotional abilities in later life.|$|E
5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E
5|$|The country became {{independent}} in 1977. Fédération Djiboutienne de Football {{was founded in}} 1977 and joined FIFA in 1994. Football {{is one of the}} most popular sports in the country. Women's football development in Africa has to deal with several challenges that impact the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> a high level of play, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When high level women's players are developed, many leave the country seeking greater opportunity in Northern Europe or the United States. Another issue facing women's football in Africa is that most of the money for the game does not come from national football federations but instead from FIFA.|$|E

5|$|A herbivorous species, Bagheera kiplingi, was {{described}} in 2008, but all other known species are predators, mostly preying on insects and on other spiders, although a few large species also take birds and lizards. It is estimated that the world's 25 million tons of spiders kill 400–800 million tons of prey per year. Spiders use {{a wide range of}} strategies to capture prey: trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down. Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision, and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> new ones. Spiders' guts are too narrow to take solids, and they liquefy their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes. They also grind food with the bases of their pedipalps, as arachnids do not have the mandibles that crustaceans and insects have.|$|E
5|$|The arcade game {{market is}} split into {{manufacturers}}, distributors, and operators; manufacturers like Atari sell game machines to distributors—who handle {{several types of}} electronic machines—who in turn sell them to the operators of locations. In the early 1970s, distributors bought games on an exclusive basis, meaning that only one distributor in each distribution region would carry products from a given arcade game manufacturer, restricting the manufacturer to only the operators that distributor sold to. Atari, in 1973 {{just over a year}} old and largely based on their hit first game Pong, felt that as a smaller manufacturer this setup severely limited their ability to sell arcade games: they could only contract with a limited number of distributors, who would only buy a limited number of games per year. To work around this, Atari set up a secret subsidiary company in September 1973, Kee Games, which was intended to sell clones of Atari's games, in effect doubling their potential reach. Kee did have its own manufacturing equipment and therefore the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> original titles, however, and after several clone games lead engineer Steve Bristow developed the idea for a new title. Bristow, who had previously worked with the Atari founders on Computer Space, the first arcade video game, {{came up with the idea}} while thinking of how he could improve Computer Space. His idea to correct the perceived shortcomings of the game were to replace its difficult to control rocket ships with more straightforward tanks, and to make it a two-player game instead of a single-player one.|$|E

25|$|A diesel–electric locomotive's {{power output}} is {{independent}} of road speed, {{as long as the}} unit's generator current and voltage limits are not exceeded. Therefore, the unit's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> tractive effort (also referred to as drawbar pull or tractive force, which is what actually propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable operating parameters was one of the principal design considerations that had to be solved in early diesel–electric locomotive development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.|$|E

Overall, low executive functioning seen in individuals with ADHD has been correlated with tendencies to overeat, as well as with emotional eating. This particular interest in the relationship between ADHD and obesity is rarely clinically assessed and may deserve more attention in future research.|$|E

25|$|Rabbi Gordon instituted various innovations, {{which were}} cause for a rapid {{increase}} in the student body. Among them were designating lectures for specific student levels. Whereas other contemporary yeshivas provided one level of study for all students, Telz provided students with lectures commensurate with a student's age and understanding. When a student's standard had advanced, he would advance to the next shiur (class-level). The benefits of such a system are self-explanatory and this system was soon integrated into the structure of almost all yeshivas and remains the accepted structure in most yeshivas worldwide. There were five different shiurim at Telz; Rabbi Gordon delivered the highest shiur. Telz was especially noted for its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> its talmidim in lomdus. Rabbi Laizer Yudel Finkel once stated that every talmud student would be best off studying at Telz, where he can develop his learning skills, for two years, and then studying in another yeshiva.|$|E

500|$|Levinson {{proposes that}} {{citizenship}} education {{can provide the}} [...] "cultural coherence" [...] that may be missing from a [...] "detached" [...] school—which would be a diverse community that prioritizes [...] "critical thinking, tolerance, and reflectiveness". She argues for a constitutional mandate to establish the [...] "autonomy-promoting aim of education" [...] regardless of public support, and asks for a [...] "culture change". Levinson distinguishes between parental and child rights, as laws exist for parents who do not act in their children's best interests. She adds that children are limited by the restricted scope of their parents' knowledge, and that the state should intervene to combat this small-mindedness {{in the interests of}} children. Specifically, she cites Christian criticism of curricular neutrality as a tactic to justify the imposition of their own [...] "limited and restrictive" [...] worldview, and that external knowledge increases the odds of their children not adopting their worldview. Her argument is that the limited worldviews resulting from [...] "excessive paternalism" [...] consequently stunt children's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> adult autonomy or make rational decisions. Thus, state and parental paternalism should be limited where it will hurt individual [...] "capacity for autonomy".|$|E
500|$|The RA615H {{was widely}} criticised by the wider Formula One community, with the team's struggles {{becoming}} {{a recurring theme}} throughout the 2015 season. This criticism was particularly directed at Honda's Project Manager Yasuhisa Arai and the rigidly compartmentalised structure between the two companies that saw Honda develop the engine independently of and with minimal input from McLaren, and their failure to recruit any engineers from rival engine manufacturers Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault, even after Arai's acknowledgement that Honda had underestimated {{the demands of the}} sport and the technology required to compete. Responding to the criticism, Arai claimed that the [...] "size zero" [...] approach demanded by McLaren—attempting to create a more compact design to fit the tight packaging of the MP4-30 chassis—had compromised the overall design of the engine and limited the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> it {{over the course of the}} season. Fernando Alonso defended the move, suggesting that Honda's independent development programme would make it difficult for other manufacturers to copy the RA615H's design. McLaren CEO Ron Dennis took a broader view, attributing the team's difficult season to a range of factors—including chassis development and staff morale—rather than the engine performance alone.|$|E
