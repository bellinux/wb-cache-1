40|$|To {{satisfy the}} needs of high energy gamma ray imagers for {{industrial}} nuclear imaging applications, three high energy gamma cameras are presented. The RMD-Pinhole camera uses a lead pinhole collimator and a segmented BGO detector viewed by a 3 in. square position sensitive photomultiplier tube (PSPMT). This pinhole gamma camera displayed <b>an</b> energy <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> 25. 0 % FWHM {{at the center of}} the camera at 662 keV and <b>an</b> angular <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> 6. 2 ” FWHM at 412 keV The fixed multiple hole collimated camera (FMCC), used a multiple hole collimator and a continuous slab of NaI(TI) detector viewed by the same PSPMT.

5|$|The {{second major}} {{instrument}} was the MKF-6M multispectral camera, which carried out Earth-resources observations. An improved {{form of a}} camera first tested on Soyuz 22, the camera captured an area of 165220kilometres with each image, down to <b>a</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> 20metres. Each image was captured simultaneously in six bands in 1200-frame cassettes, which required regular replacement due to the fogging effects of radiation.
