5000|$|The slope {{rating is}} the USGA mark that {{indicates}} {{the measurement of}} the relative difficulty for a bogey golfer compared to the course rating.

To compute the handicap strokes from a given set of tees on a specific course with a slope of [...] "s" [...] given <b>a</b> <b>handicap</b> <b>index</b> of [...] "h," [...] the following formula is used: (s/113)*h rounded to the nearest integer.NOTE: In the bogey formula calculation 5.381 is a set factor for men (4.24 for women) regardless of course rating etc..|$|E
50|$|There are no age {{or gender}} {{restrictions}} on entry, but players must have <b>a</b> <b>handicap</b> <b>index</b> of 2.4 or less.

The tournament consists of two days of stroke play, with the leading 64 competitors then playing a knockout competition held at match play to decide the champion. All knockout matches are over 18 holes except for the final, which consists of 36 holes, separated into morning and afternoon 18-hole rounds. Nowadays it is usually won by players in their late teens or early twenties who are working towards a career as a tournament professional. Before World War II more top-level golfers chose to remain amateur, and the average age of U.S. Amateur champions was higher.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate voice before and after thyroid surgery and the role of orotracheal intubation on voice changes. Methods. We conducted a prospective nonrandomized study of patients who underwent thyroid surgery and compared the results with a control group of patients who underwent breast surgery. Subjects underwent a videolaryngoscopic exam, a sub-jective and an objective voice analysis and <b>a</b> Voice <b>Handicap</b> <b>Index</b> (VHI) questionnaire before and after surgery. Results. A total of 100 patients who underwent thyroidec-tomy and 30 who underwent breast surgery were studied. Both groups were similar in demographic, clinical, and surgical varia-bles.

40|$|Introduction Disordered {{voice quality}} {{could be a}} symptom of {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS). The impact of MS on voice-related {{quality of life is}} still controversial.

Methods The research included 38 patients with relapse-remitting MS (23 women and 15 men; ages 21 to 83, mean[*]=[*] 44). All participants filled out <b>a</b> Voice <b>Handicap</b> <b>Index</b> (VHI), and their voice sample was analyzed by speech and language professionals using the Grade Roughness Breathiness Asthenia Strain scale (GRBAS). Results The patients with MS had significantly higher VHI than control group participants (mean value 16. 68 [*]±[*] 16. 2 compared with 5. 29 [*]±[*] 5. 5, p[*]=[*] 0. 0001). The study established a notable level of dysphonia in 55...|$|R
5000|$|This {{programme}} provides {{children between}} the ages of 6-12 with the opportunity to try golf at their local schools through an introductory training system called ShortGolf. The primary goal of the programme is to introduce golf to primary school students across Hong Kong, and to make the sport more accessible by providing children the opportunity to be exposed to golf. The programme also provides basic-level golf instruction to teachers so that they will be able to continue lessons independently. The program has seen great support. In 2014 at the Hong Kong Open, golfing professionals Robert-Jan Derksen and Liang Wen-Chong ran a seminar open to the public for all four-tournament days. [...] The program concludes with on-course golf lessons, and the opportunity to earn <b>an</b> official HKGA <b>handicap</b> <b>index.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Additionally, {{before making}} the above calculation, the gross score must be {{adjusted}} using the equitable score control table, which removes the effect of abnormally high individual hole scores by establishing a maximum score per hole depending on the player's <b>handicap</b> <b>index.</b> For example, <b>a</b> golfer with <b>a</b> course <b>handicap</b> of 20 through 29 can record a maximum of 8 strokes on any one hole for handicap calculation purposes only.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to verify a {{statistical}} validity of the Slovenian version of <b>a</b> Voice <b>Handicap</b> <b>Index</b> questionnaire for <b>a</b> possible use in practice. The questionnaire was filled in by 100 patients with voice disorders and 100 people without any voice problems. Internal consistency was verified with Cronbach Alpha coefficients. Correlation between individual items and the overall VHI result of a control group was carried out with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The validity was checked by comparing overall VHI results {{and the results of}} individual subtests of people with dysphonia and a control group with a non-parametric test (the Kruskal-Wallis test). The impact of gender, age and a type of voice disorder on an overall VHI result and on a result of individual subtests was calculated with the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and the nonparametric test (the Kruskal-Wallis test). The internal consistency of the questionnaire was good (Cronbach Alpha = 0. 90). According to the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis, the results of a control group are significantly lower than the results of a dysphonic group. In a group of people with voice disorders gender, the type of a voice disorder and age do not influence the VHI result, only a functional subtest shows minor age dependency. Therefore, it can be concluded that the test was translated properly, reliably and is valid, and can therefore be used for Slovenian speaking population...|$|R
