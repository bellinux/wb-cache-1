5|$|On the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{attorney}} Percy Foreman, Ray {{pleaded guilty}} to avoid a trial conviction and thus the possibility of receiving the death penalty. He was sentenced to a 99-year prison term.|$|E
5|$|By February, the Germans were in full retreat. On February 23, 1945, the U.S. 94th Infantry Division {{crossed the}} Saar and {{established}} a vital bridgehead at Serrig through which Patton pushed units into the Saarland. Patton had insisted upon an immediate crossing of the Saar River against the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> officers. Historians such as Charles Whiting have criticized this strategy as unnecessarily aggressive.|$|E
5|$|During the Chancellery project, the pogrom of Kristallnacht took place. Speer made {{no mention}} of it in the first draft of Inside the Third Reich, and it was only on the urgent <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{publisher}} that he added a mention of seeing the ruins of the Central Synagogue in Berlin from his car.|$|E
5000|$|Dilawan (voiced over by Noel Urbano) - An elderly Adamyan {{among the}} Punjabwes. Azulan {{turns to him}} for <b>advice</b> because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wisdom and experience.|$|R
5000|$|The film premiered at the World Cinema in Copenhagen on November 13, 1943. Dreyer always {{denied the}} film as being {{analogous}} to persecution of Jews. However, on the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friends he left Denmark on the pretext of selling Day of Wrath in foreign markets and {{spent the rest of}} the war in Sweden shortly after the film's release.|$|R
50|$|He {{is survived}} by his adopted son Mohammad Saburi, who met Azar Yazdi in 1949. Mohammad had been {{referred}} for employment to a photography house in Yazd where Azar Yazdi used to work. Azar Yazdi was leaving the store when he came upon the eight-year-old Mohammad weeping after having been rejected by the owner of the business. He adopted him on the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friends.|$|R
5|$|Edward {{informed}} Baldwin that {{he would}} abdicate {{if he could not}} marry Simpson. Baldwin then presented Edward with three choices: give up the idea of marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate. It was clear that Edward was not prepared to give up Simpson, and he knew that if he married against the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis. He chose to abdicate.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> older brother, Breckinridge {{obtained}} his law license on January 3, 1824, but {{the practice}} of law did not suit him. He instead decided to follow the family tradition and seek public office, campaigning for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives. Even in his early political career, he began to articulate his stance on the issues that would become his legacy.|$|E
5|$|Here, Brock met Tecumseh, and was {{immediately}} impressed. Brock also read American dispatches captured from Hull's army. He quickly judged Hull to be timid and afraid of the First Nations in particular, and the American force to be demoralised and short of rations. Against the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> officers, Brock immediately prepared to launch an attack on Detroit.|$|E
50|$|Moving forward, the 94th Infantry Division and the 10th Armored Division {{secured the}} area from Orscholz and Saarburg to the {{confluence}} of the Saar and Moselle Rivers by 21 February 1945. At Ayl General Patton ordered to cross the Saar immediately, against the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> officers. Under command of Lieutenant Colonel William A. McNulty, the 94th's 3rd Battalion crossed the icy and swollen Saar on February 23, 1945.|$|R
50|$|The {{son of a}} Brooklyn button manufacturer, Lembeck {{yearned for}} {{a career as a}} radio sports announcer. Following his {{discharge}} from the United States Army at the end of World War II in 1945, he attended New York University, obtaining a degree in radio arts in 1947. However, he chose the stage as a career upon the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> instructors, Prof. Robert Emerson, who had seen him perform in college plays.|$|R
50|$|Wendig has run {{his blog}} Terribleminds since 2000, where he {{dispenses}} regular writing <b>advice.</b> Much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> writing <b>advice</b> has been collected in his self-published e-books or his book The Kickass Writer, published in 2013 by Writer's Digest Books.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the many}} factors in his success was Como's insistence on his {{principles}} of good taste; if he considered something to be in bad or questionable taste, {{it was not in}} the show or broadcast. When a remark made by Julius La Rosa about television personality Arthur Godfrey on The Perry Como Show was misconstrued, Como offered an on-air apology {{at the beginning of his}} next show, against the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> staff.|$|E
5|$|Under modern {{constitutional}} conventions, {{the sovereign}} acts on the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> or her ministers. Since these ministers most often enjoy {{the support of}} parliament and obtain the passage of bills, it is improbable that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent. Hence, in modern practice, royal assent is always granted; a refusal {{to do so would}} be appropriate only in an emergency requiring the use of the monarch's reserve powers.|$|E
5|$|When he {{was made}} aware of the new deal, Waylon was not sure if he should quit his gig at JD's. He then went to get the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friend, RCA artist Willie Nelson, who had gone to see one of Waylon's shows. When Willie and Waylon met, after talking about the {{possibilities}} and considering Waylon's profits at the club, Nelson suggested that Waylon should stay in Phoenix and not to move to Nashville.|$|E
50|$|On 7 January 2007, {{he moved}} to Halmstads BK to play in Allsvenskan, on the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> both <b>his</b> father and former Halmstads BK player Michael Svensson. On 1 May 2008, he was loaned out to Vaasan Palloseura after {{suffering}} illness {{as well as a}} lack of playing time with Halmstads.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{after graduating}} {{secondary}} school, Foujita wished {{to study in}} France, but on the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> Mori Ōgai (<b>his</b> father's senpai military physician) he decided to study western art in Japan first.|$|R
25|$|There was no news of {{the arrival}} of the Portuguese galleons, but against the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> subordinates, Governor de Silva sailed for Malacca on February 9, 1616. He {{commanded}} ten galleons, four galleys and various smaller vessels. The flagship was the 1,700-ton San Marcos. The fleet carried 5,000 men, both soldiers and sailors, including nearly 2,000 Spaniards and a unit of Japanese infantry, which numbered at 500. It also carried 300 artillery pieces and 6 Jesuits. It was the largest European armada yet seen in the region.|$|R
5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, though it would keep him out for an extended period. However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was able to start running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} William experienced, he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral. He abolished the cat o' nine tails for most offences other than mutiny, attempted {{to improve the}} standard of naval gunnery and required regular reports of the condition and preparedness of each ship. He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated more. Holding the office permitted him to make mistakes and learn from them—a process {{that might have been}} far more costly if he had not learnt before becoming King that he should act only with the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> councillors.|$|E
5|$|From the 18th century, the Sovereign {{made his}} or her choices {{on the advice of}} the Government. In 1946, with the {{agreement}} of the Prime Minister Clement Attlee and the Leader of the Opposition Winston Churchill, membership of the United Kingdom's highest ranking orders of chivalry (the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle and the dormant Order of St. Patrick) became a personal gift of the Sovereign once again. Thus, the Sovereign personally selects Knights and Ladies Companion of the Garter, and need not act on or solicit the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> or Her Government.|$|E
50|$|But by {{this time}} the Mughals were no longer the army they were earlier feared to be. Aurangzeb, against the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{experienced}} generals, continued the war. Aurangzeb's position was much like that of Alexander on the borders of Taxila.|$|R
50|$|Andrews early {{undertook}} original scientific research, {{with the}} practical <b>advice</b> and guidance <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father, {{who died in}} 1871. He then became head at Wortley.|$|R
5000|$|From the mid-1960s, {{engineers}} (John) Phil Ray and Austin O. [...] "Gus" [...] Roche {{were working}} for General Dynamics Dynatronic Division in Florida, {{as part of a}} computing contract team for NASA to enable President John F. Kennedy's vision of putting a man on the moon. At the time, mainframe computers were large room-filling pieces of equipment, for which data was input using dumb and noisy Teletype terminals. On the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tutors from the University of Texas, Ray and Roche decided to develop a quieter and smaller input device based on using a television set screen.|$|R
5|$|In 1844, Breckinridge's wife Ann died. Lingering {{sadness and}} {{memories}} of his and Ann's life in Baltimore may have led {{him to leave the}} city and the pastorate he had held for twelve years. He was offered pastorate of the Second Presbyterian Church of Lexington, Kentucky, but instead, accepted the presidency of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1845 against the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brothers John and William. A rift between Breckinridge and his brother Cabell's widow and other relatives may help account for this surprising decision. He did not feel he could yet return to his home state.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Henderson {{graduated}} from Oakland Technical High School, {{where he played}} baseball, basketball and football, and was an All-American running back {{with a pair of}} 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He also ran track, but did not stay with the team as the schedule conflicted with baseball. Henderson received over a dozen scholarship offers to play football. Despite a childhood dream to play for the Oakland Raiders, he turned down the scholarships on the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother, who argued that football players had shorter careers. In 1983, Henderson married his high-school sweetheart, Pamela. They have three children: Angela, Alexis, and Adrianna.|$|E
5|$|In February 1938, on the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> newly {{appointed}} foreign minister, the strongly pro-Japanese Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler ended the Sino-German {{alliance with the}} Republic of China to instead enter into an alliance with the more modern and powerful Empire of Japan. Hitler announced German recognition of Manchukuo, the Japanese-occupied state in Manchuria, and renounced German claims to their former colonies in the Pacific held by Japan. Hitler ordered an end to arms shipments to China and recalled all German officers working with the Chinese Army. In retaliation, Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek cancelled all Sino-German economic agreements, depriving the Germans of many Chinese raw materials.|$|E
50|$|In the 1940s, in a Mexican {{mining town}} lives María de la Canela, nicknamed Marianela. This dirty and ragged orphan is despised by villagers who see it {{inherited}} traits madness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother committed suicide by jumping off a ravine. Is that where Marianela goes in search <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> ghost <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother. The only loving {{being with the}} beggar is Pablo, a rich guy but blind Marianela who served as guide.|$|R
50|$|Nayan has a {{bedridden}} {{father and}} two elder sisters {{waiting to get}} married. He is the most sober and also a tee-to-teller among the four. He always gives his friends useful <b>advice</b> despite <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own household problems. When his father dies, Nayan leaves home to work with an uncle in a distant township.|$|R
50|$|Mamachi was a zealous {{supporter}} {{of the power of}} the Roman Pontiff. Involved in all the controversy of the day, he was one of the first to take issue with Johannes Nicolaus Von Hontheim (Febronius). Pius VI made him secretary of the Index (1779) and afterwards Master of the Sacred Palace, and frequently availed himself <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>advice</b> and <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pen.|$|R
5|$|In February 2007, Wotton {{was granted}} a {{separate}} trial from his co-accused in the Brisbane District Court since the allegations in the prosecution case against the other co-accused were prejudicial to Wotton's case. Wotton then pleaded guilty {{to the charge of}} rioting. In late March, after Wotton had already applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> legal representatives (including his then barrister Marcus Einfeld), Wotton's co-accused were acquitted by a jury of rioting causing destruction. Wotton's application to withdraw his plea was granted by Nase DCJ on 26 April 2007. A few days later, Wotton was released on bail with strict conditions and ordered to return in April 2008 to be tried.|$|E
5|$|In Han government, {{the emperor}} was the supreme judge and lawgiver, the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the armed}} forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations; those who earned a 600-bushel salary-rank or higher. Theoretically, there were no limits to his power. However, state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference (tingyi 廷議)—where ministers were convened to reach majority consensus on an issue—pressured the emperor to accept the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ministers on policy decisions. If the emperor rejected a court conference decision, he risked alienating his high ministers. Nevertheless, emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1857, FitzGerald {{resigned}} from Parliament on the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> doctors, and also {{decided not to}} seek re-election as provincial Superintendent. Robert Heaton Rhodes offered a requisition to Brittan to make himself available for the by-election that would result from FitzGerald's resignation from Parliament in the Lyttelton electorate, but Brittan replied {{that he could not}} absent himself from his private affairs as yet; Parliament at that time met in Auckland, and the 1858 session lasted from 10 April to 21 August, which required an absence from home for several months. Instead, Crosbie Ward, the editor and proprietor of the Lyttelton Times, was the only person nominated on 28 May 1858 and was thus declared elected.|$|E
50|$|But Gen. John J. Pershing, Commander in Chief, American Expeditionary Forces (AEF), {{requested}} in September 1917 that 600 {{heavy and}} 1,200 light tanks {{be produced in}} the United States. When General Pershing assumed command of the American Expeditionary Force and went to France, he took Lt. Col. George Patton. Patton became interested in tanks. They were then unwieldy, unreliable, and unproved instruments of warfare, and there was much doubt whether they had any function and value {{at all on the}} battlefield. Against the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friends, Patton chose to go into the newly formed US Tank Corps. He was the first officer so assigned.|$|R
5000|$|On the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{colleagues in}} Guelph, he {{audition}}ed {{to work at}} the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). After his audition was over, Robertson thought, [...] "I'm never going to see this building again." [...] Despite this, he got hired by the CBC, thanks to his rich baritone voice.|$|R
50|$|In the story, Miss Lonelyhearts is {{an unnamed}} male {{newspaper}} columnist writing an advice column that the newspaper staff considers a joke. As Miss Lonelyhearts reads letters from desperate New Yorkers, he feels terribly burdened and {{falls into a}} cycle of deep depression, accompanied by heavy drinking and occasional bar fights. He is also {{the victim of the}} pranks and cynical <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> Shrike, <b>his</b> feature editor at the newspaper.|$|R
