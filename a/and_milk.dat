5|$|Milk's {{early career}} {{was marked by}} {{frequent}} changes; in later years he would take delight in talking about his metamorphosis from a middle-class Jewish boy. He began teaching at George W. Hewlett High School on Long Island. In 1956, he met Joe Campbell, at the Jacob Riis Park beach, a popular location for gay men in Queens. Campbell was seven years younger than Milk, <b>and</b> <b>Milk</b> pursued him passionately. Even after they moved in together, Milk wrote Campbell romantic notes and poems. Growing bored with their New York lives, they {{decided to move to}} Dallas, Texas, but they were unhappy there and moved back to New York, where Milk got a job as an actuarial statistician at an insurance firm. Campbell <b>and</b> <b>Milk</b> separated after almost six years; it would be his longest relationship.|$|E

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Abstract: A high milk production, time limited <b>milking</b> <b>and</b> healthy udders are priority tasks at milking farms. The aim of {{our research}} was to study how different ways of keeping (free rang <b>and</b> tying) <b>and</b> <b>milking</b> (milking parlour, bucket machine <b>and</b> pipeline <b>milking)</b> influence on the mentioned cattle characteristics. Investigation was conducted at four <b>milking</b> farms <b>and</b> 382 Holstein cows in eastern Croatia. The variance analysis has shown significant difference (P< 0, 05) among researched farms for the milk yield per milking (MYM), the somatic cell count (LSCC) <b>and</b> the maximum <b>milk</b> flowing rate (MFR). Farms at which cows were kept <b>and</b> <b>milked</b> bound up in stables had more problems with udder health than farms at which milking was conducted at milking places. Also at these farms (at which cows were kept <b>and</b> <b>milked</b> bound up in stables) the maximum milk flowing rate was uneven, what was caused by uneven vacuum <b>and</b> obsoletes <b>milking</b> equipment. Keeping cows free at the stable <b>and</b> <b>milking</b> at a milking place have appeared to be more appropriate for cow’s udder health, what finally influences a higher milking production. Such farms should be the future of modern milking production in Croatia. Key words: milk yield, somatic cell count, milk flowing rate, milking metho...|$|R

5|$|Britain was {{the world}} leader in the {{construction}} of railways, and their use to expand trade and coal supplies. The first successful locomotive-powered line in Scotland, between Monkland and Kirkintilloch, opened in 1831. Not only was good passenger service established by the late 1840s, but an excellent network of freight lines reduce the cost of shipping coal, and made products manufactured in Scotland competitive throughout Britain. For example, railways opened the London market to Scottish beef <b>and</b> <b>milk.</b> They enabled the Aberdeen Angus to become a cattle breed of worldwide reputation.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} century in the Netherlands milk {{production}} per cow has almost tripled. Accordingly, the amount of concentrates yearly fed per cow strongly increased. Furthermore, automation and robotisation has changed dairy management, especially {{by the introduction of}} automatic concentrate feeders <b>and</b> <b>milking</b> systems. A new management concept, emerging in the last decades, is Precision Livestock Farming (PLF). The objective of PLF is to optimize livestock production, by on-line monitoring and control of the production process, utilizing the technical possibilities of automation and robotisation. Nowadays, individual settings for daily concentrate supply <b>and</b> <b>milking</b> frequency are based on standards, ignoring individual variation in milk yield response on concentrate intake <b>and</b> <b>milking</b> frequency. This leads to the main hypothesis for this thesis research that profitability of dairy farming can be improved by utilizing information on individual variation in response. The first objective of this research was to quantify the individual variation in milk yield response to concentrate intake <b>and</b> <b>milking</b> interval length, in order to assess the economic prospects of applying individual optimal settings for concentrate supply <b>and</b> <b>milking</b> frequency. The second objective was the development and testing of adaptive models for on-line estimation of the actual individual response in milk yield to concentrate intake <b>and</b> <b>milking</b> interval length. The conclusion is that on-line estimation of the actual individual response in <b>milk</b> yield <b>and</b> <b>milking</b> duration is possible following a Bayesian approach for time series using an adaptive dynamic model. Besides estimation of the actual response the Bayesian approach adequately detects process deteriorations. Therefore, adaptive dynamic models provide a useful tool for control and monitoring of the dairy production process...|$|R
