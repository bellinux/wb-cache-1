5|$|The male of the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{which is}} found {{throughout most of}} Europe, is all black except for a yellow eye-ring and bill and has a rich, melodious song; the adult female and juvenile have mainly dark brown plumage. This species breeds in woods and gardens, building <b>a</b> <b>neat,</b> mud-lined, cup-shaped nest. It is omnivorous, eating {{a wide range of}} insects, earthworms, berries, and fruits.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 Pei's group took a {{step toward}} {{institutional}} independence from Webb and Knapp by establishing a new firm called I.M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I.M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom to work with other companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed architectural models. They took on the Kips Bay residential area {{on the east side of}} Manhattan, where Pei set up Kips Bay Towers, two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of concrete to check for consistency of color.|$|E
5|$|Large crowds {{started to}} gather {{early in the}} day {{including}} many people who had travelled to Bristol to see the spectacle. There was a general atmosphere of anticipation as the Royal Emblem was unfurled. The processional route had been cleaned and Temple Street decorated with flags, banners, flowers and ribbons. Boys of the City School and girls of Red Maids were stationed in <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> orderly formation down {{the entire length of the}} Exchange. The route was a mass of colour and everybody was out on the streets as it was a public holiday. The atmosphere of gaiety even allowed thoughts to drift away from the problems of political dissension in London.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{blackcap}} (Sylvia atricapilla) usually known {{simply as}} the blackcap, is a common and widespread typical warbler. It has mainly olive-grey upperparts and pale grey underparts, and differences between the five subspecies are small. Both sexes have <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> coloured cap to the head, black in the male and reddish-brown in the female. The male's typical song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas, such as valleys in the Alps. The blackcap's closest relative is the garden warbler, which looks quite different but has a similar song.|$|E
5|$|The site of Pickett's Charge {{is one of}} the best-maintained {{portions}} of the Gettysburg Battlefield. Despite millions of annual visitors to Gettysburg National Military Park, very few have walked in the footsteps of Pickett's division. The National Park Service maintains <b>a</b> <b>neat,</b> mowed path alongside a fence that leads from the Virginia Monument on West Confederate Avenue (Seminary Ridge) due east to the Emmitsburg Road {{in the direction of the}} Copse of Trees. Pickett's division, however, started considerably south of that point, near the Spangler farm, and wheeled to the north after crossing the road. In fact, the Park Service pathway stands between the two main thrusts of Longstreet's assault—Trimble's division advanced north of the current path, while Pickett's division moved from farther south.|$|E
5|$|This martin nests under a cliff {{overhang}} or on {{a man-made}} structure, building <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> half-cup mud nest {{with a soft}} lining. Both adults incubate the two to four eggs and feed the chicks. This species does not form large breeding colonies, {{but it is more}} gregarious outside the breeding season. It feeds a wide variety of insects that are caught as the martin flies near to cliff faces. It may be hunted by large bats as well as birds of prey, but its extensive and expanding range and large population mean that there are no significant conservation concerns.|$|E

5|$|The {{blackcap}} breeds {{in much of}} Europe, western Asia and northwestern Africa, and its preferred {{habitat is}} mature deciduous woodland. The male holds a territory when breeding, which is defended against garden warblers {{as well as other}} blackcaps. The nest is <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> cup, built low in brambles or scrub, and the clutch is typically 4–6 mainly buff eggs, which hatch in about 11days. The chicks fledge in 11–12days, but are cared for by both adults for some time after leaving the nest. The blackcap is a partial migrant; birds from the colder areas of its range winter in scrub or trees in northwestern Europe, around the Mediterranean and in tropical Africa. Some German birds have adapted to spending the winter in gardens in Great Britain and Ireland. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, but, {{for the rest of the}} year, blackcaps survive primarily on small fruit. Garden birds also eat bread, fat and peanuts in winter.|$|E
5|$|The female {{song thrush}} builds <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> {{cup-shaped}} nest lined with mud and dry grass in a bush, tree or creeper, or, {{in the case}} of the Hebridean subspecies, on the ground. She lays four or five bright glossy blue eggs which are lightly spotted with black or purple; they are typically 2.7x2.0 centimetres (0.79x1.06in) in size and weigh 6.0grammes (0.21oz), of which 6% is shell. The female incubates the eggs alone for 10–17days, and after hatching a similar time elapses until the young fledge. Two or three broods in a year is normal, although only one may be raised in the north of the range. On average, 54.6% of British juveniles survive the first year of life, and the adult annual survival rate is 62.2%. The typical lifespan is three years, but the maximum recorded age is 10years 8months.|$|E
5|$|The masked shrike's {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} open woodland with bushes and some large trees. It is less conspicuous than its relatives, avoiding very open country and often perching in less exposed locations. The nest is <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> cup {{built in a}} tree by both adults, and the clutch is normally 4–6 eggs, which are incubated by the female for 14–16 days until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents until they fledge 18–20days later, and remain dependent on the adults for about 3–4 weeks after leaving the nest. The masked shrike eats mainly large insects, occasionally small vertebrates; it sometimes impales its prey on thorns or barbed wire. Populations are decreasing {{in parts of the}} European range, but not rapidly enough to raise serious conservation concerns, and the species is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E

5|$|This martin {{builds a}} deep bowl nest on a {{sheltered}} horizontal surface, or <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> quarter-sphere against a vertical rock face or wall. The nest is constructed with mud pellets and lined with grass or feathers, {{and may be}} built on natural sites under cliff overhangs or on man-made structures such as buildings and bridges. It is often reused for subsequent broods or in later years. This species is often a solitary breeder, but small groups may breed close together in suitable locations. The two or three eggs of a typical clutch are white with brown and grey blotches, and are incubated by both adults for 16–19 days prior to hatching. Both parents then feed the chicks. Fledging takes another 22–24 days, although the young birds {{will return to the}} nest to roost for {{a few days after the}} first flight.|$|E
5|$|Nani {{began the}} new season by putting in {{a man of the}} match {{performance}} and scoring twice against derby rivals Manchester City in the 2011 Community Shield, including a 94th-minute winner, as United came from two goals down to win 3–2 on 7 August 2011. He scored his first league goal of the 2011–12 season by netting United's fifth goal in an 8–2 victory over Arsenal on 28 August. Nani made his 100th Premier League appearance on 18 September as he scored in a 3–1 home win over Chelsea. He scored with a long-range strike after cutting inside from the right wing. He was also awarded with the man of the match. In United's following league match at the Britannia Stadium, Nani scored his third goal of the season in a 1–1 draw with Stoke City. He played <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> one-two with Darren Fletcher before making his way through Stoke's defence and firing a low shot inside the left post. Nani started the match against Manchester City where they fell victim to a 1–6 beating at home to their neighbours. On 1 November, Nani was shortlisted for the prestigious FIFA Ballon d'Or.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season takes place over five months from August to January {{with up to}} three broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites to the female by rubbing his body over a suitable tree fork, all the while trilling continuously. He may indicate several sites before the female ultimately makes the decision where to build, at which point she constructs the nest alone. The nest is <b>a</b> <b>neat,</b> deep cup made of soft dry grass and bark. Spider webs, feathers and fur are used for binding or filling, and the nest is generally placed in a tree fork or even a mistletoe bush. It may be decorated with lichen and camouflaged {{to blend in with}} its surroundings. Two to three dull white eggs tinted bluish, greyish or brownish and splotched with dark grey-brown are laid on consecutive days, measuring 16mm × 13mm (0.6 × 0.5in). Females alone develop brood patches and incubate, although both sexes feed the young. The male will keep lookout either on the nest or perched on a nearby branch, rather than brood while the female is foraging, and parents will feed young and dart off quickly if there are predators in the vicinity. Extra-pair mating and fertilisation is fairly common, with 23% of nestlings and 37% of broods having a different father to the one rearing them, and {{there is some evidence that}} extra-pair couplings are more likely to produce male birds.|$|E

5|$|Wilson {{played in}} Stevenage's first fixture of the 2010–11 season, playing 72 {{minutes in the}} club's 2–2 draw with Macclesfield Town. In September 2010, he was sent-off {{in a game against}} Cheltenham Town at Whaddon Road, {{receiving}} a red card for two bookable offences. He subsequently missed Stevenage's 0–0 draw against Torquay United {{as a result of the}} suspension. Shortly after, he signed a new contract with the club, keeping him at Stevenage until 2012. He returned to the first-team in Stevenage's win against Lincoln City, and provided two assists in Stevenage's 4–1 win away at Hereford United three days later. Wilson's fine form continued, as he was on hand to assist both of Stevenage's goals in a 2–1 win over Burton Albion – firstly being fouled in the area to earn Stevenage a penalty, and secondly crossing the ball into the box for Chris Holroyd to volley home. He scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season in Stevenage's 2–2 draw against Accrington Stanley in February 2011. A month later, Wilson scored both of Stevenage's goals in a 2–1 home win against Lincoln City, his second goal coming from 25 yards out after <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> interchange with John Mousinho. He scored his fourth goal of the season on 9 April, netting an injury-time equaliser in a 2–2 draw at Stockport County. Wilson scored his fifth goal of the season on 25 April, scoring the only goal of the game in Stevenage's 1–0 home win against Port Vale. He scored five goals in 50 appearances during the club's 2010–11 campaign, a season that witnessed Stevenage earn promotion to League One for the first time in their history.|$|E
