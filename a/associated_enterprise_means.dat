40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} the tax {{consequences}} of transfer pricing between <b>associated</b> <b>enterprises</b> in cross-border transactions. The income adjustment made in only one country can result in international economic double taxation of the transferred part of income, that is both {{at the level of}} enterprise whom the income has been attributed to and {{at the level of the}} <b>associated</b> <b>enterprise.</b> The risk of double taxation is essentially lowered, although not always eliminated, in transactions between <b>associated</b> <b>enterprises</b> from EU Member States, for the possibility of the corresponding adjustment to income in the other country where the transferred income had been actually taxed...|$|R

40|$|Enterprises when {{transacting}} {{with each}} other, are not {{subjected to the}} same market forces as independent enterprises. From a Swedish perspective the applicable rule to transactions between <b>associated</b> <b>enterprises</b> is chap. 14 para. 19. Both the Swedish arm’s length rule and its international equivalence are abstract rules of law as they merely provides the legal ramification if <b>associated</b> <b>enterprises</b> interact {{in a manner that}} independent enterprises would not. The international equivalence to the Swedish arm’s length rule is not a separate rule of law per se it is the gateway by which the Swedish rule is made applicable in international situations, {{through the use of a}} double tax agreement, with the fundamental principle that a double tax agreement can only limit, never expand a countries right to tax. The OECD Guidelines governing the general aspects of transfer pricing states that the fundamental meaning of the Guidelines is to find ways of establishing a price used between <b>associated</b> <b>enterprises</b> that are similar to what independent enterprise would conclude. The first step towards finding such a price is though the comparability analyses were all the relevant characteristics of the transferred goods is analysed. The chapter in the Guidelines that governs business restructurings is meant to be applied alongside the general aspects of transfer pricing. The Guidelines proposed way of finding an appropriate price for the transaction of a branch of production with respect to profit potential is with special consideration to risks. The profit potential is irrevocably linked with the risks transferred since it is a presumption that with increased risk there is a potential for higher profits. Although the risks are the most important aspect there are other things to look at such as other options realistically available and benefits from concluding a business restructuring. ...|$|R

Social Constructionists believe that knowledge is not discovered; it is constructed by the subjective reality of everyday life (Berger & Luckmann 1991; Andrews 2012). Reality is constructed not from within a person but from social realm (Burr 1995). An organization is a society itself which changes, evolves, sustains, through interpersonal interactions (Kemeny 2002). Social constructionists {{do not believe in}} biological reductionism (i.e. human behavior is a result of underlying natural essence).|$|R

And the reasonable weight is given by synthesizing evaluation results of three angles, to get the comprehensive evaluation result. Then reasonable proposals are proposed for the enterprise based on the assessment results, which make the enterprise adjust energy-using behavior, to reduce the energy consumption and save electricity, and finally to provide decision-making basis for enterprise demand side response, saving energy and reducing consumption...|$|R
