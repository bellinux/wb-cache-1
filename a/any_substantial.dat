5|$|A {{draft design}} was {{completed}} without foreign assistance by the Construction Department on 11 July 1939, {{but it did}} not reflect the numerous technical developments that had entered capital ship designs after the First World War. In particular, its armor scheme was utterly obsolete, as it lacked <b>any</b> <b>substantial</b> amount of deck armor or good underwater protection; it came closer to the designs of 20 to 25years previous than to that of a modern warship.|$|E
5|$|Mi defensa, 1843. This was Sarmiento's first {{autobiography}} in {{a pamphlet}} form, which omits <b>any</b> <b>substantial</b> information or {{recognition of his}} illegitimate daughter Ana. This would have discredited Sarmiento as a respected father of Argentina, as Sarmiento portrays himself as a sole individual, disregarding or denouncing important ties to other people and groups in his life.|$|E
5|$|On December 18, a hundred-member Citizens' Committee (Komitet Obywatelski) {{was formed}} within Solidarity. It {{comprised}} several sections, each responsible for presenting a specific aspect of opposition demands to the government. Wałęsa {{and the majority}} of Solidarity leaders supported negotiation, while a minority wanted an anticommunist revolution. Under Wałęsa's leadership, Solidarity decided to pursue a peaceful solution, and the pro-violence faction never attained <b>any</b> <b>substantial</b> power, nor did it take any action.|$|E

50|$|The {{church was}} {{designed}} by C. E. Lang. Building began in 1845 in what was the developing dock area of Birkenhead before there was <b>any</b> other <b>substantial</b> building nearby. For some years it remained unfinished, until it was completed in 1858 by Walter Scott.|$|R

5|$|The Thirty Years' War period {{brought the}} Commonwealth a mixed legacy, rather more losses than gains, with the Polish–Lithuanian state {{retaining}} {{its status as}} one of the few great powers in central-eastern Europe. From 1635 the country enjoyed a period of peace, during which internal bickering and progressively dysfunctional legislative processes prevented <b>any</b> <b>substantial</b> reforms from taking place. The Commonwealth was unprepared to deal with grave challenges that materialized in the middle of the century.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} central bank {{interventions}} on the US dollar and Deutsche mark found only limited evidence of <b>any</b> <b>substantial</b> effect on deviations from UIRP. UIRP {{has been found}} to hold over very small spans of time (covering only a number of hours) with a high frequency of bilateral exchange rate data. Tests of UIRP for economies experiencing institutional regime changes, using monthly exchange rate data for the US dollar versus the Deutsche mark and the Spanish peseta versus the British pound, have found some evidence that UIRP held when US and German regime changes were volatile, and held between Spain and the United Kingdom particularly after Spain joined the European Union in 1986 and began liberalizing capital mobility.|$|E
5|$|According to Plutarch, an army under Parmenion {{defeated}} the Illyrian king Grabos in 356 BC, {{shortly after the}} conclusion of the siege of Potidea. Grabos then became a subject ally of Macedon. The following year, Philip seems to have defeated Ketriporis, and reduced him to the status of a subject ally, although information for this campaign is very limited. He is also presumed to have {{defeated the}} Paionians at some point during this period, although there is no explicit record of this. There is no evidence that any of these allies received <b>any</b> <b>substantial</b> aid from Athens, which was still too preoccupied with the Social War.|$|E

5|$|The storm {{continued}} across Sydney Harbour {{and changed}} direction slightly {{to be heading}} north. It weakened after travelling over the Harbour, and was downgraded from a severe storm at 8:15pm. The Bureau of Meteorology had concluded that the storm would weaken after heading across Sydney Harbour, believing it was dissipating and would therefore not produce <b>any</b> more <b>substantial</b> hail as it moved northward; therefore it did not issue warnings for the northern suburbs.|$|R
25|$|Despite the lack, to date, of <b>any</b> actual <b>substantial</b> {{evidence}} implicating <b>any</b> {{party or}} individual, the Syrian government has borne {{the brunt of}} Lebanese and international outrage at the murder, because of its extensive military and intelligence influence in Lebanon, {{as well as the}} public rift between Hariri and Damascus just before his last resignation on 20 October 2004. The day after Hariri's resignation, pro-Syrian former Prime Minister Omar Karami was appointed Prime Minister.|$|R
5|$|Whilst {{the exact}} date Saint Padarn founded {{the church is}} uncertain, it seems clear however that Llanbadarn Fawr was an early sixth-century foundation, a Celtic clas church. The church {{may have been the}} seat of an abbot or bishop during the years {{immediately}} following Saint Padarn, who was traditionally said to be its first bishop (as a clas church, it was not a cathedral as we understand the term today, but closer to a collegiate church), nor did it necessarily possess <b>any</b> <b>substantial</b> buildings. It was one of the leading clasau of early Christian Wales, and the one we know most about, partly because of the significant role it played as a literary centre.|$|E
5|$|Saggers {{started the}} tour as the clear second-choice wicket-keeper, as Don Tallon {{had played in}} each of Australia's 11 Tests since the {{resumption}} of cricket after the Second World War, while Saggers was yet to make his Test debut. Saggers made his first-class debut shortly {{before the start of}} the war, and after the resumption, was regarded as the second in line for Test selection behind Tallon. However, as Australia did not make <b>any</b> <b>substantial</b> tours in the years immediately after the end of hostilities, there was no need to take a reserve gloveman on such trips. However, the trip to England meant more than six months abroad, so a back-up wicketkeeper was needed, and Saggers was selected for his first national squad.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security Act allows {{persons to}} be {{detained}} without trial for acting {{in any manner}} prejudicial {{to the security of}} Malaysia or to the maintenance of its essential services or economic life. It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution, which stipulates that if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by <b>any</b> <b>substantial</b> body of persons, whether inside or outside the Federation in respect of certain situations – including organized violence against persons or property, the excitement of disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the government, or the promotion of feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, the island republic retained both the Internal Security Act and Article 149 of the Constitution in its statute book.|$|E

40|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century Canada might in all {{fairness}} have been considered a backward country. She had not yet experienced <b>any</b> very <b>substantial</b> transition from an agricultural to an industrial way of life. In a sense she was still asleep, she was not truly in equilibrium. The world over farmers appeared to be relatively less affluent than industrial workers. The world over, therefore, there seemed to be a relative growth of industry accompanied by a resultant decline in agriculture...|$|R
50|$|To this day, economists {{can point}} to few, if <b>any,</b> {{examples}} of <b>substantial</b> economic growth among the LDCs under SAPs. Moreover, {{very few of the}} loans have been paid off. Pressure mounts to forgive these debts, some of which demand substantial portions of government expenditures to service.|$|R
5|$|Some {{soldiers}} had received training through the compulsory training scheme, while others {{had served as}} volunteers in the part-time forces before the war or {{as members of the}} British Army, but their numbers were limited. In contrast, the majority of officers initially appointed had previous military experience. This was largely through service in the pre-war militia, though, where there had been little to no formal officer training. In addition, there was a small cadre of junior officers who had been trained for the permanent force at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, but their numbers were very small and at the outbreak of the war the first class had to be graduated early {{in order for them to}} join the AIF, being placed mainly in staff positions. Other than small numbers of Duntroon graduates, from January 1915 the only means to be commissioned into the AIF was from the ranks of enlisted personnel. While the AIF's initial senior officers had been members of the pre-war military, few had <b>any</b> <b>substantial</b> experience in managing brigade-sized or larger units in the field as training exercises on this scale had been rarely conducted before the outbreak of hostilities. This inexperience contributed to tactical mistakes and avoidable casualties during the Gallipoli Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Some {{soldiers}} had received training through the compulsory training scheme {{that had been}} established in 1911, while others had served as volunteers in the part-time forces before the war or {{as members of the}} British Army, but their numbers were limited and in many cases the quality of the training they had received was also limited. The original intention had been that half the initial intake would consist of soldiers that were currently serving in the Militia, but ultimately this did not come to fruition and while about 8,000 of the original intake had some prior military experience, either through compulsory training or as volunteers, over 6,000 had none at all. In terms of officers, the situation was better. For example, within the 1st Division, of its initial 631 officers, 607 had had previous military experience. This was largely through service in the pre-war militia, though, where there had been little to no formal officer training. In addition, there was a small cadre of junior officers who had been trained for the permanent force at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, but their numbers were very small and at the outbreak of the war the first class had to be graduated early {{in order for them to}} join the AIF, being placed mainly in staff positions. Other than small numbers of Duntroon graduates, from January 1915 the only means to be commissioned into the AIF was from the ranks of enlisted personnel. As a result, by 1918 the majority of company and battalion commanders had risen from the ranks. While the AIF's initial senior officers had been members of the pre-war military, few had <b>any</b> <b>substantial</b> experience in managing brigade-sized or larger units in the field as training exercises on this scale had been rarely conducted before the outbreak of hostilities. This inexperience contributed to tactical mistakes and avoidable casualties during the Gallipoli campaign.|$|E

These wave packets have amplitudes exceeding {{the strength of}} the external magnetic field, along which they propagate. Alfven (left helicity) wave packets show strong steepening for p < 1, while fast (fight heIicity) wave packets hardly steepen for <b>any</b> beta. <b>Substantial</b> regions of opposite helicity form on the leading side of steepened Alfven wave packets.

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to traditional agnostics who often hold a skeptical view about gods or other metaphysical entities (i.e. “We can't or don't {{know for sure}} that there is a God"), “ietsists” take a viewpoint along the lines of, “And yet it feels like there is something out there..." [...] It is a form of religious liberalism or non-denominationalism.

40|$|In {{the chaotic}} nancial {{environment}} of Asia in 1997 - 1998, daily changes in stock prices of about 10 percent became commonplace. This paper analyzes {{what type of}} news moves the markets in those days of market jitters. We nd that movements are triggered by local and neighbor-country news, with news about agreements with international organizations and credit rating agencies having the most weight. However, some of those large changes cannot be explained by <b>any</b> apparent <b>substantial</b> news, but seem {{to be driven by}} herd instincts of the market itself. The evidence suggests that investors over-react to bad news...|$|R
50|$|The timber {{church was}} renovated {{and used as}} the Sunday School. The Methodist Church {{continued}} to have a solid presence in the town and church news was regularly reported in the Gympie Times and frequently {{the full text of}} a sermon would be published. In 1904, the Reverend Harry Youngman addressed the Chinese members of the congregation in their own language, an event which attracted hundreds of people, non-Chinese and non-Methodists alike. Small repairs were carried out on the church, hall and parsonage and {{it was not until the}} 1930s that <b>any</b> more <b>substantial</b> work was carried out on the site.|$|R
