50|$|A spathe {{is a large}} bract or pair of bracts {{forming a}} sheath to enclose the flower cluster of such plants as palms, arums, Irises, Crocuses, and dayflowers. In many <b>arums</b> (Araceae <b>family),</b> the spathe is petal-like, {{attracting}} pollinators to the flowers arranged on a type of spike called a spadix.|$|R
5000|$|Duckweed, {{or water}} lens, are {{flowering}} aquatic plants which float on or {{just beneath the}} surface of still or slow-moving bodies of fresh water and wetlands. Also known as [...] "bayroot", they arose from within the <b>arum</b> or aroid <b>family</b> (Araceae), so often are classified as the subfamily Lemnoideae within the Araceae. Classifications created prior {{to the end of the}} 20th century classify them as a separate family, Lemnaceae.|$|R

50|$|Scindapsus pictus (satin pothos, silver vine) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the <b>arum</b> <b>family</b> Araceae, native to Bangladesh, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo, Java, Sumatra, Sulawesi, and the Philippines.|$|E
5000|$|Anthurium and Zantedeschia are two {{well-known}} {{members of}} this family, as are Colocasia esculenta (taro) and Xanthosoma roseum (elephant ear or ‘ape). The largest unbranched inflorescence {{in the world is}} that of the arum Amorphophallus titanum (titan <b>arum).</b> [...] The <b>family</b> includes many ornamental plants: Dieffenbachia, Aglaonema, Caladium, Nephthytis, and Epipremnum, to name a few. In the genus Cryptocoryne are many popular aquarium plants. Philodendron is an important plant in the ecosystems of the rainforests and is often used in home and interior decorating. Symplocarpus foetidus (skunk cabbage) is a common eastern North American species. An interesting peculiarity is that this family includes the largest unbranched inflorescence, that of the titan arum, often erroneously called the [...] "largest flower" [...] and the smallest flowering plant and smallest fruit, found in the duckweed, Wolffia.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe inflorescences {{of several}} members of the <b>Arum</b> lily <b>family</b> warm up during {{flowering}} and are able to maintain their temperature at a constant level, relatively independent of the ambient temperature. The heat is generated via a mitochondrial respiratory pathway that is distinct from the cytochrome chain and involves a cyanide-resistant alternative oxidase (AOX). In this paper we have used flux control analysis to investigate the influence of temperature on the rate of respiration through both cytochrome and alternative oxidases in mitochondria isolated from the appendices of intact thermogenic Arum maculatum inflorescences. Results are presented which indicate that at low temperatures, the dehydrogenases are almost in full control of respiration but as the temperature increases flux control shifts to the AOX. On the basis of these results a simple model of thermoregulation is presented that is applicable to all species of thermogenic plants. The model takes into account the temperature characteristics of the separate components of the plant mitochondrial respiratory chain and the control of each process. We propose that 1) in all aroid flowers AOX assumes almost complete control over respiration, 2) the temperature profile of AOX explains the reversed relationship between ambient temperature and respiration in thermoregulating Arum flowers, 3) the thermoregulation process is the same in all species and 4) variations in inflorescence temperatures can easily be explained by variations in AOX protein concentrations...|$|R

5000|$|Lysichiton americanus, {{also called}} western skunk cabbage (USA), yellow skunk cabbage (UK), American skunk-cabbage (Britain and Ireland) or swamp lantern, is a plant found in swamps and wet woods, along streams {{and in other}} wet areas of the Pacific Northwest, where {{it is one of}} the few native species in the <b>arum</b> <b>family.</b> The plant is called skunk cabbage because of the {{distinctive}} [...] "skunky" [...] odor that it emits when it blooms. This odor will permeate the area where the plant grows, and can be detected even in old, dried specimens. The distinctive odor attracts its pollinators, scavenging flies and beetles. Although similarly named and with a similar smell, the plant is easy to distinguish from the eastern skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus), another species in the <b>arum</b> <b>family</b> found in eastern North America.|$|E
5000|$|Monstera is a genus {{of about}} 50 species of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} <b>arum</b> <b>family,</b> Araceae, native to tropical regions of the Americas. The genus is named from the Latin word for [...] "monstrous" [...] or [...] "abnormal", and refers to the unusual leaves with natural holes {{that members of the}} genus have.|$|E
50|$|Protarum is a {{monotypic}} genus {{of flowering}} {{plants in the}} <b>arum</b> <b>family</b> (Araceae). The single species composing the genus is Protarum sechellarum. It is endemic to the Seychelles. This species was previously placed in the subfamily Colocasioideae in the tribe Protareae, but it has since been reclassified to the subfamily Aroideae in the tribe Colocasieae.|$|E
5000|$|As {{is typical}} of the <b>Arum</b> <b>family,</b> these species develop an {{inflorescence}} consisting of an elongate or ovate spathe (a sheathing bract) which usually envelops the spadix (a flower spike with a fleshy axis). The spathe can have different colors, but mostly brownish-purple or whitish-green. On the inside, they contain ridges or warts, functioning as insect traps.|$|E
50|$|This {{member of}} the <b>arum</b> <b>family</b> Araceae is an {{epiphyte}} with aerial roots, able {{to grow up to}} 20 m high with large, leathery, glossy, heart-shaped leaves 25 - 90 cm long by 25 - 75 cm broad. Young plants have leaves that are smaller and entire with no lobes or holes, but soon produce lobed and fenestrate leaves.|$|E
5000|$|Alocasia macrorrhizos is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the <b>arum</b> <b>family,</b> Araceae, that it is native to rainforests from Malaysia to Queensland and has long been cultivated on many Pacific islands {{and elsewhere in the}} tropics. Common names include giant taro, ape, giant alocasia and pai. In Australia it is known as the cunjevoi (although that term also refers to a marine animal).|$|E
5000|$|Amorphophallus (from Ancient Greek amorphos, [...] "without form, misshapen" [...] + phallos, [...] "penis", {{referring}} {{to the shape of}} the prominent spadix), commonly known as Zaminkand, is a large genus of some 200 tropical and subtropical tuberous herbaceous plants from the <b>Arum</b> <b>family</b> (Araceae), native to Asia, Africa, Australia and various oceanic islands. A few species are edible as [...] "famine foods" [...] after careful preparation to remove irritating chemicals.|$|E
50|$|The Araceae are {{a family}} of {{monocotyledonous}} flowering plants in which flowers are borne on a type of inflorescence called a spadix. The spadix is usually accompanied by, and sometimes partially enclosed in, a spathe or leaf-like bract. Also known as the <b>arum</b> <b>family,</b> members are often colloquially known as aroids. This family of 114 genera and about 3750 known species is most diverse in the New World tropics, although also distributed in the Old World tropics and northern temperate regions.|$|E
5000|$|Pistia is a genus {{of aquatic}} {{plant in the}} <b>arum</b> <b>family,</b> Araceae. The single species it comprises, Pistia stratiotes, is often called water cabbage, water lettuce, Nile cabbage, or shellflower. Its native {{distribution}} is uncertain, but probably pantropical; it was first discovered from the Nile near Lake Victoria in Africa. It is now present, either naturally or through human introduction, in nearly all tropical and subtropical fresh waterways. The genus name {{is derived from the}} Greek word πιστός (pistos), meaning [...] "water," [...] and refers to the aquatic nature of the plants.|$|E
5000|$|Wolfiporia extensa (Peck) Ginns (syn. Poria cocos F.A.Wolf) is {{a fungus}} {{in the family}} Polyporaceae. It is a wood-decay fungus but has a {{subterranean}} growth habit. It is notable {{in the development of}} a large, long-lasting underground sclerotium that resembles a small coconut. This sclerotium called [...] "(Chinese) Tuckahoe" [...] or fu-ling, is not the same as the true tuckahoe used as Indian bread by Native Americans, which is the arrow arum, Peltandra virginica, a flowering tuberous plant in the <b>arum</b> <b>family.</b> W. extensa is also used extensively as a medicinal mushroom in Chinese medicine. Indications for use in the traditional Chinese medicine include promoting urination, to invigorate the spleen function (i.e., digestive function), and to calm the mind.|$|E
50|$|Lysichiton has flowers {{which are}} typical of those of the family to which it belongs (the <b>arum</b> <b>family</b> or Araceae). The {{individual}} flowers are small and are tightly packed on a fleshy stem called a spadix which {{is surrounded by a}} white or yellow but otherwise leaf-like bract called a spathe. The spathe is hooded or boat-shaped at the top. Lysichiton has flowers with both male and female parts present (bisexual), unlike many other aroids. After fertilization, the green fruits become embedded in the spadix; each fruit usually has two seeds but may have up to four. Several large leaves appear either just before flowering or soon afterwards; each has a short stalk (petiole). Plants die down to a vertical rhizome in winter.|$|E
50|$|Xanthosoma is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} <b>arum</b> <b>family,</b> Araceae. The genus is native to tropical America but widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical regions. Several are grown for their starchy corms, an important food staple of tropical regions, known variously as malanga, otoy, otoe, cocoyam (or new cocoyam), tannia, tannier, yautía, macabo, ocumo, macal, taioba, dasheen, quequisque, ape and (in Papua New Guinea) as Singapore taro (taro kongkong). Many other species (including especially X. roseum) are used as ornamental plants, and in popular horticultural literature are known as ‘ape or elephant ear (from the purported resemblance of the leaf to an elephant's ear), although the latter name is sometimes also applied to members with similar appearance and uses in the closely related genera Caladium, Colocasia (i.e., taro), and Alocasia.|$|E
30|$|Pistia stratiotes is a {{floating}} macrophyte. It is a genus of aquatic {{plant in the}} <b>arum</b> <b>family,</b> Araceae. The single species it comprises, P. stratiotes, is often called water cabbage, water lettuce, Nile cabbage or shellflower. The living aquatic macrophyte P. stratiotes has been extensively used in bioaccumulation processes (Sune et al. 2007), phytoremediation (Skinner et al. 2007) and for removal of Cr(VI) ions (Das et al. 2013), which makes the study using dead biomass very important. So, this biomass {{can also be utilized}} to remove carbaryl from aqueous solutions which formed the motivation of this study.|$|E
40|$|To date, limited {{numbers of}} dental {{calculus}} samples have been analyzed by researchers in diverse {{parts of the}} world. The combined analyses of these have provided some general guidelines {{for the analysis of}} calculus that is non-destructive to archaeological teeth. There is still a need for a quantitative study of large numbers of calculus samples to establish protocols, assess the level of contamination, evaluate the quantity of microfossils in dental calculus, and to compare analysis results with the literature concerning the biology of calculus formation. We analyzed dental calculus from 53 teeth from four Brazilian sambaquis. Sambaquis are the shell-mounds that were established prehistorically along the Brazilian coast. The analysis of sambaqui dental calculi shows that there are relatively high concentrations of microfossils (phytoliths and starch), mineral fragments, and charcoal in dental calculus. Mineral fragments and charcoal are possibly contaminants. The largest dental calculi have the lowest concentrations of microfossils. Biologically, this is explained by individual variation in calculus formation between people. Importantly, starch is ubiquitous in dental calculus. The starch and phytoliths show that certainly Dioscorea (yam) and Araucaria angustifolia (Parana pine) were eaten by sambaqui people. Araceae (<b>arum</b> <b>family),</b> Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato) and Zea mays (maize) were probably in their diet. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
