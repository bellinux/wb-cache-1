5|$|An elf (plural: elves) {{is a type}} of human-shaped supernatural {{being in}} Germanic mythology and folklore. In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves seem {{generally}} to have been thought of as beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people <b>and</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> either helping or hindering them. However, the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space, and have flourished in both pre-Christian and Christian cultures.|$|E

5|$|Construction was in two phases. A {{level section}} from Tiverton to Lowdwells on the Devon/Somerset border, opened in 1814, and {{was capable of}} {{carrying}} broad-beam barges, carrying up to 40tons. The Somerset section, suitable for tub-boats, which were about 20feet (6.1m) long <b>and</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> carrying eight tons, opened in 1839. It included an inclined plane and seven boat lifts, the earliest lifts to see commercial service in the UK. The lifts predated the Anderton Boat Lift by nearly 40 years.|$|E
5|$|Daniel C. Lindley, {{a native}} of Middlebury, Vermont, {{compiled}} a book of Morgan breeding stallions, published in 1857. Colonel Joseph Battell, also a Middlebury, Vermont native, published {{the first volume of}} the Morgan Horse Register in 1894, marking the beginning of a formal breed registry. In 1907, the US Department of Agriculture established the US Morgan Horse Farm in Weybridge, Vermont on land donated by Battell for the purpose of perpetuating and improving the Morgan breed. The breeding program aimed to produce horses that were sound, sturdy, well-mannered, <b>and</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> performing well either under saddle or in harness. In 1951, the Morgan Horse Farm was transferred from the USDA to the Vermont Agricultural College (now the University of Vermont).|$|E

So, brain models that don't reflect this are too abstract to be representative of brain operation; models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational resources. However, the Human Brain Project is {{trying to build a}} realistic, detailed computational model of the entire human brain. The wisdom of this approach has been publicly contested, with high-profile scientists {{on both sides of the}} argument.|$|E

5|$|Postier Bretons were {{developed}} {{as a result of}} crossbreeding with the Norfolk Trotter and the Hackney during the 19th century. This type is bred mainly in central Brittany, has a very attractive gait, is a good coach horse, <b>and</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> light farming work. Its name originates from its use in pulling mail coaches. The Postier was used extensively by the French Horse Artillery, and it {{has been described as a}} lighter version of the Suffolk Punch draft breed from Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|The RAN {{conducted}} armament effectiveness {{studies of}} each of the six DDL variants in parallel with Y-ARD's development of the designs. These studies found that including an area air defence capability and an ability to operate two helicopters greatly improved the DDL's effectiveness. As a result, these features were included in the Navy's specification for the DDL design which was issued in late 1970. By this time the design had evolved to specify a general-purpose destroyer of 4,200 tons, armed with a five-inch gun and a Tartar missile launcher, <b>and</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> operating two helicopters. The changes increased the cost of building the ships, and the number planned was reduced to three. Nevertheless, the DDL design was considered likely to result in very capable ships, with the 1972–73 edition of Jane's Fighting Ships commenting favourably.|$|E

In addition, the 277th Aviation Support Battalion (TF Mountain Eagle) provides supporting services to the combat battalions when they are deployed, making the brigade capable of operating independently of higher command headquarters, <b>and</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> taking on additional battalions and other, smaller units when deployed, as necessary.|$|E

On maps where there is no fog of war, players can see what opponents are doing at any time. Extensive support for 3D acceleration enables the player to view the game in 16-bit or 32-bit colour.

5|$|The game series {{features}} {{many types}} of Tyrants {{as the result of}} several different experiments. Following the discovery of the Progenitor virus, the Umbrella Corporation’s founders become eager to create a Bio-Organic Weapon (BOW) that is both powerful <b>and</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> following orders. Prior to the events of Resident Evil Zero, Umbrella used the Progenitor virus to create the Tyrant virus (T-virus), which they believe can be used to manufacture powerful organisms. A problem with the virus’ compatibility with humans set the project back, as only humans with a very rare genetic makeup are capable of mutating into potent and manageable life forms. Umbrella eventually overcame this setback by resorting to using clones of Sergei Vladimir, one of their executives who happens to be genetically compatible.|$|E
5|$|The {{island of}} Helgoland {{received}} four twin gun turrets between 1909–12, although their exact type is unknown. Battery Kaiser Wilhelm II {{was built to}} protect the port of Zeebrugge in Occupied Flanders during World War I. It consisted of four guns in concrete barbettes mounted on Bettungsschiessgerüst (BSG) (firing platforms). These manually powered mounts rotated on a pivot {{at the front of}} the mount and the rear was supported by rollers resting on a semi-circular rail. They were equipped with a gun shield <b>and</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> all-around fire. They were manned by sailors from Naval Artillery Regiment (Matrosen Artillerie Regiment) 1.|$|E

5|$|From 1905, Giovanni Bausan {{served as}} a {{training}} ship for stokers and mechanics until {{the outbreak of the}} Italo-Turkish War in 1912. Returning to active duty as Flagship Cyrenaica, she served in the shore bombardment role {{until the end of the}} war, when she was again returned to second-line service as a distilling ship. Fitted with four distillers <b>and</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> producing 200 tons of fresh water every 24 hours, she was operating in this role at the start of the First World War. Because of the pressing need for artillery for service with the army, Giovanni Bausan was partially disarmed in 1915, losing her 10-inch guns and two of the 6-inch pieces. Later in the war, the rest of her armament was removed. She was reassigned for service as a seaplane depot ship at Brindisi. Decommissioned in 1919, she was sold for scrap in March 1920 and broken up soon after.|$|E
