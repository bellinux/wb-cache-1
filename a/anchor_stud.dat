40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{construction}} industry {{has relied on}} the headed <b>stud</b> <b>anchor</b> to provide connection between concrete andmultiple other structural elements formanyyears. In the past, the design engineer followednumerous accepted rational methods of designing for allowable strength and serviceability in accordance with accepted standard procedures. Recent changes in the requirements inACI 318, {{as well as new}} developments from testing completed by PCI, have started to impact the design engineer’s practice in designing anchorages to concrete. Failure to stay current with new design procedures can result in liberal design solutions. The historical overview discusses the chronology of design methods based on various boundary conditions and load applications. The standard for designing headed <b>stud</b> <b>anchor</b> connections has been impacted by new testing results compiled by PCI. This article is an overview of the current state-of-the-art approach used by precast structural designers for headed <b>stud</b> <b>anchor</b> design. ...|$|R
40|$|The current AISC Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2005 a) is {{the lead}} {{specification}} for composite construction in the U. S. However, these provisions do not provide a recommendation for computing the strength of headed steel <b>stud</b> <b>anchors</b> (traditionally used as shear connectors) under tension or combined tension and shear. Headed <b>stud</b> <b>anchors</b> are subjected to these types of forces in composite structures such as infill walls, composite coupling beams, the connection region of composite columns, or composite column bases. While ACI 318 - 08 Appendix D (ACI, 2008) and PCI 6 th Ed. (PCI, 2004) includes provisions for such conditions, those provisions are geared for more general anchorage conditions than are typically seen in composite construction. It would thus be beneficial to have design guidance specifically for the case of headed steel <b>stud</b> <b>anchors</b> subjected to tension or combined tension and shear in composite construction, evaluated {{within the context of}} the AISC Specification. In this work, different strength equations to compute the nominal tensile strength of a headed stud are reviewed and compared to experimental results. The resulting recommendations seek to ensure a ductile failure in the steel shank instead of a brittle failure within the concrete. Several criteria are proposed to ensure that a ductile failure controls in composite construction, and, different headed stud configurations and detailing reinforcement recommendations are proposed to improve the ductile behavior of headed <b>stud</b> <b>anchors</b> subjected to tension and combined tension and shear. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
40|$|The formula in the 2005 American Institute of Steel Construction Specification {{to compute}} the {{strength}} of headed steel <b>stud</b> <b>anchors</b> (shear connectors) in composite steel/concrete structures {{has been used in}} the United States since 1993 after being proposed based primarily on the results of push-out tests. In the past several decades, the range of members used in composite structures has increased significantly, as has the number of tests in the literature on the monotonic and cyclic behavior of headed studs in composite construction. This work reviews 391 monotonic and cyclic tests from the literature on experiments of headed <b>stud</b> <b>anchors</b> and proposes formulas for the limit states of steel failure and concrete failure of headed <b>stud</b> <b>anchors</b> subjected to shear force without the use of metal deck. Detailing provisions to prevent premature pryout failure are also discussed. This work also reviews proposals from several authors and provides recommended shear strength values for seismic behavior of headed studs.

The scope of this research includes composite beam-columns [typically concrete-encased steel shapes (SRC) or concrete-filled steel tubes (CFT) ], concrete-encased and concrete-filled beams, boundary elements of composite wall systems, composite connections, composite column base conditions, and related forms of composite construction. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
40|$|Composite Steel-Concrete {{construction}} {{is widely used}} in buildings and bridges even in regions of high seismic risk. It is now common practice to use cold formed steel sheets as permanent formwork {{for the support of}} the soffits of reinforced concrete and also as part of the tension steel in the composite beam that is formed after the concrete has hardened. The construction should ensure monolithic action between the prefabricated steel and in-situ concrete so that they act as a single structural unit. Structural elements, such as <b>anchors,</b> <b>studs,</b> channels and spirals, intended to transmit the horizontal shear between the prefabricated member and the cast-in-situ concrete and also to prevent vertical separation at the interface. Shear connectors, anchors (hoops, loops, and struts) are used as a means for comprising steel and concrete, as well as friction through high value crews and their combination. There is a common term – Shear connectors that defines the various forms of steel structural parts connected to the upper segment of the steel plate most often by welding. In this experimental analysis the T-shape shear connectors will be used in composite beams as they have the highest characteristic resistance and the mode of failure changes for different concrete strengths and different arrangements. Moreover the shear connectors will be provided in various arrangements and the optimum location which gives the high flexural and shear strength going to be arrived. The flexural strength between conventional reinforced concrete beam and composite beams with shear connector is were compared and found that the T-Connectors facing the centre of beam (NT- 2) holds the cold formed steel well with the concrete compared to other composite beam...|$|R

However, {{lack of access}} to the inner surface of these sections prevents connections with conventional bolts. To overcome this problem, blind bolts that can be installed only from one side can be used. A new type of blind bolt, the headed <b>stud</b> <b>anchored</b> blind bolt, has been developed at the University of Melbourne in collaboration with Ajax Fasteners. This type of blind bolt, in addition to bearing on the tube wall, is anchored in the infill concrete which results in improved stiffness and strength when it is subjected to tensile force. The pull-out behaviour and strength of headed <b>stud</b> <b>anchored</b> blind bolts as individuals or groups of two and three are studied in this research.

The attraction grows stronger as the magnet gets closer to the metal in the walling. The strongest attraction point, if due to a metal fastener in the wall, should indicate {{the location of a}} stud, but careless wall construction can leave many metal fasteners off the studs or towards the edge, rendering the spot useless for <b>anchoring</b> objects.

50|$|Many jurisdictions in Asia, Europe and North America {{seasonally}} allow snow tires {{with metal}} or ceramic studs to improve grip on packed snow or ice. Such tires are prohibited in other jurisdictions or during warmer months {{because of the}} damage they may cause to road surfaces. The metal studs are fabricated by encapsulating a hard pin in a softer material base, sometimes called the jacket. The pin is often made of tungsten carbide, a very hard high performance ceramic. The softer base is the part that <b>anchors</b> the <b>stud</b> in the rubber of the tire. As the tire wears with use, the softer base wears so that its surface is {{at about the same}} level as the rubber, whereas the hard pin wears so that it continues to protrude from the tire. The pin should protrude at least 1 mm for the tire to function properly. Snow tires do not eliminate skidding on ice and snow, but they greatly reduce risks.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} and analytical {{study on the}} punching strengthening of reinforced concrete two-way slabs using external steel plates is presented. Five reinforced concrete square slabs of 100 mm thickness were tested over simply supported four sides of 1000 mm span under central square patch load of 100 mm size up to failure. One control slab was tested without strengthening; however, four tested slabs were strengthened using four configurations of square steel plates provided with steel <b>anchor</b> shear <b>studs.</b> Such configurations considered two different plate thickness, two plate side dimensions and different arrangement and diameter of shear studs. The strengthened four slabs showed improved stiffness and punching shear capacity. The magnitude of improvement depended on the plate dimensions and the studs diameter and arrangement. An analytical approach was proposed for predicting the punching shear strength increase due to using the strengthening steel plate. The proposed approach {{was applied to the}} tested specimens {{with the use of the}} punching shear strength equations adopted by several codes of practice and proved to be in good agreement with the test results.

The collet diameter matches the bore of the inner tube, having the larger end slightly greater than the bore while the smaller diameter is slightly less than the bore. A threaded <b>stud,</b> <b>anchored</b> at its other end to the tube, is then used to pull the collet into the tube. The increasing diameter of the collet forces the inner tube to expand and be pushed against the inner wall of the outer tube thus locking the two tubes together. The inner tube is often slotted to facilitate this expansion.|$|R
40|$|Generally, L {{anchor bolt}} {{system has been}} used {{for a long period of}} time in {{construction}} industry as one of the distributing load structures. However, there are some weaknesses in L anchor bolt which may straighten and pullup when charged with tensile load. Current practices prefer to use other types of anchor bolt systems, such as headed <b>studs</b> <b>anchor</b> bolt system to replace the L anchor bolt design. There has been lack of studies to prove that it is more effective in terms of performance. A new T anchor bolt which was basically modified from headed <b>studs</b> <b>anchor</b> bolt was proposed in this study to compare its performance of tensile loading in concrete failure to typical L design. This study aims to determine whether the T anchor bolt system gives better performance as compared to an L anchor bolt system. The performance was rated based on tensile loading on concrete failure pattern. A pullout test was conducted on two different anchor bolt systems, namely L and T. The anchor bolt embedded depth, h in concrete were varied according to their hook or bend radius. Each sample was repeated twice. There were totally eight samples. The hook or bend radius used were 50 mm and 57. 5 mm for sample L 1 and L 2, respectively. 90 -degree bend were used on sample T 1 and T 2. Based on test results, it can be seen that the performance of concrete failure pattern under tensile load on both L and T anchor bolt design samples with 200 mm embedment depth was better than deeper embedment depth of 230 mm. But the L anchor bolt design gives the best results as compared to T design. Although T anchor bolt design shows higher resistance before first bond failure to the concrete sample. T anchor bolt was analysed and needed deeper embedment depth to allow formation of cone pull-out shape to acquire better performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{flat plate}} floor {{system is a}} common design choice for {{multilevel}} buildings and car parks. Despite several advantages of the system, it {{has a tendency to}} fail in punching shear which is a brittle failure at the slab-column connection and often occurs at a load well below the flexural capacity of the slab. Openings often need to be constructed in the vicinity of slab-column connections {{for a variety of reasons}} including ventilation, plumbing, heating, air-conditioning and electrical purposes. When openings are constructed close to the slab-column connection, the volume of concrete resisting transverse shear is reduced, hence increasing the likelihood of punching shear failure of the connection. To strengthen flat plate slab-column connections and to provide adequate ductility, properly placed and <b>anchored</b> shear <b>stud</b> reinforcement (SSR) is often utilised. The focus of this paper is on the numerical analysis of slab-column connections with openings and SSR using the nonlinear Layered Finite Element Method (LFEM). Three parametric studies are conducted to investigate the effect of varying opening size and location as well as column aspect ratio on the punching shear behaviour of the slab-column connections. Results on the shear strength and deflection of the connections are compared and discussed in some detail. This investigation is an important step in determining the size and location of openings and the size of columns for the optimum structural performance of flat plate systems. No Full Tex...|$|R

"May 2012 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Cold-formed steel studs exhibit favorable properties of strength and ductility that could provide the toughness needed to resist blast loading. Fully <b>anchored</b> steel <b>studs</b> can be prohibitively expensive, and thus it is important to evaluate the response of cold-formed steel <b>studs</b> that are <b>anchored</b> to floor slabs using conventional methods. To promote the widespread use of conventionally constructed cold-formed steel stud walls for blast design, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive methodology that accounts for the many parameters that affect the response of the wall. The objective of this thesis is to lay the foundations for a theory-based design methodology for conventional steel stud walls. Twenty-seven static tests have been conducted utilizing full-scale samples and deflection-controlled load application. An analytical model for predicting the static resistance of these walls under uniform loading was developed and verified through the testing. The largest improvement in performance was made by using additional stud-to-track screws, which increased toughness by up to ten times by utilizing four screws {{on each side of the}} connection.

40|$|The need {{to protect}} structures, and the people inside these structures, {{has led to the}} Army Corps of Engineers {{developing}} blast design criteria for buildings. It is critical to know how a structure will behave under a given explosion and design wall systems to resist this type of load by developing adequate design criteria. To predict the dynamic behavior of steel stud wall systems using dynamic modeling, a valid static resistance function for cold-formed steel studs must be developed. In conjunction with the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, the University of Missouri-Columbia has been conducting experimental tests to define the entire static resistance function to failure for different wall systems. The key to utilizing steel studs in a blast resistant wall system is by properly <b>anchoring</b> the steel <b>studs</b> to the structure to achieve cross-sectional failure of the stud in tension, as opposed to connection failure. Utilizing the steels stud strength and ductility allows for significant energy-absorbing capabilities important in blast resistance. A modeling program has been developed to predict the dynamic response of cold-formed steel stud wall systems. Following details and discussion of testing procedures, experimental data for different steel stud wall systems is presented along with comparisons to the current modeling predictions...|$|R
40|$|The {{interior}} {{surface of}} a concrete containment structure is lined with thin metallic plates to provide a leak-tight barrier against the uncontrolled release of radioactivity to the environment, as required by 10 CFR Part 50. The thickness of the liner plates is generally between 1 / 4 in. (6. 2 mm) and 3 / 8 in. (9. 5 mm). The liner plates {{are attached to the}} concrete containment wall by <b>stud</b> <b>anchors</b> or structural rolled shapes or both. The design process assumes that the liner plates do not carry loads. However, normal loads, such as from concrete shrinkage, creep, and thermal changes, imposed on the concrete containment structure, are transferred to the liner plates through the anchorage system. Internal pressure and temperature loads are directly applied to the liner plates. Thus, under design-base conditions, the liner plates could experience significant strains. Some plants may have metal containments instead of concrete containments with liner plates. Fatigue of the liner plates or metal containments may be considered in the design based on an assumed number of loading cycles for the current operating term.

It has been presented and discussed for inclusion in Eurocode 5 and a Swedish handbook has been presented. In the plastic method, {{you can choose to}} transfer the anchoring force via the leading stud to the substrate, corresponding to a fully anchored shear wall (no uplift of studs), but you can also choose to utilize the sheathings to transfer the tensile force via the sheathing-to-framing joints to the substrate by anchoring the bottom rail, corresponding to a partially <b>anchored</b> shear wall (<b>studs</b> experience uplift). By the plastic method several alternatives for anchoring the wall are possible and they can also be combined {{in such a way that}} each of them take a portion of the uplifting force, e. g. through a simple tying down device, through the sheathing-to-framing joints and through anchoring of the shear wall to the transverse wall. The method also makes it possible to include the load-bearing capacity of wall segments including openings. The handbook treats primarily shear walls, but for the sake of completeness some aspects of the roof and floor diaphragms are also discussed.

30|$|Berman et al. (2005) {{investigated}} CFS frames {{using both}} X-braced and steel-plated shear walls. The main aim {{of their research}} was to provide an engineering guideline for evaluating both {{of these types of}} CFS walls considering stiffness, ductility and energy dissipation. They reported that the maximum initial stiffness was related to the X-braced frame specimen, while the maximum ductility was provided by steel plate shear wall. Interestingly, using scaled hysteretic results, they found that the energy dissipated was similar for both X-braced frames and steel plate shear walls. Kim et al. (2006) performed a shaker table test on a full-scale two-story one-bay CFS shear panel structure. Each story consisted of two identical shear walls of 2.8  m length and 3.0  m height separated from each other by 3.9  m center to center. The two chords were constructed from three C-sections forming a two-cell closed section, and columns were welded to steel anchors and bolted to the slab through the top and bottom tracks. A heavy square RC slab of 4.4  ×  4.4  m 2  by  200  mm thickness along with additional mass was placed at the top of each floor level, which made the total mass at each floor level equal to 256  kN. As the second story frame was identical to the first story, the damage occurred mostly in the first story as expected. Connections and anchors to the base beam were designed for the maximum over-strength of straps, based on TI 809 - 07 (1998) code; however, no pre-tensioning was applied to the tension-only straps in spite of explicit recommendation in the code. The system was completely symmetrical and the centers of mass and stiffness were located at the same point and parallel to shear walls of the structure, to preclude torsional and out-of-plane responses. The structure was then loaded to a normalized accelerogram, which possessed spectral response acceleration equal to the design response spectrum around the fundamental period of the test specimen. The test caused significant yielding in the form of severe nonlinear behavior in the first floor straps along their entire length and yielding of <b>studs</b> near the <b>anchors.</b> The <b>studs</b> did not develop full flexural strength due to local buckling and this impaired their potential contribution to the story shear resistance. The studs’ contribution further decreased (about 15  %) due to anchor deformation, which created a gap between the track and the slab. The results showed that during the large amplitude tests, the X-strap bracing showed very ductile, but highly pinched, hysteretic behavior. The results of this study can be considered conservative because the effect of non-structural gypsum board cladding was not considered in the test.|$|R

This method allows the designer {{to calculate the}} load-carrying capacity of partially anchored shear walls, where the leading <b>stud</b> is not <b>anchored</b> against uplift. The anchorage system of shear walls is provided by anchor bolts in the bottom rail and hold downs at the leading <b>stud.</b> <b>Anchor</b> bolts provide horizontal shear continuity between the bottom rail and the foundation. Hold downs are directly connecting the vertical leading stud to the foundation. Sometimes hold downs are not provided and only the bottom rail is anchored to the substrate.

In this report hold downs have been experimentally studied {{with respect to the}} strength and stiffness of the connection. Four different types of hold downs have been tested. The specimen was subjected to tension load applied to the stud. Four tests series are presented. Each series was divided into different sets according to the type of fastener used with the hold down device. The results show that the failure load is higher when hold downs with anchor bolts are used, up to ten times higher than the anchorage that uses only screws or nails. The failure mode vary with the type of hold down and the type of fasteners used. The tests showed three primary failure modes: failure of the stud when a bolt is used as the fastener between hold down device and stud, failure due to pull-out of the screws or nails from the rail and failure due to failure or pull-out of screws or nails from stud. Also, failure of the stud itself occurred in some tests caused by some defect of the timberGodkänd; 2012; 20120116 (giucap...|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Steel stud wall systems are a common building material known for their low cost and ease of construction. However, standard building practices cause them to be inefficient with respect to explosive resistant design. Poorly designed anchor systems causes steel stud walls to achieve only a fraction of their potential during blast loading. The University of Missouri is researching new methods for <b>anchoring</b> infill steel <b>stud</b> walls to a building frame or floor slabs to protect occupants during an explosion. By combining the high ductility of bearing connections with the high strength of pin connections, a hybrid connection has the potential to greatly improve the dynamic response of steel stud walls. This research focused on creating an analytical model to predict the behavior of a steel stud wall utilizing hybrid connections. The model was verified by testing sample walls in a quasi-static loading tree. Resistance functions generated from the analytical model were incorporated into SSWAC to predict a wall system's dynamic response to any blast scenario. The analytical model predicts the response of a steel stud wall in four distinct phases; elastic bending, plastic bending, elastic tension, and bearing. The analytical model was proven to closely predict the experimental resistance functions for all regions of the walls response. This document concentrates on the design and verification of an analytical model to predict wall behavior. It covers all assumptions and calculations used to predict behavior. It also covers all methods for construction and testing of walls for validation...|$|R

This dissertation presents findings and recommendations from experimental and analytical investigations of the performance of SC walls subjected to far-field blast loads. ^ Twelve SC panels were tested in the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineering Research and Development Center (ERDC) Blast Load Simulator (BLS). These panels varied flexure and shear reinforcement ratios, tie bar spacing, and steel faceplate strength. Results from the physical experiments were used to benchmark numerical models which were then used to expand the experimental database and perform a series of parametric studies investigating the influence of blast load, geometric, material, and analysis parameters. ^ Two benchmarked models were developed: (1) detailed finite element (FE) models using the non-linear FE code LS-DYNA, and (2) idealized single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) models using experimentally validated bilinear strain hardening static resistance functions and exponential decay or triangular load pulse forcing functions. The idealized static resistance functions were developed from static tests of eight configurations of SC walls which were also used to benchmark the FE modeling method. The results from the static experimental tests and benchmarked models are also provided in this dissertation. ^ Results from the physical experiments and analytical parametric studies were used to develop design recommendations.
