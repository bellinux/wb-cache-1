5|$|While Trikoupis {{followed}} {{a policy of}} retrenchment within the established borders of the Greek state, having learned <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>lesson</b> about the vicissitudes of the Great Powers, his main opponents, the Nationalist Party led by Theodoros Deligiannis, sought to inflame the anti-Turkish feelings of the Greeks at every opportunity. The next opportunity arose in 1885 when Bulgarians rose in revolt in Eastern Rumelia and united the province with Bulgaria. Deligiannis rode to victory over Trikoupis in elections that year saying that if the Bulgarians could defy the Treaty of Berlin, so should the Greeks.|$|E

Of this great number two only offered insults to the gang of prisoners....But little and petty as it was it galled horribly. The soldiers felt the sting and scowled back; the officers looked straight before them. Yet it was <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>lesson.</b> Only a few days before I had read in the newspapers of how the Kaffirs had jeered at the Boer prisoners when they were marched into Pietermaritzburg, saying, 'Where are your passes?' It had seemed a very harmless joke then, but now I understood how a prisoner feels these things.|$|E

25|$|In 1914, Roosevelt made an ill-conceived {{decision}} {{to run for}} the seat of retiring Republican Senator Elihu Root of New York. Though Roosevelt won the backing of Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo and Governor Martin H. Glynn, he faced a formidable opponent in the Tammany-backed James W. Gerard. He also lacked Wilson's backing, as Wilson needed Tammany's forces to help marshal his legislation and secure his 1916 re-election. Roosevelt was soundly defeated in the Democratic primary by Gerard, who in turn lost the general election to Republican James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr. Roosevelt learned <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>lesson,</b> that federal patronage alone, without White House support, could not defeat a strong local organization. After the election, Roosevelt and the boss of the Tammany Hall machine, Charles Francis Murphy, sought an accommodation with one another and became political allies.|$|E

500|$|The Conservative Party led by Edward Heath won the 1970 general election, and Thatcher was {{subsequently}} {{appointed to the}} Cabinet as Secretary of State for Education and Science. During her first months in office she attracted public attention {{as a result of}} Chancellor Iain Macleod's attempts to cut spending. She gave priority to academic needs in schools, while administering public expenditure cuts on the state education system, resulting in the abolition of free milk for schoolchildren aged seven to eleven. She held that few children would suffer if schools were charged for milk, but agreed to provide younger children with a third of a pint daily, for nutritional purposes. Cabinet papers later revealed that she opposed the policy but had been forced into it by the Treasury. Her decision provoked a storm of protest from both Labour and the press, leading to the notorious turn of phrase [...] "Margaret Thatcher, Milk Snatcher". She reportedly considered leaving politics in the aftermath and later wrote in her autobiography: [...] "I learned <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>lesson</b> [...] I had incurred the maximum of political odium for the minimum of political benefit." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>lesson,</b> that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E

[...] PopMatterss Cynthia Fuchs stated it is formulaic as it has some [...] "conventions that make so many other genre films feel stale," [...] but that it [...] "torques them slightly", emphasizing the [...] "intellectual activities" [...] Akeelah gets involved with. Furthermore, the film was described as [...] "derivatively entertaining in a feel-good sort of way" [...] by Rick Groen in an article for The Globe and Mail. Ingman of The Austin Chronicle {{described it as a}} typical sports film and felt it was heavy-handed at times. However, she praised it for its thems and called the film a [...] "houghtful, engaging," [...] one and said it has [...] "cross-gender appeal". Morris of The Boston Globe argued, [...] "If Akeelah and the Bee is a generic, well-oiled commercial contraption, it is the first to credibly dramatize the plight of a truly gifted, poor black child."

A couple examples would be “Crocodile and Bull,” “Heron, Fish, and Crab,” and “Frog and Snake.” In the “Heron, Fish, and Crab” story, the characters learn <b>a</b> very <b>valuable</b> <b>lesson.</b> The bird in the story is wearing a headdress to try to disguise himself as a shaman {{so that he can}} go and catch fish. He starts examining three fish when he is attacked by the crab that starts to pinch his neck. The crab sees that the heron has disguised himself to confuse the fish so he pinched him to death.
