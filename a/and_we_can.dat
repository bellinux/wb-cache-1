5|$|The prose, while simple at {{the level}} of the {{sentence}} (<b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> safely assume that Hofmann's translation is very faithful to the original), is shifty, blurred, to the point where at times we are left unsure as to what exactly is going on – a deliberate flight from causation, quite understandable in a country where everyone (even, we learn, the horses) has been driven mad by fear.|$|E
5|$|The census {{report of}} 2010 Zambian census was {{released}} {{during the first}} week of March 2013 by Fredson Yamba, Secretary to the Treasury of the Government of Zambia. He quoted that “Population is our most valuable resource <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only take stock of it through an activity like the census. We now have the data, therefore, the challenge remains with all of us to ensure it is put into good use by making informed decisions for our people,”. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) helped the Government of Zambia, especially the Child Welfare Ministry to update the data from the Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS) and data on all key performance indicators of the National Development Plan (ZNDP) during 2013.|$|E

25|$|An infinite-dimensional {{version of}} an inner product space is a Hilbert space, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> no longer speak of {{matrices}}. However, matrices are merely representations of linear operators, and these we still have. So, generalizing both the matrix mapping and the complex plane mapping, we may define a Cayley transform of operators.|$|E
25|$|Writing {{systems can}} be {{independent}} from languages, we can have multiple writing systems for a language, e.g., Hindi and Urdu; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> have one writing system for multiple languages, e.g., the Arabic script. Chinese characters were also borrowed by variant countries as their early writing systems, e.g., the early writing systems of Vietnamese language {{until the beginning of}} the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{absolute}} {{continuity of}} f(k) on the closed interval between a and x its derivative f(k+1) exists as an L1-function, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> use fundamental theorem of calculus and integration by parts. This same proof applies for the Riemann integral assuming that f(k) is continuous on the closed interval and differentiable {{on the open}} interval between a and x, and {{this leads to the}} same result than using the mean value theorem.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, {{argued that}} all things have a {{universal}} form, {{which could be}} either a property or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, {{so that we can}} speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.|$|E
25|$|The {{fight is}} not for us, not for our {{personal}} wants and needs. It is for every animal that has ever suffered and died in the vivisection labs, and for every animal that will suffer and die in those same labs unless we end this evil business now. The souls of the tortured dead cry out for justice, the cry of the living is for freedom. We can create that justice <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> deliver that freedom. The animals have no one but us. We will not fail them.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, {{cyberpunk}} authors like William Gibson {{turned away}} from the optimism and support for progress of traditional science fiction. This dystopian vision of the near future is described in the work of Philip K. Dick, such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? <b>and</b> <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> Remember It for You Wholesale, which resulted in the films Blade Runner and Total Recall. The Star Wars franchise helped spark a new interest in space opera. C. J. Cherryh's detailed explorations of alien life and complex scientific challenges influenced a generation of writers.|$|E
25|$|Another stylistic choice {{she makes}} is {{frequently}} beginning with an epigraph from the written {{records of the}} long assault on Native Peoples. Often she uses this epigraph from the historical, archeological world, as a jumping off point for her poetry which is narrated by a Native-identified voice, allowing for the reader to draw {{the connection between the}} two. This juxtaposition brings the “historical artifact” of bone or cloth to life <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> see the skin being literally ripped away with the language of the poetry and giving the casual observer a real vision of that object.|$|E
25|$|Interleaving is used {{to convert}} {{convolutional}} codes from random error correctors to burst error correctors. The basic idea behind the use of interleaved codes is to jumble symbols at the receiver. This leads to randomization of bursts of received errors which are closely located <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> then apply the analysis for random channel. Thus, the main function performed by the interleaver at transmitter is to alter the input symbol sequence. At the receiver, the deinterleaver will alter the received sequence to get back the original unaltered sequence at the transmitter.|$|E

25|$|Lodge: Well, {{you are a}} {{chief of}} state. I cannot give you advice, but personally, and as a friend, and as {{somebody}} who is concerned about your health, my suggestion would be you think seriously of getting away. Now, if I can be of any help on that, I'm prepared to send my driver with an officer of mine to escort you to safety. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> get you on my jet aircraft, and I'm sure I can deliver on that. One of my officers will ride {{in the front seat}} of my limousine with the chauffeur.|$|E
25|$|Shrout’s study {{concluded}} that women who experienced negative appraisals, like self-blame and causal attribution, led to emotional distress and increased health-compromising behavior (Shrout, 2017). Studies show that men typically only experience distress from a physical or sexual affair, while women are more bothered by emotional or relational affairs. However, women are more affected than men. This is due perception (Shrout, 2017). Women perceive relationships {{as more of a}} priority and are usually more emotionally attached (Palermo, 2015). Following a study of coping differences between genders, Binghamton University and University College London researchers say it’s evolutionary <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> blame our ancestors for this.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of the Lord's Taverners and the involvement of early members can be broadly summarised by the following:"We've all got professional and sporting interests in common. So why not start a club, based at the beloved old tavern here. We can talk about our work and watch the cricket. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> try to put a few bob back into the game at the same time."Since its inception, the Lord's Taverners has developed into a membership charity. For the first fifteen years, the NPFA was the sole beneficiary of the Lord's Taverners, with the money all going to cricket projects, mostly for the installation of artificial pitches.|$|E

25|$|At {{this point}} S4, S5, and the graph are empty. We pop {{vertices}} off Sd. If the vertex were merged with another vertex in step 3, the vertex {{that it was}} merged with will already have been colored, and we assign it the same color. This is valid because we only merged vertices that were not adjacent in the original graph. If we had removed it in step 2 because it had at most 4 adjacent vertices, all of its neighbors {{at the time of}} its removal will have already been colored, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> simply assign it a color that none of its neighbors is using.|$|E
25|$|Fractional Fourier {{transform}} {{can be used}} in {{time frequency}} analysis and DSP. It is useful to filter noise, but with the condition that it does not overlap with the desired signal in the time–frequency domain. Consider the following example. We cannot apply a filter directly to eliminate the noise, but {{with the help of the}} fractional Fourier transform, we can rotate the signal (including the desired signal and noise) first. We then apply a specific filter, which will allow only the desired signal to pass. Thus the noise will be removed completely. Then we use the fractional Fourier transform again to rotate the signal back <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> get the desired signal.|$|E
25|$|This {{definition}} for addition works {{except in a}} few special cases related to the point at infinity and intersection multiplicity. The first is {{when one of the}} points is O. Here, we define P + O = P = O + P, making O the identity of the group. Next, if P and Q are opposites of each other, we define P + Q = O. Lastly, if P = Q we only have one point, thus we can't define the line between them. In this case, we use the tangent line to the curve at this point as our line. In most cases, the tangent will intersect a second point R <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> take its opposite. However, if P happens to be an inflection point (a point where the concavity of the curve changes), we take R to be P itself and P + P is simply the point opposite itself.|$|E
