Crucially, it also provided the means for quantitatively calculating the spatial consequences of those interactions. The resulting geometric algebra, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>it,</b> eventually realized the long sought goal of creating an algebra that mirrors the movements and projections of objects in 3-dimensional space.|$|E
25|$|From a {{mathematical}} point of view, he embraced infinitesimals and worked {{long on the}} mathematics of continua. He long held that the real numbers constitute a pseudo-continuum; that a true continuum is the real subject matter of analysis situs (topology); and that a true continuum of instants exceeds—and within any lapse of time has room for—any Aleph number (any infinite multitude <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>it)</b> of instants.|$|E
25|$|The {{antiseptic}} {{properties of}} phenol {{were used by}} Sir Joseph Lister (1827–1912) in his pioneering technique of antiseptic surgery. Lister decided that the wounds themselves had to be thoroughly cleaned. He then covered the wounds {{with a piece of}} rag or lint covered in phenol, or carbolic acid <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>it.</b> The skin irritation caused by continual exposure to phenol eventually led to the introduction of aseptic (anti-septic, germ-free) techniques in surgery.|$|E

25|$|In 1910, Rusk led an {{expedition}} to Mount McKinley and when he returned, they moved {{to the area of}} Grants Pass in Oregon where his parents were living. There, he helped his parents, working in their Lucky Spot gold mine. In 1912, he moved back to Washington, to the Yakima Valley. He became the editor of the Benton Independent published in Prosser, a position he held for a year before selling the paper and resuming law practice. He continued his practice until the spring of 1915 when he was appointed to a four-year term as the receiver for the United States Land Office in Yakima. During his time in the Yakima Valley, Rusk became a vocal conservationist. He was an admirer of Theodore Roosevelt and started a local campaign to get Mount Adams set aside as a national park. He felt that it was high time that it got the recognition it deserved and in 1919, he wrote the short booklet Mount Adams–Towering Sentinel of the Lower Columbia Basin, in which he laid out his case for the Yakima National Park <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>it.</b> In 1920, Rusk was {{a founding member of the}} Cascadians mountaineering club and became its first president. Later, he also served as the chairman of the outing committee. Some of his closest friends he met while a member of the club. In 1922, the members of the Cascadians presented Rusk with a Swiss ice-axe as a gift for being an inspiring leader and being the first president of the club.|$|E

He built a fourteen-room [...] "cottage", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>it,</b> {{at the edge of a}} plateau by Moodna Creek next to a sudden [...] drop into a gorge.

500|$|In 1913, {{while working}} as {{the chair of the}} {{department}} of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, Lewis read a preliminary outline of paper by an English graduate student, Alfred Lauck Parson, who was visiting Berkeley for a year. [...] In this paper, Parson suggested that the electron is not merely an electric charge but is also a small magnet (or [...] "magneton" [...] <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>it)</b> and furthermore that a chemical bond results from two electrons being shared between two atoms. [...] This, according to Lewis, meant that bonding occurred when two electrons formed a shared edge between two complete cubes.|$|E

500|$|Janáček {{was deeply}} {{influenced}} by folklore, and by Moravian folk music in particular, {{but not by}} the pervasive, idealized 19th century romantic folklore variant. He took a realistic, descriptive and analytic approach to the material. [...] Moravian folk songs, compared with their Bohemian counterparts, are much freer and more irregular in their metrical and rhythmic structure, and more varied in their melodic intervals. [...] In his study of Moravian modes, Janáček found that the peasant musicians {{did not know the}} names of the modes and had their own ways of referring to them. [...] He considered their Moravian modulation, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>it,</b> a general characteristic of this region's folk music.|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{maintained}} {{an interest in}} harmonic experiments and continued exploring new idioms throughout his career. He tempered this interest with an abhorrence of excess and kept his tendency to experiment under constant control. The more radical his harmonies became, the more he attempted to control them with strict rules—applying his [...] "musical conscience", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>it.</b> In this sense, he was both a progressive and a conservative composer. The whole tone and octatonic scales were both considered adventurous in the Western classical tradition, and Rimsky-Korsakov's use of them made his harmonies seem radical. Conversely, his care about how or when in a composition he used these scales made him seem conservative compared with later composers like Igor Stravinsky, though they were often building on Rimsky-Korsakov's work.|$|E
500|$|Howarth {{also stated}} that Todd and Marty {{suddenly}} bonding, even if reluctantly, did not make sense {{and that he could}} not, in good conscience, support Todd's redemption by continuing to play him as Todd Lord, who had become a likable character. [...] Since the rape was, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "so in-depth and so brutal", he viewed Todd and Marty doing something like having drinks with each other bizarre. Entertainment Weekly reported that One Life to Live agreed to let Howarth go on the condition he would not appear on another soap opera for twelve months. Indy Week said, [...] "Todd was partially redeemed into a self-destructive antihero who remained popular until the show's end, but his portrayer and many critics were wary of having him becoming a romantic lead." ...|$|E

[...] Clash worked with and mentored the puppeteers of Sesame Street's international co-productions. [...] He found working with the co-productions [...] "a lot of fun" [...] and [...] "very rewarding". [...] He worked on the 1985 feature film Follow That Bird.

500|$|In 1940, [...] Edmund Godfrey Burr, a Canadian {{professor}} at McGill University, serendipitously stumbled {{on the principle}} of counter-illumination, or <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "diffused-lighting camouflage". Burr had been tasked by Canada's National Research Council (NRC) to evaluate night observation instruments. With these, he found that aircraft flying without navigation lights remained readily visible as silhouettes against the night sky, which was never completely black. Burr wondered if he could camouflage planes by somehow reducing this difference in brightness. One night in December 1940, Burr saw a plane coming in to land over snow suddenly vanish: light reflected from the snow had illuminated the underside of the plane just enough to cancel out the difference in brightness, camouflaging the plane perfectly. Burr informed the NRC, who told the RCN. They realized that the technique could help to hide ships from German submarines in the Battle of the Atlantic. Before the introduction of centimetre radar, submarines with their small profile could see convoy ships before they were themselves seen. Diffused lighting camouflage might, the RCN believed, redress the balance.|$|E
500|$|Brittan {{was also}} part of a ten-member {{syndicate}} that in February 1862 attempted to formalise the ownership of another Christchurch newspaper, The Press, which had been founded in the previous year. A deed of association for [...] "The Proprietors of The Press" [...] was drafted, but surprisingly, the deed was not executed. Four months later Brittan's political colleague, James FitzGerald, who had no funds, was the sole owner [...] "through the liberality of the proprietors", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> later. Part of Brittan's interest in The Press was its declared opposition to the proposal to connect Christchurch and Lyttelton via a rail tunnel, a project that he himself was strongly opposed to. Brittan and Henry Jacobs, the first headmaster of Christchurch's first school, Christ's College, are listed as two major writers for The Press during its early years. Before mid-1863 FitzGerald had a prolonged absence from Christchurch, and Brittan became the acting editor of The Press. In 1866 the Canterbury Standard was sold at auction to The Press, which within days, on 23 April, stopped its publication.|$|E
