5|$|I {{leave it}} with this House with every confidence. I am equal to either fortune. I can see past the {{decision}} of this House either for or against me, but whether it be against me or for me, I know, {{and it is no}} vain boast to say so, for even my enemies will <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am no boaster, that there does not exist in Canada a man who has given more of his time, more of his heart, more of his wealth, or more of his intellect and power, as it may be, for the good of this Dominion of Canada.|$|E
25|$|I used {{to write}} things praising 'The Captain' and now I write {{pretty much the same}} thing, but praising Ceaușescu. I'm not a Marxist, you understand, but I have to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> like what he's doing.|$|E
25|$|He was {{possibly}} the Theban proxenos or consul for Aegina and/or Molossia, {{as indicated in}} another of his odes, Nemean 7, in which he glorifies Neoptolemus, a national hero of Aegina and Molossia. According to tradition, Neoptolemus died disgracefully {{in a fight with}} priests at the temple in Delphi over their share of some sacrificial meat. Pindar diplomatically glosses over this and concludes mysteriously with an earnest protestation of innocence"But shall my heart never <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> with words none can redeem dishonoured Neoptolemus". Possibly he was responding to anger among Aeginetans and/or Molossians over his portrayal of Neoptolemus in an earlier poem, Paean 6, which had been commissioned by the priests at Delphi and which depicted the hero's death in traditional terms, as divine retribution for his crimes.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was, and still, without {{opening the}} letter, I asked him, {{where it came}} from.|$|R
60|$|I do {{not mind}} <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was seriously upset. Under such {{conditions}} I had but one thought.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} help a slight blush as <b>I</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had never even seen the outside of one.|$|R
500|$|He {{enrolled}} as {{a medical}} student at the University of Southampton, where {{he was known as}} Andy, but failed his first-year exams. [...] Responding to claims that he was a [...] "party animal" [...] who joined his friends in [...] "getting stoned", in 2014 Choudary commented [...] "I <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn't always practising... I committed many mistakes in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{trial was}} Captain Fabbroni's finest moment. He testified in 21 {{hearings}} and his testimony filled 285 pages. He accused the police, politicians {{and even the}} judiciary of being involved with the Camorra. Alfano claimed he was innocent. [...] "I am the victim of yellow journalism," [...] he told the judge. [...] "I have been ruined by the Carabinieri. The story that I have been {{the head of the}} Camorra is a legend. I was neither its head nor its tail. I <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have committed some excesses. What youth of my social class in Naples has not?" ...|$|E
500|$|In his youth, {{influenced}} by his uncle, former Liberal Lord Mayor of Adelaide Sir Jonathan Cain, Dunstan was {{a supporter of}} the conservative Liberal and Country League (LCL) and handed out how-to-vote cards for the party at state elections. Dunstan later said of his involvement with the Liberals: [...] "I do not call it snobbery to deride the Establishment in South Australia, I <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was brought up into it, and I admit that it gave me a pain." [...] When asked of his roots, he said [...] "I'm a refugee from it and thank God for somewhere honest to flee to!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had not. I would eat, I {{would do}} anything, so that {{afterward}} {{she would tell}} me about Bertha.|$|R

500|$|Falle's pimp {{kept her}} imprisoned {{for the years}} that he prostituted her, and trafficked her across Canada to Edmonton, Vancouver, and Kelowna. Falle later said of herself and the other women in {{prostitution}} she knew, [...] "I couldn't <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was not there by choice. We couldn't live in our own skin if we admitted that. We needed {{to believe that it}} was our choice." [...] Falle's pimp told her he would marry her if she made enough money for him through prostitution. When she had made the amount of money her pimp required, she was 17 years old. The two got married that year.|$|E
500|$|Fellow Jezebel writer Jia Tolentino {{wrote an}} {{analysis}} of Erdely's story and reported on fraternity rush after the Rolling Stone article was discredited. [...] In her article Tolentino stated: [...] "Five years after I'd left the UVA Greek system, I read 'A Rape on Campus' as an outsider account about a true problem, written by someone good at cherry-picking... So {{it took me a}} day or two to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> found many of Erdely's details unrecognizable. No one says 'UVrApe'; no one I know has ever heard the Rugby Road-themed 'traditional fight song' that poetically ('fuck for 50 cents'/'panties on the fence') separated the article's sections... Jackie was lying, and railroaded into the spotlight on a story that now appears to be a PTSD-laced delusional flashback." ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{civilian}} life, Murphy was at {{odds with}} what he perceived as an innate film industry culture of phoniness, once likening his own acting career to prostitution. He was uncomfortable being an iconic war hero, and felt used because of that image. However, he often spoke of his kinship with the military, [...] "I have to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> love the damned Army. It was father, mother, brother to me for years. It made me somebody, gave me self-respect." [...] Although he was officially retired from the military {{when he died in}} a private plane crash on 28 May 1971 at Brush Mountain, near Catawba, Virginia, his ties to the military and to his home state were evident in the aftermath.|$|E
6000|$|Jordan {{looked at}} Jimmy. [...] "I don't mind <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{expected}} this," [...] he said. Then {{he turned to}} the clerk: [...] "Take our names in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't mind <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> heard a little," [...] he said. [...] "Those land-agency fellows have a {{good deal}} to account for. You're not exactly struck on Devine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The colour grew plainer in Violet's cheeks. [...] "Well," [...] she averred, [...] "that isn't so very unnatural. After all, <b>I</b> don't mind <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{wish you}} hadn't come like this." ...|$|R
500|$|The New York Times {{film critic}} Bosley Crowther noted {{the film was}} a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves. The Beatles are portrayed as likeable young lads who are {{constantly}} amazed at the attention they receive and who want {{nothing more than a}} little peace and quiet; however, {{they have to deal with}} screaming crowds, journalists who ask nonsensical questions, and authority figures who constantly look down upon them. In fact their biggest problem is McCartney's elderly, but [...] "clean" [...] grandfather, played by Wilfrid Brambell. The New Yorker critic Brendan Gill wrote: [...] "Though I don't pretend to understand what makes these four rather odd-looking boys so fascinating to so many scores of millions of people, I <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel a certain mindless joy stealing over me as they caper about uttering sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Górecki {{learned of}} an {{inscription}} scrawled {{on the wall}} of a cell in a German Gestapo prison in the town of Zakopane, which lies {{at the foot of the}} Tatra mountains in southern Poland. The words were those of 18-year-old Helena Wanda Błażusiakówna, a highland woman incarcerated on 25 September 1944. It read O Mamo, nie placz, nie. Niebios Przeczysta Królowo, Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie (Oh Mamma do not cry, no. [...] Immaculate Queen of Heaven, you support me always). The composer recalled, [...] "I have to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have always been irritated by grand words, by calls for revenge. Perhaps in the face of death I would shout out in this way. But the sentence I found is different, almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble; she is seeking comfort and support in simple, short but meaningful words". He later explained, [...] "In prison, the whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud: 'I'm innocent', 'Murderers', 'Executioners', 'Free me', 'You have to save me'—it was all so loud, so banal. Adults were writing this, while here it is an eighteen-year-old girl, almost a child. And she is so different. She does not despair, does not cry, does not scream for revenge. She does not think about herself; whether she deserves her fate or not. Instead, she only thinks about her mother: because it is her mother who will experience true despair. This inscription was something extraordinary. And it really fascinated me." ...|$|E
500|$|Zaireeka {{opens with}} [...] "Okay I'll <b>Admit</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Really Don't Understand", a mantra of sorts about the {{admitted}} lack of comprehension regarding one's situation. [...] The second track, [...] "Riding to Work in the Year 2025 (Your Invisible Now)" [...] tells a science-fiction {{story about a}} man who pretends to be a secret agent in the future and imagines his own psychological demise from the stress [...] "of being the most important secret agent in the world". [...] "Thirty-Five Thousand Feet of Despair", the third song, is the tragic story of an airplane pilot who (somehow) hangs himself mid-flight. The next song, [...] "A Machine in India", is about the [...] "dull and depressing, mild insanity" [...] that the speaker's partner slips into during her menstrual cycle. Next, [...] "The Train Runs over the Camel but Is Derailed by the Gnat", is a speech by a man who {{is on the verge of}} discovery, but ends up [...] "talking himself into circles". Track six, [...] "How Will We Know? (Futuristic Crashendos)", is based on an urban legend that being exposed to high and low frequencies can cause a person to experience premonitions, and thus contains its infamously extensive frequencies that caused the band to place a warning on the album cover and inside the booklet. The seventh song, [...] "March of the Rotten Vegetables", is [...] "music for a cartoon about a group of demented vegetables". The eighth and final song, [...] "The Big Ol' Bug Is the New Baby Now", contains a spoken-word story about Coyne's dogs; the track ends the album with loud barking from each disc. On the 10th anniversary of Zaireeka, Wayne Coyne made and distributed an additional 5th disc to go along with the set.|$|E
6000|$|Townshead nodded. [...] "Still, he was correct. <b>I</b> don't mind <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{looked forward}} to your visit with apprehension, but I now fancy you will not jar upon me so much as I expected." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is," [...] he said, [...] "a {{tale that}} in these days one finds some little {{difficulty}} in believing. Still, it must be <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am acquainted with one fact which appears to substantiate it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you've {{appeared}} not to mind! But let me then at last {{not fail}} of {{the luxury of}} <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> mind. Yes, I mind particularly. I may be bad, but I've a grain of gumption." ...|$|R
2500|$|Patricia Neal had {{a problem}} saying the phrase, though {{she was proud of}} the film overall. [...] "I do think it's the best science fiction film ever made, {{although}} I <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> sometimes had a difficult time keeping a straight face. Michael would patiently watch me bite my lips to avoid giggling and ask, with true British reserve, 'Is that the way you intend to play it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lakshmi's {{modeling}} {{career began}} at age twenty-one while studying abroad in Madrid, Spain, {{when she was}} discovered by an agent while sitting in a café. As she has stated, [...] "I was the first Indian model to have a career in Paris, Milan, and New York. I'm {{the first one to}} <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a novelty." [...] Lakshmi was able to pay off her college loans by working as a model and actress.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} on William F. Buckley's Firing Line program, Ervin suggested that people in public life need to have more [...] "backbone", and Buckley playfully suggested Gordon Liddy as a model to which Ervin responded, [...] "Well, Gordon Liddy has {{a little too much}} backbone. I'll have to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have a sort of sneaking admiration for a fellow like Gordon Liddy that does have an excess of backbone. His backbone exceeds his intelligence, really." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is," [...] {{said the}} scientist, [...] "a tale {{that in these}} days one finds some little {{difficulty}} in believing. Still, it must be <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am acquainted with one fact which appears to substantiate it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Overweg {{shrugged his}} shoulders. [...] "My name, which I have told you, is not Slavonic, {{and it may}} be <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was born in Bavaria. In the meanwhile, it is true <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have been sent on a mission by the Russian Government." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Señorita,’ {{he broke}} out, ‘I doubt whether that man’s {{character}} {{is what he}} wishes you to believe. His manner, when he found, and indeed when <b>I</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was following him, was not the manner of an honest man.’ ...|$|R
2500|$|... "You can't be {{mates with}} everyone," [...] Warne {{wrote in his}} 2008 book [...] Shane Warne's Century, serialised by The Times in September, [...] "and {{if there was any}} way I could knock him down to number 101 for the {{purposes}} of this book, I'd be delighted to do so. [...] But having taken on the task, I want to do it seriously, and the fact is that Ranatunga helped to put Sri Lanka on the cricket map. [...] And you know what? [...] Deep down, I'll quietly <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> rated him as a cricketer." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 12, Smith wrote a conciliatory {{letter to}} the council: [...] "I <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> [...] {{language}} beyond the rules of decorum", and declared that if the council would admit that their actions regarding the Matamoros Expedition were wrong he would reinstate them so that [...] "the two branches [...] again harmonize to {{the promotion of the}} true interests of the country". [...] Weary of the infighting and unsure who was actually in charge, Council members slowly stopped appearing. In the hopes of salvaging a government, Robinson appointed four members to an Advisory Committee. [...] Soon, this dwindled to only two members. [...] The interim government was essentially over by the end of January.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "“The Bear and the Bow” {{is a really}} {{compelling}} episode for Once Upon a Time, and I <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn’t necessarily expecting it to be. However, the separate trajectories towards heroism and self-confidence for both Merida and Gold were genuinely engrossing... The plot (The deception from Arthur) thickens, and it didn’t feel like {{part of the same}} episode {{as the rest of the}} story, considering how singularly focused it is on the Gold/Merida arcs. But it was necessary if next week’s episode is going to kick off the search for this mysterious person. So I can’t really complain about it. All in all, I thought “The Bear and the Bow” delivered, as Once Upon a Time continues what is gradually becoming one of my favorite first-halves of any season in some time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} do," [...] she muttered, [...] "if {{you wanted a}} thing, but were afraid of it? But I suppose you're never afraid!" [...] she added, mocking me. <b>I</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was {{sometimes}} afraid, and often afraid of being afraid.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Austin, with a {{trace of}} grimness. [...] "I don't think it's worth while. Mind, I'm not <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't go because the notion pleased me, and if Miss Brown wished me to, it was {{certainly}} because of Muriel Gascoyne." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] said Jimmy gravely. [...] "Nobody {{would expect}} {{anything}} else from you. <b>I</b> don't mind <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have been a}} little anxious about what Eleanor might do--but we'll change the subject. You suggested that Merril was getting into trouble?" ...|$|R
