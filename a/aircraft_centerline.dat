5|$|By late Friday night, {{they had}} laid {{out what was}} {{essentially}} a new airplane. The new design (464-49) built upon the basic layout of the B-47 Stratojet with 35 degree swept wings, eight engines paired in four underwing pods, and bicycle landing gear with wingtip outrigger wheels. A notable feature of the landing gear was the ability to pivot the main landing gear up to 20° from the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerline</b> to increase safety during crosswind landings. After {{a trip to a}} hobby shop for supplies, Schairer set to work building a model. The rest of the team focused on weight and performance data. Wells, who was also a skilled artist, completed the aircraft drawings. On Sunday, a stenographer was hired to type a clean copy of the proposal. On Monday, Schairer presented Colonel Warden with a neatly bound 33-page proposal and a 14-inch scale model. The aircraft was projected to exceed all design specifications.|$|E
2500|$|The {{resulting}} BB-1 was a biplane flying boat, {{with the}} lower wing attached {{near the top of}} the hull and the upper wing held high above, with a single Kinner C-5 radial engine mounted on the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerline</b> between the wings. [...] Wheels mounted on the sides of the hull were retracted upwards during water landings. [...] The single tailwheel was not retractable. [...] The pilot and two passengers rode in an open cockpit near the bow.|$|E
2500|$|Some tankers {{have both}} a boom {{and one or}} more {{complete}} hose-and-drogue systems. The USAF KC-10 has both a flying boom and also a separate hose and drogue system manufactured by Cobham plc. [...] Both are on the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerline</b> at {{the tail of the}} aircraft, so only one system can be used at once. [...] However, such a system allows all types of probe- and receptacle-equipped aircraft to be refueled in a single mission, without landing to install an adapter. [...] Many KC-135s and some KC-10s are also equipped with dual under-wing hose-and-drogue attachments known as Multi-point Refueling System (MPRSs) or Wing Air Refueling Pods (WARPs), respectively.|$|E
50|$|At {{least one}} aircraft, the SEPECAT Jaguar, had some {{versions}} fitted with overwing hardpoints for air-to-air missiles, {{instead of putting}} them on the wingtips. These overwing hardpoints were the same lateral from the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centerline</b> as the innermost pair of underwing hardpoints.|$|R
5|$|Weapon turrets were {{mounted at}} {{the nose and}} the middle of {{aircraft}} underbelly. The nose turret could rotate +/- 100° from the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centerline</b> and could mount either a 40mm (1.57in) grenade launcher, or a 7.62mm (0.308in) minigun. The belly turret included a 30mm (1.18in) automatic cannon with 360° of rotation. Mechanical stops prevented the belly turret from aiming at {{any part of the}} helicopter.|$|R

5000|$|The Goldeneye is a [...] "tailsitter" [...] or [...] "pogo" [...] {{machine that}} takes off and lands {{straight}} up. It is a stumpy-looking machine with four tailfins, each with landing gear on the fintip, and a wing that pivots, {{allowing it to}} be aligned with the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerline</b> in cruise flight and at a right angle to the centerline in hover flight.|$|E

5000|$|The {{sideslip}} angle, {{also called}} {{angle of sideslip}} (AOS, AoS, , Greek letter beta), is a term used in fluid dynamics and aerodynamics and aviation. It relates to {{the rotation of the}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerline</b> from the relative wind. In flight dynamics it is given the shorthand notation [...] (beta) and is usually assigned to be [...] "positive" [...] when the relative wind is coming from the right of the nose of the airplane. The sideslip angle [...] is essentially the directional angle of attack of the airplane. It is the primary parameter in directional stability considerations.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} of {{the aircraft}} is built around the cannon. The GAU-8/A is mounted slightly to the port side; the barrel in the firing location is on the starboard side at the 9 o'clock position so it is aligned with the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centerline.</b> The gun's 5-foot, 11.5-inch (1.816 m) ammunition drum can hold up to 1,350 rounds of 30mm ammunition, but generally holds 1,174 rounds. To protect the GAU-8/A rounds from enemy fire, armor plates of differing thicknesses between the aircraft skin and the drum are designed to detonate incoming shells.|$|R
50|$|Torpedo bombers first {{appeared}} {{immediately prior to}} the First World War. Generally, they carried torpedoes specifically designed for air launch, which were smaller and lighter than those used by submarines and surface warships. Nonetheless, as an airborne torpedo could weigh as much as 2000 lb, {{more than twice the}} bomb load of contemporary single-engined bombers, the aircraft carrying it usually needed to be specially designed for the purpose. Many early torpedo bombers were floatplanes, such as the Short 184 (the first aircraft to sink a ship with a torpedo), and the undercarriage had to be redesigned so that the torpedo could be dropped from the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centerline.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Because the gun's recoil {{forces could}} push the entire plane off target during firing, the weapon itself is mounted {{laterally}} off-center, {{slightly to the}} port side of the fuselage centerline, with the actively [...] "firing" [...] barrel in the nine o'clock position (when viewed {{from the front of}} the aircraft), so that the firing barrel lies directly on the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centerline.</b> The firing barrel also lies just below the aircraft's center of gravity, being bore-sighted along a line 2 degrees below the aircraft's line of flight. This arrangement accurately centers the recoil forces, preventing changes in aircraft pitch or yaw when fired. This configuration also leaves space for the front landing gear, which is mounted slightly off-center on the starboard side of the nose.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine exhaust}} is {{turned back to}} the {{longitudinal}} axis by a curved composite tailpipe. A composite tailpipe was to help get the gun recoil reaction closer to the aircraft lateral center of gravity (CG) location, the gun is sub-merged as deeply as practical into {{the right side of the}} fuselage. Also, the fuselage is not centered about the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerline,</b> but is offset to the left by three inches. This results in the firing barrel of the gun being only about 18 inches from the lateral CG. This minimizes the yaw movement caused by the recoil of the gun.|$|E
50|$|The wing is {{fitted with}} large trailing-edge slotted flaps, {{but has no}} other {{high-lift}} devices, relying on the aircraft's low wing loading to give the required short-field take-off and landing performance. The wings join at the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerline,</b> with the main spar running from wingtip to wingtip The wings house integral fuel tanks with a capacity of 3,800 litres (1,000 US gal; 840 imp gal). The aircraft has a large fin, which is swept back at an angle of 50 degrees to move the tailplane rearwards {{to compensate for the}} short rear fuselage. The horizontal tailplane itself is unswept.|$|E
50|$|Most {{currently}} operational {{vectored thrust}} aircraft use turbofans with rotating nozzles or vanes to deflect the exhaust stream. This method can successfully deflect thrust through {{as much as}} 90 degrees, relative to the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerline.</b> However, the engine must be sized for vertical lift, rather than normal flight, which results in a weight penalty. Afterburning (or Plenum Chamber Burning, PCB, in the bypass stream) is difficult to incorporate and is impractical for take-off and landing thrust vectoring, because the very hot exhaust can damage runway surfaces. Without afterburning {{it is hard to}} reach supersonic flight speeds. A PCB engine, the Bristol Siddeley BS100, was cancelled in 1965.|$|E
50|$|The Curtiss Model 55 Kingbird was an {{airliner}} built in small {{numbers in the}} United States in the early 1930s. It was a twin-engine aircraft with a fuselage derived from the single-engine Curtiss Thrush. The Kingbird had two engine nacelles mounted on the struts {{on either side of}} the fuselage that braced the wing and the outrigger undercarriage. A distinctive design feature was the aircraft's blunt nose, located behind the propeller arcs. This allowed the engines to be mounted closer to each other and to the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centerline,</b> therefore minimising asymmetrical thrust in case of an engine failure. For the same reason, the Thrush's single tailfin was replaced by twin tails on the Kingbird, and the main production model, the D-2 fitted a second horizontal stabilizer and elevator between these fins.|$|R
500|$|The {{fuel system}} {{comprises}} internal fuel tanks {{located in the}} wings and fuselage with a capacity of they are refuelled through a single point pressure refuelling system (see turbine fuel systems). Internal fuel storage can be supplemented by external fuel tanks. One [...] drop tank can be mounted on the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centerline</b> hardpoint under the fuselage and two 800-litre or [...] drop tanks can be mounted on the two inboard under-wing hardpoints. The fuel system is compatible with in-flight refuelling (IFR), allowing tanker aircraft to refuel inflight, and increasing its range and loitering time significantly. All production aircraft for the PAF are to be fitted with IFR probes. In June 2013, PAF Air Chief Marshal Tahir Rafique Butt said ground tests on the JF-17's refuelling probes had been successfully completed and the first mid-air refuelling operations would commence that summer.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engines and}} {{nacelles}} were outboard {{of the wing}} root and a short [...] "shoulder" [...] section of the wing that possessed a 4° dihedral, and were followed by {{the remainder of the}} wing which had a dihedral of 2°. The leading edge of the wing was straight and perpendicular to the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centerline.</b> The trailing edge was straight and parallel to the leading edge in the shoulder, and tapered forward 15° outboard of the nacelle. Leading edge updraft carburetor intakes were present on the wing shoulder and the root of the outer wing, with a few inches of separation from the engine nacelle itself. They were very similar in appearance to those on the F4U Corsair—thin horizontal rectangles with the ends rounded out to nearly a half-circle, with multiple vertical vanes inside to direct the airstream properly.|$|R
50|$|Some tankers {{have both}} a boom {{and one or}} more {{complete}} hose-and-drogue systems. The USAF KC-10 has both a flying boom and also a separate hose and drogue system manufactured by Cobham plc.

50|$|The Koolhoven F.K.30 Toerist {{was a small}} sport {{aircraft}} {{built in}} the Netherlands in 1927, intended for use by aeroclubs. The fuselage carried the pilot and one passenger in tandem in a bathtub-like open cockpit. The cantilever parasol wing was mounted above and behind them, with the main wheels of the fixed undercarriage directly below the wing, {{at the sides of}} the fuselage. The engine, driving a pusher propeller, was mounted on the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerline</b> at the aft portion of the wing. The conventional empennage was carried on a boom extending below the propeller arc. The wing, including engine, was designed so that it could be pivoted 90° while on the ground, allowing the aircraft to be stored and transported more easily.|$|E
5000|$|Accordingly, the NAF {{proposal}} {{consisted of}} a twin-engine flying boat which featured a hull design identical {{to that of the}} Curtiss NC-1, an armament of four flexible mounting Lewis machine guns, and four crew members. An egg-like nacelle atop the upper wing housed an additional pilot/gunner's position. Initially designated as Twin Fighter (TF), a review of the aircraft's dimensions showed that the wingspan was insufficient for a conventional two-engine layout. Thus, the Bureau of Engineering revised the engine configuration into a tractor/pusher combination mounted on the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerline.</b> This change altered the designation from Twin to Tandem fighter. The TF was designed to incorporate two Curtiss-built [...] Kirkham inline engines, however mechanical problems hindered the development of these power plants, so two [...] Hispano Suiza engines were adopted instead.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuel system}} {{comprises}} internal fuel tanks {{located in the}} wings and fuselage with a capacity of 2330 kg; they are refuelled through a single point pressure refuelling system (see turbine fuel systems). Internal fuel storage can be supplemented by external fuel tanks. One 800 litre imp gal drop tank can be mounted on the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centerline</b> hardpoint under the fuselage and two 800-litre or 1110 litre imp gal drop tanks can be mounted on the two inboard under-wing hardpoints. The fuel system is compatible with in-flight refuelling (IFR), allowing tanker aircraft to refuel inflight, and increasing its range and loitering time significantly.

5000|$|The main fuselage, or gondola, was {{centered}} on the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centerline.</b> It was, {{from the tip of}} the nose {{to the end of the}} Plexiglas tail-cone, approximately five-sixths the length of one wing (root to tip). The nose housed an evolved form of the SCR-268 Signal Corps Radar, the Western Electric Company's SCR-720A. Immediately behind the radar was the multi-framed [...] "greenhouse" [...] canopy, featuring two distinct levels, one for the pilot and a second for the gunner above and behind him, the latter elevated by approximately 6 in (15 cm). Combined with the nearly flat upper surface of the aircraft's nose, the two-tiered canopy gave the aircraft's nose a distinct appearance of three wide, shallow steps. The forward canopy in the XP-61 featured contiguous, smooth-curved, blown-Plexiglas canopy sections facing forward, in front of the pilot and the gunner. The tops and sides were framed.|$|R

50|$|A {{similarly}} {{modified version}} of the A-scope display was commonly used for air-to-air and ground-search radars, notably in AI radars and ASV radars - (Air-Surface Vessel). In this case, two receiver antennas were used in front of a common reflector, pointed slightly to the left and right of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerline.</b> Reception from both, using lobe switching, was sent to the left and right sides of a vertically oriented A-scope, and range could be measured as before. However, displacement of the target to the sides of the aircraft would result in the return being stronger on one side than the other, causing the blip on that side to be larger. This allowed the radar operator to easily indicate what direction to turn to intercept the target. These types of displays were sometimes referred to as ASV-scopes or L-scopes, although the naming was not universal.|$|E

Wells, who was also a skilled artist, completed the aircraft drawings. On Sunday, a stenographer was hired to type a clean copy of the proposal. On Monday, Schairer presented Colonel Warden with a neatly bound 33-page proposal and a 14-inch scale model. The aircraft was projected to exceed all design specifications.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} to this design over {{the more traditional}} system of placing one engine on each wing, the most important being power from two engines with the frontal area (and thus drag) of a single-engine design, allowing for higher performance. It also keeps {{the weight of the}} twin powerplants near, or on, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerline,</b> increasing the roll rate compared to a traditional twin. In addition, a single engine failure does not lead to asymmetric thrust, and in normal flight there is no net torque, so the plane is easy to handle. The choice of a full [...] "four-surface" [...] set of cruciform tail surfaces in the Do 335's rear fuselage design, included a ventral vertical fin-rudder assembly to project downwards from the extreme rear of the fuselage, {{in order to protect the}} rear propeller from an accidental ground strike on takeoff. The presence of the rear pusher propeller also mandated the provision for an ejection seat for safe escape from a damaged aircraft, and designing the rear propeller and dorsal fin mounts to use explosive bolts to jettison them before an ejection was attempted — as well as twin canopy jettison levers, one per side located to either side of the forward cockpit interior just below the sills of the five-panel windscreen's sides, to jettison the canopy from atop the cockpit before ejection.|$|E
25|$|By 1960, SAC {{had begun}} moving to {{low-level}} penetration which greatly reduced radar detection distances. At the time, SAMs were ineffective against low-flying aircraft, and interceptor aircraft had {{less of a}} speed advantage at low altitudes. The Air Force's Tactical Air Command (TAC) was largely concerned with the fighter-bomber and deep strike/interdiction roles. TAC {{was in the process}} of receiving its latest design, the Republic F-105 Thunderchief, which was designed to deliver nuclear weapons fast and far, but required long runways. A simpler variable geometry wing configuration with the pivot points farther out from the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centerline</b> was reported by NASA in 1958, which made swing-wings viable. This led Air Force leaders to encourage its use. In June 1960, the USAF issued specification SOR 183 for a long-range interdiction/strike aircraft able to penetrate Soviet air defenses at very low altitudes and high speeds. The specification also called for the aircraft to operate from short, unprepared airstrips.|$|R
5000|$|The Air Corps Mockup Board met at Northrop on 2 April 1941, {{to inspect}} the XP-61 mock-up. They {{recommended}} several changes following this review. Most prominently, the four 20 mm (.79 in) M2 cannons were relocated from the outer wings to {{the belly of the}} aircraft, clustered tightly with the forward-facing ventral [...] "step" [...] in the fuselage to accommodate them placed just behind the rear edge of the nose gear well. The closely spaced, centered installation, with two cannons stacked vertically, slightly outboard of the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centerline</b> on each side, and the top cannon in each pair only a few inches farther outboard, eliminated the inherent drawbacks of the convergence of wing-mounted guns. Without convergence, aiming was considerably easier and faster, and the tightly grouped cannons created a thick stream of 20 mm (.79 in) projectiles. The removal of the guns and ammunition from the wings also cleaned up the wings' airfoil and increased internal fuel capacity from 540 gal (2,044 l) to 646 gal (2,445 l).|$|R
50|$|The pilot sat under a large {{bubble canopy}} {{well ahead of}} {{the leading edge of}} the wings. The cockpit was {{surrounded}} by a bathtub of armor (aluminum in the prototypes, which would have been replaced by titanium if production occurred) while the wing-mounted fuel tanks were self-sealing and filled with foam to minimize the potential for fires or massive fuel loss. Dual redundant hydraulic flight control systems were fitted, with a further manual backup to prevent a single hit from causing control failure. These design features were hoped to reduce combat losses by as much as 90% in Vietnam-type operations. A single 30mm Gatling gun was to be fitted in the belly of the aircraft, with the gun barrels extending under the nose. As the gun was mounted on the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centerline,</b> the undercarriage nosewheel was offset 1 ft to the left. As the GAU-8 Avenger cannon was not ready, both the YA-9 prototypes (as well as the two YA-10s) were instead fitted with the smaller 20mm M61 Vulcan. Ten underwing hardpoints were fitted, allowing up to 16000 lb of weapons, including bombs and AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missiles, to be carried.|$|R
40|$|GeoSAR is a dual {{frequency}} airborne radar interferometric mapping instrument designed to obtain high resolution and high accuracy digital elevation models. The X-band inteferometric antennas are mounted beneath the fuselage with a separation distance of 2. 6 m. Midway between the antennas along the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerline</b> {{is a large}} fairing housing the Laser Baseline metrology System (LBMS) and Inertial Navigtion Units (INUs). The P-band antennas are mounted in wingtip pods approximately 10 m from the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerline.</b> Multipath signals reflected from the LBMS fairing cause phase distortions corrupting the topograhic height measurements for both the X-band and P-band systems. In addition multipath off the wing affects the P-band phase measurements. In this {{paper we discuss a}} technique used to mitigate the amount of X-Band multipath and methods calibrating and correcting the phase for both X-Band and P-Band using a high accuracy DEM. Height differences between the interferometrically derived elevations and a photogrammetrically derived DEM are converted into phase differences. Multipath phase errors are sinusoidal with spatial frequency and amplitude related to the magnitude of reflection of the multipath reflection point and its distance from the interferometric antennas. These phase residuals are fitted using a Chebyshev polynomial sequence and used as a phase screen in the processor to correct the phase prior to height reconstruction. Based on the correction signal it is possible to estimate the location and magnitude of the multipath signal. This information can then be used to extend the domain of the phase screen over mapping angles not covered during the calibration passes. Keywords: SAR,interferometry,phase scree...|$|E
40|$|A device which corrects {{aerodynamic}} spin {{is described}} wherein a parachute exerts antispin forces on an aircraft to effect spin recovery. The dual parachute towlines and are each {{attached to the}} parachute and {{are attached to the}} rear fuselage equidistant to and {{on opposite sides of the}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerline.</b> As the parachute is deployed during spin, the parachute force acts through only the towing and exerts its force outboard of center on the aircraft. As a result, the parachute exerts not only an antispin torque, but additionally causes the aircraft to roll, creating a gyroscopic antispin rolling moment. The additional antispin rolling moment facilitates spin recovery by permitting a relatively smaller parachute to accomplish spin recovery equivalent to that of a larger parachute attached to the center of the rear fuselage...|$|E
40|$|A pair of spaced slots, {{disposed}} on {{each side}} of an <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerline</b> and spaced well inboard of the wing leading edges, are provided in the wing upper surfaces and directed tangentially spanwise toward thin sharp leading wing edges of a highly swept, delta wing aircraft. The slots are individually connected through separate plenum chambers to separate compressed air tanks and serve, collectively, as a system for providing aircraft lift augmentation. A compressed air supply is tapped from the aircraft turbojet power plant. Suitable valves, {{under the control of the}} aircraft pilot, serve to selective provide jet blowing from the individual slots to provide spanwise sheets of jet air closely adjacent to the upper surfaces and across the aircraft wing span to thereby create artificial vortices whose suction generate additional lift on the aircraft. When desired, or found necessary, unequal or one-side wing blowing is employed to generate rolling moments for augmented lateral control. Trailing flaps are provided that may be deflected differentially, individually, or in unison, as needed for assistance in take-off or landing of the aircraft...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{estimates}} are presented for {{the motion of}} vortex wakes shed by multiple aircraft flying in close formation. The purpose of the theoretical {{study was to determine}} whether the spacings between adjacent aircraft in close formations could be designed so that the lift-generated vortices being trailed would move upward rather than downward. In this way, a region below the formation is produced that is free of vortices. It was found that aircraft can be arranged in formations so that the inboard wake vortices all move upward rather than downward. The two outboard vortices travel downward at a greatly reduced velocity that depends on the number of aircraft in the formation. If the desired motions are to be produced, the lateral spacings between adjacent <b>aircraft</b> <b>centerlines</b> must be between 1. 1 and 1. 5 wingspans, and the vertical spacings between - 0. 025 and - 0. 15 wingspans. Since the range of acceptable spacings is small, it is recommended that the position accuracy between aircraft in the formation be kept within about + or - 0. 01 wingspan of the center of acceptable spacings so that aircraft meandering do not cause unwanted vortex excursions. It was also found that, if the in-trail spacings between adjacent aircraft are more than 4 wingspans, the foregoing vertical spacings must be adjusted to allow for the additional downward travel of the vortices shed by leading aircraft...|$|R
