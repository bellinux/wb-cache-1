The series is notable for its painted, luminous color artwork and {{for being the}} first full-scale, multi-page comics feature in a major American publication.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{joined the}} Business Executives Move for Vietnam Peace. By 1971, Shoup {{publicly}} endorsed the anti-war veteran group Vietnam Veterans Against the War. As Vietnamization had reduced {{the visibility of}} the anti-war movement, and Shoup's criticism was not as prominent in the public arena. Fulbright and other senators urged the White House {{to listen to his}} criticisms, but Shoup's broader critique of <b>American</b> <b>society</b> <b>and</b> militarism was seen as more extreme than other officers who had simply criticized the strategy of the war.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} {{conspiracy}} theorists grossly overestimate {{the influence of}} ex-Nazis and neo-Nazis on <b>American</b> <b>society,</b> <b>and</b> point out that political repression at home and imperialism abroad {{have a long history}} in the United States that predates the 20th century. Some political scientists, such as Sheldon Wolin, have expressed concern that the twin forces of democratic deficit and superpower status have paved the way in the U.S. for the emergence of an inverted totalitarianism which contradicts many principles of Nazism.|$|E

25|$|Though most Americans today {{identify}} themselves as middle class, <b>American</b> <b>society</b> <b>and</b> its culture are considerably more fragmented.

25|$|The Taconic {{came into}} being as a result due to the {{increasing}} presence of the automobile in <b>American</b> <b>society</b> <b>and</b> the demand for more public parks near crowded cities. Two separate agencies, the Taconic State Park Commission (TSPC) and Westchester County Parks Commission (WCPC), were its initial constructors, building different segments. In time a state authority would take over from them both, and then 18 years later itself yield up to its current administrator, the state Department of Transportation.|$|E

25|$|Miranda was {{encouraged}} by the U.S. government as part of Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy, designed to strengthen ties with Latin America. It was believed that performers like her would give the policy a favorable impression with the American public. Miranda's contract with 20th Century Fox lasted from 1941 to 1946, shortly after the creation (in 1940) of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. The goal of the OCIAA, based in Rio de Janeiro, was to obtain support from Latin <b>American</b> <b>society</b> <b>and</b> its governments for the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{long-range}} {{interests of}} the United States are served by communicating directly with {{the peoples of the}} world by radio. To be effective, the Voice of America must win the attention and respect of listeners. These principles will therefore govern Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts. 1. VOA will serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news. VOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive. 2. VOA will represent America, not any single segment of <b>American</b> <b>society,</b> <b>and</b> will therefore present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions. 3. VOA will present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussions and opinion on these policies.|$|E
25|$|During the First Red Scare in 1919-20 {{following}} the Russian Revolution, anti-Bolshevik sentiment quickly replaced the anti-German sentiment of the World War I years. Many politicians and government officials, {{along with a}} large part of the press and the public, feared an imminent attempt to overthrow the government of the United States and the creation of a new regime modeled on that of the Soviets. In that atmosphere of public hysteria, radical views as well as moderate dissents were often characterized as un-American or subversive, including the advocacy of labor rights and any less than complementary discussion of <b>American</b> <b>society</b> <b>and</b> its system of government. Close ties between recent European immigrants and radical political ideas and organizations fed those anxieties as well.|$|E

25|$|Historian Bernard Bailyn {{argues that}} the evangelicalism of the era {{challenged}} traditional notions of natural hierarchy by preaching that the Bible teaches {{that all men are}} equal, so that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not in his class. Kidd argues that religious disestablishment, belief in a God as the source of human rights, and shared convictions about sin, virtue, and divine providence worked together to unite rationalists and evangelicals and thus encouraged American defiance of the Empire. Bailyn, on the other hand, denies that religion played such a critical role. Alan Heimert argues that New Light antiauthoritarianism was essential to furthering democracy in colonial <b>American</b> <b>society</b> <b>and</b> {{set the stage for a}} confrontation with British monarchical and aristocratic rule.|$|E
25|$|Following {{verbal and}} {{physical}} assaults by Sierra's fellow students, her mother withdrew {{her from the}} school and, {{with the assistance of}} the American Civil Liberties Union, they initiated legal action against the headmaster and the school board. Initially unsuccessful and subject to various setbacks, these efforts eventually succeeded in overturning the school's decision not to allow the club, although the propriety of other actions by the school was upheld. Sierra briefly returned to Sissonville High in August 2002 before again withdrawing over peer harassment after less than a week. The actions and attitude of the school toward Sierra were sharply criticized in the media for what critics perceived as censorship and McCarthyism, as a dark sign of post–September 11th <b>American</b> <b>society</b> <b>and</b> its concept of freedom of speech.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{successfully}} synthesized diverse dramatic {{styles and}} {{movements in the}} belief that a play should embody a delicate balance between the individual and society, between the singular personality and the polity, and between the separate and collective elements of life. He thought himself a writer of social plays with a strong emphasis on moral problems in <b>American</b> <b>society</b> <b>and</b> often questioned psychological causes of behavior. He also built on the realist tradition of Henrik Ibsen in his exploration of the individual's conflict with society but also borrowed Symbolist and expressionist techniques from Bertolt Brecht and others. Some critics attempt to interpret his work from either an exclusively political or an exclusively psychological standpoint but fail to pierce the social veil that Miller creates in his work. Miller often stressed that society made his characters what they are and how it dictated all of their fears and choices.|$|E

500|$|According to Children and Television, Lesser's {{account of}} the {{development}} and early years of Sesame Street, there was little criticism of the show {{in the months following}} its premiere, but it increased {{at the end of its}} first season and beginning of the second season. Lesser put the early criticism into four categories: educational goals, how the goals were chosen and obtained, the show's possible unintended effects, and its portrayal of minorities and women. Historian Robert W. Morrow suggested that much of the early criticism, which he called [...] "surprisingly intense", stemmed from cultural and historical reasons in regards to, as he put it, [...] "the place of children in <b>American</b> <b>society</b> <b>and</b> the controversies about television's effects on them".|$|E
