500|$|The third {{ball was}} revamped again in 1995 for 1996, adding a {{computerized}} lighting system with 180 halogen bulbs and 144 strobe lights, and over 12,000 rhinestones. Lighting designer Barry Arnold {{stated that the}} changes were [...] "something [...] {{had to be done}} to make this event more spectacular <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> millennium." ...|$|E
500|$|A promotional {{video for}} the tour was {{released}} in September 2009. West posted the video on his blog accompanied by the text, [...] "What happened to all the rock stars? The fame killed them!" [...] The 30-second clip features slow-motion footage of a topless Gaga being carried by a man presumed to be West. Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone described it as [...] "soft 70s porn", while adding that he had [...] "no idea what [...] {{has to do with}} the 30-second clip, but we're sure it'll start to make more sense as more promos roll out <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> tour's launch." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} {{positive}} review: [...] "It's deals and betrayal on Once Upon a Time <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> final two weeks of Season 5. So it's fitting, naturally, that we pick up with Emma (and everyone else) asking WHAT?" ...|$|E

60|$|We {{said no more}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> light, {{but made}} softly for the door. I laid my hand upon the latch; and {{whispering}} Steerforth to keep close to me, went in.|$|R
6000|$|Reverend Finch was {{suffering}} under a second suspension of speech. All {{he could say}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> door of the silent and solitary building--and he said that with extreme difficulty--was, [...] "Pray let us be careful!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Paradoxically, {{dimensional}} analysis {{can be a}} useful tool even if all the parameters in the underlying theory are dimensionless, e.g., lattice models such as the Ising model {{can be used to}} study phase transitions and critical phenomena. Such models can be formulated in a purely dimensionless way. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> critical point closer and closer, the distance over which the variables in the lattice model are correlated (the so-called correlation length, [...] ) becomes larger and larger. Now, the correlation length is the relevant length scale related to critical phenomena, so one can, e.g., surmise on [...] "dimensional grounds" [...] that the non-analytical part of the free energy per lattice site should be [...] where [...] is the dimension of the lattice.|$|E

60|$|More {{and more}} {{beautiful}} grows the scene <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> Rhone--the river broader, hills more commanding, and architecture tinged with the Italian. Bradshaw says it equals the Rhine.|$|E
50|$|Continued {{growth in}} demand for student places at the College has meant that an {{additional}} English teaching block containing six classrooms, new Special Needs Accommodation, an additional Laboratory and a new Art and Design room were opened <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> millennium.|$|R
60|$|It {{can well}} be {{supposed}} that we held our peace <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> point {{and heard the}} cries of the sentinels on the shore, and I believed of a verity that we could not put the skiff aground without being halted.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{not exactly}} a fashionable promenade," [...] said Barbel, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> house, [...] "but in some respects {{it reminds me of the}} streets in Italian towns, where the palaces lean over toward each other in such a {{friendly}} way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, sir," [...] he said, [...] "we {{may fall}} in with peasants, or be {{challenged}} by sentries, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> battery, and {{my ability to}} speak Spanish might be an advantage." ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> present age {{we still}} find {{wonderful}} narrations about archers. Robin Hood, for instance, {{was a great}} fellow with the bow. It is said that on one occasion he shot an arrow so that it fell a mile {{from where he was}} standing! A long shot, and hard to be equalled by the crack rifles of the present day.|$|E
6000|$|Suppose {{the various}} kinds of land to be {{represented}} by the [...] alphabet; that those below O pay no agricultural rent, and that [...] all lands increase in fertility and situation <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> [...] beginning of the alphabet, but which, as far up as K, are used in [...] agriculture; that higher than K all are more profitably used for [...] building purposes, viz.: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To the seats, some of you!" [...] I cried <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> arena's barrier wall. [...] "Ten of us {{can take}} the throne," [...] for I had seen that Issus' guards had {{for the most part}} entered the fray within the arena.|$|R
60|$|Our course {{had been}} altered, and <b>we</b> were rapidly <b>approaching</b> what {{appeared}} to be a precipitous headland. Cliffs, seemingly rising perpendicularly out of the sea, faded away into the mist upon either hand <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached.</b> <b>The</b> land before us might have been a continent, so mighty appeared the shoreline; yet we knew that we must be thousands of miles from the nearest western land-mass--New Zealand or Australia.|$|R
60|$|Thus it {{was that}} I went more slowly <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> barrier, for it was my {{intention}} to move cautiously by day over the ice-pack that I might discover, before I had run into a trap, if there really lay an inhabited country at the north pole, for there only could I imagine a spot where Matai Shang might feel secure from John Carter, Prince of Helium.|$|R
60|$|Accept {{this then}} for a {{universal}} law, that neither architecture nor any other noble work of man can be good unless it be imperfect; and let us {{be prepared for the}} otherwise strange fact, which we shall discern clearly <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> period of the Renaissance, that the first cause of the fall of the arts of Europe was a relentless requirement of perfection, incapable alike either of being silenced by veneration for greatness, or softened into forgiveness of simplicity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a {{syllable}} must be uttered," [...] {{said the}} captain, raising {{a hand in}} remonstrance. [...] "I will lead, and Wyandotté will march by my side, and give me his council, in whispers. Joyce will bring up the rear. Blodget, you will keep a sharp look-out to the left, while Jamie {{will do the same}} to the right. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> mills, stragglers may be met in the woods, and our march must be conducted with the greatest caution. Now follow, and be silent." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{length of}} this {{prolonged}} day in summer, and this dreary night in winter, depends, of course, upon latitude. The length of both increases <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> poles. The long daylight in summer is exceedingly delightful. We once saw the sun describe an almost unbroken {{circle in the}} sky for many days and nights, and had we been a few degrees further north we should have seen it describe an entire circle. As it was, it only disappeared for twenty minutes. It set about midnight, and in twenty minutes it rose again {{so that there was}} no night, not even twilight, but a bright, beautiful blazing day, for several weeks together.|$|E
60|$|The {{trip down}} the river was {{exceedingly}} interesting. The stream grew narrower <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> coast range, and became at last very dangerous for a heavy boat such as the Strathcona was. We were forced to lay by at last, some fifty miles down, {{on account of the}} terrific wind which roared in through the gap, making the steering of the big boat through the cañon very difficult.|$|R
60|$|The wind, {{which had}} {{hitherto}} carried us along with amazing rapidity, sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled {{the water and}} caused a pleasant motion among <b>the</b> trees <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. The sun sank beneath the horizon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> landed, and <b>as</b> I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me forever.|$|R
2500|$|In The Winning Way Dwyer writes that, [...] "I {{certainly}} did not mark him down as someone liable {{to break into the}} Test side. Although [...] Moon had withdrawn, two other wingers of proven ability were going on the New Zealand tour, Peter Grigg and Mick Martin... Campese played in a couple of the early tour matches, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> first Test a few of the senior players tried to advance his cause by telling me how much they admired him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That {{would be}} plenty,” Stephen said. “My {{idea is that}} you might fasten {{the end of the}} rope to an arrow and shoot it among the trees. It might not catch the first time, but no doubt it would after a few trials. The rope will, of course, be coiled up so as to pay out easily, and we could pull it in or pay it out as we went round and round. Each time <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> shore, we could pull on it a little and edge the raft a few feet out, {{slackening}} out again as we came to the nearest point to the trees. If there were any logs in our way of course we should not pull; thus, by choosing our opportunity, we might get her out little by little till we are outside the full force of the stream.” ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is found}} at last {{that both the}} {{existence}} of Egypt itself, and its strange insulation {{in the midst of}} boundless tracts of dry and barren sand, depend upon certain remarkable results of the general laws of rain. The water which is taken up by the atmosphere {{from the surface of the}} sea and of the land by evaporation, falls again, under certain circumstances, in showers of rain, the frequency and copiousness of which vary very much in different portions of the earth. As a general principle, rains are much more frequent and abundant near the equator than in temperate climes, and they grow less and less so <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> poles. This might naturally have been expected; for, under the burning sun of the equator, the evaporation of water must necessarily go on with immensely greater rapidity than in the colder zones, and all the water which is taken up must, of course, again come down.|$|E
60|$|So soon; however, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> {{higher and}} more fully {{developed}} groups, we see indications of the often repeated extinction of lower by higher forms. This {{is shown by}} the great gaps that separate the mammalia, birds, reptiles, and fishes from each other; while the lowest forms of each are always few in number and confined to limited areas. Such are the lowest mammals--the echidna and ornithorhynchus of Australia; the lowest birds--the apteryx of New Zealand and the cassowaries of the New Guinea region; while the lowest fish--the amphioxus or lancelet, is completely isolated, and has apparently survived only by its habit of burrowing in the sand. The great distinctness of the carnivora, ruminants, rodents, whales, bats, and other orders of mammalia; of the accipitres, pigeons, and parrots, among birds; and of the beetles, bees, flies, and moths, among insects, all indicate {{an enormous amount of}} extinction among the comparatively low forms by which, on any theory of evolution, these higher and more specialised groups must have been preceded.|$|E
50|$|According to the 1902 Eprigian (or Eprikian) encyclopaedia, {{its origins}} are in early Armenian Christianity, {{from around the}} 4th century CE.According to {{tradition}} the main church of this monastery was built by the Apostle St. Thaddeus. The adjacent second church was built by Gregory the Illuminator 300. There is a spring beneath the church which appears {{a short distance away}} from the monastery, hence the name of the monastery, Sourp Aghprig Spring. We saw this spring <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> monastery.|$|R

60|$|The basin {{in which}} the Crisis lay was entirely fringed with forest. The trees in most places even {{overhung}} the water, forming an impenetrable screen to everything inland, at the season {{when they were in}} leaf. Not a sign of a habitation of any sort was visible; and, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> shore, Marble remarked that the savages could only resort to the place at the moments when they had induced a ship to enter, in order to trade with them.|$|R
60|$|It is the {{frequency}} of the latter kind of change, and the comparatively simple nature of the laws governing the simultaneous alterations of appearances in such cases, that have made it possible to treat a physical object as one thing, and to overlook {{the fact that it is}} a system of particulars. When a number of people at a theatre watch an actor, the changes in their several perspectives are so similar and so closely correlated that all are popularly regarded as identical with each other and with the changes of the actor himself. So long as all the changes in the appearances of a body are thus correlated there is no pressing prima facie need to break up the system of appearances, or to realize that the body in question is not really one thing but a set of correlated particulars. It is especially and primarily such changes that physics deals with, i.e. it deals primarily with processes in which the unity of a physical object need not be broken up because all its appearances change simultaneously according to the same law--or, if not all, at any rate all from places sufficiently near to the object, with in creasing accuracy <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> object.|$|E
60|$|We ought, when {{speaking}} of their stratification, to have noticed another great law, which must, however, be understood with greater latitude of application {{than any of}} the others, as very far from imperative or constant in particular cases, though universal in its influence on the aggregate of all. It is that the lines by which rocks are terminated, are always steeper and more inclined to the vertical <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> summit of the mountain. Thousands of cases {{are to be found in}} every group, of rocks and lines horizontal at the top of the mountain and vertical at the bottom; but they are still the exceptions, and the average out of a given number of lines in any rock formation whatsoever, will be found increasing in perpendicularity as they rise. Consequently the great skeleton lines of rock outline are always concave; that is to say, all distant ranges of rocky mountain approximate more or less to a series of concave curves, meeting in peaks, like a range of posts with chains hanging between. I do not say that convex forms will not perpetually occur, but that the tendency of the majority will always be to assume the form of sweeping, curved valleys, with angular peaks; not of rounded convex summits, with angular valleys. This structure is admirably exemplified in the second vignette in Rogers's Italy, and in Piacenza.|$|E
6000|$|An immense mass of nonsense, copied in one [...] "authority" [...] from another, {{was thrown}} {{before the public}} by books upon diet, until the [...] "Physiology of Common Life" [...] (George Henry Lewes) {{discussed}} Liebig's brilliant error in considering food chemically, and not physiologically. The rest assume his classification without reserve, and work from the axiom that heat-making, carbonaceous and non-nitrogenous foods (e.g. fat and sugars), necessary to support life in the arctic and polar regions, must be exchanged for the tissue-making, plastic or nitrogenous (vegetables), <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> equator. They are right {{as far as the}} southern temperates, their sole field of observation; they greatly err in all except the hot, dry parts of the tropics. Why, a Hindoo will drink at a sitting a tumbler of glí (clarified butter), and the European who would train for wrestling after the fashion of Hindostan, as I attempted in my youth, on [...] "native" [...] sweetmeats and sugared milk, will be blind with [...] "melancholia" [...] in a week. The diet of the negro is the greasiest possible, witness his [...] "palm- oil chop" [...] and [...] "palaver sauce;" [...] his craving for meat, especially fat meat, is a feeling unknown to Europe. And how simple the reason. Damp heat demands almost as much carbon as damp or dry cold.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} we were off betimes to avoid the heat, and reached Ludwigsberg to breakfast. Here the scene began to change. Troops were at drill in a meadow, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> town, and the postilion pointed out to us a portly officer at the Duke of Wurtemberg, a cadet of the royal family, who was present with his staff. Drilling troops, from time immemorial, has been a royal {{occupation}} in Germany. It is, like a Manhattanese talking of dollars, a source of endless enjoyment.|$|R
60|$|To {{my great}} joy I saw, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached,</b> that <b>the</b> girl who stooped to kindle {{the fire was}} Waboose. Her mother sat on a bank near her, looking very pale and worn.|$|R
60|$|On the {{appointed}} day--I {{think it was}} the next day, but no matter--Traddles and I repaired to the prison where Mr. Creakle was powerful. It was an immense and solid building, erected at a vast expense. I could not help thinking, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> gate, what an uproar would {{have been made in the}} country, if any deluded man had proposed to spend one half the money it had cost, on the erection of an industrial school for the young, or a house of refuge for the deserving old.|$|R
