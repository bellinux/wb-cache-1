40|$|Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic and {{corrosive}} in nature, gas {{should be}} safely {{removed from the}} biogas streams before subjecting into the fuel cell. Fe 3 + doped magnesium oxide was synthesized using sol-gel technique and dip coating process of Fe 3 + doped MgO on foam ceramic honeycomb. XRD and SEM indicate that Fe 3 + in Fe 3 + doped MgO on foam ceramic honeycomb catalyst is finely dispersed in the MgO support. Performance of the synthesized Fe 3 + doped magnesium oxide on the honeycomb catalyst was examined for hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) oxidation by double packed column scrubbers. The absorption column was used for H 2 <b>S</b> <b>scrubbing</b> from biogas by deionized water absorption and catalytic column was used as catalyst bed for degradation of absorbed H 2 <b>S</b> in <b>scrubbing</b> water.
