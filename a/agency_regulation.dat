2500|$|The Bill is modelled, {{more or less}} directly, on the {{proposals}} put forward by the European Commission for a draft Temporary and Agency Worker Directive (...) [...] This proposal was itself shelved, because of the UK government's consistent opposition to <b>agency</b> <b>regulation,</b> {{in the interests of}} labour market flexibility. According to newspaper reports, the UK got the backing of Germany to torpedo the draft Directive in return for the UK to help sink the Takeover Directive (Germany has comprehensive agency work regulation under its [...] and its Civil Code, esp §622, and the UK has strong Takeover Regulation, especially Rule 21 of the City Code). The significant difference between the proposed Directive and the Bill is that the former UK government managed to insert a 6 week qualification period in the Directive before the equal treatment rights click in (Art. 5(4)). The Bill has no proposed qualification period, though voices in the City have been calling for this to be one year. The latest reports suggest a 12 week qualifying period has been agreed between the private MP backers and the government, meaning a significant step back from the protection the Directive would offer. The Directive included equal treatment only for pay, hours, parental rights and anti-discrimination (Art. 3(1)(d)). A significant omission therefore was any regulation on reasonable notice before dismissal (in the UK, ERA s.86).|$|E

Senior aid agency representatives often strongly rejected claims that they talked with Al-Shabaab, while aid workers working in Al-Shabaab controlled areas often reported they directly negotiated with the group out of necessity.|$|E

5000|$|S. 559 was {{introduced}} in the Senate on January 15, 1965, by Senator Warren G. Magnuson (D-WA), which required cigarette packages to bear the statement: “Warning: Continual Cigarette Smoking May be Hazardous to Your Health.” The bill also removed a threat to tobacco interests by prohibiting any other health warning by federal, state, or local entities for a period of time. Representative Walter Rogers (D-TX) introduced H.R. 3014 in the House. It was similar to S. 559; however, instead of a three-year moratorium on federal <b>agency</b> <b>regulation</b> of labeling and advertising, the House bill permanently banned the Federal Trade Commission or other federal agency action concerning health warnings.|$|E
50|$|Wyeth's {{argument}} also misconstrues {{the capacity}} of agencies to preempt state law, as Wyeth's argument relies on the preamble to a 2006 FDA regulation declaring that state-law failure-to-warn claims threaten the FDA's statutorily prescribed role. Although an <b>agency</b> <b>regulation</b> {{with the force of}} law can pre-empt conflicting state requirements, this case involves no such regulation but merely an agency's assertion that state law is an obstacle to achieving its statutory objectives. Where, as here, Congress has not authorized a federal agency to pre-empt state law directly, the weight this Court accords the agency's explanation of state law's impact on the federal scheme depends on its thoroughness, consistency, and persuasiveness, e.g. Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134. Under this standard, the FDA's 2006 preamble does not merit deference: It is inherently suspect in light of the FDA's failure to offer interested parties notice or opportunity for comment on the pre-emption question; it is at odds with the available evidence of Congress' purposes; and it reverses the FDA's own longstanding position that state law is a complementary form of drug regulation without providing a reasoned explanation.|$|E

5000|$|Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission, 512 U.S. 622 (1994), is {{the first}} of two United States Supreme Court cases dealing with the must carry rules imposed on cable {{television}} companies. Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission (II), 520 U.S. 180 (1997) was the second. Turner I established that cable television companies were indeed First Amendment speakers but didn't decide whether the federal regulation of their speech infringed upon their speech rights. In Turner II the court decided that the must carry provisions were constitutional. Under the Miami Herald v. Tornillo case, it was unconstitutional to force a newspaper to run a story the editors would not have included absent a government statute because it was compelled speech which could not pass the strict scrutiny of a compelling state interest being achieved with the least restrictive means necessary to achieve the state interest. However, under the rule of Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC the High Court held that a federal agency could regulate broadcast stations (TV and Radio) with far greater discretion. In order for federal <b>agency</b> <b>regulation</b> of broadcast media to pass constitutional muster, it need only serve an important state interest and need not narrowly tailor its regulation to the least restrictive means.|$|E

A significant omission therefore was any regulation on reasonable notice before dismissal (in the UK, ERA s.86).|$|E

5000|$|... “The {{immediate}} {{public reaction}} to Grimaud adopted {{the same view}} of the case.” The public, in general, agreed with the Supreme Court’s decision. While some of the shepherds may have hoped for more freedom to graze, their hopes weren’t very high so news of Grimaud’s loss in court wasn’t that unexpected. The day after the Court’s decision, James Wilson said {{that as a result}} of Grimaud’s case, the controversy “regarding the right to use grazing lands within the various national forests without permit from the department of agriculture will be brought to an end.” This prediction was exactly correct. In 1911, the Department of Agriculture informed Congress that “the uncertainty and unrest caused by the widespread impression that the grazing regulations were not enforceable ceased immediately.” Prior to United States v. Grimaud, shepherds and farmers in California had no real reason to fear the rangers patrolling the national forest. However, after the ruling that the rangers’ power was constitutional, the shepherds and farmers respected their authority. While the case of Grimaud v. United States was only explicitly mentioned in Light v. United States (another case of trespassing forest grounds protected by the US government), it more clearly defined what Congress could do: “it could delegate power to an agency to adopt regulations subject to criminal penalties, provided that Congress itself legislated the penalties. Moreover, because criminal sanctions are the most severe type of sanction for violating an <b>agency</b> <b>regulation,</b> there was little doubt after Grimaud that Congress could provide other types of sanctions for violating agency regulations as well. Grimaud established that Congress can delegate authority to agencies to promulgate regulations that have a variety of legal consequences - as long as Congress itself spells out by statute what those consequences are.” Before the dispute between Pierre Grimaud and the United States government, there was a gray area surrounding this aspect of the central government’s power. United States v. Grimaud permanently and clearly defined the extent of their power.|$|E

40|$|Prophets of Regulation by Thomas K.

McCraw supports his hypothesis with the life stories of four men, each from a different era, each responsible for different regulatory efforts—Charles Francis Adams, appointed one of the first members of the Massachusetts Board of Railroad Commissioners in 1869; Louis D. Brandeis, a strong proponent of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), created in 1914; James M. Landis, chief drafter of the 1933 and 1934 legislation regulating the securities industry and commissioner of the FTC, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB); and finally, Alfred E.
