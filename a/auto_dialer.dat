50|$|An {{automatic}} dialer (<b>auto</b> <b>dialer,</b> auto-dialer, autodialler) is an electronic device or software that automatically dials telephone numbers. Once the call has been answered, the autodialer either plays a recorded message or connects {{the call to}} a live person.|$|E
50|$|When a user is {{browsing}} using {{a mobile}} phone, CTC features {{tend to be}} more literal. Phone numbers are highlighted in the same manner a hyperlink would be. Clicking the phone number begins the calling process. Similar to the <b>Auto</b> <b>Dialer</b> mode, this would be the same as the end user pressing each digit to call the other number, except that this is a short cut of pressing just the highlighted number once.|$|E
50|$|Of course many {{devices are}} being used illegitimately all over the world. There are some {{companies}} and individuals however who use them to commit fraud and perpetrate scams on unwitting recipients, often the elderly, or those unaware of their rights. In this event the existence of government 'Do Not Call' registers or lists has little effect on their operations. In order to try and control what is a growing business, organizations have attempted to create codes of practice for those operating in their industry which may make use of <b>auto</b> <b>dialers.</b>|$|R

Voice Elements {{was released by}} Inventive Labs Corporation in 2008, based on their original CTI32 toolkit. Software developers who use C#, VB.NET or Delphi use Voice Elements to write telephony-based applications, such as Interactive Voice Response systems, voice <b>dialers,</b> <b>auto</b> attendants, call centers and more.|$|R
50|$|In November 2006, Google {{experimented with}} a {{callback}} process in its Google Maps product but eventually removed the feature. As of January 2008, Google is testing click-to-call for businesses listed in search result pages 2. Some people {{have indicated that}} such failure {{is due to the}} fact that Google is using the CTC in the <b>Auto</b> <b>Dialer</b> mode, providing very little benefits to the end users. Other vendors who provide Callback mode fare differently such as Ingenio was acquired by AT&T Yellow Pages and eStara was acquired by ATG.|$|E
50|$|The list of {{services}} to be monitored at a Central Station has expanded {{over the past few}} years to include: Access Control; CCTV Monitoring; Alarm Verification; Environmental Monitoring; Intrusion Alarm Monitoring; Fire Alarm & Sprinkler Monitoring; Critical Condition Monitoring; Medical Response Monitoring; Elevator Telephone Monitoring; Hold-Up or Panic Alarm Monitoring; Duress Monitoring; <b>Auto</b> <b>Dialer</b> tests; Open & Close Signal Supervision & Reporting; Exception Reports; and PIN or Passcode Management. Increasingly, the Central Stations are making this information available directly to end users via the internet and a secure log-on to view and create custom reports on these events themselves.|$|E
40|$|The Automatic Dialing system {{purchased}} by D 0 {{is intended to}} help make the D 0 cryogenic system operate unattended by cryogenic operating personnel. The <b>auto</b> <b>dialer</b> is completely programmable and is voice synthesized. The <b>auto</b> <b>dialer</b> was purchased with 32 bistable inputs, but is expandable to 64 bistable inputs with the purchase of more electronic cards at an approximate cost of $ 260 per card (8 bistable inputs). The <b>auto</b> <b>dialer</b> also has the capability for analog inputs, analog outputs, and bistable outputs none of which D 0 uses or intends to use. The <b>auto</b> <b>dialer</b> can be called on its operating phone line to describe current alarms with the proper password. The <b>Auto</b> <b>Dialer</b> can dial lab extensions, lab pagers, and any number outside the lab. It cannot dial a long distance pager. The <b>auto</b> <b>dialer</b> monitors alarms and alarm conditions via the T 1565 PLC, upon an alarm condition it initiates a phone calling sequence of preprogrammed lists with assigned priorities. When someone is reached, the <b>auto</b> <b>dialer</b> describes the individual alarm it is calling for, by a preprogrammed set of words for that individual alarm, spoken by a female voice. The called person then has a chance to acknowledge the alarm over the telephone, if the alarm is not acknowledged the <b>auto</b> <b>dialer</b> will disconnect and call the next person on the list. The <b>auto</b> <b>dialer</b> will continue to cycle through the list until it is acknowledged, reset, or the alarm condition no longer exists...|$|E
40|$|Smoke Detectors/Alarms {{save the}} lives of over sixty percent of people each year in the United States. Most of the {{existing}} homes are still fitted with the normal smoke detectors either running out of the 120 V ac wiring or out of a 9 V dc battery. These alarms are perfectly fine to alert residents if there is a fire while they are home. But for people who are away from home when a fire occurs, {{it would be nice if}} they could be alerted automatically of such an occurrence and therefore be able to act upon the event by either calling the fire department, police or a neighbor to check on their house. With this in mind, the idea to build a smoke detector/alarm system that could alert a homeowner while he is away from home came about. This system is a wireless smoke detector/alarm system that will make an automatic phone call via POTS if an alarm is triggered by smoke from a fire. Upon smoke detection, the alarm will communicate the event to an Access Point wirelessly which in turn will trigger an <b>auto</b> <b>dialer</b> with preprogrammed phone numbers and a message to automatically call each of the numbers and relay the preprogrammed phone message...|$|E
40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{describes how}} exhaust fan 6 (EF- 6) and exhaust fan 7 (EF- 7) are controlled and monitored. Since these two fans are a vital {{link in the}} ODH safety system, they will be monitored, controlled and periodically operated by the programmable logic controller (PLC). If {{there should be a}} fault in the ventilation system, the PLC will print a warning message to the cryo control room printer and flash a descriptive warning on the ODH/ventilation graphics page. This fault is also logged to the Xpresslink graphics alarm page and to an alarm history hard disk file. The ventilation failure is also an input to the <b>auto</b> <b>dialer</b> which will continue it's automatic sequence until acknowledged. EF- 6 delivers 13000 C. F. M. and is considered emergency ventilation. EF- 7 delivers 4500 C. F. M. and will run 24 hrs a day. Both ventilation fans are located in an enclosed closet in the TRD gas room. Their ductwork, both inlets and outlets run along side the pipe chase, but are separated by an airtight wall. Their combination motor control starter cabinets are located in the TRD room in plain visible sight of the fans with the closet door open. The fans have signs that state they are automatically controlled and can energize at any time...|$|E
