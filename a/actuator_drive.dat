40|$|This work {{pertains}} to the development effort involved in the deployment of an additional winglike aerodynamic surface {{referred to as a}} “mousche” for the naval version of a typical military aircraft. The mousche is attached to the forebody of the naval aircraft. It is deployed only during landing (and retracted at all other times) in order to improve the landing characteristics of the aircraft on the aircraft carrier. The mousche is designed and constructed out of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic to withstand the full load and is deployed using the actuator bank containing the arrays of shape memory alloy elements. The shape memory alloy actuator bank moves a distance of 15 mm while generating a net actuator force of over 2000 kg. This force is used to deploy the additional aerodynamic surface measuring 790 � 215 � 32 mmagainst a simulated lift and drag load acting simultaneously, i. e., a resultant lift load of 331. 6 kg and a drag load of 33. 16 kg acting at the center of gravity of the mousche. The shape memory alloy bank consists of 138 wires of about 1 mm in diameter and 650 mm in length. The actuation of these 138 wires is electronically and mechanically synchronized.

Controlled self-assembly and dynamic reconfiguration of large ensembles of microscopic particles can effectively bridge these domains to build in-novative systems.

This paper presents a self-sensing controlled <b>actuator</b> <b>drive</b> that was designed using antagonistic pairs of SMA wires.

Track switching provides necessary flexibility to a rail network, allowing vehicles to change routes when necessary. Track switches, however, have historically been prone to failure. To increase asset reliability, a concept for a novel design of switch has been developed which allows multi-channel actuation through a novel actuation and locking mechanism, under a project titled 'Repoint'. This paper describes a mathematical model of the operation a novel Repoint track switch. The model was derived from a first principles physical analysis of the Repoint concept design.

40|$|A {{robot system}} {{for use in}} an {{enclosed}} environment was designed and tested. The conceptual design {{will be used to}} assist in research performed by the Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) project. Design specifications include maximum load capacity, operation at specified environmental conditions, low maintenance, and safety. The robot system must not be hazardous to the sealed environment, and be capable of stowing and deploying within a minimum area of the CELSS chamber facility. This design consists of a telescoping robot arm that slides vertically on a shaft positioned {{in the center of the}} CELSS chamber. The telescoping robot arm consists of a series of links which can be fully extended to a length equal to the radius of the working envelope of the CELSS chamber. The vertical motion of the robot arm is achieved through the use of a combination ball screw/ball spline actuator system. The robot arm rotates cylindrically about the vertical axis through use of a turntable bearing attached to a central mounting structure fitted to the actuator shaft. The shaft is installed in an overhead rail system allowing the entire structure to be stowed and deployed within the CELSS chamber. The overhead rail system is located above the chamber's upper lamps and extends to the center of the CELSS chamber. The mounting interface of the actuator shaft and rail system allows the entire actuator shaft to be detached and removed from the CELSS chamber. When the actuator shaft is deployed, it is held fixed at the bottom of the chamber by placing a square knob on the bottom of the shaft into a recessed square fitting in the bottom of the chamber floor. A support boot ensures the rigidity of the shaft. Three student teams combined into one group designed a model of the CELSS chamber robot that they could build. They investigated materials, availability, and strength in their design. After the model arm and stand were built, the class performed pre-tests on the entire system. A stability pre-test was used to determine whether the model robot arm would tip over on the stand when it was fully extended. Results showed the stand tipped when 50 Newtons were applied horizontally to the top of the vertical shaft while the arm was fully extended. This proved that it was stable. Another pre-test was the actuator slip test used to determine if there is an adequate coefficient of friction between the <b>actuator</b> <b>drive</b> wheels and drive cable to enable the actuator to fully extend and retract the arm. This pre-test revealed that the coefficient of friction was not large enough to prevent slippage. Sandpaper was glued to the drive wheel and this eliminated the slippage problem. The class preformed a fit test in the CELSS chamber to ensure that the completed robot arm is capable of reaching the entire working envelope. The robot was centered in the chamber and the arm was fully extended to the sides of the chamber. The arm was also able to retract to clear the drain pipes separating the upper and lower plant trays...|$|E
