40|$|Numerous web databases, e. g., amazon. com, eBay. com, are “hid-den ” behind (i. e., {{accessible}} only through) their restrictive search and browsing interfaces. This demonstration showcases HDBTrack-er, a web-based system that reveals and tracks (the changes of) user-specified aggregate queries over such hidden web databases, espe-cially {{those that are}} frequently updated, by issuing a small num-ber of search queries through the public web interfaces of these databases. The ability to track and monitor aggregates has appli-cations over {{a wide variety of}} domains- e. g., government agen-cies can track COUNT of openings at online job hunting websites to understand key economic indicators, while businesses can track the <b>AVG</b> <b>price</b> of a product over a basket of e-commerce websites to understand the competitive landscape and/or material costs. A key technique used in HDBTracker is RS-ESTIMATOR, the first algorithm that can efficiently monitor changes to aggregate query answers over a hidden web database. 1...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{test the}} three-parameter {{symmetric}} variance gamma (SVG) option pricing {{model and the}} four-parameter asymmetric variance gamma (<b>AVG)</b> option <b>pricing</b> model empirically. Prices of the Hang Seng Index call options, which are of European style, are used as {{the data for the}} empirical test. Since the variance gamma option pricing model is developed for the pricing of European options, the empirical test gives a more conclusive answer than previous papers, which used American option data to the applicability of the VG models. The present study uses a large number of intraday option data, which span over a period of 3 years. Synchronous option and futures data are used throughout the study. Pairwise comparisons between the accuracy of model prices are carried out using both parametric and nonparametric methods. The conclusion is that the VG option pricing model performs marginally better than the Black–Scholes (BS) model. Under the historical approach, the VG models can moderately iron out some of the systematic biases inherent in the BS model. However, under the implied approach, the VG models continue to exhibit predictable biases and its overall performance in pricing and hedging is still far less than desirable. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
