40|$|Abstract. Online <b>auction</b> Web <b>sites</b> {{are fast}} {{changing}} and highly dynamic. It {{is difficult to}} digest the poorly organized and vast amount of information contained in the <b>auction</b> <b>sites.</b> We develop a unified framework aiming at automatically extracting the product features and summarizing the hot item features across different <b>auction</b> Web <b>sites.</b> One challenge of this problem is to extract useful information from the product descriptions provided by the sellers, which vary largely in the layout format. We formulate the problem as a single graph labeling problem using conditional random fields which can model the relationship among the neighbouring tokens in a Web page, the tokens from different pages, as well as various information such as the hot item features across different <b>auction</b> <b>sites.</b> We have conducted extensive experiments from several real-world <b>auction</b> Web <b>sites</b> to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{remaining}} {{tree was}} later attacked twice with chainsaws by Māori activists {{to draw attention}} to injustices they believed the New Zealand government had inflicted upon Māori (as the tree was not a native New Zealand species, they considered it an appropriate target). The first attack happened on 28 October 1994, the anniversary of the 1835 Declaration of Independence. A second attack on 5 October 2000 left the tree unable to recover even though substantial efforts were made, and so it was removed on 26 October due to the risk of it collapsing. The chainsaw used in the first attack was later placed on sale on popular New Zealand <b>auction</b> <b>site,</b> TradeMe in 2007, but later withdrawn by the website after complaints and a poll of users.

25|$|With this in mind, {{mindful of}} the {{mounting}} issues in Hartford and growing opposition to the deal, {{in the spring of}} 1999, Kraft announced that he was abandoning the Hartford stadium project. Kraft, preferring to keep the team where it was, eventually reached a mutually acceptable deal with the Massachusetts legislature for the necessary infrastructure improvements. The final hurdle the stadium needed to clear was approval by the citizens of Foxborough on six separate measures. Despite some initial hesitation regarding a proposed dedicated access road for premium ticket holders, the Patriots won approval on each measure by an over 90% majority. This cleared the way for what was originally known as CMGi Field to be built adjacent to the old stadium in Foxboro. The naming rights to the stadium were originally purchased by CMGi, an e-commerce company based in nearby Waltham, Massachusetts, which, at the time, was parent company to internet <b>auction</b> <b>site</b> uBid.|$|E
