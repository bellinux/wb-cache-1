Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills, or lifting <b>and</b> <b>waving</b> their wings in a threatening manner. Adult pelicans grunt when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively.|$|E

40|$|The {{electric}} power generation of co-located offshore wind turbines <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> energy converters along the California coast is investigated. Meteorological wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> data from the National Buoy Data Center were used to estimate the hourly power output from offshore wind turbines <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> energy converters at the sites of the buoys. The data set from 12 buoys consists of over 1, 000, 000 h of simultaneous hourly mean wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> measurements. At the buoys, offshore wind farms would have capacity factors ranging from 30 % to 50 %, <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> farms would have capacity factors ranging from 22 % to 29 %. An analysis of the power output indicates that co-located offshore wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> energy farms generate less variable power output than a wind or wave farm operating alone. The reduction in variability results from the low temporal correlation of the resources and occurs on all time scales. Aggregate power from a co-located wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> farm achieves reductions in variability equivalent to aggregating power from two offshore wind farms approximately 500 km apart or two wave farms approximately 800 km apart. Combined wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> farms in California would have less than 100 h of no power output per year, compared to over 1000 h for offshore wind or over 200 h for wave farms alone. Ten offshore farms of wind, wave, or both modeled in the California power system would have capacity factors during the summer ranging from 21 % (all wave) to 36 % (all wind) with combined wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> farms between 21 % and 36 %. The capacity credits for these farms range from 16 % to 24 % with some combined wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> farms achieving capacity credits {{equal to or greater}} than a 100 % wind farm because of their reduction in power output variability...|$|R

5|$|Camouflage {{is found}} in many butterflies. Some like the oakleaf {{butterfly}} and autumn leaf are remarkable imitations of leaves. As caterpillars, many defend themselves by freezing and appearing like sticks or branches. Others have deimatic behaviours, such as rearing up <b>and</b> <b>waving</b> their front ends which are marked with eyespots {{as if they were}} snakes. Some papilionid caterpillars such as the giant swallowtail (Papilio cresphontes) resemble bird droppings. Some caterpillars have hairs and bristly structures that provide protection while others are gregarious and form dense aggregations. Some species are myrmecophiles, forming mutualistic associations with ants and gaining their protection. Behavioural defences include perching and angling the wings to reduce shadow and avoid being conspicuous. Some female Nymphalid butterflies guard their eggs from parasitoidal wasps.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this CHETN is to examine changes in peak surge {{elevation}} <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> height due {{to changes in the}} frictional resistance of a marsh. Landscape features with vegetation have the potential to reduce storm surge elevations <b>and</b> dissipate <b>wave</b> energy. Land elevations greater than the storm surge elevation act as a physical barrier and create bathymetric resistance for the surge <b>and</b> <b>waves.</b> Landscape features such as marshes also have the potential to create frictional resistance and affect storm surge <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> energy even when below the surge elevation. This is the third in a series of technical notes on the influence of marshes on storm surge <b>and</b> <b>waves.</b> The analysis in this note isolates the sensitivity of the modeled storm surge elevation <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> height to the magnitude of bottom friction change and indicates, in a qualita-tive sense, {{the degree to which a}} marsh density may reduce storm surge elevation <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> height on the coast. The magnitude of bottom friction was systematically increased within a hypothetical marsh area to understand how marsh vegetation type and density may modify storm parameters (surge elevation <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> height) on the coast immediately landward of the marsh. METHODOLOGY: A set of idealized surge simulations using ADCIRC (Westerink et al., 1992) and STWAVE (Smith et al., 2001) were made to examine changes in storm surge elevation an...|$|R

Since the 1980 s, X-band marine radar has evolved {{as one of the}} remote sensing instruments for such purposes since its sea surface images contain considerable wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> information. The maturity and accuracy of X-band marine radar wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> measurements have already enabled relevant commercial products to be used in real-world applications.

In this review, the principles of the methodologies are described, the performances are compared, and the pros and cons are discussed.

5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling <b>and</b> <b>waving</b> only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E

In doing so Allen exposed himself and was struck by musket fire, taking a round first in the head and then in the chest. With their commander mortally wounded and their crew taking heavy casualties, the American boats withdrew, thus allowing the second pirate schooner as well as a third that had not been engaged, to escape. The vessels the pirates had seized were left behind and recovered by the Americans after the action had ended.|$|E

5|$|Adults {{aggregate}} {{in large}} numbers (>20 individuals) under rocks and logs along the immediate edge of the breeding sites and breed explosively over a few days. Suitable breeding sites include small fish-free ponds, marshes, shallow lakes and other still-water wetlands. Like other ambystomatid salamanders, they have evolved a characteristic courtship dance where they rub bodies and release pheromones from their chin gland prior to assuming a copulatory mating position. Once in position, the male deposits a spermatophore, which is a gooey stalk tipped with a packet of sperm, and walks the female forward to be inseminated. Males may mate more than once and may deposit as many as 15 spermatophores {{over the course of}} a five-hour period. The courtship dance for the long-toed salamander is similar to other species of Ambystoma and very similar to A.jeffersonianum. In the long-toed salamander, there is no rubbing or head-butting; the males directly approach females and grab on, while the females try to rapidly swim away. The males clasp the female from behind the forelimbs and shake, a behavior called amplexus. Males sometimes clasp other amphibian species during breeding and shake them as well. The male only grabs with the front limbs and never uses his hind limbs during the courtship dance as he rubs his chin side to side pressing down on the female's head. The female struggles but later becomes subdued. Males increase the tempo and motions, rubbing over the female's nostrils, sides, and sometimes the vent. When the female becomes quite docile the male moves forward with his tail positioned over her head, raised, <b>and</b> <b>waving</b> at the tip. If the female accepts the males courtship, the male directs her snout toward his vent region while both move forward stiffly with pelvic undulations. As the female follows, the male stops and deposits a spermatophore, and the female will move forward with the male to raise her tail and receive the sperm packet. The full courtship dance is rarely accomplished in the first attempt. Females deposit their eggs a few days after mating.|$|E
