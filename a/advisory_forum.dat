First, as academic researchers who have long worked {{in the field of}} science and innovation policy, albeit from different analytical and disciplinary perspectives, we seek to insure that efforts to promote the "science" of science and technology, or innovation policy produce substantive scholarly work that in fact advances our fundamental understanding of underlying processes. Second, as participants in numerous U.

The National Disaster Management Framework (NDMF) that followed in 2005 put clear guidelines in place for implementing the DMA and emphasised the importance of the integration and coordination of DRM activities in all spheres of government. To adhere to the requirements of the DMA regarding personnel, certain DRM structures like interdepartmental committees, disaster management centres, disaster management frameworks and disaster management <b>advisory</b> <b>forums</b> must be in place. Since the promulgation of the DMA in 2003, South African municipalities have had ample time to get the structures in place. This article tries to evaluate the degree to which South African municipalities adhere to the requirements of the DMA in terms of personnel. Municipalities were selected per province, and the research is based on a 20 % representative sample of all 279 municipalities in South Africa. A mixed method of research was followed. The result of this research showed a clear lack of implementation in terms of the DMA.

40|$|M. Development and Management, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Since 1994 {{fundamental}} transformation {{has taken}} place in South Africa in terms of disaster risk management. The transformation process gave rise to the promulgation of the Disaster Management Act (57 / 2002) that heralded a new era for disaster risk management in South Africa. Consequently the National Disaster Management Framework, published in 2005, set clear guidelines for the implementing of the mentioned act. The National Disaster Management Framework emphasises the importance of the integration and coordination of disaster risk management activities in all spheres of government. Die Disaster Management Act (57 / 2002) calls for the establishment or certain disaster risk management structures like interdepartmental commitees, disaster management centers, disaster management frameworks, and disaster management <b>advisory</b> <b>forums.</b> Furthermore the National Disaster Management Framework sets certain guidelines in compliance with the Disaster Management Act (57 / 2002). Municipalities in South Africa have had time since the promulgation of the act in 2003 to get all the mentioned structures in place. This study tried to deretmine the degree in which municipalities complied with the requirements of the Disaster Management Act (57 / 2002). The municipalities were handles per procvince and the research is based on a 20 % representative sample of all the municipalities in South Africa. A mixed method of research was followed. That means that qualitative (telephonic and semi-structured interviews) and quantitative (questionnaires with Likert scale questions) research was used. The result of this research is that there are big failings in terms of the implementing of the Disaster Management Act (57 / 2002) across the country. In certain provinces the situation is better than in others, but of none of the provinces {{it can be said that}} they comply with all the recuirements of the act. Master...|$|R
