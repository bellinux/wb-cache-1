500|$|In 1971, he {{released}} another well-received album, Tupelo Honey. This album produced the hit single [...] "Wild Night" [...] {{that was later}} covered by John Mellencamp. The title song has a notably country-soul feel about it and the album ended with another country tune, [...] "Moonshine Whiskey". Morrison said he originally intended to make an all country album. The recordings were as live as possible – after rehearsing the songs the musicians would enter the studio and play <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>set</b> in one take. His co-producer, Ted Templeman, described this recording process as the [...] "scariest thing I've ever seen.

[...] We would have played maybe twenty songs and Van would go back and cut out the songs he didn't want. The only time we'd go back would be to overdub backing vocals or horns."

500|$|The {{producers}} saw {{the season}} as [...] "two shows"; Wyman noted, [...] "It's on us to make the mythology over there just as compelling as the mythology here, so we will enjoy both of them. We have our characters going back and forth, there or here, but there's <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>set</b> of nice characters that you'll become very interested in very quickly. It's interesting because it gives you that gearshift." [...] Wyman later added that parallel universe plot device [...] "really allowed us to explore the characters deeper via their doppelgängers, to illuminate characters we already know. It’s been a real gas {{for all of us}} involved in making the show." [...] Historical idiosyncrasies were inserted into the parallel universe, such as a still-living John F. Kennedy, the non-existence of the FBI, and the Back to the Future franchise starring Eric Stoltz rather than Michael J. Fox. The writers loved creating an entire new world, and asked themselves what life would have been like in its most mundane forms, such as within daily routines. Pinkner thought it allowed them to create and explore many [...] "what-if" [...] moments, such as if the September 11 attacks had occurred against the White House instead of the Twin Towers, or if the Statue of Liberty still possessed its shiny copper sheen. [...] "Entrada", the eighth episode, {{was the first of the}} season to divide its time between both universes.|$|E

Hayden confirmed that he had made the request for HP servers as part of Stellar Wind, a 2001–2007 NSA warrantless surveillance program, but the details were not revealed to Fiorina at the time. Fiorina [...] "acknowledged she complied with Hayden's request, redirecting trucks of HP computer servers that were on their way to retail stores from a warehouse in Tennessee to the Washington Beltway, where they were escorted by NSA security" [...] to the agency's Fort Meade headquarters.
