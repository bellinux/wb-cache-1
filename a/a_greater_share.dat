5|$|Macdonald was {{considered}} one of his province's most eloquent political orators. He articulated a philosophy of provincial autonomy, arguing that poorer provinces needed <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>share</b> of national tax revenues to pay for health, education and welfare. He contended that Nova Scotians were victims of a national policy that protected the industries of Ontario and Quebec with steep tariffs forcing people to pay higher prices for manufactured goods. It was no accident, Macdonald said, that Nova Scotia had gone from the richest province per capita before Canadian Confederation in 1867 to poorest by the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In the East the {{situation}} was much darker for the Christians. In the Holy Land, the Second Crusade had disastrous long-term consequences for Jerusalem. In 1149, the atabeg Anur died, {{at which point the}} amir Abu Sa'id Mujir al-Din Abaq Ibn Muhammad finally began to rule. The ra'is of Damascus and commander of the ahdath milita Mu'ayad al-Dawhal Ibn al-Sufi feel that since his ahdath had {{played a major role in}} defeating the Second Crusade that he deserved <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>share</b> of the power, and within two months of Anur's death was leading a rebellion against Abaq. The in-fighting within Damascus was to lead to the end of the Burid state within five years. Damascus no longer trusted the crusader kingdom and was taken by Nur ad-Din after a short siege in 1154.|$|E
5|$|Because higher league {{placement}} {{results in}} <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>share</b> of television rights, {{success on the}} field generates greater income for the club. Since {{the inception of the}} Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB broadcasting deal. Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005–06, the club's commercial arm generated £51million, compared to £42.5million at Chelsea, £39.3million at Liverpool, £34million at Arsenal and £27.9million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company Nike, who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a £303million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015. Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services – such as the club's dedicated television channel, MUTV – have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.|$|E

5|$|In September 2014, Modi {{introduced}} the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, {{with the goal}} of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub. Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>share</b> of the Indian market. In order to enable the construction of private industrial corridors, the Modi administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it. Under the previous bill, the government had required the consent of 80% of the owners of a piece of property before acquiring it for a private project: this requirement was waived. The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse. Modi's government put in place the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017.|$|E

25|$|Murdoch {{was never}} far from controversy. His {{omission}} as wicketkeeper {{in the very first}} Test resulted in Australia's premier fast bowler, Fred Spofforth, boycotting the match. In 1884 as captain of Australia he was involved in the players' strike, where the Australian players refused to play unless they received <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>share</b> of the gate takings. He was also the batsman whose contentious run out caused friction between New South Wales and a visiting English team led by Lord Harris, which also caused a spectator riot.|$|E

25|$|North Caldwell was {{incorporated}} by {{an act of}} the New Jersey Legislature on March 31, 1898, from portions of Caldwell Township (now known as Fairfield Township). In 1982, the borough was one of four Essex County municipalities to pass a referendum to become a township, joining 11 municipalities that had already made the change. Ultimately, more than a dozen Essex County municipalities reclassified themselves as townships in order take advantage of federal revenue sharing policies that allocated townships <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>share</b> of government aid to municipalities on a per capita basis.|$|E
25|$|Commission member Henry Snell {{signed the}} report but added a Note of Reservation. Although he was {{satisfied}} that the Mufti was not directly responsible for the violence or had connived at it, he believed the Mufti {{was aware of the}} nature of the anti-Zionist campaign and the danger of disturbances. He therefore attributed to the Mufti <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>share</b> of the blame than the official report had. Snell also disagreed with the commission on matters of Jewish immigration, and did not support restrictions on Jewish land purchases. Regarding the immediate causes of the outbreak, Snell agreed with the main findings of the commission.|$|E
25|$|The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) {{estimated}} {{the size of}} an employment shortfall, defined as the number of workers below a full employment level. This shortfall steadily improved during Obama's tenure, from approximately 10 million in 2010 to 2.5 million as of December 2015, a figure roughly 1.5% of the 160 million person labor force. As the economy recovered towards full employment, a reduced labor force participation rate among prime working-aged persons (between ages 25 to 54 years old) accounted for <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>share</b> of the shortfall. The overall labor force participation rate had been falling since 2000, as the country ages.|$|E

25|$|For {{many years}} the VFL had an uneasy {{relationship}} with the MCG trustees and the Melbourne Cricket Club. Both needed the other, but resented the dependence. The VFL made the first move which brought things to a head by beginning the development of VFL Park at Mulgrave in the 1960s as its own home ground and as a potential venue for future grand finals. Then in 1983, president of the VFL, Alan Aylett started to pressure the MCG Trust to give the VFL <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>share</b> of the money it made from using the ground for football.|$|E
25|$|To improve survivability, the French Air Force began {{dispersing}} Mirage IVs to pre-prepared rough strips {{during the}} 1960s; while {{the use of}} hardened bunkers had been assessed, it {{was found to be}} financially impractical. By the 1970s, it had become clear that vulnerability of the Mirage IV to air defences, even while flying at low altitudes, had made the delivery of gravity bombs such as the AN-11 or AN-22 impractical. Thus, it was decided to pass <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>share</b> of the deterrent role onto land-based IRBMs and submarine-based missiles alternatives; as a result, a single wing of Mirage IVs was stood down in 1976, partially due to fleet-wide attrition losses.|$|E
50|$|The {{question}} of limitations on cruiser tonnage was raised {{again at the}} London Naval Conference of 1930, resulting in the London Naval Treaty.
