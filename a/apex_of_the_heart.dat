25|$|Electrical {{activity}} in the normal human heart begins when a cardiac action potential arises in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which {{is located in the}} right atrium. From there, the electrical stimulus is transmitted via internodal pathways to the atrioventricular (AV) node. After a brief delay at the AV node, the stimulus travels through the bundle of His to the left and right bundle branches and then to the Purkinje fibers and the endocardium at the <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> then finally to the ventricular myocardium.|$|E
25|$|It {{may also}} be a result of tensing of the chordae tendineae during rapid filling and {{expansion}} of the ventricle. In other words, an S3 heart sound indicates increased volume of blood within the ventricle. An S3 heart sound is best heard with the bell-side of the stethoscope (used for lower frequency sounds). A left-sided S3 is best heard in the left lateral decubitus position and at the <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> which is normally located in the 5th left intercostal space at the midclavicular line. A right-sided S3 is best heard at the lower-left sternal border. The way to distinguish between a left and right-sided S3 is to observe whether it increases in intensity with inhalation or exhalation. A right-sided S3 will increase on inhalation, while a left-sided S3 will increase on exhalation.|$|E
25|$|Anatomical lines, {{theoretical}} lines {{drawn through}} structures, {{are also used}} to describe anatomical location. For example, the mid-clavicular line is used as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cardiac exam in medicine to feel <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> beat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{cardiovascular}} health <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{human population}} {{is a major}} concern for medical clinicians, with cardiovascular diseases responsible for 48 % of all deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> new diagnostic tools that are practicable and economical to scrutinize <b>the</b> cardiovascular health <b>of</b> humans is a major driver for clinicians. We offer a new technique to obtain seismocardiographic signals up to 54 Hz covering both ballistocardiography (below 20 Hz) and audible heart sounds (20 Hz upward), using a system based on curvature sensors formed from fiber optic long period gratings. This system can visualize the real-time three-dimensional (3 -D) mechanical motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> by using <b>the</b> data from the sensing array in conjunction with a bespoke 3 -D shape reconstruction algorithm. Visualization is demonstrated by adhering three to four sensors on <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thorax and in close proximity to <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart; the sensing scheme revealed a complex motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> wall next to <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> <b>The</b> detection scheme is low-cost, portable, easily operated and has the potential for ambulatory applications...|$|R
25|$|Ventricular {{fibrillation}} is a {{cause of}} cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. The ventricular muscle twitches randomly rather than contracting in a co-ordinated fashion (from the <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to the outflow of the ventricles), and so the ventricles fail to pump blood around the body - because of this, it is classified as a cardiac arrest rhythm, and patients in V-fib should be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and prompt defibrillation. Left untreated, ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body, including the heart, are starved of oxygen, {{and as a result}} patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli. Prior to cardiac arrest, patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying cause. Patients may exhibit signs of agonal breathing, which to the layperson can look like normal spontaneous breathing, but it is in fact a sign of hypoperfusion of the brainstem.|$|E
25|$|The {{coronary}} arteries {{start in the}} right and left aortic sinus and provide blood to the heart muscle in a similar fashion to most other vertebrates. Other domestic birds capable of flight have three or more {{coronary arteries}} that supply blood to the heart muscle. The blood supply by the coronary arteries are fashioned starting as a large branch over the surface of the heart. It then moves along the coronary groove and continues on into the tissue as interventricular branches toward the <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> The atria, ventricles, and septum are supplied of blood by this modality. The deep branches of the coronary arteries found within the heart tissue are small and supply the interventricular and right atrioventricular valve with blood nutrients for which to carry out their processes. The interatrial artery of the ostrich is small in size and exclusively supplies blood to only part of the left auricle and interatrial septum.|$|E
60|$|The very {{beginning}} of our modern right-handedness goes back, indeed, to the most primitive savagery. Why did one hand ever come to be different in use and function from another? The answer is, because man, {{in spite of all}} appearances to the contrary, is really one-sided. Externally, indeed, his congenital one-sidedness doesn't show: but it shows internally. We all of us know, in spite of Sganarelle's assertion to the contrary, that the <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> inclines to the left side, and that the liver and other internal organs show a generous disregard for strict and formal symmetry. In this irregular distribution of those human organs which polite society agrees to ignore, we get the clue to the irregularity of right and left in the human arm, and finally even the particular direction of the printed letters now before you.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{refractory}} period was first described by Fontana in 1760, 7 {{a variety of}} techniques has been employed to study <b>the</b> time-course <b>of</b> recovery of heart excitability and its relation to mechanical and electrical events during the cardiac cycle.

CPC niches in <b>the</b> atria and <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouse <b>heart</b> were infected with a lentivirus carrying EGFP, and <b>the</b> destiny <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tagged cells was determined 1 – 5 months later.

Subsequently, <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> EGFP-lentiviral infection of CPCs was evaluated 2 – 4 days after injection, and <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> myocytes expressing <b>the</b> reporter gene was measured 6 months later. A BrdU pulse-chasing protocol was also introduced {{as an additional}} assay for <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> myocyte turnover.

40|$|The echocardiographic {{examination}} usually {{starts with}} the two-dimensional technique (B-mode), also called real time echocardiography. The two-dimensional technique allows <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> anatomy and spatial relationship of cardiac structures. Monodimensional (M-mode) and Doppler echocardiography represent other imaging modalities overlapped and guided by two-dimensional imaging. For the echocardiographic exam it is necessary use specific transducers, called phased-array. These probes work with a high frame rate, are adapted to the application in the intercostal space, and allows simultaneous B-mode and Doppler acquisition (duplex or triplex imaging). The standard transducer locations on the thorax, called windows, are three and allow to obtain standard imaging planes for two-dimensional echocardiography. Imaging planes obtained from each transducer location are indicated as views and are named {{with respect to their}} orientation with the left ventricle or ascending aorta. A long-axis plane is a plane that is longitudinal to <b>the</b> long axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> from <b>apex</b> to base. A short-axis plane is a plane that is perpendicular to <b>the</b> long-axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> Each view is further identified by <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> cardiac chambers imaged. M-mode ehocardiography uses a narrow ultrasound beam to image only a small portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> and detect only <b>the</b> axial motion <b>of</b> cardiac structures. M-mode technique is guided by B-mode and individual cardiac structures are imaged by moving a single ultrasound beam from <b>apex</b> to base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> <b>The</b> M-mode does not reproduce <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> anatomy and cardiac structure are identified by their characteritic motion pattern. Doppler echocardiography allows to study cardiac blood flows and define flow velocity, direction and quality (laminar or turbolent flow). Doppler imaging is particularly valuable in <b>the</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> acquired valvular heart diseases and congenital heart diseases, in which abnormal flow jets are present. Doppler echocardiography includes three different modalities: 1) pulsed-wave (PW); 2) continuous-wave (CW); 3) color-flow mapping (CFM) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{studied the}} transmembrane {{potential}} and magnetic fields from electrical activity at <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isolated rabbit <b>heart</b> experimentally using optical mapping and {{superconducting quantum interference device}} microscopy, and theoretically using monodomain and bidomain models. The cardiac apex has a complex spiral fiber architecture that {{plays an important}} role in the development and propagation of action currents during stimulation at the apex. This spiral fiber orientation contains both radial electric currents that contribute to the electrocardiogram and electrically silent circular currents that cannot be detected by the electrocardiogram but are detectable by their magnetic field, Bz. In our experiments, the transmembrane potential, Vm, was first measured optically and then Bz was measured with a superconducting quantum interference device microscope. Based on a simple model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spiral structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex,</b> Vm was expected to exhibit circular wave front patterns and Bz to reflect <b>the</b> circular component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> action currents. Although the circular Vm wave fronts were detected, the Bz maps were not as simple as expected. However, we observed a pattern consistent with a tilted axis for the apex spiral fiber geometry. We were able to simulate similar patterns in both a monodomain model of a tilted stack of rings of dipole current and a bidomain model of a tilted stack of spiraled cardiac tissue that was stimulated at the apex. The fact that <b>the</b> spatial pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetic data was more complex than the simple circles observed for Vm suggests that the magnetic data contain information that cannot be found electrically...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} fully automatic segmentation algorithm for cardiac MR data. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> currently published methods are automatic, but they only {{work well in}} 2 D and sometimes in 3 D and do not perform well near the extremities (<b>apex</b> and base) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> Additionally, they require substantial user input to make them feasible {{for use in a}} clinical environment. This dissertation introduces novel approaches to improve the accuracy, robustness, and consistency of existing methods. Segmentation accuracy can be improved by knowing as much about the data as possible. Accordingly, we compute a single 4 D active surface that performs segmentation in space and time simultaneously. The segmentation routine can now take advantage of information from neighboring pixels that can be adjacent either spatially or temporally. Robustness is improved further by using confidence labels on shape priors. Shape priors are deduced from manual segmentation of training data. This data may contain imperfections that may impede proper manual segmentation. Confidence labels indicate <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> fidelity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manual segmentation to the actual data. <b>The</b> contribution <b>of</b> regions with low confidence levels can be attenuated or excluded from the final result. <b>The</b> specific advantages <b>of</b> using <b>the</b> 4 D segmentation along with shape priors and regions of confidence are highlighted throughout the thesis dissertation. Performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new method is measured by comparing the results to traditional 3 D segmentation and to manual segmentation performed by a trained clinician. Ph. D.

40|$|The {{training}} {{resource is}} presented through {{video and audio}} in isiXhosa and Afrikaans, and covers the general examination, abdominal examination, respiratory examination and cardiovascular examination. The material here was prepared for medical students learning about clinical examination techniques as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clinical Skills Programme in <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Medicine at UCT. Physical examination techniques: <b>The</b> techniques <b>of</b> physical examination are in themselves simple, and easy to master. All that is necessary is that you observe carefully, pay attention to detail, and practice repeatedly. Physicians do vary in their techniques of examination. Shown here are a single set of techniques which are both simple to employ and reliable. Your tutors may however make use of slightly different techniques themselves. We suggest that, initially at least, you learn to use the techniques shown here confidently, {{so as not to}} become confused. Practice of your examination technique is essential, and you need to see as many patients who demonstrate abnormal physical signs as possible so that you can learn to recognise them. The following material is covered under the four examinations General Examination: preparing the patient for examination, describing the patient’s appearance, looking for pointers to the problem around the bedside, examination for general features of illness, examination for features of specific illnesses, taking the pulse, assessing warmth, perfusion, hydration and temperature, inspecting the hands, eyes, mouth and pharynx, looking for lymphadenopathy, and inspecting the legs. Abdominal Examination: preparing the patient for the examination, looking for some signs of abdominal disease on a focused “general” examination, inspecting the abdomen, light palpation for areas of tenderness, detecting peritonism, determining the position and size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liver by percussion and palpation, determining the position and size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spleen by percussion and palpation, confirming <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> ascites, other features of portal hypertension, examining the iliac fossae and suprapubic region, detecting enlarged kidneys, identifying other abdominal masses, and listening for bowel sounds. Respiratory examination: preparing the patient for the examination, looking for some signs of respiratory disease on a focused general examination, looking at <b>the</b> pattern <b>of</b> breathing, assessing <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chest and its symmetry by inspection and by palpation, assessing <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trachea, percussing the chest for dullness and resonance, listening to the breath sounds by auscultation. Cardio vascular examination: getting your patient into the right position, general assessment, assess the pulse, measure the blood pressure, measure the jugular venous pressure, palpation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> praecordium, palpation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex,</b> auscultation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> and look for signs of heart failure.
