5|$|Isabeau was {{dismissed}} by historians as a wanton, weak and indecisive leader. Modern historians now {{see her as}} taking an unusually active leadership role for a queen of her period, forced to take responsibility {{as a direct result}} of Charles' illness. Her critics accepted skewed interpretations of her role in the negotiations with England, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, and in the rumors of her marital infidelity with Orléans. Gibbons writes that a queen's duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> to be seen as one of the great villains of history. Gibbons goes on to say that even her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether she was to be portrayed as good or evil.|$|E

The Prussian vessels remained on the disengaged side of the Austrian frigates, firing at the Danish vessels with little effect. One of the Austrian vessels scored a hit on Jylland that killed or wounded all the men in one of her gun crews. The crews of the guns on either side fled their positions {{at the sight of the}} carnage until one of the men returned, calling his comrades to join him. During this period of the battle, Schwarzenberg suffered multiple shell hits and was set afire three times. Her crew extinguished the first two, but the third, in her foretopsail, proved to be too difficult to fight.|$|E

25|$|Entering her thirties, the 1981 season {{proved to}} be the high point of Sorokina's career. She won an 800m/1500m double at the Soviet Indoor Championships. She set {{personal}} bests in both events outdoors, running 1:57.55 minutes for the 800m in August and 3.58.89 minutes for the 1500m – both these times ranked her fourth in the world for the season. She was the Soviet representative in the 1500m at the 1981 European Cup <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> away with the gold medal (her first international title), recording a championship record of 4:01.37 minutes to beat East German Olympic medallist Ulrike Bruns. This ensured her place on the national team for the 1981 IAAF World Cup and she again finished ahead of Bruns, as well as future Olympic champion Gabriella Dorio.

The 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships followed shortly <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> close to the podium in the triple jump competition but while her jump of 14.58m was enough to set an indoor Asian record, it was not enough to push Marija Šestak out of the bronze medal position. Similar bitter-sweet results awaited her at the 2008 Summer Olympics, her first time representing Kazakhstan at the Summer Olympics. She entered both the horizontal jump competitions and recorded a new Asian record of 15.11m in the Olympic triple jump contest. In spite of this, she remained some ten centimetres behind the bronze medallist Hrysopiyi Devetzi of Greece.

She achieved the same mark outdoors to take second at the Prefontaine Classic and was runner-up to Dragila at the 2004 Olympic Trials, securing her first Olympic berth.

Richard Goodman wrote that Larkin excelled as an administrator, committee man and arbitrator. [...] "He treated his staff decently, and he motivated them", Goodman said. [...] "He did this {{with a combination of}} efficiency, high standards, humour and compassion." [...] From 1957 until his death, Larkin's secretary was Betty Mackereth.

At 23:07 it became clear that the ships of the 20th Flotilla had entered a German minefield when Express struck a mine abreast 'B' gun, losing her entire bow up to the bridge. The detonation killed 4 officers and 54 ratings; one officer and 7 crewmen were later rescued by the Germans. Esk and Ivanhoe, the closest ships to Express, closed to render assistance, while the other two destroyers turned hard [...] to starboard and retraced their route to exit the minefield, according to standing orders. Five minutes after the first mine detonated, Esks bow struck a mine <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> to a stop. Five minutes later Ivanhoe struck another mine that badly damaged her bow. At about 23:20, Esk struck another mine amidships that detonated her magazines.
