NIR spectra were measured and the relative density, alcohol content, dry extract, reducing sugars, pH, total acidity, volatile acidity, ash, free sulphur dioxide and total sulphur dioxide were determined. The range of NIRS used in this paper was 904 – 1699 nm (i. e. 11062 – 5886 cm− 1) because in this range vibrations of C–H, O–H, S–H and N–H bonds can mainly be observed. Using the basic principles of multivariate analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), was used to reduce the input matrix in order to look for significant relationships between the NIR spectra and the observed characteristics of wine Prošek. Chemometrics applied here resulted in further discrimination between samples. The main features of the spectra are absorption bands at 1580 and 1670 nm, which are related to the first overtone of the C–H stretch. Absorption bands around 908 nm, present the stretches related to the 3 rd C–H overtone and 2 nd overtone of the O–H stretch of H 2 O and ethanol.

40|$|Maturation of wine, {{also called}} ageing, is an {{important}} process in making premium wine. During this process, many compounds change in concentration, and these changes are responsible for colour and flavour changes {{that contribute to the}} complexity of matured wine. However, ageing is an expensive process due to the time taken, frequently years, the cost of which cannot be recovered until sale. Alternating electrical fields have purportedly been shown to accelerate <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> as judged by informal sensory trials, and by limited results in the scientific literature. This research aimed to quantity the changes due to electric fields in terms of sensory and chemical science. Wine ageing machines (WAM) equipped with alternating electric fields were used to treat red wines (Cabernet Merlot, Pinot Noir and Merlot Cabernet Sauvignon) and white wine (Sauvignon Blanc). There were three versions of WAM: a flow-through WAM from the University of Waikato, a flow-through WAM 2 (a modified version of the original), and a static WAM. In the first two, the wine flows through glass tubing between the charged plates 1 cm apart. In the static WAM, tubes containing wine are suspended between vertical plates. In the present study, electric fields were adjusted with different frequencies and strengths. The wines were physicochemically analysed by ultraviolet spectrometry, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/ mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Further, sensory tests were conducted between control wines and WAM-treated wines. Only flow-through WAM 2 treated Sauvignon Blanc appeared to show an absorbance difference in the wavelength range of 230 to 350 nm, but the difference was finally interpreted as artifactual arising from electronic noise in the spectrophotometer. Further, other WAM-treated wines did not show any sensory or colour differences compared with control wines that could not be attributed to noise. In LC-MS (/MS) studies, several compounds were shown to vary with treatment, notably 2 -furoic acid in white wine. However, the differences observed were inconsistent and might have been due to statistical variation that can arise in 1 in 20 events by chance alone. It was concluded that these WAMs had no effect on wine ageing in the manner they were applied here...|$|E

Samples of wines and samples of distillates made from these wines were analysed using liquid-liquid extraction method (LLE) followed by gas chromatography analysis (GC). Potential characteristics [...] chemical markers were determined: trans-linalool oxide and cislinalool oxide which are typical for Muscat Ottonel and tetradecanote, ethyl 3 - methylpentanoate for Pinot Blanc. In wine distillates, ethyl 2 -methylbutanoate, ethyl 3 - methylpentanoate, 1, 1 -diethoxybutane, diethoxypentane were determined, however none of these substances were found in wines. These substances probably originate {{as a result of}} esterification process during <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> distillates after distillation process. Differences in chemical composition of wine distillates made from red wine grape cultivars were analysed using main component method. Group of substances such as ethyl butanoate, hexanoate, octanoate, decanoate, dodecanoate and diethyl succinate can be considered as possible markers identifying wine distillates from red wine grape cultivars and white grape cultivars. Characteristic aroma of grape variety was recognisable in wine distillates from Muscat Ottonell and Blue Frankish varieties. Samples of wine and wine distillates were analysed using Solid-phase micro extraction (SPME-headspace) technique followed by Gas chromatography [...] mass spectrometry (GCMS). Negative correlation between 1 -hexanol content and intensity of aroma was discovered in wine distillates. Characteristic aroma of grape variety showed significantly in distillates from Pinot Gris (RS_ 2) and in distillates from red wine grape cultivars, particularly Saint Laurent (SV) and Pinot Noir. Based on analysis of samples of wine distillates from red wine grape cultivars, ten major terpentic aromatic substances were determined (o-cymen, limonen, cis-b-ocimen, cislinalool oxid, linalool, isoborneol, terpinen- 4 -ol, a-terpineol, trans-sabinyl acetate a transkalamenen). All these substances influence aroma of grape variety. Both centred log ratio transform (clr) and main component method were applied and similarity in aroma of wine distillates was found and it was discovered that aroma of wine distillate from varieties Merlot, Pinot Noir and similar ones are influenced by terpenoids cis-linalool oxid, linalool, 94 isoborneol, terpinen- 4 -ol a a-terpineol. On the other hand, aroma of wine distillates from varieties Blue Portugieser and Cabernet Sauvignon are influenced by o-cymen, limonen, trans-sabinyl acetate and trans-kalamenen. Analysis of terpentic content wine distillates was carried out using Solid-phase micro extraction (SPME-headspace) technique followed by Gas chromatography [...] mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Major terpentic substances identified are limonen, linalool, a-ylangen, b- bourbonen, g-kadinen, trans-nerolidol, 2, 3 -dihydrofarnesol and (2 -cis, 6 -trans) -farnesol.
