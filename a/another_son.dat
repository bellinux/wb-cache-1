Although it is unknown how long the Dubliners possessed the fortress, in 1036 <b>another</b> <b>son</b> of Sitriuc was slain in Wales by an apparent kinsman, an event which could be evidence of a struggle for control of the site.

5|$|After Leif's {{first trip}} to Vinland, he {{returned}} to the family estate of Brattahlíð in Greenland, and started preaching Christianity to the Greenlanders.

60|$|But we may {{see also}} {{that there is no}} {{difference}} in will, or opinion, or love, between the Holy Spirit and the Father and the Son. For the Spirit does not speak of Himself; there is no self-will in Him. There is not one will of the Father, and <b>another</b> of the <b>Son,</b> and <b>another</b> of the Holy Ghost; or, one love of the Father, another love of the <b>Son,</b> and <b>another</b> of the Holy Ghost; or, one righteousness of the Father, <b>another</b> of the <b>Son,</b> <b>another</b> of the Holy Ghost: or, one mercy and grace of the Father, <b>another</b> of the <b>Son,</b> <b>another</b> of the Holy Ghost. For then there would be three Gods and three Lords; and the substance of God would be divided. But they have all one will, and one love, and one righteousness, and one mercy. And such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost.|$|R
