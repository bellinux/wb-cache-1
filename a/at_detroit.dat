5|$|Thanks to an {{effective}} intelligence network, British officials and their American Indian allies {{were aware of}} Clark's planned expedition as early as February 1781. In April, a council was held <b>at</b> <b>Detroit</b> in order to prepare a defense. The commander <b>at</b> <b>Detroit</b> was Major Arent DePeyster, Henry Hamilton's replacement, who reported to Sir Frederick Haldimand, the Governor of the Province of Quebec. DePeyster used agents of the British Indian Department such as Alexander McKee and Simon Girty, both of whom had close relations with American Indians of the Ohio Country, to coordinate British and Indian military operations.|$|E

5|$|Clark's {{ultimate}} goal during the Revolutionary War was {{to seize the}} British-held fort <b>at</b> <b>Detroit,</b> but he could never recruit enough men and acquire sufficient munitions to make the attempt. Kentucky militiamen generally preferred to defend their homes by staying closer to Kentucky, instead of making a long and potentially perilous expedition to Detroit. Clark returned to the Falls of the Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued to defend the Ohio River valley {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E

5|$|In 1992 Rambhadracharya led the Indian {{delegation}} at the Ninth World Conference on Ramayana, held in Indonesia. He has travelled {{to several}} countries, including England, Mauritius, Singapore, and the United States to deliver discourses on Hindu religion and peace. He has been profiled in the International Who's Who of Intellectuals. He {{was also one}} of the key figures of the Dharma Prachar Yatra <b>at</b> <b>Detroit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{force was}} {{originally}} intended to join General William Hull <b>at</b> <b>Detroit,</b> but Hull surrendered Detroit on August 16 and his army was captured. Johnson reported to William Henry Harrison, Territorial Governor of Indiana, then {{in command of the}} entire Northwest frontier. He was ordered to relieve Fort Wayne in the northeast of the Territory, which was already being attacked by the Indians. On September 18, 1812, Johnson's men reached Fort Wayne in time to save it, and turned back an Indian ambush. They returned to Kentucky and disbanded, going {{out of their way to}} burn Potawatomi villages along the Elkhart River.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements, the British {{attempted to}} make a surprise attack on Pontiac's encampment. But Pontiac was ready and waiting, and defeated them at the Battle of Bloody Run on July 31, 1763. Nevertheless, the situation at Fort Detroit remained a stalemate, and Pontiac's influence among his followers began to wane. Groups of Native Americans began to abandon the siege, some of them making peace with the British before departing. On October 31, 1763, finally convinced that the French in Illinois would not come to his aid <b>at</b> <b>Detroit,</b> Pontiac lifted the siege and removed to the Maumee River, where he continued his efforts to rally resistance against the British.|$|E

5|$|Before other British {{outposts}} {{had learned}} about Pontiac's siege <b>at</b> <b>Detroit,</b> Native Americans captured five small forts {{in a series of}} attacks between May 16 and June 2. The first to be taken was Fort Sandusky, a small blockhouse on the shore of Lake Erie. It had been built in 1761 by order of General Amherst, despite the objections of local Wyandots, who in 1762 warned the commander that they would soon burn it down. On May 16, 1763, a group of Wyandots gained entry under the pretense of holding a council, the same stratagem that had failed in Detroit nine days earlier. They seized the commander and killed the other 15 soldiers, as well as British traders at the fort. These were among the first of about 100 traders who were killed {{in the early stages of}} the war. The dead were ritually scalped and the fort—as the Wyandots had warned a year earlier—was burned to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Brock's {{successor}} <b>at</b> <b>Detroit,</b> however, fared much worse. Colonel Henry Procter {{faced an}} attack from a resurrected American Army of the Northwest under future President William Henry Harrison. Harrison {{set out to}} retake Detroit, but a detachment of his army was defeated at Frenchtown on 22 January 1813. Procter, displaying poor judgement, left the prisoners {{in the custody of}} his First Nations allies, who proceeded to execute an indeterminate number of them. Subsequent American victories allowed Harrison to attempt another invasion of Canada, which led to the Battle of the Thames on 5 October 1813. After a successful American charge, Procter's forces turned and fled, leaving Tecumseh and his American Indian troops to fight alone. They fought on, eventually being defeated. Perhaps of more importance to the British, at this battle Tecumseh died, and their alliance with the American Indians effectively ended.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Detroit and Hull's army wounded American morale, and {{eliminated}} the main American {{force in the}} area as a threat, {{while at the same}} time boosting morale among his own forces. Brock took the American supplies <b>at</b> <b>Detroit</b> and used them for his own forces, particularly the ill-equipped militia. Under prize regulations, a substantial part of the value of the captured military stores would accrue to him. (If he had lived longer, he could have settled his debts.) Brock valued the captured ordnance supplies at £30,000. Finally, the victory secured the support of Tecumseh and the other chiefs in his confederation, who took Brock's actions as both a sign of competence and a willingness to take action.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{was mostly}} {{done in the}} St. Louis area. Several scenes were filmed at the Berry and McNamara Terminals <b>at</b> <b>Detroit</b> Metro Airport in late February 2009 with minimal filming in Omaha, in Las Vegas and in Miami, Florida. Missouri and St. Louis leaders {{provided}} $4.1 million in tax credits for the $25 million film. Producers set up a St. Louis, Missouri production office on January 5, 2009. Filming began in St. Louis on March 3, 2009, and continued {{through the end of}} April. The film includes 80 different sets at 50 locations throughout the St. Louis area, including Lambert-St. Louis International Airport Concourse C and Concourse D (which played the part of several airports across America), the Mansion House apartments in downtown St. Louis, Hilton St. Louis at the Ballpark, Hilton St. Louis Airport, the Cheshire Inn, the GenAmerica building, Renaissance Grand Hotel, Maplewood United Methodist Church, and Affton High School. The film was shot at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport for five days, twenty hours each day.|$|E
5|$|May 9 {{was one of}} {{two times}} Young came within an inning of a shutout by {{pitching}} eight scoreless innings; August 17 against the Cleveland Indians was the other. Young recorded a personal-best eight strikeouts in a seven-inning no-decision on June 2 <b>at</b> <b>Detroit.</b> The closest Young came to a no-hitter was 5⅔ innings of hitless pitching in a road game against the Houston Astros on June 25 before allowing a Craig Biggio single in the sixth inning. Over the course of the season, Young was the beneficiary of the second-highest run support in the majors, trailing only David Wells of the Boston Red Sox. However, he surrendered three runs or less in 22 of 31 starts. After a 2005 season when he went 5–0 with a 3.47 ERA in 11 games during the day and 7–7 with a 4.71 ERA in 20 games at night, he had a career 8–1 record with a 3.31 ERA in 15 day games and 7–8 with a 5.05 mark in 23 games at night.|$|E
5|$|The State Trunkline Highway System {{was formed}} on May 13, 1913, and several {{sections}} of the system were designated along {{the course of the}} then-future I-75. Division1 connected the Ohio state line northeasterly to Detroit, and Division2 connected Detroit with Mackinaw City. A branch of Division7 ran north from St. Ignace to Sault Ste. Marie. The system was signposted in 1919, and those highways were marked on maps for the first time. The first M-10 was designated along the highways from Ohio through Detroit to Standish. M-76 connected Standish with Grayling, where the first M-14 ran northward to Cheboygan. From there, M-10 connected to Mackinaw City. In the UP, M-12 connected St. Ignace with Sault Ste. Marie along a route to the east of the old Mackinac Trail. When the United States Numbered Highway System was formed on November 11, 1926, most of these highways were redesignated as part of the national system. From the state line northward, M-10 was included as a part of US24 and US25. <b>At</b> <b>Detroit,</b> M-10 was used as a part of US10. North of Grayling, M-14 was redesignated as a part of US27. M-12 was used for US2.|$|E

5|$|In the 2001–02 season, {{the team}} {{finished}} {{the regular season}} with 99 points from a 45–28–8–1 record and won the Northwest Division. Colorado had the league's lowest goals conceded: 169, an average of 2.06 per game. The NHL season was interrupted once again for the 2002 Winter Olympics, in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Avalanche had nine players representing six countries. Canada won the ice hockey tournament and Rob Blake, Adam Foote and Joe Sakic won gold medals. American Chris Drury got a silver medal. With the win, Blake and Sakic became members of the Triple Gold Club. The Avalanche advanced through {{the first two rounds}} of the playoffs winning 4–3 against the Los Angeles Kings and 4–3 against the San Jose Sharks. Patrick Roy had a shutout on the decisive game of each series. The Avalanche made the Western Conference Finals for the fourth consecutive season (and sixth overall in the last seven seasons), meeting the Detroit Red Wings in the playoffs for the fifth time in seven years. Colorado had a 3–2 lead after five games, but lost Game 6 at home 2–0 and then the Red Wings won the deciding game <b>at</b> <b>Detroit,</b> 7–0. As in 1997, Detroit {{went on to win the}} Stanley Cup. Peter Forsberg was the playoffs scoring leader with 27 points (9 goals, 18 assists). Patrick Roy won the William M. Jennings Trophy, given to the goaltenders of the team with fewest goals scored against. Roy was elected for the league's first All-Star team, together with Joe Sakic. Rob Blake was elected for the second All-Star team.|$|E
5|$|The 2004 Colts {{opened the}} season with a 27–24 loss to the Patriots, after placekicker Mike Vanderjagt missed a game-tying field goal in the closing seconds of the game. The Colts won their next four games {{including}} a 45–31 win over Green Bay in which Manning threw fivetouchdowns, earning him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors, but then lost their next two games, to Jacksonville and Kansas City, despite Manning throwing for 840yards combined in the two games. The Colts responded well, winning their next eight games before losing their final regular season game to Denver, a game in which Manning played only the first series. During the month of November, Manning was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week twice; once for his five-touchdown performance in a 49–14 blowout of Houston and once for his performance in a 41–9 win <b>at</b> <b>Detroit</b> on Thanksgiving in which he threw sixtouchdowns in less than three quarters. Due to his performances in November, Manning earned AFC Offensive Player of the Month honors. He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for a fourth time in the Week 16 game against San Diego where he led the Colts to a 34–31 victory after trailing by fifteen in the fourth quarter. With the Colts facing a 4th & 4 at their own 26, Manning waved the punt team off the field and completed a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne for the first down. He finished the drive with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Stokley, his 49th touchdown pass of the season, breaking Dan Marino's record of 48. After the two-point conversion to tie, Manning got the ball first in overtime and set up the winning field goal. The Colts clinched the AFC's third seed with the win.|$|E
