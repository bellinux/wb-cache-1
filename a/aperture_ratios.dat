50|$|Amorphous silicon TFTs {{have been}} widely used in liquid-crystal display (LCD) flat panels because they can be {{assembled}} into complex high-current driver circuits. Amorphous Si-TFT electrodes drive the alignment of crystals in LCDs. The evolution to LTPS-TFTs can have many benefits such as higher device resolution, lower synthesis temperature, and reduced price of essential substrates. However, LTPS-TFTs also have several drawbacks. For example, the area of TFTs in traditional a-Si devices is large, resulting in a small aperture ratio (the amount of area which is not blocked by the opaque TFT and thus admits light). The incompatibility of different <b>aperture</b> <b>ratios</b> prevents LTPS-based complex circuits and drivers from being integrated into a-Si material. Additionally, the quality of LTPS decreases over time due to an increase in temperature upon turning on the transistor, which degrades the film by breaking the Si-H bonds in the material. This would cause the device to suffer from drain breakdown and current leakage, most notably in small and thin transistors, which dissipate heat poorly.|$|E

Discharge coefficients of a wooden ventilation duct 8. 54 metres in length and of a constant 0. 17 m$ sp 2 $ cross sectional area were measured. Four different outlet shapes and 3 <b>aperture</b> <b>ratios</b> of each shape were tested. A split plot experimental design was used to evaluate the effect of outlet shape, outlet size, and distance from the fan on discharge coefficient. The relationship between duct performance characteristics and discharge coefficient was examined. A mathematical equation to predict the discharge coefficient was developed and tested. Discharge coefficient values measured ranged from 0. 19 to 1. 25 depending on the aperture ratio and distance from the fan. Outlet shape had no significant effect. The apparent effects of aperture ratio and size are due to the effects of head ratio.

40|$|International audienceThe present article {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} and numerical investigation {{of heat and}} mass infiltration rates during {{the opening of a}} refrigerated truck body. Experiments were carried out for different temperatures and different <b>aperture</b> <b>ratios.</b> The infiltration dynamics was found to involve two distinct phenomena: a buoyancy driven flow and a boundary layer flow. The first is a density-driven flow which gives birth to an important heat load peak. The second phenomenon is due to quasi steady-state natural convection over the inner wall of the truck. In the present work, the infiltration phenomenon was first analysed by means of a computational fluid dynamics model. The infiltration flow rate is well predicted except at the transition between both flow regimes. An analytical model using the ideal flow theory was also developed to model the buoyancy driven flow. The natural convection boundary layer flow is then well predicted using a classical method...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model {{was developed to}} predict the air distribution pattern and thus to design perforated ventilation ducts equipped with a fan. The analysis of the air distribution pattern of such systems requires accurate measurement procedures. Several experimental methods were tested and compared. Accordingly, the piezometric flush taps and thermo-anemometer were selected to measure respectively the duct air pressure and the outlet air flow. Based on the equations of energy and momentum conservation, a model was formulated to predict the air flow performance of perforated ventilation ducts and to evaluate the outlet discharge angle and the duct regain coefficients without evaluating frictional losses. The basic assumptions of the model were validated by experimentally proving the equivalence of the friction losses expressed in the 2 cited equations. When compared to experimental results measured from four wooden perforated ventilation ducts with <b>aperture</b> <b>ratios</b> of 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0, the model predicted the outlet air flow along {{the full length of}} perforated duct operated under turbulent flow conditions with a maximum error of 9 %.

Assuming a common effective outlet area, the model was extended to match the performance of the fan and the perforated duct and to determine their balance operating point...|$|E
