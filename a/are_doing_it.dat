The games were held in the King of the Hill offices, where Daniel served as executive producer. Daniels later elaborated on the types of games they played, stating [...] "Like, who’s going to get off the elevator first and races in chairs. The funny thing is then it became a TV episode and it has now gone full circle and I hear offices <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> all over." [...] After the episode aired, other [...] "Office Olympics" [...] were organized in actual offices across the country. The Chicago Tribune organized an interview with a majority of The Office cast members who—in character—explained the rules to the various games.

[...] Sheep graze {{much more on the}} land and are more of a threat to the deer. [...] The owners that choose cattle <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> as a service, because more money is made from raising sheep than cattle. [...] Conservationists encourage this trend by sharing research that more edible vegetation is available on ranches with cattle and deer during times of drought than on ranches with cattle and sheep.|$|E
2500|$|He {{also was}} noted for a {{willingness}} to remove senior leaders under his command {{at a time when}} the U.S. military seemed unable or unwilling to relieve under-performing or incompetent officers. During the division's push to Baghdad, Mattis relieved Colonel Joe D. Dowdy, commander of Regimental Combat Team-1. It was such a rare occurrence in the modern military that it made the front page of newspapers. Despite this, Mattis declined to comment on the matter publicly other than to say that the practice of officer relief remains alive, or at least [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> in the Marines." [...] Later interviews of Dowdy's officers and men revealed that [...] "the colonel was doomed partly by an age-old wartime tension: Men versus mission—in which he favored his men" [...] while Mattis insisted on execution of the mission to seize Baghdad swiftly.|$|E

As far back as 1998, Neil Strauss reported that to visual kei bands [...] "after X" [...] makeup and outrageous looks became [...] "more important than music". Several older musicians expressed their discontent; Kirito (Pierrot, Angelo) said [...] "now it's more like people are dressing up a certain way {{because they want to}} be visual kei or look visual kei.

[...] The award will recognize outstanding achievement in bridge engineering that provides an icon to the community {{for which it was}} designed (Bridge Design & Engineering 2002). Over all the Figg Engineering Group has designed more segmental concrete bridges in America than all other firms combined, and has won more than 140 design awards (ASCE 2002).

He launched Internet videos on WrestleView saying the WWE's switch to PG was politically motivated: [...] "...they (Linda and Vince) <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> strictly to get Linda McMahon elected to Senator of Connecticut", he stated in one video. Billy Graham contracted Hepatitis C from another wrestler's blood during his time in WWE and required a life-saving liver transplant as a result. When speaking about Linda, he said, [...] "She may look like a Sunday school teacher. Linda McMahon's hands are as bloody as her husband's because she is aware of every move in the ring. She has had no problem with grown men—myself included—cutting their head with a razor blade. All of a sudden, why aren't these guys bleeding anymore? Because Linda is running for the Senate."

2500|$|After {{absorbing}} all {{the souls}} from Purgatory and declaring himself God, Castiel goes forth to punish all the wrongdoers in the world. Very quickly, though, he discovers that he absorbed the Leviathans, who {{are attempting to}} break free of his vessel. Sam and Dean manage to return most of the souls to Purgatory but fail to return the Leviathans, who seemingly kill Castiel before vanishing. The Leviathans inhabit the bodies of many different people around the world. Sam and Dean learn that their weakness is Sodium Borate (aka Borax), though it has minimum effectiveness on the Leviathan leader Dick Roman. After Roman kills Bobby, Dean becomes obsessed with taking the Leviathans down and learns of a facility they are building, {{only to discover that}} it is a facility to cure cancer. As one Leviathan states, [...] "We're only here to help". The spirit of Bobby later confirms that while they are curing disease, they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> as part of their grand plan to turn humanity into the perfect food source. With the help of Castiel, and Kevin, a prophet of the lord, the brothers learn {{that the only way to}} kill the Leviathans is with the [...] "bone of a righteous mortal washed in the three bloods of the fallen" [...] and set out to find the three bloods. Kevin can read the word of God and helps Sam and Dean decipher the word to stop the Leviathans. Eventually, Dean and Castiel kill Dick but are dragged into Purgatory as a result, while Sam is left alone to deal with Crowley, who plans to rise to power now that the Leviathans are disorganized.|$|E
