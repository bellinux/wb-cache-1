5|$|Although its {{evolutionary}} history—what the forerunner to {{the species}} {{was and how}} the close relatives branched off—is not well understood, the painted turtle is common in the fossil record. The oldest samples, found in Nebraska, date to about 15million years ago. Fossils from 15million to about 5million years ago <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the Nebraska-Kansas area, but more recent fossils are gradually more widely distributed. Fossils newer than 300,000years old are found in almost all the United States and southern Canada.|$|E

Four species of the genus Tachycineta have white rumps and underparts, but they have bright metallic green or blue-green upperparts, longer tails, and <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> Central and South America.

5|$|Coccothrinax is a genus of fan palms found {{throughout}} the Caribbean and in adjacent parts of southern Florida and Mexico. Most species are small to medium-sized, with maximum heights between 5 and 15 metres (17 and 49ft). Only one of the 53 species, C. readii, is absent from the insular Caribbean. Two species, C. argentata and C. barbadensis, are widespread, {{while most of the}} others <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> Cuba and Hispaniola.|$|E

5|$|Limiting the {{availability}} of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> packs of 32 x 500mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 x 500mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion. In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively. Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers {{had a significant effect}} in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.|$|E
5|$|Players {{select one}} of several {{characters}} from the DC Universe to engage in combat, aiming to knock out their opponent.

Injustice builds upon several aspects from NetherRealm Studios' previous title, Mortal Kombat, including its controls, game mechanics, narrative-driven campaign, and online functionality.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, <b>restricted</b> distributions; this <b>is</b> most common in island endemics. The whistling dove is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded fruit dove <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|R

5|$|Among {{the local}} {{television}} {{stations in the}} city, TVR Cluj (public) and One TV (private) broadcast regionally, while the others <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the metropolitan area. Napoca Cable Network is available through cable, and broadcasts local content throughout the day. Other stations work as affiliates of national TV stations, only providing the audience with local reports {{in addition to the}} national programming. This situation is mirrored in the radio broadcasting companies: except for Radio Cluj, Radio Impuls and the Hungarian-language Paprika Rádió, all other stations are local affiliates of the national broadcasters. Casa Radio, situated on Donath Street, is one of the modern landmarks of the media and communications industry; it is, however, not the only one: Palatul Telefoanelor ("the telephone palace") is also a major modernist symbol of communications in the city centre.|$|E
5|$|At least 1300 cicada {{species are}} {{distributed}} worldwide {{with the majority}} being in the tropics. Most genera <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> a single biogeographical region and many species have a very limited range. This high degree of endemism {{has been used to}} study the biogeography of complex island groups such as in Indonesia and the Orient. There are about 200 described species in Australia and New Zealand, around 150 in South Africa, over 170 in America north of Mexico, at least 800 in Latin America, and over 200 in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. About 100 species occur in the Palaearctic. A few species are found in southern Europe, and a single species is in England, the New Forest cicada, Melampsalta montana, which also occurs in continental Europe.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} and abundance of live (rose Bengal-stained) and dead infaunal foraminifera have been document-ed in short cores taken at four locations representing {{a narrow range}} of salinity settings in the mangrove swamps of the Setiu wetland, Terengganu, peninsular Malaysia. Cores were taken at mud-rich sites, two in the mid-swamp and two in the high swamp, from mainland-fringing mangrove swamps charac-terized by generally sandy substrates. Twenty-four taxa were recorded as live. Of these, two <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the mid-swamp, eight <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the high swamp, seven <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> shallow-infaunal depths (0 – 16 cm), and three <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> deep-infaunal depths (. 16 cm).

5|$|Buses, {{which are}} the most {{commonly}} used mode of transport, are run by government agencies and private operators. Kolkata is the only Indian city with a tram network, which is operated by the Calcutta Tramways Company. The slow-moving tram services <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> certain areas of the city. Water-logging, caused by heavy rains that fall during the summer monsoon, can interrupt transportation networks. Hired public conveyances include auto rickshaws, which often ply specific routes, and yellow metered taxis. Almost all of Kolkata's taxis are antiquated Hindustan Ambassadors by make; newer air-conditioned radio taxis are also in service. In parts of the city, cycle rickshaws and hand-pulled rickshaws are patronised by the public for short trips.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are almost}} {{invariably}} laid on plants. Each species of butterfly {{has its own}} host plant range and while some species of butterfly <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great spangled fritillary, the eggs are deposited close to {{but not on the}} food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there is}} no attempt by the artist to soften the subject's {{brutality}} through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically morbid theme. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish. Few would admire the work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.|$|E
