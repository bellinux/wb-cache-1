6000|$|... "You <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> are {{not living}} {{together}} at the present time," [...] he resumed. [...] "Does that mean that Eustace has left you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is remarkable! So you've been married? I {{should not}} have thought that possible; <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> desarted you, too. Well, such things do happen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My little friend," [...] he said, {{patting the}} hand of the fair lady by his side, [...] "reassure yourself. <b>Your</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> friends are quite safe. For England there will come no fighting. Believe me, that is a true word." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Very," [...] he admitted, [...] "yet, after all, why not? If we succeed, it is, at any rate, the end {{of their}} private fortunes, of Phipps' ambitions <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> dreams of wealth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> {{have treated}} me with such kind {{hospitality}} that I {{am not going}} to offer you anything in return for what you have done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At least," [...] he said, [...] "believe {{me that my}} {{congratulations}} {{come from}} my heart. Your happiness is written in your face, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> must be the proudest man in England." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I promise," [...] {{he said as}} I {{gave him}} the papers. [...] "I shall in the morning, as soon as I can, come to see you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband,</b> if I may." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Madam,’ said he, ‘I am {{come upon}} a weighty errand; and I would have you {{recognise}} it as an effect of kindness in the President, that he should send as his ambassador <b>your</b> only neighbour <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband’s</b> oldest friend in Utah.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A mere fancy of mine," [...] said Piero, lifting off his skull-cap, {{scratching}} his head, {{and making the}} usual grimace by which he avoided the betrayal of any feeling. [...] "I wanted a handsome young face for it, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> was just the thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] said he, [...] "I am {{come upon}} a weighty errand; and I would have you {{recognise}} it as an effect of kindness in the President, that he should send as his ambassador <b>your</b> only neighbour <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> oldest friend in Utah." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can {{you look}} back to the day of your marriage? Can you {{remember}} the words which declared the union between you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> to be separable only by death? Has he treated you with brutal cruelty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] he continued, [...] "that {{the idea}} does not appeal to you! I can {{understand}} that my presence may serve to recall a period which you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> would doubtless prefer to forget--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then they'll start {{buying the}} Americans {{out of some}} other valley. And the Americans will spend the money and by the second {{generation}} start rotting in the cities, as you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> would have rotted if you hadn't got out." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{must find}} means to {{sprinkle}} it upon <b>your</b> sister's food, <b>and</b> thereafter <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> shall come to hate even {{the sight of}} her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, but if I {{bought the}} mill, <b>and</b> allowed <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> {{to act as}} my manager in the same way, how then?" [...] said Mr. Wakem.|$|R
6000|$|... "It strikes me," [...] said Jone, [...] "that these {{quarters}} {{are good}} enough for us. I'm comfortable." [...] And {{then he went on}} to say, madam, that when you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> was in London you was well satisfied with just such lodgings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember what I told you. I {{have heard}} {{every word of}} the {{conversation}} between Captain Helding <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband.</b> A man came to the captain this morning and volunteered to join the Wanderer. The captain has taken him. The man is Richard Wardour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Know you! Of course I know you. You're a lady, {{and your}} father's a rich man, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> thinks {{no end of}} himself. And we're poor people, so it don't matter whether we're robbed and ruined or not. That's about it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't want to {{make the}} worst of you, Bessy," [...] said Mrs. Pullet, compassionately, [...] "for I doubt you'll have trouble enough without that; <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> got that poor sister and her {{children}} hanging on him,--and so given to lawing, they say. I doubt he'll leave you poorly off when he dies. Not as I'd have it said out o' the family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This resolution, let me {{hasten to}} assure you, {{has not been}} brought about by any persuasions of mine. It is the natural {{outgrowth}} of <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> gratitude <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> love. The first words he said to me, when {{he was able to}} speak, were these: 'If I live to return to England, and if I go to Valeria, do you think she will forgive me?' We can only leave it to you, my dear, to give the answer. If you love us, answer us by return of post.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} judge, who looked a trifle embarrassed, [...] "I guess you are right, and Larry {{would have to}} tell you; but it's not a {{pleasant}} task to me. It is just this--we can't keep you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> any longer in this town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Greeting, Lady of Egypt," [...] she said. [...] "Ah! had you {{taken my}} counsel in the past, that title {{might have been}} yours in very truth, and there you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> could have founded {{a new line of}} kings {{independent}} of the Empire which totters to its fall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have not his {{attempted}} {{crimes against}} you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> forfeited whatever rights {{the bonds of}} kinship might have accorded him?" [...] asked Tarzan. [...] "The {{fact that you are}} his sister has not deterred him from seeking to besmirch your honor. You owe him no loyalty, madame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, dame--true,--let us {{hope for}} the best; but I must take my cloak and rapier, <b>and</b> pray <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> in {{courtesy}} to teach me {{the way to a}} magistrate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Matthew {{will come}} and see me at last," [...] said Miss Havisham, sternly, [...] "when I am laid on that table. That will be his place,--there," [...] {{striking}} the table with her stick, [...] "at my head! And yours will be there! <b>And</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> there! <b>And</b> Sarah Pocket's there! And Georgiana's there! Now you all know where to take your stations {{when you come to}} feast upon me. And now go!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{venture to}} predict, on a slight acquaintance," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Shorter, undisturbed, [...] "that you will {{pick out the}} house you want, <b>and</b> that <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> will move into it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--if I {{must speak}} plain, dear Grace--to ask her, appeal {{to her in}} the name of your common womanhood, and your many like sentiments on things, not to make {{unhappiness}} between you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband.</b> It lies with her entirely to do one or the other--that I can see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It don't matter," [...] {{said the}} young man. [...] "Only I would sooner {{stay with you}} than at a lodging-house. I've taken a fancy to you. I say, {{it would be a}} lark if you did, and I went there <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> thought I was your son, wouldn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “That {{sounds more}} probable,” said Egbert; “well, let’s {{collaborate}} on this letter of thanks {{and get it}} done. I’ll dictate, and you can scribble it down. ‘Dear Mrs. Froplinson—thank you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> {{so much for the}} very pretty calendar you sent us. It was very good of you to think of us.’” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then own {{two things}} to me; that you did love me once, <b>and</b> that <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> is unkind to you often enough now to make {{you think of the}} time when you cared for me.' ...|$|R

"I {{need not}} say, madam," [...] Terence said, [...] "how truly thankful we both are for <b>your</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> kindness, shown to us strangers; and I {{sincerely}} {{hope that you}} will have no cause to regret it. You may be sure of one thing: that if we are recaptured, we shall never say how our escape was effected, nor where we were sheltered afterwards; and if, after the war is over, we can find an opportunity of showing how grateful we are for your kindness, we shall not miss the chance." ...|$|R
