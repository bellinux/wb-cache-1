As a result, utilisation of more renewable resources and promotion of a clean transport system {{such as the use of}} Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) became the forefront of the new energy policies. However, the breakthrough of PHEVs in the <b>automotive</b> <b>fleet</b> increases concerns around the stability of power system and in particular, the power network. This research simulates the aggregate load profile of the UK with presence of PHEVs based upon different price scenarios. The results show that under the fixed rate and time of use programmes in the current grid, the extra load of the electric vehicles intensifies the consumption profile and also creates new critical points. Thus, there should always be excess standby capacity to satisfy peak demand even for a short period of time. On the other hand, when the consumers do not pay the price based on the actual cost of supply, those who consume less in peak hours subsidise the ones who consume more and this cross subsidy raises a regulatory issue. On the contrary, a smart grid can accommodate PHEVs without creating technical and regulatory problems. This positive consequence is the result of demand response to the real time pricing. From a technical point of view, the biggest chunk of PHEVs' load will be shifted to the late evening and the hours of minimum demand. Besides, from a welfare analysis standpoint, real time pricing creates no deadweight losses and corresponding demand response will limit the ability of suppliers to increase the spot market clearing price above its equilibrium level...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{accelerate}} the electrification of the <b>automotive</b> <b>fleet,</b> the energy density and power density limitations of commercial Li-ion battery cathodes (layered LiMO 2) must be overcome. In this thesis, we use ab initio methods to gain critical insights on two important classes of alternative Li-ion battery cathodes, namely high-capacity Li-excess cation-disordered rocksalts and high-rate LiFePO 4 In {{the first part of}} this thesis (Chapters 3 and 4), we provide the first voltage-based design rules for high-capacity cation-disordered rocksalts. We demonstrate that, depending on the transition metal species, cation disorder can increase or decrease the average voltage of lithium transition metal oxides, and hence increase or decrease the total energy density of these compounds In particular, the disordered Ni 3 +/ 4 + voltage is found to be high (~ 4. 4 V), value at which it is likely to be preceded by oxygen activity. We further investigate the effect of cation-disorder on the voltage slope of lithium transition metal oxides, which controls the total capacity accessible below the stability limit of the electrolyte. We demonstrate that cation-disorder increases the voltage slope by increasing the Li site energy distribution and by enabling Li occupation of high-voltage tetrahedral sites. We further demonstrate that the voltage slope increase upon disorder is smaller for high-voltage transition metals, and that short-range ordering and Liexcess contribute in reducing the inaccessible capacity at high voltage upon disorder. In the second part of this thesis (Chapter 5), we resolve the apparent paradox between the high Li diffusivity in phase-separating LiFePO 4 and the persistence of thermodynamically unstable solid-solution states during (dis) charge at low to moderate C-rates. We demonstrate that, even under rate conditions such that relaxation to a two-phase state is kinetically possible, the thermodynamically favorable state in a single particle is not a sharp interface but rather a diffuse interface with an intermediate solid-solution region that occupies a significant fraction of the particle volume. Our results not only explain the persistence of solid-solution regions at low to moderate C-rates in nano-LiFePO 4, but also explain the observations of stable intermediate solid-solution states at an ac interface in particles quenched from a solid solution. by Aziz Abdellahi.

40|$|As {{the share}} of hybrid, plug-in hybrid (PHEV), {{electric}} (EV) and fuel-cell (FCV) vehicles grows in the national <b>automotive</b> <b>fleet,</b> an entirely new set of diagnostic and technical skills needs to be obtained by the maintenance workforce. Electrically-powered vehicles require new diagnostic tools, technique and vocabulary when compared to existing internal combustion engine-powered models. While the manufacturers of these new vehicles train their own maintenance personnel, training for students, independent working technicians and fleet operators is less focused and organized. This DOE-funded effort provided training to these three target groups to help expand availability of skills and to provide more competition (and lower consumer cost) in the maintenance of these hybrid- and electric-powered vehicles. Our approach was to start locally in the San Francisco Bay Area, one of the densest markets in the United States for these types of automobiles. We then expanded training to the Los Angeles area and then out-of-state to identify what types of curriculum was appropriate and what types of problems were encountered as training was disseminated. The fact that this effort trained up to 800 individuals with sessions varying from 2 - day workshops to full-semester courses is considered a successful outcome. Diverse programs were developed to match unique time availability and educational needs {{of each of the}} three target audiences. Several key findings and observations arising from this effort include: • Recognition that hybrid and PHEV training demand is immediate; demand for EV training is starting to emerge; while demand for FCV training is still over the horizon • Hybrid and PHEV training are an excellent starting point for all EV-related training as they introduce all the basic concepts (electric motors, battery management, controllers, vocabulary, testing techniques) that are needed for all EVs, and these skills are in-demand in today’s market. • Faculty training is widely available and can be relatively quickly achieved. Equipment availability (vehicles, specialized tools, diagnostic software and computers) is a bigger challenge for funding-constrained colleges. • A computer-based emulation system that would replicate vehicle and diagnostic software in one package is a training aid that would have widespread benefit, but does not appear to exist. This need is further described at the end of Section 6. 5. The benefits of this project are unique to each of the three target audiences. Students have learned skills they will use for the remainder of their careers; independent technicians can now accept customers who they previously needed to turn away due to lack of familiarity with hybrid systems; and fleet maintenance personnel are able to lower costs by undertaking work in-house that they previously needed to outsource.

40|$|Esta dissertação aborda a espacialização dos acidentes de trânsito notificados entre os anos de 2005 e 2013 nos municípios de Fundão, Serra, Vitória, Cariacica, Vila Velha, Viana e Guarapari, que juntos compõem a Região Metropolitana da Grande Vitória (RMGV). Para o cumprimento deste propósito, realizou-se um diagnóstico {{temporal}} e espacial dos acidentes de trânsito ocorridos nessa região, analisando-se o acelerado crescimento da frota veicular, a situação da atual infraestrutura viária e o crescimento demográfico. Além disso, foram listadas as principais variáveis de risco responsáveis por ocasionar acidentes de trânsito. Quanto à fundamentação teórica, foi construída a partir da Geografia dos Transportes, que forneceu subsídios para contextualizar a importância da análise espacial geográfica sobre o fenômeno aqui tratado. Na sequência, estimaram-se os custos gerados por esse fenômeno, chegando à cifra de mais de R$ 900 milhões de custos associados aos acidentes de trânsito da RMGV em 2013. Utilizando-se de técnicas de geoestatística e de geoprocessamento, identificaram-se as áreas de concentração de acidentes de trânsito na RMGV, conforme as tipologias de colisões e choques, capotamentos e tombamentos e atropelamentos. Logrou-se, como conclusão, que 1) além do crescimento em quantidade e concentração das ocorrências, houve também, no decorrer da série histórica, o espraiamento dos registros de acidentes de trânsito na RMGV, e 2) os acidentes, conforme sua tipologia, concentram-se em diferentes áreas da região estudada.

40|$|Despite growing energy {{security}} and environmental concerns about {{dependence on oil}} as a transportation fuel, gasoline remains the overwhelmingly dominant fuel used by the US <b>automotive</b> <b>fleet.</b> Numerous previous efforts to introduce alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) fueled by hydrogen, biofuels and electricity have failed, and significant barriers to a rapid transition to AFVs remain. One technology that has achieved considerable success in the US is the gasoline hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV), which integrate gasoline and electric powertrain components to significantly improve the efficiency of gasoline use. Since their introduction in 1999, over 2 million HEVs have been sold in the US, with more than 30 HEV models available to consumers today. In this dissertation I explore the dynamics of adoption of HEVs, examining factors influencing consumer adoption of HEVs to date, and, looking forward, the role of HEVs in the emerging market for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In Essay 1, I examine the market for the iconic Toyota Prius HEV. While more than 1 million Prius vehicles have been sold in the US, this market has been characterized by long wait lists at Toyota dealerships, evidence of supply constraints influencing the diffusion process. The innovation diffusion literature says relatively little about supply constraints, representing diffusion as a fundamentally demand-side process. Here I develop a model of innovation diffusion that incorporates production capacity and dealer inventory. Inclusion of supply constraints improves the explanatory power of the model in the Prius case, and demonstrates that the failure to model supply constraints can bias diffusion model parameter estimates. Essay 2 is motivated by the observation that Prius sales are not uniform geographically. Sales of the Prius have clustered in regions such as the West Coast, around Washington DC and through New England, with many fewer sales of the Prius {{in the south and}} mid-west. I propose two alternative hypotheses to explain the emergence of these clusters: 1) contagion through consumers' social networks; and 2) market heterogeneity that influences consumers' adoption thresholds. I develop a model of spatial innovation diffusion that captures spatial information generation between regions and consumer discrete choice between technologies. I find that in the Prius case, adoption clustering is explained by social contagion at the local level, which amplifies heterogeneous adoption thresholds. In Essay 3, I explore the future role of HEVs as a transitional technology in the emerging market for plug-in EVs, which hold the potential to achieve deep cuts in oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The technology strategy literature suggests that hybrids technologies help the transition to radical technologies, accumulating producer learning, consumer familiarity and complementary assets that spillover to the radical technology. However, EVs remain expensive, have a limited electric range and lack a ubiquitous recharging infrastructure, while HEVs are relatively cheaper and refuel from the existing gasoline refueling infrastructure. I develop a model of hybrid and electric vehicle diffusion with multiple competing entrants, finding that the smooth transition from HEVs to EVs is possible but not assured, identifying public policy and firm strategy decisions that have the potential to accelerate this transition. by David Ross Keith.
