Many researches have been conducted to remove heavy metals using different materials. Various adsorbents have been used to remove different type of heavy metal ions from wastewater especially those that are harmful to mankind. Activated carbons, plant or lignocellulosic wastes, clays and biopolymers are the most common adsorbents used. For this research, chitosan was used as a adsorbent to remove copper and zinc from wastewater. Chitosan, a type of biopolymer, is a good adsorbent to remove the heavy metal ions from wastewater. The synthetic wastewater was prepared in the laboratory to conduct the experiments. Batch experiments were conducted to obtain the optimum conditions for copper and zinc. Effect of parameter like pH, adsorbent dose, contact time, temperature and initial metal ion concentration were also determined. The optimum conditions obtained were 360 min contact time, 200 mg adsorbent dose and pH 5 for copper and 180 min contact time, 200 mg adsorbent dose and pH 7 for zinc. Adsorption behavior could be described using the Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm model. Adsorption data was well fitted in Langmuir isotherm model for both metals. The maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 89 % for copper and 96. 97 % for zinc. The kinetics of adsorption could describe using pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic model.

In this study, a decision support system (DSS) based on multi-criteria analysis (MCA) was created to compare processes for OMPs removal under various criteria. Multi-criteria analysis (MCA), a transparent and reliable procedure, was adopted. Models were built for both experimental and predicted percent-removals {{for a range of}} OMPs reflecting different physicochemical properties.

Analytical methods to detect OMPs in water are very laborious, thus a modeling approach such as QSAR is an attractive option.

We studied the surface layer of a Luvisol with markedly different total concentrations of inorganic P as the result of different P fertilizer history (i. e. massive or no application for 40 years). Soil pH was made to vary from acid to alkaline. Soil solutions were extracted with water and CaCl 2 (0. 01 M). The occurrence of montmorillonite led us to determine the binding properties of P and Ca ions for this clay mineral. Satisfactory results were obtained using generic values for model parameters and soil-specific ones, which were either determined directly by measurements or estimated from the literature. We showed that adsorption largely controlled the variations of DIP concentration and that, because of kinetic constrains, only little Ca-phosphates may be precipitated under alkaline conditions, particularly in the P fertilized treatment. The mineral-P pool initially present in both P treatments did not dissolve significantly during the course of the experiments. The adsorption of Ca ions onto soil minerals also promoted adsorption of P ions through electrostatic interactions. The intensity of <b>the</b> mechanism <b>was</b> high under neutral to alkaline conditions. Changes in DIP concentration as a function of these environmental variables can be related to changes in the contribution of the various soil minerals to P adsorption. The extra P adsorbed in the fertilized treatment compared with <b>the</b> control treatment <b>was</b> mainly adsorbed onto illite. This clay mineral <b>was</b> <b>the</b> major P-fixing constituent from neutral to alkaline pH conditions, because the repulsion interactions between deprotonated hydroxyl surface sites and P ions were sufficiently counterbalanced by Ca ions.

Biological systems {{take advantage of their}} impact on fluids with interfaces, but surfactants are also important for industrial applications such as processes of emulsification or mixing. Surfactants can be soluble in {{at least one of the}} fluid phases and the exchange of surfactants between the bulk phases and <b>the</b> fluid interfaces <b>is</b> governed by <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of adsorption and desorption. One can compute the interfacial surfactant density from the bulk surfactant density by assuming that <b>the</b> interface <b>is</b> in equilibrium with the adjacent bulk phase and imposing a closure relation (known as adsorption isotherm) between the two quantities. The assumption (known as instantaneous <b>adsorption)</b> <b>is</b> valid when <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of <b>adsorption</b> to <b>the</b> interface <b>is</b> fast compared to the kinetics in the bulk phases. However, it is not valid in the context of ionic surfactant systems, or when <b>the</b> diffusion <b>is</b> not limited to a thin layer.

Via a formal asymptotic analysis, we show the phase field models are related to sharp interface models in the limit that the interfacial width tends to zero. Flexibility with respect to the choice of bulk and surface free energies allows us to realise various isotherms and relations of state between surface tension and surfactant. We present some numerical simulations to support the asymptotic analysis and display the effectiveness of the our approach. As a first step towards an analysis of our models, we consider sharp interface and phase field models for soluble surfactants in a static situation.
