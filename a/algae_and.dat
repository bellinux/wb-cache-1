5|$|On the {{submarine}} {{portion of the}} island, many marine species are found. Starfish are abundant, as are sea urchins and limpets.

5|$|The {{burial of}} <b>algae</b> <b>and</b> {{bacteria}} below the mud {{of the sea}} floor during this time resulted {{in the formation of}} North Sea oil and natural gas, much of it trapped in overlying sandstone by deposits formed as the seas fell to form the swamps and salty lakes and lagoons that were home to dinosaurs.|$|E

25|$|In {{some groups}} of mixotrophic protists, like some {{dinoflagellates}} (e.g. Dinophysis), chloroplasts {{are separated from}} a captured <b>alga</b> <b>and</b> used temporarily. These klepto chloroplasts may only have a lifetime of {{a few days and}} are then replaced.|$|R

5|$|The tadpoles feed on detritus, <b>algae,</b> <b>and</b> bacteria. Tadpoles in more {{advanced}} phases of development may show {{a preference for}} vegetable matter, but also scavenge or become carnivorous on aquatic life. Captive tadpoles have eaten boiled lettuce and pet food in pellet form. If population density is high, tadpoles have cannibalised one another.|$|E
5|$|Animals as a {{category}} have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists. They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae. They are also distinguished from plants, <b>algae,</b> <b>and</b> fungi by lacking cell walls.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding {{capabilities}} extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic <b>algae,</b> <b>and</b> therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, strombid {{gastropods}} {{were believed}} to be carnivores. This erroneous conception was based on the writings of French naturalist Jean Baptiste Lamarck, whose classification scheme grouped strombids with carnivorous sea snails. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving beyond doubt that strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Laevistrombus canarium is known to be a herbivore, feeding on <b>algae</b> <b>and</b> occasionally detritus.|$|E

The biofuel blend included components derived from <b>algae</b> <b>and</b> jatropha plants. The algae oil was provided by Sapphire Energy, and the jatropha oil by Terasol Energy.|$|E
5|$|In nature, free oxygen is {{produced}} by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis. According to some estimates, green <b>algae</b> <b>and</b> cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on Earth, and the rest {{is produced}} by terrestrial plants. Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's atmospheric oxygen each year.|$|E

5|$|In plants, <b>algae,</b> <b>and</b> cyanobacteria, photosystem II uses {{light energy}} to remove {{electrons}} from water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The electrons then {{flow to the}} cytochrome b6f complex, which uses their energy to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast. These protons move back through the membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through photosystem I and can then either be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP+, {{for use in the}} Calvin cycle, which is discussed below, or recycled for further ATP generation.|$|E
5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} {{lives on}} muddy and sandy bottoms, grazing on <b>algae</b> <b>and</b> detritus. It is gonochoristic and sexually dimorphic, depending on internal fertilization for spawning. Larvae {{of this species}} spend several days as plankton, undergoing a series of transformations until they reach complete metamorphosis. The maximum life span is 2 to 2.5 years. Predators of this snail include carnivorous gastropods such as cone snails and volutes. It is also a prey species for vertebrates including macaques, and also humans, who consume the soft parts {{in a wide variety}} of dishes.|$|E
5|$|Malaria parasites contain apicoplasts, organelles {{usually found}} in plants, {{complete}} {{with their own}} genomes. These apicoplasts {{are thought to have}} originated through the endosymbiosis of <b>algae</b> <b>and</b> {{play a crucial role in}} various aspects of parasite metabolism, such as fatty acid biosynthesis. Over 400 proteins have been found to be produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel anti-malarial drugs.|$|E

5|$|Prokaryotes {{inhabited}} the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago.

The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes.
