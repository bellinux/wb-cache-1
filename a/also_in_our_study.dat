30|$|Among the fluoroquinolones, {{ciprofloxacin}} {{is generally}} {{the most effective}} drug against Pseudomonas. Other bacteria like Salmonella, Shigella, Neisseria, and Haemophilus are highly susceptible to ciprofloxacin {{regardless of whether the}} organisms produce β-lactamase or not [21]. The susceptibility profile of ciprofloxacin is reportedly superior to ceftazidime for Gram-negative organisms [1, 2, 22]. Resistance to fluoroquinolones in general and to ciprofloxacin in particular is reportedly low [23 – 25]. <b>Also,</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>study,</b> ciprofloxacin was the drug of choice against Gram-negative bacteria [26]. In our database, out of the 65 cases of Gram-negative bacterial postoperative endophthalmitis, 77 % isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, and in the current series, nearly 42 % of Gram-negative bacteria that were resistant to both ceftazidime and amikacin showed susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Since the elimination half-life of intravitreal ciprofloxacin is short [27], oral administration may be considered in such patients. The intravitreal concentration of ciprofloxacin after oral administration has been demonstrated to be above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC- 90, i.e., minimum antibiotic concentration inhibiting 90 % of strains) of most of the organisms in inflamed eyes [28].|$|E

30|$|The main outcome results {{concerning}} intra- {{and postoperative}} complications are {{at variance with}} other published reports. The most dreaded complication—the risk of ureteric lesions—has repeatedly {{been shown to be}} increased applying the laparoscopic hysterectomy technique as compared to abdominal procedures [1, 2, 16, 21]. In contrast, we demonstrate that the laparoscopic approach is associated with a very low incidence of these complications discussed. We describe the development and consequent application of a uterine device designed to facilitate the single operation steps increasing especially the safety of the operation technique. The following step-by-step operation protocol as described here is essential to achieve the results presented for fast operation times with low incidences of complications. Every potential “dangerous” step of the operation procedure, e.g. the dissection of the uterine vessels, is performed in direct contact with the surgical platform. The device is designed to remove the bladder and ureter far away from the dissection plane. Our LH method is an intrafascial technique. This is also essential to increase the safety of the operation. Intrafascial detachment of the cervix decreases the risk for ureteral and/or bladder injuries even under difficult conditions, e.g. large uteri or the situation of a frozen pelvis. As described, {{there is no need for}} dissection of the bladder from the vagina; this is another advantage using this technique. In our study population, eight bladder lesions (0.6 %) occurred in patients with scarring of the lower uterine segment after caesarean section. This is in accordance with published data for AH and VH and does, <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>study</b> population, not show any statistically significant difference when compared to the AH and VH groups. Our results are also supported by the recent published data of a large series of LH demonstrating no association with an increase of major complication rates [7].|$|E

30|$|Infections {{remain a}} serious {{complication}} of renal transplantation. Pathogens could be {{transmitted to the}} recipient {{through a number of}} sources including the PF used to perfuse the kidney following donor nephrectomy (Fisher et al. 2009; Sharma et al. 2005; Sauget et al. 2011; Bucholz et al. 1985). At present, with the exception of fungi contamination where there is a general consensus to treat the patient with an appropriate antifungal therapy based on PF-culture, it remains unclear whether a preemptive antibiotic therapy could lead to a reduction in the rate of infectious complications in case of PF contaminated by bacteria (Fisher et al. 2009; Matignon et al. 2008). In this retrospective study aimed to evaluate the rate of contaminated PF in our center and the impact of the preemptive therapy on the rate of PF-related infections, we found first of all a high percentage of contaminated PF together with an extremely low rate of infections PF-related. As reported by other authors (Sharma et al. 2005; Sauget et al. 2011), <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>study</b> we found a majority of less pathogenic bacteria, such as staphylococci in positive PF. Nevertheless, a relevant number of bacteria considered highly pathogenic such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-negative bacilli were found as well in our study. Consistently with the results of some recent reports, the high percentage of PF contaminated by skin contaminants such as coagulase-negative staphylococci may be due to i) the handling of the kidneys during the procurement process taking into account that all donors were multi-organ, and ii) the advances in microbiological detection that became more sensitive during the last years (Wakelin et al. 2005; Sauget et al. 2011). Until December 2011 we adopted a preemptive antibiotic treatment based on PF-culture according to Sharma et al. (2005) that suggested a preemptive therapy in the case of lactose fermenting coliform or yeast and to Fisher et al. (2009) that extended the preemptive treatment also for less virulent organisms. Starting from January 2012 to December 2012, we did not adopt a preemptive therapy in case of PF contaminated by bacteria based on the following two issues. Firstly, the results of the analysis of the data regarding the infectious complications collected in our center during January 2010 and December 2011 showed that only 1  % of the recipients who received a graft with a contaminated PF have developed an infection. Secondly, the increase of antibiotic resistant bacteria including carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens recently isolated in our hospital. Nevertheless, the inflammatory markers were screened daily until normalization together with a careful physical examination performed every day in recipients receiving a kidney with a positive PF for bacteria.|$|E

No association was found between CGG repeats of intermediate size and POI compared with controls. CGG repeats in the FMR 1 gene in the premutation range (55 - 200 repeats) have consistenly associated with POI. Intermediate range CGG repeats have been considered for a potential association with POI. A case-control study in 375 well-phenotyped Dutch women diagnosed with POI and 3368 controls with natural menopause a parts per thousand yen 40 years of age. The FMR 1 CGG repeat number was determined by PCR amplification in women diagnosed with POI and women with a known age at natural menopause a parts per thousand yen 40 years. The prevalence of intermediate sized CGG repeats (45 - 54 repeats) was compared between POI cases and controls using Fisher's exact test. Differences in mean CGG repeat lengths on allele 1 and allele 2 between POI cases and controls were tested using analysis of variance. The frequency of intermediate sized CGG repeats on the allele with the longest triple repeat number was not statistically significantly different between POI cases and controls (2. 7 and 3. 8 %, respectively, odds ratio 0. 72, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 38 - 1. 39, P = 0. 38). In women with POI, linear regression analysis for age at POI diagnosis and CGG repeat size also failed to show any association (beta = - 0. 018, P = 0. 74). FMR 1 CGG repeat lengths in POI cases and controls were genotyped in two different laboratories. The distributions of CGG repeats may vary among the different ethnic populations in our study. <b>Also,</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>study</b> women with primary amenorrhea (N = 17) {{were included in the}} POI group.

40|$|Dear Editors, we {{have read}} with {{interest}} the paper by Regueiro et al (1) regarding long term Infliximab (IFX) use as maintenance therapy to prevent Crohn’s disease (CD) recurrence after ileo-colonic resection. This study is the continuation of a previous randomized, two armed trial, that evaluated the rate of endoscopic recurrence at one year after surgery, in patients randomized to IFX or placebo. The proportion of endoscopic recurrence was lower in the IFX group compared with placebo (9 % vs. 85 %) (2). In the current open-label study, the same patients, according to their endoscopic findings at one year, were given the option to continue, to stop, or to start IFX therapy. Then patients were followed for at least 5 years after surgery. Patients on long-term IFX therapy, irrespective of original assignment to IFX or placebo, presented higher rate of endoscopic remission and lower rate of surgical recurrence compared with other patients during the whole follow-up period. These data are important because confirm that starting anti-TNFα immediately after surgery (3 - 5) or shortly after endoscopic recurrence (6 - 7) permits to obtain a low recurrence rate in the long-term. Moreover, the Authors demonstrated that early anti-TNFα treatment is associated to a lower need for additional surgery compared to patients who started the treatment in response to endoscopic recurrence. This study is particularly relevant considering the paucity of data currently available in medical literature {{on the role of}} anti-TNFα drugs in the post-surgical setting. However, not all the data available in literature have been quoted as we have recently published the first randomized three armed study evaluating the rate of endoscopic recurrence at two years follow-up in patients treated with Adalimumab (ADA), azathioprine or mesalamine. <b>Also</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>study,</b> the rate of endoscopic recurrence was significantly lower in ADA group compared with azathioprine and mesalamine, (6. 3 % vs. 64. 7 % vs. 83. 3 %, respectively (8). Moreover, we provided a follow-up period of two years with detailed clinical, radiologic and endoscopic data at 1 and 2 years after surgery and, further, we directly compared the anti-TNFα treatment with the most traditional drugs, such as mesalamine and azathioprine. Therefore our data and those published by Regueiro et al confirm that patients with risk factors for disease recurrence and additional surgery, such as cigarette smoking, young age, ileocolonic involvement, penetrating/fistulizing disease behavior, early immunomodulator administration and short disease duration before surgery should be considered to start treatment with anti TNFα shortly after surger...|$|E
