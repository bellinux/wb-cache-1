5|$|The {{range of}} social {{scientific}} methods has also expanded. Social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-twentieth century led to increasingly interpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophic approaches towards the analysis of society. Conversely, {{the end of the}} 1990s and the beginning of 2000s have seen the rise of new analytically, mathematically and computationally rigorous techniques, such as <b>agent-based</b> modelling and social network analysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Agent-based</b> modeling.|$|E
25|$|These {{approaches}} {{include both}} compartmental models and <b>agent-based</b> models.|$|E
25|$|CAS are {{occasionally}} modeled {{by means}} of <b>agent-based</b> models and complex network-based models. <b>Agent-based</b> models are developed {{by means of}} various methods and tools primarily by means of first identifying the different agents inside the model. Another method of developing models for CAS involves developing complex network models by means of using interaction data of various CAS components.|$|E
25|$|With this assumption, the <b>agent-based</b> model could {{reproduce}} the ladder-like phylogeny of influenza A/H3N2's HA protein.|$|E
25|$|Later work by Ferguson {{and colleagues}} adopted an <b>agent-based</b> {{approach}} to better identify the immunological and ecological determinants of influenza evolution.|$|E
25|$|AnyLogic {{models can}} {{be based on}} any of the main {{simulation}} modeling paradigms: discrete event or process-centric (DE), systems dynamics (SD), and <b>agent-based</b> (AB).|$|E
25|$|AnyLogic is a multimethod {{simulation}} {{modeling tool}} developed by The AnyLogic Company (former XJ Technologies). It supports <b>agent-based,</b> discrete event, and system dynamics simulation methodologies. AnyLogic PLE edition {{is available for}} free for self-educational and educational purposes.|$|E
25|$|In recent work, Bedford {{and colleagues}} used an <b>agent-based</b> model {{to show that}} {{evolution}} in a Euclidean antigenic space can account for the phylogenetic pattern of influenza A/H3N2's HA, {{as well as the}} virus's antigenic, epidemiological, and geographic patterns.|$|E
25|$|A {{landscape}} with structure and pattern implies {{that it has}} spatial heterogeneity, or the uneven distribution of objects across the landscape. Heterogeneity {{is a key element}} of landscape ecology that separates this discipline from other branches of ecology. Landscape heterogeneity is able to quantify with <b>agent-based</b> methods as well.|$|E
25|$|How, precisely, do {{systems of}} vowels, consonants and syllables arise? <b>Agent-based</b> {{computer}} models take {{the perspective of}} self-organisation {{at the level of}} the speech community or population. The two main paradigms here are (1) the iterated learning model and (2) the language game model. Iterated learning focuses on transmission from generation to generation, typically with just one agent in each generation.|$|E
25|$|Computational {{sociology}} {{is influenced}} {{by a number of}} micro-sociological areas as well as the macro-level traditions of systems science and systems thinking. The micro-level influences of symbolic interaction, exchange, and rational choice, along with the micro-level focus of computational political scientists, such as Robert Axelrod, helped to develop computational sociology's , <b>agent-based</b> approach to modeling complex systems. This is what Joshua M. Epstein calls generative science. Other important areas of influence include statistics, mathematical modeling and computer simulation.|$|E
25|$|Computer {{graphics}} are {{now used}} to build virtual 3D models of sites, such as the throne room of an Assyrian palace or ancient Rome. Photogrammetry is also used as an analytical tool, and digital topographical models have been combined with astronomical calculations to verify whether or not certain structures (such as pillars) were aligned with astronomical {{events such as the}} sun's position at a solstice. <b>Agent-based</b> modeling and simulation can be used to better understand past social dynamics and outcomes. Data mining can be applied to large bodies of archaeological 'grey literature'.|$|E
25|$|A city {{simulator}} {{can be a}} city-building {{game but}} {{can also be a}} tool used by urban planners to understand how cities are likely to evolve in response to various policy decisions. AnyLogic is an example of modern, large-scale urban simulators designed for use by urban planners. City simulators are generally <b>agent-based</b> simulations with explicit representations for land use and transportation. UrbanSim and LEAM are examples of large-scale urban simulation models that are used by metropolitan planning agencies and military bases for land use and transportation planning.|$|E
25|$|Because {{ecological}} systems are typically nonlinear, they often cannot be solved analytically {{and in order}} to obtain sensible results, nonlinear, stochastic and computational techniques must be used. One class of computational models that is becoming increasingly popular are the <b>agent-based</b> models. These models can simulate the actions and interactions of multiple, heterogeneous, organisms where more traditional, analytical techniques are inadequate. Applied theoretical ecology yields results which are used in the real world. For example, optimal harvesting theory draws on optimization techniques developed in economics, computer science and operations research, and is widely used in fisheries.|$|E
25|$|Swarm {{algorithms}} {{follow a}} Lagrangian approach or an Eulerian approach. The Eulerian approach views the swarm as a field, {{working with the}} density of the swarm and deriving mean field properties. It is a hydrodynamic approach, and can be useful for modelling the overall dynamics of large swarms. However, most models work with the Lagrangian approach, which is an <b>agent-based</b> model following the individual agents (points or particles) that make up the swarm. Individual particle models can follow information on heading and spacing that is lost in the Eulerian approach.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Crichton {{published}} Prey, {{a cautionary}} tale about developments in science and technology; specifically nanotechnology. The novel explores relatively recent phenomena engendered {{by the work of}} the scientific community, such as artificial life, emergence (and by extension, complexity), genetic algorithms, and <b>agent-based</b> computing. Reiterating components in many of his other novels, Crichton once again devises fictional companies, this time Xymos, a nanorobotics company which is claimed {{to be on the verge}} of perfecting a revolutionary new medical imaging technology based on nanotechnology and a rival company, MediaTronics.|$|E
25|$|Complex {{social network}} {{analysis}} is used to study the dynamics of large, complex social networks. Dynamic network analysis brings together traditional {{social network analysis}}, link analysis and multi-agent systems within network science and network theory. Through the use of key concepts and methods in social network analysis, <b>agent-based</b> modeling, theoretical physics, and modern mathematics (particularly graph theory and fractal geometry), this method of inquiry brought insights into the dynamics and structure of social systems. New computational methods of localized social network analysis {{are coming out of}} the work of Duncan Watts, Albert-László Barabási, Nicholas A. Christakis, Kathleen Carley and others.|$|E
