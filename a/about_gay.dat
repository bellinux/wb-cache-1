40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} {{whether and how}} social consensus affects the way perceivers encode information concerning a deviant member of a stereotyped group. Participants formed an impression of a gay person described by means of {{both positive and negative}} behaviours. Participants also learned that they had to communicate their impression to an unidentified audience whose stereotype <b>about</b> <b>gays</b> was unknown or to an ingroup audience which was presented to be either positive or negative <b>about</b> <b>gays.</b> Results indicated that participants who ignored the identity of the audience and its position towards gays devoted more time to examine the information than participants who had been informed about the audience and its opinion <b>about</b> <b>gays.</b> More importantly, participants spent less (more) time to encode information that was in line (at odds) with the stereotype of the audience. Results are discussed in terms of the interplay between cognitive and social factors in general, and of recent evidence about inconsistency-resolution effect and consensual beliefs in particular.

25|$|The {{widespread}} {{construction of}} public swimming pools from the 1970s gave Singapore the highest density of public pools {{per unit area}} in the world.

500|$|Cyberpunk, a genre arising in the mid-1980s, {{has been}} seen as heteronormative and {{masculine}} to a large extent, although feminist and [...] "queer" [...] interpretations are mooted by some critics.

Scott has reported that reviewers called some of these works [...] "too gay" [...] for mixing cyberpunk clichés with political themes. Many of Scott's other SF works also contain LGBT themes; she said that she chooses to write <b>about</b> <b>gay</b> themes using SF because these genres allow her to explore situations in which LGBT people are treated better or worse than in reality, and that it also gives an estranging distance for readers averse to such themes, who might otherwise feel accused of similar discriminatory practices as those in the books.|$|E
