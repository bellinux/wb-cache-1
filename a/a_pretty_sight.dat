2500|$|Under {{the command}} of Captain W.S. Hawkins, Loch Vennachar {{departed}} Glasgow in late June 1905 on a routine voyage to Adelaide. She was laden with general cargo including a consignment of 20,000 bricks. On 6 September 1905, Loch Vennachar was overtaken by SS Yongala about 160 {{miles west of the}} Neptune Islands and the captains exchanged [...] "all's well" [...] signals. The Captain of the Yongala recorded that Loch Vennachar presented <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight</b> with her sails in full standing, she sped along with every apparent prospect of reaching her port safely. It was the last known sighting of Loch Vennachar.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah--well. Money's money--very much so--very--I {{always have}} said it. But 'twas <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight</b> for the nation. He {{coloured}} up like any maid, that 'a did.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The moon she shined on Telscombe Tye-- [...] On Telscombe Tye {{at night}} it was-- [...] She saw the smugglers riding by, [...] <b>A</b> very <b>pretty</b> <b>sight</b> it was!' ...|$|R
60|$|After that Geoffrey {{began to}} scold her for running away, {{but she did}} not seem to mind it much, for she sat upon the edge of the couch, her little face resting against his own, <b>a</b> very <b>pretty</b> <b>sight</b> to see.|$|R
6000|$|The epithet [...] "closing" [...] is happily {{applied to}} woods just {{bursting}} into foliage, and the epithet [...] "many-twinkling" [...] is exquisitely {{appropriate to the}} leaves of the aspen, which, when every other tree is still, and the air can hardly be felt to stir, dance up and down incessantly, with an endless play of light and shadow, and rustle as they wave joyously to and fro. Nature scarce affords <b>a</b> <b>prettier</b> <b>sight,</b> or <b>a</b> more soothing sound. These comparisons might be extended through pages, and they are fair examples of Pope's inferiority in a style which was unsuited to his turn of mind, and of which he had never formed adequate ideas.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{were told}} that the yeomanry went along the turnpike road yesterday,' said Anne; 'and they say that they were <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight,</b> and quite soldierly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You wouldn't have Harry go {{to church}} in a dressing-gown and nightcap, Colonel Wolfe? That would be <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight,</b> indeed!" [...] again says Hetty, fiercely.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, my dear, I wouldn't lose such <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight.</b> It does my old eyes {{good to see}} so many fresh young faces. Is {{your husband}} going?' ...|$|E
60|$|He thanked Miss Jane {{with all}} his heart, and she and Ellen soon found a place to hang it up well in his <b>sight.</b> It was <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> bright <b>sight</b> to see her insisting on holding the nail for it, and then playfully pretending to shrink and fancy that Ellen would hammer her fingers.|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} the other ships from Chatham came up, {{and the captain}} told them later that the Earl of Sandwich, who was in command, would weigh anchor in the morning, as the {{contingent}} from London, Chatham, and Sheerness was now complete. Cyril {{thought that he had}} never seen <b>a</b> <b>prettier</b> <b>sight,</b> as the Fleet, consisting of fifty men-of-war, of various sizes, and eight merchant vessels that had been bought and converted into fire-ships, got under way and sailed down the river. That night they anchored off Felixstowe, and the next day proceeded, with a favourable wind, to Yarmouth, where already a great number of ships were at anchor. So far the five Volunteers had taken their meals with the captain, but as the others would be coming on board, they were now to mess below, getting fresh meat and vegetables from the shore as they required them. As to other stores, they resolved to do nothing till the whole party arrived.|$|R
6000|$|Papa is {{very fond}} of animals {{particularly}} of cats, we had a dear [...] little gray kitten once that he named [...] "Lazy" [...] (papa always wears [...] gray to match his hair and eyes) and he would carry him around on [...] his shoulder, it was <b>a</b> mighty <b>pretty</b> <b>sight!</b> the gray cat sound [...] asleep against papa's gray coat and hair. The names that he has [...] given our different cats, are realy remarkably funny, they are [...] namely Stray Kit, Abner, Motley, Fraeulein, Lazy, Bufalo Bill, [...] Cleveland, Sour Mash, and Pestilence and Famine.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight,</b> Lady Greendale. Talk {{about the}} start of race horses, {{it is no more}} to be {{compared}} with it than light to dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|Indeed, {{they were}} <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight,</b> and glistened under the {{sunlight}} like spun silver. [...] "Isn't this tin hollyhock going to seed?" [...] asked the Wizard, bending over the flowers.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] he answered, [...] "he'll {{find the}} missus {{and the kids}} in there and <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight</b> they are; I can't bear to look at them, I can't." ...|$|E
60|$|The boy {{waved the}} fan {{to and fro}} and drove away the buzzing flies {{whenever}} they had the impertinence to come near the baby's face. When they had all flown {{out of the window}} or into distant parts of the room, he bent over the cradle and delighted himself with gazing at the sleeping infant. It was, indeed, <b>a</b> very <b>pretty</b> <b>sight.</b> The little personage in the cradle slumbered peacefully, with its waxen hands under its chin, looking as full of blissful quiet as if angels were singing lullabies in its ear. Indeed, it must have been dreaming about heaven; for, while Ben stooped over the cradle, the little baby smiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "You wouldn't {{stop her}} doing that? Oh, sir," [...] {{and the old}} man spoke with a quiet earnestness which was not without its effect, [...] "just look at her now, like the Good Shepherd with His lambs about His feet, and think whether that's not much too <b>pretty</b> <b>a</b> <b>sight</b> to put an end to, in a poor sinful world like this." ...|$|R
60|$|And, in truth, <b>a</b> very <b>pretty</b> <b>sight</b> it was--enough to {{make any}} one's old {{bachelor}} coat sit very uneasily on him. Indeed, {{there is nothing that}} gives one such a startling idea of the tricks that old Father Time has been playing on us, as to meet some boyish or girlish companions with half a dozen or so of thriving children about them. My old friend, I found, was in essence just what the boy had been. There was the same upright bearing, the same confident, cheerful tone to his voice, and the same fire in his eye; only that the hand of manhood had slightly touched some of the lines of his face, giving them a staidness of expression becoming the man and the father.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{the dear}} lady {{come and see}} <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight?</b> It's Nat {{listening}} with all his heart to Demi {{telling the story of}} the Christ-child, like a little white angel as he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{have yet}} to see if this is worse than an Austrian or Italian festival. See, we can look down from behind this yew tree. It really is <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight</b> from this distance.' ...|$|E
60|$|It was <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight.</b> Joe {{rubbed the}} sleep {{from his eyes}} and drank in the glory of it till 'Frisco Kid {{told him to go}} for'ard and make ready for {{dropping}} the anchor.|$|E
60|$|But {{one must}} not be {{altogether}} unreasonable. When we first came in sight of the lake the rain lifted, and the afternoon sun gushed out upon a world of vineyards. In other words, the vines clothe all the little levels and vast slopes of the mountain-sides as far up as the cold will let the grapes grow. There is literally almost no other cultivation, and it is <b>a</b> very <b>pretty</b> <b>sight.</b> On top of the mountains are the chalets with their kine, and at a certain elevation the milk and the wine meet, while below is {{the water of the}} lake, so good to mix with both. I do not know that the Swiss use it for that purpose, but there are countries where something of the sort would be done.|$|R
60|$|Towards sunset we all {{walked out}} into the podere, pausing a little while to look down into a well that stands on the verge of the lawn. Within the spacious circle of its stone curb was an {{abundant}} growth of maidenhair, forming a perfect wreath of thickly clustering leaves quite round, and trailing its tendrils downward to the water which gleamed beneath. It was <b>a</b> very <b>pretty</b> <b>sight.</b> Mr. Story bent over the well and uttered deep, musical tones, which were reverberated from the hollow depths with wonderful effect, as if a spirit dwelt within there, and (unlike the spirits that speak through mediums) sent him back responses even profounder and more melodious than the tones that awakened them. Such a responsive well as this might have been taken for an oracle in old days.|$|R
60|$|On the 30th of May 1790, <b>a</b> very <b>pretty</b> <b>sight</b> {{was seen}} by the villagers {{assembled}} near the door of Foxholm Church. The sun was bright upon the dewy grass, the air was alive with the murmur of bees and the trilling of birds, the bushy blossoming chestnuts and the foamy flowering hedgerows seemed to be crowding round to learn why the church-bells were ringing so merrily, as Maynard Gilfil, his face bright with happiness, {{walked out of the}} old Gothic doorway with Tina on his arm. The little face was still pale, and there was a subdued melancholy in it, as of one who sups with friends for the last time, and has his ear open for the signal that will call him away. But the tiny hand rested with the pressure of contented affection on Maynard's arm, and the dark eyes met his downward glance with timid answering love.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight,</b> {{after this}} anecdote, {{to see us}} {{sweeping}} out the giant powder. It seemed never to be far enough away. And, after all, it was only some rock pounded for assay.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Twas {{done with}} Indian skill," [...] said the scout, {{laughing}} inwardly, but with vast satisfaction; [...] "and 'twas <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight</b> to behold! Though an arrow is a near shot, and needs {{a knife to}} finish the work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, now {{you must}} accept the whole. There's room {{to give the}} preachers a wide berth, even should they insist on [...] "concluding with prayer," [...] {{and it will be}} <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight.</b> They have the Guards' band coming.' ...|$|E
60|$|Little Daffydowndilly {{believed}} {{what his}} companion said, but was very glad, nevertheless, {{when they were}} {{out of sight of the}} old farmer, who bore such a singular resemblance to Mr. Toil. The two travellers had gone but little farther, when they came to a spot where some carpenters were erecting a house. Daffydowndilly begged his companion to stop a moment; for it was <b>a</b> very <b>pretty</b> <b>sight</b> to see how neatly the carpenters did their work, with their broad-axes, and saws, and planes, and hammers, shaping out the doors, and putting in the window-sashes, and nailing on the clapboards; and he could not help thinking that he should like to take a broad-axe, a saw, a plane, and a hammer, and build a little house for himself. And then, when he should have a house of his own, old Mr. Toil would never dare to molest him.|$|R
60|$|Flora was {{somewhat}} uneasy, but {{the mother was}} looking on smiling, and expressed her delight in the young midshipman; and Mrs. Rivers, while listening gladly to his praises, watched heedfully, and was reassured to see that dancing was as natural to him as everything else; his steps were light as a feather, his movement all freedom and joy, without being boisterous, and his boyish chivalry as <b>pretty</b> <b>a</b> <b>sight</b> as any one could wish to see.|$|R
5000|$|It was <b>a</b> very <b>pretty</b> <b>sight</b> to see <b>a</b> {{flock of}} young ducklings driven along the village streets {{to have their}} one and only swim on a pond; which, taken at the right time, helped them to feather properly. Often the flock spread over the road {{from side to side}} and all traffic had perforce to stop, while, quacking much and ambulating slowly, they passed and the road would then be free. Walter Rose {{describing}} ducks in Haddenham, circa 1925 While ducks are naturally aquatic, swimming can be dangerous to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings always had a trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings would be kept away from bodies of water while they were growing. The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond, as it helped them to feather properly.|$|R
60|$|The arrival was <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight,</b> as {{the aunt}} rejoiced at seeing both her hosts {{at the front}} door to greet her, and as Anna held out her glad arms to the little brother who was the pride of the family.|$|E
60|$|By {{one o'clock}} the long tables were <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight,</b> covered with piles {{of fruit and}} cakes, vases of flowers and little flags, establishments of teacups at intervals, and a bouquet and pretty card at {{every one of the}} plates.|$|E
6000|$|Who fancied what <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sight</b> [...] This Rock {{would be}} if edged around [...] With living Snowdrops? circlet bright! [...] How glorious to this Orchard ground! [...] Who loved the little Rock, and set [...] Upon its Head this Coronet? ...|$|E
60|$|In the West and South {{they have}} a new institution--the Broom Brigade. It is {{composed}} of young ladies who dress in a uniform costume, and go through the infantry drill, with broom in place of musket. It is <b>a</b> very <b>pretty</b> <b>sight,</b> on private view. When they perform on the stage of a theater, in the blaze of colored fires, it must be a fine and fascinating spectacle. I saw them go through their complex manual with grace, spirit, and admirable precision. I saw them do everything which a human being can possibly do with a broom, except sweep. I did not see them sweep. But I know they could learn. What {{they have a}}lready learned proves that. And if they ever should learn, and should go on the war-path down Tchoupitoulas or some of those other streets around there, those thoroughfares would bear a greatly improved aspect in a very few minutes. But the girls themselves wouldn't; so nothing would be really gained, after all.|$|R
60|$|I had strolled out in 'the {{afternoon}} with Cousin Edie and Rob, until {{we found ourselves}} upon the brow of the slope which dips away down to the beach. It {{was late in the}} fall, and the links were all bronzed and faded; but the sun still shone warmly, and a south breeze came in little hot pants, rippling the broad blue sea with white curling lines. I pulled an armful of bracken to make a couch for Edie, and there she lay in her listless fashion, happy and contented; for of all folk that I have ever met, she had the most joy from warmth and light. I leaned on a tussock of grass, with Rob's head upon my knee, and there as we sat alone in peace in the wilderness, even there we saw suddenly thrown upon the waters in front of us the shadow of that great man over yonder, who had scrawled his name in red letters across the map of Europe. There was a ship coming up with the wind, a black sedate old merchant-man, bound for Leith as likely as not. Her yards were square and she was running with all sail set. On the other tack, coming from the north-east, were two great ugly lugger-like craft, with one high mast each, and a big square brown sail. <b>A</b> <b>prettier</b> <b>sight</b> one would not wish than to see the three craft dipping along upon so fair a day. But of a sudden there came a spurt of flame and a whirl of blue smoke from one lugger, then the same from the second, and a rap, rap, rap, from the ship. In a twinkling hell had elbowed out heaven, and there on the waters was hatred and savagery and the lust for blood.|$|R
5000|$|Brunton {{described}} the funeral in his memoirs, 'He was buried {{on the shore}} of a beautiful bay, the whole ship's crew accompanying the coffin. The officers, fellow countrymen of the dead youth, stood in a group at a respectful distance, while the ceremony was proceeding. When it was over they approached, and the Tokio officer made a sympathetic little speech. He finished it by saying that in Japan it was the custom to present flowers to the dead, but as there were none in the locality, he asked permission to place a headstone at the grave, and explained that he had written to his government asking that orders be given to have the tomb carefully preserved and taken care of by the local authorities. Immediately after the funeral ceremony was over, <b>a</b> very <b>pretty</b> <b>sight</b> was presented by quite a number of aged men and women approaching with shrubs and twigs, which they reverently laid on the grave. These proceedings at Hiroshima considerably enhanced the European's opinion of Japanese character, so far at least as kindliness of disposition is concerned.' ...|$|R
