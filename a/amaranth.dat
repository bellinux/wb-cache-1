5|$|Until 1927, {{the exact}} shades of the {{national}} colors were not legally specified. In practice, the actual hue, particularly of red, depended {{on what kind of}} red dye was available. In pre-partition Poland, crimson, due to its high price, was a color associated with the rich and the privileged. It could be obtained from the domestically harvested Polish cochineal, although imported alternatives were also available: kermes from the Mediterranean Basin (hence karmazyn, the Polish name of the color) and Mexican cochineal after the discovery of the New World. Crimson was reserved for the nobility and considered a symbol of the aristocracy, so that karmazyn became synonymous with a magnate. A royal ban on wearing this color could be a form of punishment; in the 14th century, the Nałęcz clan of Greater Poland were forbidden to dress in crimson for their ancestors' complicity in the assassination of King Premislaus in 1296. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, due to the influence of French fashion, crimson was largely replaced with the cheaper <b>amaranth.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Amaranths</b> are an {{important}} group of plants and include grain, vegetable and ornamental types. Despite the economic importance of the <b>amaranths,</b> {{there is very little}} information available about the extent and nature of genetic diversity present in the genus Amaranthus at molecular level. We now report the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles of different species of Amaranthus as well as different accessions of the species. These RAPD analyses have been carried out using 65 arbitrary sequence decamer primers. From the RAPD data, an UPGMA dendrogram illustrating the inter-as well as intra-species relationships has been computed. The putative hybrid origin ofA. dubious from A. hybridus and A. spinosus is also ruled out by the RAPD data. The trends of species relationships amongst the <b>amaranths</b> determined by RAPDs is consistent with their cytogenetic and evolutionary relation-ships that have already been determined...|$|R

This annual fair is dedicated to elaboration of this sweet along with olive products from the area. Over 250 producers of the grain offer their products in various preparations.

We have sequenced the genome and transcriptome of Amaranthus hypochondriacus, a diploid (2 n 5 32) belonging to the order Caryophyllales with an estimated genome size of 466 Mb. Of the 411 linkage single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported for grain <b>amaranths,</b> 355 SNPs (86 %) are repre-sented in the scaffolds and 74 % of the 8. 6 billion bases of the sequenced transcriptome map to the genomic scaffolds. The genome of A. hypochondriacus, codes for at least 24, 829 proteins, shares the paleo-hexaploidy event with species under the superorders Rosids and Asterids, harbours 1 SNP in 1, 000 bases, and contains 13. 76 % of repeat elements. Annotation of all the genes in the lysine biosynthetic pathway using comparative genomics and expression analysis offers insights into the high-lysine phenotype. As the first grain species under Caryophyllales and the first C 4 dicot genome reported, the work presented here will be beneficial in improving crops and in expanding our understanding of angiosperm evolution.
