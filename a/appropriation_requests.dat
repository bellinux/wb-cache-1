25|$|When the war ended, U.S. President McKinley {{appointed}} Charles Herbert Allen as {{the first}} civilian governor of Puerto Rico. Though Allen had a business background, his financial administration of Puerto Rico was strikingly unsound. By ignoring the <b>appropriation</b> <b>requests</b> of the Puerto Rican House of Delegates, refusing to make any municipal, agricultural or small business loans, building roads at double the old costs, and leaving 85% of the school-age population without schools. Instead of making these infrastructure and education investments, Allen raided the Puerto Rican treasury and his administration re-directed the insular budget to no-bid contracts for U.S. businessmen, railroad subsidies for U.S.-owned sugar plantations, and high salaries for U.S. bureaucrats in the island government.|$|E
500|$|When von Engelken {{resigned}} in February 1917, his successor was Raymond T.

[...] Each year, Baker appeared before Congress {{to defend the}} bureau's <b>appropriation</b> <b>requests,</b> and O'Reilly sat behind him. [...] In 1920 and 1921, Baker tried to get Congress to formally designate O'Reilly, who then held the title of executive clerk, as Assistant Director, but without success. After the Harding administration took office, Baker was replaced in 1922 by Frank E. Scobey, one of Harding's Ohio Gang. [...] The new director {{had little interest in}} Mint affairs, and O'Reilly not only supervised the bureau's operations, but was the chief witness before Congress in 1922, defending both the appropriation request and the continuing drive to have herself designated Assistant Director.

40|$|Despite their prevalence, public {{engagement}} with pervasive public displays is typically very low. One method {{for increasing the}} relevance of displayed content (and therefore hopefully improving engagement) is to allow the viewer themselves to affect the content shown on displays they encounter – for example, personalising an existing news feed or invoking a specific application on a display of their choosing. We describe this process as viewer appropriation of public displays. This thesis aims to provide the foundations for appropriation support in future ‘open’ pervasive display networks. Our architecture combines three components: Yarely, a scheduler and media player; Tacita, a system for allowing users to make privacy-preserving <b>appropriation</b> <b>requests,</b> and Mercury, an application store for distributing content. Interface points between components support integration with thirdparty systems; a prime example is the provision of Content Descriptor Sets (CDSs) to describe the media items and constraints that determine what is played at each display. Our evaluation of the architecture is both quantitive and qualitative and includes a mixture of user studies, surveys, focus groups, performance measurements and reflections. Overall we show that it is feasible to construct a robust open pervasive display network that supports viewer appropriation. In particular, we show that Yarely’s thick-client approach enables {{the development of a}} signage system that provides continuous operation even in periods of network disconnection yet is able to respond to viewer <b>appropriation</b> <b>requests.</b> Furthermore, we show that CDSs can be used as an effective means of information exchange in an open architecture. Performance measures indicate that demanding personalisation scenarios can be satisfied, and our qualitative work indicates that both display owners and viewers are positive about the introduction of appropriation into future pervasive display systems...|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) submits an annual congressional justification for the funds and number of staff positions requested. For fiscal year 2002, IRS asked for $ 9. 4 billion and 101, 000 full-time-equivalent (FTE) staff positions.
