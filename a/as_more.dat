5|$|After the war, the {{popularity}} of cinemas waned <b>as</b> <b>more</b> people acquired televisions, and by 1965 there were only 40 cinemas left in Manchester. Cine City was threatened with closure in 1997 when Geoff Henshaw, the owner at the time, died. It was purchased by David Babsky, who kept the cinema open until July 2001, when it closed due to competition from a new multiplex cinema in nearby East Didsbury.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>more</b> {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} the Pacific Northwest in the 1930s and 1940s, civic leaders advocated a system of hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River. They argued that the dams would improve navigation for barge traffic from interior regions to the ocean; provide a reliable source of irrigation for agricultural production; provide electricity for the World War II defense industry; and alleviate the flooding of downriver cities, as occurred in the 1948 destruction of Vanport City, Oregon.|$|E
5|$|As {{the revolt}} and raids were {{occurring}} in Campania, {{which was a}} vacation region {{of the rich and}} influential in Rome, and the location of many estates, the revolt quickly {{came to the attention of}} Roman authorities.

5|$|At {{some point}} during the 1990s, it {{appeared}} that Jackson had become dependent on prescription drugs, mainly painkillers and strong sedatives. The drug use was later linked to second- and third-degree burns he had suffered years before. <b>As</b> <b>more</b> and more difficulty emerged in his life, he gradually became dependent on these drugs, and his health deteriorated. He went into rehabilitation in 1993 with the help of Elizabeth Taylor and Elton John.|$|E

5|$|Cicero {{translated}} Aratus in his youth; he {{made the}} Orion episode half again longer {{than it was in}} the Greek, adding the traditional Latin topos of madness to Aratus's text.

She found that lesbian speakers were judged <b>as</b> sounding <b>more</b> lesbian than straight speakers. Bisexual speakers patterned with lesbians, although there was a slight difference between them which was near statistical significance. Listeners in this experiment also ranked speakers on a scale from masculine to feminine. They perceived the straight speakers <b>as</b> significantly <b>more</b> feminine than the lesbian speakers, and the bisexual speakers <b>as</b> slightly <b>more</b> feminine.|$|R

5|$|Despite its later {{importance}} to Britain, Gibraltar was initially {{seen by the}} British Government <b>as</b> <b>more</b> of a bargaining counter than a strategic asset. Its defences continued to be neglected, its garrisoning was an unwelcome expense, and Spanish pressure threatened Britain's vital overseas trade. On seven separate occasions between 1713 and 1728 the British Government proposed to exchange Gibraltar for concessions from Spain, but on each occasion the proposals were vetoed by the British Parliament following public protests.|$|E
5|$|Falafel {{has become}} popular among vegetarians and vegans, as an {{alternative}} to meat-based street foods, and is now sold in packaged mixes in health-food stores.

In the United States, falafel's versatility has allowed for the reformulating of recipes for meatloaf, sloppy joes and spaghetti and meatballs into vegetarian dishes.|$|E

5|$|Functional {{genomics}} using RNAi is {{a particularly}} attractive technique for genomic mapping and annotation in plants because many plants are polyploid, which presents substantial challenges for more traditional genetic engineering methods.
