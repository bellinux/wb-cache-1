5|$|Most often, of course, the {{predicate}} {{consists of}} a verb. However, there are several types of nominal predicative constructions, {{with or without a}} copula. Auxiliaries that express direction and <b>aktionsart</b> (among other meanings) can with the assistance of a linking converb occupy the immediate postverbal position, e.g. uuž orhison drink- leave- 'drank up'. The next position is filled by converb suffixes in connection with the auxiliary, baj- 'to be', e.g. ter güjž bajna s/he run- be- 'she is running'. Suffixes occupying this position express grammatical aspect, e.g., progressive and resultative. In the next position, participles followed by baj- may follow, e.g., ter irsen bajna s/he come- be- 'he has come'. Here, an explicit perfect and habituality can be marked, which is aspectual in meaning as well. This position may be occupied by multiple suffixes in a single predication, and it can still be followed by a converbal Progressive. The last position is occupied by suffixes that express tense, evidentiality, modality, and aspect.|$|E

40|$|The {{temporal}} {{properties of}} the events expressed by sentences are {{the results of the}} composition of the <b>aktionsarts</b> and the tense-aspect forms. Explanation of how the temporal properties are obtained requires the precise descriptions of the temporal factors in the events as well as the detailed clarification of the composing process of these factors. In order to properly achieve this purpose, formal expressions is one of the means linguistic studies can hopefully choose. This paper aims to present as sophisticated a formalization as possible so as to succeed in explaining the intuitional understanding of the temporal {{properties of the}} events denoted by sentences. 文が表示する事態の時間的特性は、動作態と時制・アスペクト形式の組み合わせによる産物である。時間的特性が得られる過程を説明するためには、事態を構成する時間的要素を正確に記述すると同時に、これらの要素が統合される過程を詳細に解明する必要がある。この目的を適切な形で達成するために、言語研究が期待をもって選択することができる方法の一つとして、形式的表示がある。本稿は、文が表示する事態の時間的な特性が直観的に理解された結果を説明できるようにするための、できるだけ精密な形式化を提示することを目的とする。熊本裕先生退職記念号 Festschrift for Professor Hiroshi KUMAMOTOArticle...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} thesis {{is to provide a}} comprehensive account of the meaning of keep V-ing constructions, see (1 a) and (1 b). (1) a. Mary kept winning (again and again). (1) b. John kept running (for another ten minutes). On the basis of a systematic study of combinations of keep with predicates of different <b>aktionsarts,</b> it is shown that keep can give rise to two different readings which share the overall meaning of ‘continued activity’. It is argued that the two readings of keep V-ing arise from different aspectual properties of the predicate in the complement clause. Under the first reading, labelled the continuative-iterative reading, (1 a), the event in the complement clause is telic, and the interpretation is an iterative reading. Under the second reading, labelled the continuative reading, (1 b), the event in the complement clause is atelic, and the interpretation is a reading of nonstop continuation. It is argued that keep combines with activity predicates in the relevant construction type, that is, with dynamic, durative and atelic events, and that keep has the ability to induce aspect shift when combining with predicates that are not inherent activities. Thus, in (1 a), a punctual and telic winning event is iterated, creating a series which in itself is durative and atelic. In (1 b), the running event is already durative and atelic. By comparing keep V-ing with the progressive construction be V-ing, (2), and with two other continuative constructions, continue V-ing, (3), and V on, (4), it is shown that keep readily shifts a telic predicate into an atelic reading by taking scope over the entire event, (1 a), but cannot take scope over an internal part of a telic event. Both be V-ing, (2), and continue V-ing, (3), are able to take scope over an internal part of a telic event. (2) John was building the house. (3) John continued building the house. (4) John ran on. In addition, unlike continue V-ing and V on, keep V-ing does not necessarily denote continuation of an event which has already been initiated. ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{morphology}} and verb construction types of Kistaniniya which {{is a member of}} the south Ethio-Semitic sub-group. In Ethnologue it is referred to as Soddo. It is a morphologically complex SOV language. This thesis is organized into an introducing chapter and then in two parts. The first chapter provides general introduction to the Kistane people, the phonology and syllable structure of Kistaniniya. Part I, which contains Chapter 2 to Chapter 5, is devoted to describing the morphology of the language. Chapter 2 describes the morphology of nouns and pronouns. Nouns are morphologically inflected for number, gender, definiteness and case. New nouns can be formed by noun formation, noun derivation and compounding. Noun formation is a process of specifying a consonantal root with vowels to form a noun. On the other hand noun derivation uses derivational affixes attached to noun stems and/or words belonging to other lexical categories to derive new nouns. Chapter 3 examines the morphology of adjectives. It is shown that most of the members of the category adjectives are the result of adjective formation as opposed to derivation. Adjectives inflect for the grammatical features number, case and definiteness. Chapter 4 addresses the morphology of adpositions. The discussion covers prepositions, postpositions and circumposition. The prepositions comprise a closed class of five morphemes. Morphologically, postpositions can be simple or complex, and they are frequently used together with prepositions. All circumpositions have the locative morphemes tə- ‘to’ and bə- ‘from’ as their part that precedes the nominal complement, and the second part that follows the nominal complement includes a list of words with nominal or verbal origin. Chapter 5 has 11 sections that address verb morphology. In addition to introductory information about the nature of Kistaniniya verbs provided in the introduction section of the chapter, types of verbs, verb formation and derivations, agreement marking, tense, aspect and <b>aktionsarts,</b> verbal negation, relativization, impersonal verbs, copulas and converbs are the major issues examined in the chapter. Part II consists of Chapters 6 and 7. Chapter 6 gives a detailed description of how the annotation and enumeration system Construction Labelling works. Chapter 7 examines Kistaniniya verb constructions using this system, and categorizes the construction according to their syntactic and semantic features. Finally, Chapter 8 summarizes the discussion and recapitulates the major findings. PhD i språkvitenskapPhD in Linguistic...|$|R

5000|$|The lexical aspect or <b>aktionsart</b> ( [...] , plural aktionsarten [...] ) of a verb {{is a part}} of the way {{in which}} that verb is {{structured}} in relation to time. Any event, state, process, or action which a verb expresses—collectively, any eventuality—may also be said to have the same lexical aspect. Lexical aspect is distinguished from grammatical aspect: lexical aspect is an inherent property of a (semantic) eventuality, whereas grammatical aspect is a property of a (syntactic or morphological) realization. Lexical aspect is invariant, while grammatical aspect can be changed according to the whims of the speaker.|$|E

This idea was first posited by Bernard Comrie in addition to the more commonly known categories such as verbs of Activity, Accomplishment, Achievement, and State. The event represented by a semelfactive verb is punctual (instantaneous, taking just a moment), perfective (treated as a complete action with no explicit internal temporal structure), and atelic (not having an end). Semelfactive verbs include [...] "blink", [...] "sneeze", and [...] "knock".|$|E
50|$|As a result, {{knowledge}} extraction {{is largely}} text-based. The terminological entries {{are composed of}} information from specialized texts as well as specialized language resources. Knowledge is configured and represented in a dynamic conceptual network {{that is capable of}} adapting to new contexts. At the most general level, generic roles of agent, patient, result, and instrument are activated by basic predicate meanings such as make, do, affect, use, become, etc. which structure the basic meanings in specialized texts. From a linguistic perspective, <b>Aktionsart</b> distinctions in texts are based on Van Valin's classification of predicate types. At the more specific levels of the network, the qualia structure of the generative lexicon is used as a basis for the systematic classification and relation of nominal entities.|$|E

5000|$|There is a {{distinction}} between grammatical aspect, as described here, and lexical aspect. Lexical aspect is an inherent property of a verb or verb-complement phrase, and is not marked formally. The distinctions made as part of lexical aspect {{are different from those}} of grammatical aspect. Typical distinctions are between states ("I owned"), activities ("I shopped"), accomplishments ("I painted a picture"), achievements ("I bought"), and punctual, or semelfactive, events ("I sneezed"). These distinctions are often relevant syntactically. For example, states and activities, but not usually achievements, can be used in English with a prepositional for-phrase describing a time duration: [...] "I had a car for five hours", [...] "I shopped for five hours", but not [...] "*I bought a car for five hours". Lexical aspect is sometimes called <b>Aktionsart,</b> especially by German and Slavic linguists. Lexical or situation aspect is marked in Athabaskan languages.|$|E

50|$|Like {{almost all}} Mayan languages, Yucatec Maya is verb-initial. Word order varies between VOS and VSO, with VOS {{being the most}} common. Many {{sentences}} {{may appear to be}} SVO, but this order is due to a topic-comment system similar to that of Japanese. One of the most widely studied areas of Yucatec is the semantics of time in the language. Yucatec, like many other languages of the world (Kalaallisut, arguably Mandarin Chinese, Guaraní and others) does not have the grammatical category of tense. Temporal information is encoded by a combination of aspect, inherent lexical aspect (<b>aktionsart),</b> and pragmatically governed conversational inferences. Yucatec is unusual in lacking temporal connectives such as 'before' and 'after'. Another aspect of the language is the core-argument marking strategy, which is a 'fluid S system' in the typology of Dixon (1994) where intransitive subjects are encoded like agents or patients based upon a number of semantic properties as well as the perfectivity of the event.|$|E

The preverbs {{of position}} 1 {{are few and}} mutually exclusive while those of position 2 make up an open class of particles, of which several may occur in succession. The preverbs of position 1 include subordinating particles like /e:/ or /ka:/ and the preverbs /ka/ and /kita/, which indicate subsequence or futurity. Position 2 preverbs are arranged semantically along a scale from abstract to concrete. Abstract preverbs include /a:ta/ [...] "although, in vain", in ē-āta-kitōtāt [...] "although he spoke to him", and /wi:/ [...] "will, intend to", as in wī-mēscihāwak [...] "they will all be killed". An example of a concrete preverb {{can be found in}} /ka:mwa:ci/ [...] "quietly", in kī-kāmwāci-pimātisiwak , or /ne:wo/ [...] "four" [...] in ē-kī-nēwo-tipiskāyik [...] "when the fourth night passed". [...] Bakker (2006) classes tense as a position 1 preverb but the following mood as both a position 1 and position 2 preverb. Aspect 1 and the <b>Aktionsart</b> are also classified as position 2 preverbs. The difference between Aspect 2 and 3 seems to be that of length, with 2 being durative and 3 being iterative.|$|E
40|$|The article {{summarizes}} the basic questions of <b>aktionsart</b> (the status, content, and {{borders of the}} category) in the Russian language and describes the most relevant views on the problem. In the author’s opinion, the category of <b>aktionsart</b> is a semantic-word formation category, one that includes motivated verbs with formal markers of semantic change of the base verb, except for verbs of motion. Taking into consideration that word formation models are polysemic, the verb classes of <b>aktionsart</b> can be specified not by formal factors but by semantic ones. Consequently, {{the content of the}} category of <b>aktionsart</b> is determined by word formation and semantics together. Another key problem is the connection between the category of <b>aktionsart</b> and category of grammatical aspect and the sphere of word formation. The author joins the opinion of those linguists who consider <b>aktionsart</b> to be the lexical level of the macrocategory of aspect. The category of <b>aktionsart</b> is separated from the sphere of word formation by the regularity of verb formation. Regarding this criteria, as the author suggests, some verb formation models of low regularity should not be acknowledged as verb classes of <b>aktionsart...</b>|$|E

Semantically, on the one hand, there is a clear-cut boundary between states and activities, but morphologically, however, there is no distinction between them.

40|$|Spanish verbs display two past-tense forms, the pretérito and the imperfecto. We {{offer an}} account of the {{semantics}} of these forms within a situation semantics, addressing a number of theoretically interesting questions about how to realize a semantics for tense and events in that type of framework. We argue that each of these forms is unambiguous, and that the apparent variety of readings attested for them derives from interaction with other factors in the course of interpretation. The meaning of the imperfecto is constrained to always reflect atelic <b>aktionsart.</b> In addition, it contains a modal element, and a contextually-given accessibility relation over situations constrains the interpretation of the modal in ways that give rise to all the attested readings. The pretérito is indeterminate with respect to <b>aktionsart,</b> neither telic nor atelic.
