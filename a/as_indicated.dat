30|$|A Paired t-test {{was used}} to analyze {{differences}} in the VBD calculated from FFDM versus DBT. The correlation coefficient (R value) and its 95  % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for variables including the age and calculated VBD. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. R values from 0 to 0.25 were regarded <b>as</b> <b>indicating</b> {{the absence of a}} correlation. Those from 0.25 to 0.50 were regarded <b>as</b> <b>indicating</b> a poor correlation. Those from 0.50 to 0.75 were regarded <b>as</b> <b>indicating</b> a moderate to good correlation. Finally, R values from 0.75 to 1.0 were regarded <b>as</b> <b>indicating</b> a very good to excellent correlation between the variables (Dawson and Trapp 2004).|$|R
30|$|According to the {{comparison}} results, 1.15 is {{selected as the}} threshold value measuring the degree of development of high-angle fracture. Anisotropy strength values between 1 and 1.15 are considered <b>as</b> <b>indicating</b> moderate development of high-angle fractures; while anisotropy strength values greater than 1.15 are considered <b>as</b> <b>indicating</b> over-development of high-angle fractures.|$|R

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>indicated,</b> hospice is {{frequently}} under-utilized and often not {{taken advantage of}} until very late in a patient's illness.

5|$|In Belgium, {{the growth}} of the {{religion}} quickly begin to slow down, even to decline, <b>as</b> <b>indicated</b> by the fact that no temple has been built since 1968 and that several of them are currently unused {{because of a lack of}} dressed members and/or money.

5|$|Menkauhor ruled for {{possibly}} {{eight or}} nine years, following king Nyuserre Ini, and was succeeded in turn by Djedkare Isesi. Although Menkauhor is well attested by historical sources, few artifacts from his reign have survived. Consequently, his familial relation to his predecessor and successor is unclear, and no offspring of his have been identified. Khentkaus III may have been Menkauhor's mother, <b>as</b> <b>indicated</b> by evidence discovered in her tomb in 2015.|$|E

5|$|A {{disturbance}} {{associated with}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) left the coast of West Africa on August 9, producing mid-level winds of 75mph (120km/h) in Dakar, Senegal. A weak circulation formed near the sea surface on August10 within an area of thunderstorms. The disturbance moved slowly westward over the Atlantic Ocean, developing into a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on August12, around the 10th parallel north, an unusually southern latitude the cyclone would remain around throughout its lifetime. On August13, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alma about 375mi (605km) east of Trinidad and Tobago, <b>as</b> <b>indicated</b> by a Hurricane Hunters flight reporting winds of 65mph (105km/h). This same flight observed a circular eye with a diameter of , the only report of an eye-like structure from this storm.|$|E
