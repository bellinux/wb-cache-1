In particular these regulations set the emission standards and the related implementing measures, divided into three different steps, that will enter into force between 2009 (Euro 5) and 2014 (Euro 6).

An onboard instrumentation able to communicate with the electronic system <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle</b> (OBD/CAN) was developed to collect all the sensor data installed on a vehicle: those values are used as input values to the emissions models of CO 2, CO, HC and NOx developed in the present work. The CO 2 and CO have been calculated using a chemical equilibrium combustion model with 6 combustion products, with the equilibrium temperature used as a calibration constant. HC and NOx, produced during transients, are assumed to be dependent from the accelerator pedal gradient, but during engine cold start also from the catalyst temperature. To validate the models, a spark ignition hybrid vehicle, the Honda Civic Hybrid has been tested on a chassis dynamometer running the three Artemis driving cycles. The emissions have been measured with the CVS (taken as reference) and with a portable emission analyzer, (Horiba OBS 1300), used for comparison with the models.

From 2014, PN and PM limits are also introduced for the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> gasoline-fuelled <b>vehicles.</b> While conventional Port Fuel Injection (PFI) gasoline vehicles can easily comply with these limits, their Direct Injection (GDI) counterparts are found to emit systematically above this threshold by up to 1. 5 orders of magnitude [1, 2]. The Euro 6 b legislations will tolerate a PN limit at 6. 0 × 1012 particulates/km for these GDI vehicles but this standard will be strengthened from 2017 (Euro 6 c) to reach the level of Diesel cars. It is therefore expected that GDI vehicles may require the installation of Gasoline Particulate Filters (GPF). At the same time, the penetration <b>of</b> GDI <b>vehicles</b> is expected to rapidly grow {{in the near future}} in both the European and the US markets. This is due to their improved fuel efficiency compared to the conventional PFIs as well as their ability to be implemented in hydride cars.

In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic use of engineered murine MSCs for in vivo delivery of the uPA antagonist amino-terminal fragment (hATF) in order to impair osteolytic CaP cells progression in bone and to repair bone lesions. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) revealed that both primary MSCs (pMSCs) and MSC line C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 (C 3) expressing hATF (MSC-hATF) inhibited significantly intra-tibial PC- 3 -Luc growth following co-injection in SCID mice. Furthermore, micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging of vascular network clearly demonstrated a significant decrease of tumor-associated angiogenesis and a protection from tumor-induced osteolysis in MSC-hATF treated mice. Importantly, the osteogenic potential of MSC-hATF cells was unaffected and area of new bone formation was evidenced in 60 % of animals. Altogether, these data support the concept of MSC-based therapy of tumor osteolysis disease, indicating that MSCs may combine properties <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> for angiostatic agent with osteogenic potential. ______________________________________________________________________________ Author contributions: V.

40|$|When {{talking about}} {{innovation}} rail vehicle industry is often regarded as outdatet. Compared with the competitors of automotive and {{air and space}} industries {{there appears to be}} a deficiency of innovation: Due to the long lifetime of rolling stock and rigid regulations concerning the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> rail <b>vehicles,</b> it takes long time for innovations to reach and protrude markets. These long cycles create a strong need for the soonest possible detection of prospective innovations as well as fast and effective ways to realize them. Because of rather small research and development departments within railway industry, innovation cannot be achieved as fast and thorough as it is in automotive. Regarding these problems the present dissertation introduces a method to detect and analyze innovations of other, related industrial sectors to improve the own product. Based on established innovation processes, ways are shown how technologies, which are used in other sectors, can be used as a source of innovation within the railway sector and how synergies can be exploited. Furthermore the different means of innovation are combined to a methodology of migrating technologies. On the basis of an existing rail vehicle this methodology allows to detect relevant technologies in different industrial sectors and to adopt those technologies to rail vehicles in a simple manner. Thus a process of innovation is introduced by this dissertation, which contrarily to other processes does not enforce the development of a new technology but the transfer of known technologies between different sectors of industry. Besides the essential similarities in different means of transportation, there is also a focus on conflicting requirements of rail and road vehicles. To achieve a compliance of railway standards the present process also considers a way of adaptation to rail-specific requirements...|$|R
