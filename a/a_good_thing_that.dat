500|$|On 4 March the Japanese {{mounted a}} retaliatory {{raid on the}} Buna airfield, {{the site of a}} base that the Allies had {{captured}} back in January, though the fighters did little damage. Kenney wrote in his memoir that the Japanese reprisal occurred [...] "after the horse had been stolen from the barn. It was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> the Nip air commander was stupid. Those hundred airplanes would have made our job awfully hard if they had taken part in the big fight over the convoy on March 3rd." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode [...] "The stories in the North and Meereen stayed a bit quiet as all their action got taken care of last week, leaving Cersei's big plot to destroy the Sept and {{everyone}} in it as this finale's big suspenseful and explosive set piece. Elsewhere, there were big reveals and revenge kills that helped everything {{add up to a}} very surprising and satisfying season finale." [...] He continued by praising how the trial sequence played out on screen, writing [...] "The actual staging and pacing of the trial and violent reckoning was really cool, with everyone getting dressed and little puzzle pieces falling into place, little birds leading men to their deaths, and Ramin Djawadi's excellent score." [...] He gave the episode a 9.5 out of 10. Michael Calia of The Wall Street Journal similarly gave praise to the episode, writing [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing...</b> <b>that</b> the season finale was full of massive developments, tying up several plot threads while leaving some others dangling in the most tantalizing way. This was the most complete episode of Game of Thrones yet, and possibly the best." [...] He also wrote, [...] "Dany and her fleet are finally sailing to Westeros, her great dragons casting shadows over the waves. It's on." ...|$|E
500|$|Comparing {{the video}} with works by Stevie Wonder, Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "compared to the {{over-the-top}} sensory overload of 'Countdown, ' the 'Love On Top' clip {{is very simple}} and straightforward, with the singer performing with backup singers and dancers in a spare room. Still, she changes wardrobe with every key change as the song reaches its euphoric climax." [...] Similarly, Leah Collins of Dose magazine wrote, [...] "New jack swing dance moves and costume changes are pretty much {{the focus of this}} one. [...] Still, Beyonce reveals a talent we never knew she had: the ability to switch costumes every time she switches keys. (This, it turns out, is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>That</b> pantsless African dictator look in the first scene? Maybe we're the only ones, but we're not really feeling Idi Amin-chic this season.)" [...] Georgette Cline of The Boombox found similarities between the video for [...] "Love On Top" [...] and the earlier videos that Beyoncé made with Destiny's Child while Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post called the video fancy and an [...] "obvious homage to New Edition's 'If It Isn’t Love.'" [...] A more mixed review was given by Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine who wrote that [...] "The video will do nothing to silence Beyoncé plagiarism or baby bump conspiracy theorists; the first half borrows from an old New Edition video, and the entire thing was clearly filmed before her bump began to show." [...] However, she added, [...] "Still, Vulture salutes any artistic undertaking that requires a costume change with every key change." [...] The video was nominated in the category for Video of the Year at the 2012 BET Awards and in the category for Best Female Video at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards. It won Best Dance Performance at the 2012 Soul Train Music Awards.|$|E

2500|$|The book's release {{party was}} on May 1, 2011, {{the day before}} the Canadian federal {{election}} of that year, in which Brown was running as the Libertarian Party of Canada candidate for the Trinity-Spadina riding. [...] The election was called early after a motion of no confidence on March 25 resulted in the dissolution of Parliament. [...] "Initially, I was a bit annoyed by the timing of the election," [...] Brown said, [...] "but it {{might turn out to be}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I’m getting publicity at this time." [...] Brown came fifth in his riding with 454 votes, losing to incumbent Olivia Chow.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Queen's Canadian titles include Defender of the Faith/Défenseur de la Foi, {{neither the}} monarch {{nor any of}} the viceroys have an {{official}} religious role in Canada. Unlike in the United Kingdom, where the term (Fidei defensor, in Latin) signifies the sovereign's position as Supreme Governor of the Church of England and a member and defender of {{the security of the}} Church of Scotland, there have been no established churches in Canada since before its confederation in 1867. Defender of the Faith thus has a more vague meaning in the Canadian title, alluding only to the monarch's belief in a higher power. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent stated on this matter in his 1953 contribution to the debate on the Royal Style and Titles Act in the House of Commons: [...] "The rather more delicate question arose about the retention of the words defender of the faith... In our countries [...] there are no established churches, but in our countries {{there are people who have}} faith in the direction of human affairs by an all-wise Providence; and we felt that it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> the civil authorities would proclaim that their organization is such that it is a defence of the continued beliefs in a supreme power that orders the affairs of mere men, and that there could be no reasonable objection from anyone who believed in the Supreme Being in having the sovereign, the head of the civil authority, described as a believer in and a defender of the faith in a supreme ruler." ...|$|E

40|$|Data {{visualisation}} {{has become}} synonymous with simple infographics in recent years, but for researchers this isn't necessarily <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>That's</b> according to Dr Jonathan Minton from Glasgow University who uses data visualisation, including 3 D printouts of data to visualise complex questions around social issues such as migration, fertility and mortality. In this episode of Methods he explains why and how data visualisation can help social researchers produce fascinating and important evidence for research and policy and makes the case that 'simple' isn't always best.

60|$|Nellie Townshead smiled {{somewhat}} bitterly, for {{the fact}} that she had ridden after straying cattle, and done <b>a</b> <b>good</b> many <b>things</b> <b>that</b> women do not usually undertake upon the ranch, had apparently escaped her father's attention.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right, of course," [...] the Princess said. [...] "You {{will be one}} of {{the richest}} young women in the country. There is nothing to prevent it. It is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> you have me to look after you." ...|$|E

60|$|Agnes {{was rather}} too fond of Marian {{to be exactly}} right here, for it {{was not at all}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> she should be {{encouraged}} in a reserve which led her not always to do as she would be done by.|$|E
