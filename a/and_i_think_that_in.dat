[...] He believed that he may have pushed too hard at the wrong time in the race, [...] "it was just a case of keeping it on the racing line and hoping they'd battle it out behind me. Felipe's car was like a rocket at the end. Big thanks to my new team: to win in our fourth race, with no pre-season testing, is amazing." [...] Nasr spoke about car management and maintaining the pace levels with the leaders and believed he could have won in an alternative situation, [...] "But anyway, it’s still a good result. We came here to score big points and it’s quite good to go back to Europe knowing that we have a good car, a good team. It keeps getting better and better. I’m feeling quite confident." [...] Coletti believed his third-place finish contributed towards [...] "a good weekend" [...] for himself. He stated that entering the European leg of the season as the points leader had gave him additional motivation and hoped to be competing at the front of the field in Barcelona, [...] "We’re still a few points ahead – ten I think.

60|$|New York is a mart {{and not a}} capital, in {{literature}} {{as well as in}} other things, and doubtless he increasingly felt this. I know that there came a time when he no longer thought the West must be exile for a literary man; and his latest visits to its summer schools as a lecturer impressed him with the genuineness of the interest felt there in culture of all kinds. He spoke of this, with a due sense of what was pathetic as well as what was grotesque in some of its manifestations; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> reconciling himself to our popular crudeness {{for the sake of our}} popular earnestness, he completed his naturalization, in the only sense in which our citizenship is worth having.|$|E
6000|$|He assented with earnestness. He believed, he said, {{that the}} amount spent in liquors of various kinds, which do no good, but much injury, was enough to furnish every laborer's dwelling, not only with comforts, but with elegances. [...] "But then," [...] he said, [...] "one thing is to be considered: a reform of the {{dwellings}} will do a great deal towards promoting a temperance reformation. A man {{who lives in a}} close, unwholesome dwelling, deprived of the natural stimulus of fresh air and pure water, comes into a morbid and unhealthy state; he craves stimulants to support the sinking of his vital powers, caused by these unhealthy influences." [...] There is certainly a great deal of truth in this; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> America, we should add to the force of our Maine law by adopting some of the restrictions of the Lodging House act.|$|E
6000|$|So {{much as to}} {{the object}} {{to be gained by}} the money spent on the war! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> {{estimating}} the nature of the financial position which the war has produced it was necessary that we should consider the value of the object which has been in dispute. The object, I maintain, has been good. Then comes the question whether or no the bill will be fairly paid--whether they who have spent the money will set about that disagreeable task of settling the account with a true purpose and an honest energy. And this question splits itself into two parts. Will the Americans honestly wish to pay the bill; and if they do so wish, will they have the power to pay it? Again that last question must be once more divided. Will they have the power to pay, as regards the actual possession of the means, and if possessing them, will they have the power of access to those means? ...|$|E

60|$|They went up {{the path}} by the brook, from bridge to bridge, till they found {{themselves}} out upon the open mountain at the top. Phineas had resolved {{that he would not}} speak out his mind till he found himself on that spot; that then he would ask her to sit down, and that while she was so seated he would tell her everything. At the present moment he had on his head a Scotch cap with a grouse's feather in it, and he was dressed in a velvet shooting-jacket and dark knickerbockers; and was certainly, in this costume, as handsome a man as any woman would wish to see. And there was, too, a look of breeding about him which had come to him, no doubt, from the royal Finns of old, which ever served him in great stead. He was, indeed, only Phineas Finn, and was known by the world to be no more; but he looked as though he might have been anybody,--a royal Finn himself. And then he had that special grace of appearing to be altogether unconscious of his own personal advantages. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> truth he was barely conscious of them; that he depended on them very little, if at all; that there was nothing of personal vanity in his composition. He had never indulged in any hope that Lady Laura would accept him because he was a handsome man.|$|E
60|$|There ought {{certainly}} {{to be some}} bound beyond which the cult of favorite authors should not be suffered to go. I should keep well within the limit of that early excess now, and should not liken the creation of Shakespeare {{to the creation of}} any heavenly body bigger, say, than one of the nameless asteroids that revolve between Mars and Jupiter. Even this I do not feel to be a true means of comparison, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the case of all great men we like to let our wonder mount and mount, till it leaves the truth behind, and honesty is pretty much cast out as ballast. A wise criticism will no more magnify Shakespeare because he is already great than it will magnify any less man. But we are loaded down with the responsibility of finding him all we have been told he is, and we must do this or suspect ourselves of a want of taste, a want of sensibility. At the same time, we may really be honester than those who have led us to expect this or that of him, and more truly his friends. I wish the time might come when we could read Shakespeare, and Dante, and Homer, as sincerely and as fairly as we read any new book by the least known of our contemporaries. The course of criticism is towards this, but when I began to read Shakespeare I should not have ventured to think that he was not at every moment great. I should no more have thought of questioning the poetry of any passage in him than of questioning the proofs of holy writ. All the same, I knew very well that much which I read was really poor stuff, and the persons and positions were often preposterous. It is a great pity that the ardent youth should not be permitted and even encouraged to say this to himself, instead of falling slavishly before a great author and accepting him at all points as infallible. Shakespeare is fine enough and great enough when all the possible detractions are made, and I have no fear of saying now that he would be finer and greater for the loss of half his work, though if I had heard any one say such a thing then I should have held him as little better than one of the wicked.|$|E

All of our music has always been written entirely by us, without any influence, so to have him step in and help us with the direction is tremendous.
