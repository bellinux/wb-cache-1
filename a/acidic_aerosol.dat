In early May 2005, a catastrophic release of acidic {{water from the}} lake, with an {{accompanying}} <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol</b> component, drained and flooded Indecision and Volcano Creeks with acidic water, traveled 27 km downstream and flowed into the Mother Goose Lake, headwaters of the King Salmon River. Extensive vegetation damage occurred along the flood route and Mother Goose Lake was acidified (pH of 2.9-3.1), killing all aquatic life and preventing the annual salmon run. The lake now drains from the summit through an outlet cave into Indecision Creek. Indecision Creek now usually has a strong sulphur odor, yellow color and a pH of 1.2.|$|E
40|$|Several past {{studies of}} the {{historical}} London air pollution record have reported an association between daily mortality and British Smoke levels. However, this pollution index does not give direct information on particulate mass or its chemical composition. A more specific particulate matter index, aerosol acidity, was measured at a site in central London, and daily data are available for the period 1963 - 1972. British Smoke and SO 2 were also measured at the same site. Also, meteorological parameters were routinely measured at a nearby British Meteorological Office. Thus, daily fluctuation of the acidic aerosols was characterized in terms of other environmental parameters. Each of the other parameters analyzed seems necessary, but not sufficient to explain {{a high level of}} <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol.</b> Overall, about half of the variance of log-transformed daily fluctuations of acidic aerosols can be explained by a combination of parameters including SO 2 and British Smoke concentrations, temperature, ventilation by wind, and humidity. The rest of the variance cannot be explained by the parameters included in this analysis. Potential factors responsible for this unique variance would be variations in the availability of basic gases to cause neutralization and variation in the availability of catalytic metal salts. Because the <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol</b> has a unique component of variation, {{it may be possible to}} distinguish health effects due to this specific pollutant from other available pollution indices or environmental factors...|$|E

The majority of date was not derived from studies necessarily designed to examine human exposures. Most of the studies were designed to investigate the characteristics of {{the atmosphere}}. However, the measurements were useful in defining two potential exposure situations: regional stagnation and transport conditions and local plume impacts. 3 Levels of <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol</b> in excess of 20 to 40 Ag/im (as H 2 SO 4) have been observed for time durations ranging from 1 to 12 hr. These were associated with high, but not necessarily the highest, atmospheric SO 4 - levels. Exposures of 100 to 900 Mg/Mm 3 /hr were calculated for the acid events that were monitored. In contrast, earlier London studies indicated that apparent acidity in excess of 100 Jg/mi 3 (as H 2 SO 4) was present {{in the atmosphere}}, and exposures < 2000 lAg/m 3 /hr were possible. Our present knowledge about the frequency, magnitude, and duration of acidic sulfate aerosol events and episodes is insufficient. Efforts must be made to gather more data, but these should be done {{in such a way that}} evaluation of human exposure is the focus of the research.

40|$|While {{it is well}} {{established}} that organics compose a large fraction of the atmospheric aerosol mass, the mechanisms through which organics are incorporated into atmospheric aerosols are not well understood. Acid-catalyzed reactions of compounds with carbonyl groups have recently been suggested as important pathways for transfer of volatile organics into <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosols.</b> In the present study, we use the aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) to probe the uptake of gasphase hexanal into ammonium sulfate and sulfuric acid aerosols. While both deliquesced and dry non-acidic ammonium sulfate aerosols showed no organic uptake, the <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosols</b> took up substantial amounts of organic material when exposed to hexanal vapor. Further, we used 1 H-NMR, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and GC–MS to identify {{the products of the}} acid-catalyzed reaction of hexanal in <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosols.</b> Both aldol condensation and hemiacetal products were identified, with the dominant reaction products dependent upon the initial acid concentration of the aerosol. The aldol condensation product was formed only at initial concentrations of 75 – 96 wt % sulfuric acid in water. The hemiacetal was produced at all sulfuric acid concentrations studied, 30 – 96 wt % sulfuric acid in water. Aerosols up to 88. 4 wt % organic/ 11. 1 wt % H 2 SO 4 / 0. 5 wt % water were produced via these two dimerization reaction pathways. The UV-VIS spectrum of the isolated aldol condensation product, 2 -butyl 2 -octenal, extends into the visible region, suggesting these reactions may impact aerosol optical properties as well as aerosol composition.

In the present study, strong and aerosol acidity properties of PM 2. 5 were evaluated based on the highly time-resolved measurements of PM 2. 5 ionic compositions obtained at the highest mountain site in central eastern China in spring and summer of 2007. Overall, PM 2. 5 was weakly acidic at Mt. Tai with 57. 2 % and 81. 3 % of the observations being <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosols</b> in spring and summer, respectively. Strong and aerosol acidities showed higher levels in summer (mean±stand deviation: 142. 65 ± 115. 23 and 35. 27 ± 30. 88 nmolm - 3) and lower concentrations in spring (64. 82 ± 75. 07 and 25. 25 ± 32. 23 nmolm - 3). Aerosol pH exhibited an opposite seasonal trend with less <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosols</b> in summer compared to the aerosols in spring due to high water content in the particles in summer. Strong acidity showed a well-defined diurnal profile with a broad peak during the daytime, while aerosol acidity was at relatively low level in the daytime. The effects of ambient RH and atmospheric aging on the acidities of PM 2. 5 were examined. Aerosol water content facilitated the release of free H + in the aerosol droplet via hydrolysis processes of bisulphate and <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosols</b> were often associated with more processed air masses. Several cases with formation and accumulation of secondary organic aerosols occurring were investigated. The results indicated that the increase of secondary organic aerosols was probably due to effects of acidity promotion and aqueous phase formation.

The results are, within the uncertainty range of the measurements, comparable to those of net throughfall measurements corrected for canopy exchange, except for the results concerning Na and Cl.

40|$|A {{parameterization}} {{is described}} for low-level clouds that {{are characteristic of}} the Arctic during winter. This parameterization simulates the activation of aerosols, the aggregation/coalescence, and the gravitational deposition of ice crystals/water droplets and the deposition/condensation of water vapor onto ice crystals/water droplets. The microphysics scheme uses four prognostic variables to characterize clouds: ice water content, liquid water content, and the mean diameter for ice crystals and for water droplets, and includes prognostic supersaturation. The parameterization simulates stable clouds where turbulence and entrainment are weak, like ice fogs, thin stratus, and diamond dust. The parameterization is tested into the Local Climate Model (LCM), which is the single column version of the Northern Aerosol Regional Climate Model (NARCM). NARCM is a regional model with an explicit representation of the aerosol physics and with the physics package of the Canadian Climate Center General Circulation Model version two. Since most climate models do not have prognostic size-segregated aerosol representation, an alternate method is proposed to implement the microphysical parameterization into these models. The model results are compared to observations of diamond dust and ice fog at Alert (Canada) for the period 1991 – 94. Two aerosol scenarios are compared in the simulation: a natural background aerosol scenario and an <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol</b> scenario. Results show that the LCM reproduces approximately the time variation of the observed weekly frequency of the total ice crystal precipitation with a correlation coefficient of 0. 4. Although it overestimates diamond dust frequency and underestimates ice fog frequency, the LCM predicts quite well the total precipitation frequency (ice fog and diamond dust added). The <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol</b> scenario is in good agreement with the observations, showing a mean frequency of total precipitation over the 4 yr of 39 % compared to the observed value of 37 %. The natural aerosol scenario overestimates this frequency with a value of 47 %. These results were expected since recent aerosol observations have shown the predominance of sulfuric acid–coated aerosols in the Arctic during winter...|$|E
40|$|S Supporting In{{formation}} ABSTRACT: Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from 2 -methyl- 3 -buten- 2 -ol (MBO) photooxidation {{has recently}} been observed in both field and laboratory studies. Similar {{to the level of}} isoprene, the level of MBO-derived SOA increases with elevated aerosol acidity in the absence of nitric oxide; therefore, an epoxide intermediate, (3, 3 -dimethyloxiran- 2 -yl) methanol (MBO epoxide), was synthesized and tentatively proposed to explain this enhance-ment. In this study, the potential of the synthetic MBO epoxide to form SOA via reactive uptake was systematically examined. SOA was observed only in the presence of <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol.</b> Major SOA constituents, 2, 3 -dihydroxyisopentanol and MBO-derived organosulfate isomers, were chemically characterized in both laboratory-generated SOA and in ambient fine aerosol collected from the BEACHON-RoMBAS field campaign during the summer of 2011, where MBO emissions are substantial. Our results support the idea that epoxides are potential products of MBO photooxidation leading to the formation of atmospheric SOA and suggest that reactive uptake of epoxides may explain acid enhancement of SOA observed from other biogenic hydrocarbons. 1...|$|E

This study investigates whether <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosols</b> and other air pollutants are associated with respiratory symptoms in free-living asthmatics. METHODS: Daily concentrations of hydrogen ion (H+), nitric acid, fine particulates, sulfates and nitrates were obtained during an intensive air monitoring effort in Denver, Colorado, in the winter of 1987 - 88. A panel of 207 asthmatics recorded respiratory symptoms, frequency of medication use, and related information in daily diaries. We used a multiple regression time-series model to analyze which air pollutants, if any, were associated with health outcomes reported by study participants. RESULTS: Airborne H+ was found to be significantly associated with several indicators of asthma status, including moderate or severe cough and shortness of breath. Cough was also associated with fine particulates, and shortness of breath with sulfates. Incorporating the participants' time spent outside and exercise intensity into the daily measure of exposure strengthened the association between these pollutants and asthmatic symptoms. Nitric acid and nitrates were not significantly associated with any respiratory symptom analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: In this population of asthmatics, several outdoor air pollutants, particularly airborne acidity, were associated with daily respiratory symptoms...|$|R

Wintertime air pollution in particular has been associated with increased mortality. Identification of causal constituents of inhalable particulate matter has been elusive, although one candidate has been the acidity of the aerosol. Here we report measurements of <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol</b> species made for approximately 1. 5 years in Erfurt, Germany, and Sokolov, Czech Republic. In both locations, the burning of high-sulfur coal is the primary source of ambient air pollution. Twenty-four-hour average measurements were made for PM 10, [particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter (da) 585 micrograms/m 3) and PM 10 (mean concentration 60 micrograms m 3) concentrations were quite high. However, aerosol SO 4 (2 -) concentrations (mean concentration of approximately 10 micrograms/m 3) were not as great as expected given the high SO 2 concentrations, and acidity was very low (mean concentration of < 1 microgram/m 3, with peak levels of only 7 micrograms/m 3).

40|$|Recent {{laboratory}} {{studies have demonstrated}} that isoprene oxidation products can partition to atmospheric aerosols by reacting with condensed phase sulfuric acid, forming low-volatility organosulfate compounds. We have identified organosulfate compounds in free tropospheric aerosols by single particle mass spectrometry during several airborne field campaigns. One of these organosulfates is identified as the sulfate ester of IEPOX, a second generation oxidation product of isoprene. The patterns of IEPOX sulfate ester in ambient data generally followed the aerosol acidity and NOx dependence established by {{laboratory studies}}. Detection of the IEPOX sulfate ester was most sensitive using reduced ionization laser power, when it was observed in up to 80 % of particles in the tropical free troposphere. Based on laboratory mass calibrations, IEPOX added > 0. 4 % to tropospheric aerosol mass in the remote tropics and up to 20 % in regions downwind of isoprene sources. In the southeastern United States, when <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol</b> was exposed to fresh isoprene emissions, accumulation of IEPOX increased aerosol mass by up to 3 %. The IEPOX sulfate ester is therefore one of the most abundant single organic compounds measured in atmospheric aerosol. Our data show that acidity-dependent IEPOX uptake is a mechanism by which anthropogenic SO 2 and marine dimethyl sulfide emissions generate secondary biogenic aerosol mass throughout the troposphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{speciation}} {{of iodine}} in atmospheric aerosol is currently poorly understood. Models predict negligible iodide concentrations and accumulation of iodate in aerosol, {{both of which}} is not confirmed by recent measurements. We present an updated aqueous phase iodine chemistry scheme for use in atmospheric chemistry models and discuss sensitivity studies with the marine boundary layer model MISTRA. These studies show that iodate can be reduced in <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol</b> by inorganic reactions, i. e., iodate does not necessarily accumulate in particles. Furthermore, the transformation of particulate iodide to volatile iodine species likely has been overestimated in previous model studies due to negligence of collision-induced upper limits for the reaction rates. However, inorganic reaction cycles still {{do not seem to}} be sufficient to reproduce the observed range of iodide &ndash; iodate speciation in atmospheric aerosol. Therefore, we also investigate the effects of the recently suggested reaction of HOI with dissolved organic matter to produce iodide. If this reaction is fast enough to compete with the inorganic mechanism, it would not only directly lead to enhanced iodide concentrations but, indirectly via speed-up of the inorganic iodate reduction cycles, also to a decrease in iodate concentrations. Hence, according to our model studies, organic iodine chemistry, combined with inorganic reaction cycles, is able to reproduce observations. The presented chemistry cycles are highly dependent on pH and thus offer an explanation for the large observed variability of the iodide &ndash; iodate speciation in atmospheric aerosol...|$|E

40|$|Human {{health effects}} have {{resulted}} from the inhalation of ambient acidic aerosols, and there is suggestive evidence that current North American levels of exposure are producing excesses in respiratory morbidity. Annual mean mortality rates have been correlated with ambient aerosol concentration indices, with SO 4 (2 -), FP, IP, and TSP having a descending order as predictive coefficients. These pollutant indices also contain H+ in descending mass ratios, and may all be surrogates for H+ as an active agent. Controlled exposure studies in humans and animals provide evidence that acidic aerosols produce greater changes in respiratory mechanical function and rates of particle clearance than other constituents of ambient particulate matter. The strong acid content of the ambient aerosol has not been measured {{in any of the}} population based pollutant effects studies in which it is a likely causal factor. The absence of direct measurement data on <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol</b> in these studies, and their reliance on surrogate indices such as SO 2 and SO 4 (2 -), precludes firm conclusions about exposure-response relationships. High priority areas for further investigation include systematic investigation of the spatial and temporal distribution of population exposures; extension and refinement of population response studies in relation to acid aerosol exposures; responses of normal healthy and asthmatic human volunteers to mixtures of acidic aerosols and oxidant vapors under controlled conditions of exposure and exercise intensity; and progression of changes in lung epithelia during repetitive daily exposures of experimental animals to acidic aerosols, oxidants, and their mixtures, with concurrent measurements of particle clearance and respiratory function...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method of}} soft {{ionization}} aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS), bipolar near-infrared laser desorption/ionization AMS (BP-NIR-LDI-AMS), {{has been developed}} for the on-line, real-time analysis of organic aerosols. Use of a single NIR laser pulse to desorb/ionize aerosols deposited onto an aluminum probe results in minimal analyte fragmentation to produce exclusively intact pseudomolecular ions at [M–H]^− for acidic organic analytes and [M+H]^+ for basic organic analytes. Incorporation of a bipolar mass spectrometer with the NIR-LDI source enables simultaneous detection of acidic and basic species in organic particles. Limits of detection (total particulate mass sampled) for amino acids common to the organic fraction of atmospheric aerosols ranged from 69. 1 pg for ornithine to 197 pg for serine on the positive channel, and from 17. 0 pg for glycine to 100 pg for ornithine on the negative channel. From studies of the laser energy dependence of the NIR-LDI mechanism, {{it was found that}} [M–H]^− formation for oleic acid proceeds through simultaneous action of two 1064 nm photons, suggesting a surface-assisted process rather than direct photoionization, for which photon energy is insufficient. For <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol</b> species, sensitivity was found to increase as a function of analyte acidity, while for basic species, [M+H]^+ ion signals were detected only {{in the presence of a}} labile proton source, with the intensity of the ion signals scaling with the acidity of the proton source.

The measurements were carried out at ground level with the stations of the local air quality monitoring agency and with two optical remote sensing instruments. The remote sensing setup consisted of a lidar and a sodar whose measurements allowed us to determine the layers of the lower troposphere during a sea-breeze event up to 1400 m height. The experimental results and measurements of industrial SO 2 in the atmosphere are compared to the numerical simulations of the 3 -D atmospheric non-hydrostatic chemistry model Meso-NH-C. The transport and the dispersion of gaseous SO 2 are studied above the neighbouring industrial and urban areas. We show how the evolution and the redistribution of the SO 2 concentrations at ground level are related to the structure and the dynamics of the sea breeze. The gaseous SO 2 is brought back inland as soon as the sea breeze commences, mixed inner the thermal internal boundary layer and transported inland by the gravity current up to the sea-breeze front, where gases and particles are uplifted. The elevation of the polluted air masses by the sea-breeze system favours the nucleation of the emitted compounds due to the increase of the relative humidity in the uplifted layer.

This nitration reaction is expected to occur in <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol</b> particles found in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere as highly soluble methanol and nitric acid diffuse into these aerosols. Gaseous methyl nitrate is released upon formation, suggesting that some fraction of NO(x) may he liberated from nitric acid (methyl nitrate is later photolyzed to NO(x)) before it {{is removed from the}} atmosphere by wet deposition. Thus, this reaction may have important implications for the NO(x) budget. Reactions have been initiated in 45 - 62 wt% H 2 SO 4 solutions at 10. 0 C. Methyl nitrate production rates increased exponentially with acidity within the acidity regime studied. Preliminary calculations suggest that the nitronium ion (NO 2 (+) is the active nitrating agent under these conditions. The reaction order in methanol appears to depend on the water/methanol ratio and varies from first to zeroth order under conditions investigated. The nitration is first order in nitronium at all acidities investigated.

Calculations suggest the nitration is first order in methanol under tropospheric conditions. The infinitesimal percentage of nitric acid in the nitronium ion form in this acidity regime probably makes this reaction insignificant for the upper troposphere; however, this nitration may become significant in the mid stratosphere where colder temperatures increase nitric acid solubility and higher sulfuric acid content shifts nitric acid speciation toward the nitronium ion...|$|E

Fast (1 Hz) measurements of ammonia were acquired using a Quantum Cascade Laser Tunable Infrared Differential Absorption Spectrometer (QC-TILDAS) at the Harrow supersite. Measurements of PM 2. 5 ammonium, sulfate and nitrate were made using an Ambient Ion Monitor Ion Chromatograph (AIM-IC) with hourly time resolution. The median mixing ratio of ammonia was 2. 5 ppb, with occasional high spikes at night resulting from local emissions. Measurements were used to assess major local emissions of NH 3, diurnal profiles and gas-particle partitioning.

While the fraction of total ammonia (NH x ≡NH 3 + NH 4 +) observed in the gas phase peaks between 0. 1 and 0. 8, AURAMS tended to predict fractions of either less than 0. 05 or greater than 0. 8. The model frequently predicted <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol,</b> in contrast with observations wherein NH x almost always exceeded the observed equivalents of sulfate.

Critical areas for further research include better definition of the critical temporal parameters affecting exposure and response, effects of mixed pollutant exposures, and pathogenetic mechanisms for acid aerosol-induced chronic lung damage...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{evidence}} {{has suggested that}} heterogeneous chemistry of oxygenated hydrocarbons, primarily carbonyls, {{plays a role in}} the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA); however, evidence is emerging that direct uptake of alkenes on <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosols</b> does occur and can contribute to SOA formation. In the present study, significant uptake of monoterpenes, oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes to <b>acidic</b> sulfate <b>aerosols</b> is found under various conditions in a reaction chamber. Proton transfer mass spectrometry is used to quantify the organic gases, while an aerosol mass spectrometer is used to quantify the organic mass uptake and obtain structural information for heterogeneous products. Aerosol mass spectra are consistent with several mechanisms including acid catalyzed olefin hydration, cationic polymerization and organic ester formation, while measurable decreases in the sulfate mass on a per particle basis suggest that the formation of organosulfate compounds is also likely. A portion of the heterogeneous reactions appears to be reversible, consistent with reversible olefin hydration reactions. A slow increase in the organic mass after a fast initial uptake is attributed to irreversible reactions, consistent with polymerization and organosulfate formation. Uptake coefficients (?) were estimated for a fast initial uptake governed by the mass accommodation coefficient (?) and ranged from 1 × 10 - 6 ? 2. 5 × 10 ? 2. Uptake coefficients for a subsequent slower reactive uptake ranged from 1 × 10 - 7 ? 1 × 10 - 4. These processes are estimated to potentially produce greater than 2. 5 ?g m ? 3 of SOA from the various biogenic hydrocarbons under atmospheric conditions, which can be highly significant given the large array of atmospheric olefins...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>acidic</b> seed <b>aerosols</b> on the {{formation}} of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) have been examined {{in a number of}} previous studies, several of which have observed strong linear correlations between the aerosol acidity (measured as nmol H + m − 3 air sample volume) and the percent change in secondary organic carbon (SOC). The measurements have used several precursor compounds representative of different classes of biogenic hydrocarbons including isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. To date, isoprene has displayed the most pronounced increase in SOC, although few measurements have been conducted with anthropogenic hydrocarbons. In the present study, we examine several aspects of the effect of aerosol acidity on the secondary organic carbon formation from the photooxidation of 1, 3 -butadiene, and extend the previous analysis of isoprene. The photooxidation products measured in the absence and presence of <b>acidic</b> sulfate <b>aerosols</b> were generated either through photochemical oxidation of SO 2 or by nebulizing mixtures of ammonium sulfate and sulfuric acid into a 14. 5 m 3 smog chamber system. The results showed that, like isoprene and β-caryophyllene, 1, 3 -butadiene SOC yields linearly correlate with increasing <b>acidic</b> sulfate <b>aerosol.</b> The observed acid sensitivity of 0. 11 % SOC increase per nmol m − 3 increase in H + was approximately a factor of 3 less than that measured for isoprene. The results also showed that the aerosol yield decreased with increasing humidity for both isoprene and 1, 3 -butadiene, although to different degrees. Increasing the absolute humidity from 2 to 12 g m − 3 reduced the 1, 3 -butadiene yield by 45 % and the isoprene yield by 85 %...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{abundance}} of NH 3 can influence new particle formation rates, aerosol chemical and optical properties, {{as well as}} N-sensitive ecosystems via deposition. Sources and sinks of gas-phase ammonia (NH 3) are poorly constrained in the High Arctic {{due to a lack}} of field observations. In particular, both the magnitude and direction of sea-air NH 3 exchange are highly uncertain, although previous studies suggest the open ocean is likely to act as a net sink at high latitudes. In order to investigate potential NH 3 sources, sinks and impacts, hourly gas-phase NH 3 and particulate-phase NH 4 + and SO 4 2 - measurements were taken from 13 July to 7 August 2014 aboard a research cruise throughout Baffin Bay and the eastern Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Simultaneous measurements of total seawater ammonium, pH and sea surface temperature were used to compute the compensation point (χ), which is the ambient NH 3 concentration at which sea-air fluxes change direction. Ambient NH 3 ranged from 30 - 650 ng m - 3 throughout the cruise and was several orders of magnitude larger than measured χ values (0. 4 - 10 ng m - 3). Hence, the summertime Arctic Ocean is a strong net sink of NH 3. GEOS-Chem (a chemical transport model) was employed to examine the impact of seabird guano (feces) on surface NH 3 concentrations. A simulation without guano-derived NH 3 emissions yielded highly <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol</b> and underestimated surface NH 3 by several orders of magnitude. Including NH 3 emission estimates from seabird guano greatly improved model-measurement comparison. The importance of seabird guano as an NH 3 source was also investigated using the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model driven by WRF meteorology (FLEXPART-WRF). FLEXPART-WRF results confirm that air masses with origins co-located with large seabird colonies were enriched in NH 3, whereas those originating over the open ocean were depleted in NH 3. The influence of NH 3 from wildfires, as well as implications for N-deposition and aerosol neutralization are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The gas-phase {{oxidation}} of α-pinene {{produces a}} large amount of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the atmosphere. A number of carboxylic acids, organosulfates and nitrooxy organosulfates associated with α-pinene have been found in field samples and some are used as tracers of α-pinene oxidation. α-pinene reacts readily with OH and O 3 in the atmosphere followed by reactions with both HO 2 and NO. Due to the large number of potential reaction pathways, {{it can be difficult to}} determine what conditions lead to SOA. To better understand the SOA yield and chemical composition from low- and high-NO x OH oxidation of α-pinene, studies were conducted in the Caltech atmospheric chamber under controlled chemical conditions. Experiments used low O 3 concentrations to ensure that OH was the main oxidant and low α-pinene concentrations such that the peroxy radical (RO 2) reacted primarily with either HO 2 under low-NO x conditions or NO under high-NO x conditions. SOA yield was suppressed under conditions of high-NO x. SOA yield under high-NO x conditions was greater when ammonium sulfate/sulfuric acid seed particles (highly acidic) were present prior to the onset of growth than when ammonium sulfate seed particles (mildly acidic) were present; this dependence was not observed under low-NO x conditions. When aerosol seed particles were introduced after OH oxidation, allowing for later generation species to be exposed to fresh inorganic seed particles, a number of low-NO x products partitioned to the highly <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol.</b> This indicates that the effect of seed acidity and SOA yield might be under-estimated in traditional experiments where aerosol seed particles are introduced prior to oxidation. We also identify the presence of a number of carboxylic acids that are used as tracer compounds of α-pinene oxidation in the field as well as the formation of organosulfates and nitrooxy organosulfates. A number of the carboxylic acids were observed under all conditions, however, pinic and pinonic acid were only observed under low-NO x conditions. Evidence is provided for particle-phase sulfate esterification of multi-functional alcohols...|$|E
40|$|New parameterizations for the {{formation}} of organic aerosols have been developed. These parameterizations cover SOA formation from biogenic and anthropogenic precursors, NO x dependency, oligomerization and the reactive uptake of pinonaldehyde. Those parameterizations are based on available experimental results. The effects of those parameterizations are tested against various experiments carried out in previous studies inside the outdoor chamber Euphore. Two datasets of experiments were used: the anthropogenic experiments (were SOA is formed mainly from a mixture of toluene, 1, 3, 5 -trimethylbenzene and o-xylene) and the biogenic experiments (were SOA is formed mainly from α -pinene and limonene). SOA formation inside the chamber is simulated by using the Secondary Organic Aerosol Processor (SOAP) model {{to take into account the}} dynamic evolution of concentrations. When assuming no wall deposition of organic vapors, satisfactory results were obtained for the biogenic experiments and most of the anthropogenic experiments. However, the anthropogenic experiments seem to indicate a complex NO x dependency that could not be reproduced by the model. Oligomerization was found to have a strong effect on SOA composition and could have a strong effect on {{the formation}} of SOA. The uptake of pinonaldehyde (which is a high volatility SVOC) onto <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosol</b> was found to be too slow to occur under atmospheric conditions but less volatile or more reactive aldehydes could react in acidic aerosols indicating that the parameterization of Pun and Seigneur (2007) used in some air quality models may lead to an overestimation of SOA concentrations. However, taking into account wall deposition of organic vapors (with the parameters of Zhang et al. (2014)) leads to a strong underestimation of SOA concentrations. This feature is consistent with the fact that the SOA mechanisms are based on environmental chamber data. This underestimation could however be corrected by decreasing the volatility of SVOC by a factor 3. The effect of particle viscosity was also estimated. Low changes in concentrations were found when taking into account SOA viscosity. Taking it into account leads to a decrease of SVOC evaporation and prevents changes in concentration due to changes of temperature during the experiments...|$|E
25|$|Dilution {{of indoor}} {{pollutants}} with outdoor air is effective {{to the extent}} that outdoor air is free of harmful pollutants. Ozone in outdoor air occurs indoors at reduced concentrations because ozone is highly reactive with many chemicals found indoors. The products of the reactions between ozone and many common indoor pollutants include organic compounds that may be more odorous, irritating, or toxic than those from which they are formed. These products of ozone chemistry include formaldehyde, higher molecular weight aldehydes, <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosols,</b> and fine and ultrafine particles, among others. The higher the outdoor ventilation rate, the higher the indoor ozone concentration and the more likely the reactions will occur, but even at low levels, the reactions will take place. This suggests that ozone should be removed from ventilation air, especially in areas where outdoor ozone levels are frequently high. Recent research has shown that mortality and morbidity increase in the general population during periods of higher outdoor ozone and that the threshold for this effect is around 20 parts per billion (ppb).|$|R
40|$|The {{air quality}} {{network in the}} Netherlands {{is based on a}} regular grid with an interstation {{distance}} of 30 to 40 km. In or close to source areas, a higher station density is realized. Atmospheric transport models form an intrinsic part of the air quality monitoring system. The models are constructed {{in such a way that}} only routinely available meteorological input data are needed. The models are applied for interpretation and generalization of the measurements in terms of contributions of source categories. In scenario studies, the potential effect of abatement strategies is explored. The output of the models consists of concentration and deposition fields of NO., NO 2, SO 2, sulfate, and nitrate on the scale of the Netherlands or on the scale of northwestern Europe. In the present version the models are not directly suitable to estimate exposures to acidic aerosols; however, in combination with limited aerosol measurements, the model predictions can be used to provide information on the spatial and temporal distribution of <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosols</b> as needed for exposure assessment...|$|R
40|$|A large oxygenated organic uptake to {{aerosols}} {{was observed}} when exposing ambient urban air to inorganic acidic and non-acidic sulfate seed aerosol. For non-acidic seed aerosol the uptake {{was attributed to}} the direct condensation of primary vehicle exhaust gases, and was correlated to the initial seed sulfate mass. The uptake of primary oxygenated organic gases to aerosols in this study represents {{a significant amount of}} organic aerosol (OA) when compared to that reported for primary organic aerosol (POA), but is considerably more oxygenated (O : C ~ 0. 3) than traditional POA. Consequently, a fraction of measured ambient oxygenated OA, which correlate with secondary sulfate, may in fact be of a primary, rather than secondary source. These results represent a new source of oxygenated OA on neutral aerosol and imply that the uptake of primary organic gases will occur in the ambient atmosphere, under dilute conditions, and in the presence of pre-existing SO 4 <b>aerosols.</b> Under <b>acidic</b> seed <b>aerosol</b> conditions, oligomer formation was observed with the uptake of organics being enhanced by a factor of three or more compared to neutral aerosols, and in less than 2 min. This resulted in a trajectory in Van Krevelen space towards higher O : C (slope ~ − 1. 5), despite a lack of continual gas-phase oxidation in this closed system. The results demonstrate that high molecular weight species will form on <b>acidic</b> <b>aerosols</b> at the ambient level and mixture of organic gases, but are otherwise unaffected by subsequent aerosol neutralization, and that aerosol acidity will affect the organic O : C via aerosol-phase reactions. These new processes under both neutral and acidic conditions can contribute to ambient OA mass and the evolution of ambient aerosol O : C ratios and may be important for properly representing organic aerosol O : C ratios in air quality and climate models...|$|R
