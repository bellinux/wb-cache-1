25|$|David Cass was outspoken about {{academic}} and personal freedom. In 1994 he {{became involved in}} an <b>administrative</b> <b>dispute</b> with the University of Pennsylvania over the implications of a consensual faculty-student relationship. At this time he had a consensual relationship with a then-graduate student. When a university policy on faculty-student relationships was adopted Cass was denied the appointment as Chair of the graduate program of the Department of Economics because of this relationship. As the graduate student in question graduated before the planned appointment of Cass as Chair of the department, the timeline of the administrative action rendered the initial objection moot.|$|E
500|$|Johnson was {{involved}} in another <b>administrative</b> <b>dispute</b> during the Australian leg of the campaign. Cec Pepper—whom teammates Miller and Dick Whitington {{regarded as one of}} the best all rounders in the world and a certainty for Australian Test selection—appealed for leg before wicket against Australian captain Don Bradman in the match against South Australia. The appeal was turned down and Pepper complained to the umpire Jack Scott, prompting Bradman—who was also a member of the Australian Board of Control and the board of the South Australian Cricket Association—to ask Scott whether Pepper's behaviour was acceptable. As he was an employee of the SACA, Scott answered to Bradman, and he lodged a complaint about Pepper to the Australian Board of Control. Pepper was [...] never selected for Australia. Cricket historian Gideon Haigh said that [...] "Johnson was clearly upset by the affair, and also by the failure of the [...] selection panel ... to send Pepper, second only to Miller as a cricketer in the Services XI, to New Zealand". Johnson tried to intercede on Pepper's behalf, to no avail, although the other board members claimed that no pressure had been placed on the selectors to exclude Pepper.|$|E

30|$|Based on the {{findings}} of previous studies, this article proposes that the state-business relationship in contemporary China can be categorized into three types: Clientelism, Organizational participation, and Contention. However, existing research does not identify the determinants or conditions that can explain the differentiation among the above three types. This article thus fills this gap by revealing how the economic status of private enterprises influences the differentiation of the state-business relationship in contemporary China. More specifically, the economic status or economic contribution (hereafter referred altogether as “economic capital”) of private enterprises determines their latent or visible bargaining power, which then influences the strategy selection of private enterprises in resolving <b>administrative</b> <b>disputes</b> with the local government. The statistical findings reveal the following pattern. First, facing <b>administrative</b> <b>disputes,</b> private enterprises with higher economic capital are more likely to communicate with the government agencies through formal institutional channels. Second, there is an inverted-U shape relationship between economic capital and the selection of the associational approach or the clientelist approach in resolving <b>administrative</b> <b>disputes.</b> Compared to enterprises with higher or lower economic capital, private enterprises with middle-scale economic capital are more likely to seek help from business associations or particularistic personal relationships with officials.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{regulatory}} agencies and regulated parties in an empirical study of <b>administrative</b> <b>disputes</b> initiated against the decisions of regulatory agencies in Croatia. We first aim to provide an overview of the status and trend estimates regarding these disputes; second, to answer the question how well does the system work from the perspectives of both the plaintiffs and the regulatory agencies; third, to identify the problem areas and to compare these with problem areas identified by the authors studying the broader area of administrative judiciary in Croatia, and finally to compare efficiency level of regulatory agencies to other public authorities in confirming the legality of their decisions and actions. Data on all <b>administrative</b> <b>disputes</b> against 12 Croatian regulatory agencies’ decisions in the 17 -year period between 1995 and 2011 are used to identify the main characteristics and trends relating to these disputes. Data for 2012 to 2013 was also examined to identify initial changes and emerging trends in the new administrative judiciary system resulting from fundamental legal reform as part of Croatia’s process of accession to the European Union in 2013. The results show these <b>administrative</b> <b>disputes</b> to be often costly and timely with modest outcome for the plaintiff and impressive success rate for the most of regulatory agencies...|$|R
