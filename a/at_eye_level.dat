5|$|Due to the {{pressures}} of other projects, Jagger did not begin work on the memorial until the following year, by which time {{he had decided to}} alter the design. The revised memorial would be a third larger than before, cruciform in plan, and guarded by three bronze soldiers. Jagger initially intended to point the howitzer east, towards the Wellington Arch, but after much discussion—including advice from Lutyens and Sir Reginald Blomfield—it was agreed that the howitzer would point south to produce a pleasing silhouette from the park. A lengthy, year-long debate occurred within the RAWCF as to what inscription should be placed on the memorial, adding to the delay. Jagger then decided that the fourth side of the memorial should feature a dead soldier, a proposal which proved controversial. Although recumbent effigies were not uncommon on tombs and (to a lesser extent) war memorials, a sculpture of a dead soldier <b>at</b> <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> was an unusual and dramatic feature among First World War memorials—architects often preferred abstract, classical designs (such as the Cenotaph) or portrayed death through allegory. Jagger was adamant about the inclusion, even offering to pay for the casting of the additional figure himself. After considerable debate, the RAWCF agreed to the modification. Jagger's work continued to take longer than planned, partially due to shortages of staff, the need to approve each amendment to the plan and practical problems on the site itself. The names of his models for three of the statues are known: William Fosten for the Driver, another ex-gunner called Metcalfe for the Ammunition Carrier, and Lieutenant Eugene Paul Bennett, VC, who fought in the same regiment as Jagger.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains were}} found accidentally in an ossuary with the crucified man's name on it, 'Jehohanan, {{the son of}} Hagakol'. Nicu Haas, an {{anthropologist}} at the Hebrew University Medical School in Jerusalem, examined the ossuary and discovered that it contained a heel bone with a nail driven through its side, indicating {{that the man had}} been crucified. The position of the nail relative to the bone indicates that the feet had been nailed to the cross from their side, not from their front; various opinions have been proposed as to whether they were both nailed together {{to the front of the}} cross or one on the left side, one on the right side. The point of the nail had olive wood fragments on it indicating that he was crucified on a cross made of olive wood or on an olive tree. Since olive trees are not very tall, this would suggest that the condemned was crucified <b>at</b> <b>eye</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the characteristics of}} daylight in a scholastic environment was carried out by comparing SPDs and CCTs of the natural source (sky) during typical winter days with contemporaneous measurements of spectral irradiances and CCTs detected <b>at</b> the <b>eyes</b> <b>level.</b> Data obtained from these measurements together with those detected with artificial light, were used to evaluate the effects on melatonin suppression during the day according to the procedure proposed by Rea et al [2]. Despite illuminances on desks under natural and artificial light corresponded to the EN 12464 - 1 Standard requirements, the irradiances detected <b>at</b> <b>eye's</b> <b>level,</b> which are essential for melatonin suppression, do not appear to always guarantee the necessary circadian stimulus. Consequently it can be inferred that much care should be devoted in designing lighting systems in educational environments in order to take into account their effects on the human circadian system synchronization...|$|R

25|$|The frieze is 113 meters long, {{which makes}} it the longest {{surviving}} frieze of Greek Antiquity after the Parthenon frieze. On the western side it is interrupted by the ca. 20 meter wide stairway, which cuts into the foundation on that side and leads to a superstructure with columns. On {{both sides of this}} stairway there are projections constructed and decorated {{in a manner similar to}} the rest of the encircling frieze. The three-wing superstructure is relatively narrow compared with the base. The pillars surrounding the superstructure have platforms with profiles and Ionic capitals. There are many statues on the roof: a quadriga of horses, lion griffins, centaurs and deities, as well as uncompleted gargoyles. The upper hall gives a spacious impression thanks to the widely spaced columns. An additional columned hall was also planned for the inner courtyard where the fire altar itself was located, but not implemented. A frieze was installed there <b>at</b> <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> depicting the life of the mythical founder of the city, Telephus. Although no remains of paint have been found, it can be assumed that the entire structure was brightly painted in antiquity.|$|E
500|$|Lutyens' design, with {{flanking}} objects, recumbent {{figure and}} a Stone of Remembrance set {{in front of}} the cenotaph, is reminiscent of his earlier cenotaph in Southampton. While many First World War memorials feature sculpture or overt religious symbolism, Manchester's, like many of his memorials, uses abstract and ecumenical shapes inspired by classical architecture. Its effigy of the unknown soldier raised high on the pylon rather than <b>at</b> <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> is reminiscent of ancient tower tombs. The sculpture's position high above eye level gives the soldier anonymity, complimenting the abstract shapes of the structures and allowing an onlooker to project an image of their own choosing onto it.|$|E

2500|$|Those from {{cultures}} {{that do not}} carve totem poles often assume that the linear representation of the figures places the most importance on the highest figure, an idea that became pervasive in the dominant culture after it entered into mainstream parlance by the 1930s with the phrase [...] "low man on the totem pole" [...] (and {{as the title of}} a bestselling 1941 humor book by H. Allen Smith). However, Native sources either reject the linear component altogether, or reverse the hierarchy, with the most important representations on the bottom, bearing the weight of all the other figures, or <b>at</b> <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> with the viewer to heighten their significance. Many poles have no vertical arrangement at all, consisting of a lone figure atop an undecorated column.|$|E
2500|$|The {{indigenous}} knowledge Pizarras has {{learned about the}} Philippine tarsier that he shares with the visitors at the Philippine Tarsier Research and Development Center are that it is useless and doubly cruel to keep the animal as a pet because {{it is capable of}} [...] "committing suicide" [...] in captivity. Just to get out, it will bang its head on the cage until it dies. Pizarras said that he has witnessed this many times. If you frequently hold it in your hands, it will be under such stress that it will grow stiff and eventually stop breathing. Thus, touching the [...] "sensitive" [...] tarsier is a no-no in the sanctuary.

2500|$|Boat {{designs are}} used for {{departure}} or arrival wishes, adapted by Banmi Shofu Ryu from classic Ikenobo principles, and uses a boat-shaped container that may sit on a table or hang from a hook. The wish message {{is determined by the}} direction of the “oar” (nagashi) or a long sweeping material or branch. An oar that sweeps {{to the right of the}} viewer means a departing boat (De-Fune), and therefore a farewell or bon voyage wish. The opposite sweep direction indicates a welcome or a wish for a safe return (Iri-Fune). [...] Placement of floral and line materials follow the same rules for shin, soe and uke branches. Note that whether or not the boat is hanging or sitting on a surface, the arrangement should be <b>at</b> <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> so that the water cannot be seen.

2500|$|Many leading Italian {{artists in}} other genre, also {{produced}} some still-life paintings. In particular, Caravaggio applied his influential form of naturalism to still life. His Basket of Fruit (c. 1595–1600) {{is one of}} the first examples of pure still life, precisely rendered and set <b>at</b> <b>eye</b> <b>level.</b> Though not overtly symbolic, this painting was owned by Cardinal Federico Borromeo and may have been appreciated for both religious and aesthetic reasons. Jan Bruegel painted his Large Milan Bouquet (1606) for the cardinal, as well, claiming that he painted it 'fatta tutti del natturel' (made all from nature) and he charged extra for the extra effort. These were among many still-life paintings in the cardinal’s collection, in addition to his large collection of curios. Among other Italian still life, Bernardo Strozzi’s The Cook is a [...] "kitchen scene" [...] in the Dutch manner, which is both a detailed portrait of a cook and the game birds she is preparing.
