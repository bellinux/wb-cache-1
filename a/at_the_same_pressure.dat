Under these assumptions, the power density for p–11B is about 2,100 times smaller than that for D-T. Using cold electrons lowers the ratio to about 700. These numbers are another indication that aneutronic fusion power is not possible with mainline confinement concepts.|$|E
25|$|The total uptake and {{delivery}} amount in COF-102 and COF-103 outperform other 2D and 3D-COFs at high pressure, even the benchmark MOF-177. In October 2011, new COFs with better delivery amount {{have been shown}} to be stable and overcome the DOE target in delivery basis. COF-103-Eth-trans and COF-102-Ant, are found to exceed the DOE target of 180 v(STP)/v at 35 bar for methane storage. Thus at 35 bar (in v(STP)/v delivery units) the best performers is COF-103-Eth-trans which stores 5.6 times as much as bulk CH4 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>pressure</b> (bulk CH4 reaches 34). All the designed COFs have superior performance to previously reported COFs and MOFs, such as COF-102 (137), MOF-177 (112), and MOF-200 (81 v(STP)/v delivery units). The new materials were designed for best performance at 35 bar. They reported that using thin vinyl bridging groups aid performance by minimizing the interaction methane-COF at low pressure. This can be extended to MOFs. This is a new feature that can be used to enhance loading in addition to the common practice of adding extra fused benzene rings.|$|E

Considering the point established, that in all these gases induction takes place by an action of contiguous particles, this is the more important, and adds one to the many striking relations which hold between bodies having the gaseous condition and form. Another equally important electrical relation, which will be examined in the next paper[A], is that which the different gases have to each other <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>pressure</b> of causing the retention of the same or different degrees of charge upon conductors in them.
