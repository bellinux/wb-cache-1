According to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources, Narses, out of spite for having been removed by Justinian's successor Justin II, called the Lombards to Italy. Often dismissed as an unreliable tradition, it has been studied with <b>attention</b> <b>by</b> modern scholars, in particular Neil Christie, who see in it a possible record of a formal invitation by the Byzantine state to settle in northern Italy as foederati, to help protect the region against the Franks, an arrangement that may have been disowned by Justin II after Narses' removal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We present three {{mechanisms}} of attention shift for autonomous agents {{within the framework}} of the SALT model of memory [5]: activation-based attention shift, <b>attention</b> shift <b>by</b> event-driven emotion and <b>attention</b> shift <b>by</b> anticipation-driven emotion. The three mechanisms rely on automatically computed properties of memory (as opposed to deliberative processes). Activation-based attention shift is based on the activation of cognitive structures stored in long term memory. The other two are two-step emotion-based {{mechanisms of}} attention shift: first emotion interrupts the agent's current cognitive process (as in activation-based attention shift), then the processing of the emotion directs the agent's attention to the external environment. In <b>attention</b> shift <b>by</b> event-driven emotion, the ongoing cognitive process may be interrupted when an external event causes the agent to experience an emotion. In the <b>attention</b> shift <b>by</b> anticipation-driven emotion, the ongoing cognitive process may be interrupted when the agent anticipates affective states attributed to the external environment...|$|R

Burgoyne's forces were thrown back to the positions that they held before the September 19 battle and the Americans captured a portion of the entrenched British defenses.|$|E

Twenty-one people were killed, mostly Canadian troops bound for Korea. Diefenbaker paid $1,500 and sat a token bar examination to join the Law Society of British Columbia to take the case, and gained an acquittal, prejudicing the jury against the Crown prosecutor and pointing out a previous case in which interference had caused information to be lost in transmission.|$|E
5|$|Feral {{cats are}} {{domestic}} cats that {{were born in}} or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas. The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the US feral population range from 25 to 60million. Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food.

Such treatment may include exercises, but which are different from those associated with the Bates method, and parents who subscribe to Bates' ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late.

5|$|Apollo 8 {{was planned}} to be the D mission in December 1968, crewed by McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart, {{launched}} on a Saturn V instead of two Saturn IBs. In the summer it had become clear that the LM would not be ready in time. Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth-orbiting mission, ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon instead, deferring the D mission to the next mission in March 1969, and eliminating the E mission. This would keep the program on track. The Soviet Union had sent two tortoises, mealworms, wine flies, and other lifeforms around the Moon on September 15, 1968, aboard Zond 5, and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts. The decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of Apollo 7. Gemini veterans Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, and rookie William Anders captured the world's <b>attention</b> <b>by</b> making ten lunar orbits in 20 hours, transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on Christmas Eve, and returning safely to Earth.|$|E
5|$|At {{one year}} of age, joint {{attention}} is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as an intentional act. One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see. At age 15 months, children recognize the minds of others. At this age, children also {{recognize the importance of}} eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight. At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention. 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the mentalistic experience of seeing and the role of eyes and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision. At two years of age, children display joint <b>attention</b> <b>by</b> extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well. Two-year-olds are also capable of representational thought or increased memory.|$|E

Between then and November, he rarely mentioned Hoover's name publicly, though he said late in the campaign that he would vote for the president. He made speeches discussing issues, not candidates, and did nothing to aid Hoover's doomed campaign against Franklin D. Roosevelt. When some Idahoans demanded that he support Hoover on pain of being opposed for renomination for Senate in 1936, Borah responded that he regretted if his quarter century in the Senate had left them with the impression he might be moved by such an ultimatum.|$|E
