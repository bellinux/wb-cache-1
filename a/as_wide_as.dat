5|$|The Atlantic torpedo has {{a nearly}} {{circular}} pectoral fin disc 1.2 times <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> it is long, {{with a thick}} and nearly straight front margin. The eyes are small and are followed by much larger spiracles, which do not have papillae on their inner rims. The nostrils {{are close to the}} mouth; there is a flap of skin between them three times <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> long, with a sinuous rear margin. The mouth is wide and arched, with prominent furrows at the corners. The teeth are pointed and increase in number with age, ranging from 38 rows in juveniles to 66 rows in adults; the first several series of teeth are functional. The gill slits are small, with the first and fifth pairs shorter than the others.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southern}} {{limits of the}} constellation lie Kappa and Lambda Canis Majoris. Although of similar spectra and nearby each other as viewed from Earth, they are unrelated. Kappa is a Gamma Cassiopeiae variable of spectral type B2Vne, which brightened by 50% between 1963 and 1978, from magnitude 3.96 or so to 3.52. It is around 659 light-years distant. Lambda is a blue-white B-type main sequence dwarf with an apparent magnitude of 4.48 located around 423 light-years from Earth. It is 3.7 times <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> and 5.5 times as massive as the Sun, and shines with 940 times its luminosity.|$|E
5|$|Cowan and Hook {{suggest that}} Lucullus would have {{deployed}} the Romans in a simplex acies, {{that is to}} say a single line, so making the frontage of the army <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> possible as a counter to the cavalry. He took several of his troops downriver, where the river was the easiest to ford, and at one moment, Tigranes believed that this move meant Lucullus was withdrawing from the battlefield.|$|E

5|$|Located at the {{northern}} edge of the constellation and just southwest of Achernar is Alpha Hydri, a white sub-giant star of magnitude 2.9, situated 72 light-years from Earth. Of spectral type F0IV, it is beginning to cool and enlarge as it uses up its supply of hydrogen. It is twice as massive and 3.3 times <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> our sun and 26 times more luminous. A line drawn between Alpha Hydri and Beta Centauri is bisected by the south celestial pole.|$|E
5|$|Midbody {{there are}} 21 dorsal scales rows (rarely 19, 20, 22, or 23). These are {{strongly}} keeled scales, {{except for those}} bordering the ventral scales. These scales seem loosely attached to the skin and lower rows become increasingly wide; those closest to the ventral scales are twice <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> the ones along the midline. The ventral scales number 132-150 in males and 132–158 in females. The anal plate is single. The subcaudals are paired, numbering 32–46 in males and 23–38 in females.|$|E
5|$|Some turbellarians have {{a simple}} pharynx lined with cilia and {{generally}} feed by using cilia to sweep food particles and small prey into their mouths, which are usually {{in the middle of}} their undersides. Most other turbellarians have a pharynx that is eversible (can be extended by being turned inside-out), and the mouths of different species can be anywhere along the underside. The freshwater species Microstomum caudatum can open its mouth almost <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> its body is long, to swallow prey about as large as itself.|$|E

5|$|The {{cephalothorax}} of Z.sexpunctatus is {{bronze to}} black in color. Like all Zygoballus spiders, the cephalothorax is box-like in shape, being widest at the posterior lateral eyes. Numerous white or pale blue scales cover the clypeus ("face") and chelicerae. This covering extends around {{the sides of}} the carapace, ending beyond the posterior median eyes. In males, the labium is two-fifths as long as the maxillae, and <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> it is long. The chelicerae of males are greatly enlarged and obliquely oriented, with each chelicera having a prominent inner tooth and a long, curved fang.|$|E
5|$|The nasal bones end bluntly {{close to}} the hindmost extent of the premaxillary bones. The narrow interorbital region, located between the eyes, converges towards the front and is flanked by low beads. The interparietal bone, located in {{the roof of the}} skull on the braincase, is nearly <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> the frontals, but does not reach the squamosals.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{contains elements}} typical of Cimabue's representations of Christ, including the illusionism of the drapery folds, the large halo, long flowing hair, dark, angular faces and dramatic expressions. But {{in other respects}} it conforms to the then strict iconography of the thirteenth century. Typical of depictions of the crucified Christ of this era, with his outstretched arms he is <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> he is long, conforming to prevalent ideals of proportions.|$|E

5|$|Mathilde is very dark, with an albedo {{comparable}} to fresh asphalt, and {{is thought to}} share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid {{has a number of}} extremely large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3km) and Karoo (33.4km), are <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> the asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. No differences in brightness or colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction.|$|E
5|$|On {{the bottom}} of the skull, the pterygoid is about twice <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> it is long. At the front of the pterygoid is a small {{projection}} that extends backwards to form a ridge, on either side of which is a furrow-like depression (the choanal groove) containing the choanae. In Theriosuchus, unlike Knoetschkesuchus, the choanae are embedded in a wider bowl-like depression. Additionally, in both species, the bottom surface of the pterygoid is somewhat concave. Extending forward from either side of the pterygoid is the ectopterygoid; in both species, this bone is constricted near the middle to form an hourglass-like shape, but in K. langenbergensis it is also somewhat twisted to the side. The back of the bone is very concave in both species.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park {{is home to}} one of {{the last}} stands of old-growth forest in eastern North Carolina. A forest of bay trees, sweetgum, pawpaw, persimmon, bald cypress and poplar are found on the {{northern}} shore of Lake Phelps. The cypress have a trunk diameter of up to tenfeet (3m) and the poplar have a trunk diameter of sixfeet (2m). There are vines that are <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> an average man's leg and grow up the trees in excess of 130feet (40m). In the section of the park along the Scuppernong River, the Atlantic white cedar and other rare cedar trees have grown to rather large sizes. Several of the trees at Pettigrew State Park are listed on the North Carolina and National Registries of Big Trees.|$|E

50|$|The other subspecies, A. sandwicense subsp. macrocephalum, {{is found}} in and around Haleakalā crater. They differ {{primarily}} in the inflorescence shapebroader in the Haleakalā plants (less than 4 times <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>wide),</b> and narrower on Mauna Kea (4.3-8.6 times <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>wide).</b> The Haleakalā subspecies also generally has more ray florets, 11-42 versus 5-20 for Mauna Kea.|$|R
5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory and the Army Air Forces {{had already}} {{commenced}} work on improving the design. The North American B-45 Tornado, Convair XB-46, Martin XB-48, and Boeing B-47 Stratojet bombers, {{then on the}} drawing boards, had bomb bays sized to carry the Grand Slam, which was much longer but not <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> the Fat Man. The only American bombers that could carry the Fat Man were the B-29 and the Convair B-36. In November 1945, the Army Air Forces asked Los Alamos for 200 Fat Man bombs. At the time {{there were only two}} sets of plutonium cores and high-explosive assemblies. The Army Air Forces wanted improvements to the design {{to make it easier to}} manufacture, assemble, handle, transport, and stockpile. The wartime Project W-47 was continued, and drop tests resumed in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray has a soft, flabby body devoid of dermal denticles. It has an oval pectoral fin disc about 1.2 times <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> long, with a nearly straight front margin {{and a pair}} of kidney-shaped electric organs visible beneath the skin. The eyes are small and followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles; the space from the spiracles to the snout tip is about 1.8 times the distance between the spiracles. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils that almost reaches the mouth, which is arched with deep furrows at the corners. The distance between the mouth and the snout tip is about equal to the mouth width, and three times that of the distance between the nostrils. There are 25–28 upper tooth rows and 19–26 lower tooth rows; each tooth is tiny and smooth, with a single sharp cusp.|$|E
5|$|The first Alfa-Romeo engined Brabham, the Brabham BT45 was an {{overweight}} and bulky car, initially weighing 625kg and <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> was permitted under the F1 technical regulations. This {{was due to}} the difficulties of packaging the large, powerful Alfa flat-12 engine and the fuel it required to complete a race distance. After lengthy development, it became competitive, but never won a race. In mid-1977, Brabham designer Gordon Murray started work on the ambitious design of the BT46. It was intended to compensate for the weight of the engine and fuel and allow the Brabham team to take a large technical step forward as well as to improve safety.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} between a complex gallery grave and a passage grave (which also has smaller burial chambers opening off the main passage) is two-fold. First, the gallery grave gallery will be <b>as</b> high and <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> the side burial chambers, while in a passage grave the passage is not <b>as</b> high or <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> the burial chambers. Second, gallery graves are usually topped by a V-shaped tumulus, while passage graves are almost always covered by a round tumulus.|$|R
50|$|The other subspecies, Argyroxiphium sandwicense subsp. sandwicense (Mauna Kea silversword), {{is found}} on Mauna Kea. They differ {{primarily}} in the inflorescence shapebroader in the Haleakalā plants (less than 4 times <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>wide),</b> and narrower on Mauna Kea (4.3-8.6 times <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>wide).</b> The Haleakala subspecies also generally has more ray florets, 11-42 versus 5-20 for Mauna Kea.|$|R

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the bluespotted ribbontail ray is oval in shape, around four-fifths <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> long, with a rounded to broadly angular snout. The large, protruding eyes are immediately {{followed by the}} broad spiracles. There is a narrow flap of skin between the nares with a fringed posterior margin, reaching past the mouth. The lower jaw dips at the middle and deep furrows are present at the mouth corners. There are 15–24 tooth rows in either jaw, arranged into pavement-like plates, and two large papillae {{on the floor of}} the mouth. The pelvic fins are narrow and angular. The thick, depressed tail measures about 1.5 times the disc length and bears one or two (usually two) serrated spines well behind the tail base; there is a deep fin fold on the ventral surface, reaching the tip of the tail, and a low midline ridge on the upper surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the mangrove whipray is very thick and oval in shape, measuring 0.9–1.0 times <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> long. The anterior {{margins of the}} disc are nearly straight and converge at a broad angle on the snout tip. The medium-sized, widely spaced eyes are immediately followed by the spiracles. Between the long, thin nostrils is a short, broad curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin. The lower jaw is bow-shaped, and there are 0–5 papillae across {{the floor of the}} mouth. The teeth are arranged in a quincunx pattern and number 40–50 rows in the upper jaw and 38–50 rows in the lower jaw. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc. The pelvic fins are small and narrow.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the porcupine ray is evenly oval, almost <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> long, and very thick at the center, {{giving it a}} domed appearance. The {{tip of the snout}} is rounded and barely protruding. The small eyes are closely followed by much larger spiracles. Between the narrow nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin; the posterior margin of the curtain is strongly fringed and overhangs the mouth. The mouth bears 3–5 papillae on the floor and prominent furrows at the corners. The area around the mouth, including the curtain, are heavily covered by more papillae. There are around 48 tooth rows in either jaw. The teeth are small and flattened. Five pairs of gill slits are located {{on the underside of the}} disc.|$|E
