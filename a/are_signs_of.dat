5|$|Outer {{space is}} sparsely filled with several dozen types of organic {{molecules}} discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy, blackbody radiation {{left over from}} the big bang and the origin of the universe, and cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles.

Additionally, there <b>are</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft.

25|$|Any sign of low blood sodium (hyponatremia) or {{weakness}} {{should be}} treated {{with the addition of}} hematin, heme arginate, or even tin mesoporphyrin, as these <b>are</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> impending syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) or peripheral nervous system involvement that may be localized or severe, progressing to bulbar paresis and respiratory paralysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} this period has {{traditionally}} been a narrative of decline and fall. However, evidence from Verulamium suggests that urban-type rebuilding, featuring piped water, was continuing late on in the 5th century, if not beyond. At Silchester, there <b>are</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> sub-Roman occupation down to around 500, and at Wroxeter new Roman baths have been identiﬁed as Roman-type.|$|E

Former members of Overwatch decide to reform Overwatch despite the Petras Act, recruiting old friends and gaining new allies in their fight.|$|E

The steroid creams should generally be of mid- to high strength {{and used for}} {{less than two weeks}} at a time as side effects can occur. Antibiotics may be required if there <b>are</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> skin infection. Contact dermatitis is typically treated by avoiding the allergen or irritant. Antihistamines may help with sleep and to decrease nighttime scratching.|$|E

This term implies careful observation of the tumor over time, {{with the intention of}} treatment for a cure if there <b>are</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> cancer progression. Active surveillance is not synonymous with watchful waiting, an older term which implies no treatment or specific program of monitoring, with the assumption that palliative, not curative, treatment would be used if advanced, symptomatic disease develops.|$|E

There <b>are</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> wombat diggings on the hill face but they are rarely seen. The occasional swamp wallaby and eastern grey kangaroo visit the gorge. In warm weather skinks, blue tongue lizards and copperhead snakes can be seen. Other rarely seen species include marbled geckos and white-lipped snakes.|$|E
25|$|Since then {{very little}} has arisen on the {{professional}} baseball front. There <b>are</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> promise in Saskatoon as the Northern League had intentions of placing an expansion franchise in Saskatoon, should a local ownership group arise. In order to gauge interest in baseball, the Northern League {{in conjunction with}} the Saskatoon Yellow Jackets held a showcase game between the Edmonton Cracker-Cats and the Calgary Vipers in May 2007. Fan support impressed the ownership of the Cracker-Cats.

25|$|To prevent {{dehydration}} {{readily available}} fluids, preferably {{with a modest}} amount of sugars and salt such as vegetable broth or salted rice water, may be used. The drinking of additional clean water is also recommended. Once dehydration develops oral rehydration solutions are preferred. As much of these drinks as the person wants can be given, unless there <b>are</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> swelling. If vomiting occurs, fluids can be paused for 5–10 minutes and then restarting more slowly. Vomiting rarely prevents rehydration as fluid are still absorbed and the vomiting rarely last long. A severely malnourished child with {{what appears to be}} dehydration but who has not had diarrhea should be treated as if they have an infection.|$|E

25|$|Critics of MINUSTAH's goal of {{providing}} security {{say that the}} provision of increased police presence is coming with the unfortunate consequence of neglecting the vast socioeconomic problems in the area, the lack of effort in addressing infrastructure improvement, the joblessness and the pervasive poverty. In 2009, with the appointment of former U.S. President Bill Clinton as the UN Special Envoy, there is hope that the international donor community will provide increased aid. MINUSTAH renewed its commitment to Haiti, and $3 billion for projects has been pledged by the international community, much of this for rebuilding after the hurricanes. However, in Cité Soleil, there <b>are</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> a desire for political independence {{that the international community}} would rather ignore.|$|E
25|$|A {{magnetometry}} {{survey of}} {{the interior of the}} hillfort in 2010 revealed over 400 circular anomalies of uncertain purpose (maculae) distributed across the fort, although there were fewer around the south-east. Their size and number, as well as finds from similar features in previous excavations, suggests they may have been storage pits. The survey also discovered curved features that probably indicate the presence of roundhouses. They were grouped close to the ramparts on the north, west, and south sides. There <b>are</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> post-medieval quarrying outside the main entrance to the fort. Outside the hillfort were more curved anomalies, suggesting roundhouses in a settlement beyond the ramparts. It was surrounded by a ditch.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after {{a period}} of heavy rain {{followed}} by strong sun, there <b>are</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> distress on the island: fishing boats do not put out to sea, carts do not go to market, people are ascending to the mountains. Then a storm causes a shipwreck and a survivor seeks refuge in Dan’s hut. As he comes in and out of consciousness, the man tells Dan the story of how he is a priest from Ireland come to help stop the “sweating sickness” which grips the island. Before the priest dies, Dan promises that he will take the priest's place and go to the Bishop's to instruct the people how to halt the sickness.|$|E
