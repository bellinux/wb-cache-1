5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S.

Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E

5|$|Considering mental {{states as}} three-place {{relations}} in this way, representative realism {{makes it possible}} to hold together all of the elements necessary to the solution of this problem.

They can be considered the ideal link between the syntactic notion of mental content and the computational notion of functional architecture. These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation of mental processes.|$|E
