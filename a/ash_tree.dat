5|$|The older houses relied {{mainly on}} heating from open coal fires, {{which led to}} {{problems}} with smog (in 1962, 24 deaths in Leeds were attributed to this), although this problem was partially relieved in the 1950s {{with the introduction of}} the Clean Air Act 1956. Although a slum clearance scheme was under way in the 1930s, it took until after the Second World War, for the scheme to get well under way. In the 1950s, the largest social housing project began with the building of the Seacroft Estate. Seacroft was planned at the time to be a 'Satellite town within the city limits'. The building of new council estates was most prevalent in the city's east end and because of this the city expanded much further East {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century then it did any other direction. The Langbar Gardens Estate (completed 1966) in Swarcliffe lay right on the eastern fringes of the city sprawl until it was demolished in the early 21st century, including the high-profile implosions of Langbar Towers, Langbar Grange and <b>Ash</b> <b>Tree</b> Grange. By the 1960s and 1970s land for social housing was becoming scarcer and the council started looking towards building 'high rise', with such estates as Cottingley sporting prominent tower blocks. By the 1970s less land was available for such developments and the particularly large estates were becoming unpopular, however faced with a need for a larger social housing stock, Leeds City Council built smaller estates such as Holt Park (in partnership with Norman Ashton), replaced the prefabricated 'war houses' in Cottingley with newer prefabs and redeveloped areas such as Beckhill in Meanwood.|$|E

50|$|In North America {{the emerald}} ash borer is an {{invasive}} species, highly destructive to <b>ash</b> <b>trees</b> in its introduced range. The damage of this insect rivals that of Chestnut blight and Dutch Elm Disease. To put its damage in perspective, {{the number of}} chestnuts killed by the Chestnut blight was around 3.5 billion chestnut trees while there are 3.5 billion <b>ash</b> <b>trees</b> in Ohio alone. Dutch Elm Disease killed only 200 million elm trees while EAB threatens 7.5 billion <b>ash</b> <b>trees</b> in the United States. The insect threatens the entire North American genus Fraxinus, while past invasive tree pests have only threatened a single species within a genus. Since its accidental introduction into the United States and Canada in the 1990s, and its subsequent detection in 2002, it has spread to eleven states and adjacent parts of Canada. It has killed at least 50 million <b>ash</b> <b>trees</b> so far and threatens to kill most of the <b>ash</b> <b>trees</b> throughout North America. The green ash and the black <b>ash</b> <b>trees</b> are affected. White ash is also killed rapidly, but usually only after green and black <b>ash</b> <b>trees</b> are eliminated. Blue ash displays some resistance to the emerald ash borer by forming callous tissue around EAB galleries; however, they are usually killed. White ash has been less affected by emerald ash borer due to its small population (unlike its cousin, F. americana is not commonly seen in cultivation) compared to green ash, which was planted in huge numbers as an ornamental.|$|R

25|$|The Old Norse form of Irmin is Jörmunr, {{which just}} like Yggr {{was one of}} the names of Odin. Yggdrasil ("Yggr's horse") was the yew or <b>ash</b> <b>tree</b> from which Odin sacrificed himself, and which {{connected}} the nine worlds. Jakob Grimm connects the name Irmin with Old Norse terms like iörmungrund ("great ground", i.e. the Earth) or iörmungandr ("great snake", i.e. the Midgard serpent).|$|E
25|$|A common shamanic concept, and a universally told story, {{is that of}} {{the healer}} {{traversing}} the axis mundi to bring back knowledge from the other world. It may be seen in the stories from Odin and the World <b>Ash</b> <b>Tree</b> to the Garden of Eden and Jacob's Ladder to Jack and the Beanstalk and Rapunzel. It is the essence of the journey described in The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. The epic poem relates its hero's descent and ascent through a series of spiral structures that take him from through the core of the earth, from the depths of Hell to celestial Paradise.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Ovid, other Roman writers also mentioned lycanthropy. Virgil wrote {{of human beings}} transforming into wolves. Pliny the Elder relates two tales of lycanthropy. Quoting Euanthes, he mentions a man who hung his clothes on an <b>ash</b> <b>tree</b> and swam across an Arcadian lake, transforming him into a wolf. On the condition that he attack no human being for nine years, he {{would be free to}} swim back across the lake to resume human form. Pliny also quotes Agriopas regarding a tale {{of a man who was}} turned into a wolf after tasting the entrails of a human child, but was restored to human form 10 years later.|$|E

Sherburn Court, the remaining high-rise block, was refurbished and given a new roof, windows and lifts.|$|E
25|$|Yggdrasil is attested in the Poetic Edda, {{compiled}} in the 13th century {{from earlier}} traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, {{written in the}} 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, Yggdrasil is an immense <b>ash</b> <b>tree</b> that is center to the cosmos and considered very holy. The gods go to Yggdrasil daily to assemble at their things. The branches of Yggdrasil extend far into the heavens, and the tree is supported by three roots that extend far away into other locations; one to the well Urðarbrunnr in the heavens, one to the spring Hvergelmir, and another to the well Mímisbrunnr. Creatures live within Yggdrasil, including the dragon Níðhöggr, an unnamed eagle, and the stags Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Duraþrór.|$|E
25|$|The Proto-Indo-Europeans {{may have}} {{believed}} {{in some kind}} of world tree. It is also possible that they may have believed that this tree was either guarded by or under constant attack from some kind of dragon or serpent. In Norse mythology, the world <b>ash</b> <b>tree</b> Yggdrasil is tended by the three Norns while the dragon Nidhogg gnaws at its roots. In Greek mythology, the tree of the golden apples in the Garden of the Hesperides is tended by the three Hesperides and guarded by the hundred-headed dragon Ladon. In Indo-Iranian texts, there is a mythical tree dripping with Soma, the immortal drink of the gods and, in later Pahlavi sources, an evil lizard is said to lurk at the bottom of it.|$|E

25|$|As for Die Walküre, {{the first}} act of this opera {{probably}} gave Wagner more trouble than any other act in the entire tetralogy. In his two prose sketches for it Wotan enters Hunding's house in his guise as Der Wanderer ("The Wanderer") and thrusts the sword into the <b>ash</b> <b>tree,</b> which Siegmund then withdraws only minutes later; the fully worked-out prose draft also brings Wotan onto the stage. It was only at a later stage {{in the evolution of}} the text that Wagner banished the Wanderer and his sword to the backstory which Sieglinde narrates to Siegmund. Now the sword is already embedded in the tree as the curtain goes up on Act 1 and Siegmund's withdrawal of it becomes a climactic piece of dramaturgy.|$|E

500|$|Sergio Angelini {{writes about}} A Warning to the Curious: [...] "Of Clark's many adaptations of James's stories, {{this is perhaps}} the most varied in its use of {{landscape}} and the most visually arresting in its attempt to create an otherworldly atmosphere. ... Using long lenses to flatten the scenery and make the ghost indistinct in the background, John McGlashan's fine cinematography brilliantly conveys the ageless, ritualistic determinism of Ager's pursuit and signposts the inevitability of Paxton's demise." [...] Angelini is less appreciative of The <b>Ash</b> <b>Tree,</b> noting that the literal adaptation of the story's ending loses the atmosphere of earlier instalments: [...] "While the creatures are certainly grotesque and threatening, compared with some of the other adaptations of the series, The <b>Ash</b> <b>Tree</b> does lose some power through this lack of ambiguity. The result overall remains satisfyingly unsettling, however, thanks also to Petherbridge's restrained, psychologically acute performance." ...|$|E

500|$|Unfortunately {{for those}} who wanted or were {{required}} to wear green, there were no good vegetal green dyes which resisted washing and sunlight.

Only in the 16th century was a good green dye produced, by first dyeing the cloth blue with woad, and then yellow with Reseda luteola, also known as yellow-weed.|$|E
500|$|Oswald {{soon came}} to be {{regarded}} as a saint. Bede says that the spot where he died {{came to be}} associated with miracles, and people took dirt from the site, which led to a hole being dug as deep as a man's height. Reginald of Durham recounts another miracle, saying that his right arm was taken by a bird (perhaps a raven) to an <b>ash</b> <b>tree,</b> which gave the tree ageless vigor; when the bird dropped the arm onto the ground, a spring emerged from the ground. Both the tree and the spring were, according to Reginald, subsequently associated with healing miracles. Aspects of the legend have been considered to have pagan overtones or influencesthis may represent a fusion of his status as a traditional Germanic warrior-king with Christianity. The name of the site, Oswestry, or [...] "Oswald's Tree", is generally thought to be derived from Oswald's death there and the legends surrounding it. [...] His feast day is 5 August. The cult surrounding him even gained prominence in parts of continental Europe.|$|E
