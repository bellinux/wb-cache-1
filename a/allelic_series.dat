500|$|The {{embryonic}} lethality {{hypothesis was}} originally supported by Pulos and Hutt's 1969 study of Mendelian progeny ratios. Conclusions about Mendelian traits that {{are controlled by}} a single gene {{can be drawn from}} test breedings with large sample sizes. [...] However, traits that are controlled by <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> or multiple loci are not Mendelian characters, and are not subject to Mendelian ratios.|$|E
500|$|The white (W) locus {{was first}} {{recognized}} in mice in 1908. The mutation {{of the same}} name produces a belly spot and interspersed white hairs on the dorsal aspect of the coat in the heterozygote (W/+) and black-eyed white in the homozygote (W/W). While heterozygotes are healthy, homozygous W mice have severe macrocytic anemia and die within days. A mutation which affects multiple systems is [...] "pleiotropic." [...] Following the mapping of the KIT gene to the W locus in 1988, researchers began identifying other mutations as part of an <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> of W. There are over 90 known W alleles, each representing a unique mutation on the KIT gene, which primarily produce white spotting from tiny head spots to fully white coats, macrocytic anemia from mild to lethal, and sterility. Some alleles, such as sash produce white spotting alone, while others affect the health of the animal even in the heterozygous state. Alleles encoding small amounts of white are no more likely to be linked with anemia and sterility than those encoding conspicuous white. Presently, no anecdotal or research evidence has suggested that equine KIT mutations affect health or fertility. A recent study showed that blood parameters in horses with the W1 mutation were normal.|$|E
50|$|The loci of the Dark {{budgerigar}} mutation and the Blue <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> {{are situated}} on the same autosome, so the Dark mutation {{is linked to the}} Blue <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> (see genetic linkage). The cross-over value (COV) or recombination frequency between the Dark and Blue loci is commonly stated to be about 14%, but some experiments have found much smaller values (see Genetics in the Dark budgerigar mutation).|$|E
50|$|Solid black plumage is {{controlled}} by B (black), an autosomal dominant allele in the triple <b>allelic</b> b+ <b>series.</b> It produces an entire plumage black with a bright metallic sheen.|$|R
40|$|Congenital limb malformations {{occur in}} 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 human live births and include both gross {{reduction}} defects and more subtle alterations in the number, length and {{anatomy of the}} digits. The major causes of limb malformations are abnormal genetic programming and intra-uterine disruption to development. The identification of causative gene mutations is important for genetic counselling and also provides insights into the mechanisms controlling limb development. This article illustrates some of the lessons learnt {{from the study of}} human limb malformation, organized into seven categories. These are: (1) identification of novel genes, (2) <b>allelic</b> mutation <b>series,</b> (3) pleiotropy, (4) qualitative or (5) quantitative differences between mouse and human development, (6) physical and teratogenic disruption, and (7) unusual biological phenomena...|$|R
50|$|For each {{of these}} {{housekeeping}} genes, the different sequences are assigned as alleles and the alleles at the loci provide an <b>allelic</b> profile. A <b>series</b> of profiles can then be the identification marker for strain typing. Sequences that differ at even a single nucleotide are assigned as different alleles and no weighting is given {{to take into account}} the number of nucleotide differences between alleles, as we cannot distinguish whether differences at multiple nucleotide sites are a result of multiple point mutations or a single recombinational exchange. The large number of potential alleles at each of the loci provides the ability to distinguish billions of different allelic profiles, and a strain with the most common allele at each locus would only be expected to occur by chance approximately once in 10,000 isolates. Despite MLST providing high discriminatory power, the accumulation of nucleotide changes in housekeeping genes is a relatively slow process and the allelic profile of a bacterial isolate is sufficiently stable over time for the method to be ideal for global epidemiology.|$|R

50|$|Solid black plumage is {{controlled}} by E (extended black), an autosomal incomplete dominant allele in its <b>allelic</b> <b>series.</b> It extends black and dark brown pigment throughout the plumage.|$|E
50|$|The {{prevailing}} view is {{that the}} Yellowface I mutation, together with the Yellowface II and Blue mutations, are members of an <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> situated at the Blue locus. Although some breeders still dissent from this view it is the one followed here.|$|E
40|$|The blp {{locus of}} Streptococcus pneumoniae secretes and regulates bacteriocins, which mediate both intra- and {{interspecific}} com-petition {{in the human}} nasopharynx. There are four major alleles of the gene blpH, which encodes the receptor responsible for activating the blp locus when bound to one of four distinct peptide pheromones (BlpC). The allelic variation of blpH is presum-ably explained by a need to restrict cross talk between competing strains. The BlpH protein sequences have polymorphisms dis-tributed throughout the sequence, making identification of the peptide binding site difficult to predict. To identify the phero-mone binding sites that dictate pheromone specificity, we have characterized the four major variants and two naturally occurring chimeric versions of blpH in which recombination events appear to have joined two distinct blpH alleles together. Us-ing these <b>allelic</b> variants, a <b>series</b> of laboratory-generated chimeric blpH alleles, and site-directed mutants of both the receptor and peptide, we have demonstrated that BlpC binding to some BlpH types involves an electrostatic interaction between the op-positely charged residues of BlpC and the first transmembrane domain of BlpH. An additional recognition site was identified in the second extracellular loop. We identified naturally occurring BlpH types that {{have the capacity to}} respond to more than one BlpC type; however, this change in specificity results in a commensurate drop in overall sensitivity. These natural recombination events were presumably selected for to balance the need to sense bacteriocin-secreting neighbors with the need to turn on bacte-riocin production at a low density...|$|R
50|$|K {{is another}} {{dominant}} allele of the <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> which controls feather growth rate. One-day-old chicks have primary remiges and coverlets {{of the same}} length (see Figure 2B). In 8- to 12-day-old chicks rectrices are not yet developed (see Figure 1, chick on the right).|$|E
50|$|Contrary to multifactorial slow-feathering genes, which affect only chicks {{carrying}} K, the {{autosomal recessive}} alleles t ("tardy") and ts ("retarded") of the T <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> affect only those chicks {{of the fast}} normal-feathering type. The dominance order is T (normal) > ts ("retarded") > t ("tardy").|$|E
50|$|It {{was found}} that a {{mutation}} in the 'Drosophila' gene, MAD, in the mother, repressed the gene, decapentaplegic, in the embryo. Mad mutations can be placed in an <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> based on the relative severity of the maternal effect enhancement of weak dpp alleles, thus explaining the name Mothers against dpp.|$|E
50|$|Homozygotes Ml/Ml {{are nearly}} all black {{especially}} {{in combination with}} some recessive alleles of the E <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> such as eb (brown) and e+ (wild type), except that females with e+ are black with salmon breasts, while females with eWh are wheaten with dark brown back and hackle. Males are nearly all black.|$|E
50|$|The Clearwing is an {{autosomal}} mutation of the dil locus {{given the}} symbol dilcw, {{and so is}} a member of the multiple <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> which also includes the Dilute (dild) and Greywing (dilgw) mutations. The Clearwing allele is recessive to the wild-type, dominant to the Dilute allele and co-dominant with the Greywing allele.|$|E
5000|$|In other words, Ml {{interacts with}} the {{recessive}} alleles of the E <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> which normally produce non-solid black plumage, [...] "extending" [...] black to zones which otherwise would be of some other color. This gene has little or none effect on the chick down color nor extends black to the shanks.|$|E
5000|$|Ks (...) {{is another}} {{dominant}} allele of the <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> which controls feather growth rate. In one-day-old chicks primary remiges are {{shorter than the}} coverlets. Plumage growing is greatly delayed during the first weeks of juvenile life, but birds of both sexes completely finish plumage growing at twelve weeks of age. This allele {{has no effect on}} adult plumage.|$|E
5000|$|... k+ is {{the most}} {{recessive}} of the <b>allelic</b> <b>series.</b> One-day-old chicks pure for this allele have the primary remiges evidently longer than the coverlets (see Figure 2A) while 8- to 12-day-old chicks show their rectrices well developed (see Figure 1, chick on the left), and they later complete feather growing long before those chicks carrying K.|$|E
5000|$|The loci of the Dark {{mutation}} and the Blue <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> {{are situated}} on the same autosome, so the Dark mutation {{is linked to the}} Blue <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> (see genetic linkage). The cross-over value (COV) or recombination frequency between the Dark and Blue loci is often stated to be about 14%, but several careful measurements of this COV show quite widely varying results. Early measurements by Duncker and independently by Steiner obtained values of 14% and 7.6% respectively, and T G Taylor and C Warner collected results which showed only 5 cross-overs in 140 - a COV of 3.6%.Included in these were results from T G Taylor's own experiments, in which he found no cross-overs in 86 birds bred. [...] It is now known that the environment and other genes can influence the COV, so some variability should be expected. A reasonable average of these measurements is a COV of 8%.|$|E

50|$|Ninety-eight {{percent of}} the {{flowering}} time QTLs identified in this paper were found to affect flowering time by less than one day (as compared to the B73 reference). These relatively small QTL effects, however, were also shown to sum for each family to equal large differences and changes in days to silking. Furthermore, {{it was observed that}} while most QTLs were shared between families, each family appears to have functionally distinct alleles for most QTLs. These observations led the authors to propose a model of “Common genes with uncommon variants” to explain flowering time diversity in maize. They tested their model by documenting an <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> in the previously studied maize flowering time QTL Vgt1 (vegetation-to-transition1) by controlling for genetic background and estimating the effects of vgt1 in each family. They then went on to identify specific sequence variants that corresponded to the <b>allelic</b> <b>series,</b> including one allele containing a miniature transposon strongly associated with early flowering, and other alleles containing SNPs associated with later flowering.|$|E
50|$|The SMAD {{proteins}} are homologs of {{both the}} Drosophila protein, mothers against decapentaplegic (MAD) and the Caenorhabditis elegans protein SMA (from gene sma for small body size). The name is a portmanteau of the two. MAD mutations can be placed in an <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> based on the relative severity of the maternal effect enhancement of weak dpp alleles, thus explaining the name Mothers against dpp.|$|E
5000|$|Solid white plumage is {{the result}} of several {{combinations}} of genes which interact to give the final result. The expression of any color, except white, requires the presence of the normal allele C+, an autosomic dominant allele that allows the synthesis of pigment in the feathers. C+ is the most dominant of the <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> of the locus C with the following order of dominance: ...|$|E
50|$|Kn ("naked") is {{the most}} {{dominant}} of the <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> which controls feather growth rate. It is a gene whose action on feather growth is quite extreme. Birds carrying this gene are nearly naked during juvenile life {{and in some cases}} females remain nearly naked well into adult life. One-day-old chicks lack primary and secondary remiges (they may appear as extremely small pinfeathers, but always shorter than the coverlets).|$|E
50|$|The German Fallow is an {{autosomal}} recessive mutation. It {{has been suggested}} that the German Fallow and the Non-sex-linked Ino are mutations of the same gene, a+, and hence they are given symbols abz and a respectively, but evidence for this <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> is scanty. In the absence of firm evidence, others prefer to assign the German Fallow mutation to its own locus, fg+ in the wild-type, with the symbol fg for the mutant allele.|$|E
50|$|Differential gene {{expression}} {{can be achieved}} by modifying the efficiency of sgRNA base-pairing to the target loci. In theory, modulating this efficiency can be used to create an <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> for any given gene, in essence creating a collection of hypo- and hypermorphs. These powerful collections can be used to probe any genetic investigation. For hypomorphs, this allows the incremental reduction of gene function as opposed to the binary nature of gene knockouts and the unpredictability of knockdowns. For hypermorphs, this is in contrast to the conventional method of cloning the gene of interest under promoters with variable strength.|$|E
50|$|The Selkirk Rex {{is defined}} by an {{autosomal}} dominant woolly rexoid hair (ADWH) abnormality that is characterized by tightly curled hair shafts. A splice variant in the gene KRT71 {{was found to be}} associated with the curly coat phenotype. KRT71 is a crucial gene for keratinization of the hair follicle. An allele of this gene is also responsible for the hairless (hr) Sphynx and the Devon Rex (re) hair.Three mutations in KRT71 have now been identified in cats, forming the <b>allelic</b> <b>series,</b> KRT71SADRE > KRT71+ > KRT71re > KRT71hr, where SADRE is the suggested locus designation for the Selkirk autosomal dominant rex21 allele.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{research}} of using ZFNs to create specific mutations in zebrafish embryo {{has also been}} carried out by other research groups. The kdr gene in zebra fish encodes for the vascular endothelial growth factor-2 receptor. Mutagenic lesions at this target site was induced using ZFN technique {{by a group of}} researchers in US. They suggested that the ZFN technique allows straightforward generation of a targeted <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> of mutants; it does not rely on the existence of species-specific embryonic stem cell lines and is applicable to other vertebrates, especially those whose embryos are easily available; finally, it is also feasible to achieve targeted knock-ins in zebrafish, therefore it is possible to create human disease models that are heretofore inaccessible.|$|E
50|$|The Sphynx hairlessness is {{produced}} by the same gene as the Devon Rex phenotype. Moreover {{it was found that}} the curly coat of Selkirk Rex cats is also associated with this gene. In detail the gene encodes Keratin 71 (KRT71) and is responsible for the keratinization of the hair follicle. The Sphynx mutation leads to a complete loss-of-function where the structure of the hair is damaged so that i.e. the hair can be formed but is easily dislodged. In the Devon Rex mutation a residual activity of the protein still exists. The Selkirk Rex allele (sadr) is dominant over the wild type gene, which is dominant over the Devon Rex allele (re) and the Sphynx (hr) which forms an <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> of : KRT71SADRE > KRT71+ > KRT71re > KRT71hr.|$|E
5000|$|Erives' major work is on “regulatory grammars” for {{transcriptional}} enhancers underlying animal {{development and}} cancer diseases. Exploiting assemblies for animal genomes, Erives discovered complex gene regulatory codes underlie non-homologous subsets of mechanistically-equivalent enhancers. These codes {{are composed of}} a combinatorial “lexicon” of transcription factor (TF) binding sites, functional inflections of those binding sites (so-called “specialized sites” constrained for binding affinity and competition by multiple TFs), and complex site ordering (orientation and positional spacing of those sites). The relationship of these complex regulatory codes within a nucleosomal [...] "regulatory reading frame" [...] is a key goal. His lab’s work also elucidated how a mutational mechanism (microsatellite repeat slippage) plays a significant evolutionary role in functionally adjusting complex binding site arrangements that recruit poly-glutamine rich factors. Correspondingly, Erives lab has pioneered the identification of novel poly-glutamine complex recruiting enhancers that integrate developmental signals, while also identifying polyQ <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> for key developmental factors targeting those enhancers.|$|E

5000|$|From 1997 to 2001, Duboule's {{laboratory}} has {{approached the}} problem of collinearity at the mechanistic level by using ES cell-based genetics; Hox genes are controlled at a global level, which involves their respective positions in the gene cluster. In 2001, a link is established between temporal colinearity (the Hox clock) and the somitic clock, such as to coordinate the progression of somites and their specifications. From 1998 onwards, this laboratory has used two home-designed genetic approaches TAMERE and STRING to embark on an in vivo analysis of large-scale gene regulation, leading to the concepts of ‘regulatory landscapes’ or archipelagos. This large <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> has allowed to recently unravel the mechanisms underlying colinearity in the developing limbs. The axial organization of our legs and arms indeed matches the linear organization of regulatory chromatin domains. The transition between these chromosomal domains matches the wrist, i.e. the transition between the old (arms and legs) and the [...] "novel" [...] (hands and feet) part of our appendages. Duboule has also studied in details the biochemical mechanisms underlying Hox gene regulation the processing of the Hox clock during {{the formation of the}} main body axis. This clock is linked to a transition in chromatin domains, which is accompanied by a step-wise switch of genes from a negative to a positive chromatin compartment. The potential importance and meaning of these observations for our understanding of gene regulation during development and morphological evolution have been discussed in several reviews.|$|E

40|$|We have {{identified}} and characterized a new peripheral myelin protein 22 (Pmp 22) mouse mutant. The mutation {{results in a}} serine to threonine amino acid substitution at residue 72, which is a hot spot for mutation in human PMP 22, leading to the peripheral neuropathy Dejerine-Sottas syndrome. We have previously described two other Pmp 22 mutants, providing an <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> for gene function analysis. Pmp 22 mutations generally lead to abnormal intracellular trafficking of Pmp 22, and we show that each mutant protein in the <b>allelic</b> <b>series</b> has a unique pattern of intracellular localization in transfected cell lines. The mutant protein from the less severely affected mutants occurs in large aggregates, while the mutant protein from the most severely affected mutant occurs in a diffuse perinuclear pattern that largely colocalizes with wild-type protein. This suggests that large Pmp 22 aggregates may be protective in this form of peripheral neuropathy...|$|E
