5|$|Enterprise {{arrives at}} the Valakian homeworld, where they are met by Esaak, the Valakian {{director}} of a clinic, and Larr, a Menk orderly. T'Pol, Phlox, Archer, and Ensign Sato make {{a tour of the}} medical facility. Sato discovers that there is a second lesser-evolved yet unaffected race, the Menk, who live alongside the Valakians. Phlox makes the startling discovery that the Valakians are slowly dying out, not from an easily curable medical condition, but because of a genetic disease which is experiencing an accelerated rate of mutation. He also believes that the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cure may lie in the Menk.|$|E
5|$|He {{then used}} a {{hypothesis}} of local realism {{to conclude that}} the other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.|$|E
5|$|More sportingly, the 5th century BC tragedian Euripides often {{played with}} the old traditions, mocking them, and through the voice of his {{characters}} injecting notes of doubt. Yet the subjects of his plays were taken, without exception, from myth. Many of these plays were written in <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> predecessor's {{version of the same}} or similar myth. Euripides mainly impugns the myths about the gods and begins his critique with an objection similar to the one previously expressed by Xenocrates: the gods, as traditionally represented, are far too crassly anthropomorphic.|$|E

5|$|His {{trial for}} {{obstruction}} of justice was to have begun on March 2, 2009, but jury selection was postponed by 11th-hour appeals by the prosecution. The trial commenced on March 21, 2011, in U. S. District Court, Northern District of California, with Judge Susan Illston presiding. He was convicted on April 13, 2011 on the {{obstruction of justice}} charge, for giving an evasive <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> question under oath. His sentence did not include prison. The conviction was initially upheld by a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2013, but a larger panel of the court voted 10-1 to overturn the conviction on April 22, 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{first story}} is about the opening of Shiva's third eye when he visits Madurai, {{the capital city of}} the Pandya Kingdom, ruled at that time by Shenbagapandian. Shenbagapandian wants to find the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{question}} posed by his wife— whether the fragrance from a woman's hair is natural or artificial— and announces a reward of 1000gold coins to anyone who can come up with the answer. A poor poet named Dharumi desperately wants the reward and starts to break down in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. Shiva, hearing his cries, {{takes the form of a}} poet and gives Dharumi a poem containing the answer. Overjoyed, Dharumi takes the poem to Shenbagapandian's court and recites it, but Nakkeerar, the court's head poet, claims the poem's meaning is incorrect. On hearing this, Shiva argues with Nakkeerar about the poem's accuracy, burning him to ashes when he refuses to relent. Later, Shiva revives Nakkeerar, and says that he only wanted to test his knowledge. Nakkeerar asks the king to give the reward to Dharumi.|$|E

25|$|The cue {{familiarity}} {{hypothesis was}} proposed by Reder and Ritter after completing {{a pair of}} experiments which indicated that individuals can evaluate their ability {{to answer a question}} before trying to answer it. This finding suggests that the question (cue) and not the actual memory (target) is crucial for making metamemory judgments. Consequently, this hypothesis implies that judgements regarding metamemory are based on an individual’s level of familiarity with the information provided in the cue. Therefore, an individual is more likely to judge that they know the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> question if they are familiar with its topic or terms and more likely to judge that they do not know the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> question which presents new or unfamiliar terms.|$|E

25|$|However, this {{initiative}} (radical at the time) was overtaken by events.

25|$|The Zen student's {{mastery of}} a given kōan is {{presented}} to the teacher in a private interview (referred to in Japanese as dokusan (独参), daisan (代参), or sanzen (参禅)).

The teacher may approve or disapprove of the answer and guide the student in the right direction. The interaction with a Zen teacher is central in Zen, but makes Zen practice also vulnerable to misunderstanding and exploitation.|$|E
25|$|Geldner's first {{significant}} publication, though made public only in 1877, was written {{while he was}} still a doctoral student. The essay, which was in its expanded and published form titled Über die Metrik des jüngeren Avesta ("On the meter of the Younger Avesta"), was originally an <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> prize essay question posed by the University of Tübingen's Faculty of Philosophy. His analysis revealed that although the texts had not retained a metrical form, the majority of the manuscripts were in 8 syllable verse (10 or 12 syllable lines also occurred).|$|E
