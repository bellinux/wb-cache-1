40|$|This {{analysis}} examines {{whether the}} legalization of abortion changed high school graduation rates among the children selected into birth. Unless women in all socio-economic circum-stances sought abortions to the same extent, increased use of abortion must have changed the distribution of child development inputs. I find that higher <b>abortion</b> <b>ratios</b> are associated with higher graduation rates for black males, but not other demographic groups. In a pooled analysis, I find that abortion has a significant negative impact on graduation rates. The effect disappears when I control for ethnicity. The cohorts born between 1965 and 1979 contained falling shares of whites, who have relatively high graduation rates. Regression results indicate <b>abortion</b> <b>ratios</b> are linked with the fertility differences between ethnicities, which suggests this is a channel of influence. Overall, the relationship between abortion exposure and educational attainment is small.

The increase in abortions started first among older teenagers, and spread gradually to the younger girls. Regional variation in the rates remained the same throughout the study period. Conclusions.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 Introduction: Nationally, the {{abortion}} rate has fallen {{over the last}} two decades. During the same period, the number restrictions and regulations on abortion have increased, especially after 2010. From 2001 to 2008 the percent of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion has fallen by 7 percentage points indicating a potential decrease in access to abortion services or decreased demand. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the drivers of these declines to tease apart the effect of access, restrictions, family planning, demographic and socioeconomic factors. Methods: This study utilizes data from the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) alongside the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) abortion surveillance data to estimate the trends and levels in state-level abortion by occurrence, age-standardized occurrence, and residence from 1990 to 2012. These values are then used to model resident in-state care-seeking for abortion services controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, access and restrictions. Counterfactual scenarios are constructed to measure unmet need. Results: In almost every state, the <b>abortion</b> <b>ratio</b> by occurrence decreased between 1990 and 2012 with the largest decreases seen in those states with the lowest ratios. Few differences were observed between the birth-rate standardized ratio to the crude estimated occurrence ratio. Over half of the residents in Wyoming, Mississippi and Missouri sought their abortions from other states in 2012. The estimated unmet need in 2012 was 70. 5 abortions per 1, 000 live births to women aged 10 - 49. The largest single impact for reducing this unmet need was predicted for eliminating restrictions in Medicaid funding for abortions. Conclusion: Despite an overall decrease in the <b>abortion</b> <b>ratio</b> over the past decade, the expected <b>abortion</b> <b>ratio</b> would be considerably higher controlling for socioeconomic, demographic and cultural factors if there were more providers, if providers were distributed so every woman had access to a provider in her county and given changes in legislation and abortion restrictions. The largest impact on reducing unmet need was observed for lifting Medicaid funding restrictions, suggesting a disproportionate level of unmet need among low income women. There is also a need for more standardized data on abortion reporting at the state level to monitor the effect of restrictions on access to abortion services and to bolster family planning services in areas with the most unmet need...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Half of Finnish {{abortion}} patients {{already have}} children, {{and one in}} 10 pregnancies ending in abortions started within 12 months of a birth. Thus, many women may not practice contraception effectively during the postpartum period. METHODS: Data from national registers were {{used to create a}} joint data file on pregnancies occurring in Finland over the period 1987 - 1998. The abortion risk (the risk of a conception that leads to an induced abortion) and <b>abortion</b> <b>ratio</b> (the number of conceptions leading to abortions divided by the number leading to deliveries) were analyzed in follow-up periods after all live births to women younger than 45 (684, 922), using hazard regression and logistic regression. RESULTS: Pregnancies starting within eight months postpartum were more likely to end in abortion than were those starting later. Within the first eight months, the shorter the interval to the next pregnancy, the more likely the pregnancy was to end in abortion. Abortion risk was higher 6 - 18 months postpartum than at later periods and was highest at 6 - 8 months postpartum, particularly among unmarried women and teenagers. Between 1987 - 1988 and 1995 - 1996, the abortion risk within the first eight months postpartum rose significantly among women aged 25 - 29 and 30 - 34 (relative risks, 1. 5 and 1. 2, respectively). The abortion risk and <b>abortion</b> <b>ratio</b> were higher among teenagers than among women in other age-groups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that contraceptive practice is less effective postpartum, suggesting room for improvement in postpartum contraceptive counseling in Finland...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify induced abortion and teenage birth indicators for this group. Methods: The population comprised all female asylum seekers aged 15 - 49 in The Netherlands between September 2004 and August 2005. Information was collected about induced abortions from notification forms and electronic patient files. The central agency for the reception of asylum seekers provided population and birth data. Results: Among asylum seekers the abortion rate (14. 4 / 1000 women) and teenage birth rate (49. 1 / 1000) were higher than average in The Netherlands (8. 6 / 1000 and 5. 8 / 1000). Great differences were found between subgroups. High abortion rates were seen among women who were pregnant on arrival or got pregnant in the first months after arrival at the reception facilities. Abortion and teenage birth rates were particularly high among asylum seekers aged 15 - 19 from specific parts of Africa and Asia. <b>Abortion</b> <b>ratios</b> were high among asylum seekers aged 30 - 49 from parts of Europe and Asia.

In 2006, as during the previous decade (1997 [...] 2006), women aged 20 [...] 29 years accounted for the majority (56. 8 %) of abortions and had the highest abortion rates (29. 9 abortions per 1, 000 women aged 20 [...] 24 years and 22. 2 abortions per 1, 000 women aged 25 [...] 29 years); by contrast, abortion ratios were highest at the extremes of reproductive age. Adolescents aged 15 [...] 19 years accounted for 16. 5 % of all abortions in 2006 and had an abortion rate of 14. 8 abortions per 1, 00...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{proposed}} two recovery solutions {{over the}} existing error-free utility accrual scheduling algorithm known as General Utility Accrual Scheduling algorithm (or GUS) proposed by Peng Li [1]. A robust fault recovery algorithm called Backward Recovery GUS (or BRGUS) works by adapting the time redundancy model i. e., by re-executing the affected task after its transient error period is over. The BRGUS is {{compared with a}} less complicated recovery algorithm named as Abortion Recovery GUS (or ARGUS) that simply aborts all faulty tasks. Our main objectives are (1) to maximize the total accrued utility and (2) to ensure correctness of the executed tasks on best effort basis and achieve the fault free tasks as much as possible. Our simulation results reveal that BRGUS outperforms the ARGUS algorithm with higher accrued utility and less <b>abortion</b> <b>ratio,</b> making it more suitable and efficient in adaptive real time system...|$|E
40|$|Many {{countries}} with "deficits" in their female population see banning sex-selective abortion {{as a way}} to curb the observed sex imbalance without discussing potentially negative unintended consequences of this ban on female survival rates as parents may be forced to substitute post-natal for pre-natal sex-selection. This paper presents novel empirical evidence on the impact of access to <b>abortion</b> on sex <b>ratios</b> at birth and relative female infant mortality. We use the universe of birth and death registry data from Taiwan and exploit plausibly exogenous variation in the availability of sex-selective abortion caused by the legalization of abortions to identify the causal effects of sex-selective <b>abortion</b> on sex <b>ratios</b> at birth and excess female mortality. We find that sex-selective abortion increased the fraction of males at birth by approximately 0. 7 percentage-points, accounting for approximately 100 % of the observed increase in sex ratios at birth during the 1980 s; and it decreased relative female neo-natal mortality by approximately 25 %. We estimate that approximately 15 more female infants survived for every 100 aborted female fetuses. Economics of Gender; Fertility...|$|R
50|$|Despite a {{significant}} reduction in the <b>abortion</b> to birth <b>ratio</b> since the mid-1990s, the countries of the former Soviet Union maintain the highest rate of abortions in the world. In 2001, 1.31 million children were born in Russia, while 2.11 million abortions were performed. In 2005, 1.6 million abortions were registered in Russia; 20% of these involved girls under the age of 18. Official statistics put the number at 989,000 in 2011.|$|R
40|$|As of 1 January 2000 the {{government}} of the north-eastern Italian region of Friuli- Venezia Giulia (FVG) introduced a substantial bonus at birth. The birth bonus was differentiated by marital status (only married women were eligible), citizenship (only Italians were eligible), and birth order (the bonus grew for the second and especially the third birth). Moreover, the income threshold below which one got the bonus was fairly high. As of 1 January 2004 a new government substantially reduced the bonus amount as well as the upper income limit. We evaluate if the bonuses handed out in FVG during those four years (2000 - 03) {{had a significant impact on}} fertility and abortion choices, verifying whether fertility changed in a different way for women more affected by the new legislation. We also test if the impact of monetary measures was higher for less educated women, because in Italy the relationship between income and education is very strong, and the bonus was practically the same irrespective of income level, hence its relative impact should be stronger in a poorer family. We use two different methods: First, we compare the trends of births and <b>abortion</b> <b>ratios,</b> separately for women affected and not affected by the monetary measures, looking at the differential changes. Second, using log-linear models, we measure if the interactions among time, parity, marital status, citizenship and education are statistically significant in the direction that follows our expectations. Our results show that for low educated (and hence also less rich) women with one or (especially) two and more children, birth trends did change after 1999, whereas the trends for childless women living in FVG and for low-educated women living in other Italian regions did not change...|$|R
