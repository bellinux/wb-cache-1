The cultured cells could be shown to express the HLA-A and -B antigens using a multispecific <b>allo-antiserum</b> and a rabbit anti-beta- 2 microglobulin antibody. The tumour cells were negative for the HLA-DR determinants when tested with either rabbit anti-Ia-like antisera or specific anti-HLA-DR allo-antisera. They also failed to stimulate allogeneic lymphocytes in primary mixed lymphocyte-tumour cell cultures but stimulated lymphocytes primed to tumour cells in vitro.

40|$|Summary. -The {{lability}} of cell surface histocompatibility antigens of 2 murine lymphomata was examined. These 2 tumours differ {{greatly in}} {{their capacity to}} metastasize in syngeneic hosts. Cells of the metastatic lymphoma released histo-compatibility antigens in vivo and in vitro at a greater rate than cells of the non-metastasizing lymphoma. Antigen/antibody complexes formed {{by the addition of}} <b>allo-antiserum</b> to intact cells disappeared more rapidly from the surface of cells of the metastatic line. We propose that the instability of surface antigens may be an integral feature of malignant cells and {{that there may be a}} quantitative relationship between the lability of membrane components and the capacity of the tumour to metastasize. THE RATE of release of tumour specific transplantation antigens (TSTA) into the supernatants of rat fibrosarcoma cell cultures was found to be greater from a cell line which metastasizes in vivo tha...|$|E
