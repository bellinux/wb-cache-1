5|$|<b>Almost</b> <b>any</b> {{substance}} containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation.

5|$|Dürer's {{well-known}} engraving Melencolia I {{depicts a}} frustrated thinker sitting by a truncated triangular trapezohedron and a magic square.

She also expressed fears that the court had so broadened the definition of predisposition as to make it a viable defense in <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> case.|$|E
5|$|The Hawthorns is {{certificated}} {{under the}} highest UEFA pitch surfaces {{which means it}} is ready to host <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> competition if required.
