5|$|Another {{study has}} implicated EFS in the Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS). This rare and severe autosomal recessive disorder associated with partial albinism, peripheral neuropathy, mild coagulation defects and propensity to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, caused by incomplete phagocytosis due to failure in phagolysosome formation. This work identified a direct interaction in vitro and in vivo between EFS and LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator, aka CHS1 - Chediak-Higashi syndrome 1), a large protein that regulates the intracellular trafficking of proteins through endosomes that is mutated in CHS. These results may imply {{the role of}} EFS <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> progression modifier, although further testing and establishment of mechanism is necessary.|$|E
5|$|As a crop, the {{blackcurrant}} {{suffers from}} several pests and diseases. The most serious disease is reversion, {{caused by a}} virus transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite. Another is {{white pine blister rust}} which alternates between two unrelated hosts, one in the genus Ribes (blackcurrant included) and the other a white pine. This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America, where the native white pines have no genetic resistance to the disease. As a result, the blackcurrant has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts of the United States <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> vector. The effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable, since other Ribes species also host the disease and are native to North America.|$|E
5|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a common}} condition (prevalence >1:500) characterized by abnormal thickening of the ventricular muscle, classically in the intraventricular septal wall. HCM is described <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> of the sarcomere, because mutations in the contractile proteins of the sarcomere {{have been identified in}} about half of patients with HCM. The cTnC mutations that have been associated with HCM are A8V, L29Q, A31S, C84Y, D145E. In all cases, the mutation was identified in a single patient, so additional genetic testing is needed to confirm or refute the clinical significance of these mutations. With most of these mutations (and with HCM-associated thin filament mutations in general), an increase in cardiac calcium sensitivity has been observed.|$|E

5|$|In Japan, kitsunetsuki {{was noted}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> {{as early as}} the Heian period and {{remained}} a common diagnosis for mental illness until the early 20th century. Possession was the explanation for the abnormal behavior displayed by the afflicted individuals. In the late 19th century, Dr. Shunichi Shimamura noted that physical diseases that caused fever were often considered kitsunetsuki. The belief has lost favor, but stories of fox possession still occur, such as allegations that members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult had been possessed.|$|E
5|$|No {{effort to}} depict vampires in popular fiction was as {{influential}} or as definitive as Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897). Its portrayal of vampirism <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> of contagious demonic possession, with its undertones of sex, blood and death, {{struck a chord}} in Victorian Europe where tuberculosis and syphilis were common. The vampiric traits described in Stoker's work merged with and dominated folkloric tradition, eventually evolving into the modern fictional vampire.|$|E
5|$|Obesity is {{a leading}} {{preventable}} cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2015, 600 million adults (12%) and 100 million children were obese. Obesity {{is more common in}} women than men. Authorities view it {{as one of the most}} serious public health problems of the 21stcentury. Obesity is stigmatized in much of the modern world (particularly in the Western world), though it was seen as a symbol of wealth and fertility at other times in history and still is in some parts of the world. In 2013, the American Medical Association classified obesity <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

25|$|Carol Judge {{underwent}} {{treatment for}} alcoholism during her tenure as First Lady. She then led {{the campaign to}} legally classify alcoholism <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> after the American Medical Association revised its own position. Montana changed its state law to reclassify alcoholism <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> in 1975. In 1977, Carol Judge {{was appointed to the}} Liaison Panel on Alcohol Related Problems for the President's Mental Health Commission. She met with U.S. First Lady Rosalynn Carter in Washington D.C. to discuss alcoholism and mental health issues. In the 1980s, after leaving the position of First Lady, Carol Judge established a state treatment program to treat nurses with substance abuse programs.|$|E
25|$|That {{even though}} {{alcoholism}} is not solely a medical condition, it is therapeutically effective {{to explain it}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> to patients. The disease concept encourages patients {{to take responsibility for}} their drinking, without debilitating guilt.|$|E

25|$|Issues {{surrounding}} the Catholic Church and AIDS became highly controversial since 1990, primarily because many prominent Catholic leaders publicly declared {{their opposition to}} the use of condoms <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> preventative.

25|$|The {{discussion}} whether aging {{should be}} viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> or not has important implications. It would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the United States of America, it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the FDA. Anti-aging now falls under the regulations for cosmetic medicine which are less tight than those for drugs.|$|E
25|$|Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) is {{a leading}} cause of death in the world. It was identified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> in 1981. Two years later the etiology agent for AIDS, the HIV was described. HIV is a retrovirus and has two major serotypes, HIV-1 and HIV-2. The pandemic mostly involves HIV-1 while HIV-2 has lower morbidity rate and is mainly restricted to western Africa.|$|E

25|$|Some critics {{dispute the}} {{portrayal}} of aging <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease.</b> For example, Leonard Hayflick, who determined that fibroblasts are limited to around 50cell divisions, reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of entropy. Hayflick and fellow biogerontologists Jay Olshansky and Bruce Carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to {{what they see as}} unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti-aging supplements.|$|E
25|$|Pre-test {{probability}} and post-test probability (alternatively spelled {{pretest and}} posttest probability) are the probabilities {{of the presence of}} a condition (such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease)</b> before and after a diagnostic test, respectively. Post-test probability, in turn, can be positive or negative, depending on whether the test falls out as a positive test or a negative test, respectively. In some cases, it is used for the probability of developing the condition of interest in the future.|$|E
25|$|Reduced {{penetrance}} is {{a phenomenon}} where a fully inherited genetic trait, such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> or disorder, fails to exhibit the expected phenotype. This {{has been reported in}} some cases of iminoglycinuria. Here, system IMINO is thought {{to play a role in}} reduced penetrance of iminoglycinuria by compensating for imino acid malabsorption related specifically to mutations of PAT2. Conversely, SIT1 mutations are believed to result in full expression of iminoglycinuria in some cases where heterozygous mutations of PAT2 would otherwise have only been sufficient to cause hyperglycinuria.|$|E

Acute leukaemia is rare, but about 1 in 2 000 people will develop the disease. The two acute forms in children are acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).
