5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Imperial Japanese Navy was finally gaining {{authorization}} for its 'eight-eight battlefleet'. The , authorized in 1916, carried eight 16-inch guns like their <b>American</b> <b>counterparts.</b> The next year's naval bill authorized two more battleships {{and two more}} battlecruisers. The battleships, which became the , were to carry ten 16-inch guns. The battlecruisers, the , also carried ten 16-inch guns and were designed {{to be capable of}} 30 knots, capable of beating both the British Admiral- and the USNavy's Lexington-class battlecruisers.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} home {{to at least one}} al-Qaeda leader before bin Laden. Operational chief Abu Faraj al-Libi {{reportedly}} moved his family to Abbottabad in mid-2003. Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) raided the house in December 2003 but did not find him. However, this account was exposed as an outright lie by American officials who said that satellite photos show that in 2004 the site was an empty field. A courier told interrogators that al-Libi used three houses in Abbottabad. Pakistani officials say they informed their <b>American</b> <b>counterparts</b> {{at the time that the}} city could be a hiding place for al-Qaeda leaders. In 2009 officials began providing the U.S. with intelligence about bin Laden's compound without knowing who lived there.|$|E
5|$|At about 01:25 on 13 November, in near-complete {{darkness}} {{due to the}} {{bad weather}} and dark moon, the ships of the Imperial Japanese force entered the sound between Savo Island and Guadalcanal and prepared to bombard Henderson Field with the special ammunition loaded for the purpose. The ships arrived from an unexpected direction, coming not down the slot but from {{the west side of}} Savo Island, thus entering the sound from the northwest rather than the north. Unlike their <b>American</b> <b>counterparts,</b> the Japanese sailors had drilled and practiced night fighting extensively, conducting frequent live-fire night gunnery drills and exercises. This experience would be telling in not only the pending encounter, but in several other fleet actions off Guadalcanal in the months to come.|$|E

5|$|Bo {{presided over}} a {{continued}} rise in foreign investment in China as Minister of Commerce. His daily schedule was dominated by receiving foreign guests and dignitaries. By {{the time that he}} became Minister, he spoke relatively fluent and colloquial English. During a meeting with American officials, Bo reputedly told a struggling interpreter to stop translating because the Chinese officials could understand English and it was wasting time. In May 2004 Bo {{was one of the few}} ministers hand-picked to accompany Premier Wen Jiabao on a five-country trip to Europe. The trade policy of the United States toward China also sparked significant controversy. Bo maintained a conciliatory but assertive attitude as he attended talks in Washington. On his trips to the United States, he conducted substantive discussions with his <b>American</b> <b>counterparts</b> and signed agreements on intellectual property, the services sector, agricultural products, food safety, and consumer protection.|$|E
5|$|Chambers transitioned {{into the}} senior ranks soon after, taking the 100m silver medal behind his British {{teammate}} Darren Campbell at the 1998 European Championships. He achieved a new personal best in September at the 1998 IAAF World Cup with {{a run of}} 10.03s for third place and won a relay gold medal. At the 1998 Commonwealth Games he was a 100m semi finalist and set a games record {{as part of the}} 4×100m relay team. His ability attracted the attention of former sprinter and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Mike McFarlane, who became his coach. He came first in the 100m in the 1999 European Cup, then at a meet in Nuremberg he became only the second European sprinter (after Linford Christie) to break the ten second barrier with a time of 9.99s. Fellow British sprinter Jason Gardener scored a time of 9.98s in Lausanne soon after, becoming the third Briton to break the barrier. In spite of this, Chambers remained some distance behind his North <b>American</b> <b>counterparts.</b>|$|E
5|$|General Paul D. Harkins, {{commander}} of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), made a much more optimistic assessment of the battle. He considered the operation {{to be a major}} success; after the Viet Cong abandoned their positions, the South Vietnamese units captured the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi. Harkins' evaluation of the battle's success was based on US military doctrine from World War II, in which opposing forces fought a conventional combined arms battle with the objective, on each side, of gaining control of the opponent's territory. The Viet Cong, however, were more interested in exposing the weaknesses of Diem's regime and its military. Moyar (2008) argues that Harkins' resolutely optimistic assessments based on conventional doctrine avoided recognizing shortcomings in tactics and battle readiness and in the arrangement under which ARVN commanders and their <b>American</b> <b>counterparts</b> and advisers were operating. Largely because of his attitude, neither the South Vietnamese nor the American commands learned useful lessons from the battle.|$|E

5|$|Some new bands, such as London's Alternative TV, Edinburgh's Rezillos, and Leamington's the Shapes, {{identified}} with the scene even as they pursued more experimental music. Others of a comparatively traditional rock 'n' roll bent were also swept up by the movement: the Vibrators, formed as a pub rock–style act in February 1976, soon adopted a punk look and sound. A few even longer-active bands including Surrey neo-mods the Jam and pub rockers the Stranglers and Cock Sparrer also became associated with the punk rock scene. Alongside the musical roots shared with their <b>American</b> <b>counterparts</b> and the calculated confrontationalism of the early Who, the British punks also reflected the influence of glam rock and related bands such as Slade, T.Rex, and Roxy Music. One of the groups openly acknowledging that influence were the Undertones, from Derry in Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{planned to}} have the K-25 plant in full {{production}} by June or July 1945. Having taken two years to get the prototype stages working, the British experts regarded this as incredibly optimistic, and felt that, barring a miracle, it {{would be unlikely to}} reach that point before the end of 1946. This opinion offended their <b>American</b> <b>counterparts</b> and dampened the enthusiasm for cooperation, and the British mission returned to the United Kingdom in January 1944. Armed with the British Mission's report, Chadwick and Oliphant were able to persuade Groves to reduce K-25's enrichment target; the output of K-25 would be enriched to weapons grade by being fed into the electromagnetic plant. Despite the British Mission's pessimistic forecasts, K-25 was producing enriched uranium in June 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Apache's first {{operational}} {{tour was}} {{as part of}} 16 Air Assault Brigade in Afghanistan; there were eight Apache AH1s deployed in Afghanistan in February 2007. These were drawn from No. 656 Squadron and No. 664 Squadron of 9 Regiment AAC, based at Dishforth Airfield. Unlike their <b>American</b> <b>counterparts</b> in Afghanistan, the Apache AH1 is deployed with its Longbow Fire Control Radar to enable the pilot to better manage traffic in their airspace. Initially pilots had to often fly for 16–18 {{hours at a time}} due to the low number of Apaches in the theatre; typically each Apache would be stationed in Afghanistan for eight weeks before returning to Britain for roughly eight weeks of maintenance. On 22 May 2006, a UK Apache operating in Afghanistan's Helmand province used a Hellfire missile to destroy an abandoned French vehicle to protect sensitive equipment.|$|E

5|$|Scherger {{served as}} Officer Commanding No.2 Training Group at RAAF Station Wagga from July 1943 {{until he was}} {{appointed}} AOC of the newly formed No.10 Operational Group (No.10 OG) in November. The Air Force's main mobile strike force, No.10 OG at its formation consisted of No.77 Wing, operating A-31 Vengeance dive bombers, and No.78 Wing, operating P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, as well as various ancillary units. Promoted to acting air commodore in January 1944, Scherger established his headquarters at Nadzab, Papua New Guinea, {{in support of the}} US Fifth Air Force. Though able to launch No.78 Wing's first mission that same month, he had to deal with several organisational problems to bring all his squadrons to combat readiness, including lack of training in tropical conditions, and shortcomings in aircraft maintenance and staff rotation that resulted in the RAAF's operational rate of effort being inferior to similar USAAF formations. These issues were overcome later in the year and No.10 OG units began exceeding the rate of effort of their <b>American</b> <b>counterparts.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{confusion in the}} literature over the naming of Russula brevipes. Some early 20th-century American mycologists {{referred to it as}} Russula delica, although that fungus was described from Europe by Elias Fries with a description not accurately matching the North <b>American</b> <b>counterparts.</b> Fries's concept of R.delica included: a white fruit body that did not change color; a smooth, shiny cap; and thin, widely spaced gills. To add to the confusion, Rolf Singer and later Robert Kühner and Henri Romagnesi described other species they named Russula delica. Robert Shaffer summarized the taxonomic conundrum in 1964: Russula delica is a species that everybody knows, so to speak, but the evidence indicates that R.delica sensu Fries (1838) is not R.delica sensu Singer (1938), which in turn is not R.delica sensu Kühner and Romagnesi (1953)…It is best to use R.brevipes for the North American collections which most authors but not Kühner and Romagnesi (1953), call R.delica. The name, R.brevipes, is attached to a type collection, has a reasonably explicit original description, and provides a stable point about which a species concept can be formed.|$|E
5|$|Dickov {{suffered}} several injuries {{over the}} course of the season, including a back problem, a knee injury and a toe injury, the latter sidelining him for four months. Dickov made nine starts and seven substitute appearances in 2006–07, but failed to score a single goal. In May 2007 he announced his interest in pursuing a coaching role when he retires. He was transfer listed by Manchester City in August. He joined Crystal Palace on a three-month loan on 31 August 2007. He played his first game for the Eagles in a friendly against Crystal Palace Baltimore, Crystal Palace's <b>American</b> <b>counterparts,</b> on Friday 7 September, playing the full 90 minutes. On 31 January 2008, Dickov joined Blackpool managed by Simon Grayson on loan until May. Two days later he scored on his debut for Blackpool, what proved to be the winning goal in the Seasiders' 2–1 victory against Leicester City, one of his former clubs, at Bloomfield Road. He had come on as a 70th-minute substitute and scored the winning goal in the 89th minute. It was his first goal since 2 January 2006. He went on to score five goals in his first five appearances for the club, and on 4 March he was named as the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA)'s Fans Championship Player of the Month for February. By the end of his loan, Dickov had scored six goals in eleven appearances. He returned to Manchester City after his loan before then being released at the end of the season.|$|E
