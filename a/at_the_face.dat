Examples of counterfeits from Operation Bernhard have appeared at auction and been sold through dealers for a higher face value than the original £5. There are also examples of the notes in the museum of the National Bank of Belgium and the Bank of England Museum.|$|E

40|$|The {{finite element}} model is used to {{simulate}} {{the behavior of the}} full scale instrumented anchored reinforced wall. The validated {{finite element model}} is then used to carry out parametric studies to ascertain the influence of the boundary conditions on the behavior of the wall. <b>The</b> boundaries <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crest, <b>facing</b> and base of the wall are varied to study their effects. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> crest of the wall, slope surcharge of various geometrical dimensions are imposed. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>facing</b> of <b>the</b> wall, the boundary is allowed to yield laterally by inserting a compressible geoinclusion <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back <b>face</b> of <b>the</b> wall panels. Meanwhile, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base, the boundary is allowed to yield vertically by allowing the wall to sit on a compressible foundation soil. The behavior of the wall is determined in terms of the tensile stress distribution developed in the reinforcing bars, the summation of the maximum tension in the reinforcing bars, the summation of <b>the</b> tensions developed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> connection to <b>the</b> <b>facing</b> panels, <b>the</b> lateral movement <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>facing</b> and <b>the</b> vertical movement <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base...|$|R

25|$|Face: The face {{category}} is about {{who has a}} classically beautiful face. Judges examine the eyes, the nose, the teeth, the lips {{and the structure of}} the face.

25|$|A very {{profitable}} type of seignorage {{is from the}} international circulation of banknotes. While the cost of printing banknotes is minimal, the foreign entity must provide goods and services <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> value of the note to obtain it. The banknote is retained because the entity values it as a store of value because of mistrust of the local currency.|$|E

If all {{the other}} teams passed the Face Off (either by beating another team or by penalty), the remaining team did not receive a time penalty and could continue racing. In the 2nd Chinese version, if the teams cannot finish the Face Off, they must wait until the last team finishes the 15-minute penalty to perform another 15-minute penalty before continue racing.|$|E
25|$|The Platinum Koala {{never reached}} the {{popularity}} of the American Platinum Eagle, mostly because it has not been advertised in the US. Like most investment platinum coins, Platinum Koalas are sealed in a protective plastic case. The coins are sold at prices that reflect the current price of platinum, and not <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> value printed on the coin. Since November 1986, the Perth Mint has used more than 18 tonnes of platinum for minting. About 85% of the coins were sold abroad making the Gold Corporation (owner of the Mint) one of Australia's top 30 export earners.|$|E

25|$|A typical plywood {{panel has}} face veneers {{of a higher}} grade than the core veneers. The {{principal}} function of the core layers {{is to increase the}} separation between the outer layers where the bending stresses are highest, thus increasing the panel's resistance to bending. As a result, thicker panels can span greater distances under the same loads. In bending, the maximum stress occurs in the outermost layers, one in tension, the other in compression. Bending stress decreases from the maximum <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> layers to nearly zero at the central layer. Shear stress, by contrast, is higher {{in the center of the}} panel, and at the outer fibres.|$|E
25|$|Many clergy were imprisoned at Dachau. The first Churchman {{arrived at}} Dachau in 1935, but from 1940, Dachau became the {{concentration}} point for clerical prisoners of the Nazi regime. Prior to this, {{in the early}} stages of the camp, the SS had permitted a local priest to say mass on Sundays in the camp, but invented discouragements for prisoners to attend: following the first Catholic mass in July 1933, those who attended were lined in ranks and forced to spit at, then lick <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the others lined up, before being beaten. The attendant priest was also humiliated and spied upon, but was permitted to hear confessions – in the presence of an SS guard. Ultimately, the SS scheduled extra work for mass attendees and told the priest that none but two wished to attend mass, at which point the priest ceased to visit.|$|E
25|$|The chancel arch is double-chamfered on {{both sides}} with part-octagonal {{responds}} and crenellated capitals. At the lower part is a late 19th-century wooden rood screen of Perpendicular style, of three sectionsvoided in the centre section and void above with panelling below in the outer, and tracery above in all, the top line with crenellations. The chancel and both side chapels are separated by screens of the same style and date, and include openings to the north and south chapels. Sited <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the screens within the chancel, and part of the same design, are choir stalls of mirror repeat. Behind the screens are chapels, north and south, each defined by two Perpendicular chancel bays, the north with heavily moulded arches, the south double-chamfered. The north is set on side responds and central piers of semi-circular facets with hollows between, and part-octagonal capitals. The south is set on half-pier responds on part-octagonal capitals attached to extension of the arch double-chamfer. The chancel stained glass east window is by Ward and Hughes, c.1970. On either side of the window is a corner niche with 19th-century figures. Further church stained glass is by Powell & Sons.|$|E

40|$|In this study, an {{analytical}} model is developed {{in order to}} calculate the temperature distribution in orthogonal cutting with dual-zone contact <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rake <b>face.</b> <b>The</b> study focuses on heat generation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> primary shear zone and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rake <b>face.</b> <b>The</b> material behavior <b>at</b> <b>the</b> primary shear zone is represented by Johnson-Cook constitutive equation whereas <b>the</b> contact <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rake <b>face</b> is modeled by sticking and sliding friction zones. This new temperature distribution model allows obtaining <b>the</b> maximum temperature <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rake <b>face</b> and helps determining two dimensional temperature distribution in the chip. The simulation results obtained from the developed model are also compared with experimental results where good agreement is observed...|$|R

500|$|Emperor Shah Jahan {{maintained}} a rigorous schedule during his entire thirty years rule {{and used to}} get up at 4 AM and, after ablutions and prayers, religiously appeared at the jharokha window to show himself to his subjects. During his stay in Agra or Delhi, huge crowds used to assemble to receive his darshan below the balcony. He would appear before the public 45 minutes after sunrise. His subjects would bow before him which he would reciprocate with his imperial salute. There was one particular group of people known as darshaniyas (akin to the guilds of Augustales of the Roman Empire) who were [...] "servile" [...] to the king and who would take their food only after they had a look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the emperor which they considered as auspicious. More than half an hour had to be spent by the King at the balcony as {{it was the only time}} people could submit petitions to the king directly through the chain let down for the purpose (which was drawn up by attendants) of receiving such petitions by passing the nobles of the court. At one time in 1657 when Shah Jahan was sick he could not appear for the Jharokha Darshan which spread speculations of his death.|$|E
