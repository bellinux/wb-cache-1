5|$|The American {{black duck}} is an {{omnivorous}} species with a diverse diet. It feeds by dabbling {{in shallow water}} and grazing on land. Its plant diet primarily includes {{a wide variety of}} wetland grasses and sedges, and the seeds, stems, leaves and root stalks of <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants,</b> such as eelgrass, pondweed and smartweed. Its animal diet includes mollusks, snails, amphipods, insects, mussels and small fishes.|$|E
5|$|The winter diet {{is mainly}} plant {{material}} including seeds and rhizomes of <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants,</b> but the pintail sometimes feeds on roots, grain and other seeds in fields, though less frequently than other Anas ducks.

In captivity, a bog turtle can be fed a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as meat such as liver, chicken hearts, and tinned dog food. Bog turtles feed only during the day, but rarely during the hottest hours, consuming their food on land or in the water.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} fifteen years, the <b>Aquatic</b> <b>Plant</b> Control Research Program (APCRP) has pursued {{development}} of personal computer (PC) -based information systems for tech-nology transfer in <b>aquatic</b> <b>plant</b> management. Initial devel-opment was limited to DOS compatible simulation models and other computational tools. Though effective in generat-ing computational information for several control tech-niques, the DOS operating system did not allow the models to be interlinked with other information sources required for development of effective <b>aquatic</b> <b>plant</b> management tech-nology transfer tools. However, {{the advent of the}} WINDOWS operating system and ensuing software advances for PC’s have allowed the recent development of more comprehen-sive information systems.

5|$|For half of {{the year}} or longer, adults live in slow-flowing river margins, lakes, or ponds, where {{reproduction}} takes place. Males perform a courtship display, and females lay around 200 eggs individually onto leaves of <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants.</b> Larvae develop two to four months in the water before reaching metamorphosis. For the remainder of the year, the newts live in shady land habitats, usually forests. Although not yet considered threatened, Danube crested newt populations have declined significantly, the reason being mainly habitat loss. The species is protected by law in the European Union.|$|E
5|$|Like {{almost any}} herbivore, they consume other plants if {{presented}} with them, but their diet in nature consists {{almost entirely of}} grass, with only minimal consumption of <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants.</b> Hippos are born with sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from their mothers' feces to digest vegetation. Hippos have (rarely) been filmed eating carrion, usually close to the water. There are other reports of meat-eating, and even cannibalism and predation. The stomach anatomy of a hippo is not suited to carnivory, and meat-eating is likely caused by aberrant behaviour or nutritional stress.|$|E

5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants.</b> They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1960s and 1970s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of hadrosaurids like Edmontosaurus {{was that they}} were aquatic and fed on <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants.</b> An example of this is William Morris's 1970 interpretation of an edmontosaur skull with nonbony beak remnants. He proposed that the animal had a diet much like that of some modern ducks, filtering plants and aquatic invertebrates like mollusks and crustaceans from the water and discharging water via V-shaped furrows along the inner face of the upper beak. This interpretation of the beak has been rejected, as the furrows and ridges are more like those of herbivorous turtle beaks than the flexible structures seen in filter-feeding birds.|$|E

5|$|Danube crested newts {{have the}} longest aquatic {{phase in the}} genus Triturus. Adults move to their {{breeding}} sites in February or March and usually stay there for six months; occasionally, they may even stay longer or return to the water in autumn. Males court females with a display of ritualised body movements. When they have gained the female's interest, they guide it over a spermatophore they deposit on the ground, which the female then takes up with her cloaca. The eggs are fertilised internally. As in other crested newts, a female lays around 200 eggs per season, which are folded individually into leaves of <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants.</b> Larvae develop over two to four months until they reach metamorphosis and leave the water.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the ruff’s diet consists almost exclusively {{of the adults}} and larva of terrestrial and aquatic insects such as beetles and flies. On migration and during the winter, the ruff eats insects (including caddis flies, water-beetles, mayflies and grasshoppers), crustaceans, spiders, molluscs, worms, frogs, small fish, and also the seeds of rice and other cereals, sedges, grasses and <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants.</b> Migrating birds in Italy varied their diet according to what was available at each stopover site. Green aquatic plant material, spilt rice and maize, flies and beetles were found, along with varying amounts of grit. On the main wintering grounds in West Africa, rice is a favoured food during the later part of the season as the ricefields dry out.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{habitats}} include rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, {{marshes and}} bogs. Although some organisms are found across {{most of these}} habitats, the majority have more specific requirements. The water velocity, its temperature and oxygen saturation are important factors, but in river systems, there are fast and slow sections, pools, bayous and backwaters which provide a range of habitats. Similarly, <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants</b> can be floating, semi-submerged, submerged or grow in permanently or temporarily saturated soils besides bodies of water. Marginal plants provide important habitat for both invertebrates and vertebrates, and submerged plants provide oxygenation of the water, absorb nutrients and {{play a part in}} the reduction of pollution.|$|E

IKONOS imagery with four multispectral bands similar to Landsat TM bands 1 - 4 and high spatial resolution (4 -m multispectral and 1 -m panchromatic) is potentially well suited for <b>aquatic</b> <b>plant</b> surveys in lakes and wetlands. To explore the capabilities of IKONOS imagery for <b>aquatic</b> <b>plant</b> surveys, we acquired several IKONOS images for surface water bodies, including a September 1, 2001 image for Swan Lake in Nicollet County, Minnesota. Swan Lake is a large (over 3600 ha) type- 4 wetland {{with an abundance of}} aquatic vegetation. Results based on analysis and classification of a pan-sharpened multispectral IKONOS image demonstrated the potential to identify and map different <b>aquatic</b> <b>plant</b> groups throughout the image. With further research we expect to identify more specific <b>aquatic</b> <b>plant</b> types. This study indicates that the use of IKONOS imagery for <b>aquatic</b> <b>plant</b> surveys is promising. We also are conducting analyses of imagery from several other areas with a variety of landscapes and aquatic vegetation. The high spatial resolution of the IKONOS imagery enables the assessment of aquatic vegetation variation within lakes and wetlands that cannot be obtained from Landsat data and the multispectral data enable classification beyond what is commonly done with aerial photography...|$|R
5|$|Volcanic ash {{can have}} a {{detrimental}} {{impact on the environment}} which can be difficult to predict due to the large variety of environmental conditions that exist within the ash fall zone. Natural waterways can be impacted {{in the same way as}} urban water supply networks. Ash will increase water turbidity which can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants</b> and consequently affect species which are dependent on them such as fish and shellfish. High turbidity can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. Acidification will also occur, which will reduce the pH of the water and impact the fauna and flora living in the environment. Fluoride contamination will occur if the ash contains high concentrations of fluoride.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are herbivores, grazing {{mainly on}} grasses and <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants,</b> {{as well as}} fruit and tree bark. They are very {{selective}} feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat {{a greater variety of}} plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season. Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so are not consumed at that time. The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side. Capybaras are autocoprophagous, meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle. As is the case with other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses; their cheek teeth also grow continuously.|$|E
5|$|Females usually {{engage with}} several males over a {{breeding}} season. The eggs are fertilised internally in the oviduct. The female deposits them individually on leaves of <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants,</b> {{such as water}} cress or floating sweetgrass, usually close to the surface, and, using her hindlegs, folds the leaf around the eggs as protection from predators and radiation. In the absence of suitable plants, the eggs may also be deposited on leaf litter, stones, or even plastic bags. In the northern crested newt, a female takes around five minutes for the deposition of one egg. Crested newt females usually lay around 200 eggs per season, while the marbled newt (T. marmoratus) can lay up to 400. Triturus embryos are usually light-coloured, 1.8–2mm in diameter with a 6mm jelly capsule, which distinguishes them from eggs of other co-existing newt species that are smaller and darker-coloured. A genetic particularity in the genus causes 50% of the embryos to die: their development is arrested {{when they do not}} possess two different variants of chromosome 1 (i.e., when they are homozygous for that chromosome).|$|E
