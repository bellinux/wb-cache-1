5|$|Capital {{punishment}} is legal in Singapore. The number of judicial executions has fluctuated widely depending on crime rates; {{at its highest}} point, according to unofficial statistics compiled by Amnesty International, about 408 people were hanged between 1991 and 2003; <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>lowest</b> point in 2010, none were executed. Between 2004 and 2011, the number of executions varied between none and 10. Hanging, which is used for all executions and are carried out in Changi Prison on Fridays at dawn, are by the long drop method, which severs the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|Badami, also {{referred}} to as Vatapi, Vatapipura, Vatapinagari and Agastya Tirtha in historical texts, the capital of Chalukya dynasty in the 6th century, is at the exit point of a ravine between two steep mountain cliffs. Four cave temples in the escarpment of the hill to the south-east of the town were carved into the cliff's monolithic stone face. The escarpment is above a man made lake called Agastya Lake, created by an earthen dam faced with stone steps. To the west end of this cliff, <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>lowest</b> point, is the first cave temple. The largest and highest cave is Cave 3, which is further to the east on the northern face of the hill. The fourth cave, Cave 4, is a few steps down further east.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1548, the galleys {{returned}} to Scotland to scout for English ships. Knox's health was now <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>lowest</b> point {{due to the}} severity of his confinement. He was ill with a fever {{and others on the}} ship were afraid for his life. Even in this state, Knox recalled, his mind remained sharp and he comforted his fellow prisoners with hopes of release. While the ships were lying offshore between St Andrews and Dundee, the spires of the parish church where he preached appeared in view. James Balfour, a fellow prisoner, asked Knox whether he recognised the landmark. He replied that he knew it well, recognising the steeple of the place where he first preached and he declared that he would not die until he had preached there again.|$|E

5|$|The libertines {{continued}} organizing opposition, insulting {{the appointed}} ministers, and challenging {{the authority of}} the Consistory. The council straddled both sides of the conflict, alternately admonishing and upholding Calvin. When Perrin was elected first syndic in February 1552, Calvin's authority appeared to be <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>lowest</b> point. After some losses before the council, Calvin believed he was defeated; on 24 July 1553 he asked the council to allow him to resign. Although the libertines controlled the council, his request was refused. The opposition realised that they could curb Calvin's authority, but they did not have enough power to banish him.|$|E
5|$|West Creek is less {{affected}} by episodic acidification {{than most of}} the rest of the upper Fishing Creek watershed, with the exception of Coles Creek. The pH of West Creek is <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>lowest</b> in late winter and spring, when it is typically around 6.3. During the rest of the year, it is above 7.0. The entire pH range of the creek ranges from just over 6.0 to 7.2 or 7.3. The concentration of dissolved aluminum in West Creek is under 70 micrograms per liter, considerably less than the concentration needed to kill fish. The aluminum concentration is, in fact, usually approximately zero and is often under 40 micrograms per liter. However, early in 2011, the concentration was observed twice to be nearly 60 micrograms per liter.|$|E
5|$|Gallipoli {{marked the}} end for Hamilton and Stopford but Hunter-Weston went on to lead VIII Corps {{on the first day}} of the Battle of the Somme. The {{competence}} of Australian brigade commanders, John Monash (4th Infantry Brigade) and Harry Chauvel (1st Light Horse Brigade, New Zealand and Australian Division), was recognised by promotion to divisional and corps command. The influence of Kitchener waned after the coalition government was formed in May 1915, partly because of the growing sense of failure in the Dardanelles and culminated in Kitchener being over-ruled on support for the French at Salonika in early December 1915, when his influence on the Cabinet was <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>lowest.</b> The campaign gave confidence to the Ottomans in their ability to defeat the Allies. In Mesopotamia, the Turks surrounded a British expedition at Kut Al Amara, forcing their surrender in April 1916. Ottoman forces in southern Palestine were poised to launch an attack against the Suez Canal and Egypt. Defeat at the Battle of Romani and lack of materials to complete the military railway, necessary for such an operation, {{marked the end}} of that ambition. The optimism which came from the victory at Gallipoli was replaced by a gathering sense of despair and the British remained on the offensive in the Middle East for the rest of the war.|$|E

5|$|The chicks {{take from}} 34 to 50 days to fledge, the period {{depending}} on the abundance of their food supply. In years of fish shortage, the whole colony may experience a longer fledgling period but the normal range is 38 to 44 days, by which time chicks will have reached about 75% of their mature body weight. The chick may come to the burrow entrance to defecate but does not usually emerge into the open and seems to have an aversion to light until it is nearly fully fledged. Although the supply of fish by the adults reduces {{over the last few}} days spent in the nest, the chick is not abandoned as happens in the Manx shearwater. On occasions, an adult has been observed provisioning a nest even after the chick has departed. During the last few days underground, the chick sheds its down and the juvenile plumage is revealed. Its relatively small beak and its legs and feet are a dark colour and it lacks the white facial patches of the adult. The chick finally leaves its nest at night, when the risk of predation is <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>lowest.</b> When the moment arrives, it emerges from the burrow, usually for the first time, and walks, runs and flaps its way to the sea. It cannot fly properly yet so descending a cliff is perilous; when it reaches the water it paddles out to sea, and may be three kilometres (two miles) away from the shore by daybreak. It does not congregate with others of its kind and will not return to land for two or three years.|$|E
5|$|The {{resident}} supercargo {{was responsible}} for buying goods such as tea, porcelain, silk, arrack, sago and miscellaneous for the next ship arriving from Sweden. The SOIC traded mainly with the Chinese merchant Puankhequa, who had his factory next to the Swedish, and judging from their letters, Puankhequa and Grill became friends. Grill was entrusted with funds from the SOIC for buying tea and other goods during off-season when the price was <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>lowest.</b> He bought most of the tea from Puankhequa, and several contracts are preserved. However, he did not buy the tea from the Chinese merchant on the SOIC's behalf but instead bought it through his own company and sold {{it on to the}} SOIC at a slightly higher price. After some time the SOIC became suspicious and director David Sandberg was sent to Canton to investigate the matter in 1766. Grill and his companions, Grubb and Hahr, had to sign an agreement not to misuse their position within the SOIC. In 1768, Grill was ordered to return home as supercargo on the ship Cron Prins Gustaf. Even so, Hahr stayed behind in Canton, continued their business and was able to transfer Grill's share of the profit through international bank notes.|$|E
