5000|$|Aerostats are {{so named}} because they use [...] "aerostatic" [...] lift, a buoyant force that does not require lateral {{movement}} through the surrounding air mass to effect a lifting force. By contrast, <b>aerodynes</b> primarily use aerodynamic lift, which requires the lateral movement of at least {{some part of the}} aircraft through the surrounding air mass.|$|R
5000|$|In BEAM robotics, a flier is an aero-robot that {{functions}} in an atmospheric environment. They possess a driven mode of locomotion through and/or {{supported by the}} atmosphere. Fliers include various designs, but usually lie within a device class that can be delineated as aircraft, which includes any vehicle designed {{to move through the}} air (<b>aerodynes</b> or aerostats).|$|R
5000|$|When the Swedish Aeronautical Society (Svenska Aeronautiska Sällskapet, SAS) was {{established}} in Stockholm on 15 December 1900, there were only one predecessor in the world, the Aéro-Club de France. The purpose of the society was [...] "to its ability encourage the art of ballooning in Sweden in all its branches", and the first years until about 1910 was mostly about aerostats (balloons) and was later transformed into <b>aerodynes</b> (aircraft).|$|R
50|$|The Progressive <b>Aerodyne</b> Stingray is an American homebuilt {{flying boat}} that was {{designed}} by and produced by Progressive <b>Aerodyne</b> of Orlando, Florida, introduced in the 1990s. When it was available the aircraft was supplied as a kit for amateur construction.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Aerodyne</b> Systems Vector is {{a family}} of American {{ultralight}} aircraft that was designed by Berndt Petterson, Mike McCarron and Paul Yarnell and produced by <b>Aerodyne</b> Systems, introduced in 1982. The aircraft was supplied as a kit for amateur construction.|$|E
50|$|While {{headquartered}} in France, <b>Aerodyne</b> Technologies had its gliders constructed {{in a newly}} built factory in Mauritius. The company constructed a full line of gliders, from the beginner <b>Aerodyne</b> Yogi to the high-performance Shaman and the two-place Totem Bi for flight training.|$|E
50|$|Aerostats are {{so named}} because they use aerostatic lift which is a buoyant force that does not require {{movement}} through the surrounding air mass. This contrasts with the heavy <b>aerodynes</b> that primarily use aerodynamic lift which requires the movement of a wing surface through the surrounding air mass. The term has also been used in a narrower sense, {{to refer to the}} statically tethered balloon in contrast to the free-flying airship. This article uses the term in its broader sense.|$|R
50|$|His {{career in}} the field of MHD is well-known: first method of {{electrothermal}} instability control and first usable MHD generator with non-equilibrium ionized gas (1967); kinetic theory of non-equilibrium plasmas (1972); MHD <b>aerodynes</b> with ionization control (1975); Shock wave cancellation by MHD force field around a cylindrical profile imbedded in a liquid flow (1983); 2nd method of electrothermal instability control by magnetic pressure gradient in an MHD accelerator (1981); Thesis director about shock wave annihilation around a flat wing in a hot supersonic gas flow: Resolution of Navier-Stokes equations within an MHD force field by the method of characteristics (1987).|$|R
50|$|There {{are a few}} {{different}} {{variations of}} the 3-ring system. The original 3-ring release from the late 1970s {{is now known as}} large 3-rings. A version using smaller rings (mini rings) was introduced in the 1980s. The reasons {{for the development of the}} mini ring system and the associated smaller risers were mostly aesthetic; the mini rings do not increase safety but actually reduce the mechanical advantage inherent in the system thereby increasing the pull force a jumper must apply to cut-away. Tandem systems still use rings that are even larger than the original rings, and some tandem rigs even use four rings (e.g., Advance Tandem by Basik). Other variations have placed the rings under the risers facing back instead of forward of the risers facing front or varied the geometry of the rings for example using an elongated middle ring for a claimed improvement in mechanical advantage on <b>Aerodyne's</b> miniforce system.|$|R

40|$|During the Atlanta Supersite Project, four {{particle}} mass spectrometers were operated {{together for}} the first time: NOAA's Particle Analysis by Laser Mass Spectrometer (PALMS), University of California at Riverside's Aerosol Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (ATOFMS), University of Delaware's Rapid Single-Particle Mass Spectrometer II (RSMS-II), and <b>Aerodyne's</b> Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS). Although these mass spectrometers are generally classified as similar instruments, they clearly have different characteristics due to their unique designs. One primary difference is related to the volatilization/ionization method: PALMS, ATOFMS, and RSMS-II utilize laser desorption/ionization, whereas particles in the AMS instrument are volatilized by impaction onto a heated surface with the resulting components ionized by electron impact. Thus mass spectral data from the AMS are representative of the ensemble of particles sampled, and those from the laser-based instruments are representative of individual particles. In addition, the AMS instrument cannot analyze refractory material such as soot, sodium chloride, and crustal elements, and some sulfate or water-rich particles may not always be analyzed with every laser-based instrument. A main difference among the laser-based mass spectrometers is that the RSMS-II instrument can obtain size-resolved single particle composition information for particles with aerodynamic diameters as small as 15 nm. The minimum sizes analyzed by ATOFMS and PALMS are 0. 2 and about 0. 35 μm, respectively, in aerodynamic diameter. Furthermore, PALMS, ATOFMS, and RSMS-II use different laser ionization conditions. Despite these differences the laser-based instruments found similar individual particle classifications, and their relative fractions among comparable sized particles from Atlanta were broadly consistent. Finally, the AMS measurements of the nitrate/sulfate mole ratio were highly correlated with composite measurements (r^ 2 = 0. 93). In contrast, the PALMS nitrate/sulfate ion ratios were only moderately correlated (r^ 2 ∼ 0. 7) ...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Aerodyne</b> Jazz Bass {{is usually}} {{equipped}} with a split single-coil 'p-bass' pickup at the mid position and a single-coil pickup from a Jazz Bass at the bridge position. A number of Japanese domestic market 'non-export' models also come in a standard Jazz Bass' configuration. The bass is fitted with one volume knob per pickup, plus a master tone knob. The body outline is shaped like the Jazz Bass, though substantially lighter (the <b>Aerodyne</b> Jazz Bass weighs about 7 pounds, compared to the 10 pounds of the standard Jazz Bass). It's also slightly thinner than a traditional Jazz Bass body, due to its unusual 39 inch top radius unique to the <b>Aerodyne</b> series. The radius of the top means that the bridge is actually inset slightly {{into the top of}} the body. The <b>Aerodyne</b> Jazz Bass has a standard 1.5 inch nut width, a very slim [...] "C" [...] shaped neck and 20 medium jumbo frets.|$|E

50|$|The {{principle}} {{behind the}} <b>Aerodyne</b> {{is the combination}} of lift and thrust production in a single construction unit and flow channel, i.e. a ducted fan. Flaps {{at the end of}} the fan divert the outflowing air to produce lift, thrust, or a combination of both. As a result, the <b>Aerodyne</b> could be steered and flown in the entire range between hovering and full-forward flight.|$|E
