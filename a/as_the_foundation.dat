5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this theory <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E

5|$|The title marked Codemasters' {{debut in}} {{developing}} a mobile game internally. The goal {{of the project was}} to create a core, rally racing experience for mobile devices. The development team chose to use Colin McRae Rally 2.0 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation,</b> taking its tracks, driving model, and pacenotes for the new title. Original vehicle models were reused however aspects of the game's graphics were enhanced to provide the higher visual quality expected by modern standards.

Natural selection is here understood to act on embryonic development to change the morphology of the adult body.|$|E

She became head of the Jakarta Art Board in 2003; two years later she was approached by UNICEF and asked to write a drama to raise awareness of child trafficking in Southeast Asia.

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the U.S. was {{planning}} its own actions against bin Laden. Michael Scheuer, {{chief of the}} CIA's bin Laden unit (Alec Station), considered using local Afghans to kidnap bin Laden, then exfiltrate him from Afghanistan in a modified Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Documents recovered from Wadih el-Hage's Nairobi computer suggested a link between bin Laden and the deaths of U.S. troops in Somalia. These were used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> for the June 1998 New York indictment of bin Laden, although the charges were later dropped. The planned raid was cancelled in May after internecine disputes between officials at the FBI and the CIA; the hesitation of the National Security Council (NSC) to approve the plan; concerns over the raid's chance of success, {{and the potential for}} civilian casualties.|$|E
5|$|Favret {{points out}} that Wollstonecraft's Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is quite {{different}} from the despondent and plaintive love letters she actually sent to Imlay; the travel narrative much more closely resembles the personal journal in which she recorded her thoughts regarding the people she encountered and the places she visited. While her letters to Imlay contain long passages focused almost exclusively on herself, the Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark offers social commentary and sympathizes with the victims of disaster and injustice. To Imlay, Wollstonecraft represents herself as laid low by doubts, but to the world she depicts herself as overcoming all of these fears. She ruminates on them and transforms them into the basis of a letter akin to the open political letter popular during the last quarter of the eighteenth century, using her personal experience <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> for a discussion of national political reform.|$|E
5|$|Further reviews came in {{this time}} as Defence {{planners}} attempted {{to grapple with the}} questions regarding strategy following the wars of diplomacy of the previous three decades. The emergence of the Defence of Australia doctrine <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> upon which Australian defence policy would be based following Paul Dibb's 1986 review of Australia's defence capabilities seemed to provide the Reserves with a definite role. Nevertheless, there remained a reluctance to rebuild the Reserves and despite these major reviews, as late as the 1990s the Army still had not managed to develop a well-structured reserve force, as it had continued to grapple with the competing demands of maintaining large-scale general readiness over developing a 'hard core' of capability within the Reserves that would be able to provide the Army with a nucleus force in times of national emergency.|$|E

5|$|The house {{expanded}} in several phases. In 1861, before the Del Valle family moved here permanently, they added three additional rooms {{as well as}} a free-standing cocina (kitchen). This was to keep fire away from the main building, as well as to keep it cooler. A basement was dug out <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> of the new rooms. In the 1870s, another wing was added perpendicular to the 1861 addition. Finally, some time after 1895, one more room was added to the new wing, {{as well as a}} breezeway to the kitchen, completing the current shape. Remodeling completed after this time was to the interior only.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{marriage}} in the Bahá'i faith is mainly to foster spiritual harmony, fellowship and unity {{between a man and}} a woman and to provide a stable and loving environment for the rearing of children. The Bahá'í teachings on marriage call it a fortress for well-being and salvation and place marriage and the family <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> of the structure of human society. Bahá'u'lláh highly praised marriage, discouraged divorce, and required chastity outside of marriage; Bahá'u'lláh taught that a husband and wife should strive to improve the spiritual life of each other. Interracial marriage is also highly praised throughout Bahá'í scripture.|$|E

There are also classic mare lines, with up to 35 recognized by various breed registries. The majority of horses are registered through the member organizations of the Lipizzan International Federation, which covers almost 11,000 horses in 19 countries and at 9 state studs in Europe. The majority of Lipizzans reside in Europe, with smaller numbers in the Americas, Africa and Australia. Generally gray in color, the Lipizzan is a muscular breed that matures slowly and is long-lived.|$|E

5|$|Colin McRae Rally was {{developed}} by Codemasters' Southam-based development studio. It was the company's first internally developed mobile game, and lead off an initiative to produce games for new and existing intellectual property specifically for mobile devices. The development team was composed of staff who had worked on early Colin McRae Rally games and more recent Codemasters racing games. The game was initially designed for iOS mobile devices using Colin McRae Rally 2.0 as a basis. This early iteration of their Rally series was chosen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> because it presented a focused rally racing experience, whereas later entries expanded to offer more gimmicks and game modes. Thirty stages from Rally 2.0 were faithfully reproduced; the team ensured that the position of every corner, obstacle, and surface transition matched the original rallies. While existing content and assets were reused, they also chose {{to take advantage of}} modern technology while creating Colin McRae Rally. The game was built using the Unity game engine and written in the C# programming language, closely referencing the original C source code to make certain that the handling and physics systems replicate Rally 2.0.|$|E
5|$|Early historians, {{including}} the 6th century cleric Gildas, have noted 383 {{as a significant}} point in Welsh history, as it is stated in literature <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> point of several medieval royal dynasties. In that year the Roman general Magnus Maximus, or Macsen Wledig, stripped all of western and northern Britain of troops and senior administrators, to launch a successful bid for imperial power; continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor. Gildas, writing in about 540, says that Maximus departed Britain, taking with him all of its Roman troops, armed bands, governors and the flower of its youth, never to return. Having left with the troops and Roman administrators, and planning to continue as the ruler of Britain in the future, his practical course was to transfer local authority to local rulers. The earliest Welsh genealogies give Maximus the role of founding father for several royal dynasties, including those of Powys and Gwent. It was this transfer of power that {{has given rise to}} the belief that he was the father of the Welsh Nation. He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg, erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales.|$|E
5|$|He {{managed to}} regain a {{starting}} {{spot on the}} Bears' roster, after Barry Minter, the team's veteran middle linebacker, was forced to miss the Week 3 game on account of an injury. Urlacher excelled at the middle linebacker position, and recorded 46 tackles, six sacks, and one interception in his next five starts. Not even a rib cage injury hindered his performance during this period, as Urlacher {{went on to win}} the league's Rookie Defensive Player of the Month in October. He led the Bears with 124 tackles and eight sacks, both of which surpassed the franchise's previous rookie records. Although the Bears finished with a disappointing 5–11 record, Urlacher received a number of individual accolades for his performance during the season. Many news organizations, such as the Associated Press and The Sporting News named him as the 2000 Defensive Rookie of the Year. Football fans across the nation also voted Urlacher to play at the 2001 Pro Bowl as an alternate middle linebacker. Urlacher's successful rookie campaign served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> for his professional career and reputation.|$|E
