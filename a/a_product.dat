40|$|Approved {{innovator}} {{products and}} their noninnovator ‘‘copy’’ versions {{are likely to}} vary in their quality, eg, physicochemical characteristics and biological activity, with important implications for clinical efficacy and safety. Therefore, {{it is important to}} study and thoroughly evaluate the noninnovator products in comparison with approved products at the preclinical and clinical stages. We have obtained 4 noninnovator interferon (IFN) - b- 1 <b>a</b> <b>products</b> currently marketed in Latin America and Iran and compared these with approved IFN-b- 1 <b>a</b> <b>products</b> (Avonex and Rebif) obtained from the same geographical regions with respect to biological potency, estimated by in vitro bioassays, and molecular characteristics, assessed by immunoblotting and high-performance liquid chromatography. In this article, we present our data showing that the noninnovator IFN-b- 1 <b>a</b> <b>products</b> can vary considerably in their biological potency. In addition, we showed that all IFN-b- 1 <b>a</b> <b>products</b> formulated with human serum albumin contained variable amounts of higher-molecular-weight aggregates of IFN-b- 1 a and adducts with human serum albumin, these being more prevalent in 2 noninnovator IFN-b- 1 <b>a</b> <b>products</b> where biological potency was reduced compared with approved IFN-b- 1 <b>a</b> <b>products.</b> Additionally, significant lot-to-lot variability was observed for one of the noninnovator products. Taken together, {{the results of this study}} highlight the need for not only thorough in vitro characterization, but also preclinical and clinical assessment to ensure patient safety and efficacy...|$|R

5|$|The LU {{decomposition}} factors matrices as <b>a</b> <b>product</b> {{of lower}} (L) and an upper triangular matrices (U). Once this decomposition is calculated, linear {{systems can be}} solved more efficiently, by a simple technique called forward and back substitution. Likewise, inverses of triangular matrices are algorithmically easier to calculate. The Gaussian elimination is a similar algorithm; it transforms any matrix to row echelon form. Both methods proceed by multiplying the matrix by suitable elementary matrices, which correspond to permuting rows or columns and adding multiples of one row to another row. Singular value decomposition expresses any matrix A as <b>a</b> <b>product</b> UDV∗, where U and V are unitary matrices and D is a diagonal matrix.|$|E
