5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Jonas & François and released on 13 March 2013. Inspired by several films, it features <b>Azalea</b> performing twerking sequences and a recreation of Vanessa Ferlito's lap dancing in the 2007 film, Death Proof. The video earned <b>Azalea</b> a nomination for Artist to Watch at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, and was praised by critics for its fashion, and portrayal of the song's lyrics. Among her live performance staples, <b>Azalea</b> promoted the single with live renditions on Britain & Ireland's Next Top Model and Nikki & Sara Live.

5|$|<b>Azalea</b> also envisioned an Eastern {{theme for}} the music video because of the song's Eastern music {{influences}} and her interest in Bollywood films. BRTHR wrote a Hindu wedding scenario for the video, with <b>Azalea</b> as the bride. At Azalea's request, the video was filmed in Mumbai's streets and slums, and on Bollywood sets. Because of the increased cost of filming on location, <b>Azalea</b> decided to personally contribute to the video's budget. T.I. was scheduled {{to appear in the}} music video, but was unable due to visa delays. Azalea's stylist, Alejandra Hernandez, coordinated the rapper's wardrobe, inspired by Bollywood disco era and Indian actress Parveen Babi. Hernandez used bold-coloured saris in the video; she prepared Azalea's wardrobe in Los Angeles, and her creations were made in London and Mumbai. Azalea's jewelry was also purchased in Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|The video {{returns to}} the Bollywood set, where <b>Azalea</b> dances at the wedding and before a moving {{backdrop}} with occasional slow-motion sequences. In a white sari with a golden crown, she performs (surrounded by children) at a Holi celebration. After a series of jump cuts, the video ends with <b>Azalea</b> driving off on a motorcycle under a shower of flower petals.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{then returns}} to the trailer park setting, where <b>Azalea</b> rides a lowrider bicycle through the area. She wears a {{perforated}} yellow visor, black brassiere, spiked yellow Louboutins and ethnic slim-fit pants. The video then enters a new scene where <b>Azalea</b> arrives at a dive bar and switches a jukebox on. At the bar, Azalea's two friends from the Freightliner Truck scene are seated at a table, and a long-haired man wearing dark sunglasses awaits her on {{a chair in the}} centre of building. <b>Azalea,</b> dressed in a palm tree bikini and yellow neon shorts, performs a lap dance for the man. She then steals his car keys and runs off with her friends, who drive the man's convertible out into the desert. <b>Azalea</b> is seen standing in the car, waving a thin piece of material in the wind. They drive through a day and night period before arriving in Hollywood in the morning. Azalea's friends then drop her off at a sidewalk, where the video ends with her walking in the city. She wears dark sunglasses, striped black-and-white shorts and a custom-made dalmatian-print blazer in the final scene.|$|E
50|$|North American <b>azaleas</b> are {{flowering}} shrubs in {{the genus}} Rhododendron, section Pentanthera, subsection Pentanthera, {{so named because}} they all have five stamens. Most are in the United States, with one species found in Canada and one being found in Mexico. North American <b>azaleas</b> are commonly confused with <b>azaleas</b> of Asian origin, the evergreen <b>azaleas.</b> North American <b>azaleas</b> are deciduous and produce two types of buds. One is a larger and produces about 20 flowers while the other bud produces a leafy shoot. The flower color, fragrance, and number of stamens vary among species.|$|R

40|$|Twenty-three diploids, six triploids, nine tetraploids {{and four}} mixoploids in {{evergreen}} <b>azaleas</b> and eight diploids and five tetraploids in deciduous <b>azaleas</b> {{were identified by}} flow cytometric analysis of ploidy in species, interspecific hybrids and culticars. Sizes of guard cells and pollen grains tended to increase {{in proportion to the}} increase in the ploidy. Intrasubgeneric and intra- or interploid hybridizations were conducted with evergreen and deciduoud <b>azaleas.</b> Tetraploids of evergreen <b>azaleas</b> had relatively high crossability as seed and/or pollen parents, and triploid evergreen <b>azaleas</b> had fertility as seed parents only.

5|$|Thomas Meehan & Sons of Philadelphia {{designed}} the English Garden in 1910. It was first {{known as the}} Wisteria Garden. In 1925, Ninah attended a lecture on azaleas given by H. Harold Hume, a horticulturist known for his work with azaleas, camellias, and citrus. This lecture sparked her interest in azaleas, so she visited <b>azalea</b> gardens in Charleston, South Carolina for inspiration. Advised by Hume, she replanted much of her English garden with them, renaming it the <b>Azalea</b> Garden.|$|E

40|$|For the {{reduction}} of several undesirable traits, such as deciduousness and weak heat tolerance, of intersubgeneric hybrids between interspecific F 1 hybrids of evergreen <b>azaleas</b> and a deciduous species (Rhododendron japonicum f. flavum), back cross with evergreen <b>azaleas</b> was conducted. Though pollen of the intersubgeneric hybrids was highly sterile, fertility was restored in a tetraploid plant (9027 - 5). Unilateral cross incompatibility was observed between the intersubgeneric tetraploid hybrid 9027 - 5 and evergreen <b>azaleas,</b> i. e., progenies obtained only in the cross with the tetraploid plant 9027 - 5 used as a pollen parent.

5|$|Meier has {{exploited}} the two naturally-occurring ridges (which diverge at a 22.5 degree angle) by overlaying two grids along these axes. These grids serve {{to define the}} space of the campus while dividing the import of the buildings on it. Along one axis lie the galleries and along the other axis lie the administrative buildings. Meier emphasized the two competing grids by constructing strong view lines through the campus. The main north-south axis starts with the helipad, then includes a narrow walkway between the auditorium and north buildings, continues past the elevator kiosk to the tram station, through the rotunda, past the walls and support columns of the exhibitions pavilion, and finally the ramp besides the west pavilion and the central garden. Its corresponding east-west visual axis starts with the edge of the scholar's wing of the Getty Research Institute (GRI), the walkway between the central garden and the GRI, the overlook to the <b>azalea</b> pool in the central garden, the walkway between the central garden and the west pavilion, and finally the north wall of the west pavilion and the courtyard between the south and east pavilions.|$|E
5|$|Mobile {{has more}} than 45 public parks within its limits, with some that are of special note. Bienville Square is a {{historic}} park in the Lower Dauphin Street Historic District.

5|$|With the {{ambition}} to become London's sole burial site in perpetuity, the LNC {{were aware that}} if their plans were successful, their Necropolis would become a site of major national importance. As a consequence, the cemetery was designed with attractiveness in mind, {{in contrast to the}} squalid and congested London burial grounds and the newer suburban cemeteries which were already becoming crowded. The LNC aimed to create an atmosphere of perpetual spring in the cemetery, and chose the plants for the cemetery accordingly. It had already been noted that evergreen plants from North America thrived in the local soil. Robert Donald, the owner of an arboretum near Woking, was contracted to supply the trees and shrubs for the cemetery. The railway line through the cemetery and the major roads and paths within the cemetery were lined with giant sequoia trees, the first significant planting of these trees (only introduced to Europe in 1853) in Britain. As well as the giant sequoias, the grounds were heavily planted with magnolia, rhododendron, coastal redwood, <b>azalea,</b> andromeda and monkeypuzzle, with the intention of creating perpetual greenery with large numbers of flowers and a strong floral scent throughout the cemetery.|$|E
