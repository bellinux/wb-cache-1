40|$|Within a mean-field approximation, {{the ground}} state and finite {{temperature}} phase diagrams of the two-dimensional Kondo lattice model have been carefully studied as {{functions of the}} Kondo coupling $J$ and the conduction electron concentration $n_{c}$. In addition to the conventional hybridization between local moments and itinerant electrons, a staggered hybridization is proposed to characterize the interplay between the antiferromagnetism and the Kondo screening effect. As a result, a heavy fermion <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>phase</b> is obtained and separated from the pure antiferromagnetic ordered phase by a first-order Lifshitz phase transition, while a continuous phase transition exists between the heavy fermion <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>phase</b> and the Kondo paramagnetic phase. We have developed a efficient theory to calculate these phase boundaries. As $n_{c}$ decreases from the half-filling, {{the region of the}} heavy fermion <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>phase</b> shrinks and finally disappears at a critical point $n_{c}^{*}= 0. 8228 $, leaving a first-order critical line between the pure <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>phase</b> and the Kondo paramagnetic phase for $n_{c}<n_{c}^{* }$. At half-filling limit, a finite temperature phase diagram is also determined on the Kondo coupling and temperature ($J$-$T$) plane. Notably, as the temperature is increased, the region of the heavy fermion <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>phase</b> is reduced continuously, and finally converges to a single point, together with the pure <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>phase</b> and the Kondo paramagnetic phase. The phase diagrams with such triple point may account for the observed phase transitions in related heavy fermion materials. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

40|$|In this research, {{the phase}} {{behavior}} of a lattice-based model for a classical two dimensional dipolar antiferromagnet on a square lattice is determined using Monte Carlo simulations. Four different systems are investigated, with the magnetic phase diagram for each system being established for both zero and finite temperature. The results are compared to earlier theoretical and experimental results on low dimensional magnetic systems. [...] The first model is the Heisenberg {{system in which the}} three-dimensional classical spins interact through both nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange and long-range dipolar interactions. The magnetic phase diagram for this system was determined as a function of both T/g and |J|/g, where T is the temperature in units of 1 /κβ such that κβ is the Boltzmann constant, J is the strength of the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, and g is the strength of the dipolar interaction. At low temperatures, this phase diagram shows a dipolar planar <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>phase</b> for low values of |J|/g, and a simple perpendicular <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>phase</b> for large values of |J|/g. The reorientation transition value of the exchange interaction, J r (T), on the phase boundary separating these two ordered phases, shows only a weak dependence on temperature. The data also indicate that the dipolar planar <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>phase</b> separates into two distinct phases in which the orientation of the spins depends on the value of the |J|/g. [...] The second model is the plane rotator system in which the two-dimensional classical spin rotors are confined to the plane of the system and interact through both nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange and long-range dipolar interactions. The phase diagram of this system was constructed as a function of both T/g and |J|/g. The results for the plane rotator system are compared to the results obtained for the Heisenberg system. This comparison clarifies the role played by the out-of-plane degree of freedom of spins in determining the structure of the dipolar planar <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>phase.</b> [...] The third model is the anisotropic Heisenberg system with fixed κ (where κ is the strength of the planar magnetic surface anisotropy). In this system, the three dimensional classical spins interact through nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange and long-range dipolar interactions, as well as by a weak planar magnetic surface anisotropy (i. e., κ = — 1. 0 g). Again, the magnetic phase diagram for this system was determined as a function of both T/g and |J|/g. This phase diagram shows similar behavior to that of the Heisenberg system, except that there exists a range of |J|/g in which the system exhibits a reorientation transition from the dipolar planar <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>phase</b> to the simple perpendicular <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>phase</b> with increasing temperature. [...] Finally, the fourth model is the anisotropic Heisenberg system with fixed J. In this system, the three-dimensional classical spins interact through a short-range antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, a planar magnetic surface anisotropy and a long-range dipolar interaction. The simulations focus on the exchange-dominated regime in which the strength of the exchange interaction is significantly greater than both the dipolar interaction and the magnetic surface anisotropy. The magnetic phase diagram for this system was then established as a function of both T/g and |κ|/g, for a fixed value of the exchange constant (i. e., J = — 10. 0 g). This phase diagram shows that there exists a range of the |κ|/g in which the system exhibits a reorientation transition from the simple planar <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>phase</b> to the simple perpendicular <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>phase</b> with increasing temperature.
