5|$|In nuclear polyadenylation, a poly(A) tail {{is added}} to an RNA {{at the end of}} transcription. On mRNAs, the poly(A) tail protects the mRNA {{molecule}} from enzymatic degradation in the cytoplasm <b>and</b> <b>aids</b> in transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation. Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs are polyadenylated, with the exception of animal replication-dependent histone mRNAs. These are the only mRNAs in eukaryotes that lack a poly(A) tail, ending instead in a stem-loop structure followed by a purine-rich sequence, termed histone downstream element, that directs where the RNA is cut so that the 3' end of the histone mRNA is formed.|$|E
