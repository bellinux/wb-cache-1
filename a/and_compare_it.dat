5|$|Attempts to {{reconstruct}} the uncut version of Greed without use of the lost footage first began in 1958. At the Brussels International Exposition, the Cinémathèque royale de Belgique named Greed {{as one of the}} twelve greatest films ever made and simultaneously published von Stroheim's original, uncut script for Greed, which came directly from von Stroheim's personal copy preserved by his widow Denise Vernac. This publication led to three separate books that all used von Stroheim's script in order {{to reconstruct}} the original version of the film <b>and</b> <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> to the released version: a French book edited by Jacques-G. Perret in 1968 and two versions edited by Joel Finler and Herman G. Weinberg, both in 1972. Weinberg's book utilized 400 individual stills and production photos {{to reconstruct the}} uncut version of Greed, the first time that images from the uncut version were publicly available.|$|E

500|$|Prior to September 2005, {{comparative}} bullet-lead {{analysis was}} performed on bullets found at a scene that were too destroyed for striation comparison. The technique would attempt to determine the unique elemental breakdown of the bullet <b>and</b> <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> to seized bullets possessed by a suspect. Review of the method found that the breakdown of elements found in bullets could be significantly different enough to potentially allow for two bullets from separate sources to be correlated to each other. However, {{there is not enough}} differences to definitely match a bullet from a crime scene to one taken from a suspect's possession. An additional report in 2004 from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) found that the testimony given regarding comparative bullet-lead analysis was overstated and potentially [...] "misleading under the federal rules of evidence". In 2005, the Federal Bureau of Investigation indicated that they would no longer be performing this type of analysis.|$|E

2500|$|A {{common problem}} {{is to find the}} Euler angles of a given frame. The fastest way to get them is to write the three given vectors as columns of a matrix <b>and</b> <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> with the {{expression}} of the theoretical matrix (see later table of matrices). Hence the three Euler Angles can be calculated. Nevertheless, the same result can be reached avoiding matrix algebra and using only elemental geometry. Here we present the results for the two most commonly used conventions: ZXZ for proper Euler angles and ZYX for Tait-Bryan. Notice that any other convention can be obtained just changing [...] the name of the axes.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{correlation}} {{measures are}} sensitive to the manner in which X and Y are sampled. [...] Dependencies tend to be stronger if viewed over a wider range of values. Thus, if we consider the correlation coefficient between the heights of fathers and their sons over all adult males, <b>and</b> <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> to the same correlation coefficient calculated when the fathers are selected to be between 165cm and 170cm in height, the correlation will be weaker in the latter case. Several techniques have been developed that attempt to correct for range restriction in one or both variables, and are commonly used in meta-analysis; the most common are Thorndike's case II and case III equations.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is also a}} second, {{informal}} layout in {{widespread use}} — the so-called [...] "phonetic" [...] layout, in which Cyrillic letters are mapped to the QWERTY keys for Latin letters that [...] "sound" [...] or [...] "look" [...] the same, with several exceptions (Я is mapped to Q, Ж is mapped to V, etc. — see [...] <b>and</b> <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> to the standard QWERTY layout). This layout is available {{as an alternative to}} the BDS one in some operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X and Ubuntu Linux. Normally, the layouts are set up so that the user can switch between Latin and Cyrillic script by pressing Shift + Alt, and between BDS and Phonetic by pressing Shift + Ctrl.|$|E
2500|$|His first {{objection}} {{is that we}} have {{no experience}} of world-making. Hume highlighted the fact that everything we claim to know the cause of, we have derived the inductions from previous experiences of similar objects being created or seen the object itself being created ourselves. For example, with a watch, we know it has to be created by a watch-maker because we can observe it being made <b>and</b> <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> to the making of other similar watches or objects to deduce they have alike causes in their creation. However, he argues that we have no experience of the universe's creation or any other universe's creations to compare our own universe to and never will; therefore, it would be illogical to infer that our universe has been created by an intelligent designer in the same way [...] that a watch has.|$|E

2500|$|Another way to {{calculate}} the risk dominant equilibrium is {{to calculate}} the risk factor for all equilibria and to find the equilibrium with the smallest risk factor. [...] To calculate the risk factor in our 2x2 game, consider [...] the expected payoff to a player if they play H: [...] (where p is {{the probability that the}} other player will play H), <b>and</b> <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> to the expected payoff if they play G: [...] [...] The value of p which makes these two expected values equal is the risk factor for the equilibrium (H,H), with [...] the risk factor for playing (G,G). [...] You can also calculate the risk factor for playing (G,G) by doing the same calculation, but setting p as the probability the other player will play G. [...] An interpretation for p is it is the smallest probability that the opponent must play that strategy such that the person's own payoff from copying the opponent's strategy is greater than if the other strategy was played.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers Jeonghye Choi of Yonsei University, Sam Hui of Stern School of Business at New York University and David Bell of The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, {{explored}} two imitation {{effects of}} the demand at an Internet retailer, geographic proximity and demographic similarity and concluded that firms can influence the space–time demand path through seeding. The researchers conceived a new seeding strategy called “Proximity-and-similarity-based strategy”, in which the firm seeds the new product by choosing new zip codes that are the most responsive while adjusting the impact of proximity and similarity effects over time, <b>and</b> <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> to the three strategies presented in Libai, Muller and Peres's research,“support the strong”, “support the weak” and “uniform”. [...] They argue that with time, the “proximity-and similarity-based strategy” performs best because the similarity effect begins to affect new and distant areas. Namely, serving many small pools of similar buyers demographically, who are geographically distant from one another, is crucial for an Internet retailer because then sales increase over time.|$|E
2500|$|Rivers's {{first task}} was to examine first hand the colour vision of the islanders <b>and</b> <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> to that of Europeans. In {{the course of his}} {{examinations}} of the visual acuity of the natives, Rivers showed that colour-blindness did not exist or was very rare, but that the colour vision of Papuans was not the same type as that of Europeans; they possessed no word for blue, and an intelligent native found nothing unnatural in applying the same name to the brilliant blue sea or sky and to the deepest black. [...] "Moreover," [...] Head goes on to state in Rivers's obituary notice, [...] "he was able to explode to old fallacy that the 'noble savage' was endowed with powers of vision far exceeding that of civilised natives. Errors of refraction are, it is true, less common, especially myopia. But, altogether the feats of the Torres Straits islanders equalled those reported by travellers {{from other parts of the}} world, they were due to the power of attending to minute details in familiar and strictly limited surrounding, and not to supernormal visual acuity." ...|$|E
