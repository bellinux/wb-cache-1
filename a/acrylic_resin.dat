5|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{physical}} restoration was to re-attach any areas of the plaster surface (which was approximately 5mm thick) that {{were in danger of}} separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a polyvinylacetate resin. Earlier bronze braces that had been used to stabilise surfaces were removed in those places where they were causing cracking, and the holes filled. Pigments that appeared to be not well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin.</b>|$|E

25|$|B-72 is a {{thermoplastic}} resin {{that was created}} by Rohm and Haas {{for use as a}} surface coating and as a vehicle for Flexographic ink. However B-72 is now being used more as an adhesive specifically for ceramic and glass. One of the major advantages of B-72 as a consolidate is that it is stronger and harder than polyvinyl acetate without being extremely brittle. This adhesive is more flexible than many of the other typically-used adhesives and tolerates stress and strain on a join that most others can not. One major drawback to using B-72 is the difficulty of applying the <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> as an adhesive, as is difficulty in manipulating the substance as a workable agent.

25|$|Magna, {{a special}} artist use acrylic paint was {{developed}} by Leonard Bocour and Sam Golden in 1947 and reformulated in 1960, specifically for Morris Louis and other stain painters of the color field movement. In Magna pigments are ground in an <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> with alcohol-based solvents. Unlike modern water-based acrylics, Magna is miscible with turpentine or mineral spirits and dries rapidly to a matte or glossy finish. It was used extensively by Morris Louis, and Friedel Dzubas and also by Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein. Magna colors are more vivid and intense than regular acrylic water-based paints. Louis used Magna to great effect in his Stripe Series, where the colors are used undiluted and are poured unmixed directly from the can.|$|E

Methods: Ten acrylic resin-based materials were evaluated: two heat cure <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins</b> (De Trey QC- 20, Meliodent Heat Cure) and eight self cure <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins</b> (Meliodent Cold, Akrileks, Akribel, Akribel Transparent, Vertex Trayplast, Formatray, Dentalon Plus, Palavit G). To evaluate water sorption and water solubility, thirty square-shaped specimens (20 x 20 x 1. 5 mm) were fabricated from the wax specimens. One way ANOVA test, Tukey test and Pearson correlation coefficient performed for data. Results: Water sorption mean values varied from 11. 33 ± 0. 33 to 30. 46 ± 0. 55 µg/mm 3.

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Triad visible light-polymerized (VLP) reline resin has the {{potential}} to repair denture bases from other resin systems with the elimination of flasking/deflasking procedures. PURPOSE: This study measured the tensile and shear bond strengths of Triad VLP, PMMA, and glass-fiber-reinforced PMMA (GF-PMMA) <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins</b> before and after repair with Triad VLP reline material. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-six specimens were fabricated from Triad VLP, PMMA, and GF-PMMA denture base resins. Both Triad VLP reline material and autopolymerizing <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins</b> were used to repair identical laboratory fabricated resin joints. Twenty-eight rectangular specimens (in 4 different groups of 7 each) were prepared to study the shear bond strength of Triad reline material used to repair different denture base resin joints. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences (P<. 0001) were found between the tensile strengths of specimens repaired with the Triad VLP reline resin used as a repair agent and those repaired with the autopolymerizing resin. The tensile strength of the Triad VLP denture base resin was found to be higher than that of both the PMMA and GF-PMMA <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins.</b> CONCLUSION: The low tensile and shear bond strengths found after the repair of PMMA and GF-PMMA <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins</b> with Triad VLP reline material were attributed to a lack of cohesion/adhesion between the Triad VLP reline material and the interfaces of the treated sites.

Material and methods: A microwave-polymerised (Onda-Cryl) and two heat-polymerised (QC 20 and Lucitone 550) <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins</b> were used. The materials were handled according to the manufacturers` instructions. Fifty rectangular-shaped specimens (8 x 10 x 4 mm) were fabricated from each resin and assigned to 5 groups (n = 10) according to their percentage of Irgaguard B 5000 silver-zinc zeolite (0 %- control, 2. 5 %, 5. 0 %, 7. 5 % and 10 %). Flexural strength and Izod impact strength were evaluated. The antimicrobial activity against two strains of Candida albicans and two strains of Streptococcus mutans was assessed by agar diffusion method. Data were analysed statistically by one-way ANOVA and Tukey`s test at 5 % significance level. Results: The addition of 2. 5 % of Irgaguard B 5000 to the materials resulted in antimicrobial activity against all strains. Flexural strength decreased significantly with the addition of 2. 5 % (QC 20 and Lucitone 550) and 5. 0 % (Onda-Cryl) of Irgaguard B 5000.
