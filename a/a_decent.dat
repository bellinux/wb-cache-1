5|$|Not much {{is known}} about the early history of John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, another Lancastrian commander; the chronicles mention little about him until the Battle of Losecoat Field. His father, the {{previous}} earl and a loyal Lancastrian, was executed for a failed plot to assassinate Edward IV. The Yorkist king tried to secure the loyalty of Oxford by knighting him and pardoning his transgressions. This tactic failed; Oxford remained true to the Lancastrian crown and participated in Warwick's effort to dethrone Edward. Historians describe the young Oxford as <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> military leader, exemplified by his conduct in the Battle of Barnet.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the social}} status of nobles, officials, farmers, and artisan-craftsmen were {{considered}} above the station of the lowly registered merchant, wealthy and successful businessmen acquired huge fortunes which {{allowed them to}} rival the social prestige {{of even the most}} powerful nobles and highest officials. Slaves were {{at the bottom of the}} social order, yet they represented only a tiny portion of the overall population. Retainers attached themselves to the estates of wealthy landowners, while medical physicians and state-employed religious occultists could make <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> living. People of all social classes believed in various deities, spirits, immortals, and demons. While Han Daoists were organized into small groups chiefly concerned with achieving immortality through various means, by the mid 2nd century CE they formed large hierarchical religious societies that challenged imperial authority and viewed Laozi (fl. 6th century BCE) as a holy prophet.|$|E
5|$|Articles 41–43 mandate the State to {{endeavour}} to secure to all citizens the right to work, a living wage, social security, maternity relief, and <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> standard of living. These provisions aim at establishing a socialist state as envisaged in the Preamble. Article 43 also places upon the State the responsibility of promoting cottage industries, {{and the federal government}} has, in furtherance of this, established several Boards for the promotion of khadi, handlooms etc., in coordination with the state governments. Article 39A requires the State to provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are available to all citizens irrespective of economic or other disabilities. Article 43A mandates the State to work towards securing the participation of workers in the management of industries. The State, under Article 46, is also mandated to promote the interests of and work for the economic uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and protect them from discrimination and exploitation. Several enactments, including two Constitutional amendments, have been passed to give effect to this provision.|$|E

5|$|In {{a suburb}} of Bucharest, a 13-year-old boy, Andrei (Gabriel Huian), {{together}} {{with some of his}} friends, watches the prostitutes' show every night from a rooftop and how they are being taken by drivers. The boy falls in love with one of the girls, called Marilena (Mădălina Ghiţescu), and finds out that he needs <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> sum of money in order to approach her. Thus, he steals his father's (Gabriel Spahiu) salary and goes to the prostitutes' meeting place. Marilena's pimp (Andi Vasluianu) is also present, and only agrees to send Marilena and another prostitute with the boy to a nearby pub, where the Rom Elvis is singing (played by the singer Elvis Romano, who translated Elvis Presley's lyrics into his own language). The prostitutes play with Andrei, telling him that he needs a car in order to date them, then they leave. The boy asks Marilena for her phone number, and she writes something in his hand.|$|E
5|$|In the 1963–64 season, the Royals {{achieved}} a 55–25 record, which put them {{second place in}} the Eastern Division. Under new coach Jack McMahon, Robertson flourished, {{and for the first time}} in his career, he had <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> supporting cast: second scoring option Jack Twyman was now supplemented by Jerry Lucas and Wayne Embry, and fellow guard Adrian Smith helped Robertson in the backcourt. Robertson led the NBA in free-throw percentage, scored a career-high 31.4 points per game, and averaged 9.9 rebounds and 11.0 assists per game. The averages for his first five NBA seasons are a triple-double: 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and 10.6 assists per game. He won the NBA MVP award and became the only player other than Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain to win it from 1960 to 1968. Robertson also won his second All-Star Game MVP award that year after scoring 26 points, grabbing 14 rebounds, and dishing off 8 assists in an East victory. In the postseason, the Royals defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, but then were dominated by the Celtics 4 games to 1.|$|E

After performing well in those exhibition games, he made the Phillies' 2014 Opening Day roster, and although he walked too many hitters, showed some potential to emerge as <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> relief pitcher. His teammates described him as a good personality to have in the bullpen, and his coaches approved of his development. Meanwhile, he is pursuing another college degree; he is studying merchandise marketing at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising.|$|E

5|$|The Las Vegas {{situation}} {{was one of}} a bevy of developments that absorbed the league in the 1994 to 1995 offseason. The team was not officially disbanded until April 1995 but not before the league damaged its credibility by twice giving provisional approval to a relocation to Jackson, Mississippi, {{to the point where the}} Mississippi team was included on the 1995 internal schedule and had hired a general manager and coaching staff, only to have the deal collapse amid squabbles with the Las Vegas corporation that owned the Posse. A group from Miami, Florida tried to convince the league to let it buy the remains of the Posse and move them to South Florida as the Miami Manatees in the Miami Orange Bowl. An exhibition game between Birmingham and Baltimore was held there in June 1995 to gauge support, which drew <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> crowd just above 20,000.|$|E
5|$|The Sounds {{compiled}} a 68–76record, 20games out of first-place, in 1995.

However, with the ongoing MLB strike, Jordan decided to quit the sport rather than becoming a replacement player and being labeled a strikebreaker. The team improved their record in 1996, ending up with 77wins and 67losses. Despite <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> winning percentage, Nashville failed to secure {{a spot in the}} playoffs. Outfielder Jeff Abbott won the Rookie of the Year Award, and Rick Renick earned his second Manager of the Year Award. Joey Vierra pitched in a career franchise-record 238games from 1990 to 1992 and 1994 to 1995.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{campaign}} received mixed impressions from reviewers. USgamer editor Jaz Rignall {{thought it}} was great for teaching the mechanics of the game and the progression of difficulty was reasonable. GameSpot reviewer Kallie Plagge thought the highest points of the campaign missions were the sequences that borrowed elements from the main Halo games. Brown stated that while the campaign was brief, he felt it had good pacing and there was <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> variety of objectives and scenarios. Stapleton agreed that the campaign missions offered enough variety to prevent them from becoming repetitive. However, overall he was unimpressed by the campaign missions, which he perceived as unambitious in their design. He was also surprised by the frequent bugs, which included crashing and mission events failing to trigger, that he experienced during his playthrough of the campaign on the Xbox One.|$|E
