5|$|The Shogunate {{also was}} {{preparing}} for further conflict by modernizing its forces. In line with Parkes' designs, the British, previously the Shogunate's primary partner, proved reluctant to provide assistance. The Tokugawa thus came to rely mainly on French expertise, comforted by the military prestige of Napoleon III at that time, acquired through his successes in the Crimean War <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> of Italy.|$|E

5|$|A {{thousand}} years before The Sword of Shannara, an Elf named Galaphile gathers {{all of the}} people who still had some knowledge of the old world to Paranor to try to bring peace and order to all of the races. They name themselves the First Druid Council. Brona, a rogue Druid, and his followers leave, taking the Ildatch with them; this magical tome controls their minds. 250 years later, Brona begins the First War of the Races when he convinces all Men to attack the other races. He almost succeeds in seizing rule of the Four Lands, but the tide turns, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> ends with his defeat and disappearance. The Druids divide the Four Lands among the races and become reclusive, withdrawing to Paranor because of their shame at the betrayal by one of their own members.|$|E

5|$|American {{forces in}} Iraq were {{withdrawn}} {{in large numbers}} in 2009 and 2010, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in the region was declared formally over in December 2011. The withdrawal caused an escalation of sectarian insurgency, leading {{to the rise of}} the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the successor of al-Qaeda in the region. In 2014, Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba {{for the first time since}} 1961. The next year, the United States as a member of the P5+1 countries signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement aimed to slow the development of Iran's nuclear program.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{permanent}} garrisons at Berwick, Calais, and Carlisle, England's {{standing army}} numbered {{only a few}} hundred men. This was increased only slightly by Henry. Henry's invasion force of 1513, some 30,000 men, was composed of billmen and longbowmen, {{at a time when the}} other European nations were moving to hand guns and pikemen. The difference in capability was at this stage not significant, however, and Henry's forces had new armour and weaponry. They were also supported by battlefield artillery <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> wagon, relatively new innovations, and several large and expensive siege guns. The invasion force of 1544 was similarly well-equipped and organised, although command on the battlefield was laid with the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk, which in the case of the latter produced disastrous results at Montreuil.|$|E
5|$|As Grant {{continued}} to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President Stephens led {{a group to}} meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at Hampton Roads. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as {{he walked through the}} city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but freedmen greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> was effectively over.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1943 season, Wensloff enlisted in the United States Army and served in World War II. When the Yankees were preparing {{for the start of the}} 1944 season, the team originally had no idea where Wensloff was, as they had not heard from him. He was inactive for the 1944 season. In 1945, Wensloff was traded from the Yankees to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League for Johnny Kreevich, allowing him to simultaneously pitch professionally and continue serving in the war. In 10 games for the Padres, he won three and lost four with a 3.82 ERA. After the 1945 season <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> ended, Wensloff remained in military service, and as a result did not play in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Boston's harbor {{activity}} was significantly curtailed by the Embargo Act of 1807 (adopted during the Napoleonic Wars) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> of 1812. Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital {{investments in the}} interim. Manufacturing became {{an important component of}} the city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century. Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers until the early 20th century, and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.|$|E
5|$|Charles VI died on 20 October 1740, {{probably}} of mushroom poisoning. He {{had ignored}} {{the advice of}} Prince Eugene of Savoy who had urged him to concentrate on filling the treasury and equipping the army rather than on acquiring signatures of fellow monarchs. The Emperor, who spent his entire reign securing the Pragmatic Sanction, left Austria in an impoverished state, bankrupted by the recent Turkish war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> of the Polish Succession; the treasury contained only 100,000 florins, which were claimed by his widow. The army numbered only 80,000men, most of whom had not been paid in months; they were nevertheless remarkably loyal and devoted to their new sovereign.|$|E
