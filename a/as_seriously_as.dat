They eventually concluded {{that it was all}} a hoax, outlining in detail the reasons for their verdict, and giving detailed evidence that the Holy Blood authors had not reported comprehensively. They imply that this evidence had been ignored by Lincoln, Baigent, and Leigh to bolster the mythical version of the Priory's history that was developed by Plantard during the early 1960s after meeting author Gérard de Sède.|$|E

500|$|Whittall {{believes}} {{that one reason}} for Britten's enduring popularity is the [...] "progressive conservatism" [...] of his music. He generally avoided the avant garde, and did not challenge the conventions {{in the way that}} contemporaries such as Tippett did. Perhaps, says Brett, [...] "the tide that swept away serialism, atonality and most forms of musical modernism and brought in neo-Romanticism, minimalism and other modes of expression involved with tonality carried with it renewed interest in composers who had been {{out of step with the}} times". Britten defined his mission as a composer in very simple terms: composers should aim at [...] "pleasing people today <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>as</b> we can".|$|E
500|$|During the shoot, Harris {{suffered}} from depression, {{and believed that}} her co-stars {{did not take the}} film <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>as</b> she did. At times, she would cry in her makeup chair prior to the day's shoot. Bloom did not speak to Harris while filming continued, which worsened her depression. Afterward, Bloom told Harris that the lack of interaction had helped her build her own performance and the two women reconciled. [...] Harris incorporated her own depression into her performance. Wise heightened the sense of character conflict by having the characters [...] "step on one another's lines", allowing one character to begin talking before the other had finished. On occasion, the characters simply talk at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Barney did {{not take}} her poetry <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>as</b> Vivien did, saying, [...] "if I had one {{ambition}} it was to make my life itself into a poem." [...] Her plays were only performed through amateur productions in her garden. According to Karla Jay, most of them lacked coherent plots and [...] "would probably baffle even the most sympathetic audience." [...] After 1910 she mostly wrote the epigrams and memoirs for which she is better known. Her last book of poetry was called Poems & Poemes: Autres Alliances and came out in 1920, bringing together romantic poetry in both French and English. Barney asked Ezra Pound to edit the poems but then ignored the detailed recommendations he made.|$|E
25|$|The England–Germany {{football}} rivalry {{is considered}} to be mainly an English phenomenon—in the run-up to any competition match between the two teams, many UK newspapers will print articles detailing results of previous encounters, such as those in 1966 and 1990. Football fans in England often consider Germany to be their main sporting rivals and care more about this rivalry than those with other nations, such as Argentina or Scotland. Most German fans consider the Netherlands or Italy to be their traditional footballing rivals, and as such, usually the rivalry is not taken quite <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> there <b>as</b> it is in England.|$|R

500|$|... "Home" [...] {{was first}} {{submitted}} to the censors featuring audio of the baby screaming while being buried alive. Ten Thirteen Productions was asked by Fox executives to alter the audio so that the baby would sound sick; they noted that the audio change was needed to show the child was diseased and that the Peacocks were not simply killing an innocent child. Manners called the shot, shown from the child's perspective, of the baby's burial as [...] "the most awful shot of my career". He said that he approached filming <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>as</b> he could because he felt the script was a classic. [...] When production was finished, {{he said that he}} loved the episode and called it one of his favorites. Duchovny agreed with Manners, saying, [...] "I really like that one. Although it didn't scare me." [...] He explained that it [...] "touched" [...] him with its themes concerning the desire to [...] "live and to propagate." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} {{was one of}} a number of British works challenging the set categories of the rigid, French-dictated hierarchy of genres in the late 18th century, as other types of painting aspired to be treated <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>as</b> the costumed history painting of a Classical or mythological subject. In some respects the Orrery and Air Pump subjects resembled conversation pieces, then largely a form of middle-class portraiture, though soon to be given new status when Johann Zoffany began to paint the royal family in about 1766. Given their solemn atmosphere however, and as it seems none of the figures are intended to be understood as portraits (even if models may be identified), the paintings can not be regarded as conversation pieces. The 20th-century art historian Ellis Waterhouse compares these two works to the [...] "genre serieux" [...] of contemporary French drama, as defined by Denis Diderot and Pierre Beaumarchais, a view endorsed by Egerton.|$|E

[...] U.S. {{president}} Barack Obama called the incident [...] "absolutely tragic and heartbreaking" [...] but noted that he was [...] "proud generally" [...] of what U.S. troops have accomplished in Afghanistan. Obama said the incident did not represent the [...] "exceptional character" [...] of the American military and the respect that the United States had for the people of Afghanistan. On 13 March, he said, [...] "the United States takes this <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>as</b> if it were our own citizens and our own children who were murdered. We’re heartbroken over the loss of innocent life. The killing of innocent civilians is outrageous and it’s unacceptable." [...] In response to a reporter asking whether the killings could be likened to the 1968 My Lai massacre of civilians by U.S. forces in South Vietnam, Obama replied, [...] "It's not comparable.

500|$|As {{the most}} egregious offence an {{individual}} could commit, viewed <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>as</b> though the accused had personally attacked the monarch, high treason demanded the ultimate punishment. [...] But whereas men guilty of this crime were hanged, drawn and quartered, women were drawn and burned. [...] In his Commentaries on the Laws of England the 18th-century English jurist William Blackstone noted that the sentence, [...] "to be drawn to the gallows, and there to be burned alive", was [...] "full as terrible to the sensation as the other". [...] Blackstone wrote that women were burned rather than quartered as [...] "the decency due to the sex forbids the exposing and publicly mangling their bodies". [...] However, an observation by historian Jules Michelet, that [...] "the first flame to rise consumed the clothes, revealing poor trembling nakedness", may, {{in the opinion of}} historian Vic Gatrell, suggest that this solution is [...] "misconceived". [...] In The Hanging Tree, Gatrell concludes that the occasional live burial of women in Europe gave tacit acknowledgement to the possibility that a struggling, kicking female hanging from a noose could [...] "elicit obscene fantasies" [...] from watching males.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{consider}} Angelou's autobiographies to be {{more important}} than her poetry, including William Sylvester, who states that although Angelou's books have been best-sellers, her poetry has not been perceived <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>as</b> her prose. Despite her popular and critical acclaim garnered by her autobiographies, her poetry has been understudied, even after her recitation of [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] in 1993. Like many reviewers of Angelou's poetry, Ellen Lippmann in her review of And Still I Rise in School Library Journal finds Angelou's prose stronger than her poetry, but found her strength more apparent in the poems in this volume than in Caged Bird. In his negative review of And Still I Rise, Stepto expresses disbelief that Angelou's poems would be produced by a major publishing house while poetry written by other lesser-known talents could not. He explains her popularity as a poet with her autobiographies, which he calls [...] "marvelous" [...] and the real reason for her success as a poet. He states that her poetry serves as explanatory texts for her prose works, which he calls [...] "more adeptly rendered self-portraits".|$|E
500|$|Capcom's Viewtiful Joe (2003) used cel-shaded {{graphics}} and innovative gameplay features (such as the protagonist's special powers) to [...] "reinvigorate" [...] its traditional 2D scrolling formula. The Behemoth's Castle Crashers (2008) also featured cartoon graphics, quirky humor, and acclaimed cooperative gameplay. Rockstar Games' The Warriors (based on the 1979 {{movie of the}} same name), released in 2005, featured large scale brawling in 3D environments interspersed with other activities such as chase sequences. The game also featured a more traditional side-scrolling beat 'em up Armies of the Night as bonus content, which was acclaimed along with the main game and was later released on the PlayStation Portable. Releases such as God Hand in 2006 and MadWorld in 2009 were seen as parodies of violence in popular culture, earning both games praise for not taking themselves <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>as</b> early beat 'em up games. Classic beat 'em ups have been re-released on services such as the Virtual Console; critics reaffirmed the appeal of some, while the appeal of others has been deemed to have diminished with time. Although the genre lacks the same presence {{it did in the}} late 1980s, some titles such as Viewtiful Joe and God Hand kept the genre alive.|$|E

2500|$|Currently, the {{principles}} of natural justice in the United Kingdom and certain other jurisdictions do not include a general rule that reasons should be given for decisions. In R. v.

If the tribunal does state its reasons, and those reasons are wrong in law, certiorari lies to quash the decision."

After the band discussed his behavior with Vänskä several times, without getting any change, everyone simply stopped caring and tensions grew. Meanwhile, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen had started complaining about his role in the band, feeling like [...] "a hired gun who would only do what he's asked to". According to their music teacher, Plamen Dimov, he and Holopainen have totally different characters, and thus difficulties were expected to arise.

[...] However, he argues, [...] "sometimes just the facts will do, and the U.S. News manual offers them in great heaps [...] Sarah Lawrence, for example, does not take into consideration SAT or ACT scores. Don't even send 'em, it tells high school students. That tells me all I need to know about Sarah Lawrence. It tells me that Sarah Lawrence doesn't take aptitude <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>as</b> I'd like. The university depends far more on high school grades, which, as anyone who has taught at the college level knows, cannot be trusted. If last year's freshman classes at several colleges all had composite high school grade point averages of 3.6 to 3.8, I don't know how the intellectual caliber of one differs from another. But if one college attracted high school students whose SATs averaged 1100 to 1200, and another attracted students with SATs averaging 1300 to 1400, I know the latter is more selective.
