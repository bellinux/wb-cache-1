5|$|A Corded Ware culture princely burial {{was found}} in Szczytna, Subcarpathian Voivodeship. The grave, well-secured three meters below the surface, {{contained}} a man's skeleton and a funerary gift collection of highly valuable copper decorations, containers, stone tools and arrowheads.

The D-1 is widely considered a valuable element of Soviet artillery.|$|E
5|$|Offa's Dyke, most {{of which}} was {{probably}} built in his reign, is <b>a</b> <b>testimony</b> to the extensive resources Offa had at his command {{and his ability to}} organise them. Other surviving sources include a problematic document known as the Tribal Hidage, which may provide further evidence of Offa's scope as a ruler, though its attribution to his reign is disputed. A significant corpus of letters dates from the period, especially from Alcuin, an English deacon and scholar who spent over a decade at Charlemagne's court as one of his chief advisors, and corresponded with kings, nobles and ecclesiastics throughout England. These letters in particular reveal Offa's relations with the continent, as does his coinage, which was based on Carolingian examples.|$|E
5|$|The Nandi in Sivalokanathar Temple, Tirupunkur is seen placed {{off centre}} as <b>a</b> <b>testimony</b> of Nandanar's devotion and the miracle. A stone {{image of the}} saint is worshipped in the temple. The Dvarapalas (gate-keeper sculptures) are {{depicted}} with his heads leaning downwards, {{said to be in}} honour of Nandanar. In 1959, a shrine was created outside the Shiva temple, from where the stone image of Nandanar looks eternally at Shiva. Nandanar is depicted with his hands joined above his head, praying to Shiva. Scenes of Bharati's opera and the local legend of Nandanar and Ganesha digging the temple tank are seen on the shrine.|$|E

5|$|The current {{construction}} of the al-Aqsa Mosque is dated to the early Umayyad period of rule in Palestine. Architectural historian K. A. C. Creswell, referring to <b>a</b> <b>testimony</b> by Arculf, a Gallic monk, during his pilgrimage to Palestine in 679–82, notes {{the possibility that the}} second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, Umar ibn al-Khattab, erected a primitive quadrangular building for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers somewhere on the Haram ash-Sharif. However, Arculf visited Palestine during the reign of Mu'awiyah I, and it is possible that Mu'awiyah ordered the construction, not Umar. This latter claim is explicitly supported by the early Muslim scholar al-Muthahhar bin Tahir.|$|E
5|$|White Star then {{ordered a}} new 212-foot bow section from Harland and Wolff in Belfast, which was {{launched}} head-first in October 1907. It was popularly {{said at the}} time that Suevic was the longest ship in the world, with her bow in Belfast and her stern in Southampton. The new bow was then towed to the shipyard of J.I. Thornycroft in Southampton, where it arrived on 26 October. By mid-November it was in position and being joined {{to the rest of the}} ship. The bow was a good fit, <b>a</b> <b>testimony</b> to the craftsmanship of the Harland and Wolff shipwrights. Ten months later, after the largest ship rebuilding effort ever undertaken at the time, on 14 January 1908, Suevic was completed and returned to service.|$|E
5|$|In 1085, when Alexios {{recovered}} the strategically important Adriatic {{port city of}} Dyrrhachium from the Normans who had occupied it, John Doukas was installed as the military governor (doux) of the local province. John remained there until 1092, when he was replaced by John Komnenos, {{the son of the}} emperor's brother, the sebastokrator Isaac. His tenure was apparently very successful. John repelled the Serbian incursions from Duklja and Raška, and even, according to Anna Komnene, captured the Dukljan king Constantine Bodin (r. 1081–1101), before restoring him to power as a client of the Byzantine Empire. Thus John managed to restore order in the region of Albania and Dalmatia, which had suffered greatly during the Byzantine–Norman wars of the previous years. Surviving correspondence from the archbishop Theophylact of Ohrid is <b>a</b> <b>testimony</b> to his success; after John's departure from the post, Theophylact expressed nostalgia for the time of his governorship and asked for his advice.|$|E

5|$|She first reconstructed the Church of St. George {{built by}} Đurađ II Balšić on Beška island on Lake Skadar and in 1439/1440 built as her {{endowment}} the Church of Holy Mother next to it. She {{was buried in}} its western vault, near the southern wall of the church. The purpose of her endowment was to be her crypt and {{to serve as the}} spiritual center which would continue the orientation of the Serbian culture toward Byzantine Orthodox spirituality in this historically last period of Serbian medieval statehood. In this way Jelena confirmed her loyalty to the tradition of the Nemanjić dynasty and her father Prince Lazar in the period when she was able to make a political choice between Islam and militant Catholicism. Jelena's efforts had an additional dimension taking into consideration that her work is <b>a</b> <b>testimony</b> of the presence of the Byzantine hesychasm in the Serbian Despotate.|$|E
5|$|The King {{must have}} been {{impressed}} by Edington's performance, because in 1344 he made him treasurer of the realm, a position he held for the exceptionally long period of twelve years. This was a job fraught with problems, as the nation was in serious financial difficulties by the mid-1340s. The treasury was in great debt from the heavy demands of {{the early stages of}} the Hundred Years' War. By then reneging on his debts, the king had lost public confidence, and struggled to obtain new loans. Edington saw the need to bring all royal expenditure under the oversight of the exchequer. This did not entail controlling the King's use of his resources– a move Edward would have resented greatly– but simply attempting to budget all revenues and expenses. By the early 1360s this was largely achieved; <b>a</b> <b>testimony</b> to the capabilities and energy of Edington as an administrator. In 1356 he was named chancellor, a post he held until his retirement from the national scene in 1363, possibly for health reasons.|$|E
5|$|Though Stowell's {{hypothesis}} was incorrect, his article rekindled {{interest in the}} Jack the Ripper case, and in 1973 the BBC launched a television series, Jack the Ripper, which investigated the Whitechapel murders. The series mixed documentary and drama; it featured real evidence but was hosted by fictional detectives Barlow and Watt, played by Stratford Johns and Frank Windsor, respectively. The series {{was made into a}} book, The Ripper File, by Elwyn Jones and John Lloyd in 1975. The sixth and final programme included <b>a</b> <b>testimony</b> by Joseph Gorman, who called himself Joseph Sickert and claimed to be the illegitimate son of noted painter Walter Sickert. Gorman claimed that Sickert had told him a story that implicated not only the royal family but also a host of other famous people in the murders. According to Gorman, Gull committed the murders with the help of accomplices. Stowell had mentioned rumours implicating Gull in his article, but had dismissed them as unfair and false.|$|E

5|$|Established as a seaport by the Vikings and Danish traders {{at the end}} of the 8th {{century in}} the Prussian border area {{previously}} already explored by the Scandinavians, Truso lasted as a major city and commercial center until the early 11th century, when it was destroyed and replaced in that capacity by Gdańsk. The settlement covered an area of 20 hectares and consisted of a two-dock seaport, the craft-trade portion, and the peripheral residential development, all protected by a wood and earth bulwark separating it from the mainland. The port-trade and craftsmen zones were themselves separated by a fire control ditch with water flowing through it. There were several rows of houses, including long Viking hall structures, waterside warehouses, market areas and wooden beam covered streets. Numerous relics were found there, including weights used also as currency units, coins (from English to Arab) and workshops processing metal, jewelry or large quantities of amber. Remnants of long Viking boats were also found, the whole complex being <b>a</b> <b>testimony</b> to Viking preoccupation with commerce, the mainstay of their activities around the Baltic Sea region. The multi-ethnic Truso had extensive trade contacts not only with distant lands and Scandinavia, but also the Slavic areas located to the south and west of it, from where ceramics and other products were transported along the Vistula in river crafts. Ironically, Truso's sudden destruction by fire and subsequent disappearance was apparently a result of a Viking raid.|$|E
