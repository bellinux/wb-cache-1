50|$|LB {{films are}} formed when {{amphiphilic}} molecules like surfactants or nanoparticles interact with air at an air-water interface. Surfactants (or surface-acting agents) are molecules with hydrophobic 'tails' and hydrophilic 'heads'. When surfactant concentration {{is less than}} critical micellar concentration (CMC), the surfactant molecules arrange themselves as shown in Figure 1 below. This tendency {{can be explained by}} surface-energy considerations. Since the tails are hydrophobic, their exposure to air is favoured over that to water. Similarly, since the heads are hydrophilic, the head-water interaction is more favourable than <b>air-water</b> <b>interaction.</b> The overall effect is reduction in the surface energy (or equivalently, surface tension of water).|$|E

40|$|Mixed flows {{characterized}} by a simultaneous occurrence of free surface and pressurized flows are often encountered in hydraulic engineering. Numerous researches have been dedicated to unify the mathematical description of both flows. Herein, shock-capturing models succeed in giving {{a unique set of}} equations. However, no method accounts for both air-entrapment and air-entrainment. This study proposes an original model to simulate <b>air–water</b> <b>interactions</b> in mixed flows. The new approach relies on the area-integration of a three-phase model over two layers. The applicability of this free surface model is extended to pressurized flows by a modified pressure term accounting for the dispersed air. The derived modelling system WOLF IMPack is then validated.

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] bottom outlets {{play a vital role}} in dam operation and safety, as they allow controlling the water surface elevation below the spillway level. For partial openings, water flows under the gate lip at high velocity and drags the air downstream of the gate, which may cause damages due to cavitation and vibration. The convenience of installing air vents in dam bottom outlets is well known by practitioners. The design of this element depends basically on the maximum air flow through the air vent, which in turn is a function of the specific geometry and the boundary conditions. The intrinsic features of this phenomenon makes it hard to analyse either on site or in full scaled experimental facilities. As a consequence, empirical formulas are frequently employed, which offer a conservative estimate of the maximum air flow. In this work, the particle finite element method was used to model the <b>air–water</b> <b>interaction</b> in Susqueda Dam bottom outlet, with different gate openings. Specific enhancements of the formulation were developed to consider <b>air–water</b> <b>interaction.</b> The results were analysed as compared to the conventional design criteria and to information gathered on site during the gate operation tests.

40|$|Hydraulic models {{available}} in literature are unsuccessful in simulating accurately and efficiently environmental flows {{characterized by the}} presence of both <b>air–water</b> <b>interactions</b> and free-surface/pressurized transitions (aka mixed flows). The {{purpose of this paper is}} thus to fill this knowledge gap by developing a unified one-dimensional mathematical model describing free-surface, pressurized and mixed flows with <b>air–water</b> <b>interactions.</b> This work is part of a general research project which aims at establishing a unified mathematical model suitable to describe the vast majority of flows likely to appear in civil and environmental engineering (pure water flows, sediment transport, pollutant transport, aerated flows...). In order to tackle this problem, our original methodology consists in both time- and spaceaveraging the Local Instant Formulation, which includes field equations for each phase taken separately and jump conditions, over a flow cross-section involving a free-surface. Subsequently, applicability of the model is extended to pressurized flows as well. The first key result is an original 1 D homogeneous Equilibrium Model which describes two-phase free-surface flows. It is proven to be fundamentally multiphase, to take into account scale heterogeneities of environmental flow and to be very easy to solve. Next, applicability of this free-surface model is extended to pressurized flows by using the classical Preissmann slot concept. A second key result here is the introduction of an original negative Preissmann slot to simulate sub-atmospheric pressurized flows. The model is then closed by using constitutive equations suitable for air–water flows. Finally, this mathematical model is discretised by means of a finite volume scheme and validated by comparison with experimental results from a physical model in the case of a steady flow in a large scale gallery.

40|$|ABSTRACT: During the {{six years}} long Pasachalk project devoted to the {{mechanical}} behaviour of high porosity chalks from North Sea oilfields, the constitutive model Pasachalk (Collin et al., 2002) was proposed based on the Barcelona Basic Model (BBM) (Alonso et al., 1990). The approach {{was based on the}} similarities found between the oil-water interactions (oil and water being the non wetting and wetting fluid respectively) in oil reservoir chalk and the <b>air-water</b> <b>interactions</b> in unsaturated soils. This approach appeared to be relevant to interpret the subsidence of the seafloor during waterflooding operations for enhanced oil recovery that has been observed in North Sea oilfields (e. g. Ekofisk oilfield). Another important component of subsidence was then related to the creep behaviour of the multiphase chalk (De Gennaro et al., 2003). A modified Pasachalk model was proposed to account for time effects using the framework of Perzyna’s viscoplasticity (1964) but without considering suction effects. Based on available experimental results (Priol et al., 2007), {{a modified version of the}} viscoplastic Pasachalk model including suction effects is proposed in this paper. ...|$|R

In certain circumstances, and in particular for droplet Reynolds numbers below a critical value which is about ten million, the <b>air-water</b> <b>interaction</b> depends to leading order on lubricating forces in the air coupled with potential flow dynamics in the water.

Herein new air-water flow experiments {{were conducted on}} several stepped spillways with embankment dam slopes using with phase-detection intrusive probes. The present data were compared with previous studies in terms of energy dissipation, flow aeration and air-water mass transfer. The air-water mass transfer was calculated based upon air-water flow measurements in terms of dissolved oxygen. The re-oxygenation rates were compared with previous studies comprising both conductivity and direct dissolved oxygen measurements. The comparison highlighted a monotonic increase of aeration efficiency with energy dissipation rate.

40|$|Emptying of an {{initially}} water-filled horizontal PVC pipeline {{driven by}} different upstream compressed air pressures and with different outflow restriction conditions, with motion of an air-water front through the pressurized pipeline, is investigated experimentally. Simple numerical modeling {{is used to}} interpret the results, especially the observed additional shortening of the moving full water column due to formation of a stratified water-air 2 ̆ 2 tail 2 ̆ 2. Measured discharges, water-level changes and pressure variations along the pipeline during emptying are compared using Control Volume model results. The CV model solutions for a non-stratified case are shown to be delayed {{as compared with the}} actual measured changes of flow rate, pressure and water level, but by considering water-column mass loss due to the water-air tail and residual motion, the calibrated CV model yields solutions that are qualitatively in good agreement with the experimental results. A key interpretation is that the long air-cavity celerity is close to its critical value at the instant of minimum flow acceleration. The influences of driving pressure, inertia and friction predominate, with the observed water hammer caused by the initiating downstream valve opening not significantly influencing the water-air front propagation.

Intrusion of the pressurized air {{on top of the}} water column inside the horizontal pipeline can result in a less or more mixed stratified flow. The dynamics of a moving air–water front during the emptying of a PVC pipeline with the diameter-to-length ratio 1 : 1100 were experimentally and theoretically studied. In the experiments, the water was driven out of the pipeline with an initial upstream air pressure of 2 barg and a 4. 5 m high downstream-end siphon, where the water outflow was restricted by a valve that was closed 11 %. The measured discharges and water-level variations are analysed together with Control Volume modelling results. During the ‘forced’ (not only gravity-driven) emptying process, both the downstream-end drainage and tail leakage behind the moving air–water front decreased over the full water-column length. The water-column mass loss due to the tail leakage is referred to as holdup.

40|$|Interactions between {{turbulent}} {{waters and}} the atmosphere may lead to some air-water mixing, often called 2 ̆ 7 white water 2 ̆ 7. This study reviews the basic entrainment processes {{for a wide range}} of flow situations and presents new evidence leading to a better understanding of the basic multiphase flow dynamics. The focus is on flow situations characterised by very-strong <b>air-water</b> <b>interactions</b> : e. g., vertical plunging jet, stepped chute flow, plunging breaker. The two basic entrainment mechanisms are local and interfacial aerations. In a local aeration process, air is entrapped at the singularity/discontinuity between the impinging jet and the receiving pool of water. At low jet velocities, the bubbles are entrained individually while, at high jet impact velocities, an elongated air cavity is set into motion between the entrained fluid and the jet flow. At impingement, air is entrapped by a Couette flow mechanism. Interfacial aeration occurs when turbulent velocity fluctuations acting next to the free-surface become large enough to overcome surface tension and buoyancy. The sizes of the bubbles and droplets extend over several orders of magnitude. Void fraction distributions may be modelled by advective diffusion models. Turbulence intensity measurements suggest high levels of turbulence across the entire air-water flow, of one to two orders of magnitude greater than in monophase flows. In coastal engineering, air entrainment is characterised by unsteadiness and high levels of aeration. The results demonstrate that air entrainment in coastal and oceanic zones is an important process and cannot be ignored...|$|R

The study of raindrops is interesting from both an engineering standpoint and from a standpoint of pure curiosity. As a natural phenomenon, rainfall is something which is experienced by everybody, yet its properties are often misunderstood. The primary engineering application is in improving the ability of radar to determine the characteristics of rainfall for meteorological purposes. The significant original contributions to knowledge within this work come from several areas. The numerical methods used are a unique combination of a high order incompressible implicit large eddy simulation method, a conservative level set method, and a pressure projection method. These methods have all been implemented on a highly parallel GPU architecture, with a resulting performance increase of approximately ten times when a single GPU was compared to a single CPU core. The water droplets were simulated in a regime not previously studied by three dimensional methods. The results of these simulations confirmed the validity of the numerical model by reproducing several important experimental results. New insight was then gained regarding the behaviour of droplet wakes, an area with little previous research. The results of the test simulations show great promise for future use of the numerical framework developed. While the simulations todate have been of <b>air-water</b> <b>interactions,</b> there is little reason the model should be constrained to such a system.

Statistically quasi-steady flow properties, such as mean velocity profiles, turbulent intensities, Reynolds stress and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget terms show significant differences between air-water interface turbulence near the water side (IntT-w) and wall-bounded turbulence(WT) while there are some similarities between IntT-w and free surface turbulence (FST). Due to the velocity fluctuation at the interface, water side near interface turbulence flow (IntT-w) is characterized with a thinner viscous sub-layer and decreased intercept parameter B in log-law layer, strengthened Reynolds stress and eddy viscosity, together with a stronger production term, decreasing-then-increasing dissipation term and negative turbulent diffusion term in TKE budget.

However, viewing a substrate from multiple angles would likely result in different spectral characteristics for most coral reef substrates and provide valuable information on structural properties. To {{understand the relationship between}} the morphology of a substrate and its spectral response it is necessary to correct the observed above-water radiance for the effects of atmosphere and water attenuation, at a number of view and azimuth angles. In this way the actual surface reflectance can be determined. This research examines the <b>air-water</b> surface <b>interaction</b> for two hypothetical atmospheric conditions (clear Rayleigh scattering and totally cloudcovered) and the global irradiance reaching the benthic surface. It accounts for both water scattering and absorption, with simplifications for shallow water conditions, as well as the additive effect of background reflectance being reflected at the water-air surface at angles greater than the critical refraction angle (~ 48 °). A model was developed to correct measured above-water radiance along the refracted view angle for its decrease due to path attenuation and the "n squared law of radiance" and the additive surface reflectance. This allows bidirectional benthic surface reflectance and nadir-normalised reflectance to be determined. These theoretical models were adapted to incorporate above-water measures relative to a standard, diffuse, white reference panel.

It was observed that a 10 C drop in ambient air temperature causes the condensing temperature of the refrigerant to drop by 0. 60 C. This drop in condensing temperature of the refrigerant causes a decrease in power consumption of the unit, accompanied by an increase in Coefficient of Performance (COP). Results obtained shows that up to 44 % increase in COP, and a 20 % decrease in power consumption can be achieved by employing evaporative cooling. Additionally, the COP was found to increase by 4 % for every 10 C drop in refrigerant condensing temperature. The water consumption pattern of the hybrid system is monitored to provide a realistic estimate of the operating cost, and profitability of the hybrid system. It was observed that 0. 34 liters of water is consumed for every percent increase in COP. To provide a realistic estimate of the daily water consumption of the hybrid system, the operation time was increased from 1 - 4 hours, in step increments of 1 hour. The volume of water consumed was found to increase by a factor of 1. 8, 2. 5, and 3. 2, for 2 hrs, 3 hrs and 4 hrs of operation respectively.

Study of lake evaporation includes various aspects of Dr Brutsaert’s interests such as the exchange processes on water surface, the development of internal boundary layer, estimation of evaporation rate, among others. In the present study, issues on <b>air-water</b> <b>interaction</b> were first revisited. Secondly, horizontal distribution of latent heat fluxes over the lake surface was estimated to study its variability. For these purposes, 10 Hz water vapor, temperature, and wind velocity data have been obtained at the Koshin Observatory located near the center of Lake Kasumigaura, the second largest lake in Japan (220 km 2 with mean depth of 4 m) since June of 2007. The corresponding fluxes were determined by applying the eddy correlation method to estimate the bulk coefficients. Agreement and disagreement with previous studies on the bulk transfer coefficients were identified. Also, the influence of lake current, wave, gustiness was investigated. Based on the derived functional form for the bulk coefficient, horizontal distribution of latent heat flux was estimated by first deriving a 100 -m grid map of air temperature, wind speed and humidity over the lake area from interpolation of the observed data at meteorological stations in and around Lake Kasumigaura. The bulk method was then applied to each grid to derive latent heat flux every six hours over a year, by assuming the same surface temperature as that at the Koshin Observatory. This was acceptable as the satellite infrared images indicated the presence of quasi-uniform surface water temperature, presumably to reflect well-mixed water body of the shallow lake. The results indicate larger fluxes at the lake center with smaller values near lake shores, mainly to reflect wind speed differences. In comparison, humidity and air temperature is of lessor importance to cause latent heat variability. The mean evaporation over the entire lake surface was found to be 976 (± 56) mm/y, while that at the Koshin observatory was 878 mm/y. 1 _mia 0 euq...|$|E

Intermittent operation of the water pump was also investigated and found to be beneficial to the system in terms of reduction in energy associated with the pump operation, and also prevention of water buildup in the flutes of the pad. Studies on water quality shows that water of high salinity (up to 35 ppt), and turbidity (up to 30 NTU) did not affect the evaporative cooling process, over the duration of usage. However, it is expected that over time, accumulation of salts, or other foreign materials on the pad surface will reduce the pad performance. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{environmental}} conditions both on the behaviour of fengycin at the air-aqueous interface and on its interaction with DPPC was studied using surface pressure-area isotherms and AFM. The ionisation state of fengycin is at the origin of its monolayer interfacial properties. The most organised interfacial arrangement is obtained when fengycin behaves as if having zero net charge (pH 2). In a fully ionised state (pH 7. 4), the organisation and the stability of fengycin monolayers depend on the ionic strength in the subphase. This can modulate the surface potential of fengycin and consequently the electrostatic repulsions inside the interfacial monolayer, {{as well as the}} lipopeptide interaction with the layer of water molecules forming the <b>air-water</b> interface. Intermolecular <b>interactions</b> of fengycin with DPPC are also strongly affected by the ionisation state of lipopeptide and the surface pressure (Pi) of the monolayer. A better miscibility between both interfacial components is observed at pH 2, while negatively charged lipopeptide molecules are segregated from the DPPC phase. A progressive desorption of fengycin from the interface is observed at pH 7. 4 when Pi increases while at pH 2, fengycin desorption brutally occurs when Pi rises above Pi value of the intermediate plateau.

40|$|Water {{has several}} unique {{physical}} and chemical properties that have influenced Life as it has evolved. Indeed the very concept of Life on the Earth is dependent on water supply. Although the total volume of fresh water on Earth is {{only a small fraction of}} that in the oceans, the biological and environmental role of freshwater systems is considerable. Environmental management of water systems (rivers, lakes, seas) is therefore a necessity to sustain economical development despite the technical challenges. Scientific methodology is based primarily upon the application of basic fluid mechanics to complex systems involving two- and possibly three-phase flows : e. g., sediment transport (watersolid), air-sea <b>interactions</b> (<b>air-water).</b> The writer proves the role of environmental fluid mechanics in gaining a sound understanding of water systems and in solving environmental problems. This is illustrated for a complete catchment system. That is, from upstream to downstream, the problem of reservoir sedimentation, stream re-oxygenation with instream aeration cascades, the impact of tidal bores on estuarine systems and the contribution of breaking waves to airsea mass transfer. In each case, the complexity of the problem is shown and new technological advances are described highlighting the essential role of environmental fluid mechanics. The management of water systems is extremely complex because of a combination of factors including Man 2 ̆ 7 s dependence on water, the geometric scale of water systems (up to 1 E+ 7 km 2), the range of relevant time scales (from less than 1 -s to over 1 E+ 9 -s), and the complexity of the governing equations (non-linearity) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to use {{state of the art}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics techniques {{to solve the problem of}} water-wind waves which are related to air-sea interaction. In general, air-sea interaction is studied in a de-coupled manner where both air and water phases are separate and the water phase is either considered as a smooth or rough wall which is stationary or moving. However, in real ocean waves the air and water are coupled. Mass, momentum, heat and energy exchange takes place mostly on the surface waves and this process is culminated when the waves break. Numerical modelling to study these processes requires the solution of the full Navier-Stokes equations along with capturing the interface boundary of the wave with high accuracy, thereby helping us to understand the physical processes taking place on the air-water interface and improve current wave modelling techniques. Our primary motivation is two fold: (1) to investigate the accuracy and reliability of the state of the art numerical techniques available for simulating free surface flows and model <b>air-water</b> wave <b>interaction</b> and (2) to study various near surface physical processes taking place at the transient, viscous, rotational and nonlinear air-water wave interface and understand its effects on the momentum and energy exchange in wind waves. The work presented in this thesis investigates a numerical model to solve the full Navier Stokes equations required to model transient, viscous, rotational and nonlinear water waves. The first step in the process is to model the water waves when the average wind speed is zero. Various other physical aspects related to wave dynamics are discussed for intermediate depth and deep water waves with different steepnesses. They are compared with earlier experimental and theoretical works available in order to verify the accuracy of the model. The second step is to model these water waves in the presence of wind blowing at different speeds and analyze its effects on various near surface physical properties and its effect on the motions in the air and underlying water. The other purpose of this thesis is to investigate some very interesting aspects related to wave dynamics such as vorticity and shear stress which are little studied due to complexities surrounding near surface flow measurements and the lack of an accurate analytical solution. The current work provides a tool for the application of CFD techniques to reliably predict wind-wave interaction by using numerical modelling techniques used in multi-phase flow environments. The accuracy and convergence of the numerical technique used in this thesis is illustrated by comparing the numerical results with analytical and theoretical results available. The technique is demonstrated to be accurate in the simulation of twodimensional flows where turbulent effects are negligible. At higher wind speeds, the use of suitable turbulence closure models is recommended. The main conclusions drawn from the study are: (1) accurate simulation of two and three dimensional, unsteady, viscous and nonlinear water waves is possible with current CFD techniques; (2) The role played by shear stress and vorticity in the wind wave interaction is important and cannot be ignored; (3) the vertical velocity gradients observed inside the water in intermediate depth water waves are found to be stronger than deep water waves; and (4) the effect of the bottom boundary on the magnitude of free surface vorticity is not found to be high. ...|$|R
