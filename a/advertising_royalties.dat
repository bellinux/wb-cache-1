One episode in season three did not include a vacation because a family's daughter was in isolation at a local hospital. As the family took vacation, they received video messages via computer laptop from Pennington's camera. The videos displayed on the laptop were superimposed on broadcasts to avoid both screen glare and the requirement of paying <b>advertising</b> <b>royalties</b> on the software used in the videos.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{motivation}} for this paper {{arises from the}} importance of stakeholder communications for firms and the rapid emergence of social media networks {{as a means of}} such communications. Our purpose is to understand the early adoption and use of social media networks for such communications by firms. Specifically, we examine the use of Facebook (the most popular social networking site) by franchisors and focus on two questions: (1) antecedents of early adoption of Facebook by franchisors, mainly in terms of system age, size, organizational form, <b>advertising</b> <b>royalty</b> rates, industry, and internationalization, and (2) variations in use of Facebook (in terms of content) by these franchisors and the way these variations relate to the characteristics of the franchisors and their systems. Our empirical study covers 408 franchisors doing business in the French market. The analysis approach is quantitative, with the use of t-tests and Levene tests, Pearson chi-square tests and a logistic regression model, as well as a content analysis of the franchisors' Facebook pages. At the time we collected data, we found that only 21. 3 per cent of the franchisors had a presence on Facebook. Several characteristics of the system (for example, percentage of company-owned outlets, <b>advertising</b> <b>royalty</b> rates, industry) influence whether a franchisor has a presence on Facebook as well as the nature of content on the relevant Facebook page. We draw on organizational theories (resource-based theory) and institutional economic theories (agency theory) to explain these results. These research findings can help the franchisors to better understand the role of social media networks for stakeholder communications...|$|R

Our purpose is to understand the early adoption and use of social media networks for such communications by firms at a point in time when such networks were relatively new. Specifically, we examine the adoption and use of Facebook (the most popular social networking site) by franchisors and focus on two questions: (1) antecedents of early adoption of Facebook by franchisors, mainly in terms of system age, size, organizational form, <b>advertising</b> <b>royalty</b> rates, industry, and internationalization, and (2) variations in use of Facebook (in terms of content) by these franchisors and the way these variations relate to the characteristics of the franchisors and their systems.

We draw on organizational theories and institutional economic theories to offer potential explanations for our preliminary investigation. These research findings can help the franchisors better understand the role of social media networks for stakeholder communications. In particular, our results offer insights for smaller franchisors, in terms of when and how they adopt communication innovations to compete against larger firms...|$|R
5000|$|There are a {{great deal}} of die-hard, unfounded myths {{surrounding}} these decorations such as their usage as amulets to ward off the [...] "evil eye". The most popular size is 3 × 3½ inches of flat brass with a hanger by which the brass is threaded onto a horse harness strap, known as a Martingale. In England many of these items of harness found their way into country public houses as the era of the heavy horse declined, and are still associated today as a pub decoration. By the late 19th century heavy horses were decorated with brasses of all kinds and sizes. During this era working horse parades were popular throughout the British Isles and prize or merit awards were given, some by the Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). Horse brasses were often highly prized by the [...] "carters", who decorated their horse with them. Other horse brass subjects include <b>advertising,</b> <b>royalty</b> commemoration, and in later years, souvenir brasses for places and events, many of which are still being made and used today.|$|R

Cockerham also managed day-to-day music licensing for film, TV <b>advertising,</b> and <b>royalties</b> collections. In 2006, he co-produced Hard Rock International's SERVE2 project - a compilation album featuring previously unreleased tracks from Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Jackson Browne, Joss Stone and other influential artists - to benefit WhyHunger, distributed through The Orchard via iTunes.|$|R
50|$|Bingo Nelson (Dick Powell), a pilot {{famous for}} {{performing}} crazy stunts, immediately {{falls in love}} when he spots the photograph in his friend Click's suite. After heroically flying to Alaska through a blizzard to deliver serum for some sick children, he proposes to Dawn Glory on national radio. As a result, reporters clamor to interview the woman, putting Click in a tough spot. Slattery (Lyle Talbot) of the Express is particularly persistent, digging up Click's checkered past to try to blackmail him into giving him an exclusive interview. Finally, Click is about to admit the truth when Ed's girlfriend Gladys Russell (Mary Astor) discovers Loretta trying on a dress delivered for Miss Glory. Earlier in the day, Loretta had splurged and gotten her hair styled as in the photograph. Gladys and Ed pass off Loretta as Dawn. Soon, <b>advertising</b> endorsements and <b>royalties</b> make Click and Ed a lot of money.|$|R

While the number of traffic accident deaths of passengers in cars has decreased sharply over the years, the number of pedestrian deaths has remained relatively high, overtaking the number of passenger deaths in 2009 to be the top contributor to traffic accident deaths in Japan. In yet other statistical survey, it is revealed that the main cause of traffic accidents in Japan can be attributed to the lack of due consideration to safety on the part of drivers, whereas the fault of pedestrians as a cause of traffic accidents only takes up a small percentage. The above lend evidence that "pedestrian deaths" as a societal problem has not been adequately addressed and that the safety consideration of drivers needs to be looked into. Our design project thus hopes to come up with an appropriate recommendation, while meeting the requirements of our project sponsor, Suzuki Motor Corporation, which hopes to develop its own automobile software that can contribute to the realization of a safer mobility system for society. A myriad of tools were used in creating the final solution. Through VOX benchmarking, we found out that there was strong emphasis on using hardware innovation to reduce the number of traffic accidents while there was little competition in the field of automobile safety software. We also talked to the key stakeholders (drivers and pedestrians) and found that dimly-lit roads and road intersections were examples of what, to them, constituted as danger on the roads. Scenario Graph and Use Case taught us that software for drivers and that for pedestrians should have slightly differentiated functions. CVCA was especially helpful when devising our business model that relies on both <b>advertising</b> revenue and <b>royalty</b> fees. QFD showed us that the most important solution element was software (relative weight of 20 %). FMEA taught us that to just rely on users as the only source of information of dangerous locations may pose a high risk to the usefulness of the system,whereas rototyping gave us a means of visualizing the "final" form of our product. Through financial evaluation, we calculated that the NPV at a rate of return of 15 % is $ 8489000. We thus recommend a car navigation software that makes use of a unified safety map for both drivers and pedestrians in order to realize a safer mobility system for society. Lack of funding is a probable risk factor that can hinder the progress of our project and should it occur, we would have to launch our product on an even smaller scale in the early stages to mitigate the risk...|$|R
