40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>African</b> <b>American</b> English <b>and</b> slang are {{now become}} {{interesting}} topics among linguists for its unique characteristics and usage in daily society as vernacular language. This paper analyses {{the use of}} <b>African</b> <b>American</b> English <b>and</b> slang used by an <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> a Caucasian <b>American</b> in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn novel. Findings propose that <b>African</b> <b>American</b> English <b>and</b> slang are particulary used by <b>African</b> <b>American</b> speakers as their daily language, but non <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> may choose this variety as their language choice...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine if verve had any impact on the {{academic}} achievement of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> middle school students. The three guiding questions of this research were: 1. Is there a significant difference in the verve levels between <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European <b>American</b> students? 2. Is there a significant difference in verve levels of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> male <b>and</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> female students in middle school? 3. Is there a significant difference in the academic achievement of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European <b>American</b> students who possess high and low verve in the areas of reading and math? A 24 -item questionnaire was administered to 211 middle school students to determine if any verve levels were present, and if so, to what degree did the verve levels impact academic performance? The findings were: 1. The verve levels were different between the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> the European <b>American</b> students. The <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students in this study possessed higher amounts of verve. 2. The verve levels were different between the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> males <b>and</b> the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> females. The <b>African</b> <b>American</b> females in this study had higher amounts of verve than the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> males. 3. There was no relationship between the higher verve levels among the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European <b>American</b> students <b>and</b> their academic achievement in reading and math...|$|R

5|$|During {{the post-war}} Reconstruction era, Virginia adopted a {{constitution}} which provided for free public schools, and guaranteed political, civil, and voting rights. The populist Readjuster Party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white Democratic Party gained power after 1883. It passed segregationist Jim Crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the Constitution of Virginia {{to include a}} poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disfranchised most <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> many poor European Americans. Though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded {{due to a lack}} of political representation, African Americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in Virginia society.|$|E
5|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{features}} elaborate sound collages {{that incorporate}} varying rhythms, numerous samples, media sound bites, and eccentric loops, reflecting the songs' confrontational tone. Recorded during {{the golden age}} of hip hop, its assemblage of reconfigured and recontextualized aural sources preceded the sample clearance system that later emerged in the music industry. Fear of a Black Planet explores themes about organization and empowerment within the black community, social issues affecting <b>African</b> <b>Americans,</b> <b>and</b> race relations at the time. The record's criticism of institutional racism, White supremacy, and the power elite was partly inspired by Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's views on color.|$|E

5|$|Hispanic Americans, also {{referred}} to as Latinos, served in all elements of the American armed forces in the war. They fought in every major American battle in the war. Between 250,000 and 500,000 Hispanic Americans served in the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II, {{out of a total of}} 12,000,000, constituting 2.3% to 4.7% of the U.S. Armed Forces. The exact number is unknown as, at the time, Hispanics were not tabulated separately, but were generally included in the general white population census count. Separate statistics were kept for <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> Asian Americans.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Gottesman {{was called}} before the United States Senate by senator Walter Mondale {{to discuss the}} then 15-point IQ gap {{separating}} <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> white Americans. Gottesman testified that genes influenced IQ, but only in conjunction with elements such as schooling, money, and nutritious food from childhood onwards. In 2003, he and colleagues published a study showing that heritability was higher for IQ differences within high socioeconomic status (SES) people than among low SES people, i.e., genes influenced differences between children's test scores more among high SES than among low SES children.|$|E

5|$|Though widely {{respected}} in her later years, Roosevelt was a controversial First Lady {{at the time}} for her outspokenness, particularly her stance on racial issues. She was the first presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences, write a daily newspaper column, write a monthly magazine column, host a weekly radio show, and speak at a national party convention. On a few occasions, she publicly disagreed with her husband's policies. She launched an experimental community at Arthurdale, West Virginia, {{for the families of}} unemployed miners, later widely regarded as a failure. She advocated for expanded roles for women in the workplace, the civil rights of <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> Asian Americans, and the rights of World War II refugees.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil Rights Movement {{challenging}} the restrictions and discrimination practiced against blacks exercise of constitutional rights, a series of US Supreme Court cases, beginning with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the 24th Amendment, and federal legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had overturned the most controversial aspects of the 1902 Constitution – the provisions restricting voting by <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> mandating school segregation. Combined with the election of Governor Mills Godwin in 1965, there was impetus for governmental change. Godwin strongly advocated the loosening of the strict constitutional restrictions on state-issued bonds and borrowing, and used his power and popularity to push for a new constitution. In 1968 a joint resolution of the Virginia General Assembly approved a new commission, chaired by former Governor Albertis Harrison, to revise the constitution.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} effective recruitment and retention initiatives for <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> Hispanic teachers. The research examined recruitment and retention initiatives used by school districts utilizing a survey instrument administered to a sample population of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> Hispanic teachers within selected school districts in Texas. The sample population of 335 <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> Hispanic teachers was asked to provide their knowledge and perception of recruitment and retention initiatives that were relevant to them in their employment with a school district. The results of the survey instrument were examined for the similarities and differences in the recruitment and retention initiatives for <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> Hispanic teacher populations as perceived by the sample population of teachers. The subjects of this research study were <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> Hispanic teachers employed in school districts with a teacher population of at least seven percent of both <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> Hispanic teachers and a student population of at least 10, 000 students reported to the Texas Education Agency. There were fourteen school districts selected based on this criteria, and four school districts agreed to participate in the study. Based on the findings of the study, the researcher??s recommendations include: (1) The top recruitment initiatives for <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> Hispanic candidates are humanistic factors: contribution to humanity and helping young people. Recruiters should emphasize these areas along with the location of job and financial assistance programs offered by the school districts to improved recruitment. (2) Attention should be given to the establishment of programs that focus on introducing the education profession to students in the middle school and high school settings. (3) Job satisfaction and job security are leading retention initiatives for <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> Hispanic teacher which can be accomplished by improving working conditions and increasing administrative support in a school district. (4) Provide opportunities for increased parental communication, participation and involvement in the school system to help increase retention with <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> Hispanic teachers. (5) Further study could determine if there is a relationship between the effective recruitment and retention initiatives and the years of experience of teachers...|$|R
