25|$|With Confinity, Thiel {{realized}} they could develop a software {{to solve a}} gap in making online payments. Although the use of credit cards and expanding <b>automated</b> <b>teller</b> <b>machine</b> networks provided consumers with more available payment options, not all merchants could gain the necessary hardware to accept credit cards. Thus, consumers were often left with little choice and instead had to pay with exact cash or personal checks.

In 1981 a chapel was founded on the Zugspitze, which was consecrated by the Archbishop of Munich and Freising, Joseph Ratzinger, in October on the feast of Visitation. On 25 March, an <b>automated</b> <b>teller</b> <b>machine</b> was installed at the summit station; it has since been removed. In 1995, a 450 square metre exhibition area was opened at the summit, in which artists present their work for six months, before the exhibition is changed.

Additionally, in 1990 company scientists used a scanning tunneling microscope to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms to spell out the company acronym, marking the first structure assembled one atom at a time. A major part of IBM research is the generation of patents. Since its first patent for a traffic signaling device, IBM {{has been one of}} the world's most prolific patent sources.

25|$|An <b>automated</b> <b>teller</b> <b>machine</b> (ATM) is a {{computerized}} telecommunications device {{that provides the}} clients of a financial institution with access to financial transactions in a public space {{without the need for}} a cashier, human clerk or bank teller. ATMs are known by various other names including automatic banking machine, cash machine, and various regional variants derived from trademarks on ATM systems held by particular banks. Financial transcationssuch as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers of accounts may be conducted at ATM's by inserting an ATM card. In 1939, Armenian-American inventor Luther George Simjian initially {{came up with the idea}} of creating a hole-in-the-wall machine that would allow customers to make financial transactions. The idea was met with a great deal of skepticism after Citicorp tested it. In later years and after Simjian filed 20 patents related to the device, the idea and the gradual usage of ATM's became more widespread around the world.|$|E

500|$|Chemical {{was among}} the pioneers of {{electronic}} online banking. [...] On September 2, 1969, Chemical installed the first <b>automated</b> <b>teller</b> <b>machine</b> (ATM) at its branch in Rockville Centre, New York. [...] The first ATMs were designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a specially coded card. [...] A Chemical Bank advertisement boasted [...] "On Sept. 2 our bank will open at 9:00 and never close again." [...] Chemical's ATM, initially known as a Docuteller, was designed by Donald Wetzel and his company Docutel. [...] Chemical executives were initially hesitant about the electronic banking transition given {{the high cost of}} the early machines. [...] Additionally, executives were concerned that customers would resist having machines handling their money.|$|E

500|$|The {{player can}} {{press a button}} to have Ninten [...] "check" [...] or [...] "talk" [...] with nearby people, animals, and objects.

The members of Ninten's party are all visible on the overworld screen at once, and are analogous to EarthBound party members in style and function.

500|$|The {{series is}} known for its {{combination}} of humorous and emotionally evocative tones.

While Mother 3 music is both similar in tone to its predecessors and completely new, it features similar sound effects. EarthBound characters such as Mr. Saturn recur, and RPGamer wrote that Mother 3 final chapter is [...] "full of blatant links" [...] between the games of the series. Mother also shares similarities with its sequel, such as the game save option through phoning Ninten's father, an option to store items with Ninten's sister at home, and an <b>automated</b> <b>teller</b> <b>machine</b> for banking money.
