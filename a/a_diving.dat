5|$|<b>A</b> <b>diving</b> {{cylinder}}, scuba tank or {{diving tank}} is a gas cylinder used to store and transport the high pressure breathing gas required by a scuba set. It {{may also be}} used for surface-supplied diving or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or scuba. Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> regulator or the breathing loop of <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> rebreather.|$|E
5|$|Intimidator {{features}} eight drops, seven camelback hills, {{a panoramic}} u-turn, and <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> spiral. One cycle lasts about 3 minutes and 33 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{low price}} and {{convenience}} of many modern dive computers mean that many recreational divers only use tables {{such as the}} RDP {{for a short time}} during training before moving on to use <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> computer.|$|E
50|$|Final: 28 August — Each diver {{performed}} <b>a</b> front <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> back <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> reverse <b>dive,</b> <b>an</b> inward <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> twisting <b>dive</b> and <b>an</b> armstand <b>dive,</b> all {{limited in}} difficulty degree.

The 18 divers {{with the highest}} total score advanced to the semi-final.|$|R
50|$|Final: 22 August — Each diver {{performed}} five <b>dives</b> out of <b>a</b> group {{consisting of}} <b>a</b> front <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> back <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> reverse <b>dive,</b> <b>an</b> inward <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> twisting <b>dive</b> and <b>an</b> armstand <b>dive.</b> The final ranking {{was determined by}} the combined score from the final and semi-final dives.|$|R
5|$|There are two {{commonly}} used conventions for describing {{the capacity of}} <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> cylinder. One {{is based on the}} internal volume of the cylinder. The other is based on nominal volume of gas stored.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>diving</b> stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. <b>A</b> <b>diving</b> stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted {{out of the water and}} returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E
5|$|A valve failed on a diver’s {{emergency}} cylinder on <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> {{support vessel}} during {{preparation for a}} dive injuring five divers. The cylinder valve was ejected at 180 bar due to incompatible thread. Pillar valve was M25x2 parallel thread and cylinder was a 3/4″x14 BSP parallel thread.|$|E
50|$|Semi-final: 28 August — Each diver {{performed}} four <b>dives</b> out of <b>a</b> group {{consisting of}} <b>a</b> front <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> back <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> reverse <b>dive,</b> <b>an</b> inward <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> twisting <b>dive</b> and <b>an</b> armstand <b>dive.</b> The 12 divers {{with the highest}} combined score from the semi-final and preliminary dives advanced to the final.|$|R
50|$|Preliminary round: 21 August — Each diver {{performed}} five <b>dives</b> out of <b>a</b> group {{consisting of}} <b>a</b> front <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> back <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> reverse <b>dive,</b> <b>an</b> inward <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> twisting <b>dive</b> and <b>an</b> armstand <b>dive.</b> There were no limitations in degree of difficulty.

50|$|Preliminary round: 23 August — Each diver {{performed}} <b>a</b> front <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> back <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> reverse <b>dive,</b> <b>an</b> inward <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> twisting <b>dive</b> and <b>a</b> sixth free-choice <b>dive</b> {{from one}} of these groups. There were no limitations in degree of difficulty. The 18 divers with the highest total score advanced to the semi-final.|$|R
5|$|A wet bell, or open bell, {{is similar}} to <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> stage in concept, but has an air space, open to the water at the bottom in which the divers, or at least their heads, can shelter during ascent and descent.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{an annual}} visual {{inspection}} {{is not required}} by the USA DOT, though they do require a hydrostatic test every five years. The visual inspection requirement is <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> industry standard based on observations made during a review by the National Underwater Accident Data Center.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} match of the tournament, Bam Bam Bigelow got the early {{advantage}} by attacking Razor Ramon from behind. Ramon gained momentum after Bigelow missed <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> headbutt, but Bigelow used {{his strength and}} got Ramon in a torture rack. As Bigelow climbed the ropes, however, Ramon threw {{him back into the}} ring and scored the pinfall.|$|E

5|$|Miller bowled Dewes for {{one with}} his second ball to leave England at 2/1, before Johnston removed Edrich for three to leave England at 10/2. Lindwall {{dismissed}} Compton after Morris had taken <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> catch, and Miller then removed Crapp without scoring after a 23-ball innings, leaving England at 23/4.|$|E
5|$|Open circuit scuba systems {{discharge}} {{the breathing}} gas {{into the environment}} as it is exhaled, and consist {{of one or more}} diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high pressure which is supplied to the diver through <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> regulator. They may include additional cylinders for decompression gas or emergency breathing gas.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} pressure of <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> cylinder is measured at several stages during use. It is checked before filling, monitored during filling and checked when filling is completed. This {{can all be}} done with the pressure gauge on the filling equipment.|$|E
50|$|Preliminary round: 25 August — Each diver {{performed}} <b>a</b> front <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> back <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> reverse <b>dive,</b> <b>an</b> inward <b>dive</b> and <b>a</b> twisting <b>dive.</b> There were no {{limitations in}} degree of difficulty.

50|$|Semi-final: 24 August — Each diver {{performed}} <b>a</b> front <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> back <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> reverse <b>dive,</b> <b>an</b> inward <b>dive</b> and <b>a</b> twisting <b>dive.</b> The overall difficulty degree {{was limited}} to 9.5. The 12 divers with the highest combined score from the semi-final and preliminary dives advanced to the final.|$|R
5|$|Recreational diving paper logbooks {{frequently}} {{provide a}} simple graphic representation of <b>a</b> <b>dive</b> profile for recording {{the details of}} <b>a</b> <b>dive</b> which are necessary for planning <b>a</b> repetitive <b>dive</b> using <b>a</b> specified set of dive tables.|$|R
5|$|The teams {{played out}} a {{draw in the}} third match at Manchester, where Tallon {{dismissed}} George Emmett from the bowling of Ray Lindwall with <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> one-handed catch. He also dropped Compton three times, allowing the English batsman to go from 50 to 145 not out as he held the hosts' first innings together.|$|E
5|$|While this {{duty was}} {{relatively}} uneventful, Balch did twice encounter German submarines. On 29 January 1918, while steaming off Liverpool, she dropped two depth charges over <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> U-boat, without effect. Then, on 12 May, the destroyer joined other escorts in depth-charging a U-boat spotted near convoy HS 60, with Balch dropping 12 depth charges that helped drive off the submarine.|$|E
5|$|A simple {{record of}} depth {{and time for}} a dive is useful as a legal record of <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> operation, where this is required, {{and in the case}} of an {{accident}} during the dive, an accurately recorded dive profile can provide useful diagnostic information for treatment of the injured diver and for analysis of the circumstances leading to the accident and the action taken during and after the incident. A proposed dive profile is necessary for effective dive planning, both for estimating the required breathing gas composition and quantities, for planning decompression, and for choosing suitable diving equipment and other logistical aspects.|$|E

50|$|Live in <b>a</b> <b>Dive</b> is <b>a</b> live album by Californian {{punk rock}} band Swingin' Utters. Released in 2004, {{it is the}} sixth in the Live in <b>a</b> <b>Dive</b> series.|$|R
6000|$|... "If it wasn't so cold {{a fellow}} could take <b>a</b> <b>dive</b> and find out," [...] said Shep. [...] "But I don't want <b>a</b> <b>dive</b> in such water as that," [...] {{and the others}} agreed with him.|$|R
5|$|A wet bell, or open bell, {{is similar}} to <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> stage in concept, but has an air space, open to the water at the bottom in which the divers, or at least their heads, can shelter during ascent and descent. A wet bell {{provides}} more comfort and control than a stage and allows for longer time in the water. Wet bells are used for air and mixed gas, and divers can decompress using oxygen from a mask at 12m.|$|E
5|$|Before his {{match with}} Bret Hart, Lawler {{introduced}} a woman obviously younger than himself as his mother, and wished her a happy Mother's Day. Moments before the contest, Hart revealed that his knee injury was fake. During the contest, referee Earl Hebner became tied {{upside down in}} the ropes after being distracted by Shinja. While Hebner was tied upside down, Hakushi interfered and performed <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> headbutt to Hart. Lawler won the match when he rolled-up Hart for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{pay-per-view}} began, Shane Douglas defeated Buddy Rose {{in a dark}} match. Hercules attacked Shawn Michaels {{prior to}} the first televised bout, hitting him in the knee with a chain. Although his partner was unable to compete, Jannetty controlled {{the beginning of the}} match, using hip tosses to throw Roma and Hercules. Power and Glory then attacked Jannetty while their manager, Slick, distracted the referee. Although Jannetty was able to mount a brief comeback, Roma and Hercules wore him down and got the victory after performing a PowerPlex—a superplex from Hercules followed by <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> splash from Roma.|$|E
