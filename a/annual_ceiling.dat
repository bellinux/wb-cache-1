30|$|As part of {{a package}} of fiscal {{stimulus}} measures in 2009, the government announced 850 billion RMB ($ 136 billion) in new health sector spending, spread among the urban and rural insurance schemes (National Development and Reform Commission 2009).

30|$|Starting in the mid- 2000 s, the Chinese {{government}} began to increase spending on healthcare, mostly to expand insurance coverage {{but also for}} biomedical infrastructure of hospitals and research facilities (Barber and Yao 2011). A series of pilot projects begun in 300 rural counties in 2003 subsequently evolved into the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) {{on the national level}} (Zhang et al. 2010). Restricted to rural participants, NCMS offers very basic subsidized insurance to households. At its origin, a typical insured member paid an annual contribution of 10 RMB ($ 1.60)b, with additional contributions by the central and local governments of 20 RMB each; premiums and coverage subsequently rose, though only modestly. Administration of NCMS and coverage decisions are the responsibility of local governments, who manage budgets by setting reimbursement limits. At present, coverage is limited to inpatient care and <b>annual</b> <b>ceilings</b> per patient are used to control expenditures. In 2012, the government set a common formula for coverage limits of eight times average annual farm income, but not less than 60, 000 RMB ($ 9, 600). NCMS operates on a local basis, and deductibles and copayments typically increase for treatment away from home (Brown and Theoharides 2009).|$|R

40|$|The European Council {{agreed on}} the new {{medium-term}} planning for financing the European Union be-tween 2007 and 2013 in December 2005. 1 The finan-cial planning involves decisions on the level and structure of future expenditure and on the rules how this expenditure is to be financed. EU expenditure The <b>annual</b> <b>ceiling</b> for EU budget expenditure (“payment appropriations”) is currently 1. 24 {{percent of the gross}} national income (GNI) of all member states. The member states ’ financial contributions can be set and collected only up to this amount. In 2004 the total sum actually spent amounted to p 100. 1 billion, which, as in previous years, was 0. 98 percent of GNI, significantly less than the <b>annual</b> <b>ceiling</b> (Tables 1 and 2). While this represents a 10. 6 percent increase in total expenditure compared with that of 2003, most of the increase was due to the EU enlargement on 1 May 2004. Almost 7. 5 percentage points of the growth of nearly 11 percent of the allo-cable expenditure burden shared by the individual member states were due to the new member states. 2 However, the increase in expenditure resulting from enlargement was considerably restricted by virtue of an agreement on transition regulations. For example, a ceiling of p 22 billion was set for structural aid to the new member states for the years between 2004 and 2006. Moreover, the farmers there received just 25 percent of the usual direct payments in the first year (30 percent in 2005). The full amount of finan-cial support will not be paid until the end of a transi-tional period of ten years. 3 Expenditure may be subdivided into three main cat-egories (Figure 1).

40|$|Background: China has {{achieved}} universal health insurance coverage. This study examined how patients and hospitals {{react to the}} different designs of the plans and to monitoring of patients by the local authority in the Chinese multiple health security schemes. Methods: The sample for analysis consisted of 1006 orthopedic inpatients who were admitted between January and December 2011 at a tertiary teaching hospital located in Beijing. We conducted general linear regression analyses to investigate whether medical expenditure and length of stay differed according to the different incentives. Results: Patients under plans with lower copayment rates consumed significantly more medication compared with those under plans with higher copayment rates. Under plans with an <b>annual</b> <b>ceiling</b> for insurance coverage, patients spent significantly more {{in the second half}} of the year than in the first half of the year.

40|$|In October 2000, Congress {{passed the}} "American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000 " (AC 21). Responding to tight labor markets and burgeoning demand for highly skilled workers, {{particularly}} in the information technology sector (IT), large bipartisan majorities voted to increase the <b>annual</b> <b>ceiling</b> on temporary "specialty worker" (H- 1 B) visas. AC 21 raises the number of H- 1 B visas from 115, 000 to 195, 000 {{for each of the}} next three fiscal years. This was the second large increase since 1998, when the limit was only 65, 000. (See Figure 1.) The ceiling reverts to 65, 000 in 2004. The recent strong demand for temporary workers reflects not only a booming IT industry, but also a failing permanent visa system. Temporary H- 1 B visas are generally approved in two to four months, while the wait for permanent employment visas now averages four and one half years. Although many employers would prefer to hire permanent workers, they cannot operate with such delays. They therefore have turned to the temporary visa system to fill permanent positions and meet their growing demand for skilled labor...|$|E
40|$|Our {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the impact of tax reductions on the demand for services in the home. For that purpose, we consider the particular case of the French legislation voted in 1991. This law allows households employing paid help in the home to deduct from their income tax 50 % of the sums paid out, subject to an <b>annual</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Did the reduction in overall cost of jobs in the form of services to individuals stimulate the household demand for these services? To analyse this problem, we estimate a structural model of demand for in-home services by using household individual data collected by INSEE (Paris) in 1996. Our estimations show that the relative marginal effect of a price variation on the probability of a strictly positive demand for in-home services is negative; its absolute value decreases with the educational level and with the income level of the household. It is generally higher for households without children less than 6 years old. These results suggest that a differentiated tax reduction, varying with the household income level and with the presence of young children in the household, should have a higher effect on the demand for in-home services than a uniform tax credit, such as the one granted in France since 1991.
