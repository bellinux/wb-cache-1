40|$|AbstractThe {{level of}} {{reduction}} of cytochrome a and cua during the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c {{has been determined}} in stopped-flow experiments. Both components are partially reduced but become progressively more oxidized as the reaction proceeds. When all cytochrome c has been oxidized, cua is also completely oxidized, whereas cytochrome a is still partially reduced. These results can be simulated {{on the basis of}} a model which requires that the intramolecular electron transfer from cytochrome a and cua to cytochrome a 3 -Cub is a two-electron process and, in addition, that the binding of oxidized cytochrome c to the electron-transfer site decreases the rate constants for intramolecular electron transfer from cytochrome <b>a.</b> The <b>first</b> <b>requirement</b> is related to the function of the oxidase as a proton pump. Product dissociation is not by itself rate-limiting, making it less likely that the source of the nonhyperbolic substrate kinetics is an effect on this step from electrostatic interaction with ferricytochrome c bound to a second site.

40|$|This {{study was}} to examine whether {{grinding}} of an insoluble fertilizer to different degrees of fineness produced a limit below which further grinding did not accelerate solution of the particles.

Mixing fine particles with coarser ones could improve the situation, but the percentage of coarse particles should not be too high. Grinding natural phosphates to colloidal fineness was useless, since the colloidal state was lost during drying of the product.
