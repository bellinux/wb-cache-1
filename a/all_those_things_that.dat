[...] He goes on to say that in the video [...] "All Ush wants to do is make it back to her, to do <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> husbands and wives tend to do. The only problem is he can't." [...] At the end of the video, Lenoir has enough, and walks out. Montgomery notes that it is not clear whether Usher even makes it home, or if the song was even referring to the wife character, and not [...] "someone special stashed in a nearby suite." [...] In resolving the video's review, Montgomery said, [...] "Distance may make the heart grow fonder, but there are limits to everything. Usher may want to be no place but home, but there's a big, wide world out there with pitfalls aplenty. He's a superstar, a businessman, a father and an (ex-) husband, but at the end of the day, Ush is also human, and [...] "Hey Daddy" [...] is proof of that." [...] In a review of the video, Rap-Up said that [...] "Even though it’s been a minute since his last video, the ladies man still knows how to bust a move." ...|$|E

[...] Paisley {{has stated that}} he watched Williams' {{performance}} and thought [...] "She seems like a great girl — smart and funny and <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are so hard to find." [...] In 2002, Williams appeared in a video for the song [...] "I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song)", the last release from his Part II album. The two married on March 15, 2003, at Stauffer Chapel {{on the campus of}} Pepperdine University after a nine-month engagement. They live in Franklin, Tennessee, and had another home in Pacific Palisades that was sold in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|As {{noted by}} {{journalist}} Ilie Ighel in Familia, {{there was a}} swift transition from republicanism to socialism, effected {{when some of the}} old staff left Adevărul. He wrote: [...] " [...] a sinister character emerges, in the person of Anton Bacalbașa, the graduate of two gymnasium classes, along with other unknown celebrities [...] It is certain that such transitions from one stance to the other have disgusted the cultured public, giving birth to a deep resentment for this sheet that, once taken over by Anton Bacalbașa, did not embrace scientific socialism, [...] but proceeded to insult with brutality <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are notable in industry, commerce, finance". In retrospect, Constantin Bacalbașa also admitted that the socialist takeover was made possible because Alexandru Beldiman, the newspaper's owner, was [...] "weak-willed".|$|E

In an interview with RiffYou.com, Osborne reinforced his criticisms, stating [...] "I happen to know {{a lot of the stuff}} in the movie isn’t true.

He stood regarding her silently. Her cheeks and neck were red; there was a red tinge, too, in her eyelids, deepening the [...] "chicory-flower" [...] colour of her eyes.

2500|$|The review {{does offer}} one common {{reservation}} about the game: [...] "It doesn't lend itself easily to long-term campaign play.

6000|$|He remarked: “Just so. A man mourns {{only for}} his friends. I suppose {{they are no}} more friends to you than they are to me. Those Carlists make a great {{consumption}} of cartridges.

6000|$|I said, {{that when}} a man is wounded in his conscience, he {{naturally}} leaneth to {{the works of the}} law; wherefore thou must therefore be so much the more heedful to study the grace of God; yea, so to study it as rightly, not only in notion, but in thy practices, to distinguish it from the law. [...] "The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ" [...] (John 1:17).

60|$|Christ hath {{redeemed}} us {{from the}} curse of the law. Whatever the law can take hold of to curse us for, that Christ has redeemed us from, by being made a curse for us. But this curse that Christ was made for us, must be confined to his sufferings, not to his exaltation, and, consequently, not to his intercession, for Christ is made no curse but when he suffered; not in his intercession: so then, as he died he took away the curse, and sin that was the cause thereof, by the sacrifice of himself, (Gal 3:13), and by his life, his intercession, he saveth us from <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> attempt to bring us into that condemnation again.|$|E
40|$|What do we {{mean when}} we talk about events? Can we even (really) say we know what an ‘event’ is? To begin {{thinking}} about teaching in terms of the event is to begin thinking about <b>all</b> of <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> happen in our classrooms that we don’t and can’t control. Thinking the event means thinking about the unthinkable, the unforeseeable and ultimately the unknowable. It is about letting go of a concept – almost impossible to relinquish – that teaching and learning are transparent entities: understandable, limitable, predictable, something we can and do know about. Thinking about the event is thinking about what actually happens, not what we think should or ought to happen in our classrooms...|$|R

60|$|And {{the first}} is, Whether <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we suppose to be bred from {{corruption}} and putrifaction, {{may not be}} rationally suppos'd to have their origination as natural as these Gnats, who, 'tis very probable, were first dropt into this Water, {{in the form of}} Eggs. Those Seeds or Eggs must certainly be very small, which so small a creature as a Gnat yields, and therefore, we need not wonder that we find not the Eggs themselves, some of the younger of them, which I have observ'd, having not exceeded a tenth part of the bulk they have afterwards come to; and next, I have observed some of those little ones which must have been generated after the Water was inclosed in the Bottle, and therefore most probably from Eggs, whereas those creatures have been suppos'd to be bred of the corruption of the Water, there being not formerly known any probable way how they should be generated.|$|E

"This upward {{scramble}} was short, and we {{soon found}} ourselves tramping along a broad road of flat roofs, broader than many big thoroughfares, with chimney-pots {{here and there}} that seemed in the haze as bulky as small forts.

The sky and <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are commonly clear seemed overpowered by sinister spirits. Tall spectres with turbans of vapour seemed to stand higher than the sun or moon, eclipsing both. I thought dimly of illustrations to the `Arabian Nights' on brown paper with rich but sombre tints, showing genii gathering round the Seal of Solomon. By the way, what was the Seal of Solomon? Nothing to do with sealing-wax really, I suppose; but my muddled fancy felt the thick clouds as being of that heavy and clinging substance, of strong opaque colour, poured out of boiling pots and stamped into monstrous emblems.|$|E
