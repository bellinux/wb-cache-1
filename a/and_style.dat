40|$|Literature {{reveals a}} number of confusions within the area of project {{management}} {{regarding the use of}} terminology and differing interpretations, concerning leadership competencies <b>and</b> leadership <b>styles.</b> In project management literature, many empirical studies have examined the influence of leadership competencies or styles, but yet any substantial review study has rarely been conducted to differentiate between leadership competencies <b>and</b> <b>styles.</b> This study aims to differentiate between leadership competencies <b>and</b> leadership <b>styles</b> in project management literature. This study found that the project manager's leadership terms including competence, competency, competencies, <b>and</b> <b>styles</b> have frequently been used in project management literature. Furthermore, literature has been synthesized to provide more familiarity and understanding on leadership competencies <b>and</b> <b>styles.</b> Findings indicate that leadership competencies <b>and</b> <b>styles</b> are two different things but a few characteristics are common between both the terms. Furthermore, leadership competencies are more suitable for task-oriented activities <b>and</b> leadership <b>styles</b> are more appropriate for relationship-oriented factors. This study has implications for the future directions to identify differences between project manger's average and superior performance through comparison of leadership competencies <b>and</b> <b>styles...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore how PV powered {{products}} have been designed in the past. For this purpose we have drawn a historical time line of the design features of PV powered products {{in the context of}} main stream design <b>and</b> <b>styling.</b> Our time frame is 1970 till 2016, focusing in first instance on consumer products and PV powered lamps. We will discuss how we learn from these experiences for the design <b>and</b> <b>styling</b> of future PV powered products. Because design <b>and</b> <b>styling</b> {{is considered one of the}} key features to a well-designed product, this study is relevant for the acceptability of PV products in nowadays consumer markets. Despite many studies on the technical functioning and energy performance of PV powered products, little attention has been paid to a constructive analysis of design <b>and</b> <b>styling.</b> Therefore with this study we make a start with identifying which design <b>and</b> <b>styling</b> factors can contribute to a higher appreciation for PV powered products...|$|R

5|$|As {{noted by}} several critics and commentators, the film's story <b>and</b> <b>style</b> mirror {{elements}} from Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera. V and the Phantom both wear masks {{to hide their}} disfigurements, control others through the leverage of their imaginations, have tragic pasts, and are motivated by revenge. V and Evey's relationship also parallels many of the romantic elements of The Phantom of the Opera, where the masked Phantom takes Christine Daaé to his subterranean lair to re-educate her.|$|E
5|$|Beat 'em ups {{are related}} to—but {{distinct}} from—fighting games, {{which are based}} around one-on-one matches rather than scrolling levels and multiple enemies. Such terminology is loosely applied, however, as some commentators prefer to conflate the two terms. At times, both one-on-one fighting games and scrolling beat 'em ups have influenced each other in terms of graphics <b>and</b> <b>style</b> and can appeal to fans of either genre. Occasionally, a game will feature both kinds of gameplay.|$|E

The initial ideas and proposals from the show's writers were more often suited for film than television and had to be scaled down.
