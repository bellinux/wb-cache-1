5|$|Electric vehicle {{warning sounds}} are {{a series of}} sounds {{designed}} to alert pedestrians to the presence of electric drive vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and <b>all-electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> (EVs) travelling at low speeds. Warning sound devices were deemed necessary by some government regulators because vehicles operating in all-electric mode produce less noise than traditional combustion engine vehicles and can {{make it more difficult for}} pedestrians, the blind, cyclists, and others, to be aware of their presence. Warning sounds may be driver triggered (as in a horn but less urgent) or automatic at low speeds; in type, they vary from clearly artificial (beeps, chimes) to those that mimic engine sounds and those of tires moving over gravel.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, a {{total of}} 2,736 Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEVs were sold, making the plug-in hybrid the top selling new car {{in the country that}} month, {{representing}} a market share of 6.8% of all the new cars sold.

The Netherlands is the second country, after Norway, where plug-in electric cars have topped the monthly ranking of new car sales. The strong increase of plug-in car sles during the last months of 2013 was due {{to the end of the}} total exemption of the registration fee for corporate cars, which is valid for 5 years.

500|$|... plug-in {{electric}} vehicles {{are more expensive}} than conventional vehicles and hybrid {{electric vehicles}} due to the additional cost of their lithium-ion battery packs. Other factors discouraging the adoption of electric cars are the lack {{of public and private}} recharging infrastructure and, in the case of <b>all-electric</b> <b>vehicles,</b> drivers' fear of the batteries running out of energy before reaching their destination due to the limited range of existing electric cars. Plug-in hybrids eliminate the problem of range anxiety associated to <b>all-electric</b> <b>vehicles,</b> because the combustion engine works as a backup when the batteries are depleted, giving PHEVs driving range comparable to other vehicles with gasoline tanks. Several national and local governments have established tax credits, subsidies, and other incentives to promote the introduction and adoption in the mass market of plug-in electric vehicles depending on their battery size and all-electric range.|$|E
