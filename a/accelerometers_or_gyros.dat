40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative method for accurate mobile robot dead-reckoning, called Internal Position Error Correction (IPEC). In previous work, the IPEC method was successfully implemented on {{a specially designed}} mobile robot with two differential drive axles, called the Multi-Degree-of-Freedom (MDOF) mobile robot. Experimental results with the MDOF robot showed consistently one to two orders of magnitude better dead-reckoning accuracy than systems based on conventional dead-reckoning. Yet, the IPEC system requires neither external references (such as navigation beacons, artificial landmarks, known floorplans, or satellite signals), nor inertial navigation aids (such as <b>accelerometers</b> <b>or</b> <b>gyros)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The {{subject of}} this paper is a study of the {{influence}} of the inertial sensors errors on the position, speed and attitude of a bidimensional strap-down inertial navigation system in a horizontal plane. The MATLAB/SIMULINK models used for the acceleration and rotation sensors are based on the sensors data sheets and on the IEEE equivalent models for the inertial sensors. The models can be used in the numerical simulation of the strap-down inertial navigation system, close by real conditions {{from the point of view}} of the distortions suffered by the useful acceleration and rotation signals at the passing through any type of <b>accelerometers</b> <b>or</b> <b>gyros</b> desired to be implemented in the navigator. These models have the advantage to work independent from each of the sensors ’ errors and thus to study their influence on the inertial navigator...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} Internal Position Error Correction (IPEC) — a {{new method}} for accurate and reliable dead-reckoning with mobile robots. The IPEC method has been implemented on our recently developed Multi-Degree-of-Freedom (MDOF) mobile platform, a vehicle {{in which two}} differential-drive mobile robots (called &quot;trucks&quot;) are physically connected through a compliant linkage. In addition to its four wheel encoders, the MDOF platform has one linear and two rotary internal encoders, which allow measurement of the relative distance and bearing between the two trucks. During operation, both trucks perform conventional dead-reckoning with their wheel encoders. But, in addition, the IPEC method uses information from the internal encoders to detect and correct dead-reckoning errors {{as soon as they}} occur. Our system, called Compliant Linkage Autonomous Platform with Position Error Recovery (CLAPPER), requires neither external references (such as navigation beacons, artificial landmarks, known floorplans, or satellite signals), nor inertial navigation aids (such as <b>accelerometers</b> <b>or</b> <b>gyros).</b> Nonetheless, the experimental results included in this paper sho...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{is described}} for controlling nutation motion in a spinning body, comprised of an angular accelerometer with its input axis {{perpendicular to the}} spin axis of the body, a flywheel with an axis of rotation perpendicular to the axis of the accelerometer and to the spin axis of the body, and a motor for driving the flywheel to attenuate or build nutation. The motor is controlled by circuitry that monitors {{the output of the}} angular accelerometer and drives the motor clockwise or counterclockwise during predetermined nutation angles synchronized to the zero crossover points of the accelerometer signal centered about the nutation peaks. The motor drive is phased to damp nutation motion to zero for stabilization. To increase the noise immunity of the system, when the output of the accelerometer falls below a threshold level, the circuitry operates in an open loop, beat mode where data representing the last accelerometer signal that exceeded that threshold level is stored, and the motor drive is controlled by the stored data. In a second version, the motor is controlled to supply a predetermined amount of nutation motion to a body undergoing testing on a spin table for energy dissipation evaluation. In each version, the use of an angular accelerometer rather than a linear <b>accelerometer</b> <b>or</b> <b>gyro</b> to monitor nutation enables placement of the nutation control apparatus at any location relative to the spin axis of the body requiring only crude orientation and no calibration...|$|R
40|$|A {{control law}} is {{developed}} for the SAS-D nutation control system. Nutation is removed in a sub-optimal manner with respect to fuel consumed, but attitude errors are minimized. The research performed consist of an investigation of nutation theory and nutation due to energy dissipation, nutation detection analysis, nutation control analysis, and error analysis. The resulting nutation control system uses an <b>accelerometer</b> <b>or</b> rate <b>gyro</b> to sense the nutation angle theta which varies sinusoidally at the nutation frequency omega. The sensed nutation angle is compared with a threshold theta sub tau. If the sensed nutation is greater, a thrust pulse of duration equal to the period of one spin cycle is initiated. Since the threshold theta sub tau is set equal {{to the amount of}} nutation that can be removed by one thrust pulse of duration equal to one spin cycle, the spacecraft nutation is reduced to near zero. Error analysis indicates that the nutation sensed, the threshold, the amount of nutation that can be removed during one thrust pulse, and the time duration of one thrust pulse are all sensitive to the spacecraft spin frequency imparted by the Delta rocket. Thus, the nutation control system was designed to be adaptive to the possible variations in imparted spin frequency...|$|R
40|$|Kalman filters {{designed}} for many aerospace systems {{turn out to}} be unsatisfactory. The estimate errors become large compared to the errors predicted by the theory ('divergence'). One of the principal causes of this failure is that the system model contains states or modes that are undisturbed by the modeled process noise, and are neutrally stable (NS). One cure for such problems is periodic restarting of a time-varying Kalman filter. Other cures include minimum variance observers with eigenvalue constraints, added noise, pole-shifting, and destabilization. Several examples are given, including effective time-invariant estimators for the longitudinal and lateral motions of an airplane where several NS modes are undisturbed by wind gusts. An interpretation of these estimators as a 'strapdown IMU' without <b>accelerometers,</b> gimbaled <b>gyros,</b> <b>or</b> servos is given...|$|R
50|$|The {{platform}} {{on which}} the seeker is mounted must be stabilized {{with respect to the}} motion of the missile body and the seeker must be moved to stay aligned with the target. The stabilization system must cope with rapid acceleration, up/down and lateral movements. This is done by a gimbal system, <b>accelerometers,</b> spinning-mass <b>gyros</b> (<b>or</b> MEMS), and motors to drive changes in position of the platform. The system is basically an autopilot. Information from the gyros is fed to the guidance electronics which drive a torque motor attached to the seeker platform to keep the seeker aligned with the target. The wires that connect the seeker {{with the rest of the}} missile are carefully designed to avoid inducing motion or drag on the seeker platform.|$|R
