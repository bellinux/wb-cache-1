40|$|Quantitative {{electron}} probe microanalysis (EPMA) measurements {{on the cross}} section of a polymer or <b>anticorrosive</b> <b>paint</b> coating on steel, exposed to a corrosive environment (3. 5 % NaCl solution), showed diffusion of iron ions through the coating toward the environment.

These values compare with corrosion rates and the activation energies determined from gravimetric measurements (weight loss) obtained under the same conditions.

40|$|Pure {{magnesium}} was {{processed by}} a powder metallurgy (PM) route to generate microstructural features that provide higher mechanical properties {{than those of}} cast pure magnesium and commercial AZ 31 alloy. Nevertheless, corrosion resistance of PM Mg needs to be improved if this material {{is to be used}} for structural applications in a corrosive medium. In the present work, the corrosion protection effectiveness of three simple, economical and environmentally friendly coatings has been evaluated over immersion time in a chloride-containing solution. A silane coating, an <b>anticorrosive</b> <b>paint</b> formulated with ion-exchangeable pigments (IEPs) and a chemical conversion treatment to form a MgF 2 layer have been studied. Silane film and <b>anticorrosive</b> <b>paint</b> enhance the corrosion behaviour of PM Mg during the first hours of immersion, but their protection effectiveness completely disappears after 2 days. For longer immersion times, the fluoride conversion coating may be considered the only viable and effective barrier to protect PM magnesium from degradation. © 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Hexavalent {{chromium}} compounds (chromates) {{have been}} widely used as inhibitive pigments in the formulation of anticorrosive paints. However, their high toxicity and carcinogenic effects are forcing the development of effective chromate-free organic coatings. One such alternative, which is very attractive from a scientific point of view, is the use of ion-exchangeable pigments (IEPs). The few studies conducted with this type of pigment are not conclusive about their anticorrosive efficiency and controversy surrounds their functioning mechanisms, interchange capacity and anticorrosive performance. In the present research, which focuses on the anticorrosive protection of this type of pigment, calcium/silica (Ca/Si) IEPs were synthesized in first step, next epoxide paint coatings were formulated. IEPs have been applied on low carbon steel panels. The effect of these non-toxic pigments on the protective properties of coatings has been tested by means of natural and accelerated corrosion tests (humidity, salt spray and SO 2).

40|$|Water-borne <b>anticorrosive</b> <b>paints</b> are {{acquiring}} increasing {{relevance for}} the anticorrosive protection of steel surfaces {{exposed to the}} atmosphere, mostly due to the restrictions imposed by environmental and health protection agencies, However, some companies continue to be reluctant to use paints of this type to protect steel against atmospheric corrosion.

This paper presents results of experimental studies and includes technical considerations on the <b>anticorrosive</b> performance of <b>paint</b> systems using water-borne or solvent-borne paints when exposed to atmospheres with different degrees of corrsivity. On the basis of the practical results and the considerations presented in this paper, it may be stated that water-borne paint systems are currently available which present excellent anticorrosive behaviour, even in highly corrosive atmospheres.

40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} a special {{interest}} to study and develop new smart anticorrosive pigments in order to increase the protection life time of organic coatings and, simultaneously, to find alternatives to conventional toxic and carcinogenic hexavalent chromium compounds. In this respect, the great development of nanotechnologies in recent years has opened up a range of possibilities in the field of <b>anticorrosive</b> <b>paints</b> through the integration of encapsulated nanoscale containers loaded with active components into coatings. By means of a suitable design of the capsule, the release of the encapsulated corrosion inhibitor can be triggered by different external or internal factors (pH change, mechanical damage, etc.) thus preventing spontaneous leakage of the active component and achieving more efficient and economical use of the inhibitor, which is only released upon demand in the affected area. In the present work, the improved anticorrosive behaviour achieved by encapsulated mesoporous silica nanocontainers filled with an environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitor has been evaluated. It has been proven that a change in the pH allows the rupture of the capsules, the release of the inhibitor, and the successful protection of the carbon steel substrate...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{multilayer}} epoxy/polyurethane type <b>anticorrosive</b> <b>paint</b> {{systems are}} widely {{employed in the}} protection of steel structures due to their high efficiency against atmospheric corrosion. However, the use of isocyanate in the curing process, and the high volatile organic compound (VOC) content of such systems, makes it necessary to search for new isocyanate-free paints. Hybrid organic-inorganic coatings, such as epoxy-siloxane coatings, represent a step forward {{in the field of}} paint coatings for atmospheric corrosion protection. These new isocyanate-free hybrids present low VOC levels - due to the high solid content associated with their low viscosity - along with good heat and UV radiation stability and excellent chemical resistance. With the new polysiloxane inorganic resins it is hoped to improve the anticorrosive behaviour of traditional organic binders. This work assesses the anticorrosive performance of one-layer epoxy-siloxane coatings compared to traditional two-layer epoxy/polyurethane coatings, in paint systems with and without an epoxy or silicate-type zinc-rich primer. The anticorrosive properties of these coatings applied on steel substrates have been evaluated using a wide range of experimental techniques, namely measurement of water vapour and oxygen permeability in free films, 3 -year outdoor testing, accelerated corrosion testing (condensing humidity, Kesternich, salt fog and Prohesion), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Hybrid epoxy-siloxane films show the lowest oxygen and water vapour permeability, capacitance values, and the highest ionic resistance values, along with excellent behaviour in humidity and Kesternich tests, outperforming traditional epoxy/polyurethane paints, while the behaviour of both types of coatings is similar in the salt fog, Prohesion and short-term outdoor tests. This type of paint requires the presence of zinc-rich primers to optimise its anticorrosive behaviour. © 2010 Elsevier B. V. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Offshore {{areas are}} rough and high energy areas. Therefore, {{offshore}} constructions {{are prone to}} high technical risks. This chapter elaborates on the technical risks of corrosion and biofouling and technical risks through mechanical force. The expected lifetime of an offshore structure is {{to a great extent}} determined by the risk of failures through such risks. Corrosion and biofouling threaten the robustness of offshore structures. Detailed and standardized rules for protection against corrosion of offshore structures are currently lacking. There is a need for an accepted uniform specification. A major technical risk of a combined wind-mussel farm is that of a drifting aquaculture construction that strikes a wind turbine foundation. We investigate two scenarios related to this risk: (1) Can a striking aquaculture construction cause a significant damage to the foundation? (2) If a drifting aquaculture construction gets stuck around a turbine foundation and thus increases its surface area, can the foundation handle the extra (drag) forces involved? A preliminary qualitative assessment of these scenarios leads to the conclusion that a drifting mussel or seaweed farm does not pose a serious technical threat to the foundation of a wind farm. Damage to the (<b>anticorrosive)</b> <b>paint</b> of the turbine foundation is possible, but this will not lead to short term structural damage. Long term corrosion and damage risks can be prevented by taking appropriate maintenance and repair actions. Contrarily to mussel or seaweed farms, the impact/threat of a drifting fish farm on structural damage to a wind foundation depends on type, size and the way of construction of the fish cages. The risk of extra drag force due to a stuck aquaculture construction relates particularly to jacket constructions because any stuck construction may lead to (strong) increase of the frontal surface area of the immersed jacket structure and thereby give increased drag forces from currents or waves. To ensure an optimal lifetime and lower operational costs maintenance aspects of materials for both offshore wind and aquaculture constructions should be taken into account already in the design phase of combined infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyze {{household}} {{risk factors}} associated with high lead levels in surface dental enamel. METHODS: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted with}} 160 Brazilian adolescents aged 14 - 18 years living in poor neighborhoods in the city of Bauru, southeastern Brazil, from August to December 2008. Body lead concentrations were assessed in surface dental enamel acid-etch microbiopsies. Dental enamel lead levels were measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and phosphorus levels were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. the parents answered a questionnaire about their children's potential early (0 - 5 years old) exposure to well-known lead sources. Logistic regression was used to identify associations between dental enamel lead levels and each environmental risk factor studied. Social and familial covariables were included in the models. RESULTS: the results suggest that the adolescents studied were exposed to lead sources during their first years of life. Risk {{factors associated with}} high dental enamel lead levels were living in or close to a contaminated area (OR = 4. 49; 95 % CI: 1. 69; 11. 97); and member of the household worked in the manufacturing of paints, paint pigments, ceramics or batteries (OR = 3. 43; 95 % CI: 1. 31; 9. 00). Home-based use of lead-glazed ceramics, low-quality pirated toys, <b>anticorrosive</b> <b>paint</b> on gates and/or sale of used car batteries (OR = 1. 31; 95 % CI: 0. 56; 3. 03) and smoking (OR = 1. 66; 95 % CI: 0. 52; 5. 28) were not found to be associated with high dental enamel lead levels. CONCLUSIONS: Surface dental enamel {{can be used as a}} marker of past environmental exposure to lead and lead concentrations detected are associated to well-known sources of lead contamination.

40|$|In {{the field}} of <b>anticorrosive</b> primer <b>paints</b> there is growing {{interest}} to find environmentally friendly anticorrosive pigments to replace Cr(VI) pigments which are highly toxic both {{to the environment and}} to human health, with known carcinogenic effects. This has become a major challenge of the last decades for all the sectors involved in metallic protection. One of the alternatives of great scientific interest is the use of ion exchange pigments, which are mostly naturally abundant, easily synthesised, relatively cheap, and above all environmentally friendly. Studies of these pigments have not been conclusive about their anticorrosive efficiency and controversy surrounds their functional mechanisms, exchange capacity and anticorrosive performance. This paper focuses on the anticorrosive protection afforded by one anion-exchange pigment: hydrotalcite/vanadate (HT/V). Alkyd primer coatings formulated with non-toxic HT/V pigment have been applied on carbon steel specimens, and the effect of the pigment on the protective properties of the coatings has been evaluated by means of natural and accelerated corrosion tests (humidity, salt spray and Kesternich, 0. 2 L SO 2). A traditional zinc chromate (ZC) pigment has also been used for comparative purposes. The exchange and inhibitor capacity of the HT/V has also been evaluated. The inhibiting power of the HT/V pigment in solution is seen to be less than that of the traditional ZC pigment, showing also a low exchange capacity and solubility. On the other hand, the behaviour of the HT/V pigmented primers applied on carbon steel is suitable in moderate environments and deficient in aggressive environments, in both natural atmospheres and accelerated tests, and is much poorer than that of the zinc chromate.

5000|$|Hexavalent {{chromium}} (chromium(VI), Cr(VI), chromium 6) {{refers to}} chemical compounds that contain the element chromium in the +6 oxidation state (thus hexavalent). Virtually all chromium ore is processed via hexavalent chromium, specifically the salt sodium dichromate. Approximately 136000 tonne lb of hexavalent chromium were produced in 1985. Additional hexavalent chromium compounds are chromium trioxide and various salts of chromate and dichromate, among others. Hexavalent chromium {{is used in}} textile dyes, wood preservation, anti-corrosion products, chromate conversion coatings, {{and a variety of}} niche uses. Industrial uses of hexavalent chromium compounds include chromate pigments in dyes, paints, inks, and plastics; chromates added as <b>anticorrosive</b> agents to <b>paints,</b> primers, and other surface coatings; and chromic acid electroplated onto metal parts to provide a decorative or protective coating. Hexavalent chromium can be formed when performing [...] "hot work" [...] such as welding on stainless steel or melting chromium metal. In these situations the chromium is not originally hexavalent, but the high temperatures involved in the process result in oxidation that converts the chromium to a hexavalent state.

Neste sentido este trabalho descreve o desenvolvimento e estudo de tintas ecologicamente corretas formuladas usando fosfato de zinco (ZP), molibdato de zinco (ZM), molibdato de zinco e cÃlcio (ZCM), fosfomolibdato de zinco (ZMP) e fosfomolibdato de zinco e cÃlcio (ZCMP), como alternativas seguras aos pigmentos anticorrosivos tradicionais (chumbo, cromo e outros metais pesados). Adicionalmente, consideraÃÃes ambientais tÃm limitado o uso de tintas organossolÃveis devido estas contribuÃrem para a poluiÃÃo atmosfÃrica e problemas de saÃde. Assim, resinas epÃxis hidrossolÃveis foram usadas na formulaÃÃo das tintas epÃxis anticorrosivas. O {{principal}} objetivo deste trabalho Ã empregar pigmentos de molibdatos para avaliar sua eficiÃncia contra corrosÃo em tintas hidrossolÃveis. As propriedades inibidoras dos pigmentos foram avaliadas por curvas de polarizaÃÃo potenciodinÃmica, monitoramento do potencial de circuito aberto e perda de massa por imersÃo de substratos ferrosos (SAE 1010) em soluÃÃo saturada dos pigmentos em 10 - 2 mol dm- 3 NaCl. A caracterizaÃÃo fÃsico-quÃmica dos produtos de corrosÃo foi avaliada por microscopia eletrÃnica de varredura, energia dispersiva de raios-X e difraÃÃo de raios-X. Todos os testes mostraram que os pigmentos fosfomolibdatos apresentaram as melhores propriedades inibidoras de corrosÃo. Todas as tintas foram formuladas com 16 % (v/v) de resina epÃxi, 7, 5 % (v/v) de pigmentos anticorrosivos, e demais componentes e aditivos para manter a relaÃÃo de PVC/CPVC em 0, 8. A espessura da pelÃcula seca de tinta nos painÃis ficou em aproximadamente 120 &# 956;m. O desempenho das tintas foi monitorado por impedÃncia eletroquÃmica durante os testes de imersÃo, de exposiÃÃo atmosfÃrica e de cÃmara acelerado de nÃvoa salina. A estabilidade tÃrmica foi estudada por anÃlise tÃrmica e calorimetria exploratÃria diferencial. Os diagramas de impedÃncia de todas as tintas mostraram somente um arco capacitivo, com os valores de impedÃncia maiores que 109 &# 937;cm 2. os valores de capacitÃncia variaram entre 10 - 6 e 10 - 10 Fcm- 2. Os resultados sugerem que a combinaÃÃo do molibdato e fosfato fornecem as melhores propriedades inibidoras Ãs tintas. Em relaÃÃo Ãs anÃlises tÃrmicas foi possÃvel concluir que os pigmentos de molibdatos e fosfomolibdatos apresentaram o melhor desempenho tanto em relaÃÃo Ã estabilidade tÃrmica da resina epÃxi, uma vez que estes pigmentos mostraram maior interaÃÃo entre pigmento-resina, assim como em relaÃÃo Ã energia envolvida no processo de cura do filme polimÃrico, pois estes pigmentos demonstraram que contribuem para a diminuiÃÃo do calor envolvido no processo de cura.

Additionally, environmental considerations are limiting the use of solvent-borne paints because it contibutes to atmospheric pollution and empairs health problems. Thus, hydrosoluble epoxy resin {{was used in the}} formulation of the water-borne paints. The aim od this research is to employ molybdate-based pigments in order to check their efficiency in water borne paints. Inhibitive properties of the pigments were evaluated by potentiodynamic polarization curves, open ciricuit potential (Eoc) and mass loss monitoring during 30 days in immersion test of SAE 1010 steel in aqueous saturated pigment solutions with 10 - 2 mol dm- 3 NaCl. The physical chemical characterization of the corrosion products was carried out by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray diffraction techniques. All the tests showed that the phosphomolybdate pigments presented the better corrosion inhibiting properties. All the paints were formulated with 16 % (v/v) epoxy resin, 7. 5 % (v/v) anticorrosive pigment, and additives and fillers {{in order to maintain the}} PVC/CPVC ration equal to 0. 8. the dry thickness of the painted samples was approximately 120 &# 956;m. The paint performance was monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) during immersion tests, of the atmospheric exposition and accelerated ensay of salt spray. The thermal stability of the paintings was also studied by thermal gravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. The impedance diagrams of all painted samples showed only one capacitive loop, with impedance values higher than 109 &# 937;cm 2. Capacitance values varied between 10 - 6 and 10 - 10 Fcm- 2. The results suggest that the combination of the molybdate and phosphate gives the best inhibitive properties. About the thermal analyses were observed that the molybdates and phosphomolybdates pigments showed the better performances thus in the thermal stability of epoxy resin, because theses pigments showed higher interaction between pigment-resin; just as in the relation the energy involved in the cure process of polymeric film, because these pigments contribued to reduce the heat involved in the cure process...|$|R
