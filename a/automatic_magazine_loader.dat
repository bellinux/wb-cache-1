40|$|Development of {{the ability}} to {{automatically}} assemble surface mount devices on circuits is described, including the characterization of the assembly process and improvements made to the system to increase the accuracy and repeatability of this process. The accuracy and repeatability of the system were characterized by measurements of the individual system components as well as the actual placement of components on a specially designed gauge. The forces and stresses experienced by the components when handled by the system were analyzed. The ability to deliver surface mount components to the system was developed by the design and development of stick magazines, vibratory feeders, a feeder control system, and an <b>automatic</b> stick <b>magazine</b> <b>loader...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Stripper clips were {{originally}} employed in infantry bolt-action rifles, {{such as the}} Russian Mosin-Nagant, the British Lee-Enfield, and the German Gewehr 98 and its variant the Mauser K98k, the related US Springfield M1903 and many others. [...] Stripper clips were also employed in newer, semi-automatic rifles with internal box magazines, such as the Soviet SKS and Egyptian Hakim Rifle. Many early semi-automatic pistols also used stripper clips to reload, including the Mannlicher M1894, the Roth-Steyr M1907, the Mauser C96. Currently {{they are used to}} top-off detachable box magazines for semi-automatic and <b>automatic</b> rifles. A <b>magazine</b> <b>loader</b> is placed on the lip of the box magazine, the clip is placed inside the loader, and then the rounds are pushed into the magazine.|$|R

50|$|An {{interesting}} production {{feature of}} the Austen was that some parts were manufactured by the diecasting process. These parts were the magazine housing, part of the mechanism for the stock and the forward half of the <b>magazine.</b> The <b>magazine</b> <b>loader</b> was also diecast. The two firms manufacturing the Austen were specialist diecasting companies.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the solid slugs produced in Plant 6, hollow fuel element production was started about January 1, 1956. Hollow slug blanks were produced oversize on a 2⅝" [...] RB-6 Acme-Gridley machine and were centerless ground before the drilling operation. The oversize slug blank was then loaded into a <b>magazine</b> <b>loader</b> on a 1⅝" [...] Acme and thence through a four-step drilling operation making a hole halfway through the blank. The blank was then reversed and again placed in the <b>magazine</b> <b>loader.</b> After a four-step drilling sequence produces a hole {{all the way through}} the blank, a reamer was passed through this hole in the final position. The oversize Outer Diameter was turned concentric with the finished Inner Diameter on an automatic Sundstrand lathe. Subsequent operations were the same as those for the solid slug.|$|R

Here he worked first as a clapper boy, then {{during the course of the}} decade worked his way up to become <b>magazine</b> <b>loader</b> and then an assistant cameraman. At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, he joined the Royal Fusiliers, but was quickly seconded to the army's film unit, making documentary and propaganda films.|$|R
50|$|However, arms {{designer}} Kijiro Nambu {{did nothing}} to address the dimensional tolerance issue between the bolt and gun barrel, which led to frequent failures when fired cases became stuck in the chamber. In order to ensure reliable feeding (theoretically), Nambu resorted to oiling the cartridges via an oil pump in the <b>magazine</b> <b>loader.</b> In practice, this tended to worsen the problem instead, as the oiled cartridges tended to become coated with dust and sand. This feature and its inherent faults was dropped {{with the introduction of}} the Type 99 light machine gun.|$|R

5000|$|Loading a STANAG magazine, {{particularly}} {{one with}} a large capacity and a corresponding high spring pressure pushing the rounds {{to the top of}} the magazine, can be quite difficult. A number of devices are available to make this task simpler. These are sometimes called speedloaders but are more commonly known as <b>magazine</b> <b>loaders,</b> stripper clips, spoons, or stripper clip guides. There are a wide range of both commercial and military type loading tools available for STANAG magazines. For example; draft STANAG 4181 is a type of stripper clip and guide tool proposed for standardization based on the USGI M16 rifle stripper clips and guide tools.|$|R

50|$|Permamounts were {{considered}} premium mounts, with a label {{on one side}} and a neat viewing window on the other. They {{were considered}} suitable for projection because the rigid plastic construction was stiff enough for <b>automatic</b> <b>magazines</b> but no plastic covered the image area so there was no interference with polarization. The operator of the projector did need to be careful not to leave the same slide in the projector for too long, because the heat would eventually start to warp the mount.|$|R
25|$|During development, it {{was found}} that the rifle was not only solidly {{designed}} and well engineered, but it was also capable of firing 18 to 19 aimed shots a minute when used as a single loader – faster than the standard Remington M1867's 13 aimed shots per minute. When used as a <b>magazine</b> <b>loader,</b> {{it was found}} that 11 shots – ten in the magazine and one in the chamber – could be fired in 25 seconds. Tests carried out during the evaluation also indicated that the rifle was more accurate than the Remington M1867, although both weapons were firing the same ammunition from identical barrels. The rifle was also found to be extremely rugged – one of the tests carried out consisted of throwing the rifle repeatedly from a height of 4 meters (12ft) towards a rocky surface in order to see if any of the rounds in the magazine would go off. Even modern firearms would be damaged by this treatment, but the Krag–Petersson survived it with only superficial damage to the woodwork.|$|R
5000|$|Loading {{a firearm}} magazine, {{particularly}} {{one with a}} large capacity and a corresponding high spring pressure pushing the rounds {{to the top of}} the magazine, can be quite difficult. A number of devices are available to make this task simpler, which are sometimes called speedloaders but are more commonly known as <b>magazine</b> <b>loaders,</b> stripper clips, spoons, or stripper clip guides. The simplest are inexpensive devices that depress the top round in the magazine, allowing the next round to be partially inserted with no pressure on it. These are also called [...] "thumb savers", and address ease of loading more than speed of loading. There are also devices available for certain popular firearms, such as the Ruger 10/22, that accept loose ammunition and will load a round into the magazine with a simple push of a button or turn of a crank. These are more complex and expensive (US$25 to US$50), but are more truly a speedloader since they do greatly reduce the time required to load a magazine.|$|R

50|$|Modular <b>automatic</b> feeding <b>magazines</b> {{allow the}} firing of up to four {{different}} and immediately selectable types of ammunition; the magazines (four drums, each with one shell ready to fire and 13 other ammunitions on store) can be reloaded while the mount is in operation.|$|R
5000|$|The 10.5/50 system {{consists}} of an armored turret which is unmanned above ground, and an <b>automatic</b> <b>magazine.</b> The gun is a fully automatic, water-cooled sliding wedge design which is automatically laid in both traverse and elevation. It uses fixed ammunition which is fed from a magazine several meters below the gun turret. Spent cartridges are ejected from a hatch on the turret's rear face. 10.5/50 is known for a switch located in the magazine which is marked [...] "war-peace" [...] (krig-fred). This selected between half and full rate of fire and was normally locked in the [...] "peace" [...] position using a padlock. The lower rate of fire was normally used in peacetime because it meant less wear on the various mechanical systems.|$|R

5000|$|A semi-automatic, self-loading, or [...] "auto loader" [...] firearm is {{one that}} {{performs}} all steps necessary to prepare it for firing again after a single discharge, until cartridges are no longer available in the weapon's feed device or <b>magazine.</b> Auto <b>loaders</b> fire one shot with each pull of the trigger. Some people confuse the term with [...] "fully automatic" [...] firearms. (See next.) While some semi-automatic rifles may resemble military-style firearms, they are not properly classified [...] "Assault Weapons" [...] which refers to those that continue to fire until the finger no longer depressed the trigger.|$|R
5000|$|The vehicle carries 21 155mm {{projectiles}} in {{the fully}} <b>automatic</b> <b>magazine.</b> Reloading the magazine from the accompanying munitions carrier takes about 10 minutes using the purpose-built lifting device. The howitzer can use NATO modular charges or Bofors Uniflex 2 modular charges. The Uniflex 2IM modular charge system {{consists of two}} sizes of combustible charge cases; one full-size and one half-size case, both filled with {{the same type of}} insensitive [...] (GuDN) propellant. The modular charge system allows several increments of charge to be available and increases the gun system's multiple rounds simultaneous impact (MRSI) capability and good range overlap between the increments. With BAE Bofors/Nexter Bonus rounds the range is 35 km. The range of the gun is extended to 60 km with the precision-guided Raytheon/Bofors XM982 Excalibur round. The Excalibur shell is corrected in flight towards a pre-programmed trajectory by a GPS guidance system.For armoured vehicles, the Bofors 155 Bonus is used.|$|R

50|$|The 8"/55 Mark 71 gun was {{a single}} gun {{adaptation}} of the 8"/55 Mark 16 gun found in triple turrets on Des Moines class cruisers. The prototype gun mount weighed 86 tons and was approximately 20 percent heavier than the 5"/54 caliber Mark 42 gun it replaced. The prototype could fire ten to twelve rounds per minute from a 75-round <b>automatic</b> ready service <b>magazine</b> for semi-fixed ammunition when operated by one man. A specially modified Mark 155 ballistic computer provided 8"/55 ballistics for Hulls Mark 68 gun fire control system.|$|R
