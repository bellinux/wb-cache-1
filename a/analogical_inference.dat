40|$|The {{ways that}} analogy alters the {{representation}} of target information was investigated in 4 experiments. Participants read information about a target, followed by a potential source analog.

40|$|The {{ability to}} reason by analogy is {{particularly}} important because it permits the extension of knowledge of a target domain {{by virtue of its}} similarity to a base domain via a process of <b>analogical</b> <b>inference.</b> The general procedure for <b>analogical</b> <b>inference</b> involves copying structure from the base to the target in which missing information is generated, and substitutions are made for items for which analogical correspondences have already been found. A pure copying with substitution and generation process is too profligate to be useful, and so constraints must be placed on what information is to be carried over. In this paper, the importance of systematicity as a constraint on inference is explored in four studies in which subjects find correspondences between domains and also make inferences. This work suggests that people prefer to make inferences of information connected to systematic correspondences between domains. A second important theme of this paper is that violations of one-to-one mapping can lead to inconsistent object substitutions in inference. The data reveal no such inconsistent substitutions in people's inferences, suggesting that they do respect one-to-one mapping in <b>analogical</b> <b>inference.</b> These findings are discussed relative to four prominent computational models of analogical mapping and inference...|$|E
40|$|Computational {{models of}} analogy {{have assumed that}} the {{strength}} of an inductive inference about the target is based directly on similarity of the analogs and in particular on shared higher order relations. In contrast, work in philosophy of science suggests that <b>analogical</b> <b>inference</b> is also guided by causal models of the source and target. In 3 experiments, the authors explored the possibility that people may use causal models to assess the strength of analogical inferences. Experiments 1 – 2 showed that reducing analogical overlap by eliminating a shared causal relation (a preventive cause present in the source) from the target increased inductive strength even though it decreased similarity of the analogs. These findings were extended in Experiment 3 to cross-domain analogical inferences based on correspondences between higher order causal relations. <b>Analogical</b> <b>inference</b> appears to be mediated by building and then running a causal model.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel {{implementation of the}} bind() operator that is simple, can be efficiently implemented, and highlights the relationship between retrieval queries and analogical mapping. A frame of role/filler bindings can easily be represented using bind() and bundle().

A novel family of representational operators (called braid()) is introduced to address these problems. Other binding systems make the strong assumption that the roles and fillers are disjoint {{in order to avoid}} ambiguities inherent in their representational idioms. The braid() operator can be used to avoid this assumption. The new representational idiom suggests how the cognitive processes of bottom-up and top-down object recognition might be implemented. These processes depend on analogical mapping to integrate disjoint representations and drive perceptual search. <b>Analogical</b> <b>Inference</b> by Systematic Substitution <b>Analogical</b> <b>inference</b> depends on systematic substitution of the components of compositional structures (Gentner, 1983; Halford et al., 1994; Holyoak & Thagard, 1989...|$|E

The success of any analogy depends upon the se-lection of a relevant source.

In Manuscript 1, analogies used in a political campaign were analyzed with the framework developed in the analogical reasoning literature. Results show a number of novel features of analogy use. The majority of source analogs used were not superficially similar to the target problem, most of the mappings between source and target were implicit, and emotion {{appeared to be an}} important feature in the selection of source analogs. In Manuscript 2, three experiments were conducted that explored some of the effects uncovered in the first study. In these experiments, participants were asked either to generate their own source analogs in relation to a target problem or to retrieve a source from a predetermined set. Results show that when generating their own sources, people are not constrained by superficial similarity. However, when asked to retrieve from a predetermined set of sources, participants retrieve based on surface similarity. These results suggest that previous studies may have underestimated people's ability to use structural features in analogical retrieval. The research reported in Manuscript 3 explores the impact of <b>analogical</b> <b>inferences</b> on the representations of target problems. Descriptions of target problems were presented followed by potential source analogs. Results show that people engage in analogical mapping and draw inferences.
