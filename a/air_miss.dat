60|$|Relieved by this {{expression}} of opinion, albeit it was vented upon empty <b>air,</b> <b>Miss</b> La Creevy trotted on to Madame Mantalini's; and being {{informed that the}} governing power was not yet out of bed, requested {{an interview with the}} second in command; whereupon Miss Knag appeared.|$|E

60|$|The cat halted in mid <b>air,</b> <b>missed</b> the ape by but a hair's breadth, {{and with}} horrid snarlings rolled over upon its back, {{clutching}} and clawing {{in an effort}} to reach and dislodge the antagonist biting at its neck and knifing it in the side.|$|R
60|$|Turning up {{the deep}} astrachan {{collar of his}} long coat, the {{stranger}} swept out of the shop, with the <b>air,</b> <b>Miss</b> Fritten afterwards described it, of a Satrap proroguing a Sanhedrim. Whether such a pleasant function ever fell to a Satrap’s lot she was not quite certain, but the simile faithfully conveyed her meaning to a large circle of acquaintances.|$|E
60|$|The {{preliminaries}} were awful, both combatants prancing round {{each other}} with their faces just peering above their bent right arms, while their trusty lefts dealt vicious blows at the <b>air.</b> <b>Miss</b> Nugent turned pale and caught her breath at each blow, then she suddenly reddened with wrath as James Philip Hardy, having paid his tribute to science, began to hammer John Augustus Nugent about the face in a most painful and workmanlike fashion.|$|E
6000|$|On {{this day}} the juniors were quite certain that secret {{proceedings}} {{of a highly}} interesting nature were in the <b>air.</b> <b>Miss</b> Tyrell having been out since the morning, Mrs. Wheeler was looking forward anxiously to her return with the view of holding a little private conversation with her, and the entire Wheeler family were no less anxious to act as audience for the occasion. Mr. Bob Wheeler had departed to his work that morning in a condition which his family, who were fond of homely similes, had likened to a bear with a sore head. The sisterly attentions of Emma Wheeler were met with a boorish request to keep her paws off; and a young Wheeler, rash and inexperienced {{in the way of}} this weary world, who publicly asked what Bob had [...] "got the hump about," [...] was sternly ordered to finish his breakfast in the washhouse. Consequently there was a full meeting after tea, and when Poppy entered, it was confidently expected that proceedings would at once open with a speech from the sofa.|$|E

60|$|Once fairly {{forced into}} the premises, James thought fit to forget his long walk and excess of business, {{especially}} as about that moment Aunt Sally and Miss Grace returned from an afternoon call. You may {{be sure that the}} last thing these respectable ladies looked for was to find Uncle Lot and Master James tête-à-tête, over a pitcher of cider; and when, as they entered, our hero looked up with something of a mischievous <b>air,</b> <b>Miss</b> Grace, in particular, was so puzzled that it took her at least {{a quarter of an hour}} to untie her bonnet strings. But James staid, and acted the agreeable to perfection. First, he must needs go down into the garden to look at Uncle Lot's wonderful cabbages, and then he promenaded all around the corn patch, stopping every few moments and looking up with an appearance of great gratification, as if he had never seen such corn in his life; and then he examined Uncle Lot's favorite apple tree with an expression of wonderful interest.|$|E
60|$|The lady I {{had left}} might be about twenty-nine; {{the one who}} went with me {{appeared}} some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look, and <b>air.</b> <b>Miss</b> Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards found she really was, an under-teacher. Led by her, I passed from compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary silence pervading {{that portion of the}} house we had traversed, we came upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room, with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of every age, from nine or ten to twenty. Seen by the dim light of the dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores. It was the hour of study; they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.|$|E

The remaining five finalists in the top 10 that failed to advance {{in the top five}} are the runners up of the pageant. It happened once again in 2017.Note: By 2011, it reverted to its original order with Miss Air as the runner-up or 2nd place, followed by Miss Water, Miss Fire, and Miss Eco-Tourism as 3rd, 4th and 5th placings, respectivelyNote: Imelda Schweighart opted to voluntarily give up her crown in light of controversies that she was involved in including accusing Katherine Espin (Miss Earth 2016) of undergoing surgery, among others thus Loren Mar Artajos who was originally crowned Miss Philippines-Water (2nd runner-up) assumed the title of Miss Philippines-Earth. Miss Philippines-Air (1st runner-up), Kiara Giel Gregorio could not assume the title due to studies in London, therefore she also relinquishes her title as well. Therefore, every runner-up moved 2 steps higher and Maria Fatima Al-sowyed and Charinna Barro, both semi-finalists of that edition, are now part of the elemental court.|$|E
5000|$|On June 29, NBCUniversal, {{which owns}} the 50% stake in the Miss Universe Organization not owned by Donald Trump, {{confirmed}} it was terminating its business ties with Trump - saying {{in a statement that}} [...] "respect and dignity for all people are cornerstones of our values" [...] - and would no longer air the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants (Miss Teen USA has not aired on conventional television since the 2007 pageant, as it was not included in NBC's renewed television contract with the Miss Universe Organization for uncited reasons; Trump was also dismissed as host of The Celebrity Apprentice, which NBC will continue to air as United Artists Media Group holds the licensing rights to the reality competition series). Mexican media conglomerate Televisa also announced it would cut ties to Trump and end its television contract with the Miss Universe Organization. In a June 29 interview with the Kansas City Star, Miss Kansas USA 2015 Alexis Railsback - who is of Mexican-American descent - said that it was [...] "really unfortunate and kind of unfair that the Miss USA pageant is kind of taking the brunt for Donald Trump's speech". Noting that the Miss Universe Organization is a standalone entity, she iterated that Trump [...] "does not organize the pageant, and does not run what goes on" [...] and that she believes the fallout stemming from the remarks is not [...] "really related to the pageant in any way, {{other than the fact that}} he is the co-owner". Following the decision, some pageant contestants and supporters backed a Change.org petition and used the hashtag #SavetheSash on social media and on a video posted to the pageant's official Facebook page, urging NBC to reconsider their decision not to <b>air</b> <b>Miss</b> USA.|$|E
