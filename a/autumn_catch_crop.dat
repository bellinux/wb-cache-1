The static two-factorial experiment included ploughing tillage (A) and conservation tillage with <b>autumn</b> disking of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (B) or with their spring disking (C).

We compared a leek sole crop (S) with two intercropped systems of leek and early-sown dyer’s woad (five weeks after leek planting) (IE) or late-sown dyer’s woad (eight weeks after leek planting) (IL) in two seasons: 2012 and 2013. To reveal root and resource competition, leek with dyer’s woad rows left empty (Semp), and early and late-sown dyer’s woad with leek rows left empty (DEemp, DLemp) were included. Yield, dry above-ground biomass, aboveground N accumulation and soil inorganic N (Ninorg) were measured as well as root growth by use of minirhizotrons to 2. 3 m soil depth. Results showed that the marketable yield of leek in IE and IL systems was comparable with the yield in the S system when calculated per length of leek row. The Relative Competition Index (RCI) revealed that interspecific competition facilitated the growth of leek but hampered that of dyer’s woad. The rooted zone increased from 0. 5 m in the S system to more than 2 m depth in those of the intercropped systems. Dyer’s woad ceased growing above ground but kept growing below ground after crop harvest and extended roots under the leek root system in 2012. Intercropping increased the root intensity of late-sown dyer’s woad after leek harvest in the 0. 75 – 1. 75 m soil layer compared to dyer’s woad growing alone (DLemp), while the root depth was not affected. The intercropped system with early-sown dyer’s woad reduced soil Ninorg by 52 kg ha− 1 relative to the sole-cropped system, and dyer’s woad accumulated 48 kg N ha− 1 in aboveground biomass at harvest in 2013. Late-sown dyer’s woad had fewer roots, left higher soil Ninorg and had lower aboveground N accumulation than early-sown dyer’s woad until the following spring. Therefore, early-sown dyer’s woad is applicable in an organic intercropped system with high yields of leek to decrease the risk of nitrate leaching...|$|R

The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was comparison of the effect of plough tillage and conservation tillage with the use of various <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> on the yield and grain quality of spring wheat sown in monoculture on rendzina soil.

40|$|Overwintering legume-based <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (LBCCs) {{may play}} an {{important}} role in ecological intensification of agricultural production, especially in low-input systems like organic farming. The emerging concept of ecological intensification (or sustainable intensification) calls for new approaches to produce sufficient food with little environmental impact. Aimed at environment-friendly food production, organic farming may be a good candidate approach to meet the challenges of ecological intensification. Nitrogen (N) is a major constraint of crop yield in organic cropping systems due to restrictions of inorganic fertiliser input. LBCCs are capable to take up N from both the soil and the atmosphere (i. e., via biological N fixation (BNF)), and thus may act as an important source of N in crop rotations, enhancing crop yields but maybe also emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O, a potent greenhouse gas), in particular after soil incorporation of residues, which needs further evaluation. The main focus of this thesis was to investigate the effects of contrasting <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (i. e., legume-based vs. non-legume-based) on N 2 O emissions and N availability to succeeding organic spring barley. Therefore, a one-year field plot study was performed to monitor the N 2 O fluxes and to investigate the N supply as influenced by three LBCCs compared with two non-LBCCs and a bare fallow control on a loamy sand soil in Denmark. <b>Catch</b> <b>crops</b> may be harvested before winter for other purposes, e. g., used as winter fodder or in anaerobic digestion, which may emphasise the importance of root residues in N supply. Hence, the consequences on N supply and N 2 O emissions of <b>autumn</b> harvest of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were also compared with incorporation of whole-plants by spring tillage in this study. Along with the field study, an in-situ 15 N labelling experiment in microplots was conducted to quantify the biological N fixation (BNF) in LBCCs and the recovery of the labelled residue N in spring barley with separate manipulation of top and root residues. Moreover, the period after residue incorporation is a “hot moment” for N 2 O emissions from the soil. In a laboratory incubation study, N 2 O evolution from simulated incorporation of <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> residues was studied under controlled environment with addition of 15 N-enriched nitrate. By this way, the contributions of denitrification and nitrification to N 2 O fluxes were estimated, which is necessary to better understand the underlying processes of N 2 O emission and to develop specific mitigation strategies. Compared to non-LBCCs, LBCCs accumulated significantly more N, of which more than half was derived from BNF as shown by 15 N dilution. The higher amounts of N accumulation in LBCCs increased the yield of the following spring barley markedly, which was negatively affected by <b>autumn</b> harvest of <b>catch</b> <b>crops.</b> The macro-roots at 0 – 18 cm of the five <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> tested accounted for 31 – 50...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Legume-based <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (LBCCs) may {{act as an}} {{important}} source of nitrogen (N) in organic crop rotations because of biological N fixation. However, the potential risk of high nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions needs {{to be taken into account}} when including LBCCs in crop rotations. Here, we report the results from a one-year field experiment, which investigated N availability and N 2 O emissions as affected by three LBCCs, i. e., red clover (CL), red clover–ryegrass mixture (GC) and winter vetch (WV), two non-LBCCs, i. e., perennial ryegrass (GR) and fodder radish (FR), and a control (CO) without <b>catch</b> <b>crops.</b> The effect of two <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> management strategies was also tested: autumn harvest of the <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> versus incorporation of whole-crop residues by spring ploughing. LBCCs accumulated 59 – 67 kg N ha− 1 in their tops, significantly more than those of the non-LBCC, 32 – 40 kg N ha− 1. Macro-roots accounted for > 33 % of total N in the <b>catch</b> <b>crops.</b> In accordance with this, LBCCs enhanced the performance of the succeeding unfertilised spring barley, thus obtaining a grain yield of 3. 3 – 4. 5 Mg ha− 1 compared to 2. 6 – 3. 3 Mg ha− 1 grain yield from non-LBCC and the fallow control treatments. <b>Autumn</b> harvest of <b>catch</b> <b>crops,</b> especially LBCCs, tended to reduce crop yield. The annual N 2 O emissions were comparable across treatments except for fodder radish, which had the highest N 2 O emission, and also the highest average yield-scaled N 2 O emission, at 499 g N 2 O-N Mg− 1 grain. Although the sampling strategy employed in this study introduces uncertainty about the spatial and temporal variability, differences in seasonal emission patterns among <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were captured and harvest of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> in late <b>autumn</b> induced significantly higher emissions during winter, but lower emissions after residue incorporation in spring. In comparison with non-LBCC, LBCCs have the potential to partly replace the effect of manure application in organic cropping systems with greater crop production and less environmental footprint with respect to N 2 O emissions. However, harvest of the <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> may reduce crop yield unless the harvested N is recycled as fertiliser to the crops in the rotation...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to explore the possibility to use clover <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> instead of ryegrass in organic crop production on coarse sand. Two field experiments were performed, which included different animal manure regimes and different soil K- and N-levels. The residual effect of the clover <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> on the yields of a succeeding spring barley test crop was significantly higher than for the ryegrass. When animal manure (70 kg total-N ha- 1) was added to the succeeding spring barley in the ryegrass system the difference between the clover and ryegrass <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> disappeared. Thus clover appeared to have the potential for substituting animal manure. Leaching of nitrate-N and K were estimated by means of porous ceramic suction cups installed at 0. 8 m depth. The annual N leaching from a spring barley reference treatment without <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were approximately 100 kg ha- 1. Clover and ryegrass <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> reduced the losses significantly by 40 to about 80 % depending on the year, and {{there were no significant differences}} between the two <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> types.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{perennial}} ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and their short- and long-term effects on nitrogen leaching and nitrogen turnover in soils. Results are presented from three field experiments on a sandy soil in south-west Sweden, where undersown <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> {{were used in}} cropping systems with and without applications of liquid manure. The effects of different tillage practices on soil mineral nitrogen and leaching were also studied. Two coupled simulation models, which describe water flow and nitrogen transformations and transport in soil, were used for calculations of nitrogen mineralization and soil nitrogen balances. A more detailed study of the residual effects of ryegrass on the nitrogen supyly to the subsequent crops and nitrogen leaching was performed in lysimeters, using 'N-labelled ryegrass. Undersown <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> efficiently reduced nitrogen losses when mineral fertilizer or manure was applied at normal rates (90 - 1 10 kg Nha). Over five years, undersown <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> reduced nitrogen leaching by 60 %, on average, compared with soil which was conventionally tilled in August-September. Incorporation of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> affected nitrogen mineralization mainly during the first growing season following incorporation, when approximately 20 - 30 % of <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> nitrogen was released. The results {{emphasize the importance of}} an early onset of nitrogen mineralization in spring after incorporation of <b>catch</b> <b>crops.</b> This is necessary in order to overcome the soil-depletion effect of nitrogen uptake induced by the <b>catch</b> <b>crop.</b> Simulations showed that incorporation of <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> material in late autumn instead of spring can result in a time distribution of nitrogen mineralization more suitable for a subsequent cereal crop, but this was not verified by the results of the lysimeter experiment. It seems important to obtain further knowledge of how to improve the degree of synchronization between nitrogen mineralization after incorporation of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and nitrogen demand of the subsequent crops.

Our results show differing capabilities of various <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> species in producing above-ground biomass and preventing nitrogen leaching. White mustard reached the highest aboveground dry matter yield, 1416 kg/ha, which was higher than that of Italian ryegrass, phacelia and radish. The dry mass of phacelia (933 kg/ha) was also clearly higher than that of Italian ryegrass and radish, which yielded only 291 kg/ha and 277 kg/ha, respectively.

The aim {{of this research is}} to evaluate the yields of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> of Sinapis alba, Phacelia tanacetifolia, Fagopyrum esculentum, Carthamus tinctorius and Secale cereale v. multicaule, and thus determine the possible applicability of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> in areas with high average annual temperature and low precipitation totals. The small-plot field experiment was performed on clay-loam gleyic fluvisol at the Field Experimental Station in Žabčice, Southern Moravia, Czech Republic, within the period of 2006 - 2014. The <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were set up after winter wheat in mid-August. The results have shown a statistically significant difference among different <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> in yield of dry matter and even among years. The yield of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> is mainly dependent on a sufficient supply of water in the soil and the appropriate amount and distribution of rainfall over the growing season. Sinapis alba and Phacelia tanacetifolia regularly reached the highest yields. High yields were also achieved with Fagopyrum esculentum. Due to the method of crop rotation in the Czech Republic, with a predominance of Brassica napus var. napus, it is inappropriate to include Sinapis alba. It is the best to grow Phacelia tanacetifolia and even Fagopyrum esculentum, or a mixture thereof, depending on the use of <b>catch</b> <b>crops...</b>|$|R

It is not always possible to use farmyard manure due to economic, production or technical reasons. <b>Catch</b> <b>crops</b> used as green manures can be an alternative source of organic matter. The experiment {{was carried out in}} central-east Poland (52 ° 06 ’N, 22 ° 55 ’E), in years 2008 – 2011. The successive effect of winter <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (hairy vetch, white clover, winter rye, Italian ryegrass, winter turnip rape) and the type of weed control on the growth and yielding of sweet corn was examined. The <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were sown in early September, incorporated in early May. The effect of the winter <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> on yield was compared to the effect of FYM at a rate of 30 t·ha - 1 and the control without organic manuring. The sweet corn was grown directly after organic fertilization. Three methods of weed control was used: Hw – hand weeding, twice during the growing period, GCM – herbicide Guardian CompleteMix 664 SE, immediately after sowing the seed corn, Z+T – a mixture of herbicides Zeagran 340 SE + Titus 25 WG, in the 3 – 4 leaf stage sweet corn. The highest yields of biomass were found for winter rye (35. 5 t·ha - 1 FM and 7. 3 t·ha - 1 DM), the most of macroelements accumulated winter turnip rape (480. 2 kg N+P+K+Ca+Mg·ha- 1). Generally, leguminous <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> had similar to the FYM and better than non-leguminous <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> yield-forming effect. The highest yield of marketable ears of sweet corn was obtained after FYM (14. 4 t·ha - 1) and after hairy vetch <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> (14. 0 t·ha - 1). A similar yield-forming effect also had white clover and Italian ryegrass. The most of ears from 1 ha was achieved after white clover <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> (59. 3 tausend), similar after FYM and hairy vetch <b>catch</b> <b>crop.</b> The highest kernel yields were found after FYM (10. 7 t·ha - 1).

The experiment was carried out in east-central Poland (52 ° 03 ’N, 22 ° 33 ’E). The following summer <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were grown: phacelia, am-aranth, sunflower, serradella and faba bean. The <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> seeds were sown in 2004 - 2006 at three dates: on the 21 stJuly, 4 th and 18 th August. The effect of summer <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> was compared to FYM applied at the rate of 40 t·ha- 1. The <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> biomass (roots + above ground parts) and FYM were incorporated in the third decade of October. Sweet corn seeds (6 kg·ha- 1) were sown in mid-May, in the years 2005 - 2007, at the between – and in-ter-row spacing of 65 × 20 cm. Sweet corn ears were hand-harvested at the stage of milk maturity of kernels, at the turn of August and Septem-ber. During the harvest marketable yield of ears (t·ha- 1) and number of marketable ears per 1 ha were determined. Economic evaluation of sweet corn cultivation under diversified organic fertilization was conducted ac-cording to the standard gross margin method. The calculation was based on the 2014 prices. The highest yield and number of ears were obtained after <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> with faba bean and phacelia sown on the 21 st July and after FYM. Delaying the sowing date of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> resulted in a decrease in the successive yielding effect.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{nitrogen}} (N) availability related to fertilizer type, <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> management, and rotation composition on cereal yield and grain N were investigated in four organic and one conventional cropping systems in Denmark using the FASSET model. The four-year rotation studied was: spring barley–(faba bean or grass-clover) – potato–winter wheat. Experiments were done at three locations {{representative of the}} different soil types and climatic conditions in Denmark. The three organic systems that included faba bean as the N fixing crop comprised a system with manure (stored pig slurry) and undersowing <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (OF+C+M), a system with manure but without undersowing <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (OF−C + M), and a system without manure and with <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (OF + C−M). A grass-clover green manure was used asNfixing crop in the other organic system with <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (OG+C+M). Cuttings of grass-clover {{were removed from the}} plots and an equivalent amount of total-N in pig slurry was applied to the cropping system. The conventional rotation included mineral fertilizer and <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (CF+C+F), although only non-legume <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were used. Measurements of cereal dry matter (DM) at harvest and of grain N contents were done in all plots. On average the FASSET model was able to predict the yield and grain N of cereals with a reasonable accuracy for the range of cropping systems and soil types studied, having a particularly good performance on winter wheat. Cereal yields were better on the more loamy soil. DM yield and grain N content were mainly influenced by the type and amount of fertilizer-N at all three locations. Although a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> benefit in terms of yield and grain N was observed in most of the cases, a limited N availability affected the cereal production in the four organic systems. Scenario analyses conducted with the FASSET model indicated the possibility of increasing N fertilization without significantly affecting N leaching if there is an adequate <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> management. This would also improve yields of cereal production of organic farming in Denmark...|$|R

This study focused on the yields of spring oats and spring barley in systems with and without manure in two different cropping systems that differed {{in the proportion of}} legume-based <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (O 2 lower and O 4 higher) and in the rotation composition (grass-clover green manure in O 2 and pulse crops in O 4). Three consecutive four-year crop rotations were established at three locations representative of the different soil types (loamy sand, sandy loam and coarse sand) and climatic conditions. Crop management and soil operations were performed following common practices in organic farming. Measurements of dry matter (DM) and nitrogen (N) content of grain cereals at harvest, aboveground biomass in <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and green manure crops in autumn and of the green manure crop at the first cutting were performed. The effect of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> on grain yield varied with cereal and <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> species, soil and rotation type, and the application of N in manure.

In this study mixtures of winter wheat and <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were analyzed as alternative growing system to avoid high leaching losses. In a field experiment pure winter wheat grown as control showed highest N-losses. Leaching losses of 140 kg N ha- 1 after the pre-crop grass-clover and of 50 kg N ha- 1 after oats as pre-crop were measured.
