40|$|SUMMARY: Although dural {{arteriovenous}} fistulas (DAVFs) {{occur in}} any structure that {{is covered by}} the dura mater, DAVFs at the posterior <b>condylar</b> <b>canal</b> have not been reported. We present a DAVF that involves the posterior <b>condylar</b> <b>canal</b> and drains into the posterior condylar vein and the occipital sinus, which was treated by selective transvenous embolization. Knowledge of venous anatomy of the craniocervical junction and careful assessment of {{the location of the}} arteriovenous fistula can contrib-ute to successful treatment. The posterior <b>condylar</b> <b>canal</b> is one of the important ca-nals that communicate between the intracranial and ex-tracranial space. Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) can involve any structure that is covered by dural or meningeal matter. However, {{to the best of our}} knowl-edge, no case of DAVF involving the posterior <b>condylar</b> <b>canal</b> has been reported. We present the case of a patient with a DAVF that involves the posterior <b>condylar</b> <b>canal.</b> We also discuss the venous structures related to the posterior <b>condylar</b> <b>canal...</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>condylar</b> <b>canal</b> (or {{condyloid}} canal) is a canal in the condyloid fossa of {{the lateral}} parts of occipital bone behind the occipital condyle. Resection of the rectus capitus posterior {{major and minor}} muscles reveals the bony recess leading to the <b>condylar</b> <b>canal,</b> which is situated posterior and lateral to the occipital condyle. It is immediately superior to the extradural vertebral artery, which is making a loop above the posterior C1 ring to enter the foramen magnum.

40|$|The {{variations}} in vascular anatomy and cranial foramina {{have important implications}} for their accurately recognition as normal or pathological. The condylar vein exits the skull base through the <b>condylar</b> <b>canal,</b> communicating the jugular foramen and the condylar fossa. The main purpose of this report was to asses the prevalence and normal anatomical patterns of the <b>condylar</b> <b>canal.</b> Eighty-one cadaveric skull base specimens were retrospectively examined for the unilateral or bilateral presence or absence of the canal. In addition, the <b>condylar</b> <b>canal</b> was classified for its relationship with the sigmoid-lateral sinus, in two types: Intrasinus canal type and Retrosinus <b>canal</b> type. The <b>condylar</b> <b>canal</b> was found bilaterally in 25 skulls (30. 8 %); unilaterally in 25 skulls (30. 8 %) and was absent in 31 specimens (38. 2 %). A higher prevalence of Intrasinus canal type was found (54. 3 %). Although it was only identified 2 cases (2. 4 %) of retrosinus canaltype, associated forms (4. 9 %) were discovered during examination. Of the unilateral cases, 14 cases were right sided and 11 cases were left sided (17. 8 % and 13. 5 % among all cases, respectively). The <b>condylar</b> <b>canal</b> has two anatomical patterns: intrasinus canal type and retrosinus canal type.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Passing {{from the}} supine to the upright {{position}} favors cerebral venous outflow into vertebral venous systems rather than into the internal jugular veins. We {{sought to determine}} venous connections between dural venous sinuses of the posterior cranial fossa and craniocervical vertebral venous systems. METHODS: Corrosion casts of the cranial and cervical venous system were obtained from 12 fresh human cadavers, and anatomic confirmation was made by dissection of three previously injected fresh human specimens. MR venography was performed to provide radiologic correlation. RESULTS: The lateral, posterior, and <b>anterior</b> <b>condylar</b> veins and the mastoid and occipital emissary veins were found to represent the venous connections between the dural venous sinuses of the posterior cranial fossa and the vertebral venous systems. This study revealed the nearly constant presence of the <b>anterior</b> <b>condylar</b> confluent (ACC) located on the external orifice of the canal of the hypoglossal nerve. The ACC offered multiple connections with the dural venous sinuses of the posterior cranial fossa, the internal jugular vein, and the vertebral venous system. All these structures were shown by MR venography. CONCLUSION: The lateral, posterior, and <b>anterior</b> <b>condylar</b> veins and the mastoid an...|$|R
40|$|Background: Claims {{that there}} are {{dramatic}} differences in <b>anterior</b> <b>condylar</b> anatomy between the sexes {{have led to the}} design of total knee implants with thinner anterior condyles specifically for use in women. We had observed, in our patients, differences in <b>anterior</b> <b>condylar</b> anatomy that appeared to be highly variable and dependent on the size, height, and ethnicity of the patient as well as his or her sex. Because of this observed variability, we sought to determine if differences in <b>anterior</b> <b>condylar</b> anatomy between the sexes actually exist. Methods: Two hundred and twelve randomly selected magnetic resonance images (112 of men and 100 of women) were evaluated. The anterior condyle was defined as the area of bone anterior to the anterior femoral cortex, 10 mm above the joint line. The medial and lateral heights of the anterior condyles were measured in millimeters directly from magnetic resonance imaging data obtained in two planes. The so-called aspect ratio was calculated to determine whether patient size had an effect {{on the size of the}} anterior condyles. Results: On the basis of the numbers available, there was no significant difference (p = 0. 16) between the sexes with regard to lateral condylar height. The average difference was only 0. 5 mm. There was a significant difference (p = 0. 001) between men and women with regard to medial condylar height. However, the average difference was only 1. 1 mm. While the difference between the sexes with regard to <b>anterior</b> <b>condylar</b> height was nominal, the measurements were highly variable regardless of sex.

40|$|Background: The <b>condylar</b> <b>canal</b> {{opens at}} the base of the skull just behind the {{occipital}} condyles. The patency of the channel depends upon the condylar emissary vein that runs along its path. Objective: To study the anatomical variation in posterior condylar foramen. Materials and Methods: A total of 50 dry adult human skulls were used from the Department of Anatomy, ESIC Medical College, Chennai, to study the posterior <b>condylar</b> <b>canal</b> and its variations. Results: The incidence of posterior condylar foramina was 26 %, bilateral 16 %, and unilateral 10 %. Intrasinus form of posterior condylar foramina was in 20 % and retrosinus form in 6 % of the 50 skulls observed in our study.

40|$|Aim: In the paracondylar region(lateral to the {{occipital}} condyles) {{there might}} be morphological variation {{in the form of}} an anomalous foramina. This anomalous foramina may represent the course of an emissary vein in absence of posterior <b>condylar</b> <b>canal</b> or an aberrant course. Material & Method: 82 dry adult skulls (164 sides), of Indian origin and of both the sexes formed the basis for this study. The region anterior, posterior and lateral to the occipital condyles was carefully examined for the presence of foramina. Complete foramina were only considered for this study. The patency was ascertained by passage of a probe through it. Results: paracondylar foramina was observed in 12. 1 % specimens,in 10. 9 % it was predominantly located on the left side and in 1. 2 % it was bilateral. No right sided paracondylar foramina was observed. Unilateral left sided Double hypoglossal canal was seen in 4. 8 % specimens.

40|$|Microsurgical anatomy for lateral {{approaches}} to the foramen magnum, especially for transcondylar fossa (supracondylar transjugular tubercle) approach, was studied using cadavers. The transcondylar fossa approach is an approach in which extradural removal of the posterior portion of the jugular tubercle through the condylar fossa {{is added to the}} far lateral approach. Some differences between this approach and the transcondylar approach are demonstrated. The atlanto-occipital joint and the jugular tubercle are obstacles for the lateral approaches. The condylar fossa forming the external occipital surface of the jugular tubercle is located supero-posterior to the occipital condyle. The fossa is limited laterally by the sigmoid sulcus and the jugular foramen. The posterior <b>condylar</b> <b>canal</b> communicating anteriorly with the distal end of the sigmoid sulcus, the jugular foramen, or the hypoglossal canal opens {{at the bottom of the}} fossa. The condyle is situated inferior to the posterior <b>condylar</b> and hypoglossal <b>canals,</b> and the jugular tubercle is located superior to them. In the transcondylar fossa approach the posterior part of the jugular tubercle is extradurally removed, but the condyle and the atlanto-occipital joint are untouched. On the other band, in the transcondylar approach the medial parts of the condyle and the lateral mass of Cl are removed. The latter approach offers better visualization of the inferior part of the foramen magnum. The essential difference of the two approaches is in the direction of looking and the extent of resection of the atlanto-occipital joint. Both approaches offer excellent view of the ventral dural space in the lower clivus and the foramen magnum, but the level of exposure differs somewhat between them. In the lateral {{approaches to}} the foramen magnum, the condylar fossa, the posterior <b>condylar</b> <b>canal,</b> and the posterior condylar emissary vein all play an important role as intraoperative anatomical landmarks...|$|R

40|$|The <b>anterior</b> <b>condylar</b> {{confluence}} (ACC) {{is a small}} complex venous structure located medial to {{the jugular}} vein and adjacent to the hypoglossal canal. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report of transvenous Onyx embolization for ACC dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF). Three patients with ACC DAVF were treated using the Onyx liquid embolic agent with or without detachable coils. Complete angiographic obliteration of the fistulas was achieved in all cases without permanent lower cranial neuropathy. This report suggests that the controlled penetration of Onyx is advantageous in order to obliterate ACC DAVFs {{with a small amount of}} embolic material. BACKGROUND An <b>anterior</b> <b>condylar</b> confluence (ACC) dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) is a rare lesion (rate reported as 3. 6 % of all DAVFs) 1 but, up to a decade ago, some cases of this disease were reported under other names (eg, DAVF involving the hypoglossal canal, DAVF of the anterior con-dylar vein) or as the adjacent fistulas (eg, DAVF involving the inferior petrosal sinus, DAVF of the marginal sinus (MS)) due to the complicated venous structure at the craniocervical junction (figure 1). 2 – 5 Recently, based on the contributions of high-resolution diagnostic tools and several arti-cles about the detailed anatomy of this location, the terminology has been almost harmonized and suc-cessful endovascular treatments based on this accur-ate anatomical knowledge are being developed. At present, most ACC DAVFs can be suessfully treated with transvenous coil embolization. 1 – 3 6 – 11 However, it is not always possible to achieve com-plete obliteration using only coils in such a restricted small complex compartment without migrating into adjacent vital venous structures including the internal jugular vein, and compres-sing the hypoglossal nerve. 1 3 9 Especially in high-flow lesions, the use of liquid embolic material such as Onyx (Covidien/ev 3 Neuromuscular...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{endovascular}} coil embolization for dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) of <b>anterior</b> <b>condylar</b> confluence (ACC). A 43 -year-old man with hyperlipidemia was admitted with the left pulsatile tinnitus. Angiograms revealed DAVF at the ACC. The arterial supply was the left ascending pharyngeal artery, and the main drainage was vertebral venous plexus. The transvenous coil embolization was performed. The shunt flow decreased gradually, but not disappeared completely. During the procedure, we changed treatment strategy from venous side to the transarterial embolization. The shunt flow was disappeared except draining into vertebral venous plexus, and the patient'fs symptoms improved. ACC is venous confluence of 3 - 5 mm near the jugular bulb. ACC DAVF is extremely rare. In late years, ACC attracts its attention as craniocervical venous system is understood. ACC DAVF has been assumed to be marginal sinus DAVF or hypoglossal canal DAVF.

40|$|Study Design: Reliability of {{clinical}} measurement. Objectives: To establish a standardized ultrasonographic approach to quantify anterior {{translation of the}} mandibular condyle during mouth opening by examining the reliability of imaging acquisition and processing. Background: Restricted mouth opening is a common limitation in individuals with temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD), however the arthrokinematics of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) during mouth opening have not been studied thoroughly. Furthermore, how anterior translation of the mandibular condyle contributes to mouth opening remains unclear. Methods: Twenty-eight subjects without TMD participated. During day 1 of data collection, all subjects performed maximal mouth opening while an examiner placed a linear transducer overlying the TMJ and the zygomatic arch to record dynamic images. On day 2 of data collection, the same procedure was performed on 6 subjects that participated in day 1 of data collection. To establish inter- and intra- rater reliability of imaging processing, 3 examiners measured condylar translations on 2 days with 7 days apart. To determine intra-rater reliability of imaging acquisition, images obtained from 2 days of data collection were analyzed. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standard errors of measurement (SEMs) were used to evaluate reliability. A linear regression model {{was used to assess}} the association between <b>anterior</b> <b>condylar</b> translations and mouth opening.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although dynamic contrast-enhanced MR {{angiography}} {{studies for}} ar-teriovenous malformations (AVFs) and brain tumors have shown promising results, no formal attempt {{has yet been}} made to similarly evaluate dural AVFs. To assess the practical applicability of 2 D thick-section contrast enhanced MR digital subtraction angiography (MRDSA) for the diagnosis and management of dural AVFs, MRDSA and intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IADSA) were comparatively evaluated. METHODS: We performed 80 consecutive MRDSA studies for 25 dural AVFs, including 11 cavenous sinuses, 9 sigmoid sinuses, 2 tentorial sinuses, one <b>anterior</b> <b>condylar</b> vein, one craniocervical junction, and one spine. MR images were continuously obtained following the initiation of a bolus injection of gadrinium chelates and subtraction images were constructed. We thereafter evaluated the imaging quality and hemodynamic information from all 46 MRDSA images performed in parallel with IADSA in either perioperative or follow-up studies. RESULTS: Most MRDSA images detected early venous filling, sinus occlusion, leptomeningeal venous drainage, and varices.

40|$|Unilateral or {{bilateral}} dislocation of the TMJ is frequent. Usually it can {{be treated}} by the method described by Hippocrates. If conservative treatment (splint therapy, biofeedback, etc.) does not succeed related to recurrent fixed TMJ-dislocation, surgical therapy strategies become necessary. Above all mentally retarded or patients with neuromuscular disorders may necessitate surgical treatment. The two surgical main procedures are: 1. Removal of mechanical obstacles by reduction of the eminentia. 2. Creation of a mechanical obstacle towards the <b>anterior</b> <b>condylar</b> translation. The here presented case shows the treatment of a reccurent, fixed anterior TMJ-dislocation using a miniplate which enables a absolut heightening of the articular tubercle in a 76 years old lady with Morbus Alzheimer and Parkinson.

METHODS: The study included 130 osteoarthritic knees in 65 men and 65 women in China. None had anterior femoral osteophyte or serious patellar femoral joint degeneration. The following were measured using computed tomography and analyzed to identify morphological differences according to sex in the resected distal femurs: <b>anterior</b> lateral <b>condylar</b> height (ALCH), <b>anterior</b> medial <b>condylar</b> height (AMCH), and mediolateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) dimensions.

There were significant differences between men and women in ALCH values (P =  0. 014) but not in AMCH values (P =  0. 09). Women had smaller ML/AP aspect ratios than men for a given AP dimension.

40|$|Background: Patellofemoral {{arthroplasty}} (PFA) {{can yield}} successful results in appropriately selected patients. The varus-valgus position or coronal {{alignment of the}} trochlear implant is determined by how its transitional edges articulate with the condylar cartilage. Whilst variation in condylar anatomy will not influence the axis of the lower limb in PFA, it can impact on the Q-angle of the PF joint. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze how the coronal alignment can be influenced by the choice of anatomical landmarks. Materials and methods: Retrospective analysis of 57 PFAs with measurements of alignment from full leg radiographs. Results: Coronal alignment following <b>anterior</b> <b>condylar</b> anatomy leads to a mean (SD) proximal valgus alignment of 100 ° (9 °). Aligning the component with Whiteside's line gives a better alignment with less variance 89 ° (3 °). Discussion: A trochlear component with a higher Q-angle compensates for patellar maltracking if the condylar anatomy would tend to put the implant in a more proximal varus or neutral position. If the trochlear component is proximally aligned in valgus this may have the opposite effect. Aligning the trochlear component with the AP-axis in the coronal plane avoids maltracking and optimally utilizes the design features of the implant. Level of evidence: Level III...|$|R
40|$|This concludes {{a series}} of {{descriptive}} statistical reports on discrete cranial traits in 81 human populations from around the world. Four variants classified as vessel and nerve related characters were investigated: patent condylar canal; supraorbital foramen; accessory infraorbital foramen; and accessory mental foramen. A significant asymmetric occurrence without any side preference was detected for the accessory mental foramen. Significant intertrait associations {{were found between the}} accessory infraorbital and supraorbital foramina in the panPacific region and Subsaharan African samples. The intertrait associations between the accessory infraorbital foramen and some traits classified as hypostotic were found mainly in the samples from {{the western part of the}} Old World, and those as hyperostotic traits in the samples from eastern Asian and the related population samples. With a few exceptions, the occurrence of a patent <b>condylar</b> <b>canal</b> and a supraorbital foramen was predominant in females, but the accessory infraorbital and accessory mental foramina were predominant in males. The frequency distributions of the traits showed interregional clinality and intraregional discontinuity. A temporal trend was found in the Northeast Asian region in the frequencies of the accessory infraorbital and accessory mental foramina.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{influence}} of rotational alignment of the femoral and patellar components on patellar tilt after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Materials and Methods: A total of 56 patients (76 knees) who underwent TKA using Advance Medial Pivot Knee system between May 2009 and April 2011 and were available for minimum 1 -year follow-up were enrolled in this study. Whiteside’s line and the transepicondylar line were used to determine the rotational alignment of the femoral component. Patella cut was aimed to be parallel to the anterior patellar cortex during surgery. Radiographic evaluation was performed using plain axial radiographs. The rotational alignment of the femoral component was measured as the angle between the <b>anterior</b> <b>condylar</b> axis and the surgical transepicondylar axis. The patellar resection angle was measured between the patellar resection axis and the anterior cortical line of the patella. Patellar tilt was evaluated to investigate the correlation with the rotation of the femoral component and patellar resection angle. Results: The mean rotation of the femoral component was 0. 42 o± 3. 18 o of internal rotation. The mean patellar resection angle was 1. 82 o± 3. 44 o, indicating medial overresection. The mean patellar tilt was 6. 12 o± 4. 31 o of lateral tilt. The rotational angle of the femoral component showed a negative correlation with patellar tilt in the linear regression analysis (p= 0. 749), but the patellar resection angle showed a positive correlation with patellar tilt (p? 0. 001). Conclusions: Accurate patellar resection is recommended for proper patellar tracking in TKA...|$|R
40|$|Occipital condyles, {{located at}} the {{inferior}} sides of lateral parts of occipital bone, are important structures that connect the cranium and the vertebral column. Their size, shape, location and, also, their congruence with superior articular facets of the atlas vertebra are of great importance for the stability of craniovertebral junctions. The progress in medical diagnostic and surgical techniques {{in the area of}} foramen magnum, requires the knowledge regarding anatomical aspects of this region. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the measurements of the occipital condyles, as well as to analyse the variations in the shape of the condyles and their position in relation to the foramen magnum. This study included 25 adult human skulls (11 male and 14 female) from the Osteological collection of the Department of Anatomy at Medical Faculty in Novi Sad. Nine parameters, which define morfological properties of the occipital condyles, were measured using Vernier caliper. Also, the shape and location of the condyles, as well as the narrowness of the foramen magnum were described. Our findings show that length of the left occipital condyle, as well as distance between the posterior top of the left occipital condyle and basion are statistically greater in male crania, comparing to female crania. According to the shape of the occipital condyles, we classified them in seven groups. Predominant type is oval shaped. The condylar foramen is bilaterally present in 36 % and the occipital condyles bilaterally protrude the foramen magnum in 40 % of analyzed crania.

40|$|Background. Occlusal splints are {{nowadays}} {{commonly used}} in dentistry to treat symptoms of myoarthropathies of the masticatory system, but also to treat simple occlusal parafunctions. Still, the exact mechanism by which the treatment works is unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to find out the answers to following questions: 1. is there an immediate change of the minimum condyle-fossa distance and accompanying disc thickness by inserting a Michigan splint and 2. is it possible to displace the main loading area on the disc by inserting a Michigan splint? Methods. For each subject and each temporomandibular joint (TMJ), four magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) recordings were taken in the following situations: maximum intercuspation without/with Michigan splint, maximum protrusion without/with Michigan splint (splint 3 mm). The image stacks were reconstructed to three-dimensional virtual models using the Amira™ software. Several measurements were taken on these models and subsequently compared within and across the subjects. Results. No significant change in the global minimum condyle-fossa distance could be achieved by inserting a Michigan splint. However, in most TMJs (18 out of 20) a shift of the main loading area (the area with the smallest joint space) could be observed. This effect could cause an unloading of the otherwise most loaded zone. The intensities of MR images within the discs did not differ significantly intraindividually, thus indicating that all discs were segmented in the same way and were comparable. Most subjects (8 of 10) reached a more <b>anterior</b> <b>condylar</b> position during protrusion with inserted splint compared to the situation without splint. Conclusion. With this method, no increase of the overall minimum TMJ space due to the sole insertion of a Michigan splint could be demonstrated, however a shift of the main loading area could be shown...|$|R
40|$|Background: The transcondylar {{approach}} (TCA) {{has gained}} importance in recent era which enables shorter and direct route {{to access the}} lesions ventral to the brainstem. The important step in this approach is resection of the occipital condyle (OC). The detailed knowledge of bony anatomy of OC {{and its relation to}} the hypoglossal <b>canal</b> (HC), <b>condylar</b> <b>canal</b> (CC), and jugular foramen (JF) is very important to avoid any iatrogenic injury during craniovertebral surgeries. The aim of the present study is to conduct a morphometric and morphological study and note the variations of the OC and the structures surrounding it in North Indian population. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out on 100 OC. Morphometric measurements of OC and the distances of HC and JF from the posterior end of OC were noted. In addition, the extent of the HC and JF in relation to OC, presence or absence of CC, shape of the OC, and its articular facet were also noted. Results: The incidence of short OC was seen in 13 % skulls. The most common shape of OC was oval or rhomboid. Even though the articular facet was convex in majority of skulls but flat (10 %) and concave (1 %) were also observed. The external and internal distance of HC from the posterior end of OC was 13. 83 mm and 10. 66 mm on the right side and 15. 02 mm and 11. 89 mm on the left side. The OC was related in its middle 1 / 3 to the HC in 15 % skulls and to the whole extent of JF in 3 % skulls. Thirty four percent skulls displayed the septa in the HC. The CC was present bilaterally in 38 % skulls and unilaterally in 40 % skulls. Conclusion: The OC and related structures such as HC, CC, and JF are likely to have variations in respect to morphometry and morphology. This study may prove helpful to neurosurgeons operating in this field, especially during TCA where neurovascular structures emerging from these canals and foramen are more vulnerable to injury...|$|R
40|$|Occlusal {{plane is}} an {{essential}} consideration when multiple long-span posterior restorations are designed. When restorations are added to an existing tooth arrangement characterized by rotated, tipped, or extruded teeth, excursive interferences may be incorporated, resulting in detrimental squeal. The curve of Spee, which exists in the ideal natural dentition, allows harmony to exist between the <b>anterior</b> tooth and <b>condylar</b> guidance. This curve exists in the sagittal plane and is the best viewed from a lateral aspect. It permits total posterior disclusion on mandibular protrusion, given proper anterior tooth guidance. It is unclear that whether the curve of Spee is {{a description of the}} occlusal surface of each arch separately or in maximal intercuspation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the differences in the depth of curve of Spee between the class I, class II, class III and to investigate the relationship of depth of curve of Spee with over jet, over-bite...|$|R
40|$|Mandibular {{shape is}} an {{important}} determinant in facial morphology, consequently, it should bepaid special attention while investigating facial morphology changes. The {{aim of this study}} was todetermine the relationship between condylar radiographic shape and facial growth pattern in patients with CI II skeletal malocclusion. The present retrospective study is of cross-sectional type, performed in Yazd dental faculty, on lateral cephalometric and panoramic radiographs of 40 patients. Cases, under study, had skeletal CI II malocclusion, with an age range of 9 - 12 years for females and 10 - 13 years for males. Condylar properties, including shape, neck width and inclination were investigated. To study the results, X" test and pierson correlation coefficient were used. The findings showed that there is a significant relationship between <b>condylar</b> <b>anterior</b> angle and facial growth pattern. (PO. 0001). This angle is increased in facial vertical growth pattern. Condylar flattening was observed in 57. 5 % cases, which didnot have any significant relationship with facial growth pattern. No significant relationship was found between facial growth pattern and condylar width...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo assess 3 D {{morphological}} variations {{and local}} and systemic biomarker profiles {{in subjects with}} a diagnosis of temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ OA). DesignTwenty-eight patients with long-term TMJ OA (39. 9  ±  16 years), 12 patients at initial diagnosis of OA (47. 4  ±  16. 1 years), and 12 healthy controls (41. 8  ±  12. 2 years) were recruited. All patients were female and had cone beam CT scans taken. TMJ arthrocentesis and venipuncture were performed on 12 OA and 12 age-matched healthy controls. Serum and synovial fluid levels of 50 biomarkers of arthritic inflammation were quantified by protein microarrays. Shape Analysis MANCOVA tested statistical correlations between biomarker levels and variations in condylar morphology. ResultsCompared with healthy controls, the OA average condyle was significantly smaller in all dimensions except its anterior surface, with areas indicative of bone resorption along the articular surface, particularly in the lateral pole. Synovial fluid levels of ANG, GDF 15, TIMP- 1, CXCL 16, MMP- 3 and MMP- 7 were significantly correlated with bone apposition of the <b>condylar</b> <b>anterior</b> surface. Serum levels of ENA- 78, MMP- 3, PAI- 1, VE-Cadherin, VEGF, GM-CSF, TGFβb 1, IFNγg, TNFαa, IL- 1 αa, and IL- 6 were significantly correlated with flattening of the lateral pole. Expression levels of ANG were significantly correlated with the articular morphology in healthy controls. ConclusionsBone resorption at the articular surface, particularly at the lateral pole was statistically significant at initial diagnosis of TMJ OA. Synovial fluid levels of ANG, GDF 15, TIMP- 1, CXCL 16, MMP- 3 and MMP- 7 were correlated with bone apposition. Serum levels of ENA- 78, MMP- 3, PAI- 1, VE-Cadherin, VEGF, GM-CSF, TGFβ 1, IFNγ, TNFα, IL- 1 α, and IL- 6 were correlated with bone resorption...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Panoramic {{radiography}} is {{a diagnostic}} tool, {{which has a}} widespread application {{in the assessment of}} tempromandibular joint (TMJ) by the dentists as well as ear, nose, and throat specialists. Regarding this, the present study aimed to compare the accuracy of this method in the evaluation of the condylar position and osseous changes with that of the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) as the gold standard method. Materials & Methods: This study was conducted on 28 patients with both TMJ panoramic imaging and bilateral CBCT imaging of TMJs. The condylar position was determined in closed-mouth and maximum intercuspation positions based on the measurement of superior, posterior, and anterior joint spaces and osseous changes of condyle, including erosions, osteophytes, resorbtion, Ely’s cyst, flattening, and sclerosis. The images were evaluated by two expert maxillofacial radiologists. Finally, the accuracy of TMJ panoramic radiography was compared with that of CBCT in terms of the sensitivity, specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive values. Results: According to the results, {{there was a significant difference}} between the two techniques regarding the diagnosis of <b>anterior</b> and posterior <b>condylar</b> positions in horizontal dimension (P= 0. 012, P= 0. 007). The sensitivity rates in the anterior and posterior positions were 50 % and 51 %, and the specificity rates were 55 % and 55 %, respectively. Regarding the identification of condylar position in vertical dimension, the two methods showed a significant difference only in the narrowing of superior joint space (P= 0. 004). The sensitivity and specificity in the narrowing of superior joint space in the vertical dimension were 100 % and 79 %, respectively. Regarding the osseous changes, the TMJ panoramic method had a poorer performance in the diagnosis of erosion (sensitivity: 29 %, specificity: 95 %), compared to the CBCT. Nevertheless, no significant difference was observed between the two methods regarding the diagnosis of osteophytes and flattening. Conclusion: TMJ panoramic radiography had a lot of limitations in the detection of the condylar position both in horizontal and vertical dimensions, compared to the CBCT. However, panoramic radiography can be relatively helpful in the initial screening of osseous changes for determining the healthy cases...|$|R
