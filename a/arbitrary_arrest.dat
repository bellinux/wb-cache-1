5|$|In {{the period}} from 1975 to 2001, the Emir ruled by decree. Human rights activists and {{opposition}} leaders made repeated allegations of systematic torture, the <b>arbitrary</b> <b>arrest</b> of thousands, and assassinations, {{all of which were}} denied by the authorities. Bahrain's Shia population widely claimed that they were being discriminated against by the government, and that they were being treated as second class citizens.|$|E
5|$|Boganda's {{attachment}} to his chosen calling weakened {{when he met}} {{and fell in love}} with a young Frenchwoman, Michelle Jourdain, who was employed as a parliamentary secretary. They were married on 13 June 1950, for which Boganda was expelled from the priesthood and cut off from the Catholic hierarchy's support. Boganda and Jourdain would later have two daughters and a son. The affair caused a minor scandal in Paris, but it did little to dent his popularity with his people. In the National Assembly he continued to battle, often in vain, against repressive features of the French administration in Oubangui-Chari. <b>Arbitrary</b> <b>arrest,</b> low wages, compulsory cotton cultivation, and the exclusion of blacks from restaurants and cinemas were all targets of his rhetoric.|$|E
5|$|The Negro Motorist Green Book (at times styled The Negro Motorist Green-Book or titled The Negro Travelers' Green Book) was {{an annual}} guidebook for African-American roadtrippers, {{commonly}} referred to simply as the Green Book. It was originated and published by New York City mailman Victor Hugo Green from 1936 to 1966, during the era of Jim Crow laws, when open and often legally prescribed discrimination against non-whites was widespread. Although pervasive racial discrimination and poverty limited black car ownership, the emerging African-American middle class bought automobiles {{as soon as they}} could, but faced a variety of dangers and inconveniences along the road, from refusal of food and lodging to <b>arbitrary</b> <b>arrest.</b> In response, Green wrote his guide to services and places relatively friendly to African-Americans, eventually expanding its coverage from the New York area to much of North America, as well as founding a travel agency.|$|E

25|$|Eritrea is a one-party {{state in}} which {{national}} legislative elections have been repeatedly postponed. According to Human Rights Watch, the government's human rights record is considered among {{the worst in the}} world.

However, the Eritrean government has continually dismissed the accusations as politically motivated.|$|E
25|$|An Amnesty International (AI) report alleged {{there were}} {{arbitrary}} arrests of bystanders {{on at least}} three occasions during demonstrations against President Lee Myung-bak in Seoul between May and September. Those arrested were detained and released. The Korean National Police Agency (KNPA) stated that police followed {{the requirements of the}} law in responding to the demonstrations.

25|$|The 2009 Human Rights Report by the United States Department of State {{noted that}} human rights in CAR were poor and {{expressed}} concerns over numerous government abuses. The U.S. State Department alleged that major human rights abuses such as extrajudicial executions by security forces, torture, beatings and rape of suspects and prisoners occurred with impunity. It also alleged harsh and life-threatening conditions in prisons and detention centers, <b>arbitrary</b> <b>arrest,</b> prolonged pretrial detention and denial of a fair trial, restrictions on freedom of movement, official corruption, and restrictions on workers' rights.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} sexual abuse among female {{domestic}} workers is another area of concern, particularly given that domestic servants {{are not covered by}} the UAE labour law of 1980 or the draft labour law of 2007. Worker protests have been suppressed and protesters imprisoned without due process. In its 2013 Annual Report, Amnesty International drew attention to the United Arab Emirates' poor record on a number of human rights issues. They highlighted the government's restrictive approach to freedom of speech and assembly, their use of <b>arbitrary</b> <b>arrest</b> and torture, and UAE's use of the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|In {{all areas}} of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the human rights record {{remained}} considerably poor, and numerous serious abuses were committed. Unlawful killings, disappearances, torture, rape, and <b>arbitrary</b> <b>arrest</b> and detention by security forces increased during the year, and the transitional government took few actions to punish violators. Harsh and life-threatening conditions in prison and detention facilities; prolonged pretrial detention; lack of an independent and effective judiciary; and arbitrary interference with privacy, family, and home also remained serious problems. Security forces continued to recruit and retain child soldiers and to compel forced labour by adults and children.|$|E
25|$|The {{involvement}} {{of the military in}} politics has historically led to regular, if infrequent, <b>arbitrary</b> <b>arrest</b> and detention, use of excessive force, torture, and extra-judicial killing by security forces and police. The judiciary has historically suffered from poor jail and prison conditions, prolonged pretrial detention, and executive interference in the judiciary. While all these have improved dramatically since the return to civilian rule, international human rights organizations continue to report sporadic incidents of all these abuses. Post-1999 there has been a marked improvement of civilian control of security forces, with the United States State Department contending every year since 2001 that the military was under civilian control.|$|E

25|$|The law prohibits <b>arbitrary</b> <b>arrest</b> and detention, and the {{government}} generally observes these prohibitions; however, police reportedly arrests and detains citizens arbitrarily on occasion. The federal police have jurisdiction for maintaining {{law and order in}} the federal capital and for federal crimes in the provinces. Other federal police authorities include the Airport Security Police, the Gendarmerie, the Coast Guard, and the Bureau of Prisons. Additionally, each province has its own police force that responds to a provincial security ministry or secretariat. Individual forces vary considerably in their effectiveness and respect for human rights. Corruption is widespread in some forces, and internal controls to counter police abuses are often weak.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1996, several human rights groups brought cases to hold Shell accountable for alleged human rights violations in Nigeria, including summary execution, crimes against humanity, torture, inhumane treatment and <b>arbitrary</b> <b>arrest</b> and detention. In particular, Shell stood accused of collaborating in the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other leaders of the Ogoni tribe of southern Nigeria, who were hanged in 1995 by Nigeria's then military rulers. The lawsuits were brought against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of its Nigerian operation. In 2009, Shell agreed to pay $15.5m in a legal settlement. Shell has not accepted any liability over the allegations against it.|$|E
25|$|Experience of the {{occupation}} varied considerably, depending upon where one lived and one's social position. Many who lived in areas considered important {{to the war effort}} experienced torture, sex slavery, <b>arbitrary</b> <b>arrest</b> and execution, and other war crimes. Many thousands of people were taken away from Indonesia as forced labourers (romusha) for Japanese military projects, including the Burma-Siam and Saketi-Bayah railways, and suffered or {{died as a result of}} ill-treatment and starvation. Between four and 10 million romusha in Java were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia, Only 52,000 were repatriated to Java, meaning that there was a death rate of 80%.|$|E

50|$|Deubet {{served in}} the {{government}} as Minister of the Civil Service and Minister of Communication. Following the resignation of Prime Minister Djimrangar Dadnadji over allegations of ordering <b>arbitrary</b> <b>arrests,</b> Deubet was appointed as Prime Minister on 21 November 2013.|$|R
25|$|Among {{the serious}} human-rights {{problems}} that face Mongolia, especially within {{the police and}} security sector, are the abuse of prisoners by police, uneven law enforcement, poor prison conditions, <b>arbitrary</b> <b>arrest,</b> excessively long periods of pretrial detention, judicial corruption, lack of media independence, government secrecy, domestic violence, and trafficking in persons. Discrimination “on the basis of ethnic origin, language, race, age, sex, social origin, or status” is forbidden, and there is official sexual equality “in political, economic, social, cultural fields, and family.” Increasing {{attention has been paid}} recently to the human-rights impact of the rapid expansion of the mining industry in Mongolia, which in many cases has had a deleterious impact upon the environment of traditional herders and therefore upon their everyday lives and occupational prospects.|$|E
25|$|Shocked by {{the peasant}} revolt, the Diet of 1514 passed laws that {{condemned}} the serfs to eternal bondage and increased their work obligations. Corporal punishment became widespread, and one noble even branded his serfs like livestock. The legal scholar István Werbőczy included {{the new laws}} in his Tripartitum of 1514, which made up the espirit of Hungary's legal corpus until the revolution of 1848. However, the Tripartitum was never used as a code. The Tripartitum gave Hungary's king and nobles, or magnates, equal shares of power: the nobles recognized the king as superior, but in turn the nobles {{had the power to}} elect the king. The Tripartitum also freed the nobles from taxation, obligated them to serve in the military only in a defensive war, and made them immune from <b>arbitrary</b> <b>arrest.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ceres was patron and {{protector}} of plebeian laws, rights and Tribunes. Her Aventine Temple served the plebeians as cult centre, legal archive, treasury and possibly law-court; its foundation was contemporaneous {{with the passage}} of the Lex Sacrata, which established the office and person of plebeian aediles and tribunes as inviolate representatives of the Roman people. Tribunes were legally immune to arrest or threat, and the lives and property of those who violated this law were forfeit to Ceres. The Lex Hortensia of 287 BC extended plebeian laws to the city and all its citizens. The official decrees of the Senate (senatus consulta) were placed in Ceres' Temple, under the guardianship of the goddess and her aediles. Livy puts the reason bluntly: the consuls could no longer seek advantage by arbitrarily tampering with the laws of Rome. The Temple might also have offered asylum for those threatened with <b>arbitrary</b> <b>arrest</b> by patrician magistrates. Ceres' temple, games and cult were at least part-funded by fines imposed on those who offended the laws placed under her protection; the poet Vergil later calls her legifera Ceres (Law-bearing Ceres), a translation of Demeter's Greek epithet, thesmophoros.|$|E
50|$|The Cameroonian Government's {{human rights}} record has been {{improving}} over the years but remains flawed. There continue to be reported abuses, including beatings of detainees, <b>arbitrary</b> <b>arrests,</b> and illegal searches.
