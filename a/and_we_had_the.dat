His off-the-cuff reply was that [...] "I was on the GLC that Mrs. Thatcher abolished, I worked for the NUM <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> NUM strike, I think I would assassinate Thatcher". Conservative MP Conor Burns told the BBC that [...] " [...] very distasteful" [...] and [...] "a very silly remark". McDonnell told the BBC: [...] "I'm sorry if I have caused offence to anyone. It was a joke and in that {{audience}} it was taken as a joke... it {{was taken out of}} context, I can see if people are upset about that and if I have caused offence to anyone of course I apologise".|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "Joh for PM" [...] {{campaign}} was conceived in late 1985, driven largely {{by a group}} of Gold Coast property developers, promoting Bjelke-Petersen as the most effective conservative challenger to Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke, and at the 1986 Queensland election he recorded his biggest electoral win ever, winning 49 of the state's 89 seats with 39.6 percent of the primary vote. The ALP's 41.3 percent share of the vote earned it 30 seats, while the Liberal Party won the remaining 10 seats. In his victory speech, Bjelke-Petersen declared the Nationals had prevailed over the [...] "three forces" [...] who had opposed it: [...] "We had the ALP organisation with its deceits, deception and lies, we had the media encouraging and supporting them, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> Liberal Party... our assault on Canberra begins right now." ...|$|E

2500|$|Days of Our Lives {{had been}} losing viewers in early 2000. The show managed to lure back James E. Reilly, {{who had left}} the show in 1997 to create his own soap opera, Passions. NBC {{said at the time}} that the show [...] "needed a fix, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> fix right here." [...] James E. Reilly began {{crafting}} a big story for the 2003–2004 season. Viewers were shocked to see long-term veteran Abe Carver (James Reynolds) shot at his front doorstep by a strange cloaked figure. Next, viewers saw Jack Deveraux (Matthew Ashford) attacked, and killed with a brick by the same cloaked figure that killed Abe. Next, viewers saw 34-year veteran recovering alcoholic Maggie Horton (Suzanne Rogers) get bludgeoned to death with a wine bottle. The next murder is when Caroline Brady (Peggy McCay) is poisoned. Viewers then saw bad girl Cassie Brady (Alexis Thorpe) fall out of a Halloween pinata with stab wounds. [...] Marlena's ex-husband, Roman Brady (Josh Taylor) is murdered at his wedding to Kate Roberts. At the Horton circus, the serial killer releases a tiger (named Horton), and sets him loose on Tony DiMera. Tony is dying at the hospital, and, much to the fans surprise, the killer is revealed to be Marlena. Marlena's next victim is Doug Williams (Bill Hayes) who has been her friend for years. She kills him at Tom Horton's grave after he finds out she is the killer. The most shocking murder occurs shortly after.Alice Horton (Frances Reid) finds a bloody note at her husband's grave with Marlena's name on it. Subsequently, the evil Marlena murders Alice by choking her with her world-renowned donuts. Marlena confesses, and is arrested by her husband, John Black. She is shot and killed on the prison rooftop. The storyline allowed Days of our Lives to reach #2 in the Nielsen chart for soaps.|$|E
