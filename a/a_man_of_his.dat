5|$|After {{recovering}} from his hip surgery, Costello returned to active competition at age 56. The {{fact that he}} was able to recover from such a major injury is credited to his almost-fanatical style of healthy living. As a devout vegan, Costello credited his meat-free diet with his recovery, as well as the remarkable shape he was in for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> age.|$|E
5|$|Noriega was extradited to France on April 26, 2010. Noriega's lawyers {{claimed the}} La Santé Prison, {{at which he}} was held, was unfit for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> age and rank; the French {{government}} refused to grant him prisoner of war status, which {{he had in the}} United States. On July 7, 2010, Noriega was convicted by the 11th chamber of the Tribunal Correctionnel de Paris and sentenced to seven years in jail. The prosecutor in the case had sought a ten-year prison term. In addition, the court ordered the seizure of €2.3million (approximately U.S. $3.6million) that had long been frozen in Noriega's French bank accounts.|$|E
5|$|Parvateshvar– Head of Meluhan Army and a Suryavanshi, Parvateshvar is a {{follower}} of Shiva. However, he is caught in a dilemma when Shiva decides to destroy Meluha for ending the usage of Somras, and ultimately decides to help the country by leading it in the impending war, being bound to his duty as the protector of the country. He is <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> word and places truth and honour even above God. He is a tall, well-built giant {{of a man and}} is husband to Princess Anandamayi.|$|E

Having never before made an endorsement, McChrystal said he endorsed Moulton, a Marine veteran, because the United States Congress {{could benefit from}} <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> character.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, another {{life-threatening}} illness befell him. Because {{of months}} of incessant diarrhea, {{the signs of}} life were fading from the 94-year-old Mentor of Buddhism. Such pain and fatigue would be unbearable to any robust youth, let alone <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> age. Yet never once did Yin Shun panic or complain. Whenever guests came to visit the venerable master, he summoned up his spirit to speak to them.|$|E
25|$|Raphaël {{embarked}} on a policy of trying to convince Jacques {{of the need to}} win more races as he certainly had the ability to do so... Anquetil had a very strong personality so he was not easily dominated but Géminiani had an even stronger one. He never gave up the task of trying to convince Jacques of the need for more panache, how <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> talent should have an even bigger list of important wins.|$|E

25|$|He was {{progressive}} and anti-progressive at once, and likewise at once both {{a critic of}} the Zeitgeist and its most interesting expression. He was, in effect, stranded on a beachhead of his own thinking between past and future. That he was not able, by himself, to fashion a bridge between them is neither surprising, nor, in the end, disappointing. We should see this failure, rather, as an aspect of his genius. He both was and was not <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time.|$|E
25|$|It {{might have}} been well if Nubar had {{confined}} himself to this modest programme, but it was perhaps hardly to be expected of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ability and restless energy. It must be admitted, however, that the characters of Nubar and Lord Cromer were not formed to run in harness, and it was with {{no surprise that the}} public learnt in June 1888 that he had been relieved of office, though his dismissal was the direct act of the khedive Tawfiq, who did not on this occasion seek the advice of the British agent.|$|E
25|$|He was, we are told, {{a passionate}} collector—not only {{of books and}} manuscripts but works of art of every kind; more {{remarkable}} still for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> class, {{he seems to have}} been an excellent painter. He was the most generous of patrons—to writers and scholars, artists and craftsmen. Finally, he was an excellent Emperor: a competent, conscientious and hard-working administrator and an inspired picker of men, whose appointments to military, naval, ecclesiastical, civil and academic posts were both imaginative and successful. He did much to develop higher education and took a special interest in the administration of justice.|$|E

25|$|Later historians {{stressed}} {{the fact of}} Henry's early death and the succeeding throne quarrel as a stroke of fate and a major setback {{for the development of}} a German nation state begun under his father Frederick Barbarossa. On the other hand, the emperor's stern measures in Sicily earned him the reputation of a cruel and merciless ruler. Present-day historical research classifies Henry as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time; though a capable ruler he had to cope with the centrifugal forces of the disintegrating empire while at the same time he overstretched the Hohenstaufen realm to an extent that finally could not be kept together.|$|E
25|$|The rest of {{the squad}} were disappointing though. Of the other batsmen, only Smith {{averaged}} over 30, and that was flattered by his big century at Antigua. He was in terrible form {{for the vast majority}} of the tour. Ramprakash averaged just over 10 in four Tests – a poor return for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> talents. None of the other bowlers impressed at all – Salisbury picked up seven wickets, but they were expensive, and Igglesden and Malcolm showed little to earn continued selection in the Tests in their brief appearances. Steve Watkin didn't even get that chance in the Test series, despite his fine end to the 1993 Ashes, after an early injury gave the impetus to others.|$|E
25|$|A {{complete}} and versatile player, Gullit epitomised {{the ethos of}} Total Football as he was naturally adept in several positions, and was capable of aiding his team defensively as well as offensively due to his work-rate, ball-winning abilities, and tactical intelligence {{in addition to his}} skill and physical qualities. Normally deployed as an attacking midifielder or as a second striker, he was capable of playing anywhere in midfield or along the front-line, on either wing or even in the centre, and could also play as a sweeper. Regarded {{as one of the greatest}} players of all-time, his foremost attribute was his athleticism, as he used his strength and speed, combined with his technique, to great effect; he was also strong in the air, as he was tall, powerful, and an excellent jumper. Yet, unusually for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> stature, Gullit was an elegant player, who also possessed outstanding natural balance, poise, technical ability, and dribbling skills, which gave a graceful style to his game. Gullit also was noted for his intelligence, creativity, vision, and spatial abilities, qualities that helped him score goals early in his career and enabled him to play in a deeper role as a playmaker late in his days, where he was known for creating chances for teammates. Gullit thus combined physical presence with flair, mental acuity, formidable technique and natural touch, to become an iconic figure in world football. Despite his talent, Gullit struggled with injuries throughout his career, which later affected his fitness.|$|E

500|$|Thored ( [...] ; fl. 979992) was a 10th-century ealdorman of York, {{ruler of}} the {{southern}} half of the old Kingdom of Northumbria {{on behalf of the}} king of England. He was the son of either Gunnar or Oslac, northern ealdormen. [...] If he was the former, he may have attained adulthood by the 960s, when <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> name raided Westmorland. Other potential appearances in the records are likewise uncertain until 979, the point from which Thored's period as ealdorman can be accurately dated.|$|E

500|$|Since Parsifal could {{initially}} only {{be seen at}} the Bayreuth Festival, {{the first}} presentation in 1882 was attended by many notable figures. Reaction was varied. Some thought that Parsifal marked a weakening of Wagner's abilities. The critic Eduard Hanslick gave his opinion that [...] "The Third act may be counted the most unified and the most atmospheric. It is not the richest musically," [...] going on to note [...] "And Wagner's creative powers? For <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> age and his method they are astounding ... It would be foolishness to declare that Wagner's fantasy, and specifically his musical invention, has retained the freshness and facility of yore. One cannot help but discern sterility and prosaicism, together with increasing longwindedness." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his many}} heroics, Sparrow is a pirate and a morally {{ambiguous}} character. When agreeing to trade 100 souls, including Will, to Davy Jones {{in exchange for}} his freedom, Jones asks Sparrow whether he can, [...] "condemn an innocent man—a friend—to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?" [...] After a hesitation Sparrow merrily replies, [...] "Yep! I'm good with it!" [...] He carelessly runs up debts with Anamaria, Davy Jones, and the other pirate lords. Sao Feng, pirate lord of Singapore, is particularly hateful towards him. In a cowardly moment, Sparrow abandons his crew during the Kraken's attack, but underlying loyalty and morality compel him to return and save them. Sparrow claims to be <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> word, and expresses surprise that people doubt his truthfulness; there is no murder on his criminal record.|$|E

[...] In our game with Michigan, we had two men {{instructed}} to play against Schulz and at times three and four were opposed to him. [...] For some time, he handed {{out as much as}} we passed to him in the roughing end of the game. [...] He was here, there and everywhere. He did most of the tackling. [...] He broke up innumerable plays. [...] He was the star of the contest until the continued battering of our men injured him {{to such an extent that}} he had to retire. [...] The rest was easy".
