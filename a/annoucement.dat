40|$|Abstract — We present {{our work}} on {{creating}} {{a team of}} two humanoid robot commentators for soccer games of teams of four AIBO robots. The two humanoids stand on the side lines of the field, autonomously observe the game, wirelessly listen to a “game computer controller, ” and coordinate their <b>annoucements</b> with each other. Given the large degree of uncertainty and dynamics of the robot soccer games, we further introduce a “puppet master” system that allows humans to intervene in a sliding autonomy manner, prompting the robots to commentate on an event if undetected. The robots process then input from these three sources, namely own and shared vision, game controller, and occasional puppet master, to recognize events which they translate into a varied set of predefined <b>annoucements.</b> We present the behavioral architecture, the vision-based event recognition, and the game-based adaptive criteria for the selection of comments. We exemplify our development with multiple illustrative cases corresponding to different game situations. In summary, our work contributes a team of two humanoids fully executing a challenging observation, modeling, coordination, and reporting task...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses option {{prices to}} learn about the {{uncertainty}} surrounding the fundamental information that is revealed on earnings announcement dates. To do this, we introduce a reduced-form model and estimators to separate the uncertainty over the information revealed on earnings dates from normal day-to-day volatility. The fundamental uncertainty estimators are easy to compute and rely only on option price information available prior to the announcement. Empirically, we find strong support for our reduced form specification and investigate the fundamental uncertainty estimators. We find that they are quantitatively large, vary over time, and are informative about the future volatility of stock price movements. Finally, we quantify the impact of earnings <b>annoucements</b> on formal option pricing models...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{analysis}} of high frequency financial time series data has found volatility {{to follow a}} long-memory process and to display an intradaily U-shape pattern. These findings implicitly assume that a stable environment exists in the financial world. To better capture the nonstationary behavior associated with market collapses, political upheavals and news <b>annoucements,</b> we propose a nonstationary class of stochastic volatility models that features time-varying parameters. The generality of our nonstationary stochastic volatility model better accommodates several empirical features of volatility and nests stationary stochastic volatility models within it. To estimate the time-varying longmemory parameter, we use the log linear relationship between the local variance of the maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform's coefficients and their scaling parameter to produce a semiparameteric, OLS estimator.

40|$|This paper uses option {{prices to}} learn about the {{uncertainty}} surrounding firm fundamentals. When firms announce earnings every quarter, they reveal current fun-damentals (earnings, cash flows, sales, taxes, etc.) which were, to varying extents, unknown to investors prior to the announcement. This information revelation is why stock prices often react violently after earnings announcements. This paper devel-ops estimators of the uncertainty associated with information revealed in earnings announcements and investigates. On the theoretical side, we develop no-arbitrage option pricing models in the presence of earnings announcements; and we develop and justify estimators of the earnings uncertainty using option prices. Empirically, we first nonparametrically test for the importance of earnings announcements on op-tion prices and then implement the estimators. We analyze their time series behavior and test for the presence of risk premia. Finally, we quantify the impact that earnings <b>annoucements</b> have on formal option pricing models...|$|R

OpenEdition provides content to 2 million users per month worldwide. The journal platform alone, Revues. org, founded in 1999, is now an umbrella for 143 full open access journals.

OpenEdition Freemium is an opportunity for libraries to get involved in developing a global open access ecosystem for scholars and students. It is designed to give libraries a central position and an active part in the support of open access. The gated content system slows the dissemination of knowledge and puts libraries in the position of mere gatekeepers, worsening the digital divide.

40|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{collection}} consists of extensive research notes for {{a history of the}} Saarland and Lorraine and their Jewish communities from the 14 th century until 1938, with a notable gap for the 19 th century. For the most part, these notes are handwritten annotations by Steinthal in chronological order; he would list important events for each year, sometimes supplemented by excerpts from publications. For the 20 th century, the notes also include related publications such as articles, <b>annoucements</b> and reports as well as correspondence. A lot of materials are related to the Saarland referendum of 1935. It seems like most of the material was gathered in the 1930 s. The collection also holds Steinthal's doctoral dissertation on the status of Jews in the Merovingian and Carolingian empires (5 th through 9 th centuries) as well as a photograph and correspondence with Zvi Avneri of the Leo Baeck Institute Jerusalem. Hugo Steinthal was born in Saarbruecken on July 27, 1893. His parents were Josef Steinthal and Fanny (nee Stolzberg). In 1914, he moved to Freiburg where he studied history and philosophy. Later in 1914 he joined the army, and was discharged in 1916 due to an injury. He continued his studies in Freiburg, Munich and Breslau, where he received his doctorate in 1921. He was rabbi in Saarbruecken until his immigration to France in 1935. After the World War II, he returned to Germany and died in Saarbruecken in 1961.

40|$|The {{link between}} asset prices and {{information}} fundamentals as embodied in news announcement effects is an extremely, {{if not the}} most, important area amongst current research in market microstructure. The lack of adequate transaction data posts an obstacle in this research. In this thesis, based on a valuable intraday transaction-by-transaction dataset for U. S. corporate bonds, we first {{examine the impact of}} public information contained in the macro-economic news and firm-specific information contained in corporate earnings <b>annoucements</b> on the prices of both corporate bonds and stocks. We find that both bonds and stocks react significantly to public news and firm-specific information, and this information is quickly incorporated into both bond and stock prices. More importantly, our results show that stocks do not lead bonds in reflecting firm-specific information, contrary to the conceived intuition that the bond market is less informationally efficient compared with the stock market. Next we examine the frequency of information arrivals of corporate bonds and its impacts on price duration at the intraday level. We find that there are differences in price durations between corporate bonds and stocks, and for a given company, the persistence of the impact on adjusted price duration is normally higher for stocks than bonds. Our results also show that the parameter estimates are more stable and statistically significant for stocks than for bonds in most cases, which indicate that the ACD model characterized the stock return behavior better than the bond data...|$|R

This paper focuses on examining the relationship of the stock market reactions due to dividend announcements and ten company-specific variables identified from the literature as potential determinants. The results from cross-sectional and stepwise regressions both showed that none of the determining variables could explain the variation in cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) for the increasing dividend announcements. For decreasing dividend announcements, both regressions identified the degree of anticipation to be significant and inversely related to CARs. In addition, the indigenous population ownership, which is a unique characteristic of the Malaysian equity market is also found to be significant in influencing the effect of decreasing dividend announcements.

For conjugacy classes, we prove Theorem F from the research <b>annoucement,</b> which exhibits a unique vertex group system called the "nonattracting subgroup system" having the property that the conjugacy classes it carries are characterized as those which are not weakly attracted to the attracting lamination under forward iteration, and also as those which are not weakly attracted to the repelling lamination under backward iteration.
