5|$|On 17 January 2001, the UK {{signed a}} Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the United States Department of Defense (DoD) for full {{participation}} in the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) programme, confirming the JSF as the FJCA. This gave the UK input into <b>aircraft</b> <b>design</b> and the choice between the Lockheed Martin X-35 and Boeing X-32. On 26 October 2001, the DoD announced that Lockheed Martin had won the JSF contract.|$|E
5|$|The first F-22 crash {{occurred}} during takeoff at Nellis AFB on 20 December 2004, {{in which the}} pilot ejected safely before impact. The investigation revealed that a brief interruption in power during an engine shutdown prior to flight caused a flight-control system malfunction; consequently the <b>aircraft</b> <b>design</b> was corrected to avoid the problem. Following a brief grounding, F-22 operations resumed after a review.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{attended}} the Air Corps Engineering School at Wright-Patterson Field, Ohio from July 1932 to June 1933. After graduating, {{he was assigned}} to the <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Design</b> Section of the Aircraft Laboratory there, where he worked {{on the development of the}} P-39, XB-15, B-17 and XB-19. He was promoted to first lieutenant on 1 February 1934, and was Director of the Special Research and Test Laboratory and Director of Accessory Design and Test Laboratory.|$|E

5|$|A 1928 {{graduate}} of the United States Military Academy at West Point, Wilson was commissioned into the United States Army as a second lieutenant in the field artillery but underwent flying training and, on receiving his pilot's wings, transferred to the United States Army Air Corps in 1929. He attended the Air Corps Engineering School at Wright-Patterson Field, Ohio and {{was assigned to the}} <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Design</b> Section of the Aircraft Laboratory there, where he worked {{on the development of the}} XB-15, B-17 and XB-19.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{exploited}} the accident {{to undermine the}} IK-1 concept, with Bajdak joining those criticising the aircraft. The three flights were not considered sufficient to give a verdict on the design, and the debate over its future was fierce. This placed significant pressure on the designers, as every element of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>design</b> was subsequently attacked. Eventually, it was generally agreed that the aircraft was well-designed, but it needed more testing. At this point, Ikarus decided to build a second prototype, as {{it was evident that}} the hand-sewn fabric seam on the wing had not stood up to the strain of aerobatics, and their workmanship was in question. The second prototype took 10 months to build, with the two designers closely involved.|$|E
5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of <b>aircraft</b> <b>design</b> is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E

5|$|The new, larger <b>aircraft</b> <b>design</b> soon emerged, {{which was}} {{initially}} designated as P.1150/3 {{prior to being}} redesignated as the P.1154. In January 1962, HSA submitted the P.1154 design to NATO via the Ministry of Aviation. NBMR.3 also attracted ten other contenders, among which was P.1154's principal competitor, the Dassault Mirage IIIV. This design employed a separate lift/thrust engine concept whereby eight Rolls-Royce engines would provide lift during vertical flight alongside a single turbofan for thrust during horizontal flight. The Mirage IIIV was supported by British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), and also had the favour of {{several members of the}} Air Staff. In May 1962, the P.1154 emerged as the winner in the competition for the NBMR.3 over the Mirage IIIV.|$|E
5|$|World War I was {{the most}} devastating in British {{military}} history, with nearly 800,000 men killed and over twomillion wounded. Early in the war, the BEF was virtually destroyed and was replaced first by volunteers and then a conscript force. Major battles included those at the Somme and Passchendaele. Advances in technology saw {{the advent of the}} tank (and the creation of the Royal Tank Regiment) and advances in <b>aircraft</b> <b>design</b> (including the creation of the Royal Flying Corps) which would be decisive in future battles. Trench warfare dominated Western Front strategy for most of the war, and the use of chemical weapons (disabling and poison gases) added to the devastation.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} from Korea, Bolt was {{assigned}} to the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. as an <b>aircraft</b> <b>design</b> engineer. In this duty, he was detailed to The Pentagon and a board which reported on aircraft performance and tactics. A press conference was held in September 1953 to welcome him to the position, and during this he recounted stories from his service in Korea {{for the first time to}} local newspapers. Bolt's experiences in World War II and the Korean War were used to help shape air combat doctrine. He worked in this assignment for around a year, until 1954 when he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and moved to the Naval Pilot Test Center at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, in St. Mary's County, Maryland. During this time, he took evening classes at the University of Maryland, eventually earning a Bachelor of Science in Military History.|$|E

5|$|The Comet {{is widely}} {{regarded}} both as an adventurous step forward and a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft's legacy does include numerous advances in <b>aircraft</b> <b>design</b> and in accident investigations. The inquiries into the accidents that plagued the Comet 1 were {{perhaps some of the}} most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. In spite of the Comet being subjected to what was then the most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood {{at the time of the}} aircraft's development, nor was the concept of metal fatigue. While these lessons could be implemented on the drawing board for future aircraft, corrections could only be retroactively applied to the Comet.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>aircraft</b> <b>design</b> {{to receive}} the Su-35 {{designation}} had its origins in the early-1980s, {{at a time when}} the Su-27 was being introduced into service with the Soviet Armed Forces. The definitive production version of the Su-27, which had the factory code of T-10S, started mass ("serial") production with the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association (KnAAPO) in 1983. The following year, this Su-27 version reached initial operational readiness with the Soviet Air Defence Forces. Having begun work on an upgraded Su-27 variant in 1982, the Sukhoi Design Bureau was instructed in December 1983 by the Soviet Council of Ministers to use the Su-27 as the basis for the development of the Su-27M (T-10M). Nikolay Nikitin would lead the design effort throughout much of the project's existence, under the oversight of General Director Mikhail Simonov, who had been the chief designer of the Su-27.|$|E
