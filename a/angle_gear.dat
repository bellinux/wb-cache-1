The use of high power density transmission systems such as epicyclic gear trains {{is the way to}} achieve the goal reducing the overall volume and mass compared with traditional configurations. Gears are the main component of the transmissions because they play the crucial role of transmitting the power from the input to the output with a defined ratio. In terms of gear performances, tooth geometry has a direct influence on load carrying capacity: increase the pressure angle modifies the tooth profile with a direct influence on bending and contact stress. To test the benefits of high pressure <b>angles</b> <b>gears</b> in epicyclic transmissions, four different epicyclic systems with same boundary design conditions have been modelled. The reference pressure angle have been varied from 20 ° to 35 ° and other gear parameters such as profile shift coefficient, addendum and dedendum length have been modified consequently to match the design requirements. The results show that increasing the pressure angle has a reductive effect on contact and bending stresses. Using high pressure <b>angle</b> <b>gears</b> in epicyclic transmissions has a beneficial effect on tensile stresses but is unfavourable for the compressive ones. Moreover, it has been seen that pressure angle effect might be enhanced or nullified if other modifications such as profile shift are used concurrently...|$|R

This study investigated the potential to reduce deep-hooking {{and the number of}} under-size A. butcheri caught by varying <b>angling</b> <b>gear</b> and techniques. Three sizes of long shank hook (small [size 8], medium [size 4] and large [size 1 / 0]) and two angling techniques (slack line and tight line) were tested for their deep-hooking rates and selectivity characteristics. Increasing the hook size from small to large decreased the likelihood of deep-hooking by 6. 6 times (95 % CI 2. 3 – 16. 3 times). Fishing with a tight line instead of a slack line decreased the chance of deep-hooking by almost 100 % (95 % CI 0. 8 – 3. 6). Fishing with a large hook instead of a small hook significantly (F = 6. 71, df = 2, P = < 0. 001) increased the mean A. butcheri length, although this mean size increase was less than 1 cm.

By using Matlab interior point method, the gear system parameters are optimized andthe weight {{and the size of}} the sensor are reduced. Bench test results demonstrate that the measurement accuracy of this self-designed sensor is able to meet the demands of EPS. 1. Design of the torque and <b>angle</b> sensor <b>gear</b> set The structural design of sensor gear is shown in fig 1 [1]. We define gear 1 and gear 2 to have the same number of gear teeth; the duplex gears 3, 4, and 5 to have the same number of gear teeth; gear 6, 7 with the same amount of gear teeth. Gear 1, 6, 8 and double gear 3 hence become the main concerns in parameter design. The transmission ratio is respectively: Z 1 =Z 2 = 84 ；Z' 3 =Z’ 4 =Z’ 5 = 15 ；Z 3 =Z 4 =Z 5 = 45 ；Z 6 =Z 7 = 35 ；Z 8 = 36 (1) In Eqs. 1, Z’ 3 refers to the teeth number of the medium-small-sized duplex gear. Z 3 refers to the teeth number of the medium-large-sized duplex gear.

40|$|In {{recreational}} fishing, {{catch and}} release (C&R), where fish are released alive after capture, is commonly adopted to minimize fishing mortality. Injuries from hooking and {{the mode of}} de-hooking can affect survival probability, and the choice of <b>angling</b> <b>gear</b> can affect injury severity. We show for C&R angling for northern pike (Esox lucius) in the Baltic Sea that hooking location and size of fish captured vary among lure types. Hooking in gills and aorta increased bleeding severity, which was generally expressed more strongly in larger pike. Our results supported the notion that anglers can minimize injury in northern pike angling by the choice of appropriate gear. In addition, our study {{is one of the}} first to show that hooking location is also affected by water temperature; low temperatures tended to result in deeper hooking. Despite this, water temperature did not affect level of bleeding in pike, and low water temperatures may be beneficial as they likely reduce the overall stress response in released pike.

40|$|Passive capture {{techniques}} {{involve the}} capture of fishes or other aquatic animals by entanglement, entrapment, or angling devices that are not actively moved by humans or machines while the organisms are being captured (Lagler 1978). The behavior and movements of the animals themselves result in their capture. The techniques used in passive sampling of fish populations {{are similar to those}} used for food gathering over the centuries. Nets and traps have been widely used among various cultures, and many of the currently applied techniques were used by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans (Alverson 1963). Based on their mode of capture, passive sampling devices can be divided into three groups: (1) entanglement, (2) entrapment, and (3) <b>angling</b> <b>gears.</b> Entanglement devices capture fish by holding them ensnared or tangled in webbing or mesh made of natural or artificial materials. Gill nets and trammel nets are examples of entanglement gears (Figure 6. 1). Entrapment devices capture organisms that enter an enclosed area through one or more funnel- or V-shaped openings that hinder escape after entrance. Hoop nets, trap nets, and pot devices are examples of entrapment gears (Figures 6. 2 and 6. 3). Angling devices capture fish with a baited hook and line. Trotlines and longlines are examples of passive <b>angling</b> <b>gears</b> (Figure 6. 4). Gear selectivity and gear efficiency are important considerations with respect to passive sampling devices. Often these terms are used interchangeably, but they have different, specific definitions. Gear selectivity is the bias of a sample obtained with a given gear (Box 6. 1). Selectivity for species, sizes, and sexes of fishes occurs in samples taken with specific types of gear. Species selectivity refers to overrepresentation of particular species in samples as compared with the assemblage of species present. Similarly, size or sex selectivity refers to overrepresentation of specific sizes (lengths) or one sex within samples from a fish population. Fisheries scientists may use gear selectivity to their benefit when targeting specific species or sizes of fishes, thereby enhancing their sampling efficiency. The efficiency of a gear refers to the amount of effort expended to capture target organisms (Box 6. 2). It is generally desirable to maximize the efficiency of a sampling gear to save time and money in single-species assessments of fisheries. Even with efficient sampling gear, the sampling effort needed to estimate the relative abundance and other descriptive statistics for a given species may be unrealistic (Gerow 2007) ...|$|R

The majority of samples were collected near Oregon Inlet, North Carolina with additional samples from New England {{to determine if there}} is a difference in maturation with latitude. Maturation was determined by gross classification of gonads as well as histological examination. Data were compiled based on sex and fish length to elucidate trends. Females collected at lower latitudes were found to have a lower GSI and gonad weight than those from higher latitudes. Males in both locations had a similar GSI and gonad weight based on the length of the fish. At higher latitudes, female fish were immature up to the largest fish collected (124 cm straight fork length (SFL)). Despite fish at lower latitudes having a lower gonadosomatic index (GSI) and gonad weight, beginning stages of oocyte development were present only in females ranging from 110 - 116 cm SFL in these locations. Overall, female fish were found to be in different stages of immaturity whereas a number of male fish were ready to spawn, suggesting that males may mature at a smaller size than females in both locations.

Special thanks to my colleagues in the Cooke Lab who are a source of inspiration, advice and friendship. iii Any time a fish interacts with any structure, anthropogenic or natural, or other animal; there is an opportunity for injury. This thesis compared several presumptive tests for blood commonly used in crime scene analysis (fluorescein, Bluestar©, phenolphthalein, Hemastix®) and their ability to detect and quantify fish epithelial injury. Through a qualitative literature review and comparative field study, fluorescein was found to be the best (i. e., low rate of false positives, detected highest proportion of true positives). Based on this information, fluorescein was investigated further to refine its application in fisheries research. Using fluorescein, injuries could be detected up to 5 hours after the injury occurs and once fluorescein is applied, there is significantly less detectable fluorescein after one hour. Potential sources of injury from recreational <b>angling</b> <b>gear</b> and handling methods were then investigated on northern pike (Esox lucius) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) using fluorescein.
