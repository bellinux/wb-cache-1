The program will not work after the deadline without the 24-character product key. The product key used to activate a copy of Norton Internet Security ties in with <b>an</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> code based on a computer's hardware configuration. Users may activate their product five times with the same product key, however licensing terms dictate users are allowed only to install Norton Internet Security 2004 on one computer.|$|E
5|$|The notes had 150 minor marks that {{acted as}} {{security}} measures to identify forgeries. These were often {{assumed to be}} printing errors, and were changed between issues of notes. Each note bore <b>an</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> serial designation and the signature of the Chief Cashier of the Bank of England. Prior {{to the release of}} any notes by the Bank of England, all serial numbers were recorded in ledgers so the bank could verify its liabilities; these numbers were checked when the notes circulated back through the bank.|$|E
5|$|Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and {{the game}} ends {{immediately}} if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down <b>an</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. In any given scene, the game provides no clues {{as to what the}} player should do next, features no HUD except for an oxygen bar during the swimming sequences, and no on-screen text; and the characters the player meets speak in unintelligible alien language.|$|E

5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes <b>an</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E
5|$|Tracy Hickman and Laura Curtis {{married in}} 1977. Soon after, {{while living in}} Provo, Utah, they wrote the adventures Pharaoh and Ravenloft. When they began work on Ravenloft, they felt the vampire {{archetype}} had become overused, trite, and mundane, and decided to create a frightening version of the creature for the module. They play-tested it {{with a group of}} players every Halloween for five years before it was published in 1983 by TSR. The plot combined elements of the horror genre with Dungeons & Dragons conventions for the first time. At the time of Ravenlofts release, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with <b>an</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> code indicating the series to which it belonged. Ravenloft was labeled I6: the sixth in a series of intermediate-level modules for the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD). It consisted of a 32-page book, with separate maps that detailed locations in the adventure scenario.|$|E
25|$|Tasmania {{introduced}} <b>an</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> route {{numbering system}} in 1979, {{based on the}} British system from 1963. The new system aimed to upgrade the signing of destinations, including previously unmarked roads, and to simplify navigation by allowing visitors to follow numbered routes.

25|$|The world {{generation}} system in Traveller is geared {{to produce a}} highly random mix of worlds. Extensions take star system generation into account, and modify the process depending on the fecundity {{and history of the}} targeted area of space.

25|$|From 1859, the GCR {{identified}} {{different classes}} using <b>an</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> system. The first {{list of classes}} was a simple list of numbers from 1 onward. Number 18 was the highest allocated. Thence, newly built classes received class numbers with a letter suffix rather than using more numbers. By 1923, the '9' series (the largest) had reached '9Q'. Of themselves the letters and numbers had no meaning; {{they appear to have}} been allocated randomly.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Giant" [...] modules {{were set}} in the Greyhawk {{campaign}} setting, and formed the lead-in to an overall campaign that then continued on an odyssey into the Underdark. These adventures included the [...] "Drow" [...] series of modules, Descent into the Depths of the Earth, Shrine of the Kuo-Toa, and Vault of the Drow. The campaign finally culminated with module Queen of the Demonweb Pits. [...] Steading and Glacial Rift were eight pages long, while Hall was 16 pages in length, and each featured an outer folder. The omnibus collection combination module Against the Giants was 32 pages long, and featured two outer folders. Against the Giants was revised and reprinted in the 128-page supermodule Queen of the Spiders in 1986 {{in combination with the}} three [...] "Drow" [...] series modules, and Queen of the Demonweb Pits. Hall of the Fire Giant King marked the first time that Dungeons & Dragons players encountered the drow; game statistics for the drow first appear in the module, although drow are mentioned in the 1977 edition of the Monster Manual. At the time these modules were released, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with <b>an</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> code indicating the series to which it belonged. The earlier modules have module codes G1, G2, and G3 respectively, and the combined module's code is G13. [...] The [...] "G" [...] in the module code represents the first letter in the word [...] "giant". [...] The Original TSR Product Codes for these 3 modules are 9016, 9017, and 9018 respectively. Released in 1999 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of TSR, [...] provided a set of adventuring materials that expanded on the original three modules. 1999 also featured a reprinting of the three modules made available in the Dungeons & Dragons Silver Anniversary Collector's Edition boxed set, with slight modifications to make it distinguishable from the original (for collecting purposes).|$|E
500|$|When Metamorphosis Alpha was updated and {{expanded}} into Gamma World, {{it seemed the}} right time for Gygax to reintroduce Expedition to the Barrier Peaks to the public. Said Gygax, [...] "What could be more logical than to make available a scenario which blends the two role playing approaches into a single form?" [...] Gygax updated the scenario to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD) rules, hoping it could serve as a primer on how to integrate science into one's fantasy role playing game. In 1980, the updated version was published as Expedition to the Barrier Peaks. At the time of Expedition to the Barrier Peakss release, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with <b>an</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> code indicating the series to which it belonged. The 32-page adventure bears the code S3 ("S" [...] for [...] "special"). The module included a 36-page book and a 32-page book, with two outer folders; {{it was one of the}} first deluxe scenario modules, and included a book of illustrations intended to be shown to the players during the game, including four color paintings. This module was included as part of the Realms of Horror abridged compilation produced in 1987. Although an article on the Wizards.com web site did provide a conversion to Future Tech, the adventure never received an official sequel and was not updated for the D version 3.5 rules (Wizards of the Coast periodically alters the rules of Dungeons & Dragons and releases a new version). [...] It was made into a novel of the same name by Roland J. Green for the Greyhawk Classics series. The adventure has also been referenced in the Nodwick comic series. Unlike the other S series adventures, Expedition to the Barrier Peaks was not included in the Dungeon Survival Guide by author Bill Slavicsek because to him it was a [...] "wonderful adventure", but not [...] "a D adventure. Once you add ray guns and power armor to the game, you have a fundamentally different experience." [...] Other products that have introduced futuristic elements into D include the adventure City of the Gods (1987) and the novel Tale of the Comet (1997).|$|E
