5|$|At {{a luncheon}} later that day, however, Miranda announces {{that it is}} Jacqueline instead of Nigel who will leave Runway for Holt. Nigel remarks to a stunned Andy that, though disappointed, he has to believe that his loyalty to Miranda will one day pay off. Later, when Miranda and Andy are being driven to a show, she {{explains}} to a still-stunned Andy that she {{was grateful for the}} warning but already knew of the plot to replace her and sacrificed Nigel to keep her own job. Pleased by this display of loyalty, she tells Andy that she sees a great deal of herself in her. Andy, repulsed, says she could never do that to anyone. Miranda replies that she <b>already</b> <b>did,</b> stepping over Emily when she agreed to go to Paris. When they stop, Andy gets out and throws her cell phone into the fountain of the Place de la Concorde, leaving Miranda, Runway, and fashion behind.|$|E

Some of the Arab countries saw the 'Islamistan' project as a Pakistani attempt to dominate other Muslim states.|$|E

25|$|Decades {{after his}} death, the Nazis {{strongly}} approved of Bruckner's music {{because they saw}} it as expressing the zeitgeist of the German volk, and Hitler even consecrated a bust of Bruckner in a widely photographed ceremony in 1937 at Regensburg's Walhalla temple. Bruckner's music {{was among the most}} popular in Nazi Germany and the Adagio from his Seventh Symphony was broadcast by German radio (Deutscher Reichsrundfunk) when it broadcast the news of Hitler's death on 1 May 1945. However, this did not hurt Bruckner's standing in the postwar media, and several movies and TV productions in Europe and the United States have used excerpts from his music ever since the 1950s, as they <b>already</b> <b>did</b> in the 1930s. Nor did the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra ever ban Bruckner's music as they have Wagner's, even recording the Eighth Symphony with Zubin Mehta.|$|E

In June 2014, the movie was titled Puss in Boots 2: Nine Lives & 40 Thieves and was scheduled to be released on November 2, 2018. Two months later, it was moved back to December 21, 2018. In January 2015, Puss in Boots 2 was removed from the release schedule following corporate restructuring and DreamWorks Animation's new policy to release two films a year. Two months later, Banderas {{said in an interview that}} the script was under restructuring, and that Shrek may appear in the film.|$|E
25|$|One {{night after}} a party, Peggy decides {{to sleep with}} Charlie. He then flips out and reminds {{her that she had}} rebuffed him the weekend before and {{therefore}} believes she is playing games, then drives her home. Instead of going inside, she takes a walk and ends up at an all-night cafe. As she walks by, she sees Michael Fitzsimmons — the artsy loner in school she always wished she’d slept with - and goes in to talk to him. After finding out they have more in common than originally thought, they ride off on his motorcycle. In a field, they smoke weed and find out more about one another. When he asks if she is going to marry Charlie, she responds that she <b>already</b> <b>did</b> that and will not do it again. After he recites some of his poetry for her, they have sex.|$|E

[...] Later, [...] rules were instituted especially to curtail {{the effectiveness of the}} chuck nurse. [...] The use of such repetitive, predictable shots by Spinks, Schaefer Sr. and their contemporaries {{led to the development of}} the more advanced and restrictive 14.1 balkline rules (invented in 1907, but not played professionally until 1914), which further thwarted the ease of reliance on nurse shots than the older balkline games <b>already</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons has had {{crossovers}} {{with four}} other shows. In the episode [...] "A Star Is Burns", Marge invites Jay Sherman, the main character of The Critic, to be a judge for a film festival in Springfield. Matt Groening had his name removed from the episode since he had no involvement with The Critic. South Park later paid homage to The Simpsons with the episode [...] "Simpsons <b>Already</b> <b>Did</b> It". In [...] "Simpsorama", the Planet Express crew from Futurama come to Springfield in the present to prevent the Simpsons from destroying the future. In the Family Guy episode [...] "The Simpsons Guy", the Griffins visit Springfield and meet the Simpsons.|$|E

Patchy then says that they cannot replace him, but Potty tells him that they <b>already</b> <b>did.</b> When Patchy finds out that he's {{been replaced by a}} gorilla, he calls it a [...] "smelly, hairy fleabag", to which the gorilla fiercely responds to by throwing patties at Patchy.

Leslie Nielsen's character from the movie Airplane! wishes Han good luck during their encounter with the TIE fighters. When seeking how to destroy the Death Star, the rebels look at an instructional video hosted by basketball player Magic Johnson. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo's characters from the National Lampoon's Vacation films appear driving by the Death Star.

500|$|Joseph Redding {{defended his}} clients vigorously. [...] His {{argument}} was three-fold. [...] First {{he argued that}} in one hundred years of Indian policy, Congress had never prosecuted Indian-on-Indian crime. [...] Further, the indictment as stated contained no element of commerce and was therefore outside the purview of Congress to legislate such a law. [...] Finally, he argued that such a profound shift in Indian policy should not be enacted in a law whose heading and body were wholly inconsistent {{with the intent of}} the Major Crimes Act. [...] In effect, he argued that such a law governing a people should be debated in full sight of the American public and on its own merits. [...] Redding argued that Congress could not assert power over sovereign people who, when making treaties to cede land, reserved certain rights to themselves. [...] He did not raise the issue that the tribes <b>already</b> <b>did</b> have a system of law that dealt with crimes against another person.|$|E
500|$|Lytle {{also noted}} that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, [...] "It's {{probably}} going to happen.... If anyone knows anything about Grandaddy, they realise that my [...] music and Grandaddy's music is slightly interchangeable. I think if I were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [...] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and I {{like the idea of}} that. I'd like to give it a shot." [...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going {{to get out there and}} tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it.

500|$|Although {{the duke}} had seen navigable aqueducts in use on canals when {{travelling}} abroad on his Grand Tour, {{the idea of}} an such a structure carrying a canal over a river was new to England and was ridiculed by contemporary engineers. One brought in to review the plans, at Brindley's request, commented in a report to the Duke of Bridgewater that [...] "I have often heard of castles in the air, but never before saw where one was to be erected." [...] The necessary Act of Parliament was passed in March 1760, and was quite specific about the form the aqueduct had to take, to protect the viability of the Mersey & Irwell Navigation below. There was already a three-arch road bridge, Barton Bridge, passing over the Irwell, and the aqueduct was required not to restrict traffic on the river any more than the road bridge <b>already</b> <b>did.</b> It had to have the same number of arches, the foundations for which had to be fixed in the river bed, and the arches had to be at least as wide and high as those of the road bridge.|$|E
500|$|Like the {{previous}} two Treehouse of Horror episodes, [...] "Treehouse of Horror VII" [...] does not feature any wraparound segments. [...] "The Thing and I" [...] was written by Ken Keeler, [...] "The Genesis Tub" [...] was written by Dan Greaney, and [...] "Citizen Kang" [...] was written by David X. Cohen. Despite the similarities, [...] "The Thing and I" [...] was not based on {{the plot of the}} 1982 film Basket Case. [...] "The Genesis Tub" [...] was originally pitched by Cohen, and it was later referenced in the South Park episode [...] "Simpsons <b>Already</b> <b>Did</b> It", when they pointed out that The Simpsons had gotten the idea from the 1962 Twilight Zone episode called [...] "The Little People". The sequence where tiny spaceships attack Bart in [...] "The Genesis Tub" [...] marks one of the first uses of computers in The Simpsons animation. The computer was used to build models for reference and the animators later retraced it. The 1996 Presidential election occurred {{a few days after the}} airing of this episode. According to Cohen, the [...] "Citizen Kang" [...] short violated every rule of The Simpsons as it locked the episode in one time and named specific candidates.|$|E
500|$|Stone said {{in writing}} the episode, they were {{determined}} not to produce a clip show, but to merge all of the old ideas into a new, original script. The process proved challenging for the duo because it involved incorporating many ideas, subplots and characters into a single episode. Parker and Stone included a joke about this process {{at the start of}} the episode, when Cartman and Kyle are fighting with each other, and Stan accuses them of just [...] "rehashing a bunch of old stuff". In honor of the 200th episode, the website SouthPark200.com was launched, offering a forum to fans to post their congratulations to South Park and view those posted by others. Various people have contributed to the site, including the creators of the animated series The Simpsons (who used the opportunity to revisit another previous South Park theme, the episode [...] "Simpsons <b>Already</b> <b>Did</b> It", saying [...] "We already [...] Twice."), members of the rock band Rush and Denver Nuggets basketball player Chauncey Billups. The site also includes congratulations from All in the Family creator Norman Lear, who guest-starred in the 100th episode [...] "I'm a Little Bit Country", and figure skater Brian Boitano, who was featured in the song [...] "What Would Brian Boitano Do?"
