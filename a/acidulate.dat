6000|$|Do not {{attribute}} it to indolence that I {{have not}} written to you. Suspense {{has been the}} real cause of my silence. Day after day I have confidently expected some decisive letter, and as often have been disappointed. [...] "Certainly I shall have one to-morrow noon, and then I will write." [...] Thus I contemplated {{the time of my}} silence in its small component parts, forgetful into what a sum total they were swelling. As I have heard nothing from Nottingham notwithstanding I have written a pressing letter, I have, by the advice of Cottle and Dr. Beddoes, accepted a proposal of Mr. Perry's, the editor of the [...] "Morning Chronicle",--accepted it with a heavy and reluctant heart. On Thursday Perry was at Bristol for a few hours, just time enough to attend the dying moments of his associate in the editorship, Mr. Grey, whom Dr. Beddoes attended. Perry desired Dr. B. to inform me that, if I would come up to London and write for him, he would make me a regular compensation adequate to the maintenance of myself and Mrs. Coleridge, and requested an immediate answer by the post. Mr. Estlin, and Charles Danvers, and Mr. Wade are or were all out of town;--I had no one to advise with except Dr. Beddoes and Cottle. Dr. B. thinks it a good opening on account of Grey's death; but I rather think that the intention is to employ me as a mere hackney without any share of the profits. However, as I am doing nothing, and in the prospect of doing nothing settled, I was afraid to give way to the [...] "omenings" [...] of my heart; and accordingly I accepted his proposal in general terms, requesting a line from him expressing the particulars both of my proposed occupation and stipend. This I shall receive to-morrow, I suppose; and if I do, I think of hiring a horse for a couple of days, and galloping down to you to have all your advice, which indeed, if it should be for rejecting the proposals, I might receive by post; but if for finally accepting them, we could not interchange letters in a time sufficiently short for Perry's needs, and so he might procure another person possibly. At all events I should not like to leave this part of England--perhaps for ever--without seeing you once more. I am very sad about it, for I love Bristol, and I do not love London; and besides, local and temporary politics have become my aversion. They narrow the understanding, and at least <b>acidulate</b> the heart; but those two giants, yclept Bread and Cheese, bend me into compliance. I must do something. If I go, farewell, Philosophy! farewell, the Muse! farewell, my literary Fame! ...|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the etching effects of acidulated fluoride gels on high-glass-content restorations and to compare these effects with different <b>acidulating</b> systems. Samples of KetacFil, Fuji IX, Z 100 and porcelain were separately submerged into either test solutions of 1. 23 % acidulated fluoride gel (APF) or solutions of the individual acidic components of APF (HF or H 3 PO 4) combined with fluoride ions for 1 – 20 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the Fuji IX samples were exposed to the potential alternative <b>acidulating</b> solutions (polyacrylic, malic, maleic and tartaric acids) for similar time periods and assessed for roughness using profilometry and/or Scanning Electron Microscopy. The results showed that the GICs were most rapidly and extensively etched by the APF solutions. However, porcelain was etched less rapidly and Z 100 showed no etching. Of the acidulated fluoride solutions tested, malic and maleic acids showed the greatest etching effect on Fuji IX followed by APF, HFF, tartaric acid, PAA and HPF. In conclusion, the <b>acidulating</b> system containing ortho-phosphoric acid showed the least rapid etching effects, although these effects were still a concern with long term exposure...|$|R

40|$|OBJETIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the anticariogenic effect of <b>acidulate</b> {{solutions}} with low NaF concentration, using pH-cycling model and bovine enamel. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Enamel blocks were submitted to the surface microhardness (SMH) test and randomly divided in 12 experimental and one placebo groups. The blocks were submitted to pH cycling for 7 days, with daily applications once/day of 0. 05 % NaF and 0. 1 % NaF and twice/day of 0. 02 % NaF solutions. Four different pH: 4. 0, 5. 0, 6. 0 and 7. 0 were used. Next, SMH test was again used to determine the surface microhardness percentage change (%SMH). Data obtained for %SMH were homogeneous and passed through variance analyses and Tukey's test (5 %) as far as fluoride concentrations and pH. RESULTS:The results showed that pH influenced %SMH in 0. 02 % NaF and 0. 05 % NaF solutions with pH 4. 0, which had less mineral loss compared to pH 7. 0 (p 0. 05). A dose-response relationship was observed among the tested solutions, with better anticariogenic effect for the 0. 1 % NaF solution. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the addition of citric acid to <b>acidulate</b> mouth rinses reduce mineral loss...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of pre and post fluoride therapy on the microleakage of composite resin and glass ionomer restorations. Materials and Methods: Class V cavities were prepared on the buccal surfaces of sixty extracted human third molars. Based on the restorative materials the samples were assigned into two essential groups of thirty and each of them divided into three subgroups regarding the mode of <b>Acidulate</b> Phosphate Fluoride (APF) gel usage. Fluoride therapy was applied pre and post restoration whether OptiBond Solo Plus as a total-etch adhesive system with Herculite XRV as a light cured composite resin or Fuji II LC glass ionomer as an restoration. Each essential group contained a control group without fluoride therapy. Thermo cycling was done, and then the rate of microleakage was evaluated by the fluid filtration method. Results: There were no significant differences by pre and post-treatment with APF on microleakage of composite resin restorations. A significant difference was found on microleakage of glass ionomer restorations based on different APF therapy. Conclusions: In contrast to composite resin restoration which had not influenced by fluoride therapy, after glass ionomer placement, the gel of fluoride led to significantly increase the microleakage of the restoration...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{source of}} streptococci in milk is the cow's udder. The udder streptococci {{fall into two}} broad groups; those of the larger group agree in cultural characters and agglutination affinities with mastitis streptococci; the smaller group is composed of low acid-producing streptococci. The streptococci of the latter group produce clear zones of hemolysis about surface and deep colonies in horse blood agar plates. They attack dextrose, lactose, saccharose, and maltose, but do not ferment raffinose, inulin, mannite, or salicin. Acid production in dextrose {{by the members of}} this group is about the same as that produced by human streptococci under the same conditions. The limiting hydrogen ion concentration for these pleomorphic udder streptococci in dextrose serum bouillon is within the limits of the limiting hydrogen ion concentration observed by Avery and Cullen for human streptococci. All the streptococci from the vagina, saliva, skin, and feces have been non-hemolytic. Those from the saliva form a heterogeneous aggregation in which individuals fermenting raffinose, inulin, and mannite predominate. From the skin a characteristic streptococcus has been found. It produces acid in dextrose, lactose, saccharose, maltose, raffinose, mannite, and salicin, but fails to <b>acidulate</b> media containing inulin. The fecal streptococci are characterized by the formation of large amounts of acid in dextrose, lactose, saccharose, maltose, raffinose, inulin, and salicin. Mannite is not fermented. Neither the fecal nor the skin streptococci have been isolated from the bottled milk with any great frequency...|$|E
40|$|Precursors of {{chromium}} oxide (p-Cr 2 O 3) were prepared by reducing hexavalent chromium {{in the presence}} of sodium carbonate solution under hydrothermal conditions. Methanal was used as the reductant, and carbon dioxide was the <b>acidulating</b> agent. The influences of reaction temperature, initial pressure of carbon dioxide, isothermal time and methanal coefficient on Cr(VI) reduction were investigated. Experimental results showed that Cr(VI) was reduced to Cr(III) with a yield of 99 %. Chemical titration, thermogravimetry (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the p-Cr 2 O 3 and Cr 2 O 3. The series of p-Cr 2 O 3 were found to be multiphase even if they presented different colors, from gray green to lavender.

40|$|Fruit leathers (FLs) {{production}} produces some not-to-specification material, {{which contains}} valuable ingredients like fruit pulp, sugars and <b>acidulates.</b> Recovery of FL for product recycling requires decolorization. In earlier research, we proved {{the efficiency of}} an ozone-based decolorization process; however, it produces carbonyls as major byproducts, which could be of concern. A headspace solid-phase microextraction with on-fiber derivatization followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was developed for 10 carbonyls analysis in ozonated FL solution/suspension. Effects of dopant concentration, derivatization temperature and time were studied. The adapted method was used to analyze ozonated FL solution/suspension samples. Dopant concentration and derivatization temperature were optimized to 17 mg/mL and 60 °C, respectively. Competitive extraction was studied, and 5 s extraction time was used to avoid non-linear derivatization of 2 -furfural. The detection limits (LODs) for target carbonyls ranged from 0. 016 and 0. 030 µg/L. A much lower LOD (0. 016 ppb) for 2 -furfural was achieved compared with 6 and 35 ppb in previous studies. Analysis results confirmed the robustness of the adapted method for quantification of carbonyls in recycled process water treated with ozone-based decolorization. Ethanal, hexanal, 2 -furfural, and benzaldehyde were identified as byproducts of known toxicity but all found below levels for concern...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{of final}} product is to great extent {{influenced}} by intermediate {{products that are}} formed during beer production. In addition quality of pH {{is one of the}} most important properties that forms suitable medium for activity of enzymes complexes that have crucial influence on character of produced wort. Moreover enzymes influence the yield of production process and quality of final product as well. Quality of boiling water and especially its hardness have crucial task in terms of keeping optimal qualitative parameters. Water hardness is given by amount of salts, mainly calcium and magnesium salts. It is expressed as absolute hardness which is given by sum of temporary (carbonate) and permanent (noncarbonate) hardness. In our work we solved the effect of total water hardness on final pH of various intermediate products. We used different water samples and we prepared variants of total hardness by stirring of unpurified water with distilled water thus we achieved various values of hardness. For comparison we prepared several brews with regard to combinations of unpurified water and distilled water. Higher pH of boiling water was caused due to higher water alkalinity that negatively affected enzyme complex present in used malt. Presence of hydrogenphosphates in used malt had high buffering ability and pH lowering ability. Such unfavorable result could be adjust by use of various additions of <b>acidulates</b> that would have in great extent influence on beer final price therefore boiling water adjustment seems to be the most acceptable approach...|$|R
40|$|The lower nasal mucosa and the pharynx {{of thirty}} eastern and twenty-three western horses have been {{examined}} for streptococci. Eight of the eastern horses carried non-hemolytic streptococci on the nasal mucosa. From the pharynx of six, non-hepiolytic streptococci were cultivated. The throats of eighteen contained strains of the hemolytic type. The nasal mucosa of the eastern horses failed to show hemolytic streptococci. Eight western horses carried non-hemolytic streptococci in the nasal passage; eight also harbored the hemolytic type. Twenty-two strains were isolated from the pharynx. Eleven were hemolytic. Among all the non-hemolytic nasal strains those capable of fermenting mannite predominate. Those of the non-hemolytic types from the pharynx of both classes of horses {{may or may not}} ferment lactose but all do ferment either raffinose or inulin. In no instance have any of the non-hemolytic types proved pathogenic for mice. The hemolytic strains from the nasal mucosa of the western horses were all of the Streptococcus py genes type. They were pathogenic for mice and rabbits. One strain from the pharynx of an eastern horse and eight from the throats of the western horses were of the same species. All the others corresponded closely in their fermentation reactions with non-hemolytic streptococci from the same region. The streptococci from pathological sources were all hemolytic. They have fallen into two groups; the larger group (Streptococcus pyogenes) produced acid in dextrose, lactose, saccharose, maltose, milk, and salicin but failed to change the reaction of broth containing raffinose, inulin, or mannite. The streptococci of the smaller group (Streptococcus equi) differ only in their inability to ferment lactose or <b>acidulate</b> milk. Both types are pathogenic for mice. Rabbits are usually more resistant. Streptococcus pyogenes has been isolated from eighteen of twenty-two cases of influenza, three of six cases of strangles, and from eight of nine abscesses. Streptococcus equi was observed in four horses suffering from influenza and five others affected with strangles. This species was also found in an abscess and associated with both rhinitis and pharyngitis...|$|E
40|$|Unlike the {{top-down}} approach of conventional research, participatory research methods offer a bottomup approach, involving all major stakeholders {{from the beginning}} of a research project. Integration of the end users of research (i. e. farmers) enhances the acceptance and adoption of innovations, along with making the best use of the local knowledge that is available. The Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL), Switzerland – one of the world’s leading institutions in the field of organic agricultural research – participates in numerous international projects, involving research, consultancy, training and development cooperation. With the objective of providing sound scientific information by comparative analysis of various agricultural management systems (e. g. conventional, organic, biodynamic), FiBL initiated a long term research programme in 2007, called the Farming Systems Comparison in the Tropics (SysCom). Participatory On-farm Research (POR) is a strong component of the SysCom programme, along with Long Term Experiments (LTEs) running on four research sites across three tropical countries (Kenya, India and Bolivia). POR involves the active participation of various stakeholders, including local farmers, extension workers, trade/industry partners and researchers, in problem identification, exploration of possible solutions and testing of the proposed innovations. Experiments are conducted on both research farms (mother trials) and farmers’ fields (baby trials). Effective use of local knowledge and locally available resources is a priority in our POR work. Our participatory research activities on homemade organic pesticides and enhancing phosphorus availability have shown remarkable success. We have developed a methodology to produce compost enriched with <b>acidulate</b> rock phosphate (RP) using locally available materials and have standardized the methodologies for preparation of various botanical pesticides. To address the strong demand for organic cottonseed, we started participatory breeding activities that have developed into a large-scale breeding project (Green Cotton Project). In addition to the local farmers, we work in participation with an industrial partner (bioRe India) in Madhya Pradesh state, India; bioRe ensures the supply of inputs and procurement/marketing of organic cotton produced by the local farmers. The SysCom programme is financially supported by a coordination committee of donors comprised of various public and private funding bodies. Backstopping by a well-qualified scientific advisory board ensures that the research conducted in SysCom meets international standards. This case study describes the success of this partnership between farmers, researchers, public and private institutions...|$|E
40|$|Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) {{cannot be}} {{directly}} {{used as an}} organic fertilizer source due to its high Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) thus it is not environmentally safely. To increase the high quality of organic fertilizer obtained, the liquid wastes are needed to be processed in order to decrease the BOD to degrade both the soluble and suspension materials of organic materials. The altenative process to be conducted {{to make a better}} quality of POME is by adding the adsorbent. The aim of the research was to study the effect of zeolite utilization and duration of hydrolysis process in order to increase the nutrients content and to decrease the BOD of POME. The research was conducted at the PT Sumbertama Nusa Pertiwi Jambi, Indonesia in August 2012 until February 2013. The sample of POME was taken from the inlet of the factory’s <b>acidulating</b> pool. There were several doses of zeolite as treatments which were 0, 5, 10, 15 % and several durations of hydrolysis process which were 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks. Active zeolite was added to POME and then it was fermented with different hydrolysis duration times as mentioned above. The research showed that application of zeolite and duration of hydrolysis process significantly affected the pH, N, P, K, Al, Fe, BOD of POME and the adsorption of N, P, K, Al, Fe by zeolite. It can be concluded that 10 % of zeolite incubated in two weeks duration of hydrolysis process produced higher nutrient of N, P, K with BOD, Al, Fe and pH matched with the waste quality standard.

40|$|Commercial {{manufacture}} of fruit leathers (FL) usually {{results in a}} portion of the product that is out of specification. The disposition of this material poses special challenges in the food industry. Because the material remains edible and contains valuable ingredients (fruit pulp, sugars, <b>acidulates,</b> etc.), an ideal solution would be to recover this material for product rework. A key practical obstacle to such recovery is that compositing of differently colored wastes results in an unsalable gray product. Therefore, a safe and scalable method for decolorization of FL prior to product rework is needed. This research introduces a novel approach utilizing ozonation for color removal. To explore the use of ozonation as a decolorization step, we first applied it to simple solutions of the commonly used food colorants 2 -naphthalenesulfonic acid (Red 40), tartrazine (Yellow 5), and erioglaucine (Blue 1). Decolorization was measured by UV/vis spectrometry at visible wavelengths and with a Hunter colorimeter. Volatile and semivolatile byproducts from ozone-based colorant decomposition were identified and quantified with solid phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS). Removal of Yellow 5, Red 40 and Blue 1 of about 65 %, 80 %, and 90 %, respectively, was accomplished with 70 g of ozone applied per 1 kg of redissolved and resuspended FL. Carbonyl compounds were identified as major byproducts from ozone-induced decomposition of the food colorants. A conservative risk assessment based on quantification results and published toxicity information of potentially toxic byproducts, determined that ozone-based decolorization of FL before recycling is acceptable from a safety standpoint. A preliminary cost estimate based on recycling of 1000 tons of FL annually suggests a potential of $ 275, 000 annual profit from this practice at one production facility alone...|$|R
40|$|High soil pH {{levels may}} limit the {{availability}} of phosphorous (P) to crops. In organic farming, the use of synthetic P fertilizers is not allowed. Application of rock phosphate (RP) to crops {{is one of the}} alternatives for organic production. However, RP application shows little effect on high pH soils, because the P is not transformed into plant-available forms under alkaline soil conditions. Aiming at the development of locally adapted solutions, we followed a Participatory Technology Development approach, making use of the local knowledge to identify current practices and associated problems by conducting focus group discussions with organic farmers. Farmers stated that they are facing challenges with a P limitation in their cotton-based production systems. In 2011 - 12, on-station trials with maize, green gram and wheat investigated the potential of several locally available materials to solubilize RP (phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (PSB), tamarind fruits, local vinegar from mahua trees (Madhuca longifolia), butter milk (BM), incubating RP into compost). The results of these trials showed that the two most promising options for solubilizing RP were BM and Mahua Vinegar (MV). Further on-station trials in 2012 - 13 investigated the effects of BM and MV more closely, focusing on incubation periods and ratios of RP:acidifying liquids. Another study looked at technologies for improved farm yard manure (FYM) management. Results suggested that <b>acidulating</b> RP with BM for a period of one week in a ratio BM:RP = 10 : 1 leads to a good solubilization of RP. Furthermore, the so-called “shaded shallow-pit system”, which was favored by local farmers, best conserved the quality of FYM as a fertilizer. Subsequently, the information of the two studies was combined, and the production of RP-enriched FYM (RP-FYM) by five local lead farmers was initiated in 2012. The RP-FYM produced was distributed to associated farmers (4 per lead farmer) to set up several on-farm trials with cotton and soybean in 2013 - 14.

40|$|The {{commercial}} production of fruit leathers results in some {{material that is}} not to specification. Although this product remains edible and contains valuable ingredients such as fruit pulp, sugars and <b>acidulates,</b> it is not salable and its disposal is costly. Because these products are typically highly colored, recovery of fruit leather for recycling into the product requires colorant removal to avoid an unappetizing brownish color from the mixture of colorants. This research introduces a novel approach utilizing ozonation for color removal. The treatment was first applied to pure solutions of the commonly used food colorants 2 -naphthalenesulfonic acid (Red 40), tartrazine (Yellow 5), and erioglaucine (Blue 1). Color removal was measured by UV/Vis spectrometer, and a Hunter colorimeter. Byproducts from ozone-based colorant decomposition were identified and quantified with SPME-GC-MS. Removal of Yellow 5, Red 40 and Blue 1 was about 65 %, 80 % and 90 % complete, respectively, with 70 g ozone applied to 1 kg aqueous fruit leather suspension solution. Given the known structures of these dyes, a concern with this approach is the potential formation of toxic ozonolysis byproducts. In initial work, carbonyl compounds were identified as major byproducts. Among these, benzaldehyde, 2 -furfural, ethanal and hexanal were identified as byproducts of known toxicity at levels sufficient for concern. A head-space solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) method with on-fiber derivatization using o-(2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxylamine hydrochloride (PFBHA) was optimized for detection and quantification of carbonyl compounds in ozonated fruit leather suspensions. Ethanal, hexanal, furfural and benzaldehyde were quantified with the newly developed method, and detection limits were in the range of 0. 016 - 0. 030 yg/L. For furfural, the ozonolysis byproduct noted in the literature as having the highest median lethal dose value, the maximum amount generated was determined to be under the detection limit, 0. 016 yg/L of 100 % fruit leather solution/suspension, while hexanal was the most abundantly generated, at 80. 0 y 22. 0 mg/L. A conservative risk assessment based on published toxicity information for the main ozonolysis products generated in this study suggests the acceptability of ozone-based decolorization in fruit leather recycling. A preliminary cost estimate suggests a potential $ 0. 25 million annual profit on recycling a 1, 000 tons of waste fruit leathers per year...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Rice is {{the object}} plant for the {{research}} and a rice transplanter {{was used as a}} variable rate machine to carry and apply variable amount of fertilizer in the field. A machine driven underground applying skill was used and it could reduce 40 % chemical application comparing with manual application. The applying times could be down 2 to 3 times as well, yet increasing the yield. Since the chemical was buried in the soil, it would not be washed out. In addition, it would reduce the pollution on the land as well as avoid <b>acidulating</b> the soil. Therefore, a device for applying chemicals underground was developed attaching to a Kubota SPA 85 rice transplanter. A local compound chemical, # 5, was used in the research. The applying amount was about 60 % of the recommending amount from Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute, 375 — 675 kg/Ha. In the rice field, applying in alternate line and applying certain amount of chemical between two plantlets were considered. The quantity of chemical to be applied on each spot was ranged from 8. 8 grams to 2. 6 grams. There were six scales used for different requests, 8. 8 g, 7. 8 g, 6. 8 g, 5. 8 g, 4. 8 g and 3. 8 g. A regression equation, Y = 2. 309 + 1. 997 X, was developed for applying the six scales using various displacements of an adjustable finger shaped block. The applying depth was about 8 to 10 cm. There was a delivering wheel designed to rotate to transfer chemical associated with an adjustable finger shaped block, which is driven by a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) based servomotor for 6 chemical rates. The wheel moves back and forth to deliver chemicals. This wheel is concaved and is able to hold chemical and let the chemical drop into a collecting cup then through an output hose into soil. The power to drive the wheel comes from the transplanting finger of the transplanter so that the chemical application is able to work simultaneously with the transplanting. The capacity of each tank is about 20 kg and filling four of them can supply 1000 m 2 field. The error for the variable rate was tested and was less than 3 %. 本研究係以水稻為目標作物，利用水稻插秧機做變率施肥之主體，同時採用深層施肥之方式。機械深層施肥較人工施肥可節省肥料用量約 40 %，減少施肥 2 － 3 次，提高產量。同時因肥料埋在土壤中不會流失，可減少肥料對環境之污染及因過度施肥造成土壤酸化之情形。本研究旨在研製一深層施肥裝置附掛在久保田SPA 85 乘坐式插秧機上，同時依土壤肥力做變率施肥，使其能達插秧與施肥同步進行。本施肥機採用台肥 5 號複合肥料，而機械施肥之施肥量約為作物施肥手冊推薦量之 60 %，為 375 － 675 kg/Ha。採隔行在兩秧苗中間定量施肥，其每點施肥量在 8. 8 g至 2. 6 g，故取六段施肥量為每施肥點分別施肥 8. 8 g， 7. 8 g， 6. 8 g， 5. 8 g， 4. 8 g及 3. 8 g，而根據施肥量和施肥爪位移量實驗得肥料輸出方程式為Y= 2. 309 + 1. 977 X。施肥深度約 8 － 10 公分並覆土，肥料配出由施肥輪作動，肥料輪上有施肥爪，利用可程式控制器（PLC）控制伺服馬達調整施肥爪之位移以達六段施肥控制，施肥輪作迴轉運動如棘輪之作動，使肥料自施肥輪凹槽中落入集肥杯及肥料輸出管而掉入土壤中。施肥輪之動力來自插秧機之插植爪，故能與插植爪同步動作。施肥機之肥料桶肥料容量每桶約為 20 kg，四個施肥桶裝滿可作 1000 m 2 面積施肥。施肥機經田間實際操作再改良，經試驗六段變率施肥，其誤差小於 3 ﹪。第一章 前言 第二章 文獻探討 第三章 理論計算與設計 第四章 結果與討論 第五章 結論與建...|$|R
