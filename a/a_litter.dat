5|$|Because {{ovulation}} is {{not always}} triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate. Furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate {{with more than one}} male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in <b>a</b> <b>litter</b> may have different fathers.|$|E
5|$|During the Seminole Indian War in 1836, Foster {{served as}} a colonel of a mounted infantry, but was seriously wounded and carried on <b>a</b> <b>litter</b> for 50 miles. He {{recovered}} and joined the Georgia Militia in 1842, becoming aide-de-camp for the Commander-in-Chief. Foster was subsequently commissioned brigadier general of the 2nd Brigade of the 7th Division in 1845.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{particularly}} steep descent the following day, half of Mawson's team of dogs—reattached to his sledges—were almost lost when they {{fell into a}} crevasse.

5|$|Hagenbeck's modern zoo {{techniques}} proved effective, and Edinburgh quickly {{gained a}} reputation for its good animal conditions. 1934 saw the births in captivity of a sea lion and beaver, and in 1936 a baby chimpanzee followed. <b>A</b> <b>litter</b> of wolves was born in 1938, and soon afterwards the first orangutan to be born in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In January 1566 Sultan Suleiman I {{had ruled}} the Ottoman Empire for 46 years {{and went to}} war for the last time. He was 72 years old and, {{although}} having gout {{to the extent that}} he was carried on <b>a</b> <b>litter,</b> he nominally commanded his thirteenth military campaign. On 1 May 1566 the Sultan left Constantinople at the head of one of the largest armies he had ever commanded.|$|E
5|$|On 8 September 1973, a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb {{exploded}} at the ticket office in Victoria Station, London, injuring five people.

5|$|Theobald {{called a}} church council at London in June 1160, which dealt partly {{with the issues}} of the papal schism; his health was poor and he had to be taken to the council in <b>a</b> <b>litter.</b> A further cause of {{distress}} to Theobald was what he saw as the ingratitude of Becket, who did not visit the ailing archbishop.|$|E
5|$|After {{five hours}} of fighting, the troops subdued the Comanche resistance. Buffalo Hump escaped, but 70 Comanches were killed or mortally wounded, only two of them noncombatants. Ross's {{injuries}} were severe, and for five days he lay under a tree on the battlefield, unable to be moved. His wounds became infected, and Ross begged the others to kill him to end his pain. When {{he was able to}} travel, he was first carried on <b>a</b> <b>litter</b> suspended between two mules, and then on the shoulders of his men. He recovered fully, but experienced some pain for {{much of the rest of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|Capybara {{gestation}} is 130–150 days, {{and produces}} <b>a</b> <b>litter</b> of four capybara young on average, but may produce {{between one and}} eight in a single litter. Birth is on land and the female rejoins the group {{within a few hours}} of delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group as soon as they are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but continue to suckle—from any female in the group—until weaned around 16 weeks. The young form a group within the main group. Alloparenting has been observed in this species. Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in Mato Grosso, Brazil.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the allelopathic effect of Axonopus compressus litter on Asystasia gangetica and Pennisetum polystachion. In experiment 1 the bioassays with 0, 10, 30, and 50 [*]g[*]L− 1 of aqueous <b>A.</b> compressus <b>litter</b> leachate were conducted. Experiment 2 {{was carried out by}} incorporating 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 [*]g[*]L− 1 of <b>A.</b> compressus <b>litter</b> leachate into soil. In experiment 3, the fate of <b>A.</b> compressus <b>litter</b> leachate phenolics in the soil was investigated. A. compressus leachates did not affect the germination percentage of A. gangetica and P. polystachion, but delayed germination of A. gangetica seeds and decreased seed germination time of P. polystachion. <b>A.</b> compressus <b>litter</b> leachates affected weeds hypocotyl length. Hypocotyl length reductions of 18 and 31 % were observed at the highest concentration (50 [*]g[*]L− 1) compared to the control in A. gangetica and P. polystachion, respectively. When concentration of <b>A.</b> compressus <b>litter</b> leachate-amended soil increased A. gangetica and P. polystachion seedling shoot length, root length, seedling weight and chlorophyll concentration were not affected. The 5 -week decomposition study of A. compressus showed that the phenolic compounds in <b>A.</b> compressus <b>litter</b> abruptly decreased about 52 % after two weeks and remained steady {{until the end of the}} incubation...|$|R
5|$|Charles V of France {{maintained}} {{the terms of}} the treaty of Brétigny but encouraged others in Aquitaine to challenge the authority of the Plantagenets in Aquitaine. The prince, who had suffered a debilitating illness for nearly a decade which often restricted his movement to being carried in <b>a</b> <b>litter,</b> returned to England, where he soon died. John of Gaunt assumed leadership in France with limited success, and peace negotiations over several years were inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was carried}} back to Chinon on <b>a</b> <b>litter,</b> {{where he was}} {{informed}} that John had publicly sided with Richard in the conflict. This desertion proved the final shock and he finally collapsed into a fever, only coming to {{for a few moments}} during which he gave confession. Henry died on 6 July 1189, aged 56; the King had wished to be interred at Grandmont Abbey in the Limousin, but the hot weather made transporting his body impractical and he was instead buried at the nearby Fontevraud Abbey.|$|E
5|$|It {{is active}} {{throughout}} the year, primarily at night. Gestation {{is about three}} weeks, and the female has <b>a</b> <b>litter</b> {{of three or four}} young. Nests in the wild, built from shredded bark, are in a tunnel or under a log. Marsh shrews typically live about 18 months, and males are not thought to reach sexual maturity during their first summer. Since their lifespan is short, they apparently breed for only one season. Although no breeding data exist for British Columbia, the breeding season elsewhere is from late January to late August; most young are born in March. The number of litters a female rears is unknown.|$|E
50|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} {{four to six}} weeks after birth, but males do not breed during their first summer. Normally, only <b>a</b> single <b>litter</b> is born each year, but, in at least some localities, <b>a</b> second <b>litter</b> may be born in August. They live for up to four years.|$|R
50|$|Under Directive 1999/74/EC, {{furnished}} cages {{must provide}} {{at least the}} following: 750 cm2 per hen, of which 600 cm2 is 45 cm high, <b>a</b> nest, <b>a</b> <b>littered</b> area for scratching and pecking, 15 cm of perch and 12 cm of food trough per hen and a claw shortening device.|$|R

5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the finless sleeper ray can {{generate}} a defensive electric shock from paired electric organs in its disc. It gives birth to live young, with the developing embryos nourished by yolk. <b>A</b> <b>litter</b> size of four has been recorded from one individual. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the finless sleeper ray as Vulnerable. This slow-reproducing species is caught by intensive bottom trawl and possibly other fisheries throughout its range, which likely cause high mortality {{regardless of whether it}} is discarded or utilised.|$|E
5|$|The Yunnan hare is a diurnal species, {{but is also}} active {{during the}} night to forage. It is an herbivore, and forages on shrubs and forbs. According to reports by hunters, the adult Yunnan hare has three burrows; those of the male are shallower, smaller, and straighter {{than those of the}} female that are oval and larger in shape.Breeding usually commences in April. There are one to four, usually two, young in <b>a</b> <b>litter,</b> and in May, the female gives two or three litters.|$|E
5|$|The {{gestation}} period for cats is between 64 and 67 days, {{with an average}} of 66 days. The size of <b>a</b> <b>litter</b> usually is three to five kittens, with the first litter usually smaller than subsequent litters. Kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks old, and cats normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months (females) and to 5–7 months (males), although this can vary depending on breed. Females can have two to three litters per year, so may produce up to 150 kittens in their breeding span of around ten years.|$|E
50|$|Cross-fostering young {{animals is}} usually done to {{equalize}} litter size. Individual animals born in large litters {{are faced with}} much more competition for resources, such as breast milk, food and space, than individuals born in smaller litters. Herd managers will typically move some individuals from <b>a</b> large <b>litter</b> to <b>a</b> smaller <b>litter</b> {{where they will be}} raised by a non-biological parent. This is typically done in pig farming because litters with up to 15 piglets are common. A sow with <b>a</b> large <b>litter</b> may have difficulty producing enough milk for all piglets, or the sow may not have enough functional teats to feed all piglets simultaneously. When this occurs, smaller or weaker piglets are at risk of starving to death. Herd managers will often transfer some piglets from <b>a</b> large <b>litter</b> to another lactating sow which either has <b>a</b> smaller <b>litter</b> or has had her own biological piglets recently weaned. Herd managers will typically try to equalize litters by number and also weight of individuals. When done successfully, cross-fostering reduces piglet mortality.|$|R

5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the fisher lasts almost a year. Female fishers give birth to <b>a</b> <b>litter</b> {{of three or four}} kits in the spring. They nurse and care for their kits until late summer, when they are old enough to set out on their own. Females enter estrus shortly after giving birth and leave the den to find a mate. Implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until the following spring, when they give birth and the cycle is renewed.|$|E
5|$|Wellard is {{a fictional}} Belgian Tervuren dog from the BBC soap opera EastEnders. He first {{appeared}} in the series on 18 October 1994, and became EastEnders longest-serving pet, before being killed off on 15 August 2008. Although the character is male, he has been played primarily by three female dogs: Zenna, her daughter Chancer, and her granddaughter Kyte. A fourth dog briefly served as a replacement for Zenna in 1996, when she was given time off from the show to have <b>a</b> <b>litter</b> of puppies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Donna {{accepts the}} Doctor's {{original}} offer to travel in the TARDIS.

She makes a detour to leave her car keys in <b>a</b> <b>litter</b> bin, telling her mother Sylvia to collect them later. While there, she meets a blonde woman and asks her to help Sylvia find the keys. The woman turns out to be Rose Tyler, who fades from view as she walks away from the area. In the final scene, Donna asks the Doctor to fly by her grandfather, Wilfred. He sees her in his telescope and celebrates on his allotment.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{is within}} 3 to 5 years of age.
