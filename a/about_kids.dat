500|$|A {{number of}} critics {{took issue with}} what they {{interpreted}} as the film's underlying messages. San Francisco Chronicle critic Mick Lasalle wrote in his parental advisory that [...] "basically, this is a movie <b>about</b> <b>kids</b> who go into another world and dimension and spend the whole time killing people." [...] MSNBC reviewer Alonso Duralde noted that [...] "all the heroes have British accents while the Telmarines are all decidedly Mediterranean in appearance and inflection". An Anglican Journal review described the movie as reasonably faithful to the adventure elements of the book, much lighter on the religious faith aspects, which they found integral to the novel, and deficient on character and emotion.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times Denise Martin {{also enjoyed}} the episode, writing: [...] "I don't know how Glee keeps topping itself—it just does!" [...] Martin too praised the {{performance}} of [...] "Somebody to Love", writing: [...] "Love or hate Queen, when New Directions sings it, it's magical. And it's {{the first time since}} 'Don't Stop Believin' that I got goosebumps. Something <b>about</b> <b>kids</b> singing songs, raising all those arms, makes everyone—can't just be me!—giddy and hopeful. They're not as technically skilled as [...] Vocal Adrenaline—yet—but that only makes their underdog story more real." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly also called [...] "The Rhodes Not Taken" [...] the best episode of Glee so far, deeming all the musical numbers [...] "fantastic". Eric Goldman for IGN rated the episode 8.5/10. He felt that Chenoweth was [...] "terrific" [...] as April, and that the character was a [...] "hysterical creation". Goldman assessed that the episode [...] "soared" [...] musically, though felt that its resolution was [...] "rushed" [...] and [...] "forced", suggesting that the series has yet to find the right balance between music, comedy and drama.|$|E

500|$|... "I Found a Body" [...] {{features}} lyrics {{similar to}} the plot of Weekend at Bernie's, and incorporates Bruce's singing, concluding with a [...] "Pearl Jam style yell". [...] "Fonz Pond" [...] {{was inspired by a}} series of bicycle trails and paths leading to what had once been a pond, but had dried out, and was filled with garbage and rusted junk. Rumors spread <b>about</b> <b>kids</b> that died trying to pass the curve surrounding the area. Clark created a beat which sounded unlike what Bruce had initially expected, leading him to write a song about a haunted pond hidden in the woods. Bruce describes the production of [...] "Imma Kill U" [...] as similar to that of early albums by Ice Cube and Public Enemy. Bruce states that Utsler initially hated [...] "Juggalo Island" [...] when they began recording it, and said that it was [...] "too soft" [...] for Insane Clown Posse. Bruce maintained his confidence in the song, but promised Utsler that if he still felt the same way after the song was completed, it would be left off the album. As the recording continued, Utsler began to like the track more, and later praised the song in a phone conversation.|$|E
500|$|In May 2007 Time {{magazine}} ran {{an article}} by James Poniewozik titled [...] "Is Shrek Bad for Kids?" [...] which considered the negative effects on children of being raised with fairy tale satires, instead of the original stories. Poniewozik mentioned Hoodwinked! writing, [...] "I thought Hoodwinked! {{and most of the}} Shrek series were hilarious... But even if you ultimately reject their messages, old-school fairy tales are part of our cultural vocabulary. There's something a little sad <b>about</b> <b>kids</b> growing up in a culture where their fairy tales come pre-satirized, the skepticism, critique and revision having been done for them by the mama birds of Hollywood." [...] Cory Edwards wrote into the magazine, expressing his similar sentiments and writing, [...] "As the writer-director of Hoodwinked, it may surprise you that I couldn't agree more with James Poniewozik's article. Even as I was making the film, I asked myself the same question: Are we parodying something that kids should have the chance to experience first, 'un-parodied?' We {{went to great lengths to}} distance our film from Shreks humor (and no, I don't think Shrek considers kids). I would hope that Hoodwinked and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters, rather than look for the next joke at the expense of innocence. We ALL need the real folklore of fairytales, whether we admit it or not." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Mahoney and Winter {{began working}} on the film in 2006. Winter had watched a film called The Women's Story, about two Iraqi women who had journeyed {{around the country and}} filmed what they saw. They wanted to make a {{documentary}} about [...] "the people never seen on the evening news, [...] presidents, prime ministers, generals and militants ... claiming to know something of Iraq's future". Winter explained that [...] "all these documentaries coming out of Iraq were done for or by adults. Iraqi children had not been more than a UN statistic about the dead, kidnapped or injured", so they decided to concentrate on what they viewed as the [...] "real source of Iraq's future" [...] – teenagers. [...] "I wanted {{to tell the story of}} Iraq in a different way. As journalists, we do stories <b>about</b> <b>kids</b> and teenagers, but we don't hear from them. If you go to the UN reports, they are just a number and that's it." [...] O'Mahoney was a little more reticent; he had recently worked in Iraq but did not wish to return due to the civil war and the deteriorating condition of the country. When it was decided to use a school as a backdrop to the story, which could also be used to provide a chronological narrative, O'Mahoney and Winter realised it would be too dangerous for the students to be seen with either a Western or Iraqi camera crew because it would draw too much attention to them, and so they decided that the students would film the documentary themselves.|$|E

500|$|Votta {{criticized the}} show for the [...] "pointless adult love triangle" [...] {{involving}} Coach Beiste, Sue, and Cooter Menkins. VanDerWerff described Jones as [...] "one of the show's greatest gifts", and lamented that they had her [...] "fighting with Sue Dynasty-style over a recruiter for Ohio State". Bell called the scene where Beiste [...] "confesses her love for Cooter" [...] a [...] "simply sweet scene that's only ruined by Sue's grumpy presence", and Sue's decision to go after Cooter a [...] "crazy plot". Votta looked at Sue's pursuit of Cooter through a different lens: [...] "in an episode that should be <b>about</b> <b>kids</b> {{who are looking for}} approval and the various ways they do and don't achieve that", the show gives a [...] "completely opposite message from Sue's quest to prove her straightness", which [...] "muddles" [...] the show's messages. Chaney thought that Sue [...] "was back in fine, vindictive catchphrase-spewing form", and noted that [...] "all the election subplots were tied up remarkably quickly". This last point did not sit well with Berk, who wrote that the show resolved [...] "what was {{one of the more interesting}} subplots in one of the least interesting ways", and Canning was disappointed that the episode did not have [...] "more with Burt". As for Burt's son, Kurt, Votta wanted to [...] "leap through the television and explain to him that student council elections mean absolutely nothing" [...] to his future college prospects, and Kubicek declared himself [...] "sick" [...] of that plot thread, which he called [...] "just plain moronic".|$|E

Fedor explained that was difficult shot the video, and commented [...] "this video was my hey day.... my apex.... the day I went Erich von Stroheim." [...] The music video features the band members in a desert-mud based set where people are digging in mud pits. The band are playing in a ditch where others are watching them. Near the end of the video, {{what appears to be a}} SWAT team arrives and begins taking control of the area, hosing down the diggers.
