40|$|Abstract. The Acid Drainage Technology Initiative (ADTI) is a {{coalition}} {{of federal and state}} agencies, industry, academia, and consulting firms working together to promote communications and technology enhancement in the field of prediction and remediation of acid drainage from mining activities, past and present. This joint effort was formed in recognition of the need to address a range of issues dealing with the technical problems of predicting and controlling acid drainage. These include: the legacy of <b>acid</b> mine drainage/acid <b>rock</b> <b>drainage</b> (AMD/ARD) problems throughout the U. S; the development of consensus on improved test methods, particularly for prediction of mine drainage quality prior to mining; avoidance and remediation technology to prevent, treat and abate AMD/ARD pollution in an effective and economical manner and the application of “best science ” methods to accomplish these goals. ADTI is subdivided into a coal mining sector and a metal mining sector. The coal mining secto...|$|R
40|$|The past mining {{activity}} for kaolin minerals left several abandoned quarries {{in the area}} of Furtei (southern Sardinia). Recently, gold mineralization has been found in association with intensely altered andesitic rocks, and an open-pit gold mine is expected to open in the near future. Twenty-one water samples were analyzed {{for a wide range of}} major and trace elements, in order to define the present hydrochemical situation before exploitation starts. Waters interacting with the altered andesitic rocks had higher salinity and metal concentrations than waters in contact with nonaltered <b>rocks.</b> <b>Acid</b> <b>drainage</b> and high concentrations of metals (Al, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, As) in solution were observed in waters leaching the mineral deposit. An environmental impact study is urgently called for since the waste material derived from the exploitation is expected to enhance acidification and metal-releasing processes, due to the increase in the specific yield, which favors the oxidation of sufide minerals...|$|R
5|$|Natural {{decomposition}} of the shale into smaller fragments can affect slope stability, necessitating shallower slopes that require more material be disturbed in {{cut and fill}} work, exacerbating the <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drainage</b> problem. The cut material cannot be used as fill beneath roads and structures due to volumetric expansion, compounding the problem. The Tioga ash beds contain bentonite clay which presents a landslide hazard in the unexcavated rock as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drainage</b> occurs {{naturally}} within some environments {{as part of}} {{the rock}} weathering process but is exacerbated by large-scale earth disturbances characteristic of mining and other large construction activities, usually within rocks containing an abundance of sulfide minerals. Areas where the earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, and transportation corridors) may create <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drainage.</b> In many localities, the liquid that drains from coal stocks, coal handling facilities, coal washeries, and coal waste tips can be highly acidic, and in such cases it is treated as <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drainage.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drainage</b> has {{recently}} been a hindrance to {{the completion of the}} construction of Interstate 99 near State College, Pennsylvania. However, this <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drainage</b> didn't come from a mine; rather, it was produced by oxidation of pyrite-rich rock which was unearthed during a road cut and then used as filler material in the I-99 construction. A similar situation developed at the Halifax airport in Canada. It is from these and similar experiences that the term <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drainage</b> has emerged as being preferable to acid mine drainage, thereby emphasizing the general nature of the problem.|$|E
2500|$|The {{influence}} of <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> {{was evident in}} the sound of heavy metal in the 1970s. Iron Butterfly's [...] "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" [...] is sometimes described {{as an example of the}} transition between <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> and heavy metal or the turning point in which <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> became [...] "heavy metal". [...] "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" [...] serves a notable example of 1960s and early 1970s <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> or heavy psychedelia, and the band would continue to experiment with distorted, [...] "fuzzy", heavy psychedelia into the 1970s. Both Iron Butterfly's 1968 album In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida and Blue Cheer's 1968 album Vincebus Eruptum have been described as ainfluential in the transition of <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> into heavy metal. Heavy metal's <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> origins can further be seen in the loud <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> of groups such as Steppenwolf, who contributed their song [...] "Born to Be Wild" [...] to the soundtrack of the 1969 film Easy Rider, which itself glamorized the genre. Ultimately, Steppenwolf and other <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> groups such as Cream, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and Led Zeppelin paved the way for the electrified, bluesy sound of early heavy metal.|$|R
25|$|As the {{movement}} progressed {{into the late}} 1960s and 1970s, elements of <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> split into two directions, with hard rock and heavy metal {{on one side and}} progressive rock on the other. In the 1990s, the stoner metal genre combined <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> with other hard rock styles such as grunge, updating the heavy riffs and long jams found in <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> and psychedelic-influenced metal.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, bands such as Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath {{combined}} the loud, raw distortion of <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> with occult lyrics, further forming {{a basis for}} the genre now known as [...] "heavy metal". At a time when rock music began to turn back to roots-oriented soft <b>rock,</b> many <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> groups instead evolved into heavy metal bands. As its own movement, heavy metal music continued to perpetuate characteristics of <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> bands into at least the 1980s, and traces of psychedelic rock {{can be seen in the}} musical excesses of later metal bands. In the 1990s, the stoner metal genre combined <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> with other hard rock genres such as grunge, updating the heavy riffs and long jams found in the <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> and psychedelic-influenced metal of bands such as Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer, Hawkwind, and Blue Öyster Cult.|$|R
25|$|Acid mine {{drainage}}, {{acid and}} metalliferous drainage (AMD), or <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drainage</b> (ARD) is the outflow of acidic water from metal mines or coal mines.|$|E
25|$|Brine {{treatment}} is commonly encountered when treating cooling tower blowdown, produced water from steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), produced water from natural gas extraction such as coal seam gas, frac flowback water, acid mine or <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drainage,</b> reverse osmosis reject, chlor-alkali wastewater, {{pulp and paper}} mill effluent, and waste streams from food and beverage processing.|$|E
25|$|Public {{interest}} in the project has also resulted in outside, and opposing, interests publishing scientific reviews of available data and comparisons with other projects. These include reports or summaries on; seismic risks, <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drainage,</b> effects of roads and bridges on fish (roads supporting the Pebble mine could cross 20 known salmon streams), and general water pollution-related concerns.|$|E
30|$|To {{classify}} {{samples of}} the reservoir <b>rock,</b> <b>drainage</b> water–oil capillary pressure curves are usually used. Since {{the form of the}} capillary pressure curves may serve as an indication of basic parameters of a rock, such as rock permeability, homogeneity, pore radius, and rock wettability, this form can describe <b>rock</b> <b>drainage</b> under the governing mechanism. It can be generally assumed that rocks of similar capillary pressure curves exhibit the same behavior in terms of fluid flow. Therefore, to determine different types of reservoir rocks, one can draw all of the water–oil capillary pressure curves on the same plot and classify similar curves under the same class. Figure  3 presents the separation of capillary pressure curves for different rock types.|$|R
2500|$|Heavy metal {{evolved from}} {{psychedelic}} music and added psychedelic/acid rock {{to the basic}} structure of blues rock. In the 1960s, the heavy, blues-influenced, psychedelic hard rock sound of bands such as the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Deep Purple, and Cream was classified as <b>acid</b> <b>rock.</b> Other <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> groups such as Blue Cheer, Iron Butterfly, and Vanilla Fudge served as examples of early heavy metal, or proto-metal, creating stripped-downed, loud, intense, and [...] "fuzzy" [...] <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> or hard rock. Bands such as Blue Cheer, Cream, and the hard rock group The Amboy Dukes have all been described as [...] "leading practitioners" [...] of the harder variant of psychedelic rock known as [...] "acid rock". Many <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> bands would subsequently become heavy metal bands.|$|R
2500|$|Other bands {{credited}} with creating or laying {{the foundation for}} <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> include garage rock bands such as the 13th Floor Elevators and Count Five. The blues rock group the Paul Butterfield Blues Band are also {{credited with}} spawning the harder <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> sound, and their 1966 instrumental [...] "East-West", with its early use of the extended rock solo, {{has been described as}} laying [...] "the roots of psychedelic acid rock" [...] and featuring [...] "much of acid-rock's eventual DNA". Author Steve Turner recognises the Beatles' success in conveying an LSD-inspired worldview on their 1966 album Revolver, especially with the track [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows", as having [...] "opened the doors" [...] to <b>acid</b> <b>rock.</b> The Beatles' June 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was a major influence on American <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> groups.|$|R
25|$|Sub-surface mining often {{progresses}} {{below the}} water table, so water must be constantly pumped {{out of the}} mine {{in order to prevent}} flooding. When a mine is abandoned, the pumping ceases, and water floods the mine. This introduction of water is the initial step in most <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drainage</b> situations. Tailings piles or ponds, mine waste rock dumps, and coal spoils are also an important source of acid mine drainage.|$|E
25|$|Oyu Tolgoi mine {{is located}} {{in one of the}} driest areas in Mongolia. Rainfall in the desert area ranges between zero and 50mm per year. It is {{estimated}} that the water demand will triple in the coming two decades mainly due to mineral exploitation in the area. Herders worry that Oyu Tolgoi is draining the region’s water supply, since it uses more than a billion gallons of water a month. In addition, there is a substantial risk of <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drainage</b> from the mine, from tailings storage facilities and from any overburden or waste rock stored on the surface and not deposited back into the mine.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, the acidic {{discharges}} {{from active}} or abandoned mines were called acid mine drainage, or AMD. The term <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drainage,</b> or ARD, {{was introduced in}} the 1980s and 1990s to indicate that acidic drainage can originate from sources other than mines. For example, a paper presented in 1991 at a major international conference on this subject was titled: [...] "The Prediction of <b>Acid</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>Drainage</b> - Lessons from the Database" [...] Both AMD and ARD refer to low pH or acidic waters caused by the oxidation of sulfide minerals, though ARD is the more generic name.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "psychedelic" [...] {{was first}} coined in 1956 by {{psychiatrist}} Humphry Osmond {{as an alternative}} descriptor for hallucinogenic drugs {{in the context of}} psychedelic psychotherapy. As the countercultural scene developed in San Francisco, the terms <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> and psychedelic rock were used in 1966 to describe the new drug-influenced music and were being widely used by 1967. The terms psychedelic <b>rock</b> and <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> are often used interchangeably, but <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> may be distinguished as a more extreme variation that was heavier, louder, relied on long jams, focused more directly on LSD, and made greater use of distortion.|$|R

2500|$|Sulfuric acid {{is formed}} {{naturally}} by the oxidation of sulfide minerals, such as iron sulfide.

2500|$|According to Laura Diane Kuhn, {{the heavier}} form of {{psychedelic}} <b>rock</b> known as <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> {{developed from the}} late 1960s California music scene. Former Atlantic Records executive Phillip Rauls recalls: [...] "I was {{in the music business}} at the time, and my very first recognition of <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> ... was, of all people, the Beach Boys and the song 'Good Vibrations'. ... That [...] sent so many musicians back to the studio to create this music on acid." [...] The Charlatans were among the first Bay Area <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> bands, though Jefferson Airplane was the first Bay Area <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> band to sign a major label and achieve mainstream success. By July 1967, Time magazine wrote, [...] "From jukeboxes and transistors across the nation pulses the turned-on sound of acid-rock groups: the Jefferson Airplane, the Doors, Moby Grape". In 1968, Life magazine referred to the Doors as the [...] "kings of acid rock".|$|R

50|$|Another {{reason that}} the Charlatans' {{extended}} stay at the Red Dog Saloon was important was that, immediately before their first performance at the club, the band members took LSD.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} known use of {{the term}} [...] "garage punk" [...] appeared in Lenny Kaye's track-by-track liner notes for the 1972 anthology compilation , which prominently featured both <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> and garage rock.

This <b>acid</b> <b>rock</b> present in the Nuggets anthology has been described as an offshoot of 1960s punk rock.
