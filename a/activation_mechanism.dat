2500|$|The {{initiation}} of apoptosis is tightly regulated by <b>activation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> because once apoptosis has begun, it inevitably {{leads to the}} death of the cell. [...] The two best-understood <b>activation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are the intrinsic pathway (also called the mitochondrial pathway) and the extrinsic pathway. The intrinsic pathway is activated by intracellular signals generated when cells are stressed and depends on the release of proteins from the intermembrane space of mitochondria. The extrinsic pathway is activated by extracellular ligands binding to cell-surface death receptors, which leads to the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC).|$|R
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, MAPKs typically form multi-tiered pathways, receiving input {{several levels}} above the actual MAP kinase. In {{contrast to the}} relatively simple, phosphorylation-dependent <b>activation</b> <b>mechanism</b> of MAPKs and MAP2Ks, MAP3Ks have stunningly complex regulation. Many of the better-known MAP3Ks, such as c-Raf, MEKK4 or MLK3 require multiple steps for their activation. These are typically allosterically-controlled enzymes, tighly locked into an inactive state by multiple mechanisms. The first step en route to their activation consist of relieving their autoinhibition by a smaller ligand (such as Ras for c-Raf, GADD45 for MEKK4 or Cdc42 for MLK3). This commonly (but not always) happens at the cell membrane, where most of their activators are bound (note that small G-proteins are constitutively membrane-associated due to prenylation). That step is followed by side-to-side homo- and heterodimerisation of their now accessible kinase domains. Recently determined complex structures reveal that the dimers are formed in an orientation that leaves both their substrate-binding regions free. Importantly, this dimerisation event also forces the MAP3 kinase domains to adopt a partially active conformation. Full activity is only achieved once these dimers transphosphorylate each other on their activation loops. The latter step can also be achieved or aided by auxiliary protein kinases (MAP4 kinases, members of the Ste20 family). Once a MAP3 kinase is fully active, it may phosphorylate its substrate MAP2 kinases, which in turn will phosphorylate their MAP kinase substrates.|$|E

40|$|To balance {{self-tolerance}} and immunity against pathogens or tumours, {{the immune}} system depends on both <b>activation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and down-regulatory mechanisms. Immunologists have long been focusing on <b>activation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and a major breakthrough was {{the identification of the}} Toll-like receptor (TLR) family of proteins. TLRs recognize conserved molecular patterns present on pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. Pathogen recognition via TLRs activates the innate as well as the adaptive immune response. The discovery of a suppressive T-cell subset that constitutively expresses the interleukin (IL) - 2 receptor alpha-chain (CD 25) has boosted efforts to investigate the negative regulation of immune responses. It is now well appreciated that these regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a pivotal role in controlling immune function. Interestingly, recent studies revealed that TLR 2 signalling affects Treg expansion and function. This review will focus on the presence and influence of different TLRs on T lymphocytes, including Tregs, and their role in cancer...|$|R

Upon binding of TCPOBOP, CAR gets dephosphorylated by PP2A and translocates into the nucleus. Here, it forms a complex with RXR and binds to the PB-responsive enhancer module.

RACK-1 then stimulates PP2A to dephosphorylate CAR, which is then translocated into the nucleus.|$|R
