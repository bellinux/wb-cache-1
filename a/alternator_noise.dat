The investigation begins with a study into the contribution of the alternator to the noise inside the vehicle. This is followed by the description of an experiment to determine subjectively threshold levels for alternator tonal noise. From the results of these tests <b>alternator</b> <b>noise</b> target levels are derived. Finally, the derived alternator target noise levels are compared with current alternator performance...|$|E

40|$|A {{modeling}} method of electric power network inside {{a fishing boat}} less than 5 tons is proposed for its high-energy efficiency with renewable energy sources. The power network inside the fishing boat consists of a diesel engine, a starter motor, an alternator, battery packs, and electric loads, which are connected in parallel. To obtain proper power network model, the voltage&# 8211;current characteristics of the electric components are considered to develop elaborate electrical models under several load conditions. Measured data of the battery and <b>alternator</b> current include <b>noise.</b> By using an average method, the AC components from the power network of the fishing boat can be reduced, which is verified by KCL rule. Using the proposed power network model, the power generation of the alternator and the reduction of diesel consumption in the boatâ€™s engine are predictable under various operating conditions. The validity of the proposed methodology is verified by comparing simulation results with experimental measurements using statistical inferences. clos...|$|R
