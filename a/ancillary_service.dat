40|$|Artículos en revistasUnder a {{deregulated}} environment, <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> (AS) {{are defined}} as the set of products separated from the energy production, which are related to security and reliability of a power system. <b>Ancillary</b> <b>services</b> can be classified in: (a) active power <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> (load&# 8211;frequency control (LFC) &# 8212;including primary control, automatic generation control (AGC), tertiary control, balancing service and black start provision) and (b) reactive power <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> (voltage control). The system operator is the entity responsible for the secure operation of the power system and in this way, the management of all the AS is considered a specific function of the system operator. Under a deregulated framework, <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> are separated from the energy production, and can be mandatory or remunerated under market-driven mechanisms. This paper overviews the management of <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> in the Spanish power system, including a detailed technical description of the services {{and the organization of}} the <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> markets.

50|$|<b>Ancillary</b> <b>services</b> are the {{specialty}} services and functions {{provided by the}} electric grid that facilitate and support the continuous flow of electricity so that supply will continually meet demand. The term <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> is {{used to refer to}} a variety of operations beyond generation and transmission that are required to maintain grid stability and security. These services generally include, frequency control, spinning reserves and operating reserves. Traditionally <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> have been provided by generators, however, the integration of intermittent generation and the development of smart grid technologies have prompted a shift in the equipment {{that can be used to}} provide <b>ancillary</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R

40|$|All {{users of}} an {{electrical}} power system expect that the frequency and voltages are maintained within acceptable boundaries at all times. Some participants, mainly generating units, provide the necessary frequency and voltage control <b>services,</b> called <b>ancillary</b> <b>services.</b> Since these participants are entitled to receive a payment for the services provided, markets for <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> have been developed along with the liberalisation of electricity markets. However, current arrangements vary widely from a power system to another. This thesis provides a comprehensive assessment of markets for frequency and voltage control <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> along three axes: (a) defining the needs for frequency and voltages, as well as specifying the <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> that can fulfil these needs; (b) assessing the cost of <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> for a producer; and (c) discussing the market design of an efficient procurement of <b>ancillary</b> <b>services.</b> Such a comprehensive assessment exhibits several advantages: (a) stakeholders can quickly grasp the issues related to ancillary services; (b) participants benefit from a standardised method to assess their system; (c) solutions are proposed to improve current arrangements; and (d) theoretical limitations that need future work are identified...|$|R

The result: {{the addition of the}} new front lobby, patient rooms and <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> areas, parking garage and other areas. In 1984, a corporate restructuring created a family of corporations united by a single goal: doing whatever was necessary to maintain Home Hospital as a vibrant, community-owned hospital. North Central Health Services (NCHS) became the new name and parent company of Home Hospital and several other ventures. In 1990, in preparing for its 100th anniversary as Home Hospital, it launched a massive remodeling and modernization project. On Sept. 26, 1997, Home Hospital and St. Elizabeth officials announced that the two entities intended to combine the governance and management in a new corporation. The unified hospital system - originally called Greater Lafayette Health Services GLHS - would work to be more efficient and more responsive to those who purchase and consume health care. Some of the benefits of creating the new system would be to eliminate waste and reduce the duplication of expensive technology. They officially merged on Jan. 1, 1999.|$|E
