40|$|This paper uses {{a dynamic}} general {{equilibrium}} model with money to investigate theoretically under what conditions deflation impinges on <b>a</b> <b>government's</b> fiscal standing. Focus is placed on an upper bound that is compatible with a no Ponzie game condition for the <b>government</b> and <b>an</b> equilibrium. A comparative dynamics analysis demonstrates that if <b>a</b> <b>government's</b> fiscal deficit is not so high, deflation has {{a negative impact on}} the upper bound, while if <b>a</b> <b>government's</b> fiscal deficit exceeds a critical level, deflation rather improves it. The critical level depends on a time stream of disposable real incomes and a preference parameter. Copyright 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation 2009 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd...|$|R
