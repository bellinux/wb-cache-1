There, he is still unable to <b>access</b> <b>the</b> COS, but discovers that it has learned to talk. Lamana arrives, but is killed when the COS causes his elevator to crash.|$|E
5|$|A study, using stuffed bird models, {{found that}} small birds {{are less likely}} to {{approach}} common cuckoos (a brood parasite) which have barred underparts like the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Eurasian reed warblers were found to be more aggressive to cuckoos which looked less hawk-like, meaning that the resemblance to the hawk helps the cuckoo to <b>access</b> <b>the</b> nests of potential hosts.|$|E

5|$|Helicases are {{proteins}} {{that are a}} type of molecular motor.

5000|$|... ==Chained {{directory}} format== In {{this format}} the memory holds the directory pointer {{to the latest}} cache that <b>accessed</b> <b>the</b> block and each cache has the pointer to the previous cache that <b>accessed</b> <b>the</b> block. So when a processor sends a write request to a block in memory, the processor sends invalidations down the chain of pointers. In this directory when a cache block is replaced we need to traverse the list in order to change the directory which increases latency. In order to prevent this doubly linked lists are widely used now in which each cached copy has pointers to previous and the next cache that <b>accesses</b> <b>the</b> block.|$|R
