25|$|Frankie Laine was {{somebody}} that everybody knew.

You could hear two notes and you knew who it was and you were right on the beam with it right away. And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability. — John Williams.|$|E
25|$|Short path {{distillation}} is a distillation {{technique that}} involves the distillate travelling a short distance, often only a few centimeters, and is normally done at reduced pressure. A classic example would be a distillation involving the distillate travelling from one glass bulb to another, {{without the need for}} a condenser separating the two chambers. This technique is often used for compounds which are unstable at high temperatures or to purify small amounts of compound. The advantage is that the heating temperature can be considerably lower (at reduced pressure) than the boiling point of the liquid at standard pressure, and the distillate only has to travel a short distance before condensing. A short path ensures that little compound is lost {{on the sides of the}} apparatus. The Kugelrohr is <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> short path distillation apparatus which often contain multiple chambers to collect distillate fractions.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese Royal Court and Government install {{themselves}} in Brazil from 1808, with Rio de Janeiro becoming {{the de facto}} capital of the Portuguese Empire. In 1815, Brazil is raised {{to the status of}} Kingdom, with the whole Portuguese Monarchy becoming the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. As a retaliation against the Napoleonic invasion of the Portugal, the Portuguese forces in Brazil invade and conquer the French Guiana in 1808. In 1811, the Portuguese Army in Brazil invades the Banda Oriental (present day Uruguay), to retake Portuguese claimed territories that were under Spanish occupation. In 1816, the Portuguese Forces invade again the Banda Oriental, defeating the forces of Artigas in a series of battles. Banda Oriental is then annexed to the Portuguese Crown as the Brazilian Cisplatine Province. After the declaration of the Independence of Brazil in September 1822, by the Portuguese Prince heir Peter, the Portuguese Army fought the brief Brazilian War of Independence. This war assumed a character of <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> civil war, with the forces loyal to the Portuguese Government fighting the separatist army whose leaders and officers were also mostly Portuguese. By 1823, the resistance of the Portuguese loyal forces was concentrated in some coastal cities, especially those of Salvador of Bahia and Montevideo (presently the capital of Uruguay), all under siege of the Brazilian separatist forces. Despite repelling successive attacks by the superior Brazilian forces, but with no perspectives of receiving reinforcements, the Portuguese garrison of Salvador, under the command of General Madeira de Melo, evacuated the city and embarked in a Portuguese naval squadron, sailing to Portugal in July 1823. The Portuguese garrison of Montevideo was the last to resist in Brazil, only surrendering to the Brazilian forces (ironically, commanded by the Portuguese General Carlos Lecor) on the 8 March 1824.|$|E

Some count him <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ignorant and blind God, that can neither know nor see through the clouds (Job 22:13). Some again count him an inconsiderable God, not worth the enjoying, if it must not be but {{with the loss of}} this world, and their lusts (Job 21:9-15). Moreover, some think him to be altogether such an one as themselves, one that hath as little hatred to sin as themselves, and as little love to holiness as themselves (Psa 50:21).|$|R

At some point between 10:45–11:00 Saari ran down a corridor and threw a petrol bomb into a language laboratory. He then shot out all of the windows in the school's main corridor, that extended through the building. It was during this time that he also took aim at Forsberg.|$|E

American music critic Ann Powers explained that what Madonna searched for with Orbit [...] "was <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lushness that she wanted for this record. Techno and rave was happening in the 90s and had a lot of different forms. There was very experimental, more hard stuff like Aphex Twin. There was party stuff like Fatboy Slim. That's not what Madonna wanted for this. She wanted something more like a singer-songwriter, really. And William Orbit provided her with that." ...|$|E
