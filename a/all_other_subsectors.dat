30|$|Economic {{theories}} {{explain the}} economic growth affected by accumulation of production factors and increase in productivity and efficiency. Traditional growth theories focus on the first factor where in developing countries, and especially due to the low input of capital, serious problems arise in the growth process. Accordingly, in these countries, increase in the productivity and efficiency {{and use of the}} excess capacity has focused. Therefore, the efficiency analysis of economic sectors of these countries, and especially the manufacturing sector and the factors that affect it, is very important to study. The main purpose of this study with respect to the indicators of efficiency of firms operating in Turkey manufacturing industry is to analyze the impact of scale differences on firm performance. The database used in this study is provided from the survey results (2006) belongs to Istanbul OSB, from the balance sheets and income statements of firms registered in IMKB, which operate in Turkey manufacturing industry for the 2006. Furthermore, the database for descriptive analyses was obtained from Statistics Department of Turkey (TUIK) and Turkey’s Development Bank. As the analyzing method, the stochastic frontier is used as well as the metafrontier. According to the frontier function scores in the subsectors, in small-scale firms MP, FDT and MEMSAS subsectors and in medium- and large-scale firms OCP, FDT and TSL subsectors are the most efficient subsectors. Also, according to the metafrontier function scores in the subsectors, in small-scale firms MP, MMR and OCP subsectors and in medium- and large-scale firms MP, TSL and OCP subsectors are the most efficient subsectors. Some of {{the results of this study}} reveal that, except of food stuffs and drinks (FDT) oil, chemistry, petrochemical and its derivatives (OCP) subsectors, the production inefficiency which occurs in other subsectors due to conditions of increasing return to scale is significantly caused by the operation carried out below the optimal production scale. In addition, except BMI subsector, in <b>all</b> <b>other</b> <b>subsectors,</b> it is seen that production scale has large impact on the efficiency of the firm and also the average efficiency of medium- and large-scale firms in each subsector is higher than the average efficiency of small-scale firms of same subsector.|$|E

World acclaimed American psychologist, Abraham Maslow ranked shelter as second only to food in his hierarchy of human needs. Despite the importance of housing to the socio-economic development of man and the nation, housing problems have remained endemic throughout the world. In today’s world, some 100 million persons are homeless {{and more than a}} billion are inadequately housed. In 2002 housing deficit in Nigeria was put at about 8 million units. Latest statistics indicate that Nigeria requires a whopping 700, 000 housing units annually for the next 15 years. The question is why this state of affairs? Why the perennial and unending problems of housing shortages, forced evictions and slum development? The paper examined these issues in Nigeria in order to advance the future prospect of the sector.

40|$|We {{decompose}} {{factors affecting}} China’s energy-related air pollutant (NOx, PM 2. 5, and SO 2) emission changes into different effects using structural decomposition analysis (SDA). We find that, from 2005 to 2012, investment increased NOx, PM 2. 5, and SO 2 emissions by 14. 04, 7. 82 and 15. 59 Mt respectively, and consumption increased these emissions by 11. 09, 7. 98, and 12. 09 Mt respectively. Export and import slightly increased the emissions on the whole, but {{the rate of}} the increase has slowed down, possibly reflecting the shift in China’s foreign trade structure. Energy intensity largely reduced NOx, PM 2. 5, and SO 2 emissions by 12. 49, 14. 33 and 23. 06 Mt respectively, followed by emission efficiency that reduces these emissions by 4. 57, 9. 08, and 17. 25 Mt respectively. Input-output efficiency slightly reduces the emissions. At sectoral and sub-sectoral levels, consumption is a great driving factor in agriculture and commerce, whereas investment is a great driving factor in transport, construction, and some industrial subsectors such as iron and steel, nonferrous metals, building materials, coking, and power and heating supply.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 The {{performance}} of the meat products industry, the largest food processing sector in the U. S. in terms of shipment value, is an important issue. A key indicator of its performance is productivity growth, which results in reduction {{in the cost of}} production at given input prices. The present study employs a general econometric model to analyze the technology structure and productivity change in the U. S. meat products industry at the SIC 4 -digit level, allowing for short-run fixity of capital and non-competitive behavior in the output market. Empirical results suggest that the rate of productivity growth, both in the short run and in the long run, exhibited a generally declining trend over the study period. Specifically, from 1973 to 1994, the absolute value of the short-run dual rate of productivity growth dropped from 0. 791 % to 0. 278 %, 1. 114 % to 0. 506 %, 0. 982 % to 0. 491 %, and 1. 117 % to 0. 560 % in SIC 2011, SIC 2013, SIC 2016, and SIC 2017, respectively. Similarly, from 1973 to 1994, these four subsectors experienced a decrease in the absolute value of the long-run dual rate of productivity growth from 0. 920 % to 0. 193 %, 1. 226 % to 0. 409 %, 1. 201 % to 0. 411 %, and 1. 3 13 % to 0. 55 1 %, respectively. In all four subsectors. the short-run technological change has been labor-saving and material-using.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the risk-adjusted {{performance of the}} utilities industry in both the United States and Canada from 1970 to 2001 using five measures of risk-adjusted performance. Risk-adjusted performance is analyzed using the Sharpe ratio, the Jensen Alpha, the M 2, the Fama-French three-factor model, and a conditional CAPM model adjusted on market movements. We analyze the effect of deregulation on the industry and test whether the geographic location or the SIC classification are indicative of superior performance. We also analyze the volatility of the market, subsectors, and firms within the utilities industry to determine the volatility patterns of stock returns in the industry. The utilities industry in both the US and Canada have outperformed their respective markets on a risk-adjusted basis for the full period. Deregulation had {{a positive effect on}} the performance of US utilities, however, deregulation did not affect the performance of Canadian utilities. Geographic location does not provide an indication of superior performance within the US utilities industry, however, according to the SIC classification, gas companies clearly outperform <b>other</b> <b>subsectors</b> in the industry whereas water companies have the lowest performance. In the Canadian market, eastern companies have the highest performance, followed by western companies, then the central companies. According to the SIC classification, the Canadian electricity subsector shows signs of higher performance relative to the gas <b>subsector</b> and the <b>other</b> <b>subsectors</b> of the industry. Volatility analysis shows no trend in the volatility of the US and Canadian markets.

Considering the analytic results of this research, except for the subsector of food stuff (FDT) and oil and oil derivatives (OCP), generally in <b>other</b> <b>subsectors</b> there is increasing return to scale and the inefficient production existence in this condition seriously originates from doing producing activities under the optimal production scale. These results, from the viewpoint of Turkey’s manufacturing industries, require doing the efficient sector analysis in these industries. Also, it reveals the necessity of taking more efficient policies in this industry. In other words, every active manufacturing firm in each subsector, especially the directors of manufacturing firms with medium scale and large scale, should determine its own competitive scale inside the subsector in the best possible way. In summary, through the discussion on the dynamism of competition power, the main origin of the inefficiency in the local and international markets can be recognized and the situations of doing the more dynamic analysis can be provided.|$|R

40|$|The {{disruption}} of any critical infrastructural sector {{has the potential}} to create significant direct consequences and cross-sectoral effects {{in a short period of}} time. In this article, we suggest a consequence-, time- and interdependency-based risk assessment approach that seeks to identify which direct consequences and intersectoral effects are likely to emerge in what time frame. We argue that critical infrastructures with the capacity to cause the greatest societal consequences and strongest intersectoral negative effects in the shortest time represent the most risky infrastructures. Such a direct risk assessment was further improved by a network-based risk calculation that takes not only first-order effects into account, but also then-order intersectoral cascading effects. Applying this model to 17 infrastructural subsectors in Slovenia shows that the network transfer of effects among critical infrastructures can considerably and unpredictably change their initially calculated risk. The riskiest subsectors at the maximal level of network effects turned out to be those on which <b>other</b> <b>subsectors</b> heavily directly and indirectly depend: electricity, ICT, road transport and financial instruments.

However, efforts to deepen manufacturing development have not succeeded in nurturing {{a critical mass of}} domestic entrepreneurs with indigenous innovative capacities as industrialization continues to be dependent on imported technology and capital. Instead, the manufacturing sector is facing premature deindustrialization. In view of these developments, this study aims to assess the extent of industrial deepening in a country through the development of linkages, as well as the key factors that have contributed to this. This has important policy lessons for other developing countries that are following similar export-oriented, foreign direct investment-led strategies for their industrial development.

The results of hypothesis testing in each subsector reveals that for small firms the Cobb–Douglas function and for medium and large firms Translog function have more consistency and compatibility with studied and reviewed data. To compensate for this difference in choosing appropriate function form for the all groups of the subsectors, estimators have been obtained by using the both functions form. Considering the results of the estimation of the both function forms and referring to Coelli et al.’s (1998) Parsimory concept, and also because of necessity of same function form use in estimating all functions of each group in each subsector in metafrontier (envelop) function estimation, the most stable function and the most reliable estimators have been considered as analysis parameters and the corresponding form with that estimators has been considered as an acceptable form for that subsector.|$|R

40|$|Concerns about {{production}} efficiency, quality, and affordability in {{the residential}} construction indicate there may be benefits in adopting alternative production control strategies to those traditionally used. Reducing adverse effects of exogenous variability in demand and endogenous variability in process are the ultimate goals of production control strategies. For residential construction this means controlling the number of houses under construction and controlling the start rate of new house constructions. The aim of this investigation is to compare and contrast the outcomes of these two production management strategies. Production data of two volume house builders in Victoria and Queensland, Australia, were collected. Tangible performance metrics from the builders were analyzed and compared using the principles of queuing theory. Then numerous simulation experiments were designed and run to analyze different what-if scenarios in the building environment. A special purpose simulation template was developed to define a cap for production and {{limit the number of}} houses under construction based on actual demand and available capacity. The findings reveal that rate-driven construction outperforms due date-driven construction in terms of three studied performance measures. This investigation adopts an original and quantitative approach towards three production aspects of efficiency, supervision and controllability. Therefore it contributes to the body of knowledge by developing an in-depth insight into superior performance of the rate-driven control strategy with the intention of improving production output and long term sustainability of residential and <b>other</b> <b>subsectors</b> of the construction industry...|$|R
