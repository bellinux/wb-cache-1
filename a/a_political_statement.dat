5|$|On 21 June 1985, the 737-200 LN-SUG Harald Gille, with 121 {{passengers}} {{en route}} from Trondheim to Oslo, was hijacked by the 24-year-old Stein Arvid Huseby. He had threatened a flight attendant with an air gun. He demanded to talk to Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke and {{a press conference to}} make <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement.</b> His demands were not met, and he surrendered while the plane was parked in Oslo. This was the first hijacking in Norway.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} attack, {{hundreds}} of policemen and army forces personnel and two {{armored personnel carriers}} were brought into Yerevan, positioned on Baghramyan Avenue surrounding the National Assembly building. An anti-terrorist squad from Russia also participated in the operation. Meanwhile, ambulance vehicles rushed {{to the site of}} the shooting. President Robert Kocharyan was directing the operation of the security forces around the parliament building. While holding around 50 hostages inside the building, the men demanded a helicopter and airtime on national television for <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E
5|$|Armed {{with an air}} gun, Huseby {{threatened}} a cabin attendant and told the captain to proceed as planned to Fornebu. He claimed (falsely) to have placed explosives on board. His demands were to make <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement</b> and talk to Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke. The plane landed at 15:30 at Fornebu and was surrounded by the police. After one hour, Huseby released 70 hostages in exchange for having the aircraft being {{moved closer to the}} terminal building. Thirty minutes later, Huseby released the remaining passengers. He drank throughout the incident, and at 17:30, after he consumed the plane's beer supply, he surrendered his weapon in exchange for more beer. The plane was immediately stormed and Huseby arrested.|$|E
5000|$|The Pulpit Law (German Kanzelparagraph) was {{a section}} (§ 130a) to the Strafgesetzbuch (the German Criminal Code) {{passed by the}} Reichstag in 1871 during the German Kulturkampf or fight against the Catholic Church. It made it a crime for any cleric in public to make <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statements</b> that the {{government}} thought would [...] "endanger the public peace." [...] It applied to all of Germany. There were no jury trials in Germany, so the government could act aggressively. The law reads: ...|$|R

50|$|The Soria Moria {{declaration}} is <b>a</b> Norwegian <b>political</b> <b>statement</b> {{forming the}} basis of Jens Stoltenberg's second and first government. The statement outlines the focus and priority of the so-called Red-Green Coalition government of Labour Party, the Centre Party and Socialist Left Party.|$|R
5|$|In 2008, Triumph International {{came under}} fire after a female {{president}} of a local union was dismissed in Thailand. She had appeared on a Thai evening television program with a T-shirt on which <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement</b> could be seen. The company's management had {{the view that the}} appearance had harmed their public image and therefore laid off the staff member in question. The international work council of the company, Triumph International Labor Union, protested and collected 2,500 signatures to petition for the rehiring of the union president, supported in solidarity in Germany, inter alia, by the ver.di youth. In November 2008, the Labor Court in Bangkok found the lay-off to have been lawful.|$|E
5|$|A general {{perception}} on Narayan {{was that}} he did not involve himself or his writings with the politics or problems of India, as mentioned by V. S. Naipaul in one of his columns. However, according to Wyatt Mason of The New Yorker, although Narayan's writings seem simple and display a lack of interest in politics, he delivers his narrative with an artful and deceptive technique when dealing with such subjects and does not entirely avoid them, rather letting the words play in the reader's mind. Srinivasa Iyengar, former vice-chancellor of Andhra University, says that Narayan wrote about political topics only in the context of his subjects, quite unlike his compatriot Mulk Raj Anand who dealt with the political structures and problems of the time. Paul Brians, in his book Modern South Asian Literature in English, says that the fact that Narayan completely ignored British rule and focused on the private lives of his characters is <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement</b> on its own, declaring his independence from the influence of colonialism.|$|E
5|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that the Canadian Lady Corset Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern marketing strategies to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their bras. Rather, they saw bras {{as a means to}} feel and look beautiful, to be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While women sometimes went braless, they were making a fashion choice and not <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement.</b> Canadian Lady's management knew that girdles were out, but bras would remain an essential part of women's wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.|$|E
2500|$|In early June {{talks to}} build a {{national}} unity government to address the economic crisis collapsed, and Yulia Tymoshenko accused Yanukovych of betrayal: [...] "He unilaterally, without warning anyone, quit the negotiation process, making <b>a</b> loud <b>political</b> <b>statement,</b> killing the merger and the chances for Ukraine".|$|R
5|$|Tippett {{maintained}} his pacifist beliefs, while becoming generally less public in expressing them, and from 1959 {{served as president}} of the Peace Pledge Union. In 1977 he made <b>a</b> rare <b>political</b> <b>statement</b> when, opening <b>a</b> PPU exhibition at St Martin-in-the-Fields, he attacked President Carter's plans to develop a neutron bomb.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{introduced}} Kevin Cronin as vocalist {{and contributing}} songwriter to the band, replacing Terry Luttrell. Highlights {{of the album}} include Richrath’s “Golden Country”, <b>a</b> compelling <b>political</b> <b>statement</b> as well as [...] "Like You Do". Both songs, as well as Cronin’s “Music Man”, are frequently part of the band's current setlist.|$|R
25|$|The 1860 Halfpenny token, {{which is}} scarce has the date 1860 in {{the centre of}} the obverse inside a circle. The {{inscription}} FISHERY RIGHTS FOR NEWFOUNDLAND is enclosed outside the inner circle. The reverse of this piece is inscribed RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT going around the outside and AND FREE TRADE is in {{the centre of the}} reverse. This piece makes <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement</b> on promoting the fishing industry and asserting a claim to responsible government.|$|E
25|$|Lucheni was {{declared}} to be sane, but was tried {{as a common}} murderer, not a political criminal. Incarcerated for life, and denied {{the opportunity to make}} <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement</b> by his action, he attempted to kill himself with the sharpened key from a tin of sardines on 20 February 1900. Ten years later, he hanged himself with his belt in his cell on the evening of 16 October 1910, after a guard confiscated and destroyed his uncompleted memoirs.|$|E
25|$|Fasting {{is often}} used {{as a tool to}} make <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement,</b> to protest, or to bring {{awareness}} to a cause. A hunger strike is a method of non-violent resistance in which participants fast as an act of political protest, or to provoke feelings of guilt, or to achieve a goal such as a policy change. A spiritual fast incorporates personal spiritual beliefs with the desire to express personal principles, sometimes {{in the context of a}} social injustice.|$|E
500|$|... "This {{is not a}} {{question}} of theology", the ruling reads in part. [...] "The FSM Gospel is plainly a work of satire, meant to entertain while making <b>a</b> pointed <b>political</b> <b>statement.</b> To read it as religious doctrine would be little different from grounding a 'religious exercise' on any other work of fiction." ...|$|R

25|$|Exhibitionist {{displays}} {{are another}} manifestation of public bondage. They are typically undertaken {{by individuals who}} fetishize public displays of sex and sexuality. However, some exhibitionist bondage is done as <b>a</b> social or <b>political</b> <b>statement.</b> This could be an effort {{to raise awareness of}} alternative sexuality or <b>a</b> <b>political</b> metaphor for oppression.|$|R
25|$|On 21 June 1985, the 737-200 LN-SUG Harald Gille Flight 139, with 121 {{passengers}} {{en route}} from Trondheim to Oslo, was hijacked by the 24-year-old Stein Arvid Huseby. He had threatened a flight attendant with an air gun. He demanded to talk to Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke and {{a press conference to}} make <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement.</b> Those demands were not met, and he surrendered after 4.5 hours after he demanded and got a few beers. This was the first hijacking in Norway.|$|E
25|$|Kabakov {{claims the}} albums are a genre somewhere between {{several types of}} art {{including}} literature, fine arts, and cinematography. “Most of all,” he suggests, “the ‘albums’ are a type of ‘domestic theater’…like old theater conducted on a town square in broad daylight”. He compares his albums to theater where the viewer is bound by action and darkness, which {{does not allow for}} examination and evaluation of the action. The interest in giving the viewer the freedom to interact and interpret the artwork is central to Kabakov’s oeuvre. None of his works are didactic or attempt to deliver <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{two cases}} Filbinger saved {{opponents of the}} regime from execution: He {{interfered}} in the confirmation process of the case of military chaplain Möbius, who had been sentenced to death for <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement.</b> The case was reopened in spring 1945 and Möbius subsequently acquitted. As prosecutor in the case against Lieutenant Forstmeier, who had made some remarks about the July 20 Plot, he influenced the witnesses to testimonies, that could be interpreted in the defendant's favour, prolonged the proceedings and obtained a verdict of demotion and imprisonment on parole. Forstmeier {{was supposed to be}} sent to frontline combat, but {{the end of the war}} prevented this.|$|E
50|$|Justice Clarence Thomas concurred {{with the}} Court’s ruling on the Establishment Clause, but {{felt that the}} Klan’s primary goal with the cross did not {{exclusively}} serve a religious purpose, but also included political motive. He {{wanted to make the}} note that the KKK was likely using the cross as both a religious display as well as <b>an</b> obvious <b>political</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A piece {{where the}} singer speaks fondly to a sister {{that has come}} back from a trip to English Canada. Singer Karl Tremblay famously likes to make <b>a</b> humorous <b>political</b> <b>statement</b> on stage by {{replacing}} the verse Promise me that this time, you're staying home for good by Promise me that you didn't turn into a federalist, little dammit!

5000|$|The {{bridge was}} built in the {{unstable}} political era of the Civil War. Joseph J. Daniels made <b>a</b> clear <b>political</b> <b>statement</b> in naming the bridge after Andrew Jackson in honor of his statement to John Calhoun: [...] "To the Union, it must be preserved." [...] When first built, the bridge portal was lettered: [...] "The Federal Union: It must be preserved." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{contemporary}} Orthodox Judaism, {{there is}} a debate on the appropriateness of women wearing tzitzit which has hinged on whether women are allowed to perform commandments from which they are exempt. According to Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik the issue depends on the intention with which such an act is undertaken, e.g. whether {{it is intended to}} fulfill the actual commandment, to bring a person closer to the Almighty, or for political or protest purposes. Other commentators hold that women are prohibited generally, without making an individual inquiry. The view that women donning a tallit would be guilty of arrogance is cited as applying to attempts of making <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement</b> as to the ritual status of the genders, particularly in the Modern Orthodox community, are generally more inclined to regard contemporary women's intentions as religiously appropriate.|$|E
25|$|The Women's Memorial was {{designed}} by Glenna Goodacre for {{the women of the}} United States who served in the Vietnam War. The original winning entry of the Women's Memorial design contest was deemed unsuitable. Glenna Goodacre's entry received an honorable mention in the contest and she was asked to submit a modified maquette (design model). Goodacre's original design for the Women's Memorial statue included a standing figure of a nurse holding a Vietnamese baby, which although not intended as such, was deemed <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement,</b> and it was asked that this be removed. She replaced them with a figure of a kneeling woman holding an empty helmet. On November 11, 1993, the Vietnam Women's Memorial was dedicated. There is a smaller replica of that memorial at Vietnam Veterans Memorial State Park in Angel Fire, New Mexico.|$|E
500|$|... t's not a {{book with}} <b>a</b> <b>{{political}}</b> <b>statement.</b> It's... about {{a certain kind of}} political person, a kind of self-styled revolutionary that can only be produced by affluent societies. There's a great deal of playacting that I don't think you'd find in extreme left revolutionaries in societies where they have an immediate challenge.|$|E
50|$|In Switzerland, Vošnjak {{established}} {{contacts with}} Ante Trumbić, a Croatian emigrant from Dalmatia, {{and joined the}} Yugoslav Committee, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> interest group formed by South Slavs from Austria-Hungary aimed at the unification of the South Slavic peoples in an independent state. In 1917, {{he was among the}} signers of the Corfu Declaration, <b>a</b> joined <b>political</b> <b>statement</b> of the Yugoslav Committee and the representatives of the Kingdom of Serbia, which was {{the first step in the}} creation of Yugoslavia.|$|R

We {{were trying to make}} <b>a</b> strong <b>political</b> <b>statement</b> about the fluidity of sexuality with the dresses and make-up that we wore. We set out to confuse, and I guess Nancy Boy was the perfect soundtrack to that." ...|$|R
500|$|Beck made a {{supplemental}} filing {{in the case}} arguing the domain name was misleading and might lead individuals to believe it contained factual information. Eiland-Hall filed a [...] and stated Beck had depreciated {{the value of the}} First Amendment by attempting to evade its reach in a legal proceeding outside U.S. courts. On October 29, 2009, WIPO ruled against Beck, concluding that Eiland-Hall was making <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement</b> through parody in a justified usage of the Glenn Beck mark.|$|E
500|$|Bruegel painted The Blind {{the year}} before his death. [...] It has a bitter, sorrowful tone, which {{may be related to}} the {{establishment}} of the Council of Troubles in 1567 by the government of the Spanish Netherlands. [...] The council ordered mass arrests and executions to enforce Spanish rule and suppress Protestantism. [...] The placement of Sint-Anna Church of the village Sint-Anna-Pede has led to both pro- and anti-Catholic interpretations, though it is not clear that the painting was meant as <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E
500|$|Claimed as [...] "probably still {{today the}} best-known and best-loved poem in English", the Elegy quickly became popular. It was printed {{many times and}} {{in a variety of}} formats, {{translated}} into many languages, and praised by critics even after Gray's other poetry had fallen out of favour. Later critics tended to comment on its language and universal aspects, but some felt the ending was unconvincing—failing to resolve the questions the poem raised—or that the poem did not do enough to present <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>statement</b> that would serve to help the obscure rustic poor who form its central image.|$|E
5000|$|Kelly {{released}} his third album, Return of the Renegade, as [...] "Cap D" [...] in 2007. He described this album as {{more for the}} sake of hip-hop and less of <b>a</b> bold <b>political</b> <b>statement</b> than Insomnia had been. His fourth album, Polymath, was released in 2010, also under the alias of [...] "Cap D". Kot ranked it as the best indie Chicago album of that year.|$|R
