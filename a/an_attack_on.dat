5|$|After 1143 the war ground on, but {{progressing}} {{slightly better}} for Stephen. Miles of Gloucester, {{one of the}} most talented Angevin commanders, had died whilst hunting over the previous Christmas, relieving some of the pressure in the west. Geoffrey de Mandeville's rebellion continued until September 1144, when he died during <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Burwell. The war in the west progressed better in 1145, with the King recapturing Faringdon Castle in Oxfordshire. In the north, Stephen came to a fresh agreement with Ranulf of Chester, but then in 1146 repeated the ruse he had played on Geoffrey de Mandeville in 1143, first inviting Ranulf to court, before arresting him and threatening to execute him unless he handed over a number of castles, including Lincoln and Coventry. As with Geoffrey, the moment Ranulf was released he immediately rebelled, but the situation was a stalemate: Stephen had few forces in the north with which to prosecute a fresh campaign, whilst Ranulf lacked the castles to support <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Stephen. By this point, however, Stephen's practice of inviting barons to court and arresting them had brought him into some disrepute and increasing distrust.|$|E

As other elements from the brigade attacked from the east, No. 3 Commando, now under the command of Peter Bartholomew after Komrower had been posted to the Commando Training Depot, carried out a follow-up operation to the north. The operation was <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> a factory that had been producing V-2 rockets and after No. 3 Commando had captured it with the support of a number of tanks, a search found a number of these weapons, along with about 100 scientists who had been working in the factory.|$|E
