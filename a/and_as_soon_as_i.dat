500|$|Webb's {{invitation}} to join Caedmon's Call came from Tate, {{who at the}} time was attending Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, TX. Shortly afterward, Webb made the trip to Fort Worth and met future band mate Cliff Young. Webb says, [...] "I essentially just joined that band immediately. <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> joined the band, I quit college the same day." [...] As a result, for almost a full school year he pretended to go to class, with his family unaware he was actually pursuing the band in lieu of going to school.|$|E
500|$|... "get {{it out of}} here, get it {{away from}} the guys and myself. And I reached over, leaned over to the right, grabbed it with my hand, and I threw it as hard as I could, what I thought was at the time. <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> opened my hand to let it go, it just {{exploded}} instantly. And I came back, and the hand was completely severed off."The detonation amputated his right hand, and sprayed his body with shrapnel. Petry likely saved the two other soldiers from serious injury or death.|$|E
500|$|Christian Clemenson went to Harvard with Cuse {{but still}} {{went through the}} normal {{audition}} channels to get the part of Poole. Clemenson was apprehensive about pursuing one of the lead roles in a television show because of the long time commitments involved. He later said, [...] "The similarities between this show and The Wild Wild West, and my character to that show's Artemus Gordon, was an important hook for me. It {{was one of my}} favorite shows growing up, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> saw that Brisco County was based on the same kind of material and attitude as that show, I called my agent and said, 'I'll do anything I {{have to do to get}} this. Clemenson applied his experiences at Ivy League schools to play the uptight Poole. Praising Clemenson's work on Brisco, Cuse said, [...] "You can't give him anything he's not capable of doing. He adds the voice of intelligence and caution to balance our cast".|$|E

500|$|Sharma was {{recommended}} {{for the part}} of AJ by Nitin Ganatra (Masood) after the character was described to him, because producers wanted AJ and Masood to be funny together. The two actors had previously performed in comedy together in short film The Drop, Channel 4's Meet the Magoons and a programme called To Eat with Your Fingers, so Ganatra thought Sharma would be perfect for the role {{and he was the}} first person he thought of. Ganatra and the producers went through ideas of how a brother would affect Masood and what their relationship would be. Ganatra explained that he thought Masood only had one brother until he was told about AJ. When Sharma and Ganatra performed a scene together at Sharma's audition, the dialogue came so naturally to them that producers thought they were improvising, but, as Ganatra explained, they [...] "know each other's style [...] have all these shortcuts. It's like having a real brother." [...] Sharma was offered the part immediately after his interview. Sharma added in March 2013: [...] "I've known Nitin for years and he really lobbied for me to get the role of AJ, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> finished my audition the producers offered me the part and asked if I wanted a cup of tea, to which I replied, 'Yes please, I've waited 20 years for that cup of tea', but it's been really nice to just jump onto a set with someone I've already bonded with—it's like having a pre-built family to bounce off." [...] He had also previously worked with his co-stars Nina Wadia (Zainab) and Marc Elliott (Syed Masood), so felt it was [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "familiar" [...] to work with them. Sharma revealed in an interview with Inside Soap that his own mother always thought he should play Masood's brother after watching EastEnders for many years. The first scene Sharma filmed was with Ganatra on the set outside The Queen Victoria public house, and he found it [...] "really surreal".|$|E

Mother wanted to stop and save her jewel-case; but Father said: 'I refuse to let myself and my two children be burnt {{for the sake of}} your jewel-case.' We hurried downstairs, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was outside I woke up.|$|E
2500|$|Doll was honorably {{discharged}} from the military in June 1946 and returned to USC in time for summer practice. [...] In July 1946, Braven Dyer wrote that USC had found [...] "a new backfield star." [...] Dyer continued, [...] "Fresh out of the Marines, the lad's name is Doll, Don Doll, that is." [...] Doll had changed his surname from [...] "Burnside" [...] to [...] "Doll" [...] after being {{discharged from}} the military. [...] Doll later explained the reasoning behind his decision:"My stepfather, Adna Doll, raised me <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was old enough (and, incidentally, had dough for the legal transfer) I changed my name to his because I was grateful for all Dad had done for me. [...] I thought that if any honors came my way in football, I'd like to be known by his name." ...|$|E
