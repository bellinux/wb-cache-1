2500|$|Buhs {{contends that}} Bigfoot is a {{construct}} of popular imagination representing a [...] "tradition {{of the wild}} man" [...] that [...] "allowed white working-class men" [...] to hold onto traditional, masculine roles while societal changes (feminism and civil rights) in the 1960s and 1970s [...] "challenged their assumptions about society". Although Bigfoot {{has its roots in}} European and <b>Asian</b> <b>fairy</b> tales, and sightings of [...] "giant figures with long reddish hair" [...] were reported in the 1920s. Buhs claims Bigfoot stories in men's adventure magazines, like Argosy, True, and Saga, as well as [...] "mockumentary" [...] movies shown in makeshift movie theaters called [...] "four-wallers" [...] in 1970s rural America helped give shape to Bigfoot and secure its place in popular culture. Bigfoot became symbolic of the changes these men feared and way of connection with (or escaping into) the wilderness.|$|R
5000|$|Tamenaga Shunsui (extra=1790 - 11 February 1844) was the pen name of Sasaki Sadataka (...) , a Japanese novelist of the Edo period. In Japan, he is {{best known}} for the romantic novel Shunshoku Umegoyomi (Colors of Spring: The Plum Calendar) (1832-1833), the {{representative}} text in the ninjōbon genre. He followed up to this with sequels and his son, who called himself Shunsui Tamenaga Junior, continued the series. In Japan, he is considered a major writer of the Edo period, remembered for disobeying the Tenpō Reforms. He also wrote a version of the Chūshingura called [...] "Iroha Bunko". In Western literature, he is probably better known for his humorous story Longevity, which was translated by Yei Theodora Ozaki for her book Japanese Fairy Tales in 1903, and since then has been reprinted in some children's <b>Asian</b> <b>fairy</b> tale collections.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{population}} of the North Sea archipelago of Shetland, UK possesses a distinct sense of ethnic identity, which connects the island’s present-day community to that of its Old Norse/Viking settlers from Scandinavia. This sense of Viking ethnicity, however, is relatively recent, first arising in the 19 th Century. This paper argues that Shetland’s cultural identity must {{be understood in terms}} of the islands’ historical interconnectedness with trends in literature and scholarship in mainland Scotland, Britain, and Europe as a whole. Part II of this two-part paper looks at how the rise of nationalism and philological research into race and ethnicity in the 1800 s both drew upon and contributed to Shetlanders’ understanding of their history and culture. In the 1890 s, Edinburgh scholar David MacRitchie promoted a theory to explain European and <b>Asian</b> <b>fairy</b> folklore. This theory was grounded in the history of Orkney and Shetland and eventually made a significant impact in Shetland itself, being used by the author Jessie Saxby to promote a distinctive local identity concept. MacRitchie’s work also contributed to later research connected to the development of neopaganism and racist Nazi ideology. The conclusion concerns the role of isolated island communities within flows of cultural development and exchange...|$|R
50|$|The final {{programme}} looks at India's dwindling rainforests, now {{confined to the}} Western Ghats, upper Assam and Sri Lanka. The once extensive forests have been decimated by logging, firewood collection and hunting. In the opening scene, Valmik Thapar tracks lion-tailed macaques in southern India, a very rare fruit and seed eating monkey. In the Western Ghats, there are 120 species of amphibian, including flying frogs. Invertebrates use colour for camouflage, warning and defence, but mantises and crickets still fall prey to slow-moving chameleons. A faster reptile, the flying lizard, is shown gliding from tree to tree. Also filmed is the ancient practice of collecting honey from wild bees' nests high in the canopy. Birds visiting a fruiting fig tree include great Indian hornbills, Malabar grey hornbills, blossom-headed parakeets and <b>fairy</b> <b>bluebirds.</b> Mammals are also attracted by the fruit: Nilgiri langurs, bonnet macaques and Malabar giant squirrels. On the forest floor, wild boar and barking deer feed on the rejected figs, drawing a prowling leopard. Monkeys spot the danger and raise the alarm. The many varieties of fig tree provide food year-round for all these animals. Each fig is pollinated by a particular species of wasp, which lay their eggs in the fruits. Thapar visits the world's largest fig, a sacred banyan tree that draw pilgrims from far and wide. In the hill forests of southern India, Thapar tracks Nilgiri tahr on the grassy peaks. Here, the rains last for 6 months, creating huge waterfalls. The Sinharaja forest of Sri Lanka has more unique species than anywhere else on the subcontinent, including dozens of kinds of jumping spiders, each with their own courtship signals. A tiger is filmed stalking a rutting gaur herd. Gaur are the world's biggest cattle {{but they have been}} known to fall prey to tigers. The program ends on a sober note, filming elephants crossing tea plantations where forests once stood. The problem elephants are caught and trained as working animals. A wild calf is shown being caught by lasso. The distressed animal is broken by torture, but it is also worshipped: one of the paradoxes of the subcontinent.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} critically investigates how German {{culture is}} transculturated in Japan and in South Korea and then reproduced {{in a new}} form of manga/manhwa. These visual representations are evidence of a long history of German literary transculturation amid Japanese and Korean reading culture. Beginning with moral education materials in the 1880 s, I trace the widespread reception of Grimms' fairy tales in East Asia and argue that the success of the translations of the tales was due to the particularly successful fusion of Confucian values with the Western story form. German literature first entered the Japanese reading culture through the Grimms' fairytales as a moral education tool. The reading reception shifted from educational space to private space and Japanese reader began to enjoy the Grimms' fairytales outside of the classroom, which contributed to the spread of German literature. This led to a veritable Grimm boom {{at the end of the}} twentieth century, including a corpus of critical analysis by <b>Asian</b> scholars and <b>fairy</b> tale retellings from feminist perspectives that creatively fuse ideas of East and West. The globalization of manga, in turn, contributed to the scholarly discourse in the West, which nourished a rethinking and redeployment of complex borrowing practices between Asian and German literatures. From the impact of Grimms' fairy tales, I trace the reception of the German literature in the Japanese pop literature medium manga and analyze Grimms Manga by the Japanese manga artist Kei Isiyama. Grimms' fairy tales paved the way for the entry of German literature and I investigate Yoko Tawada's works, who writes in Japanese and in German and incorporates fairy tale tropes and the legacy of German romanticism in the age of transnational globalization through her visual descriptive writing. I examine the Japanese author Kouhei Kadono, whose works, I claim, display the romantic themes of the German Romantics and Richard Wagner's nationalistic ideological views of societal changes. I then shift from German literature' influence in Japan to South Korea and I juxtapose the manhwa The Tarot Café with Goethe's Faust to investigate gender roles. After displaying German transculturation in the selected works, I argue that manga contributes to the German classroom as part of a multiliteracies framework in a collegiate language classroom...|$|R
