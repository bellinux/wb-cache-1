5|$|In total, {{during his}} college career Tittle set school passing records with 162 {{completions}} out of 330 attempts for 2,525 yards and 23 touchdowns. He scored seven touchdowns himself as <b>a</b> <b>runner.</b> His passing totals remained unbroken until Bert Jones surpassed {{them in the}} 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Several basic {{offensive}} tactics {{come into}} play with <b>a</b> <b>runner</b> on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating {{a gap in the}} infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even {{at the expense of the}} batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with <b>a</b> <b>runner</b> on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With <b>a</b> <b>runner</b> on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} player's turn batting or plate {{appearance is}} complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball {{that results in}} the team's third out, {{even if it is}} recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, <b>a</b> <b>runner</b> getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. <b>A</b> <b>runner</b> may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more liberal substitution rules.|$|E

5|$|If <b>a</b> <b>runner</b> {{advances}} {{because the}} defense {{does nothing to}} try to stop the advance, the scorer may rule that the advance was due to defensive indifference and no stolen base is credited. However, a throw is not required for a stolen base. If a fielder begins to visibly make an attempt to prevent an advance but then elects not to throw, the advance is not due to defensive indifference.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test of {{the series}} at Nottingham, Davidson removed Cowdrey before his ankle slipped in a {{footmark}} during the first innings and a bone was chipped. He was carried off with figures of 1/22 and his ankle plastered. The injury was such that {{he was unable to}} bat even with the assistance of <b>a</b> <b>runner</b> and was absent. This injury sidelined him until August.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to record two outs {{in the course of}} the same play. This is called a double play. Even three outs in one play, a triple play, {{is possible}}, though this is very rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. <b>A</b> <b>runner</b> may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty of runners.|$|E

5|$|Lindwall {{lined up}} for the First Test at Trent Bridge, where he had taken six wickets in the tour game. Australia bowled first, and Lindwall took the wicket of Cyril Washbrook, before {{he was forced to}} leave the field with a groin strain with figures of 1/30. Lindwall {{returned}} in Australia's innings, batting at No. 9 without <b>a</b> <b>runner,</b> where he partnered vice-captain Hassett (137) in a century partnership to lift Australia's score to 509 to take a 344 run lead. Lindwall could not bowl in the second innings as Australia completed an eight wicket victory.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{initially}} {{appeared to}} be recovering, but took {{a turn for the}} worse on September 13 as his wounds became gangrenous, and died early the next morning; Vice President Theodore Roosevelt succeeded him. Roosevelt was hiking near the top of Mt. Marcy, in New York State's Adirondack region, when <b>a</b> <b>runner</b> located him to convey the bad news. After McKinley's murder, for which Czolgosz was put to death in the electric chair, the United States Congress passed legislation to officially charge the Secret Service with the responsibility for protecting the president.|$|E
5|$|Ryan {{finished}} {{the game with}} 35rushing yards, just one short of Hokie quarterback Tyrod Taylor, who had been highly promoted as <b>a</b> <b>runner</b> heading into the game. Ryan finished fourth among all rushers, and Eagle running back Andre Callender, the sole running back on the Eagles' roster, finished second, rushing for 51yards in the game. Callender game-long 11-yard run helped set up the Eagles for a field goal attempt {{early in the second}} quarter.|$|E
50|$|If {{a batter}} reaches first base because of {{offensive}} interference by <b>a</b> preceding <b>runner</b> (including if <b>a</b> preceding <b>runner</b> is {{hit by a}} batted ball), he is also credited with a hit.|$|R
50|$|An {{invisible}} runner normally travels at {{the speed}} of the current batter. For example, assume <b>an</b> invisible <b>runner</b> on first base while the batter hits the ball. If the fielding team reaches second base before the batter reaches first base, the invisible runner is out. Otherwise, the invisible runner is considered safe. Similarly, <b>an</b> invisible <b>runner</b> advances only as many bases as the actual runner. For example, if <b>an</b> invisible <b>runner</b> is on second base and the batter hits a single to the outfield, the invisible runner only proceeds to third, even though <b>a</b> physical <b>runner</b> would often score in a similar scenario.|$|R

5|$|The force out: {{recorded}} against <b>a</b> <b>runner</b> who {{is required}} to attempt to advance—either because the runner is on first base and a batted ball lands in fair territory, or because the runner immediately behind on the basepath is thus required to attempt to advance—but fails to reach the next base before a fielder touches the base while holding the ball. The ground out is technically a special case of the force out.|$|E
5|$|The head {{linesman}} {{is positioned}} {{on one end}} of the line of scrimmage. He watches for any line-of-scrimmage and illegal use-of-hands violations and assists the line judge with illegal shift or illegal motion calls. The head linesman also rules on out-of-bounds calls that happen on his side of the field, oversees the chain crew and marks the forward progress of <b>a</b> <b>runner</b> when a play has been whistled dead.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{gameplay}} issues when the player takes {{their turn to}} bat. The AI is not developed and, when the player hits a pitch, it nearly always takes the longest possible route to the ball, making runs easier to score. It also lacks the capability to throw out <b>a</b> <b>runner</b> who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform a double play after catching a fly ball. Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box.|$|E
50|$|In {{light of}} this observation, the {{original}} paper and both reviews suggest that phenethylamine plays {{a prominent role in}} mediating the mood-enhancing euphoric effects of <b>a</b> <b>runner's</b> high, as both phenethylamine and amphetamine are potent euphoriants.|$|R
50|$|The {{club was}} {{initially}} rewarded with good league positions but not high enough for further promotion. The worst season {{after returning to}} the Isthmians came when the two Division Twos were split in 1991 and {{a place in the}} new Division Three had to suffice. This position was quickly rectified with <b>a</b> <b>runner’s</b> up slot in 1992. The club also reached the quarter finals of the FA Vase, emulating a similar performance in 1987-88. One year later, 102 points and <b>a</b> <b>runner’s</b> up promotion place to Division One was nailed. The League Cup was also secured together with the Carlsberg Trophy in the same campaign along with the League Charity Shield.|$|R
