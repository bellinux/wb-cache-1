5|$|The {{arrival of}} Martin Harlinghausen saw {{operations}} expand, targeting Alicante, Almeria, Barcelona and Cartegena. As naval activity declined, inland targets became more numerous, and night missions began.

In total, eleven men were killed in action, and five others died due to <b>accident</b> <b>or</b> illness.|$|E

5|$|Favorinus {{argued that}} it was absurd to imagine that stars and planets would affect human bodies {{in the same way as}} they affect the tides, and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates. Sextus Empiricus {{argued that it}} was absurd to link human {{attributes}} with myths about the signs of the zodiac. Carneades argued that belief in fate denies free will and morality; that people born at different times can all die in the same <b>accident</b> <b>or</b> battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} work was exhaustive, involving {{the filming of}} numerous churches in Norfolk, both ancient and more modern. Many of the clergymen featured in the programme were discovered by <b>accident</b> <b>or</b> by word-of-mouth. For example, the production researcher managed to find, on request, a vicar who had an extensive model railway in his rectory, another whose ministry was based on water (the Chaplain of the Broads) and a vicar whose congregation at the time numbered zero.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 539 such accidents, {{including}} terrorist or other attacks. Of these, 198 have involved at least 100 fatalities, 33 {{have had at}} least 200 fatalities, 8 {{have had at least}} 300 fatalities, and 4 accidents have had at least 500 fatalities. Between 1923 (the first year an aircraft <b>accident</b> <b>or</b> incident exceeded 50 fatalities) and the present, these accidents have involved 571 aircraft across all seven continents and the three largest oceans, and have accounted for 56,669 fatalities.|$|E

5|$|An away team boards the cube, {{discovering}} that either an <b>accident</b> <b>or</b> another species disabled the vessel. They take a Borg drone back onto Voyager, where the Doctor (Robert Picardo) accidentally revives it. After {{being told by}} Frazier to remain where he is, Chakotay breaks {{out of his room}} where he sees that all the people around him on the alien planet possess Borg implant technology in their bodies. Frazier explains that an electro-kinetic storm broke their link with the Borg hive mind. Instead, the separated drones settled on a nearby planet. Chakotay's health gets worse, and the ex-Borg offer to connect him to a joint mind to heal his injuries, and he reluctantly accepts. Once part of the hive mind, he sees a montage of their memories. After Voyager arrives, Frazier and her group want Janeway to re-activate the neuroelectric generator on the damaged cube to extend a new joint mind across the entire planet.|$|E
5|$|Contact {{with skin}} is dangerous, and {{adequate}} ventilation {{should be provided}} when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin. Exposure by inhalation should not exceed 0.1mg per cubic metre in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium will readily absorb through the skin and care {{should be taken to}} avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received by inhalation at the PEL. Thallium is a suspected human carcinogen. For a long time thallium compounds were readily available as rat poison. This fact and that it is water-soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxication caused by <b>accident</b> <b>or</b> criminal intent.|$|E
5|$|Despite many {{attendees}} at the festival, {{there were}} relatively few witnesses, and the incident {{did not cause}} any delay in the main proceedings. Journalists and others knew {{that they would not}} be able to publish any photographs or movies, so those aware of the incident did not bother recording it other than by accident, nor did any try to investigate it afterward. Most of the few photographs of the incidents have been destroyed or forgotten and lost. Siwiec was censored out of official photographs of the Central Photographic Agency (Centralna Agencja Fotograficzna), which had a monopoly on issuing photos for the press in the era of communist Poland. His act was captured in a 7-second film by a motion picture camera of the Polish Film Chronicle, but the official newsreels of the festival omitted any mention of the incident. This footage however survived, mislabeled either by <b>accident</b> <b>or</b> purpose, until it was rediscovered over twenty years later.|$|E

5|$|Tromp on Christianus Quintus, Vice Admiral Jens Rodsten on Tre Løver and Niels Juel on Churprindsen took {{advantage}} of the chaos. They quickly surrounded Svärdet and three supporting ships (Hieronymus, Neptunus and Järnvågen, an armed merchantman) and began to hammer them into submission. Several other Swedish vessels attempted to assist Uggla, but they were in a lee position and could not provide effective support. After about an hour-and-a-half to two hours of hard fighting Svärdets mainmast went overboard and Uggla had to surrender to Tromp. Despite this, Svärdet was ignited by <b>accident</b> <b>or</b> misunderstanding by the Dutch fireship t Hoen. The second largest Swedish ship after Kronan sank in the blaze and took with it 600 out of a crew of 650, including Admiral Uggla himself. Only Hieronymus escaped the assault by the allied admirals, though badly damaged, and the others were captured by Juel on Churprindsen together with one of his lieutenants on Anna Sophia.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{returned}} to Southampton in June {{where it was}} visited by King Henry. In August the fleet sailed for Brest where it encountered a joint, but ill-coordinated, French-Breton fleet {{at the battle of}} St. Mathieu. The English with one of the great ships in the lead (according to Marsden the Mary Rose) battered the French ships with heavy gunfire and forced them to retreat. The Breton flagship Cordelière put up a fight and was boarded by the 1,000-ton Regent. By <b>accident</b> <b>or</b> through the unwillingness of the Breton crew to surrender, the powder magazine of the Cordelière caught fire and blew up in a violent explosion, setting fire to the Regent and eventually sinking her. About 180 English crew members saved themselves by throwing themselves into the sea and only a handful of Bretons survived, only to be captured. The captain of the Regent, 600 soldiers and sailors, the High Admiral of France and the steward of the town of Morlaix were killed in the incident, making it the focal point of several contemporary chronicles and reports. On , the English burnt 27 French ships, captured another five and landed forces near Brest to raid and take prisoners, but storms forced the fleet back to Dartmouth in Devon and then to Southampton for repairs.|$|E
