40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in the amount and complexity of traffic on Dutch inland waterways. Traffic management shifted from local traffic control to corridor traffic management. Due to these changes, operators in nautical traffic management centers experience difficulty to gain and maintain sufficient situation awareness. In our previous research, three groups of deficiencies of current situation awareness support have been identified. To overcome these deficiencies, a theoretical framework for information engineering user interface concepts was developed and used for designing three interface concepts. A coherent, an integrated and a context-dependent <b>adaptable</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> were designed and implemented as testable prototypes. To support the process of information engineering, we combined user-centered design techniques with the formalism of set theory, directed graphs and semantic networks. From a methodological point of view, these proved to be useful both in conceptualization and implementation of the concepts. The usability of these concepts was tested in a simulator environment. The results show that the implemented prototypes represent an important improvement compared to the traditional interface solutions currently used by nautical traffic management operators. However, it was recognized that the coherent user interface implementation still suffered from a number of deficiencies. The context-dependent <b>adaptable</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> was evaluated most positively. </p...|$|E

However, experimental studies have questioned their effectiveness, while the introduction of adaptation techniques in commercial applications has had limited success.

40|$|<b>User</b> <b>Interface</b> Adaptation {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{in recent years as}} a means to achieve personalized accessibility and usability of <b>user</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Related <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> architectures, as well as a variety of related development method and tools, have also been elaborated. Admittedly, however, despite the recognized validity of the approach, which has been proved in practice in a series of prototype systems, the wider adoption and uptake of <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> adaptation approaches is still limited. One of identified obstacles is the complexity intrinsic in designing such interfaces, and the need of radically revising the current <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> design practice to account for (i) the alternative designs required for adaptation, (ii) the parameters involved in driving adaptations (i. e., selecting among alternatives at a given point during interaction), and (iii) the logic of adaptation at run-time. This paper proposes a two-fold tool-based support strategy for <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> adaptation development, based on: (i) an adaptation development toolkit and related widget library which directly embeds lexical level adaptations into common interactive widgets, and (ii) embedding such a library in a common integrated development environment, thus allowing designers to define and view alternative adaptations at design time, and create <b>adaptable</b> <b>user</b> <b>interfaces</b> through traditional prototyping. The above approach has been implemented in the domain of adaptable applications for older users, producing tools which are currently in use {{in the development of a}} large suite of interactive applications in various domains. The approach presented in this paper is claimed to be the first and so far unique supporting rapid prototyping of <b>adaptable</b> <b>user</b> <b>interfaces,</b> thus minimizing the divergence between typical development practices and <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> adaptation development. 1...|$|R

Growing {{abundance}} {{of information on}} the Internet, especially the Next Generation Internet, poses even more challenges on more efficient information management; hence it has brought attention of the researchers to the faceted navigation. Existing solutions, however, do not address the majority of users, who are still inexperienced in using the faceted navigation solutions or who do not understand underlying concepts of the Semantic Web technologies, or both. The query refinement process, while using the faceted navigation interface, is more complex than, e. g., refining a simple keyword-based query. In this article we present MultiBeeBrowse (MBB), an accessible faceted navigation solution that solves aforementioned problems in the browsing environment. We present how to improve users ’ access to their history of refinements; we discuss how users can share their browsing experience.

We show how adapt-able UIs can be built by introducing coloured Petri nets to connect the UI’s physi-cal representation with the system to be controlled. UI development benefits from formal modelling approaches regarding the derived close integration of creation, ex-ecution, and reconfiguration of formal UI models. Thus, adaptation does not only change the physical representation, but also the connecting Petri net. For the latter transformation, we enhance the DPO rewriting formalism by using an order on the set of labels and softening the label-preserving property of morphisms, i. e., an ele-ment can also be mapped to another element if the label is larger. We use lattices to ensure correctness and state application conditions of rewriting steps. Finally we define an order compatible with our framework for the use in our implementation...|$|R

Our system is highly flexible because it allows the user to customize the interface as follows: (1) hotspot areas can be created anywhere within the camera-captured image; (2) new commands can be assigned to particular hotspots or composite hotspot sequences (e. g., right_left for previous webpage; up+right+down for webpage reload); (3) a physical workspace on the desktop can be defined by pointing the camera to any location; (4) different hotspot layouts for different applications can be created and saved.

40|$|The PhD work {{presented}} in this abstract is performed {{as part of the}} EMERGENCY project. The project develops decision support tools for mobile users in emergency response. A main difficulty when developing on-site end user solutions for emergency response is the need for flexibility. The solutions need to be flexible with regards to type of operation, special needs for the given operation, available and needed information sources, applications and services, available and needed sensors, available infrastructure, type of equipment to be used, work situation of the user, and modalities to exploit. ICT support for mobile workers in emergency response needs to integrate information and services from a number of existing ICT systems and sensors applied to the operational area [1]. Such ICT support must be highly adaptable both to the type of operation, characteristics of the operation at hand, and incidents happening during the operation, as well as the available types of equipment and the current user situation (e. g. degree of mobility). These requirements for flexibility have at least two implications. Firstly, that developing optimal solutions for all combination of needs will be utterly expensive. Secondly, that {{it is almost impossible to}} specify an optimal end user solution in advance. Thus, there is a need for development support that makes it easy to compose support tools, partly at design time and partly at run time. The PhD work will address methods and languages for specifying <b>adaptable</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> components and the necessary framework for composing them at design- and run time. To solve the main problem outlined above, we will use model-based approaches for user interface development.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the design and development of a prototype implementation of a Rehabilitation Robotic manipulator based on a novel kinematic configuration. The initial aim of the research was to identify appropriate design criteria for the design of a user interface and control system, and for the subsequent evaluation of the manipulator prototype. This led to a review of the field of rehabilitation robotics, focusing on user evaluations of existing systems. The review showed that the design objectives of individual projects were often contradictory, and that a requirement existed for a more general and complete set of design criteria. These were identified through an analysis of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} existing systems, including an assessment of manipulator performances, commercial success and user feedback. The resulting criteria were used for the design and development of a novel interface and control system for the Middlesex Manipulator - the novel scariculated robotic system. A highly modular architecture was adopted, allowing the manipulator to provide a level of adaptability not approached by existing rehabilitation robotic systems. This allowed the interface to be configured to match the controlling ability and input device selections of individual users. A range of input devices was employed, offering variation in communication mode and bandwidth. These included a commercial voice recognition system, and a novel gesture recognition device. The later was designed using electrolytic tilt sensors, the outputs of which were encoded by artificial neural networks. These allowed for control of the manipulator through head or hand gestures. An individual with spinal-cord injury undertook a single-subject user evaluation of the Middlesex Manipulator over a period of four months. The evaluation provided evidence for the value of adaptability presented by the user interface. It was also shown that the prototype did not currently confonn to all the design criteria, but allowed for the identification of areas for design improvements. This work led to a second research objective, concerned with the problem of configuring an <b>adaptable</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> for a specific individual. A novel form of task analysis is presented within the thesis, that allows the relative usability of interface configurations to be predicted based upon individual user and input device characteristics. An experiment was undertaken with 6 subjects performing 72 tasks runs with 2 interface configurations controlled by user gestures. Task completion times fell within the range predicted, where the range was generated using confidence intervals (α = 0. 05) on point estimates of user and device characteristics. This allowed successful prediction over all task runs of the relative task completion times of interface configurations for a given user...|$|E

Being a software system in itself, UI possesses certain attributes or non-functional requirements (NFRs) such as usability, reliability, simplicity, unambiguity, etc. However, recently, adaptability is emerging as an important characteristic for UI systems. Briefly, adaptability {{is the ability of}} a system to accommodate changes in its environment.

In order to validate the architectures generated by the tool, we used the domain of embedded systems, in particular, test systems.
