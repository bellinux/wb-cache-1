5|$|On 2 February 1996, {{the tunnel}} company had an {{agreement}} with Bru og Tunnelskelskapet, which operates the Bergen Toll Ring, to collect the tolls in the tunnel using the Autopass <b>automatic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> system. A manual collection system was estimated to cost NOK1.4 million per year, while an automated system was estimated at NOK0.4 million. The tunnel opened on 7 May 1996, {{the same day the}} last ferry ran. Originally the plan was to charge tolls similar to the ferry. With a manual system, it would not be possible to charge for two-wheeled vehicles and passengers, so the fares for other vehicles were raised slightly. In 1995, it had cost NOK44 for a single passing with a car on the ferry. The tolls were set to NOK120 for all types of vehicles, except two-wheelers, and NOK72 was charged per travel with pre-paid ticket books. Bus riders had to pay for two extra zones. The toll plaza was open a few hour each week to allow people to purchase discounted tickets.|$|E

5000|$|The 2002 Winter Olympics {{prompted}} {{an urgent}} {{acceleration of the}} already planned massive overhaul of I-15, from 600 North in Salt Lake City to 10600 South in Sandy. The interstate was expanded to ten lanes, including two high-occupancy vehicle (HOV/express) lanes. Portions of I-80 and I-215 were also reconstructed. [...] Since original construction, the HOV lanes have been evolved to what the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) refers to as Express Lanes. These Express Lanes, also known as High-occupancy toll lanes (HOT lanes) are for use by vehicles with two or more persons (including buses), motorcycles, and clean-fuel vehicles. Other vehicles can also use the lanes if they use an Express Pass. The Express Pass allows for <b>automatic</b> electronic <b>toll</b> <b>collection.</b> <b>Tolls</b> vary by distance driven in the lanes and current traffic congestion.|$|R
50|$|Toll {{roads in}} some form have existed since antiquity, {{collecting}} their fees from passing travellers on foot, wagon or horseback; but their prominence increased {{with the rise of}} the automobile, and many modern tollways charge fees for motor vehicles exclusively. The amount of the toll usually varies by vehicle type, weight, or number of axles, with freight trucks often charged higher rates than cars. Tolls are collected at points known as toll booths, toll houses, plazas, stations, bars, or gates. Some <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> points are unmanned and the user deposits money in a machine which opens the gate once the correct toll has been paid. To cut costs and minimise time delay many tolls today are collected by some form of <b>automatic</b> or electronic <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> equipment which communicates electronically with a toll payer's transponder. Some electronic toll roads also maintain a system of toll booths so people without transponders can still pay the toll, but many newer roads now use automatic number plate recognition to bill drivers who use the road without a transponder, and some older toll roads are being upgraded with such systems.|$|R

50|$|As {{early as}} 1989, the tollway {{authority}} had discussed implementing <b>automatic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> {{across the entire}} system to relieve congestion caused by traffic stopping at mainline toll barriers. The tollway authority began testing I-Pass, the tollway system's electronic payment method, on the entire stretch of I-355 in 1993 at various tollbooths; by September 1994, every plaza on I-355 accepted I-Pass. By 1998, the tollway authority had installed dedicated I-Pass lanes (lanes specifically set aside for electronic toll collections) at both mainline toll barriers. In 1999, I-355 became the first tollway to receive I-Pass Express Lanes (also known as open road tolling, or ORT). With {{the installation of the}} express lanes, vehicles with I-Pass could be tolled at highway speeds of 55 mph. In 2005, the tollway authority widened the express lanes from two lanes to three lanes in each direction. This allowed the number of express lanes to match the number of travel lanes on the tollway.|$|E

In an open system, the users pay the toll in either {{entrance}} or exit gate, while in a closed system, they take a ticket in the entrance gate and pay the toll in the exit gate. The structure of open and closed <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> systems can be simulated to get optimum locations that would generate the highest revenue.
