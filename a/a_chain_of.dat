In the present paper, we describe a method {{which can be}} used for classifying general dense near polygons with such <b>a</b> <b>chain.</b> We will use this method to determine all dense near polygons with <b>a</b> nice <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> subpolygons if every hex is either classical or glued. We will apply the latter result to determine all dense near octagons of order (3,t) with <b>a</b> nice <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> subpolygons...|$|R
