5|$|An old {{belief is}} that the {{southwest}} corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under <b>a</b> <b>staircase,</b> or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|Chronophotograpic {{studies of}} animals in motion, created by {{scientist}} Étienne-Jules Marey beginning in the 1880s, led to the introduction in painting of techniques to show motion, such as blurring, multiplication, and superimposition of body parts—perhaps {{in an effort to}} imitate these mechanical images. Such multiplication can be see in Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending <b>a</b> <b>Staircase,</b> No. 2, painted the same year as Balla's painting.|$|E
5|$|The basement, and {{for part}} of the home's history, the main living area, is {{accessed}} via <b>a</b> <b>staircase</b> {{at the back of the}} first-floor hall.

5|$|The kitchen, oratory {{and great}} chamber rose two floors, {{therefore}} only the minstrels' gallery was accessed via the main staircase {{on the second}} floor. However, the butlery and pantry was single-storeyed, but held the butler's chamber (with a garderobe) above it, accessed either via <b>a</b> <b>staircase</b> in that room or via the gallery.|$|E
5|$|The large {{triangular}} plaza on {{the west}} side of One World Trade Center, facing the Hudson River, was originally planned to have stainless steel steps descending to the street. However, the steps were changed to a terrace in the final design. The terrace can be accessed through <b>a</b> <b>staircase</b> on Vesey Street. The terrace is paved in granite, and has 12 sweetgum trees, in addition to a block-long planter/bench.|$|E

5000|$|When Durie Hill {{became part}} of Wanganui Borough in 1910, access was via <b>a</b> {{concrete}} <b>staircase</b> (<b>a</b> 191-step <b>staircase</b> still exists today). The Council needed to provide public transport to the hilltop settlement, however. Various solutions including a cable car were proposed, but an elevator up thorough the hill was decided upon, as [...] "the most convenient, the safest, the most economical, and the most suited for {{the circumstances of the}} particular locality".|$|R

5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when preaching to a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women how they had enjoyed them, {{to be told that}} they had no real interest in the subject itself, but they loved to hear him speak. The character of the college provost in the <b>A</b> <b>Staircase</b> in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was based on that of Chadwick.|$|E
5|$|A {{glass screen}} {{separated}} {{the first class}} platform and circulating area from the platform and circulating area for third class passengers. The third class section was entered from the secondary entrance in Newnham Terrace, and was more sparsely furnished and not equipped with lifts. From the Newnham Terrace entrance <b>a</b> <b>staircase</b> led to a single communal waiting room on the first floor, and to the third class platform on the second floor, much shorter than the first class platform.|$|E

5|$|Federal Hill is made {{primarily}} of brick fired on-site and {{laid in the}} Flemish bond pattern. The mansion possesses a foundation crafted of limestone native to the surrounding countryside. The windowsills and mantels were finely carved by a free black craftsman. The mansion is designed in the Federal Style. Federal Hill has three floors traversed by <b>a</b> <b>staircase</b> located within a central hallway on each floor and an English basement. The first floor's main rooms are a dining room, parlor, and library. The second floor consists of three bedrooms similarly spaced to the rooms below.|$|E

Here, the bank splits and there are two separate tubes of two escalators and a stair each to each platform. The platform elevator has its own two turnstiles, and makes three stops (mezzanine, upper platform, lower platform).|$|E
5|$|In 1843, {{the manor}} house was {{destroyed}} by fire, news of which was carried in The Illustrated London News. The estate passed into the Court of Chancery and was purchased by Daniel Higford Davall Burr. In 1848, Burr commissioned {{the building of a}} neoclassical mansion to the south west of the original building. Burr saved the 17th-century manor's wooden staircase, though all that remains of the building is <b>a</b> <b>staircase</b> to the cellar (which is now home to a colony of bats). By 1851 the new building was complete, costing £20,000 and having a Tudor-like appearance. Burr held the estate until his death 50 years later, when was inherited by his son, who sold it in 1893.|$|E

5|$|In 1913 the brothel was {{expanded}} again. A one-story structure {{was added to}} the building, increasing the number of cribs by eight; four of the added cribs opened directly onto Pleasant Alley, by that time known as Venus Alley. When copper prices went up, the more than 14,000 miners in the city experienced a pay-rise of twenty-five cents and injected an additional $6,000 into Butte's economy. The Dumas also experienced an upswing in patronage. As a result of the added patronage, the brothel added five partitions and <b>a</b> <b>staircase</b> in 1916, and the ground floor, once a grand parlor, was partitioned into cribs.|$|E
5|$|On the 42nd Street {{side of the}} Chrysler Building, <b>a</b> <b>staircase</b> {{from the}} street leads {{directly}} under the building to the New York City Subway station at Grand Central–42nd Street. It {{is part of the}} structure's original design. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which at the time was the operator of all the routes serving the 42nd Street station, originally sued to block construction of the new entrance because it would cause crowding, but the New York City Board of Transportation pushed to allow the corridor anyway. Chrysler eventually built and paid for the building's subway entrance. Work on the new entrance started in March 1930 and it opened along with the Chrysler Building two months later.|$|E
5|$|Spears {{talked to}} CNN about her {{involvement}} {{during the development}} of the tour, stating that she had designed the entire tour herself, including costumes and concept. Spears worked with fashion designer Gia Ventola to create the costumes for her and the dancers. The proscenium stage was simple and had only one main prop, <b>a</b> <b>staircase</b> in the middle. The band was in both sides of the staircase and consisted of five musicians. There were also six dancers, that took the stage during interludes. The setlist consisted of eight songs from her debut album and several covers by well-known artists.|$|E
