5|$|In {{diaphragm}} cell electrolysis, an asbestos (or polymer-fiber) diaphragm separates a cathode and an <b>anode,</b> {{preventing the}} chlorine forming at the <b>anode</b> from re-mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode. The salt solution (brine) is continuously fed to the <b>anode</b> compartment and {{flows through the}} diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the caustic alkali is produced and the brine is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali, {{but they are not}} burdened with the problem of mercury disposal and they are more energy efficient.|$|E
5|$|The <b>anode</b> sludges {{contain the}} selenides and tellurides of the noble metals in {{compounds}} with the formula M2Se or M2Te (M = Cu, Ag, Au). At temperatures of 500 °C the <b>anode</b> sludges are roasted with sodium carbonate under air. The metal ions {{are reduced to}} the metals, while the telluride is converted to sodium tellurite.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary white {{powdered}} {{zinc oxide}} {{can be produced}} in the laboratory by electrolyzing a solution of sodium bicarbonate with a zinc <b>anode.</b> Zinc hydroxide and hydrogen gas are produced. The zinc hydroxide upon heating decomposes to zinc oxide.|$|E
50|$|Prebaked <b>anodes</b> {{contain a}} smaller {{percentage}} of pitch, {{as they need}} to be more solid than Söderberg <b>anodes.</b> The remains of prebaked <b>anodes</b> are used to make more new prebaked <b>anodes.</b> Prebaked <b>anodes</b> either are made in the same factory where electrolysis happens or are brought there from elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|A sulfate-based bath {{that uses}} lead <b>anodes</b> {{surrounded}} by boxes filled with sulfuric acid (known as shielded <b>anodes),</b> which keeps the trivalent chromium from oxidizing at the <b>anodes.</b>|$|R
30|$|Si {{microwire}} array <b>anodes</b> {{have been}} prepared by an economical, microelectronics compatible method based on macropore etching. In the present report, evidence of the scalability {{of the process and}} the areal capacity of the <b>anodes</b> is presented. The <b>anodes</b> exhibit record areal capacities for Si-based <b>anodes.</b> The gravimetric capacity of longer <b>anodes</b> is comparable to the one of shorter <b>anodes</b> at moderate lithiation/delithiation rates. The diffusion limitation of the lithium ions through the electrolyte in depth among the wires is the limiting factor for cycling longer wires at high rates.|$|R
5|$|Zinc is {{also used}} as an <b>anode</b> {{material}} for batteries such as in zinc–carbon batteries or zinc-air battery/fuel cells.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{vanadium}} oxide {{has been proposed}} {{for use as a}} high energy density <b>anode</b> for lithium ion batteries, at 745Wh/L when paired with a lithium cobalt oxide cathode. Vanadium phosphates have been proposed as the cathode in the Lithium Vanadium Phosphate Battery, another type of lithium ion battery.|$|E
5|$|Manganese(IV) oxide {{was used}} in the {{original}} type of dry cell battery as an electron acceptor from zinc, and is the blackish material in carbon–zinc type flashlight cells. The manganese dioxide is reduced to the manganese oxide-hydroxide MnO(OH) during discharging, preventing the formation of hydrogen at the <b>anode</b> of the battery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anodes</b> {{are subject}} {{to a variety of}} {{mechanical}} stresses during creation, transportation and use. <b>Anodes</b> must be resistant to compressive force, resistant to elastic stress, and resistant to impact without becoming brittle. The relationship between compressive strength and Young's modulus in prebaked <b>anodes</b> usually results in a compromise in the <b>anode's</b> resistance to compressive force and elastic stresses.|$|R
40|$|Thin-film {{electrodes}} of a plasma-sprayed Li-Si alloy {{were evaluated}} {{for use as}} <b>anodes</b> in high-temperature thermally activated (thermal) batteries. These <b>anodes</b> were prepared using 44 % Li/ 56 % Si (w/w) material as feed material in a special plasma-spray apparatus under helium or hydrogen, to protect this air- and moisture-sensitive material during deposition. <b>Anodes</b> were tested in single cells using conventional pressed-powder separators and lithiated pyrite cathodes at temperatures of 400 to 550 C at several different current densities. A limited number of 5 -cell battery tests were also conducted. The data for the plasma-sprayed <b>anodes</b> was compared to that for conventional pressed-powder <b>anodes.</b> The performance of the plasma-sprayed <b>anodes</b> was inferior to that of conventional pressed-powder <b>anodes,</b> in that the cell emfs were lower (due {{to the lack of}} formation of the desired alloy phases) and the small porosity of these materials severely limited their rate capability. Consequently, plasma-sprayed Li-Si <b>anodes</b> would not be practical for use in thermal batteries...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} H 2 S on the {{hydrogen}} oxidation on Ni/gadolinia doped ceria (Ni/GDC) <b>anodes</b> with/without Pd-impregnation was investigated using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic polarization techniques at 800 oC. The polarization performance of Ni/GDC <b>anodes</b> degraded rapidly {{and the presence}} of 100 ppm H 2 S in H 2 fuel causes structural damage to the Ni/GDC <b>anodes</b> after polarized at 200 mA/cm 2 for 55 h. The infiltrated Pd nanoparticles significantly reduce the electrode polarization resistance, and promote the stability of the Ni/GDC <b>anodes.</b> The impregnated Pd nanoparticles on the surface of Ni/GDC <b>anodes</b> significantly reduced the structural damage and modification effect of H 2 S on the Ni and GDC particles of the <b>anodes...</b>|$|R
5|$|Membrane cell {{electrolysis}} employs permeable membrane as an ion exchanger. Saturated sodium (or potassium) chloride {{solution is}} {{passed through the}} <b>anode</b> compartment, leaving at a lower concentration. This method also produces very pure sodium (or potassium) hydroxide but has the disadvantage of requiring very pure brine at high concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by <b>anode</b> material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the <b>anode.</b> In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary <b>anode</b> (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} {{reactivity of}} zinc {{and its ability}} to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial <b>anode</b> in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the <b>anode</b> (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.|$|E
5|$|A third type {{of common}} {{maintenance}} is the installation and replacement of sacrificial <b>anodes</b> along the subterranean portions of pipeline. These <b>anodes</b> reduce the corrosion caused by electrochemical action that affect these interred sections of pipeline. Excavation and {{replacement of the}} <b>anodes</b> is required as they corrode.|$|R
30|$|Specimens No. 7 thru No. 10 (those {{containing}} embedded <b>anodes)</b> {{had less}} favorable total ratings {{than the control}} specimens. The embedded <b>anodes</b> appear to attract more chlorides to their vicinity which created variable chloride concentrations and non-uniform chloride penetrations in the laboratory specimens containing the embedded <b>anodes.</b>|$|R

5|$|Very pure lead can be {{obtained}} by processing smelted lead electrolytically using the Betts process. Anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead are placed in an electrolyte of lead fluorosilicate (PbSiF6). Once electrical potential is applied, impure lead at the <b>anode</b> dissolves and plates onto the cathode, leaving the majority of the impurities in solution.|$|E
5|$|ZnO is a {{promising}} <b>anode</b> material for lithium-ion battery {{because it is}} cheap, biocompatible, and environmentally friendly. ZnO has a higher theoretical capacity (978 mAh g−1) than many other transition metal oxides such as CoO (715 mAh g−1), NiO (718 mAh g−1) and CuO (674 mAh g−1).|$|E
5|$|A mercury–thallium alloy, {{which forms}} a {{eutectic}} at 8.5% thallium, {{is reported to}} freeze at−60°C, some 20°C below the freezing point of mercury. This alloy is used in thermometers and low-temperature switches. In organic synthesis, thallium(III) salts, as thallium trinitrate or triacetate, are useful reagents for performing different transformations in aromatics, ketones and olefins, among others. Thallium is a constituent of the alloy in the <b>anode</b> plates of magnesium seawater batteries. Soluble thallium salts are added to gold plating baths {{to increase the speed}} of plating and to reduce grain size within the gold layer.|$|E
5000|$|... "Spent" [...] <b>anodes</b> {{have little}} {{industrial}} use and are generally discarded; however, <b>anodes</b> {{that have been}} used to process aluminium fluoride may contain some amount of hydrogen fluoride and require hazardous waste disposal procedures. [...] Efforts to find industrial use for spent <b>anodes</b> have led to proposals to use the <b>anodes</b> as a cost-effective alternative for coke in small-scale foundries that lack a ready supply of coke, and cannot afford modern electric furnaces.|$|R
40|$|Extensive use of electrocatalytic {{processes}} {{call for}} the development of cheap and easily available materials for use as <b>anodes</b> in electrowinning operations. From energy and pollution considerations, replacing the existing carbon <b>anodes</b> with stable <b>anodes</b> are thought of and mixed oxides based composites have been identified as suitable <b>anodes.</b> The preparation of NiFe 2 O 4 and CoFe 2 O 4 compacts and their physical characteristics such as density and electrical conductivity are presented in this pape...|$|R
40|$|High {{oxidation}} potential indicates <b>anodes</b> {{have high}} oxidation power and high current efficiency for organics oxidation. In this paper, we prepared Ti/Cu-SnO 2 <b>anodes</b> using spray pyrolysis method. The Ti/Cu-SnO 2 <b>anodes</b> have an ultra-high oxidation potential of about 2. 7 V vs NHE, {{suitable for use}} in wastewater treatment. The Ti/Cu-SnO 2 <b>anodes</b> exhibit the preferred orientation along (110) plane at high Cu doped concentration. First-principles calculations suggest that work function of Cu-SnO 2 increases with the Cu doping concentration. It is obtained that the preferred (110) plane and the high work function {{are responsible for the}} enhanced oxidation potential of Ti/Cu-SnO 2 <b>anodes...</b>|$|R
5|$|Chloralkali process: The largest {{industrial}} use of mercury during the 20th century was in electrolysis for separating chlorine and sodium from brine; mercury being the <b>anode</b> of the Castner-Kellner process. The chlorine {{was used for}} bleaching paper (hence the location {{of many of these}} plants near paper mills) while the sodium was used to make sodium hydroxide for soaps and other cleaning products. This usage has largely been discontinued, replaced with other technologies that utilize membrane cells.|$|E
5|$|Iridium is also {{obtained}} commercially as {{a by-product}} from nickel and copper mining and processing. During electrorefining of copper and nickel, noble metals such as silver, gold and the platinum group metals {{as well as}} selenium and tellurium settle {{to the bottom of}} the cell as <b>anode</b> mud, which forms the starting point for their extraction. To separate the metals, they must first be brought into solution. Several separation methods are available depending on the nature of the mixture; two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia, and dissolution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid.|$|E
5|$|Vaporising the {{additional}} flux requires greater {{heat in the}} wire, so these gasless machines operate as DCEP, rather than the DCEN usually used for GMAW to give deeper penetration. DCEP, or DC Electrode Positive, makes the welding wire into the positively-charged <b>anode,</b> which is the hotter side of the arc. Provided that it is switchable from DCEN to DCEP, a gas-shielded wire-feed machine may {{also be used for}} flux-cored wire.|$|E

40|$|As {{part of the}} New Zealand Aluminium Smelters (NZAS) upgrade, a hot butt {{cleaning}} {{system has}} been proposed, this would remove the bath from <b>anodes</b> as they are removed from the cells. It is expected that the time to cool for hot cleaned <b>anodes</b> would be significantly less than for current method of allowing the butts to cool before the bath is removed. In this project a mathematical model of the cooling process of both the clean and dirty <b>anodes</b> is developed. This model will aid {{in the investigation of}} the hot butt cleaning system by showing the difference in cooling times between the clean and dirty <b>anodes.</b> The temperature profiles within both clean and dirty <b>anodes</b> is calculated for one-, two- and three-dimensional models. Temperature changes in the <b>anodes</b> with time are also compared to experimental data...|$|R
50|$|With {{three-phase}} {{alternating current}} and full-wave rectification, six <b>anodes</b> {{were used to}} provide a smoother direct current. Three phase operation can improve {{the efficiency of the}} transformer as well as providing smoother DC current by enabling two <b>anodes</b> to conduct simultaneously. During operation, the arc transfers to the <b>anodes</b> at the highest positive potential (with respect to the cathode).|$|R
5|$|Calcium, {{along with}} its {{congeners}} magnesium, strontium, and barium, was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1808. Following the work of Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Magnus Martin af Pontin on electrolysis, Davy isolated calcium and magnesium by putting a mixture of the respective metal oxides with mercury(II) oxide on a platinum plate which {{was used as the}} <b>anode,</b> the cathode being a platinum wire partially submerged into mercury. Electrolysis then gave calcium–mercury and magnesium–mercury amalgams, and distilling off the mercury gave the metal. However, pure calcium cannot be prepared in bulk by this method and a workable commercial process for its production was not found until over a century later.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 20th century, lithium {{became an}} {{important}} component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, {{should not be confused with}} lithium batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the <b>anode.</b> Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.|$|E
5|$|Niche uses {{of heavy}} metals with high atomic numbers occur in {{diagnostic}} imaging, electron microscopy, and nuclear science. In diagnostic imaging, heavy metals such as cobalt or tungsten {{make up the}} <b>anode</b> materials found in x-ray tubes. In electron microscopy, heavy metals such as lead, gold, palladium, platinum, or uranium are used to make conductive coatings and to introduce electron density into biological specimens by staining, negative staining, or vacuum deposition. In nuclear science, nuclei of heavy metals such as chromium, iron, or zinc are sometimes fired at other heavy metal targets to produce superheavy elements; heavy metals are also employed as spallation targets {{for the production of}} neutrons or radioisotopes such as astatine (using lead, bismuth, thorium, or uranium in the latter case).|$|E
50|$|Alba {{has three}} carbon plants that produce about 550,000 metric tonnes of <b>anodes</b> every year. Carbon <b>anodes</b> are {{produced}} from {{calcined petroleum coke}} and coal tar pitch.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s lithium-alloy <b>anodes</b> {{replaced}} calcium or magnesium <b>anodes,</b> with cathodes {{of calcium}} chromate, vanadium or tungsten oxides. Lithium-silicon alloys are favored over the earlier lithium-aluminium alloys. The corresponding cathode {{for use with}} the lithium-alloy <b>anodes</b> is mainly iron disulfide (pyrite) replaced by cobalt disulfide for high-power applications. The electrolyte is normally a eutectic mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|R
