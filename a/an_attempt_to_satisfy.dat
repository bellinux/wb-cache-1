2500|$|The {{idea of the}} {{priority}} method for constructing a r.e. set X is to list a countable sequence of requirements that X must satisfy. For example, to construct a r.e. set X between 0 and 0prime& {{it is enough to}} satisfy the requirements Ae and Be for each natural number e, where Ae requires that the oracle machine with index e does not compute 0prime& from X and Be requires that the Turing machine with index e (and no oracle) does not compute X. [...] These requirements are put into a priority ordering, which is an explicit bijection of the requirements and the natural numbers. The proof proceeds inductively with one stage for each natural number; these stages {{can be thought of as}} steps of time during which the set X is enumerated. [...] At each stage, numbers may be put into X or forever prevented from entering X in <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> requirements (that is, force them to hold once all of X has been enumerated). [...] Sometimes, a number can be enumerated into X to satisfy one requirement but doing this would cause a previously satisfied requirement to become unsatisfied (that is, to be injured). [...] The priority order on requirements is used to determine which requirement to satisfy in this case. [...] The informal idea is that if a requirement is injured then it will eventually stop being injured after all higher priority requirements have stopped being injured, although not every priority argument has this property. [...] An argument must be made that the overall set X is r.e. and satisfies all the requirements. Priority arguments can be used to prove many facts about r.e. sets; the requirements used and the manner in which they are satisfied must be carefully chosen to produce the required result.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} dynamic power {{management}} in a distributed multimedia system with a required quality of service (QoS). Using a generalized stochastic Petri net model where the non-exponential inter-arrival time distribution of the incoming requests is captured by the “stage method”, we provide a detailed model of the power-managed multimedia system under general QoS constraints. Based on this mathematical model, the power-optimal policy is obtained by solving a linear programming problem. We compare the new problem formulation and solution technique to previous dynamic power management techniques that can only optimize power under delay constraints. We then demonstrate that these other techniques yield policies with higher power dissipation by over-constraining the delay target in <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> indirectly <b>satisfy</b> the QoS constraints. In contrast, our new method correctly formulates the power management problem under QoS constraints and obtains the optimal solution. ...|$|R

40|$|Dagaare (Gur) is a {{two-tone}} {{language of}} northwestern Ghana with approximately 1, 000, 000 native speakers. Most of the canonical disyllabic nominals fall into three tonal classes: L-H, H-L and H-H. In the rst two, the second tone is a polarity tone: a su x assumes the opposite tone {{to that of}} the root. L-L is systematically absent. Based on our primary descriptive work, supplemented by the eldnotes of Kennedy (1966), we show that several tonal processes distinguish between lexical and derived tones and, in addition, there is evidence for penultimate stress. The surface tonal patterns result from <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> optimally <b>satisfy</b> (i) one-to-one correspondence between input tones, output tones and TBUs and (ii) the preference of stressed syllables for H and lexical tones. We show that the lexical/derived distinction and several familiar tonal phenomena, e. g. spreading, contour formation and oating tones can be captured by the notion of correspondence (McCarthy and Prince 1995). Tonal polarity is analyzed as a stress phenomenon: penultimate stress attracts lexical tones and leaves the unstressed nal syllable with whatever is the contextually optimal derived tone, i. e. the polarity tone. Similarly, underlyingly toneless words which are at least two syllables long become H-H due to stress which explains the systematic absence of L-L. ...|$|R

Three major circles of Yiddish folklore are analyzed: a folklore circle in Warsaw led by Noyekh Prilutski; the S.

Most works published by these circles are looked at in the context of how they employed Yiddish folklore to define themselves as members of a Jewish nation in a modern world.
