Also I have never dated a star {{and will never}} date one and that I can write <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> on a stamp paper. I am clear {{that there can be}} only one star in the relationship and that's me. I personally don't think it can work out between an actor and an actress." ...|$|E
500|$|In their {{previous}} bands, there {{had only been}} one guitarist, so having two was a new experience for all members. Paul felt two guitarists brought back the [...] "old school Iron Maiden thing where they play two parts <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a grinding rhythm part with a badass melody on top". In 2006, Mudvayne {{did not have any}} plans to tour and were taking most of the summer and fall off, while Nothingface was preparing to record their next album. The time over the summer allowed the band to pursue the project which had been talked about for years.|$|E
500|$|This {{decision}} was greatly resented by many Americans, particularly in 12th Army Group, {{who felt that}} the action discredited the U.S. Army's command structure. Heavy casualties {{since the start of}} Operation Overlord resulted in a critical shortage of infantry replacements even before the crisis situation created by the Ardennes Offensive. Steps were taken to divert men from Communications Zone units. The commander of the Communication Zone, Lieutenant General John C. H. Lee, persuaded Eisenhower to allow soldiers to volunteer for service [...] "without regard to color or race to the units where assistance is most needed, <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> the opportunity of fighting shoulder to shoulder to bring about victory".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the book was positive, particularly regarding the depth the book added to the Halo universe. Reviewer Eric Qualls commented that [...] " [...] interesting to read <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a much greater understanding" [...] to the universe. Qualls made a positive comparison to Robert A. Heinlein's Starship Troopers regarding the manner of story telling. GameCritics' Brad Gallaway also praised the back-story the book adds {{and the quality of}} the story. Fellow reviewer Gene Park noted the descriptions in the book went beyond what was presented in the game calling them [...] "vibrant and rousing." [...] He also complimented the characters presented in the novel saying they all [...] "fit nicely into the Halo universe" [...] but some times there were too many characters to remember. Sal Accardo of 3D Action Planet said of the book; [...] " [...] isn’t going to win any Pulitzers anytime soon. It’s well written, and a solid page-turner, but it’s still basically an action movie presented in book form" [...] but praised the gritty presentation of the Spartans. Don D'Ammasa of the Science Fiction Chronicle called the book [...] "competently written", but stated the plot was [...] "simpleminded".|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} he was {{appointed}} captain of the 64-gun [...] on 20 August, still in an acting capacity. Monmouth {{had been one of}} the most mutinous ships of the whole fleet, and was heavily involved in the Nore mutiny. Walker took her to join Admiral Adam Duncan's fleet in the North Sea. Within a short time he was able to restore good order aboard her, and was able to play a significant role in the Battle of Camperdown on 11 October. As she approached the Dutch fleet Walker gathered the crew and addressed them saying 'My lads, you see your enemy; I shall lay you close aboard <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> an opportunity of washing the stain off your characters in the blood of your foes. Now, go to your quarters and do your duty.' During the battle Monmouth engaged the Dutch ships Delft and Alkmaar for an hour and a half, forcing both of them to surrender. Monmouth, which had lost five men killed and 22 wounded, took Alkmaar in tow, and despite sailing through a strong gale, reached the shelter of Yarmouth roads five days later. The battle was a decisive victory for the British over the Dutch, and Walker was among those captains rewarded, having his post rank confirmed on 17 October, and receiving the Naval Gold Medal and the thanks of parliament. He attended the service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral on 19 December, and assisted in depositing the captured enemy colours.|$|E
500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better than anything that I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1947 Marx {{was asked}} to host a radio quiz program You Bet Your Life. It was {{broadcast}} by ABC and then CBS before moving to NBC. It moved from radio to television on October 5, 1950 and ran for eleven years. Filmed before a live audience, the show consisted of Marx bantering with the contestants and ad-libbing jokes before briefly quizzing them. The show was responsible for popularizing the phrases [...] "Say the secret word and the duck will come down <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> fifty dollars," [...] "Who's buried in Grant's Tomb?"

It used an autobiographical theme derived from elements of Broadway theater. She stated, [...] "To me, being onstage is about entertaining. I {{know there are}} people who just walk onstage <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a show by just doing their music, but I always wanted something extra". She added, [...] "I knew what I wanted everyone to look like, especially for the opening number. I knew what I wanted everyone to wear. I visualized the whole thing".

[...] Jackson conceptualized the tour in Paris, saying [...] "I knew what I wanted everyone to look like, especially for the opening number. I knew what I wanted everyone to wear. I visualized the whole thing." [...] Jackson desired to create new themes for prior hits to avoid repeating previous performances. The tour's logo is a variation of Akan symbol the Sankofa, meaning [...] "you can't move into the future until you understand your past." [...] Jackson tattooed the symbol onto her wrist and used the image frequently throughout the tour's promotional imagery.|$|E

He encouraged Jews to remove the barriers that stood between themselves and a closer relationship with God. They noted that the Hebrew letters of the word Breslov (ברסלב) can be rearranged to spell lev basar (לב בשר —the [...] "ס" [...] and [...] "ש" [...] sounds are interchangeable), [...] "a heart of flesh"—echoing the prophecy in Ezekiel (36:26): [...] "I [...] will take away your heart of stone <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a heart of flesh." [...] (For this reason, some adherents spell {{the name of}} the Hasidut, [...] "Breslev", stressing the lev (heart). Contemporary Breslov teacher Rabbi Shmuel Moshe Kramer of Jerusalem also noted that the gematria ("numerical value") of the Hebrew letters of Breslov (ברסלב) is 294, as is the Hebrew spelling of Nachman ben Faiga (נחמן בן פיגא) (Nachman son [...] Faiga)—the names of Rebbe Nachman and his mother.|$|E
